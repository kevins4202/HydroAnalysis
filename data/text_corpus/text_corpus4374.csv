21870,in this paper we first conduct an extensive review of published experimental studies on the added resistance of a ship in waves to establish a common database the data was enhanced by unpublished data from joint industry projects using this newly established database consisting of about 3 000 data points for 130 ships of different type and size we develop an empirical formula for approximating the added resistance in regular waves of arbitrary heading for the added resistance due to diffraction effect we updated faltinsen et al s 1980 asymptotic approach and introduced several semi empirical parameters to approximate the added resistance in waves of various headings the limited ship draft effect is examined analytically while the hull form effects are taken into account empirically by regression of available data for the radiation effect the maximum value of added resistance and the corresponding wavelength for the various wave headings are determined by regression analysis of the experimental data the developed formula is verified by application to typical ship types and sizes both in the design and ballast conditions at both design and low speeds an error analysis for the various tested scenarios shows that the performance of the developed formula is satisfactory keywords added resistance in waves experimental database regression analysis semi empirical formula ballast condition following waves 1 introduction the added resistance of ships in waves is nowadays of significant concern for both ship designers and ship operators traditionally it was always of concern for the speed power performance of a ship but this gained importance in the last decade especially after the introduction of international imo regulations on ships energy efficiency and the control of toxic gas emissions from maritime operations imo mepc 2012 2013 in fact in low to moderate sea states the added resistance affects mainly ship s fuel consumption thus it is related to ship s economy and environmental impact through the greenhouse gas and toxic gas emissions of ship s engine in high sea states however it affects both ship s speed power performance but may also trigger safety issues as when the speed drops significantly involuntary and voluntary speed loss reduction a ship may not be able to maneuver efficiently this is particularly valid for underpowered ships such as tankers and bulk carriers finally it is also an important issue in several practical problems of ship s operation such as speed correction in sea trials fuel performance analysis route optimization weather routing etc the present scientific subject is complex in many respects in low sea states where waves of small periods dominate namely relatively short waves most of the classic seakeeping theories and associated numerical tools struggle to yield accurate predictions for the added resistance as a remedy several semi empirical methods have been proposed in higher sea states nonlinear motion phenomena are the main obstacle to obtain accurate predictions in recent benchmark studies bunnik et al 2010 shigunov et al 2018 some odd performance of even advanced numerical tools cfd was observed it appears that the development of satisfactory numerical tools will still take time to achieve maturity in addition in some practical applications where the detailed hull form is still under development or when the detailed hull form information is not available a fast and simple to use method which can capture satisfactorily the physical phenomena based on a limited number of main ship particulars is preferred in this respect a well established empirical formula seems to be the only practical solution when developing numerical tools either advanced full scale cfd simulations tezdogan et al 2015 or less complicated panel codes liu et al 2011 or even more simplified empirical formulas a rich and reliable experimental database is required for validation and finetuning of the ensuing methods it should be pointed out that the added resistance is essentially a quantity derived from a quasi nonlinear seakeeping study while the result is essentially a resistance component as a quasi 2nd order quantity the measurement of the added resistance involves large uncertainties which are related to the small measured quantities and the quality of the generated incident waves thus the problem is highly demanding also from the experimental point of view in setting up an experimental database for added resistance values the challenge is manifold first of all there are different measuring approaches of the added resistance namely either measuring the resistance of a towed model or of a self propelled model following the recommendation of nakamura 1966 the towed model method is generally preferred as it reduces the uncertainties involved in the components of the propulsive efficiency in waves second factor is the model size which is restricted among others by the testing tank size when the model size is small the uncertainty will be high as the measured values will become very small in the range of few newtons this is particularly important when studying the added resistance of a ship in waves that are short relative to ship length as the size of the model also affects the magnitude of the wave amplitude and length of the modelled waves it is admitted lee 2008 that obtaining accurate experimental data on added resistance is difficult because of the small drag increments to be measured in spite that the used model had a length of 8 49 m the third uncertainty factor comes from conducting tests with different hardware and experimental configurations at different tanks for the added resistance in oblique waves tests were conducted in towing tanks with side wave makers or in maneuvering tanks ocean basins tests conducted in these facilities will face different challenges that increase the uncertainties in the former case normally there is no restriction on speed but on wave heading while in the latter case normally there is no restriction on wave heading but on model size speed last but not least the scale effect on added resistance tests that are conducted according to froude s scaling law is another issue that rarely was discussed particularly where viscosity effects play an increased role both in the short and long wave regions all the aforementioned factors are valid for tests both in regular and irregular waves for tests in irregular waves a specific challenge refers to the measuring time which should be long enough to enable the derived statistics to achieve the desired 95 confidence level this leads to many runs in tanks of limited length to accumulate sufficient exposure time besides all the challenges mentioned above it should be born in mind that such tests require in addition properly trained personnel and that using large testing facility is very demanding expensive and time consuming fig 1 shows the measured non dimensional added resistance as a function of the wavelength to ship length ratio λ lpp of the kriso container ship kcs by several tanks using models of different sizes at different times and waves of different steepness large scattering is observed particularly in short waves and around the resonance region this example brings up a question what is the correct benchmark for the validation of software tools and algorithms for the added resistance problem considering the afore mentioned factors it appears that when validating a numerical method it is not sufficient to evaluate the performance of the method by comparing the numerical results against a single set of experimental data but the uncertainty of the experimental data needs also to be critically taken into account in this paper we first review results of published experimental studies on added resistance in waves which were conducted in the last 5 decades since the 1960s particularly those with available hull form data in the public domain which enable the setting up of a comprehensive database to support the development of related numerical tools this database was herein enhanced by unpublished data made available to the authors in the frame of various joint industry projects using this newly established database consisting of about 3 000 data points for about 130 ships of different types and sizes we developed an empirical formula for approximating the added resistance in regular waves of arbitrary heading while improving our earlier proposed formula liu and papanikolaou 2016 2019 finally an error analysis is conducted for various scenarios to demonstrate the efficiency of the new formula 2 review of experimental studies results of analytical numerical and experimental added resistance or drift force studies of simple mathematical hull forms are useful for validating numerical tools in the development stage of a software they are also of value when studying some extreme cases where it is difficult to execute experiments havelock 1940 derived a formula to calculate the steady force acting on a fixed cylinder with vertical sides in waves beukelman 1983 measured the motions hydrodynamic coefficients and added resistance on a rectangular and a triangular cylindrical body at zero and two speeds of advance in response to regular waves higo and ha 1991 studied the drift force on a vertical circular cylinder due to diffraction effect at low speeds iwashita and ohkusu 1992 studied the second order force of a submerged ellipsoid with suppressed responses in incident head waves at zero speed and at forward speed it is also worth to note that nakamura 1975 presented a collection of early literature concerning the resistance increase and propulsive performance in waves while most of this early data do not refer to practical hull forms it is important to examine them in validation and comparative studies in this paper attention is given mainly to ship models referring to large seagoing commercial ships as the main objective of this study is to support the development of a semi empirical formula for easy use by the maritime industry table 1 presents the public domain experimental studies on standard models ships with available lines plan table 2 presents the tank test results of typical ship types without lines plan available to public or with only part of the lines available or with only main particulars available as it is always possible to find some hull form information of similar designs in the long term these data can also be exploited for empirical use 3 the established database besides the earlier addressed data from the public domain we obtained additional data through various joint industry projects jips on this background our database of experimental data for the added resistance which has been continuously enriched over the last 10 years includes nowadays data for about 130 ships which were tested in various conditions as elaborated below out of the total sample of slightly more than 3 000 data points 1 500 data points refer to head wave conditions and another 1 500 data points to other headings as shown in figs 2 and 3 fig 4 shows the breakdown of the ships in the database per ship type the bulk carriers constitute 17 and the oil tankers 18 of the ships in the database the fast cargo ships including containerships lng carriers pccs and general cargo ships etc constitute 22 the remaining part includes passenger ships very slender ships mathematical models and various models ships of unknown features this breakdown is quite representative for the world fleet share of ship types fig 5 shows important main particulars and coefficients of the ships in the database the ship length between perpendiculars lpp ranges between 90 m and 383 m with several datasets in model scale only the block coefficient cb of the containerships ranges roughly from 0 55 to 0 65 while for tankers and bulk carriers from 0 75 to 0 85 the majority of ship length to beam ratios l b range from slightly over 5 to slightly over 7 5 the beam to draft ratios b t range from roughly 2 5 to 4 5 in design condition and in ballast condition this value increases significantly these ratios are in the common range of systematically analysed ship data papanikolaou 2014 the froude number fr spreads from 0 0 to approximately 0 30 this wide spreading is because the prediction method was initially developed to support the assessment of minimum power in adverse weather condition which is typically a low speed problem regarding the wave heading most of the test cases were for head waves 180 degree only for off head bow waves 21 sets of data were collected while for following astern waves 11 datasets were available 4 some improvements of the earlier formula for head waves 4 1 influence of slenderness on the added resistance following the study of jinkine and ferdinande 1974 the value of ωmax where the maximum added resistance is observed depends solely upon the froude number fr and the nondimensional radius of gyration of pitch kyy but not on the ship s hull form this conclusion was based on the examination of added resistance data for the few fast cargo ships with cb in between 0 564 and 0 653 and b t in between 2 4 and 2 72 in an earlier study by the present authors liu and papanikolaou 2019 cb was introduced in the prediction of ω m a x but this was only used together with b t for capturing the effect of draft examining the added resistance of two series 60 ships with block coefficients cb 0 65 and 0 80 at two speeds using the far field method liu et al 2011 it proved that the full hull forms tend to have their peak added resistance due to vertical plane motion resonance at higher non dimensional wavelengths than the fine hull forms namely towards longer waves as shown in fig 6 this observation is also confirmed by the collected experimental data from various sources at similar speeds the shown experimental results in blue which are the added resistance of fine ships have their maximum values at lower non dimensional wavelengths than the maximum values of the experimental results in red which are the added resistance of full ships at similar speed this graph illustrates the influence of hull form particularly of block coefficient on the peak of the added resistance following this preliminary observation a more extensive study was conducted two groups of added resistance data were collected for ships with cb 0 55 0 65 and cb 0 80 0 85 respectively the location of maximum added resistance i e the corresponding λ lpp value is plotted versus froude number fig 7 shows the obtained results clearly the green squares are below the blue circles which is essentially the same as what has been observed in fig 6 the green curve is the predicted location of maximum added resistance for a ship with cb 0 60 following the original prediction formula though the predicted values are higher than the observations from experimental results considering that originally the results were plotted iwith respect to frequency this deviation should have been expected therefore it is advisable to introduce a cb based parameter when predicting the location of the maximum added resistance for a ship as shown by the blue curve in the graph 4 2 character of added resistance in ballast condition it was noted in previous studies of the authors that the features of added resistance of the kvlcc2 model in ballast condition are different from that of added resistance in full load condition with the dimensionless added resistance in short waves tending to be higher while the maximum added resistance is observed at shorter wave lengths to account for this the beam to draft ratio b t and trim angle were introduced to extend the formula to the ballast condition scenario we worked out first the influence of the reduced draft then examined the difference in added resistance between the trimmed ballast condition and the even keel condition with the same mean draft as in ballast condition and attributed the difference to the influence of the trim this methodology has been elaborated in previously published work liu and papanikolaou 2019 after setting up the new database more experimental data of the added resistance of ships in ballast condition could be collected as shown in fig 8 overall the shape of the curves of the non dimensional added resistance in head waves and in ballast condition resembles each other very much which confirmes the specific feature of added resistance in ballast condition the trim factor is then tuned according to the new experimental database 5 new formula for added resistance in waves of arbitrary heading 5 1 added resistance due to diffraction effect in waves of arbitrary headings according to faltinsen et al s method 1980 the added resistance in short waves is calculated as 1 r a w r c f e sin θ d l where the acting steady quasi second order pressure force per unit length of the waterline f e is 2 f e 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ α 2 ω 0 u g 1 cos θ cos θ a and the integration is reduced to the non shadowed area of the waterline fig 9 shows the definition of the incident wave angle α and the waterline segment inclination angle θ in following waves the formula is reduced to 3 f e 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ 2 ω 0 u g 1 cos 2 θ which means the force elements are always in positive direction because in following waves only the stern is exposed to the incident waves the sine value of the astern waterline elements is always negative thus the integration outcome is always negative which means an additional wave induced thrust force however this may be valid only for zero or small forward speed whereas viscous effects need also to be considered when the ship speed is high this 2nd order drift force effect will have in general a positive added resistance value revisiting faltinsen et al s formula and assuming the steady fluid velocity vu cosθ where u is the ship s speed we may obtain the following expression 4 f e f e u 0 f e δ u 1 4 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ α sin θ α sin θ α 2 ω 0 u sin θ sin θ α g 2 ω 0 u sin θ sin 2 θ α g sin θ α if sin θ α 0 which indicates the non shadowed part of the waterline 5 f e 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ α 2 ω 0 u sin θ sin θ α g 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ α 2 ω 0 u g cos α cos θ cos θ α this is in accordance to what sakamoto and baba 1986 have derived if sin θ α 0 which indicates the shadowed part of the waterline 6 f e 0 in following waves the formula is reduced to 7 f e 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ 2 ω 0 u g 1 cos 2 θ 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ 1 2 ω 0 u g from the above expression it is understood that for high speed or low frequency the force element will have a negative value hence the integration will become positive which means a resistance this is easily understood when considering the transom stern with sin θ 1 if we set the force to be zero namely 8 f e 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ 1 2 ω 0 u g 0 2 ω 0 u g 1 u g 2 ω 0 v c 2 v g when the ship speed is half of the incident wave s propagating speed phase velocity vc or equal to the incident wave s group velocity vg the mean force will be zero this is consistent with the fact that the wave energy is propagated at group velocity though the wave still overtakes the ship for ships with simple smooth waterline shape at the stern for cruiser type sterns we may apply the same concept as for head waves namely introducing a length of run lr as defined in fig 10 to approximate the bluntness coefficient for following waves then the added resistance due to the diffraction effect can be approximated as 9 r a w r 2 25 2 ρ g b α t ζ a 2 sin 2 e 2 α 2 ω 0 u g cos α cos e 2 cos e 2 α it is noted that the form factor 0 87 c b 1 4 f n which accounts for the complicated hydrodynamic phenomena induced by the sharp corner at the bow liu et al 2015 is neglected in the following wave case this is because in general the astern hull form is comparably smooth to ensure a favorable flow to the propellerdisk modern ship types however often feature extreme transom stern waterline forms for instance extended overhanging transom stern hence it is necessary to use more segments to properly represent the waterline profile when high accuracy is required 5 2 the influence of ship s draft on added resistance due to diffraction effect following the concept of calculating the added resistance of a restrained hull of draft t which advances in head waves from the integral of the pressure acting on the vertical projection of the hull surface ogiwara et al 1996 derived an expression to include the draft effect as follows 10 r a w r 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b 1 e 2 k t 2 ω 0 u g b f where the bluntness coefficient is defined as 11 b f 2 b 0 b 2 sin 2 θ d y in our formula liu et al 2016 we followed kwon s reasoning on the draft effect 1981 and adopted the draft factor smith effect of 12 α t 1 e 2 k t substituting this coefficient into the asymptotic formula will yield 13 r awr 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b 1 e 2 kt 1 2 ω v g b f 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b 1 e 2 kt 2 ω v g 2 ω ve 2 kt g b f the difference of this expression from that of ogiwara et al 1996 is the inclusion of the last higher order term in the parentheses from eq 13 it is also clear that the nondimensional added resistance r a w ρ g ζ α 2 b 2 l p p in very short waves at zero speed approaches to a constant value while at nonzero speed goes to infinite it should be noted that ζ α of infinitesimal waves is also infinitesimal thus the absolute added resistance in very short waves is still zero as the wave steepness is of finite value as pointed out by liu and papanikolaou 2017 nevertheless the local draft at stern is sometimes very small hence significantly affects the diffraction effect this effect calls for more detailed studies 5 3 added resistance due to radiation effect in following waves consider an aft fore symmetric ship since the existing formula is able to yield a prediction of the added resistance in head waves at zero speed then the following waves case can also be predicted in that case in following waves at zero speed it is understood that the added resistance or drift force has a negative value pushing the ship 14 r awm 4 ρ g ζ a 2 b 2 l p p a 1 a 2 ω b 1 e b 1 d 1 1 ω d 1 where ω 2 142 k y y 3 l p p λ 1 0 111 c b

2 66 f o r ω 1 566 l p p b 2 66 e l s e w h e r e fig 11 shows the added resistance of a bulk carrier in following waves at zero speed predicted by this formula how will the added resistance change as a ship speeds up in following waves let us consider an extreme case namely a ship sailing at very high speed in following waves in such a situation as the ship travels faster than the wave the ship will feel an added resistance namely a force opposite to the direction it sails obviously as the speed increases from zero the added resistance changes gradually from negative to positive we further analyze this phenomenon assuming deep water condition in following waves when ship s speed u equals the wave s celerity phase velocity vc u vc g λ 2 π the ship will travel with the wave while the incident wave profile retains the same relative position with the ship and interacts with ship s steady wave profile however as pointed out before from energy point of view the incident wave energy is traveling with the wave group velocity at vc 2 and some energy exchange will take place between the ship and wave which will induce oscillatory motions in order to see under what condition the added resistance becomes zero which is a complex phenomenon we explore our experimental database fig 12 shows the experimental results for the added resistance of several ships in following waves starting from zero speed to moderate speed scrutinizing these data it is noted that the maximum added resistance approaches zero when uvc 4 as plotted in fig 13 thus let us assume that the turning point for the change of the maxima of added resistance in following waves is when u vc 4 recalling that at zero speed the wave is pushing the ship we may state that the ship consumes some energy when its speed exceeds vc 4 thus experiences some added resistance assuming a linear relationship with ship speed the added resistance exerting on the ship when sailing with vc 2 will be similar to that of the case when the ship is excited by a head wave of the same length at zero speed since we herein assumed that the ship is fore aft symmetric when u vc 2 in following waves this case can be considered the same as a ship traveling at a speed of u vc 2 in head waves thus re examining the results of fig 13 we conclude 1 on the x axis corresponding to fr 0 the original formula is applied and the added resistance is negative thus a pushing force added thrust 2 on the curve u vc 4 the added resistance due to radiation effect is zero 3 on the curve u vc 2 the added resistance due to radiation effect equals to the added resistance of the ship at zero speed in head waves 4 the maximum value of added resistance at any condition between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3 can be approximated by linear interpolation 5 added resistance at any condition above the u vc 2 curve can be approximated by applying the original formula using a relative froude number of u vc 2 g l 5 4 added resistance due to radiation effect in waves of various headings by now we have found a solution for the added resistance due to radiation effect in head waves and following waves the next task is to work out the added resistance due to radiation effect in waves of arbitrary heading for the concerned empirical formula it is important to identify the location wave period length where the maximum nondimensional added resistance is observed as well as this maximum value for this reason several sets of data including the added resistance of a bulk carrier at fr 0 0 and 0 1 the added resistance of a second bulk carrier at fr 0 128 and the added resistance of s175 ship at fr 0 15 and 0 25 have been examined to sort out the values of interest figs 14 and 15 show the location of raw max and the values of raw max a1a2 as a function of wave heading α of various ships at various speeds it is observed that these values can be fairly well approximated by introducing some wave heading based trigonometric functions by exploiting the newly gained knowledge it is possible to make a prediction of the added resistance of ships of different types at various speeds in waves of any heading the quadratic transfer functions of added resistance in regular head to following waves r a w can be calculated as the sum of r awm the component of added resistance due to motion radiation effect and r awr the component of added resistance due to reflection diffraction effect in regular waves 15 r aw r awm r awr the expression of r awm is given as follows 16 r awm 4 ρ g ζ a 2 b 2 l p p a 1 a 2 a 3 ω b 1 e b

fr on ω is now expressed with polynomials in the last brackets for head waves the current formulation is identical to the previous expression proposed by the authors liu and papanikolaou 2019 but it is now generalised for capturing the effect of different wave headings the expression of r a w r takes the following form 17 r awr i 1 4 r awr i r awr i is the added resistance due to reflection

zero speed in comparison with experimental results fig 18 shows the obtained results of the added resistance of the s175 ship at moderate speed in comparison with experimental results fujii and takahashi 1975 qualitatively a reasonable prediction accuracy has been demonstrated it is also noted that the added resistance asymptotically approaches zero value when the wavelength to ship length ratio λ l becomes larger or tends to infinity this can be deduced from potential flow theory reasoning both the motion radiation and diffraction effects goes to zero but in reality there are still some viscosity effects present that lead to non zero values as evidenced by tank test results and verified by cfd simulations see e g el moctar et al 2017 6 preliminary error analysis of estimated added resistance in regular waves of arbitrary heading the available experimental data is herein used as the yardstick for the assessment of the performance of the developed empirical formula several parameters are used to assess the quality of the prediction the mean percentage error and the absolute percentage error are defined as follows ε m e a n 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i y i ε a b s 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i y i where y i is the experimental value and y ˆ i is the predicted value using the formula the pearson s r correlation coefficient is defined as follows r n y y ˆ i y y ˆ i n y 2 y 2 n y ˆ i 2 y ˆ i 2 the standard deviation σ of the differences between predicted values and experimental values is calculated as σ 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 the mean absolute error mae which is the average of the absolute difference between the predicted values and experimental values is calculated as m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i table 3 shows the main particulars of twenty ships of various types and sizes that are used in assessing the prediction of added resistance in waves of various headings in both laden and ballast conditions from zero speed to design speed fig 19 shows the predicted added resistance of eight full type ships in design or laden condition in regular head waves at design speed in comparison with corresponding experimental results the errors of predictions are very low with εmean 1 3 while εabs 14 7 the correlation coefficient r 0 956 σ 0 624 and mae 0 499 the 20 difference line is also presented for reference purpose overall the prediction is satisfactory fig 20 shows the predicted added resistance of six full type ships in ballast condition in regular head waves at design speed in comparison with the experimental results the obtained εmean 21 9 εabs 26 2 r 0 948 σ 0 777 mae 0 657 this calculated error is herein larger than in the case of full type ships in design condition this is partly due to the observed underprediction in short waves as shown in the graph it is noted that the majority of the herein used experimental data is from tested models of small ship length namely 2 9 m for cases where larger models were used an overestimation has been observed this indicates that the uncertainty of the accumulated experimental data is significant and the formula should be further tuned upon the availability of additional data particularly data with greater accuracy and higher reliability fig 21 shows the correlation of the predicted added resistance of seven fast cargo ships of lengths 175 m 351 m in laden or ballast condition in regular head waves at moderate speeds fr 0 183 0 3 with the experimental results the correlation has a lower value than in the previous cases 0 918 which is readily visible from the scattering of the data a large deviation was here observed with σ 1 37 mae 0 999 this might be due to larger uncertainties associated with the higher test speeds the obtained errors are εmean 1 6 and εabs 22 6 fig 22 shows the predicted added resistance of six ships of lengths 175 m 383 m in laden or ballast conditions in regular waves of random headings at moderate speeds fr 0 183 0 3 in comparison with the experimental results the obtained correlation coefficient r standard deviation σ mae εmean and εabs values for each case are presented in table 4 from the obtained statistics the performance in bow waves is as good as the performance in head waves for waves propagating in transverse direction with 60 o α 120 o much less data is available for cases with forward speed due to the restriction of the experimental set up the obtained σ and mae are slightly larger than those in bow waves however because the added resistance in this region is smaller than in bow waves the relative error becomes rather large εabs 42 2 in oblique stern waves with 0 o α 60 o the added resistance is much smaller than that in bow waves in addition due to the doppler effect the frequency of encounter reduces very fast thus making the measurement more challenging both factors make the measurements vulnerable to large uncertainties thus giving a rather low correlation r 0 684 note that the achieved σ 0 614 and mae 0 459 are even smaller than in other headings however the relative error is large εabs 76 4 at present state of knowledge it cannot be expected that the performance of numerical prediction methods in this heading region can be improved without working on the establishment of a solid experimental database to verify and to fine tune numerical predictions nevertheless due to its relatively small contribution to the mean added resistance when considering directional seaways this error is less important from a practical viewpoint fig 23 shows the predicted added resistance of four ships of lengths 178 m 355 m in laden conditions in regular waves of arbitrary headings at low speeds fr 0 06 in comparison with the experimental results the obtained correlation coefficient r standard deviation σ mae εmean and εabs values for each case are presented in table 5 this is a special case that is strongly related to presently heated discussions about the minimum required power to maintain manoeuvrability in adverse conditions for bow waves with 120 o α 180 o the obtained εmean 3 0 and εabs 33 1 which indicates that the predictions scatter is well around the experimental results for beam waves with 60 o α 120 o less data are available for cases with forward speed due to the restriction of the experimental set up the obtained σ and mae are in the same range as those in bow waves however because the added resistance in this region is smaller than in bow waves the relative error becomes larger with εmean 19 4 and εabs 38 7 in stern waves with 0 o α 60 o though the achieved σ 0 518 and mae 0 414 are smaller than in other headings as the added resistance is much smaller than that in bow waves the obtained correlation coefficient is rather low r 0 583 and the relative error is εmean 10 5 and εabs 52 6 considering the overall good performance of the formula at moderate speeds the decreased performance at low speeds might be credited to various reasons first the tank tests results tend to be more uncertain as discussed earlier tank wall effects at low speed are also more significant at low speed as shown by yuan et al 2018 secondly the experimental data are rather limited thus the associated uncertainties are large thirdly as discussed by duan and li 2013 the influence of speed on added resistance due to diffraction effect is actually nonlinear whereas in the present formula we apply a linear model more investigations both experimental and analytical need to be conducted before concluding among others we are working on the analysis of data using artificial neural networks anns as demonstrated very recently in this subject area by cepowski 2020 7 summary and conclusions in this paper we first reviewed systematically various public domain experimental studies on the added resistance of ships in waves and established a unique database which was enriched by additional data from joint industry projects of ntua ship design laboratory registered ships in the database are within the range of 80 m l pp 380 m 5 0 l b 7 5 2 0 b t 8 0 0 54 c b 0 87 0 0 fr 0 3 which is representative for the global merchant cargo ship fleet the database includes data of ships in both ballast and full load conditions at various speeds and in waves of arbitrary headings the set up experimental database which includes more than 3 000 data points for 130 ships of various types and sizes has been exploited to formulate an empirical method for the estimation of the added resistance in waves and of associated added powering as necessary for the practical use in ship design and assessment of ship operation experimental data for the ballast condition were also examined and helped to calibrate related parameters on this basis we refined an earlier version of the empirical formula of the authors for the added resistance which should be now applicable to waves of any heading and cargo ships of various types in full load and ballast condition several correction factors were examined to more accurately consider the ship s draft effect the hull form influence etc for short waves we improved the empirical formula for the added resistance based on faltinsen et al s asymptotic approach by introducing two empirical parameters namely the length of entrance le and length of run lr of ship s waterline for long waves we improved the empirical formula of jinkine and ferdinande 1974 by introducing hull form parameters such as cb b t kyy and trim etc for the trickier case of following waves we tackled the problem by applying first principles namely investigating the energy exchange between the ship and incidental wave wherever there is a shortage of insight due to complexity we used experimental results to test our assumptions we also extended the formula to beam waves heuristically following classical seakeeping theory deliberations for stern oblique waves a linear interpolation between beam and following waves was applied considering that the concerned added resistance quantity is relatively small on this basis our proposed empirical formula that covers the added resistance of merchant ships in full load and ballast condition operatingin waves of arbitrary heading was derived the developed formula was applied to several typical types of ships including bulk carriers tankers containerships etc in both full load and ballast conditions from very low speed to design speed in waves of arbitrary heading the results are compared with experimental data from the public domain that can be independently verified an error analysis shows that a promising agreement has been obtained the proposed empirical formula uses very simple input and algebraic expressions that can be readily programmed on a pocket calculator and enables the transparent and satisfactory estimation of the added resistance of ships in waves this facilitates the wider application of the formula by the industry particularly where the detailed hull form and advanced software tools are not available the proposed formula may be also used for speed corrections in sea trials the minimum power assessment in the frame of recent eedi regulations fuel performance

21870,in this paper we first conduct an extensive review of published experimental studies on the added resistance of a ship in waves to establish a common database the data was enhanced by unpublished data from joint industry projects using this newly established database consisting of about 3 000 data points for 130 ships of different type and size we develop an empirical formula for approximating the added resistance in regular waves of arbitrary heading for the added resistance due to diffraction effect we updated faltinsen et al s 1980 asymptotic approach and introduced several semi empirical parameters to approximate the added resistance in waves of various headings the limited ship draft effect is examined analytically while the hull form effects are taken into account empirically by regression of available data for the radiation effect the maximum value of added resistance and the corresponding wavelength for the various wave headings are determined by regression analysis of the experimental data the developed formula is verified by application to typical ship types and sizes both in the design and ballast conditions at both design and low speeds an error analysis for the various tested scenarios shows that the performance of the developed formula is satisfactory keywords added resistance in waves experimental database regression analysis semi empirical formula ballast condition following waves 1 introduction the added resistance of ships in waves is nowadays of significant concern for both ship designers and ship operators traditionally it was always of concern for the speed power performance of a ship but this gained importance in the last decade especially after the introduction of international imo regulations on ships energy efficiency and the control of toxic gas emissions from maritime operations imo mepc 2012 2013 in fact in low to moderate sea states the added resistance affects mainly ship s fuel consumption thus it is related to ship s economy and environmental impact through the greenhouse gas and toxic gas emissions of ship s engine in high sea states however it affects both ship s speed power performance but may also trigger safety issues as when the speed drops significantly involuntary and voluntary speed loss reduction a ship may not be able to maneuver efficiently this is particularly valid for underpowered ships such as tankers and bulk carriers finally it is also an important issue in several practical problems of ship s operation such as speed correction in sea trials fuel performance analysis route optimization weather routing etc the present scientific subject is complex in many respects in low sea states where waves of small periods dominate namely relatively short waves most of the classic seakeeping theories and associated numerical tools struggle to yield accurate predictions for the added resistance as a remedy several semi empirical methods have been proposed in higher sea states nonlinear motion phenomena are the main obstacle to obtain accurate predictions in recent benchmark studies bunnik et al 2010 shigunov et al 2018 some odd performance of even advanced numerical tools cfd was observed it appears that the development of satisfactory numerical tools will still take time to achieve maturity in addition in some practical applications where the detailed hull form is still under development or when the detailed hull form information is not available a fast and simple to use method which can capture satisfactorily the physical phenomena based on a limited number of main ship particulars is preferred in this respect a well established empirical formula seems to be the only practical solution when developing numerical tools either advanced full scale cfd simulations tezdogan et al 2015 or less complicated panel codes liu et al 2011 or even more simplified empirical formulas a rich and reliable experimental database is required for validation and finetuning of the ensuing methods it should be pointed out that the added resistance is essentially a quantity derived from a quasi nonlinear seakeeping study while the result is essentially a resistance component as a quasi 2nd order quantity the measurement of the added resistance involves large uncertainties which are related to the small measured quantities and the quality of the generated incident waves thus the problem is highly demanding also from the experimental point of view in setting up an experimental database for added resistance values the challenge is manifold first of all there are different measuring approaches of the added resistance namely either measuring the resistance of a towed model or of a self propelled model following the recommendation of nakamura 1966 the towed model method is generally preferred as it reduces the uncertainties involved in the components of the propulsive efficiency in waves second factor is the model size which is restricted among others by the testing tank size when the model size is small the uncertainty will be high as the measured values will become very small in the range of few newtons this is particularly important when studying the added resistance of a ship in waves that are short relative to ship length as the size of the model also affects the magnitude of the wave amplitude and length of the modelled waves it is admitted lee 2008 that obtaining accurate experimental data on added resistance is difficult because of the small drag increments to be measured in spite that the used model had a length of 8 49 m the third uncertainty factor comes from conducting tests with different hardware and experimental configurations at different tanks for the added resistance in oblique waves tests were conducted in towing tanks with side wave makers or in maneuvering tanks ocean basins tests conducted in these facilities will face different challenges that increase the uncertainties in the former case normally there is no restriction on speed but on wave heading while in the latter case normally there is no restriction on wave heading but on model size speed last but not least the scale effect on added resistance tests that are conducted according to froude s scaling law is another issue that rarely was discussed particularly where viscosity effects play an increased role both in the short and long wave regions all the aforementioned factors are valid for tests both in regular and irregular waves for tests in irregular waves a specific challenge refers to the measuring time which should be long enough to enable the derived statistics to achieve the desired 95 confidence level this leads to many runs in tanks of limited length to accumulate sufficient exposure time besides all the challenges mentioned above it should be born in mind that such tests require in addition properly trained personnel and that using large testing facility is very demanding expensive and time consuming fig 1 shows the measured non dimensional added resistance as a function of the wavelength to ship length ratio λ lpp of the kriso container ship kcs by several tanks using models of different sizes at different times and waves of different steepness large scattering is observed particularly in short waves and around the resonance region this example brings up a question what is the correct benchmark for the validation of software tools and algorithms for the added resistance problem considering the afore mentioned factors it appears that when validating a numerical method it is not sufficient to evaluate the performance of the method by comparing the numerical results against a single set of experimental data but the uncertainty of the experimental data needs also to be critically taken into account in this paper we first review results of published experimental studies on added resistance in waves which were conducted in the last 5 decades since the 1960s particularly those with available hull form data in the public domain which enable the setting up of a comprehensive database to support the development of related numerical tools this database was herein enhanced by unpublished data made available to the authors in the frame of various joint industry projects using this newly established database consisting of about 3 000 data points for about 130 ships of different types and sizes we developed an empirical formula for approximating the added resistance in regular waves of arbitrary heading while improving our earlier proposed formula liu and papanikolaou 2016 2019 finally an error analysis is conducted for various scenarios to demonstrate the efficiency of the new formula 2 review of experimental studies results of analytical numerical and experimental added resistance or drift force studies of simple mathematical hull forms are useful for validating numerical tools in the development stage of a software they are also of value when studying some extreme cases where it is difficult to execute experiments havelock 1940 derived a formula to calculate the steady force acting on a fixed cylinder with vertical sides in waves beukelman 1983 measured the motions hydrodynamic coefficients and added resistance on a rectangular and a triangular cylindrical body at zero and two speeds of advance in response to regular waves higo and ha 1991 studied the drift force on a vertical circular cylinder due to diffraction effect at low speeds iwashita and ohkusu 1992 studied the second order force of a submerged ellipsoid with suppressed responses in incident head waves at zero speed and at forward speed it is also worth to note that nakamura 1975 presented a collection of early literature concerning the resistance increase and propulsive performance in waves while most of this early data do not refer to practical hull forms it is important to examine them in validation and comparative studies in this paper attention is given mainly to ship models referring to large seagoing commercial ships as the main objective of this study is to support the development of a semi empirical formula for easy use by the maritime industry table 1 presents the public domain experimental studies on standard models ships with available lines plan table 2 presents the tank test results of typical ship types without lines plan available to public or with only part of the lines available or with only main particulars available as it is always possible to find some hull form information of similar designs in the long term these data can also be exploited for empirical use 3 the established database besides the earlier addressed data from the public domain we obtained additional data through various joint industry projects jips on this background our database of experimental data for the added resistance which has been continuously enriched over the last 10 years includes nowadays data for about 130 ships which were tested in various conditions as elaborated below out of the total sample of slightly more than 3 000 data points 1 500 data points refer to head wave conditions and another 1 500 data points to other headings as shown in figs 2 and 3 fig 4 shows the breakdown of the ships in the database per ship type the bulk carriers constitute 17 and the oil tankers 18 of the ships in the database the fast cargo ships including containerships lng carriers pccs and general cargo ships etc constitute 22 the remaining part includes passenger ships very slender ships mathematical models and various models ships of unknown features this breakdown is quite representative for the world fleet share of ship types fig 5 shows important main particulars and coefficients of the ships in the database the ship length between perpendiculars lpp ranges between 90 m and 383 m with several datasets in model scale only the block coefficient cb of the containerships ranges roughly from 0 55 to 0 65 while for tankers and bulk carriers from 0 75 to 0 85 the majority of ship length to beam ratios l b range from slightly over 5 to slightly over 7 5 the beam to draft ratios b t range from roughly 2 5 to 4 5 in design condition and in ballast condition this value increases significantly these ratios are in the common range of systematically analysed ship data papanikolaou 2014 the froude number fr spreads from 0 0 to approximately 0 30 this wide spreading is because the prediction method was initially developed to support the assessment of minimum power in adverse weather condition which is typically a low speed problem regarding the wave heading most of the test cases were for head waves 180 degree only for off head bow waves 21 sets of data were collected while for following astern waves 11 datasets were available 4 some improvements of the earlier formula for head waves 4 1 influence of slenderness on the added resistance following the study of jinkine and ferdinande 1974 the value of ωmax where the maximum added resistance is observed depends solely upon the froude number fr and the nondimensional radius of gyration of pitch kyy but not on the ship s hull form this conclusion was based on the examination of added resistance data for the few fast cargo ships with cb in between 0 564 and 0 653 and b t in between 2 4 and 2 72 in an earlier study by the present authors liu and papanikolaou 2019 cb was introduced in the prediction of ω m a x but this was only used together with b t for capturing the effect of draft examining the added resistance of two series 60 ships with block coefficients cb 0 65 and 0 80 at two speeds using the far field method liu et al 2011 it proved that the full hull forms tend to have their peak added resistance due to vertical plane motion resonance at higher non dimensional wavelengths than the fine hull forms namely towards longer waves as shown in fig 6 this observation is also confirmed by the collected experimental data from various sources at similar speeds the shown experimental results in blue which are the added resistance of fine ships have their maximum values at lower non dimensional wavelengths than the maximum values of the experimental results in red which are the added resistance of full ships at similar speed this graph illustrates the influence of hull form particularly of block coefficient on the peak of the added resistance following this preliminary observation a more extensive study was conducted two groups of added resistance data were collected for ships with cb 0 55 0 65 and cb 0 80 0 85 respectively the location of maximum added resistance i e the corresponding λ lpp value is plotted versus froude number fig 7 shows the obtained results clearly the green squares are below the blue circles which is essentially the same as what has been observed in fig 6 the green curve is the predicted location of maximum added resistance for a ship with cb 0 60 following the original prediction formula though the predicted values are higher than the observations from experimental results considering that originally the results were plotted iwith respect to frequency this deviation should have been expected therefore it is advisable to introduce a cb based parameter when predicting the location of the maximum added resistance for a ship as shown by the blue curve in the graph 4 2 character of added resistance in ballast condition it was noted in previous studies of the authors that the features of added resistance of the kvlcc2 model in ballast condition are different from that of added resistance in full load condition with the dimensionless added resistance in short waves tending to be higher while the maximum added resistance is observed at shorter wave lengths to account for this the beam to draft ratio b t and trim angle were introduced to extend the formula to the ballast condition scenario we worked out first the influence of the reduced draft then examined the difference in added resistance between the trimmed ballast condition and the even keel condition with the same mean draft as in ballast condition and attributed the difference to the influence of the trim this methodology has been elaborated in previously published work liu and papanikolaou 2019 after setting up the new database more experimental data of the added resistance of ships in ballast condition could be collected as shown in fig 8 overall the shape of the curves of the non dimensional added resistance in head waves and in ballast condition resembles each other very much which confirmes the specific feature of added resistance in ballast condition the trim factor is then tuned according to the new experimental database 5 new formula for added resistance in waves of arbitrary heading 5 1 added resistance due to diffraction effect in waves of arbitrary headings according to faltinsen et al s method 1980 the added resistance in short waves is calculated as 1 r a w r c f e sin θ d l where the acting steady quasi second order pressure force per unit length of the waterline f e is 2 f e 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ α 2 ω 0 u g 1 cos θ cos θ a and the integration is reduced to the non shadowed area of the waterline fig 9 shows the definition of the incident wave angle α and the waterline segment inclination angle θ in following waves the formula is reduced to 3 f e 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ 2 ω 0 u g 1 cos 2 θ which means the force elements are always in positive direction because in following waves only the stern is exposed to the incident waves the sine value of the astern waterline elements is always negative thus the integration outcome is always negative which means an additional wave induced thrust force however this may be valid only for zero or small forward speed whereas viscous effects need also to be considered when the ship speed is high this 2nd order drift force effect will have in general a positive added resistance value revisiting faltinsen et al s formula and assuming the steady fluid velocity vu cosθ where u is the ship s speed we may obtain the following expression 4 f e f e u 0 f e δ u 1 4 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ α sin θ α sin θ α 2 ω 0 u sin θ sin θ α g 2 ω 0 u sin θ sin 2 θ α g sin θ α if sin θ α 0 which indicates the non shadowed part of the waterline 5 f e 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ α 2 ω 0 u sin θ sin θ α g 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ α 2 ω 0 u g cos α cos θ cos θ α this is in accordance to what sakamoto and baba 1986 have derived if sin θ α 0 which indicates the shadowed part of the waterline 6 f e 0 in following waves the formula is reduced to 7 f e 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ 2 ω 0 u g 1 cos 2 θ 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ 1 2 ω 0 u g from the above expression it is understood that for high speed or low frequency the force element will have a negative value hence the integration will become positive which means a resistance this is easily understood when considering the transom stern with sin θ 1 if we set the force to be zero namely 8 f e 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 sin 2 θ 1 2 ω 0 u g 0 2 ω 0 u g 1 u g 2 ω 0 v c 2 v g when the ship speed is half of the incident wave s propagating speed phase velocity vc or equal to the incident wave s group velocity vg the mean force will be zero this is consistent with the fact that the wave energy is propagated at group velocity though the wave still overtakes the ship for ships with simple smooth waterline shape at the stern for cruiser type sterns we may apply the same concept as for head waves namely introducing a length of run lr as defined in fig 10 to approximate the bluntness coefficient for following waves then the added resistance due to the diffraction effect can be approximated as 9 r a w r 2 25 2 ρ g b α t ζ a 2 sin 2 e 2 α 2 ω 0 u g cos α cos e 2 cos e 2 α it is noted that the form factor 0 87 c b 1 4 f n which accounts for the complicated hydrodynamic phenomena induced by the sharp corner at the bow liu et al 2015 is neglected in the following wave case this is because in general the astern hull form is comparably smooth to ensure a favorable flow to the propellerdisk modern ship types however often feature extreme transom stern waterline forms for instance extended overhanging transom stern hence it is necessary to use more segments to properly represent the waterline profile when high accuracy is required 5 2 the influence of ship s draft on added resistance due to diffraction effect following the concept of calculating the added resistance of a restrained hull of draft t which advances in head waves from the integral of the pressure acting on the vertical projection of the hull surface ogiwara et al 1996 derived an expression to include the draft effect as follows 10 r a w r 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b 1 e 2 k t 2 ω 0 u g b f where the bluntness coefficient is defined as 11 b f 2 b 0 b 2 sin 2 θ d y in our formula liu et al 2016 we followed kwon s reasoning on the draft effect 1981 and adopted the draft factor smith effect of 12 α t 1 e 2 k t substituting this coefficient into the asymptotic formula will yield 13 r awr 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b 1 e 2 kt 1 2 ω v g b f 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b 1 e 2 kt 2 ω v g 2 ω ve 2 kt g b f the difference of this expression from that of ogiwara et al 1996 is the inclusion of the last higher order term in the parentheses from eq 13 it is also clear that the nondimensional added resistance r a w ρ g ζ α 2 b 2 l p p in very short waves at zero speed approaches to a constant value while at nonzero speed goes to infinite it should be noted that ζ α of infinitesimal waves is also infinitesimal thus the absolute added resistance in very short waves is still zero as the wave steepness is of finite value as pointed out by liu and papanikolaou 2017 nevertheless the local draft at stern is sometimes very small hence significantly affects the diffraction effect this effect calls for more detailed studies 5 3 added resistance due to radiation effect in following waves consider an aft fore symmetric ship since the existing formula is able to yield a prediction of the added resistance in head waves at zero speed then the following waves case can also be predicted in that case in following waves at zero speed it is understood that the added resistance or drift force has a negative value pushing the ship 14 r awm 4 ρ g ζ a 2 b 2 l p p a 1 a 2 ω b 1 e b 1 d 1 1 ω d 1 where ω 2 142 k y y 3 l p p λ 1 0 111 c b

2 66 f o r ω 1 566 l p p b 2 66 e l s e w h e r e fig 11 shows the added resistance of a bulk carrier in following waves at zero speed predicted by this formula how will the added resistance change as a ship speeds up in following waves let us consider an extreme case namely a ship sailing at very high speed in following waves in such a situation as the ship travels faster than the wave the ship will feel an added resistance namely a force opposite to the direction it sails obviously as the speed increases from zero the added resistance changes gradually from negative to positive we further analyze this phenomenon assuming deep water condition in following waves when ship s speed u equals the wave s celerity phase velocity vc u vc g λ 2 π the ship will travel with the wave while the incident wave profile retains the same relative position with the ship and interacts with ship s steady wave profile however as pointed out before from energy point of view the incident wave energy is traveling with the wave group velocity at vc 2 and some energy exchange will take place between the ship and wave which will induce oscillatory motions in order to see under what condition the added resistance becomes zero which is a complex phenomenon we explore our experimental database fig 12 shows the experimental results for the added resistance of several ships in following waves starting from zero speed to moderate speed scrutinizing these data it is noted that the maximum added resistance approaches zero when uvc 4 as plotted in fig 13 thus let us assume that the turning point for the change of the maxima of added resistance in following waves is when u vc 4 recalling that at zero speed the wave is pushing the ship we may state that the ship consumes some energy when its speed exceeds vc 4 thus experiences some added resistance assuming a linear relationship with ship speed the added resistance exerting on the ship when sailing with vc 2 will be similar to that of the case when the ship is excited by a head wave of the same length at zero speed since we herein assumed that the ship is fore aft symmetric when u vc 2 in following waves this case can be considered the same as a ship traveling at a speed of u vc 2 in head waves thus re examining the results of fig 13 we conclude 1 on the x axis corresponding to fr 0 the original formula is applied and the added resistance is negative thus a pushing force added thrust 2 on the curve u vc 4 the added resistance due to radiation effect is zero 3 on the curve u vc 2 the added resistance due to radiation effect equals to the added resistance of the ship at zero speed in head waves 4 the maximum value of added resistance at any condition between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3 can be approximated by linear interpolation 5 added resistance at any condition above the u vc 2 curve can be approximated by applying the original formula using a relative froude number of u vc 2 g l 5 4 added resistance due to radiation effect in waves of various headings by now we have found a solution for the added resistance due to radiation effect in head waves and following waves the next task is to work out the added resistance due to radiation effect in waves of arbitrary heading for the concerned empirical formula it is important to identify the location wave period length where the maximum nondimensional added resistance is observed as well as this maximum value for this reason several sets of data including the added resistance of a bulk carrier at fr 0 0 and 0 1 the added resistance of a second bulk carrier at fr 0 128 and the added resistance of s175 ship at fr 0 15 and 0 25 have been examined to sort out the values of interest figs 14 and 15 show the location of raw max and the values of raw max a1a2 as a function of wave heading α of various ships at various speeds it is observed that these values can be fairly well approximated by introducing some wave heading based trigonometric functions by exploiting the newly gained knowledge it is possible to make a prediction of the added resistance of ships of different types at various speeds in waves of any heading the quadratic transfer functions of added resistance in regular head to following waves r a w can be calculated as the sum of r awm the component of added resistance due to motion radiation effect and r awr the component of added resistance due to reflection diffraction effect in regular waves 15 r aw r awm r awr the expression of r awm is given as follows 16 r awm 4 ρ g ζ a 2 b 2 l p p a 1 a 2 a 3 ω b 1 e b

zero speed in comparison with experimental results fig 18 shows the obtained results of the added resistance of the s175 ship at moderate speed in comparison with experimental results fujii and takahashi 1975 qualitatively a reasonable prediction accuracy has been demonstrated it is also noted that the added resistance asymptotically approaches zero value when the wavelength to ship length ratio λ l becomes larger or tends to infinity this can be deduced from potential flow theory reasoning both the motion radiation and diffraction effects goes to zero but in reality there are still some viscosity effects present that lead to non zero values as evidenced by tank test results and verified by cfd simulations see e g el moctar et al 2017 6 preliminary error analysis of estimated added resistance in regular waves of arbitrary heading the available experimental data is herein used as the yardstick for the assessment of the performance of the developed empirical formula several parameters are used to assess the quality of the prediction the mean percentage error and the absolute percentage error are defined as follows ε m e a n 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i y i ε a b s 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i y i where y i is the experimental value and y ˆ i is the predicted value using the formula the pearson s r correlation coefficient is defined as follows r n y y ˆ i y y ˆ i n y 2 y 2 n y ˆ i 2 y ˆ i 2 the standard deviation σ of the differences between predicted values and experimental values is calculated as σ 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 the mean absolute error mae which is the average of the absolute difference between the predicted values and experimental values is calculated as m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i table 3 shows the main particulars of twenty ships of various types and sizes that are used in assessing the prediction of added resistance in waves of various headings in both laden and ballast conditions from zero speed to design speed fig 19 shows the predicted added resistance of eight full type ships in design or laden condition in regular head waves at design speed in comparison with corresponding experimental results the errors of predictions are very low with εmean 1 3 while εabs 14 7 the correlation coefficient r 0 956 σ 0 624 and mae 0 499 the 20 difference line is also presented for reference purpose overall the prediction is satisfactory fig 20 shows the predicted added resistance of six full type ships in ballast condition in regular head waves at design speed in comparison with the experimental results the obtained εmean 21 9 εabs 26 2 r 0 948 σ 0 777 mae 0 657 this calculated error is herein larger than in the case of full type ships in design condition this is partly due to the observed underprediction in short waves as shown in the graph it is noted that the majority of the herein used experimental data is from tested models of small ship length namely 2 9 m for cases where larger models were used an overestimation has been observed this indicates that the uncertainty of the accumulated experimental data is significant and the formula should be further tuned upon the availability of additional data particularly data with greater accuracy and higher reliability fig 21 shows the correlation of the predicted added resistance of seven fast cargo ships of lengths 175 m 351 m in laden or ballast condition in regular head waves at moderate speeds fr 0 183 0 3 with the experimental results the correlation has a lower value than in the previous cases 0 918 which is readily visible from the scattering of the data a large deviation was here observed with σ 1 37 mae 0 999 this might be due to larger uncertainties associated with the higher test speeds the obtained errors are εmean 1 6 and εabs 22 6 fig 22 shows the predicted added resistance of six ships of lengths 175 m 383 m in laden or ballast conditions in regular waves of random headings at moderate speeds fr 0 183 0 3 in comparison with the experimental results the obtained correlation coefficient r standard deviation σ mae εmean and εabs values for each case are presented in table 4 from the obtained statistics the performance in bow waves is as good as the performance in head waves for waves propagating in transverse direction with 60 o α 120 o much less data is available for cases with forward speed due to the restriction of the experimental set up the obtained σ and mae are slightly larger than those in bow waves however because the added resistance in this region is smaller than in bow waves the relative error becomes rather large εabs 42 2 in oblique stern waves with 0 o α 60 o the added resistance is much smaller than that in bow waves in addition due to the doppler effect the frequency of encounter reduces very fast thus making the measurement more challenging both factors make the measurements vulnerable to large uncertainties thus giving a rather low correlation r 0 684 note that the achieved σ 0 614 and mae 0 459 are even smaller than in other headings however the relative error is large εabs 76 4 at present state of knowledge it cannot be expected that the performance of numerical prediction methods in this heading region can be improved without working on the establishment of a solid experimental database to verify and to fine tune numerical predictions nevertheless due to its relatively small contribution to the mean added resistance when considering directional seaways this error is less important from a practical viewpoint fig 23 shows the predicted added resistance of four ships of lengths 178 m 355 m in laden conditions in regular waves of arbitrary headings at low speeds fr 0 06 in comparison with the experimental results the obtained correlation coefficient r standard deviation σ mae εmean and εabs values for each case are presented in table 5 this is a special case that is strongly related to presently heated discussions about the minimum required power to maintain manoeuvrability in adverse conditions for bow waves with 120 o α 180 o the obtained εmean 3 0 and εabs 33 1 which indicates that the predictions scatter is well around the experimental results for beam waves with 60 o α 120 o less data are available for cases with forward speed due to the restriction of the experimental set up the obtained σ and mae are in the same range as those in bow waves however because the added resistance in this region is smaller than in bow waves the relative error becomes larger with εmean 19 4 and εabs 38 7 in stern waves with 0 o α 60 o though the achieved σ 0 518 and mae 0 414 are smaller than in other headings as the added resistance is much smaller than that in bow waves the obtained correlation coefficient is rather low r 0 583 and the relative error is εmean 10 5 and εabs 52 6 considering the overall good performance of the formula at moderate speeds the decreased performance at low speeds might be credited to various reasons first the tank tests results tend to be more uncertain as discussed earlier tank wall effects at low speed are also more significant at low speed as shown by yuan et al 2018 secondly the experimental data are rather limited thus the associated uncertainties are large thirdly as discussed by duan and li 2013 the influence of speed on added resistance due to diffraction effect is actually nonlinear whereas in the present formula we apply a linear model more investigations both experimental and analytical need to be conducted before concluding among others we are working on the analysis of data using artificial neural networks anns as demonstrated very recently in this subject area by cepowski 2020 7 summary and conclusions in this paper we first reviewed systematically various public domain experimental studies on the added resistance of ships in waves and established a unique database which was enriched by additional data from joint industry projects of ntua ship design laboratory registered ships in the database are within the range of 80 m l pp 380 m 5 0 l b 7 5 2 0 b t 8 0 0 54 c b 0 87 0 0 fr 0 3 which is representative for the global merchant cargo ship fleet the database includes data of ships in both ballast and full load conditions at various speeds and in waves of arbitrary headings the set up experimental database which includes more than 3 000 data points for 130 ships of various types and sizes has been exploited to formulate an empirical method for the estimation of the added resistance in waves and of associated added powering as necessary for the practical use in ship design and assessment of ship operation experimental data for the ballast condition were also examined and helped to calibrate related parameters on this basis we refined an earlier version of the empirical formula of the authors for the added resistance which should be now applicable to waves of any heading and cargo ships of various types in full load and ballast condition several correction factors were examined to more accurately consider the ship s draft effect the hull form influence etc for short waves we improved the empirical formula for the added resistance based on faltinsen et al s asymptotic approach by introducing two empirical parameters namely the length of entrance le and length of run lr of ship s waterline for long waves we improved the empirical formula of jinkine and ferdinande 1974 by introducing hull form parameters such as cb b t kyy and trim etc for the trickier case of following waves we tackled the problem by applying first principles namely investigating the energy exchange between the ship and incidental wave wherever there is a shortage of insight due to complexity we used experimental results to test our assumptions we also extended the formula to beam waves heuristically following classical seakeeping theory deliberations for stern oblique waves a linear interpolation between beam and following waves was applied considering that the concerned added resistance quantity is relatively small on this basis our proposed empirical formula that covers the added resistance of merchant ships in full load and ballast condition operatingin waves of arbitrary heading was derived the developed formula was applied to several typical types of ships including bulk carriers tankers containerships etc in both full load and ballast conditions from very low speed to design speed in waves of arbitrary heading the results are compared with experimental data from the public domain that can be independently verified an error analysis shows that a promising agreement has been obtained the proposed empirical formula uses very simple input and algebraic expressions that can be readily programmed on a pocket calculator and enables the transparent and satisfactory estimation of the added resistance of ships in waves this facilitates the wider application of the formula by the industry particularly where the detailed hull form and advanced software tools are not available the proposed formula may be also used for speed corrections in sea trials the minimum power assessment in the frame of recent eedi regulations fuel performance

21871,immersed tunnels are built on the seabed which is washed and unloaded by seawater resulting in a thinner covering layer when compared to drilling blast tunnels if the overburden layer is too thin it increases the tunnel s buoyancy and the shear stress of the joints if the overburden layer is too thick the external pressure increases and reducing structural stability to limit the impacts of stress instability and costs the buried depth of a tunnel is an important variable in this study a calculation of the reasonable buried depth for an immersed tunnel is presented using the delphi method and fuzzy set theory the weights associated with an engineering analogy foundation settlement structural internal force and seismic load methods each method were obtained for a set of proposed buried depths these weights were used to construct an optimization calculation model for optimal buried depth which was then applied to the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel based on the model results a buried depth of 14 25 m was selected the results provide a reference point and guide for future research on calculating a reasonable depth for immersed tunnels keywords delphi method fuzzy set theory immersed tunnel optimum design calculation reasonable buried depth 1 introduction as economic growth and development becomes more widespread efficient mass transportation systems gain importance often waterways create natural chasms separating all types of landmasses making land travel inconvenient subsea tunnels could provide traffic routes for vehicles and pedestrians crossing straits and estuaries ferle and stekovic 2014 typically underwater tunnels are constructed using one of these methods drilling and blasting shielding or tube immersion hong 2017 liu and yuan 2015 rasmussen 1997 the construction of an immersed tunnel is a complicated process first prefabricated pipe sections are transported to the area where the tunnel is being built next the pipes are lowered to the evacuated foundation groove and butted in sequence forming the undersea channel lastly the soil is backfilled gokce et al 2009 the buried depth of an immersed tunnel is then obtained using the thickness of the backfill plus the depth of seawater as shown in fig 1 the immersed tunnel for this study was built on the seabed the thickness of the overburden is extremely important if too thin the buoyancy of the tunnel and the shear stress of joints would increase if too thick external pressure would increase causing structural instability therefore to limit the impacts of these variables it is important to accurately determine the reasonable buried depth of the tunnel to determine the reasonable buried depth for a subsea tunnel the borehole blasting and shielding methods have been studied with similar engineering conditions the engineering analogy method was reliable but conservative as shown in the norwegian subsea tunnel construction nilsen 1993 japanese minimum leakage method kitamura 1986 miyaguchi 1986 and chinese experiences from mining using the waterbody method sun et al 1999 liu 2003 li et al 2007 studied the buried depth of the subsea tunnel using engineering analogy and numerical analysis methods the sea depth overlying rock thickness and permeability coefficient were investigated through numerical examples by cheng et al 2017 xue et al 2019 established a model using a hybrid intelligent system to predict the overlying rock thickness of a subsea tunnel the above research results provide a good foundation to study the reasonable buried depth for a submerged tunnel to provide a guide for designers grant 2001a b summarized the settlement statistics and calculation methods for a completed immersed tunnel ding et al 2006 established a large scale seismic response calculation model to study immersed tunnels under seismic loading and reveal design weaknesses kasper et al 2008 studied the stability of an immersed tunnel under wave impact using a combination of physical model tests and numerical model simulations the effects of tunnel net buoyancy and tunnel length on the dynamic responses of a submerged floating tunnel under hydrodynamic loads were investigated by long et al 2009 li et al 2014 used physical model tests to evaluate sand deposit expansion and the location in the foundation trench of the immersed tunnel the dynamic characteristics of an immersed tunnel were studied by lee et al 2016 showing fluid compressibility seawater depth tunnel structure location in the water and how energy absorption influenced seismic responses wu et al 2016 investigated the stresses and deformations of the excavation foundation pit in the immersed tunnel chen et al 2018 established a new conceptual pore pressure buildup model to study the wave induced residual liquefaction around the tunnel due to pore pressure accumulation under cyclic shearing he et al 2018 stated that the sand compaction pile method in an immersed tunnel is a robust solution to limit the total and differential longitudinal settlement wang et al 2019 conducted a series of shaking table tests to investigate the characteristics of seismic waves and how it affected the response of immersed tunnel segments these previous studies provide a good foundation for the research of immersed tunnel reasonable buried depth and focus on the immersed tunnel stability and structure however there is no uniform standard or computing method to determine the buried depth of an immersed tunnel immersed tunnels were first built more than 100 years ago providing significant engineering experience for reference to use the engineering analogy method to determine the buried depth typical immersed tunnels are investigated and included in the analogy item then compared with the actual working conditions of the immersed tunnel being designed other methods that are commonly used to determine the buried depth of an immersed tunnel include but are not limited to the following methods foundation settlement structural internal force and seismic load however few single studies have considered multiple influencing factors when determining the buried depth and cannot fully guide the construction of the immersed tunnel therefore it is necessary to determine the buried depth according to the characteristics of each method the delphi method rates each method by a set of experts and obtains the evaluation language of each method in determining the buried depth of an immersed tunnel the fuzzy set theory can reasonably quantify the fuzzy phenomena and related statements from the delphi method in this study we comprehensively considered four methods included engineering analogy method foundation settlement method structural internal force method and seismic load method which were used to calculate buried depths furthermore using the delphi method and fuzzy set theory we obtained the weights associated with each method for a set of proposed buried depths finally an optimization calculation model was built by introducing these weights to calculate the optimal buried depth for a specific submerged tube tunnel namely the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel flowchart of calculation method for the reasonable buried depth is shown in fig 2 2 methodology 2 1 delphi method the delphi method is a group decision making behavior that uses anonymous and sequential consultation to understand complex tasks the expertise experience and subjective judgment of many experts form the basis of this method okoli and pawlowski 2004 brady 2015 when evaluating a project the delphi method is especially suitable for analysis and prediction if pertinent information and historical data are unavailable it can incorporate multiple interactions with experts and converges the scattered opinions into coordinated results the delphi method follows a series of steps 1 identify evaluation goals once the design team clearly defines the objective of effectiveness with the help of logical thinking and expertise the participants generate results through the evaluation of the objective 2 choose the experts to provide beneficial opinions and value judgments experts should have a high degree of authority unique insights rich experience and theoretical understanding of the subject 3 design and distribute the comment consulting table the table should be clear at a glance and conform to the understanding and cognitive abilities of the experts so that they are able to answer truthfully 4 assess the problem the experts should anonymously conduct the evaluation and answer the questions according to the evaluation rules 5 process data the integrated optimization model of expert opinions is established by the original opinions of experts the optimal or satisfactory solution is found by comprehensively considering the consistency and coordination factors 2 2 fuzzy set theory fuzzy set theory is a method that represents ambiguous concepts and establishes appropriate membership functions the fuzzy object is analyzed through the operation and transformation of the fuzzy set there is a mapping on the domain u i e a u 0 1 u u a u 0 1 where a is the fuzzy set on u and u a u is the membership of u to a 1 a λ u μ a u λ u u 0 λ 1 where a λ is the cut set of a to λ if a mapping can be defined as f x y the fuzzy mapping f from f x to f y can be induced by f 2 a f a 3 f a y f x y a x f 1 y 0 f 1 y similarly the fuzzy mapping f 1 from f x to f y can be induced by f 4 f 1 f y f x 5 b f 1 b 6 f 1 b x b f x the fuzzy set can reasonably quantify the fuzzy phenomena and related sentences from the delphi method in this study the natural sentences of very low low medium large and very large were adopted to influence the factors affecting the buried depth of the immersed tunnel in addition the triangular fuzzy function method was selected to calculate and describe expert evaluation the triangle fuzzy function was expressed as a f a b c and its membership function was eq 7 7 f x 0 x a x a b a a x b x b c b b x c 1 x c the fuzzy numbers form and cut set are shown in table 1 in the evaluation each response must be comprehensively considered as the opinions of experts may vary here we used the arithmetic mean to make a comprehensive evaluation 8 x i f 1 f 2 f 3 f n n where x i was the fuzzy number of occurrences f i 1 j n representing the evaluation fuzzy value of event i by the jth expert and n stands for the number of events according to the extension theory of fuzzy set x i was also a fuzzy set setting w i λ z 1 z 2 a λ b c λ d we could solve for λ z 1 b a and λ z 2 d c the relation function expression of the average fuzzy function is given in eq 9 9 f w i z z b a b z a b 1 a b z c d z d c c d z d 0 else to obtain a quantitative value the method of solving ambiguity to analyze the probability of an event is often used defuzzification refers to the process of finding a single value that best reflects the fuzzy set to be solved the ambiguity can be solved by many methods integral value center of gravity weighted average etc for a comprehensive comparison of various factors the integral method was used to solve the fuzzy set this method was chosen because it can be easily applied and can reduce computational burden the expression is shown in eq 10 10 i α μ r a 1 α μ l a where i is the fuzzy solution value α α 0 1 is the control coefficient μ r a represents the integral of the right membership inverse function μ l a stands for the integral of the left membership inverse function for fuzzy trigonometric functions the cut set of μ r a and μ l a can be expressed by eqs 11 and 12 11 μ r a 1 2 λ 0 1 1 n λ λ λ 0 0 9 n λ λ 12 μ l a 1 2 λ 0 1 1 m λ λ λ 0 0 9 m λ λ where n λ is upper limit of fuzzy number a in cut set λ m λ is lower limit of fuzzy number a in cut set λ λ 0 0 1 0 2 1 λ 0 1 finally the weights can be obtained according to the probability of influencing factors by data normalization 3 engineering background known as the project of the century and spanning an expansive cross sea channel the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge is a system of artificial islands cable stayed bridges and an undersea tunnel the immersed tunnel is part of the 35 km highway connecting hong kong zhuhai and macao the landform of the project can be divided into three parts the western hilly region eastern hilly region and central lingdingyang waters the immersed tunnel section is located in the middle of the line which pertains to the lingdingyang waters the geomorphology is simple showing the plain shape of marine deposits the seafloor terrain is relatively flat and the elevation of the mud surface graduates from 7 0 to 12 0 m as shown in the regional survey fig 3 from top to bottom the strata range between mire clay and sand hu et al 2015 in this area there are two types of groundwater porous confined and fissure the pore confined water of loose rocks occurs in the sand layer the soil layer that overlies the sand layer is composed of weak water bearing and water permeable cohesive soil the locally developed sand layer distributes discontinuously amid poor groundwater recharge fracture water consists of weathered fracture water and structural fracture water in the metamorphic rocks it communicates well with the overlying sand layer and constitutes a direct hydraulic connection 4 application of the reasonable buried depth calculation 4 1 calculation method analysis the methods for calculating the reasonable buried depth for an immersed tunnel are numerous and complex because it was difficult to evaluate specific calculation methods we selected several proven ones to determine a reasonable buried depth in this study according to the geological survey data for the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel four methods were used engineering analogy foundation settlement structural internal force and seismic load 1 engineering analogy method a1 engineering analogy is widely used during the design stage when starting a new project designers would naturally consider previous similar projects immersed tunnels were first built more than 100 years ago providing significant experience for reference to use the engineering analogy method in determining the buried depth we investigated a typical immersed tunnel including it in the analogy item and comparing it with the working conditions of the project of interest 2 foundation settlement method a2 many factors influenced the settlement of the immersed tunnel it was mainly caused by the compression deformation of the base layer the tunnel was immersed in an underwater environment contending with a thick soft soil foundation weak mechanical properties and low bearing capacity for the immersed tunnel a deeper depth affected the stability of the tunnel structure 3 structural internal force method a3 during the construction process of the structural internal force analysis method designers fully considered the dynamic effect of structural stress and dynamic change and derived the stress state of the structure the depth of the buried tunnel affected the stress of its structure and the designed life cycle of the pipe sections 4 seismic load method a4 as the immersed tunnel was built on the seabed and buried at a shallow depth the dynamic interaction between the tunnel and soil could not be ignored the soft soil under the tunnel was a porous multiphase medium which produced large deformations resulting in an uneven settlement of the subsea tunnel under the seismic load method special attention was given to the foundation soil stability water and structure coupling and anti floating capacity 4 2 wt calculation to develop a model that reasonably calculates the buried depth of an immersed tunnel the weights of different methods were analyzed after the four methods described above were selected and a model evaluation sample was constructed by the delphi method the weights were calculated using fuzzy set theory five experts from different departments e g academia private construction and design firm participated in the assessment of the calculation method of immersed tunnel buried depth these experts were independent in their evaluation reducing information asymmetry the evaluation language of each individual is shown in table 2 we used the engineering analogy method as an example to calculate the fuzzy number using eqs 8 12 x i f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 5 1 5 0 1 λ 0 0 1 λ 0 2 0 1 λ 0 0 1 λ 0 0 1 λ 0 2 0 1 λ 0 3 0 1 λ 0 5 0 1 λ 0 3 0 1 λ 0 3 0 1 λ 0 5 0 1 λ 0 08 0 1 λ 0 26 μ l a 1 1 2 λ 0 1 1 n λ λ λ 0 0 9 n λ λ 0 13 μ r a 1 1 2 λ 0 1 1 n λ λ λ 0 0 9 n λ λ 0 43 according to eq 10 and taking α 0 5 i 1 α μ r a 1 1 α μ l a 1 0 28 the calculation of the fuzzy numbers is shown in table 3 the weights of each method were also calculated as shown in fig 4 the weight of engineering analogy was 0 13 foundation settlement was 0 34 structural internal force was 0 30 and seismic load is 0 23 4 3 buried depth calculation as the research topic for this study we selected a section of the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel located at k10 563 1 engineering analogy in the case of different subsea tunnels the empirical formulas show that the buried depth is related to seawater depth nilsen 1993 seawater depth affects head pressure a higher the sea depth means a higher overlying rock thickness is needed to balance the head pressure the engineering analogy method is used to determine by comparing projects with similar engineering parameters in this study engineering information of typical immersed tunnels was collected from around the world to analyze the correlation between seawater depth and buried depth table 4 as shown in fig 5 by analyzing the engineering data of different immersed tunnels we derived an empirical equation for buried depth as a function of sea depth 13 h b 0 75 h s 0 69 where h b is the buried depth of immersed tunnel and h s is seawater depth the seawater depth is 17 m at k10 563 so following eq 13 the calculated buried depth of this section is 13 44 m 2 foundation settlement to study the foundation settlement of the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel flac3d software was used to establish a numerical model based on geological data as shown in fig 6 we used various buried depths to adjust the numerical model and calculate the foundation settlement for our numerical simulation using the model the following assumptions were made the rock mass was an equivalent continuous model of homogeneous and isotropic media the initial stress of rock mass only considered the influence of gravity stress tectonic stress was not considered in the model an element with equivalent water pressure is established above the tunnel backfill to simulate the seawater the rock mass deformation was assumed to be governed by the mohr coulomb criterion based on the elastic plastic constitutive model the sand cushion sinking pipe and backfill were assumed as elastic structures the materials such as backfill clay metalling tunnel and sand were defined respectively table 5 and then the numerical model grid was meshed furthermore a horizontal boundary constraint is applied to the left and right sides of the domain the domain is also constrained vertically at the bottom boundary the whole construction stage was simulated by activating the grid and modifying the corresponding unit attributes before simulating excavation the soil gravity stress is regarded as the initial stress field during the definition of construction stage the foundation groove was firstly excavated along the y axis meanwhile the sand and stone cushion was laid at the bottom then the sinking pipe was lowered and finally the backfill was completed this numerical model configuration was used to investigate the foundation settlement at buried depths of 10 15 and 20 m as shown in fig 7 the foundation settlement increased as the buried depth decreased ranging from 118 mm at 20 m 96 mm at 15 m and 67 mm at 10 m during the immersed tunnel construction the foundation settlement mainly consists of two parts the initial subsidence caused by excavation disturbance and the settlement caused by the initial compression of the overlying load of the pipe section excessive settlement will cause structural cracking which will affect the safety of the immersed tunnel wei et al 2013 found that 90 9 of foundation settlement occurred within 100 mm by analyzing 164 sets of field monitoring data therefore a foundation settlement of 100 mm is considered a safety margin based on the numerical calculation results only the buried depths of 15 and 10 m meet this safety requirement given that in general numerical results tend to be lower than actual engineering results due to the assumptions and simplified model formulations the 96 mm settlement at 15 m buried depth was too close to the safety threshold and therefore deemed unfit consequently a buried depth of 10 m was selected for the foundation settlement method 3 structural internal force the same numerical model and configuration was used to investigate the structural internal force at the same buried depths as in the previous section i e 10 15 and 20 m the maximum principal stress at a buried depth of 20 m was 1 90 mpa 1 80 mpa at 15 m and 1 75 mpa at 10 m fig 8 the range of values in maximum principal stress was relatively close with the main area of stress concentration located at the junction of the bottom plate and sidewall when the buried depth of the tunnel was 15 m the affected area was small so this buried depth was selected for the structural internal force method 4 seismic load because research on the seismic response of immersed tunnels is relatively new in the region of interest there is neither a systematic analysis method nor a special seismic standard li 2013 selected a set of buried depths 0 10 and 20 m to establish a model and study the influence of various buried depths on the seismic response of the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel fig 9 the results showed that the seismic response of the immersed tunnel decreases as the buried depth increases following this information a buried depth of 20 m was selected for the seismic load method 4 4 optimal computation four methods included engineering analogy method foundation settlement method structural internal force method and seismic load method were used the values calculated by each method were different we weighted the calculation results for each method to obtain the reasonable buried depth of the immersed tunnel table 6 finally the buried depth of 14 25 m was selected 5 discussion the actual buried depth of this section of the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel is 16 74 m here a buried depth of 14 25 m was selected by comprehensive consideration based on the numerical simulation model of immersed tunnel established in this study the buried depth is adjusted to verify the applicability from structural stress and ground subsidence the results show that the basement deformation is less than 100 mm and the structure stress is relatively uniform the comparison of actual and calculated values indicates that the buried depth of the immersed tunnel determined on site was conservative with the development of subsea tunnel construction technology it is reasonable to suggest that the buried depth of an immersed tunnel can be reduced to increase the accuracy of calculation more data on immersed tunnels were collected using the engineering analogy method for future research by sharing resources substantial data processing and multidisciplinary cooperation more comprehensive and reliable data can be used to calculate buried depth the bottom of the immersed tunnel analyzed in this study was located in the sand and the recompression deformation of the sand layer was the main cause of subsidence the numerical calculation model performed did not consider the change of sedimentation with time and ignored the main consolidation settlement secondary consolidation settlement instantaneous settlement and seabed silt deposition the numerical simulations produced results that were smaller than the actual value the displacement change at the top of the immersed tunnel was also smaller than that at the bottom we believe that the protective layer of block stone around the sunken tube generally forms a supporting effect like an arch supporting the upper backfill silt layer it was also found that the maximum principal stress of the immersed tunnel was mainly distributed at the junction of the bottom plate and sidewall here it was subjected to pressure from the horizontal and vertical directions and it was in a state of three phase stress resulting in the maximum compressive stress concentration in the process of making the sunken pipe in the stress concentration area it is necessary to strengthen the reinforcement and shear key installation to meet the requirements of tensile and bending resistance to prevent cracks under pressure in the sunken pipe and to prevent seepage at the outer wall 6 conclusions an optimum design calculation method for the reasonable buried depth was established consisting of engineering analogy foundation settlement structural internal force and seismic load 1 the buried depth of the immersed tunnel was influenced by many factors with complicated and uncertain characteristics in this study the weights of each buried depth calculation method were obtained based on the delphi method and fuzzy set theory the weights for the engineering analogy the foundation settlement the structural internal force and the seismic load methods were 0 13 0 34 0 30 and 0 23 respectively 2 the optimization calculation model was applied to the immersed tunnel in the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge finally the buried depth of 14 25 m was selected by comprehensive consideration the research results provide a reference and guide for future research on calculating the buried depth of the immersed tunnel credit authorship

21871,immersed tunnels are built on the seabed which is washed and unloaded by seawater resulting in a thinner covering layer when compared to drilling blast tunnels if the overburden layer is too thin it increases the tunnel s buoyancy and the shear stress of the joints if the overburden layer is too thick the external pressure increases and reducing structural stability to limit the impacts of stress instability and costs the buried depth of a tunnel is an important variable in this study a calculation of the reasonable buried depth for an immersed tunnel is presented using the delphi method and fuzzy set theory the weights associated with an engineering analogy foundation settlement structural internal force and seismic load methods each method were obtained for a set of proposed buried depths these weights were used to construct an optimization calculation model for optimal buried depth which was then applied to the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel based on the model

set theory immersed tunnel optimum design calculation reasonable buried depth 1 introduction as economic growth and development becomes more widespread efficient mass transportation systems gain importance often waterways create natural chasms separating all types of landmasses making land travel inconvenient subsea tunnels could provide traffic routes for vehicles and pedestrians crossing straits and estuaries ferle and stekovic 2014 typically underwater tunnels are constructed using one of these methods drilling and blasting shielding or tube immersion hong 2017 liu and yuan 2015 rasmussen 1997 the construction of an immersed tunnel is a complicated process first prefabricated pipe sections are transported to the area where the tunnel is being built next the pipes are lowered to the evacuated foundation groove and butted in sequence forming the undersea channel lastly the soil is backfilled gokce et al 2009 the buried depth of an immersed tunnel is then obtained using the thickness of the backfill plus the depth of seawater as shown in fig 1 the immersed tunnel for this study was built on the seabed the thickness of the overburden is extremely important if too thin the buoyancy of the tunnel and the shear stress of joints would increase if too thick external pressure would increase causing structural instability therefore to limit the impacts of these variables it is important to accurately determine the reasonable buried depth of the tunnel to determine the reasonable buried depth for a subsea tunnel the borehole blasting and shielding methods have been studied with similar engineering conditions the engineering analogy method was reliable but conservative as shown in the norwegian subsea tunnel construction nilsen 1993 japanese minimum leakage method kitamura 1986 miyaguchi 1986 and chinese experiences from mining using the waterbody method sun et al 1999 liu 2003 li et al 2007 studied the buried depth of the subsea tunnel using engineering analogy and numerical analysis methods the sea depth overlying rock thickness and permeability coefficient were investigated through numerical examples by cheng et al 2017 xue et al 2019 established a model using a hybrid intelligent system to predict the overlying rock thickness of a subsea tunnel the above research results provide a good foundation to study the reasonable buried depth for a submerged tunnel to provide a guide for designers grant 2001a b summarized the settlement statistics and calculation methods for a completed immersed tunnel ding et al 2006 established a large scale seismic response calculation model to study immersed tunnels under seismic loading and reveal design weaknesses kasper et al 2008 studied the stability of an immersed tunnel under wave impact using a combination of physical model tests and numerical model simulations the effects of tunnel net buoyancy and tunnel length on the dynamic responses of a submerged floating tunnel under hydrodynamic loads were investigated by long et al 2009 li et al 2014 used physical model tests to evaluate sand deposit expansion and the location in the foundation trench of the immersed tunnel the dynamic characteristics of an immersed tunnel were studied by lee et al 2016 showing fluid compressibility seawater depth tunnel structure location in the water and how energy absorption influenced seismic responses wu et al 2016 investigated the stresses and deformations of the excavation foundation pit in the immersed tunnel chen et al 2018 established a new conceptual pore pressure buildup model to study the wave induced residual liquefaction around the tunnel due to pore pressure accumulation under cyclic shearing he et al 2018 stated that the sand compaction pile method in an immersed tunnel is a robust solution to limit the total and differential longitudinal settlement wang et al 2019 conducted a series of shaking table tests to investigate the characteristics of seismic waves and how it affected the response of immersed tunnel segments these previous studies provide a good foundation for the research of immersed tunnel reasonable buried depth and focus on the immersed tunnel stability and structure however there is no uniform standard or computing method to determine the buried depth of an immersed tunnel immersed tunnels were first built more than 100 years ago providing significant engineering experience for reference to use the engineering analogy method to determine the buried depth typical immersed tunnels are investigated and included in the analogy item then compared with the actual working conditions of the immersed tunnel being designed other methods that are commonly used to determine the buried depth of an immersed tunnel include but are not limited to the following methods foundation settlement structural internal force and seismic load however few single studies have considered multiple influencing factors when determining the buried depth and cannot fully guide the construction of the immersed tunnel therefore it is necessary to determine the buried depth according to the characteristics of each method the delphi method rates each method by a set of experts and obtains the evaluation language of each method in determining the buried depth of an immersed tunnel the fuzzy set theory can reasonably quantify the fuzzy phenomena and related statements from the delphi method in this study we comprehensively considered four methods included engineering analogy method foundation settlement method structural internal force method and seismic load method which were used to calculate buried depths furthermore using the delphi method and fuzzy set theory we obtained the weights associated with each method for a set of proposed buried depths finally an optimization calculation model was built by introducing these weights to calculate the optimal buried depth for a specific submerged tube tunnel namely the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel flowchart of calculation method for the reasonable buried depth is shown in fig 2 2 methodology 2 1 delphi method the delphi method is a group decision making behavior that uses anonymous and sequential consultation to understand complex tasks the expertise experience and subjective judgment of many experts form the basis of this method okoli and pawlowski 2004 brady 2015 when evaluating a project the delphi method is especially suitable for analysis and prediction if pertinent information and historical data are unavailable it can incorporate multiple interactions with experts and converges the scattered opinions into coordinated results the delphi method follows a series of steps 1 identify evaluation goals once the design team clearly defines the objective of effectiveness with the help of logical thinking and expertise the participants generate results through the evaluation of the objective 2 choose the experts to provide beneficial opinions and value judgments experts should have a high degree of authority unique insights rich experience and theoretical understanding of the subject 3 design and distribute the comment consulting table the table should be clear at a glance and conform to the understanding and cognitive abilities of the experts so that they are able to answer truthfully 4 assess the problem the experts should anonymously conduct the evaluation and answer the questions according to the evaluation rules 5 process data the integrated optimization model of expert opinions is established by the original opinions of experts the optimal or satisfactory solution is found by comprehensively considering the consistency and coordination factors 2 2 fuzzy set theory fuzzy set theory is a method that represents ambiguous concepts and establishes appropriate membership functions the fuzzy object is analyzed through the operation and transformation of the fuzzy set there is a mapping on the domain u i e a u 0 1 u u a u 0 1 where a is the fuzzy set on u and u a u is the membership of u to a 1 a λ u μ a u λ u u 0 λ 1 where a λ is the cut set of a to λ if a mapping can be defined as f x y the fuzzy mapping f from f x to f y can be induced by f 2 a f a 3 f a y f x y a x f 1 y 0 f 1 y similarly the fuzzy mapping f 1 from f x to f y can be induced by f 4 f 1 f y f x 5 b f 1 b 6 f 1 b x b f x the fuzzy set can reasonably quantify the fuzzy phenomena and related sentences from the delphi method in this study the natural sentences of very low low medium large and very large were adopted to influence the factors affecting the buried depth of the immersed tunnel in addition the triangular fuzzy function method was selected to calculate and describe expert evaluation the triangle fuzzy function was expressed as a f a b c and its membership function was eq 7 7 f x 0 x a x a b a a x b x b c b b x c 1 x c the fuzzy numbers form and cut set are shown in table 1 in the evaluation each response must be comprehensively considered as the opinions of experts may vary here we used the arithmetic mean to make a comprehensive evaluation 8 x i f 1 f 2 f 3 f n n where x i was the fuzzy number of occurrences f i 1 j n representing the evaluation fuzzy value of event i by the jth expert and n stands for the number of events according to the extension theory of fuzzy set x i was also a fuzzy set setting w i λ z 1 z 2 a λ b c λ d we could solve for λ z 1 b a and λ z 2 d c the relation function expression of the average fuzzy function is given in eq 9 9 f w i z z b a b z a b 1 a b z c d z d c c d z d 0 else to obtain a quantitative value the method of solving ambiguity to analyze the probability of an event is often used defuzzification refers to the process of finding a single value that best reflects the fuzzy set to be solved the ambiguity can be solved by many methods integral value center of gravity weighted average etc for a comprehensive comparison of various factors the integral method was used to solve the fuzzy set this method was chosen because it can be easily applied and can reduce computational burden the expression is shown in eq 10 10 i α μ r a 1 α μ l a where i is the fuzzy solution value α α 0 1 is the control coefficient μ r a represents the integral of the right membership inverse function μ l a stands for the integral of the left membership inverse function for fuzzy trigonometric functions the cut set of μ r a and μ l a can be expressed by eqs 11 and 12 11 μ r a 1 2 λ 0 1 1 n λ λ λ 0 0 9 n λ λ 12 μ l a 1 2 λ 0 1 1 m λ λ λ 0 0 9 m λ λ where n λ is upper limit of fuzzy number a in cut set λ m λ is lower limit of fuzzy number a in cut set λ λ 0 0 1 0 2 1 λ 0 1 finally the weights can be obtained according to the probability of influencing factors by data normalization 3 engineering background known as the project of the century and spanning an expansive cross sea channel the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge is a system of artificial islands cable stayed bridges and an undersea tunnel the immersed tunnel is part of the 35 km highway connecting hong kong zhuhai and macao the landform of the project can be divided into three parts the western hilly region eastern hilly region and central lingdingyang waters the immersed tunnel section is located in the middle of the line which pertains to the lingdingyang waters the geomorphology is simple showing the plain shape of marine deposits the seafloor terrain is relatively flat and the elevation of the mud surface graduates from 7 0 to 12 0 m as shown in the regional survey fig 3 from top to bottom the strata range between mire clay and sand hu et al 2015 in this area there are two types of groundwater porous confined and fissure the pore confined water of loose rocks occurs in the sand layer the soil layer that overlies the sand layer is composed of weak water bearing and water permeable cohesive soil the locally developed sand layer distributes discontinuously amid poor groundwater recharge fracture water consists of weathered fracture water and structural fracture water in the metamorphic rocks it communicates well with the overlying sand layer and constitutes a direct hydraulic connection 4 application of the reasonable buried depth calculation 4 1 calculation method analysis the methods for calculating the reasonable buried depth for an immersed tunnel are numerous and complex because it was difficult to evaluate specific calculation methods we selected several proven ones to determine a reasonable buried depth in this study according to the geological survey data for the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel four methods were used engineering analogy foundation settlement structural internal force and seismic load 1 engineering analogy method a1 engineering analogy is widely used during the design stage when starting a new project designers would naturally consider previous similar projects immersed tunnels were first built more than 100 years ago providing significant experience for reference to use the engineering analogy method in determining the buried depth we investigated a typical immersed tunnel including it in the analogy item and comparing it with the working conditions of the project of interest 2 foundation settlement method a2 many factors influenced the settlement of the immersed tunnel it was mainly caused by the compression deformation of the base layer the tunnel was immersed in an underwater environment contending with a thick soft soil foundation weak mechanical properties and low bearing capacity for the immersed tunnel a deeper depth affected the stability of the tunnel structure 3 structural internal force method a3 during the construction process of the structural internal force analysis method designers fully considered the dynamic effect of structural stress and dynamic change and derived the stress state of the structure the depth of the buried tunnel affected the stress of its structure and the designed life cycle of the pipe sections 4 seismic load method a4 as the immersed tunnel was built on the seabed and buried at a shallow depth the dynamic interaction between the tunnel and soil could not be ignored the soft soil under the tunnel was a porous multiphase medium which produced large deformations resulting in an uneven settlement of the subsea tunnel under the seismic load method special attention was given to the foundation soil stability water and structure coupling and anti floating capacity 4 2 wt calculation to develop a model that reasonably calculates the buried depth of an immersed tunnel the weights of different methods were analyzed after the four methods described above were selected and a model evaluation sample was constructed by the delphi method the weights were calculated using fuzzy set theory five experts from different departments e g academia private construction and design firm participated in the assessment of the calculation method of immersed tunnel buried depth these experts were independent in their evaluation reducing information asymmetry the evaluation language of each individual is shown in table 2 we used the engineering analogy method as an example to calculate the fuzzy number using eqs 8 12 x i f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 5 1 5 0 1 λ 0 0 1 λ 0 2 0 1 λ 0 0 1 λ 0 0 1 λ 0 2 0 1 λ 0 3 0 1 λ 0 5 0 1 λ 0 3 0 1 λ 0 3 0 1 λ 0 5 0 1 λ 0 08 0 1 λ 0 26 μ l a 1 1 2 λ 0 1 1 n λ λ λ 0 0 9 n λ λ 0 13 μ r a 1 1 2 λ 0 1 1 n λ λ λ 0 0 9 n λ λ 0 43 according to eq 10 and taking α 0 5 i 1 α μ r a 1 1 α μ l a 1 0 28 the calculation of the fuzzy numbers is shown in table 3 the weights of each method were also calculated as shown in fig 4 the weight of engineering analogy was 0 13 foundation settlement was 0 34 structural internal force was 0 30 and seismic load is 0 23 4 3 buried depth calculation as the research topic for this study we selected a section of the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel located at k10 563 1 engineering analogy in the case of different subsea tunnels the empirical formulas show that the buried depth is related to seawater depth nilsen 1993 seawater depth affects head pressure a higher the sea depth means a higher overlying rock thickness is needed to balance the head pressure the engineering analogy method is used to determine by comparing projects with similar engineering parameters in this study engineering information of typical immersed tunnels was collected from around the world to analyze the correlation between seawater depth and buried depth table 4 as shown in fig 5 by analyzing the engineering data of different immersed tunnels we derived an empirical equation for buried depth as a function of sea depth 13 h b 0 75 h s 0 69 where h b is the buried depth of immersed tunnel and h s is seawater depth the seawater depth is 17 m at k10 563 so following eq 13 the calculated buried depth of this section is 13 44 m 2 foundation settlement to study the foundation settlement of the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel flac3d software was used to establish a numerical model based on geological data as shown in fig 6 we used various buried depths to adjust the numerical model and calculate the foundation settlement for our numerical simulation using the model the following assumptions were made the rock mass was an equivalent continuous model of homogeneous and isotropic media the initial stress of rock mass only considered the influence of gravity stress tectonic stress was not considered in the model an element with equivalent water pressure is established above the tunnel backfill to simulate the seawater the rock mass deformation was assumed to be governed by the mohr coulomb criterion based on the elastic plastic constitutive model the sand cushion sinking pipe and backfill were assumed as elastic structures the materials such as backfill clay metalling tunnel and sand were defined respectively table 5 and then the numerical model grid was meshed furthermore a horizontal boundary constraint is applied to the left and right sides of the domain the domain is also constrained vertically at the bottom boundary the whole construction stage was simulated by activating the grid and modifying the corresponding unit attributes before simulating excavation the soil gravity stress is regarded as the initial stress field during the definition of construction stage the foundation groove was firstly excavated along the y axis meanwhile the sand and stone cushion was laid at the bottom then the sinking pipe was lowered and finally the backfill was completed this numerical model configuration was used to investigate the foundation settlement at buried depths of 10 15 and 20 m as shown in fig 7 the foundation settlement increased as the buried depth decreased ranging from 118 mm at 20 m 96 mm at 15 m and 67 mm at 10 m during the immersed tunnel construction the foundation settlement mainly consists of two parts the initial subsidence caused by excavation disturbance and the settlement caused by the initial compression of the overlying load of the pipe section excessive settlement will cause structural cracking which will affect the safety of the immersed tunnel wei et al 2013 found that 90 9 of foundation settlement occurred within 100 mm by analyzing 164 sets of field monitoring data therefore a foundation settlement of 100 mm is considered a safety margin based on the numerical calculation results only the buried depths of 15 and 10 m meet this safety requirement given that in general numerical results tend to be lower than actual engineering results due to the assumptions and simplified model formulations the 96 mm settlement at 15 m buried depth was too close to the safety threshold and therefore deemed unfit consequently a buried depth of 10 m was selected for the foundation settlement method 3 structural internal force the same numerical model and configuration was used to investigate the structural internal force at the same buried depths as in the previous section i e 10 15 and 20 m the maximum principal stress at a buried depth of 20 m was 1 90 mpa 1 80 mpa at 15 m and 1 75 mpa at 10 m fig 8 the range of values in maximum principal stress was relatively close with the main area of stress concentration located at the junction of the bottom plate and sidewall when the buried depth of the tunnel was 15 m the affected area was small so this buried depth was selected for the structural internal force method 4 seismic load because research on the seismic response of immersed tunnels is relatively new in the region of interest there is neither a systematic analysis method nor a special seismic standard li 2013 selected a set of buried depths 0 10 and 20 m to establish a model and study the influence of various buried depths on the seismic response of the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel fig 9 the results showed that the seismic response of the immersed tunnel decreases as the buried depth increases following this information a buried depth of 20 m was selected for the seismic load method 4 4 optimal computation four methods included engineering analogy method foundation settlement method structural internal force method and seismic load method were used the values calculated by each method were different we weighted the calculation results for each method to obtain the reasonable buried depth of the immersed tunnel table 6 finally the buried depth of 14 25 m was selected 5 discussion the actual buried depth of this section of the hong kong zhuhai macao immersed tunnel is 16 74 m here a buried depth of 14 25 m was selected by comprehensive consideration based on the numerical simulation model of immersed tunnel established in this study the buried depth is adjusted to verify the applicability from structural stress and ground subsidence the results show that the basement deformation is less than 100 mm and the structure stress is relatively uniform the comparison of actual and calculated values indicates that the buried depth of the immersed tunnel determined on site was conservative with the development of subsea tunnel construction technology it is reasonable to suggest that the buried depth of an immersed tunnel can be reduced to increase the accuracy of calculation more data on immersed tunnels were collected using the engineering analogy method for future research by sharing resources substantial data processing and multidisciplinary cooperation more comprehensive and reliable data can be used to calculate buried depth the bottom of the immersed tunnel analyzed in this study was located in the sand and the recompression deformation of the sand layer was the main cause of subsidence the numerical calculation model performed did not consider the change of sedimentation with time and ignored the main consolidation settlement secondary consolidation settlement instantaneous settlement and seabed silt deposition the numerical simulations produced results that were smaller than the actual value the displacement change at the top of the immersed tunnel was also smaller than that at the bottom we believe that the protective layer of block stone around the sunken tube generally forms a supporting effect like an arch supporting the upper backfill silt layer it was also found that the maximum principal stress of the immersed tunnel was mainly distributed at the junction of the bottom plate and sidewall here it was subjected to pressure from the horizontal and vertical directions and it was in a state of three phase stress resulting in the maximum compressive stress concentration in the process of making the sunken pipe in the stress concentration area it is necessary to strengthen the reinforcement and shear key installation to meet the requirements of tensile and bending resistance to prevent cracks under pressure in the sunken pipe and to prevent seepage at the outer wall 6 conclusions an optimum design calculation method for the reasonable buried depth was established consisting of engineering analogy foundation settlement structural internal force and seismic load 1 the buried depth of the immersed tunnel was influenced by many factors with complicated and uncertain characteristics in this study the weights of each buried depth calculation method were obtained based on the delphi method and fuzzy set theory the weights for the engineering analogy the foundation settlement the structural internal force and the seismic load methods were 0 13 0 34 0 30 and 0 23 respectively 2 the optimization calculation model was applied to the immersed tunnel in the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge finally the buried depth of 14 25 m was selected by comprehensive consideration the research results provide a reference and guide for future research on calculating the buried depth of the immersed tunnel credit authorship

21872,this study aims to investigate the mechanical behavior of soft clay under both shield construction and long term dynamic wave loading in the practical construction of breakwaters to protect coastal power plants continuous rotation of the principal stress axis due to cyclic wave loading is reproduced by altering the control loads that is axial load torque inner cell pressure and outer cell pressure in a hollow cylindrical shear apparatus hca in the hca the confining pressure is progressively reduced to replicate the stress release induced by ground loss during shield construction the hca test results show that both long term wave loading and shield construction significantly affected the dynamic stiffness of soft clay under the combined effects of wave loading and shield construction the post cyclic shear strength and stiffness of the soft clay are reduced more significantly compared to the isolated effect of wave loading especially at lower confining pressure the degradation of the dynamic secant modulus e d and the initial tangential modulus e i is indicated to be synchronous at the end of the cyclic loading test which implies the unique disturbance of the combined action of shield construction and dynamic wave loading on the microstructure of soft clay considered in this study based on the experimental observations a simple and effective constitutive model is also developed to reproduce the degradation of stiffness and shear strength of soft clay induced by shield construction and dynamic wave loading keywords soft clay shield construction wave loading softening hca test constitutive model 1 introduction in the past few decades with the rapid exploitation of china s sea resources a great number of coastal power plants have been constructed in southeastern china in order to protect these power plants from waves it is crucial to build seaside breakwaters that consist of inflow and drainage tunnels which can supply water for production needs and household use in practical engineering of tunnels that pass through breakwaters as shown in fig 1 the mesh shield construction method is often employed owing to its advantages of fast construction and low cost however this method also inevitably causes significant disturbance to the surrounding soil especially soft clays that are characterized by high compressibility and low strength and are widely distributed in the southeastern parts of china yi et al 1993 xu et al 2003 gomes 2013 ng et al 2013 shen et al 2014 guo et al 2019 li et al 2019 tunneling disturbance may degrade the soil s microstructure further weakening its stiffness and strength xu et al 2003 zhu et al 2014 bian et al 2016 meng et al 2018 lin and huang 2019 lowered stiffness and strength of soil in turn compromise the stability of the breakwater and tunnel lin et al 2013 reported that the degradation of surrounding soil induced by tunneling construction disturbance mainly results from factors such as the face support pressure ground loss advance rate shield posture and friction between the shield shell and the ground among these factors face support pressure and ground loss are of utmost importance face support pressure which is not addressed in this study is mainly affected by the workmanship of the shield operator and tunnel crew as well as the operation procedures adopted the ground loss rate δ which is defined by lee et al 1993 as the ratio of the volume of the ground lost to the volume of the tunnel has been shown to be a key factor in controlling soil disturbance mair 2008 standing and selemetas 2013 lin et al 2014 wan et al 2017 this paper discusses ground loss in detail in later sections as illustrated in fig 1 the soft foundation underneath a breakwater will suffer long term wave loading during and after shield construction however most previous investigations have primarily focused on the dynamic behavior of cohesionless soil due to possible occurrence of liquefaction under cyclic wave loading towhata and ishihara 1985 nakata et al 1998 jafarian et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 2017 jeng and zhao 2015 zhao et al 2017a b 2018 chen et al 2018 2020 zhu et al 2019a 2019b nevertheless this phenomenon is not prominent in cohesive soil because of the soil s inherent microstructural bonds and fabric yasuhara et al 1992 stated that both the stiffness and strength of normally consolidated plastic silt would gradually degrade under undrained cyclic loading similar observations were also made in their later studies yasuhara et al 2003 with respect to the post cyclic mechanical properties of over consolidated reconstituted silt moreover cyclic degradation of stiffness was found to be more significant than that of undrained strength of silt kaya and erken 2015 demonstrated that the static strength of soils is distinctly reduced after cyclic loading consequently long term wave loading cycles result in softening of clay owing to the reduction in its stiffness and strength idriss et al 1978 vucetic and dobry 1988 zhou and gong 2001 moses et al 2003 wang et al 2018 based on the aforementioned research it can be concluded that the soft clay beneath the breakwaters will be subjected to a combined disturbance induced by wave loading and shield construction which may severely degrade the mechanical properties of the soft clay eventually leading to the collapse of the breakwater fig 1 accordingly appropriate constitutive models have been developed to replicate the observed typical response of soft clay to monotonic loading cyclic loading or their combination addenbrooke et al 1997 zhang et al 1999 mroueh and shahrour 2003 liao et al 2009 gomes 2013 bian et al 2016 meng et al 2018 tian and yao 2018 zhu et al 2019a to the best of the authors knowledge however previous constitutive models are limited as they separately investigate the degradation of post cyclic stiffness and strength behavior of soft clay this limitation motivates the aim of this research which is to demonstrate the combined effect of external disturbance and cyclic loading on the mechanical behavior of soft clay first the ground loss rate δ was considered the key factor contributing to the disturbance effect of shield construction on surrounding soil and it was simulated by reducing the isotropic confining pressure as suggested by gu et al 2012 then the ground loss rate was incorporated into the hollow cylindrical shear apparatus hca test to reproduce the combined action of shield construction disturbance and wave loading subsequently a specimen was subjected to continuous shear loading for 3000 cycles li et al 2011 wang et al 2013 2018 2019 which is more in line with long term wave loading in the realistic oceanic environment furthermore the specimen was sheared to failure under undrained conditions in order to investigate the properties of soft clay after being subjected to the combined action of wave loading and shield construction li et al 2011 wang et al 2018 2019 based on the hca test results the effects of the ground loss rate δ and the number of wave loadings n on the stiffness and strength of soft clay were investigated finally based on the duncan chang model a simple constitutive model was developed to investigate the soil behavior in response to the combined action of shield construction and long term wave loading the model was validated by comparison with the hca test data 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation for hca test of intact soft clay using a cubical thin wall sampler fig 2 b tested specimens of soft clay fig 2 c were obtained at a depth of 8 m from an excavation site located in hangzhou fig 2 a in southeast china the clay is generally in a normal consolidation state and exhibits obvious cohesion and sufficient soil structure during sampling a plastic sheet was attached to the outer part of the cubic face of the sampler to minimize disturbance to the specimen to prepare undistributed hollow cylindrical samples from the cubic soft clay specimens the inner part of the specimen was cut off first then the wrapped plastic sheet was removed and the outer part of the specimen was trimmed using a knife hollow cylindrical specimens of height h 200 mm outer diameter r o 100 mm and inner diameter r i 60 mm were thus obtained fig 2 b furthermore filter paper strips were attached around the outer surfaces of the specimens to accelerate their consolidation the specimens assembled in an hca are saturated by maintaining skempton s pore pressure parameter b greater than 0 98 the physical properties of the test specimens are summarized as follows the natural water content w is 48 6 the natural density ρ is 1 63 g cm 3 the natural void ratio e is 1 5 the plastic limit w p is 27 6 the liquid limit w l is 52 and the specific gravity g s is 2 75 2 2 hollow cylinder apparatus all the tests were performed on an advanced automatic hca in the geotechnical laboratory of zhejiang university zju china a detailed description of this apparatus was provided by shen et al 2006 in the zju hca axial load w torque t inner cell pressure p i and outer cell pressure p o can be applied to a hollow cylindrical specimen independently fig 3 which enables independent control of the associated axial stress σ z shear stress τ zθ radial stress σ r and circumferential stress σ θ as follows 1 σ z w π r o 2 r i 2 p o r o 2 r i 2 p o r i 2 r o 2 r i 2 σ r p o r o p i r i r o r i σ θ p o r o p i r i r o r i and σ z θ t 2 3 2 π r o 3 r i 3 4 r o 3 r i 3 3 π r o 2 r i 2 r o 4 r i 4 furthermore ψ is the orientation of the major principal stress direction with respect to the vertical axis and σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are the principal stresses as shown in fig 4 by altering w t p i and p o the major principal stress direction can rotate continuously and the stress path of the soft clay under wave loading can be accurately simulated using the zju hca average stresses and strains were calculated according to the methods proposed by hight et al 1983 2 3 fundamental assumptions and experimental design to reproduce the behavior of the soft clay under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction the following assumptions were made 1 as shown in fig 5 the seabed is assumed to possess semi infinite and isotropic elasticity whereas the wave loading acting on the seabed surface is idealized as a simple harmonic wave with a constant wavelength and amplitude then the associated amplitude of cyclic deviatoric stress remains constant at any point in the seabed and the direction of the principal stress axis rotates continuously which results in a circular stress path as plotted in fig 4 2 in the hca test the soft clay specimen is simply assumed to be isotropic consolidated which had been commonly adopted in the elementary test of soil deposit under cyclic loading zhou and gong 2001 wang et al 2013 2018 2019 ye et al 2015 leng et al 2017 for the sake of simplicity the long term effect of wave loading on the soft soil foundation before the construction of the breakwater is not allowed for in the present hca test as well wang et al 2013 2018 2019 leng et al 2017 3 the settlement of the ground surface induced by ground loss during shield construction is simulated by reducing the confining pressure mair 2008 standing et al 2013 wan et al 2017 based on the above mentioned assumptions elementary stresses under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction can be derived as follows at the seabed surface a dynamic wave pressure given by eq 2 is applied using an analytical solution presented by jeng 2003 2 p x p 0 cos κ x ω t where p 0 is the amplitude of the wave pressure at the seabed surface κ 2π l 0 is the wave number ω 2π t is the angular frequency of the waves l 0 is the wavelength and t is the wave period on the basis of boussinesq s theory any elementary stress under wave loading can be derived as 3 σ zw p 0 1 κ z e κ z cos κ x ω t σ xw p 0 1 κ z e κ z cos κ x ω t τ xzw p 0 κ z e κ z sin κ x ω t where σ zw and σ xw are the vertical and horizontal elementary stresses under wave loading respectively and τ xzw is the shear stress in the x z plane the principal stresses under wave loading can be expressed as 4 σ 1 w σ z w σ x w 2 σ z w σ x w 2 2 τ x z w 2 σ 2 w σ x w σ 3 w σ z w σ x w 2 σ z w σ x w 2 2 τ x z w 2 the principal stress angle ψ is 5 ψ 1 2 arctan 2 τ xzw σ zw σ xw the intermediate principal stress parameter b w is 6 b w σ 2 w σ 3 w σ 1 w σ 3 w sin α w 2 it is assumed that the reduction of the confining pressure due to ground loss is uniform and this can be defined in terms of the ground loss rate δ then the elementary stresses under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction can be derived as eq 7 a d 7a σ zc σ zi 1 δ σ zw σ c 1 δ p 0 1 κ z e κ z cos κ x ω t 7b σ rc σ ri 1 δ σ xw σ c 1 δ p 0 1 κ z e κ z cos κ x ω t 7c σ θ c σ θ i 1 δ σ xw σ c 1 δ p 0 1 κ z e

stress after consolidation σ c is the isotropic consolidation stress σ zi σ ri σ θi σ c in the test τ zθi is the shear stress after consolidation τ zθi 0 for isotropic consolidation σ zc σ rc and σ θc are the vertical stress radial stress and circumferential stress respectively under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction and τ zθc is the shear stress under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction in this study to simulate the stress relief due to ground loss during shield construction the confining pressure was gradually reduced by keeping the back pressure constant while adjusting the radial pressure to the set value σ c 1 δ after a certain number of cyclic shear loadings n r moreover the additional dynamic responses of the specimen in the radial and circumferential directions were ignored because only the vertical and tangential loads could be applied in the zju hca therefore the elementary stresses in the zju hca test under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction can be simplified as follows 1 during shield construction n n r 8a σ z e σ 1 δ n n r p 0 1 k z e k z cos k x ω t 8b σ re σ c 1 δ n n r 8c σ θ e

t where σ ze σ re σ θe and τ zθe respectively represent the vertical stress radial stress circumferential stress and shear stress in the zju hca test under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction and n r is the number of cycles required for the reduction of the confining pressure to attain the set value 2 4 simulation of combined action of shield construction and wave loading a total of twelve hca tests illustrated in table 1 were conducted to simulate the combined action of wave loading and shield construction under total number of wave cycles n t note that a ground loss rate δ of 0 30 is adopted as corresponding to a high level of disturbance to surrounding soil during mesh shield construction moreover in view of the effects of soil self weight and the weight of the breakwater three initial confining pressures of 100 200 and 300 kpa were used to represent the shallow middle and deep embedment depths of the soil element underneath the breakwater in previous studies soft clay specimens were subjected to thousands of loading cycles before they reached the residual state li et al 2011 wang et al 2013 2018 2019 therefore n t was fixed to 3000 to investigate the post cyclic characteristics the standing wave effect with amplified wave height that occurs in front of the breakwater is known to significantly enhance the wave pressure p 0 at the seabed surface tsai and lee 1995 jeng 1997 kirca et al 2013 zhao et al 2017a b more importantly the realistic oceanic environment involves the wave breaking process in the vicinity of the breakwater due to the shoaling effect the breaking waves hitting on the structure can imply significantly impact loading on the structure and subsequently on the seabed foundation kirkgoz 1990 wienkea and oumeraci 2005 cuomo et al 2010 according to the investigation by wang et al 2012 on the field measured maximum wave pressure of the qiantang bore p 0 can reach up to 70 kpa in addition the cyclic degradation effect of soft clay cannot be clearly observed until the cyclic stress ratio csr p 0 1 κz e κz σ c 1 δ is greater than 0 10 hyodo et al 1992 zhou and gong 2001 leng et al 2017 consequently p 0 should be sufficiently strong to maintain the csr above 0 1 under any value of confining pressure considering the abovementioned criteria in the present hca tests p 0 was set to 45 kpa as seen in fig 6 a after the specimen was installed in the hca it was isotropically consolidated with the planned initial constant confining pressure σ 3i 100 kpa 200 kpa or 300 kpa subsequently the confining pressure of the specimen was progressively reduced to σ 3i 1 δ meanwhile the specimen was subjected to cyclic shear loading with stress control at a frequency of 0 5 hz teh et al 2003 krica et al 2013 leng et al 2017 the number of cycles was 3000 finally as shown in fig 6 b the specimen was sheared to failure with a maximum strain of 15 under strain control at a constant axial strain rate of 0 05 min in a static undrained triaxial condition according to the chinese geotechnical test specification sl237 1999 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 1999 to validate the test plan in section 2 3 for the zju hca figs 7 and 8 compare the stresses tested in t12 solid blue line with the theoretical values calculated using eqs 8 and 9 dashed red line as seen in fig 7 a and d during shield construction both the tested σ z and τ zθ displayed good agreement with the theoretical values calculated using eq 8 a and d moreover both the tested σ r and σ θ finally achieved the set value as shown in fig 7 b and c although there is a slight difference between the tested results and the theoretical values calculated using eq 8 b and c which can be attributed to the common deficiency of the existing hca apparatus which is incapable of applying the vertical and tangential loads alone as shown in fig 8 a d after shield construction all the tested stresses σ z σ r σ θ and τ zθ agreed well with those calculated using eqs 9 a d thus it can be concluded that the test plan was effectively carried out by using the zju hca 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamic response of soft clay under shield construction and long term wave loading as mentioned earlier for the soil element in soft clay cyclic softening is one of the main effects of cyclic loading this phenomenon is similar to the cyclic mobility of loose sand deposits boulanger and idriss 2007 patiño et al 2013 fig 9 shows the stress strain relationship of the tested specimens at an initial confining stress σ 3i of 100 kpa under the combined action of wave motion and shield construction the slope of the stress strain curve representing the stiffness of the tested specimen continuously decreases as the number of wave loading cycle increases the specimen having a higher ground loss rate δ is more likely to become softened in the course of long term wave loading because shield construction causes significant disturbance to surrounding soil relieving the confining pressure which in turn enlarges the void ratio and reduces the stiffness of soft clay to further illustrate the softening behavior in detail fig 10 presents the dynamic secant modulus e d σ z ε z of the tested specimen in each cycle representing the nominal stiffness where σ z and ε z are the stress and strain amplitudes in a unit cycle respectively the variation of e d with number of loading cycles at different ground loss rates and effective confining pressure is shown in fig 11 for all tested samples e d decreased gradually with increasing loading cycles indicating the softening behavior of soil due to the ground loss and cyclic wave shearing a similar phenomenon was observed by li et al 2011 and leng et al 2017 the softening behavior of soil in terms of degradation of soil stiffness become increasingly pronounced as ground loss rates δ increase at σ 3i 100 kpa when δ was increased from 0 to 10 e d decreased by a further 5 1 to 22 5 and when δ was increased from 0 to 20 and from 0 to 30 the resulting decreases in e d were 26 4 and 32 9 respectively the results also indicate that at lower confining pressure the joint influences of ground loss rate and cyclic wave loading become more significant it can be seen that at σ 3i 100 and with δ 30 the reduction in e d 32 9 was approximately twice of that when shield construction action was not considered 17 4 whereas only a further reduction of e d by around 34 can be observed as the confining pressure increased to 200 kpa this indicated that the disturbance effect weakening the microstructural bonds and fabric of soft foundation is more likely to occur in shallow soil element under the shield construction and cyclic wave motions in addition the above investigations on the soften effect of shield construction and long term wave loading on the soft clay are fundamental and some disturbance factors such as face support pressure in shield construction and softening effect of the wave loading on the post cyclic shear strength of soft clay and k 0 consolidation state for natural soil deposits etc will be addressed in future studies 3 2 mechanical behavior of soft clay after shield construction and long term wave loading a series of undrained monotonic triaxial tests were further conducted to investigate the post cyclic mechanical behavior of soft clay after the combined action of shield construction and long term wave loading a total of 3000 wave loading cycles n were applied in each test with different ground loss rates ranging from 0 to 30 fig 11 shows the relationship between the deviatoric stress i e the difference between the major and minor principal stresses and axial strains at different ground loss rates for tests t10 t11 t12 and t33 all the results for the stress strain relationship generally show a hyperbolic distribution which is in accordance with the triaxial shear test results for marine silty clay wang et al 2019 as expected the initial tangential modulus e i and the peak strength σ 1 σ 3r f of σ 1 σ 3r ε z curves increased with increasing initial confining pressure where σ 1 is the maximum post combined action principal stress and σ 3r is the minimum post combined action principal stress for example σ 1 σ 3r f increased by approximately 50 from σ 3i 100 kpa to σ 3i 300 kpa for δ 0 this is because the initial confining pressure σ 3i is highly dependent on the buried depth the soft clay at a deeper location will be densified by the weight of overlying soil which strengthens its microstructural bonds and fabric as a result both e i and σ 1 σ 3r f of soft clay at higher σ 3i are larger than those at lower σ 3i fig 12 indicates that features of the stress strain curves that is e i and σ 1 σ 3r f varied with the ground loss rate taking σ 3i 100 kpa for instance σ 1 σ 3r f approached 120 kpa for δ 0 however when δ 10 σ 1 σ 3r f decreased to approximately 100 kpa and σ 1 σ 3r f decreased gradually when δ 30 σ 1 σ 3r f reached approximately 80 kpa which is an approximately 1 3rd decrease compared with σ 1 σ 3r f 120 kpa for δ 0 a similar phenomenon can also be observed in the triaxial shear tests on specimens with σ 3i 200 kpa and 300 kpa the above observation can be attributed to the fact that ground loss induced by shield construction significantly contributes to disturbance in surrounding soft clay and reduces the confining pressure subsequently the void ratio of soft clay increases and the inherent microstructural fabric of soft clay is further reorganized which leads to the reduction in e i and σ 1 σ 3r f 4 simple constitutive model considering the softening effect of combined action 4 1 original duncan chang model in general an elasto plastic model has proven to be more realistic in reproducing the dynamic soil behavior including nonlinearity stress dependency inelasticity and plasticity of soil when subjected to cyclic loading however its inherent defect in convergence limits its application in resolving practical problems related to civil engineering nogueira et al 2009 as the most representative nonlinear elastic model the duncan chang model is capable of considering the nonlinearity and stress dependency of soil behavior and provides excellent performance in convergence and thus it has been widely used in the numerical simulation of practical engineering problems franzius et al 2005 yazdchi et al 2006 in the original duncan chang model duncan and chang 1970 a hyperbolic function suggested by kondner 1963 was adopted to simulate the nonlinear stress strain curve of soil as follows 10 σ 1 σ 3 ε 1 a b ε 1 where a and b are constants that are determined experimentally with visualized physical meanings moreover a is the reciprocal of the initial tangent modulus e i and b is the reciprocal of the asymptotic value of the stress difference when the stress strain curve approaches infinite strain σ 1 σ 3 ult kondner 1963 found that the coefficients a and b can be determined more readily if the stress strain data are plotted on transformed axes then eq 10 can be rewritten as 11 ε 1 σ 1 σ 3 a b ε 1 duncan and chang 1970 suggested that a and b can be determined as 12a a 1 e i ε 1 σ 1 σ 3 95 ε 1 σ 1 σ 3 70 2 ε 1 95 ε 1 70 2 σ 1 σ 3 ult and 12b b 1 σ 1 σ 3 ult ε 1 σ 1 σ 3 95 ε 1 σ 1 σ 3 70 ε 1 95 ε 1 70 where the subscripts 95 and 70 represent the values of σ 1 σ 3 equal to 95 and 70 of the peak strength σ 1 σ 3 f respectively as suggested by janbu 1963 the initial tangent modulus e i can be defined as 13 e i k p a σ 3 p a n where k and n are the model parameters the relationship between σ 1 σ 3 f and σ 1 σ 3 ult is established by the failure ratio r f as 14 r f σ 1 σ 3 f σ 1 σ 3 ult according to the mohr coulomb strength criterion σ 1 σ 3 f can be related to the strength parameters c and ϕ 15 σ 1 σ 3 f 2 c cos φ σ 3 sin φ 1 sin φ where c and ϕ are the cohesive force and internal friction angle respectively which can be determined by the drained or undrained triaxial tests of soil at different confining pressures e g 100 200 and 300 kpa then r f can be defined as 16 r f 2 c cos φ σ 3 sin φ 1 sin φ σ 1 σ 3 ult as discussed previously there are a total of five parameters k n c ϕ and r f in the original duncan chang model which can be determined by conducting drained or undrained triaxial tests of soil under different confining pressures however this model is limited to considering the soil response at a certain state e g at an initial state without wave loading or shield construction and it cannot reproduce the degradation of soil stiffness and weakening of soil strength due to long term wave loading and shield construction which are the main features observed in the tests described in previous sections in this study the original duncan chang model is further modified to incorporate the experimental findings as fig 11 shows the dynamic stiffness of the soft clay in terms of the secant modulus e d decreases progressively due to shield construction via δ and long term wave loading via δ however it is not clear whether the post cyclic stiffness e i will follow the similar reduction as e d under the combined action of shield construction and wave loading a traditional method to determine the influence of n and δ on e i is to conduct associated triaxial tests for each loading wave cycle however this method is not feasible owing to the high material cost according to the undrained triaxial test results of the soft clay shown in fig 12 the parameter e i at each confining stress can be determined by eq 12b as illustrated in table 2 the secant modulus e d after 3000 loading cycles is also presented for comparison clearly the ratio e i e d for all three confining stresses is approximately 37 2 which is larger than the ratio of 12 5 more or less for low plasticity silt yasuhara et al 2003 due to the weak microstructure of the soft clay addressed in the present study in other words the softening effect of wave loading on both the dynamic and post cyclic stiffness of soft clay is synchronous which can be attributed to the fact that the disturbance induced by wave loading to the microstructure of soft clay is unique consequently this ratio can be assumed to be applicable to all loading cycles then the associated e i at each cycle can be estimated by amplifying the value of e d by 37 2 as shown in fig 11 in addition the peak strength shown in table 3 under different confining pressures can be obtained from fig 12 for simplicity in the figure the softening effect due to wave loading is not considered here σ 1 σ 3r fsw is the peak strength under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction and σ 1 σ 3r fw is the peak strength under wave loading alone it can be seen that both the peak strength σ 1 σ 3r fsw and its associated reduction rate η σ 1 σ 3r fw σ 1 σ 3r fsw σ 1 σ 3r fw are more positively related to δ under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction compared with the case of wave loading alone moreover η is negatively correlated with increasing σ 3r because of the stress dissipation effect induced by the wave loading along the buried depth 4 2 influence of shield construction and long term wave loading on stiffness equation 13 can also be expressed as 17 lg e i p a lg k n lg σ 3 r p a as shown in tables 4 and 5 the values of parameters k and n can be determined readily using eq 17 and the estimated e i as mentioned above the parameter n is observed to be insensitive to varying n and δ so it can be kept constant n 1 18 during the combined action of shield construction and long term wave motions however parameter k is strongly dependent on n and δ suppose that the variation of k and n with δ 0 may be represented by 18 k t k 0 d ln n 1 where k 0 209 84 is a dimensionless model parameter for the intact soft clay without any disturbance as shown in fig 13 a and d 4 68 is another dimensionless model parameter related to the physical parameters of soft clay e g natural void ratio e and water content w then a new factor a δ is introduced to consider the effects of δ in eq 18 19 k k t 1 a δ according to the test data after a certain time of wave loading e g t 500 t a δ can be calculated by combining eqs 18 and 19 the result is presented in fig 12 b 20 a δ m δ where m 0 50 is a dimensionless model parameter related to the physical parameters of intact soft clay as shown in fig 13 k is greatly dependent on n and δ with both correlation coefficients being greater than 0 99 based on this with the consideration of the combined effects of shield construction and long term wave motions the parameter k can be derived as 21 k k 0 d ln n 1 1 m δ 4 3 effect of shield construction on shear strength as illustrated in fig 14 the values of the undrained cohesion c u and undrained internal frictional angle ϕ u under different ground losses can be determined from σ 1 σ 3 f given in table 3 on the basis of the mohr coulomb criterion in this calculation for simplicity the effect of cyclic wave loading on soil softening in terms of c u and ϕ u is not considered after conducting extensive trial tests on the fitting of the experimental data shown in fig 14 it was found that both c u and ϕ u exhibit a good quadratic relationship with δ which can be derived as 22 c u p a c u0 p a h 1 δ h 2 δ 2 and tan φ u tan φ u0 g 1 δ g 2 δ 2 then 23 c u c u0 h 1 δ h 2 δ 2 p a and φ u arctan tan φ u0 g 1 δ g 2 δ 2 where c u0 and ϕ u0 are the initial undrained cohesion and undrained internal friction angle without ground loss and wave loading respectively h 1 0 23 and h 2 0 30 are the dimensionless model parameters for cohesion which are dependent on factors such as mineral types and soil fabric g 1 0 33 and g 2 0 51 are dimensionless model parameters for the internal frictional angle which are related to factors such as mineral types and roughness of soil particles p a 101 3 kpa is the pressure for normalizing c u fig 14 also indicates that with increasing δ both c u and tan ϕ u decreased nonlinearly moreover tan ϕ u with a 30 ground loss rate decreased by 13 1 in comparison with those without shield construction this is attributed to the fact that reduction of the confining pressure due to ground loss induced by shield construction loosens the soft clay microstructure and modifies the slip and movement between soft clay particles furthermore the void ratio of the soft clay increases and eventually ϕ u decreases zhu et al 2014 a similar trend of reduction in c u can be observed in fig 13 this is due to the breaking of the microstructure of the soft clay due to shield construction 4 4 effect of shield construction on failure ratio the values of σ 1 σ 3 ult and the instant failure ratio r f determined by eq 14 are listed in table 6 clearly r f ranged from 0 91 to 0 99 on average 0 96 is weakly correlated to δ and it can be approximately considered to be constant 0 96 during shield construction 4 5 modified duncan chang model and its verification based on the above discussions it can be concluded that long term wave loading and shield construction will alter the mechanical properties of soft clay including c u ϕ u and k which cannot be covered in the original duncan chang model here by substituting eqs 13 15 and 21 and 23 into eq 10 a modified duncan chang model that considers the softening effect of shield construction and long term wave loading can be expressed as 24 σ 1 σ 3 ε 1 1 k 0 d ln n 1 1 m δ p a σ 3 p a n 1 sin arctan tan φ u 0 g 1 δ g 2 δ 2 2 c u0 h 1 δ h 2 δ 2 p a cos arctan tan φ u0 g 1 δ g 2 δ 2 σ 3 sin arctan tan φ u0 g 1 δ g 2 δ 2 r f ε 1 a total of eleven parameters namely c u0 ϕ u0 k 0 r f n d m g 1 g 2 h 1 and h 2 are covered in the proposed model among these c u0 ϕ u0 k 0 r f and n can be obtained by the traditional undrained triaxial tests which is the same as the original duncan chang model and d m g 1 g 2 h 1 and h 2 should be calibrated by conducting hollow torsional shear experiments to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the developed framework with regards to its capability of incorporating the softening effect of shield construction and long term wave loading the model results are compared with existing measured data obtained from the hollow cylindrical tests as presented in fig 15 to demonstrate the advantage of the developed model the results predicted by the original duncan chang model are also compared the input parameters considered in this analysis are summarized in table 7 the stress strain relationship at any initial confining pressure σ 3i and ground loss rate δ predicted by the present model agrees reasonably well with the experimental data especially at the initial loading stage this is because the present model takes into account the combined softening effect induced by shield construction and long term wave loading by introducing parameters d m g 1 g 2 h 1 and h 2 consequently the stress strain relationship of soft clay at any σ 3i and δ can be well replicated by the present model by contrast the stress strain relationship of soft clay predicted by the original duncan chang model only performed well under the condition δ 0 under any other conditions with δ 0 the predicted results of the original duncan chang model exceeded the experimental results this is because the original duncan chang model does not consider the combined softening effect of shield construction and long term wave loading and thus significantly overestimates the stress strain relationship of clay soil this may result in unsafe design in practical engineering the present model which can reproduce the response of soft clay to the combined action of shield construction and wave loading has wide application prospects in future numerical analysis with respect to various coastal engineering issues such as the construction of coastal power plants however the developed constitutive model effectively reproduces only the post cyclic soil response to post combined action of shield construction and wave loading but not the dynamic features of soft clay under wave loading this will be addressed in future studies 5 conclusions 1 the elementary stresses in hca test σ z σ r σ θ τ zθ under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction was derived based on boussinesq s theory and the assumption of reproducing the ground loss with the relief of confining pressure in equivalent amplitude the hca tests indicate that the stiffness degradation with time becomes increasingly pronounced as ground loss rates δ increases and effective confining pressure decreases which demonstrate that the disturbance effect weakening the microstructural bonds and fabric of soft foundation is more likely to occur in shallow soil element under the combined shield construction and cyclic wave motions 2 the degradation of the dynamic secant modulus e d and the post cyclic initial tangential modulus e i is indicated to be synchronous by the experimental results after 3000 loading cycles the ratio e i e d approximately approaches to 37 2 regardless of confining pressure which indicate the unique disturbance of the combined action of shield construction and wave loading on the microstructure of soft clay considered in this study this triggers an alternative determination of e i at a specific wave cycle by amplifying the associated e d by 37 2 instead of by conducting associated triaxial tests within traditional framework which significantly reduces experimental cost 3 based on the estimated initial tangent modulus e i the sensitive of model parameters k and n of original duncan chang model to δ and wave cycles n were investigated it is found that k decrease in logarithm function with the increase of n for a specific of δ and decrease linearly with the increase of δ at a certain of wave cycles accordingly the empirical relationship between k and δ n was presented however n is independent of both δ and n the influences of δ on the other three model constants c u ϕ u r f were also addressed regardless of wave cycles for simplicity it is observed that both c u and ϕ u exhibit a good quadratic relationship with δ due to the shield construction s negative disturbance to the microstructure of soft clay nonetheless r f is poorly correlated to δ 4 the modified duncan chang model incorporating the empirical relationship between k c u ϕ u and wave cycles and ground loss rate is developed the model results fit well with the experimental data and provide a better prediction than the original duncan chang model this demonstrates the capability of the developed model to consider considering the disturbance to the fabric of soft clay and subsequent softening effect on the macro mechanical parameters k c u and ϕ u etc induced by the combined action of shield construction and wave loading

21872,this study aims to investigate the mechanical behavior of soft clay under both shield construction and long term dynamic wave loading in the practical construction of breakwaters to protect coastal power plants continuous rotation of the principal stress axis due to cyclic wave loading is reproduced by altering the control loads that is axial load torque inner cell pressure and outer cell pressure in a hollow cylindrical shear apparatus hca in the hca the confining pressure is progressively reduced to replicate the stress release induced by ground loss during shield construction the hca test results show that both long term wave loading and shield construction significantly affected the dynamic stiffness of soft clay under the combined effects of wave loading and shield construction the post cyclic shear strength and stiffness of the soft clay are reduced more significantly compared to the isolated effect of wave loading especially at lower confining pressure the degradation of the dynamic secant modulus e d and the initial tangential modulus e i is indicated to be synchronous at the end of the cyclic loading test which implies the unique disturbance of the combined action of shield construction and dynamic wave loading on the microstructure of soft clay considered in this study based on the experimental observations a simple and effective constitutive model is also developed to reproduce the degradation of stiffness and shear strength of soft clay induced by shield construction and dynamic wave loading keywords soft clay shield construction wave loading softening hca test constitutive model 1 introduction in the past few decades with the rapid exploitation of china s sea resources a great number of coastal power plants have been constructed in southeastern china in order to protect these power plants from waves it is crucial to build seaside breakwaters that consist of inflow and drainage tunnels which can supply water for production needs and household use in practical engineering of tunnels that pass through breakwaters as shown in fig 1 the mesh shield construction method is often employed owing to its advantages of fast construction and low cost however this method also inevitably causes significant disturbance to the surrounding soil especially soft clays that are characterized by high compressibility and low strength and are widely distributed in the southeastern parts of china yi et al 1993 xu et al 2003 gomes 2013 ng et al 2013 shen et al 2014 guo et al 2019 li et al 2019 tunneling disturbance may degrade the soil s microstructure further weakening its stiffness and strength xu et al 2003 zhu et al 2014 bian et al 2016 meng et al 2018 lin and huang 2019 lowered stiffness and strength of soil in turn compromise the stability of the breakwater and tunnel lin et al 2013 reported that the degradation of surrounding soil induced by tunneling construction disturbance mainly results from factors such as the face support pressure ground loss advance rate shield posture and friction between the shield shell and the ground among these factors face support pressure and ground loss are of utmost importance face support pressure which is not addressed in this study is mainly affected by the workmanship of the shield operator and tunnel crew as well as the operation procedures adopted the ground loss rate δ which is defined by lee et al 1993 as the ratio of the volume of the ground lost to the volume of the tunnel has been shown to be a key factor in controlling soil disturbance mair 2008 standing and selemetas 2013 lin et al 2014 wan et al 2017 this paper discusses ground loss in detail in later sections as illustrated in fig 1 the soft foundation underneath a breakwater will suffer long term wave loading during and after shield construction however most previous investigations have primarily focused on the dynamic behavior of cohesionless soil due to possible occurrence of liquefaction under cyclic wave loading towhata and ishihara 1985 nakata et al 1998 jafarian et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 2017 jeng and zhao 2015 zhao et al 2017a b 2018 chen et al 2018 2020 zhu et al 2019a 2019b nevertheless this phenomenon is not prominent in cohesive soil because of the soil s inherent microstructural bonds and fabric yasuhara et al 1992 stated that both the stiffness and strength of normally consolidated plastic silt would gradually degrade under undrained cyclic loading similar observations were also made in their later studies yasuhara et al 2003 with respect to the post cyclic mechanical properties of over consolidated reconstituted silt moreover cyclic degradation of stiffness was found to be more significant than that of undrained strength of silt kaya and erken 2015 demonstrated that the static strength of soils is distinctly reduced after cyclic loading consequently long term wave loading cycles result in softening of clay owing to the reduction in its stiffness and strength idriss et al 1978 vucetic and dobry 1988 zhou and gong 2001 moses et al 2003 wang et al 2018 based on the aforementioned research it can be concluded that the soft clay beneath the breakwaters will be subjected to a combined disturbance induced by wave loading and shield construction which may severely degrade the mechanical properties of the soft clay eventually leading to the collapse of the breakwater fig 1 accordingly appropriate constitutive models have been developed to replicate the observed typical response of soft clay to monotonic loading cyclic loading or their combination addenbrooke et al 1997 zhang et al 1999 mroueh and shahrour 2003 liao et al 2009 gomes 2013 bian et al 2016 meng et al 2018 tian and yao 2018 zhu et al 2019a to the best of the authors knowledge however previous constitutive models are limited as they separately investigate the degradation of post cyclic stiffness and strength behavior of soft clay this limitation motivates the aim of this research which is to demonstrate the combined effect of external disturbance and cyclic loading on the mechanical behavior of soft clay first the ground loss rate δ was considered the key factor contributing to the disturbance effect of shield construction on surrounding soil and it was simulated by reducing the isotropic confining pressure as suggested by gu et al 2012 then the ground loss rate was incorporated into the hollow cylindrical shear apparatus hca test to reproduce the combined action of shield construction disturbance and wave loading subsequently a specimen was subjected to continuous shear loading for 3000 cycles li et al 2011 wang et al 2013 2018 2019 which is more in line with long term wave loading in the realistic oceanic environment furthermore the specimen was sheared to failure under undrained conditions in order to investigate the properties of soft clay after being subjected to the combined action of wave loading and shield construction li et al 2011 wang et al 2018 2019 based on the hca test results the effects of the ground loss rate δ and the number of wave loadings n on the stiffness and strength of soft clay were investigated finally based on the duncan chang model a simple constitutive model was developed to investigate the soil behavior in response to the combined action of shield construction and long term wave loading the model was validated by comparison with the hca test data 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation for hca test of intact soft clay using a cubical thin wall sampler fig 2 b tested specimens of soft clay fig 2 c were obtained at a depth of 8 m from an excavation site located in hangzhou fig 2 a in southeast china the clay is generally in a normal consolidation state and exhibits obvious cohesion and sufficient soil structure during sampling a plastic sheet was attached to the outer part of the cubic face of the sampler to minimize disturbance to the specimen to prepare undistributed hollow cylindrical samples from the cubic soft clay specimens the inner part of the specimen was cut off first then the wrapped plastic sheet was removed and the outer part of the specimen was trimmed using a knife hollow cylindrical specimens of height h 200 mm outer diameter r o 100 mm and inner diameter r i 60 mm were thus obtained fig 2 b furthermore filter paper strips were attached around the outer surfaces of the specimens to accelerate their consolidation the specimens assembled in an hca are saturated by maintaining skempton s pore pressure parameter b greater than 0 98 the physical properties of the test specimens are summarized as follows the natural water content w is 48 6 the natural density ρ is 1 63 g cm 3 the natural void ratio e is 1 5 the plastic limit w p is 27 6 the liquid limit w l is 52 and the specific gravity g s is 2 75 2 2 hollow cylinder apparatus all the tests were performed on an advanced automatic hca in the geotechnical laboratory of zhejiang university zju china a detailed description of this apparatus was provided by shen et al 2006 in the zju hca axial load w torque t inner cell pressure p i and outer cell pressure p o can be applied to a hollow cylindrical specimen independently fig 3 which enables independent control of the associated axial stress σ z shear stress τ zθ radial stress σ r and circumferential stress σ θ as follows 1 σ z w π r o 2 r i 2 p o r o 2 r i 2 p o r i 2 r o 2 r i 2 σ r p o r o p i r i r o r i σ θ p o r o p i r i r o r i and σ z θ t 2 3 2 π r o 3 r i 3 4 r o 3 r i 3 3 π r o 2 r i 2 r o 4 r i 4 furthermore ψ is the orientation of the major principal stress direction with respect to the vertical axis and σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are the principal stresses as shown in fig 4 by altering w t p i and p o the major principal stress direction can rotate continuously and the stress path of the soft clay under wave loading can be accurately simulated using the zju hca average stresses and strains were calculated according to the methods proposed by hight et al 1983 2 3 fundamental assumptions and experimental design to reproduce the behavior of the soft clay under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction the following assumptions were made 1 as shown in fig 5 the seabed is assumed to possess semi infinite and isotropic elasticity whereas the wave loading acting on the seabed surface is idealized as a simple harmonic wave with a constant wavelength and amplitude then the associated amplitude of cyclic deviatoric stress remains constant at any point in the seabed and the direction of the principal stress axis rotates continuously which results in a circular stress path as plotted in fig 4 2 in the hca test the soft clay specimen is simply assumed to be isotropic consolidated which had been commonly adopted in the elementary test of soil deposit under cyclic loading zhou and gong 2001 wang et al 2013 2018 2019 ye et al 2015 leng et al 2017 for the sake of simplicity the long term effect of wave loading on the soft soil foundation before the construction of the breakwater is not allowed for in the present hca test as well wang et al 2013 2018 2019 leng et al 2017 3 the settlement of the ground surface induced by ground loss during shield construction is simulated by reducing the confining pressure mair 2008 standing et al 2013 wan et al 2017 based on the above mentioned assumptions elementary stresses under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction can be derived as follows at the seabed surface a dynamic wave pressure given by eq 2 is applied using an analytical solution presented by jeng 2003 2 p x p 0 cos κ x ω t where p 0 is the amplitude of the wave pressure at the seabed surface κ 2π l 0 is the wave number ω 2π t is the angular frequency of the waves l 0 is the wavelength and t is the wave period on the basis of boussinesq s theory any elementary stress under wave loading can be derived as 3 σ zw p 0 1 κ z e κ z cos κ x ω t σ xw p 0 1 κ z e κ z cos κ x ω t τ xzw p 0 κ z e κ z sin κ x ω t where σ zw and σ xw are the vertical and horizontal elementary stresses under wave loading respectively and τ xzw is the shear stress in the x z plane the principal stresses under wave loading can be expressed as 4 σ 1 w σ z w σ x w 2 σ z w σ x w 2 2 τ x z w 2 σ 2 w σ x w σ 3 w σ z w σ x w 2 σ z w σ x w 2 2 τ x z w 2 the principal stress angle ψ is 5 ψ 1 2 arctan 2 τ xzw σ zw σ xw the intermediate principal stress parameter b w is 6 b w σ 2 w σ 3 w σ 1 w σ 3 w sin α w 2 it is assumed that the reduction of the confining pressure due to ground loss is uniform and this can be defined in terms of the ground loss rate δ then the elementary stresses under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction can be derived as eq 7 a d 7a σ zc σ zi 1 δ σ zw σ c 1 δ p 0 1 κ z e κ z cos κ x ω t 7b σ rc σ ri 1 δ σ xw σ c 1 δ p 0 1 κ z e κ z cos κ x ω t 7c σ θ c σ θ i 1 δ σ xw σ c 1 δ p 0 1 κ z e κ z cos κ x ω t and 7d τ z θ c τ xzi τ xzw p 0 κ z e κ z sin κ x ω t where σ zi is the vertical stress after consolidation σ ri is the radial stress after consolidation σ θ0 is the circumferential stress after consolidation σ c is the isotropic consolidation stress σ zi σ ri σ θi σ c in the test τ zθi is the shear stress after consolidation τ zθi 0 for isotropic consolidation σ zc σ rc and σ θc are the vertical stress radial stress and circumferential stress respectively under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction and τ zθc is the shear stress under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction in this study to simulate the stress relief due to ground loss during shield construction the confining pressure was gradually reduced by keeping the back pressure constant while adjusting the radial pressure to the set value σ c 1 δ after a certain number of cyclic shear loadings n r moreover the additional dynamic responses of the specimen in the radial and circumferential directions were ignored because only the vertical and tangential loads could be applied in the zju hca therefore the elementary stresses in the zju hca test under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction can be simplified as follows 1 during shield construction n n r 8a σ z e σ 1 δ n n r p 0 1 k z e k z cos k x ω t 8b σ re σ c 1 δ n n r 8c σ θ e σ c 1 δ n n r and 8d τ zθe p 0 κ z e κ z sin κ x ω t 2 after shield construction n nr 9a σ ze σ c 1 δ p 0 1 κ z e κ z cos κ x ω t 9b σ re σ c 1 δ 9c σ θ e σ c 1 δ and 9d τ zθe p 0 κ z e κ z sin κ x ω t where σ ze σ re σ θe and τ zθe respectively represent the vertical stress radial stress circumferential stress and shear stress in the zju hca test under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction and n r is the number of cycles required for the reduction of the confining pressure to attain the set value 2 4 simulation of combined action of shield construction and wave loading a total of twelve hca tests illustrated in table 1 were conducted to simulate the combined action of wave loading and shield construction under total number of wave cycles n t note that a ground loss rate δ of 0 30 is adopted as corresponding to a high level of disturbance to surrounding soil during mesh shield construction moreover in view of the effects of soil self weight and the weight of the breakwater three initial confining pressures of 100 200 and 300 kpa were used to represent the shallow middle and deep embedment depths of the soil element underneath the breakwater in previous studies soft clay specimens were subjected to thousands of loading cycles before they reached the residual state li et al 2011 wang et al 2013 2018 2019 therefore n t was fixed to 3000 to investigate the post cyclic characteristics the standing wave effect with amplified wave height that occurs in front of the breakwater is known to significantly enhance the wave pressure p 0 at the seabed surface tsai and lee 1995 jeng 1997 kirca et al 2013 zhao et al 2017a b more importantly the realistic oceanic environment involves the wave breaking process in the vicinity of the breakwater due to the shoaling effect the breaking waves hitting on the structure can imply significantly impact loading on the structure and subsequently on the seabed foundation kirkgoz 1990 wienkea and oumeraci 2005 cuomo et al 2010 according to the investigation by wang et al 2012 on the field measured maximum wave pressure of the qiantang bore p 0 can reach up to 70 kpa in addition the cyclic degradation effect of soft clay cannot be clearly observed until the cyclic stress ratio csr p 0 1 κz e κz σ c 1 δ is greater than 0 10 hyodo et al 1992 zhou and gong 2001 leng et al 2017 consequently p 0 should be sufficiently strong to maintain the csr above 0 1 under any value of confining pressure considering the abovementioned criteria in the present hca tests p 0 was set to 45 kpa as seen in fig 6 a after the specimen was installed in the hca it was isotropically consolidated with the planned initial constant confining pressure σ 3i 100 kpa 200 kpa or 300 kpa subsequently the confining pressure of the specimen was progressively reduced to σ 3i 1 δ meanwhile the specimen was subjected to cyclic shear loading with stress control at a frequency of 0 5 hz teh et al 2003 krica et al 2013 leng et al 2017 the number of cycles was 3000 finally as shown in fig 6 b the specimen was sheared to failure with a maximum strain of 15 under strain control at a constant axial strain rate of 0 05 min in a static undrained triaxial condition according to the chinese geotechnical test specification sl237 1999 the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 1999 to validate the test plan in section 2 3 for the zju hca figs 7 and 8 compare the stresses tested in t12 solid blue line with the theoretical values calculated using eqs 8 and 9 dashed red line as seen in fig 7 a and d during shield construction both the tested σ z and τ zθ displayed good agreement with the theoretical values calculated using eq 8 a and d moreover both the tested σ r and σ θ finally achieved the set value as shown in fig 7 b and c although there is a slight difference between the tested results and the theoretical values calculated using eq 8 b and c which can be attributed to the common deficiency of the existing hca apparatus which is incapable of applying the vertical and tangential loads alone as shown in fig 8 a d after shield construction all the tested stresses σ z σ r σ θ and τ zθ agreed well with those calculated using eqs 9 a d thus it can be concluded that the test plan was effectively carried out by using the zju hca 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamic response of soft clay under shield construction and long term wave loading as mentioned earlier for the soil element in soft clay cyclic softening is one of the main effects of cyclic loading this phenomenon is similar to the cyclic mobility of loose sand deposits boulanger and idriss 2007 patiño et al 2013 fig 9 shows the stress strain relationship of the tested specimens at an initial confining stress σ 3i of 100 kpa under the combined action of wave motion and shield construction the slope of the stress strain curve representing the stiffness of the tested specimen continuously decreases as the number of wave loading cycle increases the specimen having a higher ground loss rate δ is more likely to become softened in the course of long term wave loading because shield construction causes significant disturbance to surrounding soil relieving the confining pressure which in turn enlarges the void ratio and reduces the stiffness of soft clay to further illustrate the softening behavior in detail fig 10 presents the dynamic secant modulus e d σ z ε z of the tested specimen in each cycle representing the nominal stiffness where σ z and ε z are the stress and strain amplitudes in a unit cycle respectively the variation of e d with number of loading cycles at different ground loss rates and effective confining pressure is shown in fig 11 for all tested samples e d decreased gradually with increasing loading cycles indicating the softening behavior of soil due to the ground loss and cyclic wave shearing a similar phenomenon was observed by li et al 2011 and leng et al 2017 the softening behavior of soil in terms of degradation of soil stiffness become increasingly pronounced as ground loss rates δ increase at σ 3i 100 kpa when δ was increased from 0 to 10 e d decreased by a further 5 1 to 22 5 and when δ was increased from 0 to 20 and from 0 to 30 the resulting decreases in e d were 26 4 and 32 9 respectively the results also indicate that at lower confining pressure the joint influences of ground loss rate and cyclic wave loading become more significant it can be seen that at σ 3i 100 and with δ 30 the reduction in e d 32 9 was approximately twice of that when shield construction action was not considered 17 4 whereas only a further reduction of e d by around 34 can be observed as the confining pressure increased to 200 kpa this indicated that the disturbance effect weakening the microstructural bonds and fabric of soft foundation is more likely to occur in shallow soil element under the shield construction and cyclic wave motions in addition the above investigations on the soften effect of shield construction and long term wave loading on the soft clay are fundamental and some disturbance factors such as face support pressure in shield construction and softening effect of the wave loading on the post cyclic shear strength of soft clay and k 0 consolidation state for natural soil deposits etc will be addressed in future studies 3 2 mechanical behavior of soft clay after shield construction and long term wave loading a series of undrained monotonic triaxial tests were further conducted to investigate the post cyclic mechanical behavior of soft clay after the combined action of shield construction and long term wave loading a total of 3000 wave loading cycles n were applied in each test with different ground loss rates ranging from 0 to 30 fig 11 shows the relationship between the deviatoric stress i e the difference between the major and minor principal stresses and axial strains at different ground loss rates for tests t10 t11 t12 and t33 all the results for the stress strain relationship generally show a hyperbolic distribution which is in accordance with the triaxial shear test results for marine silty clay wang et al 2019 as expected the initial tangential modulus e i and the peak strength σ 1 σ 3r f of σ 1 σ 3r ε z curves increased with increasing initial confining pressure where σ 1 is the maximum post combined action principal stress and σ 3r is the minimum post combined action principal stress for example σ 1 σ 3r f increased by approximately 50 from σ 3i 100 kpa to σ 3i 300 kpa for δ 0 this is because the initial confining pressure σ 3i is highly dependent on the buried depth the soft clay at a deeper location will be densified by the weight of overlying soil which strengthens its microstructural bonds and fabric as a result both e i and σ 1 σ 3r f of soft clay at higher σ 3i are larger than those at lower σ 3i fig 12 indicates that features of the stress strain curves that is e i and σ 1 σ 3r f varied with the ground loss rate taking σ 3i 100 kpa for instance σ 1 σ 3r f approached 120 kpa for δ 0 however when δ 10 σ 1 σ 3r f decreased to approximately 100 kpa and σ 1 σ 3r f decreased gradually when δ 30 σ 1 σ 3r f reached approximately 80 kpa which is an approximately 1 3rd decrease compared with σ 1 σ 3r f 120 kpa for δ 0 a similar phenomenon can also be observed in the triaxial shear tests on specimens with σ 3i 200 kpa and 300 kpa the above observation can be attributed to the fact that ground loss induced by shield construction significantly contributes to disturbance in surrounding soft clay and reduces the confining pressure subsequently the void ratio of soft clay increases and the inherent microstructural fabric of soft clay is further reorganized which leads to the reduction in e i and σ 1 σ 3r f 4 simple constitutive model considering the softening effect of combined action 4 1 original duncan chang model in general an elasto plastic model has proven to be more realistic in reproducing the dynamic soil behavior including nonlinearity stress dependency inelasticity and plasticity of soil when subjected to cyclic loading however its inherent defect in convergence limits its application in resolving practical problems related to civil engineering nogueira et al 2009 as the most representative nonlinear elastic model the duncan chang model is capable of considering the nonlinearity and stress dependency of soil behavior and provides excellent performance in convergence and thus it has been widely used in the numerical simulation of practical engineering problems franzius et al 2005 yazdchi et al 2006 in the original duncan chang model duncan and chang 1970 a hyperbolic function suggested by kondner 1963 was adopted to simulate the nonlinear stress strain curve of soil as follows 10 σ 1 σ 3 ε 1 a b ε 1 where a and b are constants that are determined experimentally with visualized physical meanings moreover a is the reciprocal of the initial tangent modulus e i and b is the reciprocal of the asymptotic value of the stress difference when the stress strain curve approaches infinite strain σ 1 σ 3 ult kondner 1963 found that the coefficients a and b can be determined more readily if the stress strain data are plotted on transformed axes then eq 10 can be rewritten as 11 ε 1 σ 1 σ 3 a b ε 1 duncan and chang 1970 suggested that a and b can be determined as 12a a 1 e i ε 1 σ 1 σ 3 95 ε 1 σ 1 σ 3 70 2 ε 1 95 ε 1 70 2 σ 1 σ 3 ult and 12b b 1 σ 1 σ 3 ult ε 1 σ 1 σ 3 95 ε 1 σ 1 σ 3 70 ε 1 95 ε 1 70 where the subscripts 95 and 70 represent the values of σ 1 σ 3 equal to 95 and 70 of the peak strength σ 1 σ 3 f respectively as suggested by janbu 1963 the initial tangent modulus e i can be defined as 13 e i k p a σ 3 p a n where k and n are the model parameters the relationship between σ 1 σ 3 f and σ 1 σ 3 ult is established by the failure ratio r f as 14 r f σ 1 σ 3 f σ 1 σ 3 ult according to the mohr coulomb strength criterion σ 1 σ 3 f can be related to the strength parameters c and ϕ 15 σ 1 σ 3 f 2 c cos φ σ 3 sin φ 1 sin φ where c and ϕ are the cohesive force and internal friction angle respectively which can be determined by the drained or undrained triaxial tests of soil at different confining pressures e g 100 200 and 300 kpa then r f can be defined as 16 r f 2 c cos φ σ 3 sin φ 1 sin φ σ 1 σ 3 ult as discussed previously there are a total of five parameters k n c ϕ and r f in the original duncan chang model which can be determined by conducting drained or undrained triaxial tests of soil under different confining pressures however this model is limited to considering the soil response at a certain state e g at an initial state without wave loading or shield construction and it cannot reproduce the degradation of soil stiffness and weakening of soil strength due to long term wave loading and shield construction which are the main features observed in the tests described in previous sections in this study the original duncan chang model is further modified to incorporate the experimental findings as fig 11 shows the dynamic stiffness of the soft clay in terms of the secant modulus e d decreases progressively due to shield construction via δ and long term wave loading via δ however it is not clear whether the post cyclic stiffness e i will follow the similar reduction as e d under the combined action of shield construction and wave loading a traditional method to determine the influence of n and δ on e i is to conduct associated triaxial tests for each loading wave cycle however this method is not feasible owing to the high material cost according to the undrained triaxial test results of the soft clay shown in fig 12 the parameter e i at each confining stress can be determined by eq 12b as illustrated in table 2 the secant modulus e d after 3000 loading cycles is also presented for comparison clearly the ratio e i e d for all three confining stresses is approximately 37 2 which is larger than the ratio of 12 5 more or less for low plasticity silt yasuhara et al 2003 due to the weak microstructure of the soft clay addressed in the present study in other words the softening effect of wave loading on both the dynamic and post cyclic stiffness of soft clay is synchronous which can be attributed to the fact that the disturbance induced by wave loading to the microstructure of soft clay is unique consequently this ratio can be assumed to be applicable to all loading cycles then the associated e i at each cycle can be estimated by amplifying the value of e d by 37 2 as shown in fig 11 in addition the peak strength shown in table 3 under different confining pressures can be obtained from fig 12 for simplicity in the figure the softening effect due to wave loading is not considered here σ 1 σ 3r fsw is the peak strength under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction and σ 1 σ 3r fw is the peak strength under wave loading alone it can be seen that both the peak strength σ 1 σ 3r fsw and its associated reduction rate η σ 1 σ 3r fw σ 1 σ 3r fsw σ 1 σ 3r fw are more positively related to δ under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction compared with the case of wave loading alone moreover η is negatively correlated with increasing σ 3r because of the stress dissipation effect induced by the wave loading along the buried depth 4 2 influence of shield construction and long term wave loading on stiffness equation 13 can also be expressed as 17 lg e i p a lg k n lg σ 3 r p a as shown in tables 4 and 5 the values of parameters k and n can be determined readily using eq 17 and the estimated e i as mentioned above the parameter n is observed to be insensitive to varying n and δ so it can be kept constant n 1 18 during the combined action of shield construction and long term wave motions however parameter k is strongly dependent on n and δ suppose that the variation of k and n with δ 0 may be represented by 18 k t k 0 d ln n 1 where k 0 209 84 is a dimensionless model parameter for the intact soft clay without any disturbance as shown in fig 13 a and d 4 68 is another dimensionless model parameter related to the physical parameters of soft clay e g natural void ratio e and water content w then a new factor a δ is introduced to consider the effects of δ in eq 18 19 k k t 1 a δ according to the test data after a certain time of wave loading e g t 500 t a δ can be calculated by combining eqs 18 and 19 the result is presented in fig 12 b 20 a δ m δ where m 0 50 is a dimensionless model parameter related to the physical parameters of intact soft clay as shown in fig 13 k is greatly dependent on n and δ with both correlation coefficients being greater than 0 99 based on this with the consideration of the combined effects of shield construction and long term wave motions the parameter k can be derived as 21 k k 0 d ln n 1 1 m δ 4 3 effect of shield construction on shear strength as illustrated in fig 14 the values of the undrained cohesion c u and undrained internal frictional angle ϕ u under different ground losses can be determined from σ 1 σ 3 f given in table 3 on the basis of the mohr coulomb criterion in this calculation for simplicity the effect of cyclic wave loading on soil softening in terms of c u and ϕ u is not considered after conducting extensive trial tests on the fitting of the experimental data shown in fig 14 it was found that both c u and ϕ u exhibit a good quadratic relationship with δ which can be derived as 22 c u p a c u0 p a h 1 δ h 2 δ 2 and tan φ u tan φ u0 g 1 δ g 2 δ 2 then 23 c u c u0 h 1 δ h 2 δ 2 p a and φ u arctan tan φ u0 g 1 δ g 2 δ 2 where c u0 and ϕ u0 are the initial undrained cohesion and undrained internal friction angle without ground loss and wave loading respectively h 1 0 23 and h 2 0 30 are the dimensionless model parameters for cohesion which are dependent on factors such as mineral types and soil fabric g 1 0 33 and g 2 0 51 are dimensionless model parameters for the internal frictional angle which are related to factors such as mineral types and roughness of soil particles p a 101 3 kpa is the pressure for normalizing c u fig 14 also indicates that with increasing δ both c u and tan ϕ u decreased nonlinearly moreover tan ϕ u with a 30 ground loss rate decreased by 13 1 in comparison with those without shield construction this is attributed to the fact that reduction of the confining pressure due to ground loss induced by shield construction loosens the soft clay microstructure and modifies the slip and movement between soft clay particles furthermore the void ratio of the soft clay increases and eventually ϕ u decreases zhu et al 2014 a similar trend of reduction in c u can be observed in fig 13 this is due to the breaking of the microstructure of the soft clay due to shield construction 4 4 effect of shield construction on failure ratio the values of σ 1 σ 3 ult and the instant failure ratio r f determined by eq 14 are listed in table 6 clearly r f ranged from 0 91 to 0 99 on average 0 96 is weakly correlated to δ and it can be approximately considered to be constant 0 96 during shield construction 4 5 modified duncan chang model and its verification based on the above discussions it can be concluded that long term wave loading and shield construction will alter the mechanical properties of soft clay including c u ϕ u and k which cannot be covered in the original duncan chang model here by substituting eqs 13 15 and 21 and 23 into eq 10 a modified duncan chang model that considers the softening effect of shield construction and long term wave loading can be expressed as 24 σ 1 σ 3 ε 1 1 k 0 d ln n 1 1 m δ p a σ 3 p a n 1 sin arctan tan φ u 0 g 1 δ g 2 δ 2 2 c u0 h 1 δ h 2 δ 2 p a cos arctan tan φ u0 g 1 δ g 2 δ 2 σ 3 sin arctan tan φ u0 g 1 δ g 2 δ 2 r f ε 1 a total of eleven parameters namely c u0 ϕ u0 k 0 r f n d m g 1 g 2 h 1 and h 2 are covered in the proposed model among these c u0 ϕ u0 k 0 r f and n can be obtained by the traditional undrained triaxial tests which is the same as the original duncan chang model and d m g 1 g 2 h 1 and h 2 should be calibrated by conducting hollow torsional shear experiments to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the developed framework with regards to its capability of incorporating the softening effect of shield construction and long term wave loading the model results are compared with existing measured data obtained from the hollow cylindrical tests as presented in fig 15 to demonstrate the advantage of the developed model the results predicted by the original duncan chang model are also compared the input parameters considered in this analysis are summarized in table 7 the stress strain relationship at any initial confining pressure σ 3i and ground loss rate δ predicted by the present model agrees reasonably well with the experimental data especially at the initial loading stage this is because the present model takes into account the combined softening effect induced by shield construction and long term wave loading by introducing parameters d m g 1 g 2 h 1 and h 2 consequently the stress strain relationship of soft clay at any σ 3i and δ can be well replicated by the present model by contrast the stress strain relationship of soft clay predicted by the original duncan chang model only performed well under the condition δ 0 under any other conditions with δ 0 the predicted results of the original duncan chang model exceeded the experimental results this is because the original duncan chang model does not consider the combined softening effect of shield construction and long term wave loading and thus significantly overestimates the stress strain relationship of clay soil this may result in unsafe design in practical engineering the present model which can reproduce the response of soft clay to the combined action of shield construction and wave loading has wide application prospects in future numerical analysis with respect to various coastal engineering issues such as the construction of coastal power plants however the developed constitutive model effectively reproduces only the post cyclic soil response to post combined action of shield construction and wave loading but not the dynamic features of soft clay under wave loading this will be addressed in future studies 5 conclusions 1 the elementary stresses in hca test σ z σ r σ θ τ zθ under the combined action of wave loading and shield construction was derived based on boussinesq s theory and the assumption of reproducing the ground loss with the relief of confining pressure in equivalent amplitude the hca tests indicate that the stiffness degradation with time becomes increasingly pronounced as ground loss rates δ increases and effective confining pressure decreases which demonstrate that the disturbance effect weakening the microstructural bonds and fabric of soft foundation is more likely to occur in shallow soil element under the combined shield construction and cyclic wave motions 2 the degradation of the dynamic secant modulus e d and the post cyclic initial tangential modulus e i is indicated to be synchronous by the experimental results after 3000 loading cycles the ratio e i e d approximately approaches to 37 2 regardless of confining pressure which indicate the unique disturbance of the combined action of shield construction and wave loading on the microstructure of soft clay considered in this study this triggers an alternative determination of e i at a specific wave cycle by amplifying the associated e d by 37 2 instead of by conducting associated triaxial tests within traditional framework which significantly reduces experimental cost 3 based on the estimated initial tangent modulus e i the sensitive of model parameters k and n of original duncan chang model to δ and wave cycles n were investigated it is found that k decrease in logarithm function with the increase of n for a specific of δ and decrease linearly with the increase of δ at a certain of wave cycles accordingly the empirical relationship between k and δ n was presented however n is independent of both δ and n the influences of δ on the other three model constants c u ϕ u r f were also addressed regardless of wave cycles for simplicity it is observed that both c u and ϕ u exhibit a good quadratic relationship with δ due to the shield construction s negative disturbance to the microstructure of soft clay nonetheless r f is poorly correlated to δ 4 the modified duncan chang model incorporating the empirical relationship between k c u ϕ u and wave cycles and ground loss rate is developed the model results fit well with the experimental data and provide a better prediction than the original duncan chang model this demonstrates the capability of the developed model to consider considering the disturbance to the fabric of soft clay and subsequent softening effect on the macro mechanical parameters k c u and ϕ u etc induced by the combined action of shield construction and wave loading

domain relationship between the wave induced vertical bending moment and shear force and the ship motions sway acceleration pitch angle roll angle vertical acceleration heading angle and yaw rate a mathematical model using a strip theory provides the ship motions data in the frequency domain allowing the validation of the method through simulations keywords artificial neural networks hull bending moment shear force ship motion measurements strip theory 1 introduction in its most basic form a hull response monitoring system hrms is a system that measures and displays key ship motions and hull structural responses by monitoring real time motions and stresses mariners can determine the onset and severity of hull structural response to the sea hull response can be measured either directly by strain gauges or indirectly by monitoring pressures and motions typical for slamming mariners can then initiate ship handling changes course or speed to mitigate dangerous stress levels and other hazards slaughter et al 1997 for the time being the permanent monitoring of the main ship structures can be considered a very important issue because besides representing an important tool for checking the state of the structure during the entire ship s life it also allows to increase the safety levels of the hull while navigating real time information regarding the current status of main parameters of the hull response at sea are in fact provided to the crew and this is a valuable help to the navigation particularly in severe sea states when higher stresses occur within the structures and the risks of a structural failure grow up the requirements that hull condition monitoring systems must meet are regulated by classification societies such as abs 2015 and dnv 2011 these rules specify the configuration and types of sensors to be used as well as measurement uncertainties data storage capacity and functionality hrms capabilities can be extended by measuring recording and analyzing hull stresses in conjunction with other ship motions navigational and performance data extended benefits include fatigue assessment decision rules and guidance to assist the mariner in mitigating current dangers and quantifying design constraints for future ships in its most expansive form an hrms can be integrated with remote assets such as weather prediction to optimize routing vettor and guedes soares 2016 on the basis of hull response ship motion fuel consumption and other parameters slaughter et al 1997 significant research has been conducted in an attempt to estimate hull girder bending moments from ship motion readings theoretically it is easier to estimate the global hull bending moment from wave information rather than from ship motion measurements it is difficult to get accurate wave measurements from a ship during its mission xu and haddara 2001 to that end some techniques are presented to determine wave characteristics from ship motions as for instance the one presented by pascoal and guedes soares 2009 phelps and morris 2013 provided results of a literature and internet survey to determine the state of the art of hrms on commercial and military ships together with discussion of issues related to navy ships generally kefal and oterkus 2016a 2016b presented an application of inverse finite element method ifem to marine structures namely displacement and stress monitoring of a chemical tanker and a panamax containership based on ifem methodology respectively kefal et al 2018 applies the same method to a capsize bulk carrier and investigates an appropriate sensor placement configuration for better structural health monitoring of the vessel the monitoring system presented in this paper is intended to be included in the onboard decision support system developed by perera et al 2012 the objective of this system is to support ship operation in particular on decisions about ship handling in waves which will contribute to vessel safety the prototype system has been set up and installed on board of a ro ro ship and monitors several motion related parameters by processing these data provides the ship master with the information about the consequences of the different ship handling decisions the system is currently collecting data as the ship operates which will be used in its calibration and validation besides the motion measurement related instruments strain gauges have also been installed the time series of the values of the strains at these sensors locations will serve as the basis for the training of the neural network described in this paper capable of quickly and accurately giving the expected loads given the present sea state and possible ship s courses and speeds the system has been successfully tested in terms of hardware and software integration the methodology developed is based on a mathematical model for rigid body ship motions assuming that the ship is rigid and the responses are linear the mathematical model used here is the one proposed by fonseca and guedes soares 1998 based on a time domain strip theory method salvesen et al 1970 to predict the vertical motions and sectional induced loads of ships in large amplitude waves the solution is obtained in the time domain using convolution to account for the memory effects related to the free surface oscillations in this way the radiation forces are linear and represented in terms of impulse response functions infinite frequency added masses and radiation restoring coefficients the diffraction forces associated with incident wave scattering are linear the hydrostatic and froude krylov forces are evaluated over the instantaneous wetted surface of the hull to account for the large amplitude motions and hull flare the linear and non linear terms are used in the equations of motion to compute the motions the system has been satisfactorily compared with experiments as for example in fonseca and guedes soares 2004 this code has been used to produce several time domain responses from a ship in various sea states and with different relative headings between the ship and waves finally the time domain function can be identified using the anns this learning approach is particularly useful in this case because it does not require the form of the function to be specified a priori turning the computational process very fast and able to be implemented in real time in this work a multilayer perceptron mlp is used which is one of the most widely implemented neural network topologies for the network training the backpropagation is employed which is a common method of training anns how to perform a given task simulated data is used to validate the technique taking as basis the m v adee container ship and the m v grande america ro ro the final objective is to implement the system on board the ship mounting one accelerometer in the center of gravity to measure the sway and heave accelerations becoming possible to obtain also yaw rate and pitch roll and heading angle 2 ship motions and wave loads a time domain strip method is used in the present paper to predict the motions and sectional induced loads of the ship in waves the solution is obtained in the time domain using convolution to account for the memory effects related to the free surface oscillations in this way the radiation forces are linear and represented in terms of impulse response functions infinite frequency added masses and radiation restoring coefficients the diffraction forces associated with incident wave scattering are linear the hydrostatic and froude krylov forces are evaluated over the instantaneous wetted surface of the hull to account for the large amplitude motions and hull flare the linear and non linear terms are used in the equations of motion to compute the motions a coordinate system fixed with respect to the mean position of the ship is defined as x x y z with x along the longitudinal direction of the ship and pointing to the bow y is perpendicular to the latter and in the port direction and z in the vertical upward direction and passing through the center of gravity of the ship the origin is in the plane of the undisturbed free surface considering a ship advancing in waves and oscillating as an unrestrained rigid body the oscillatory motions will consist of three translations and three rotations the coordinate system and the displacements are represented in fig 1 although the theory that will be used can be applied for arbitrary headings relative to waves the present work is restricted to head waves for demonstration purposes neglecting the viscous effects the fluid motion is irrotacional and the hydrodynamic problem may be formulated in terms of potential flow theory thus the fluid velocity vector may be represented by the gradient of a velocity potential the time domain formulation derived by cummins 1962 is used to represent the radiation forces in terms of unknown velocity potentials the basic assumption is the linearity of the radiation forces the frequency dependent added masses and damping coefficients are calculated using a strip theory salvesen et al 1970 the sectional hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated using a multi parameter conformal mapping method ramos and guedes soares 1997 which ensures that the resulting added masses and damping coefficients curves are very smooth even for high frequencies the sectional infinite frequency added masses are calculated using a multi parameter conformal mapping technique with a zero potential condition at the mean free surface being imposed the wave exciting forces acting on the ship advancing with constant speed can be separated into the so called froude krylov part which is associated with the wave incident potential and the diffraction part which represents the effects of the disturbance in the incident potential caused by the presence of the ship in the method proposed by fonseca and guedes soares 1998 and used in this work the froude krylov part of the exciting forces as well as the hydrostatic forces is calculated over the variable hull wetted surface under the incident wave elevation for the diffraction part of the exciting forces it is assumed that the ship is advancing through the free surface and restrained at its mean position these forces are linear and calculated applying the haskind newman relations together with a strip theory approach salvesen et al 1970 the shear force at a cross section is the difference between the inertia forces and the sum of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the part of the hull forward of that section in the same way the vertical bending moment is the difference between the moment due to inertia and the moments due to the hydrodynamic forces the hydrostatic contribution from each cross section is given by the difference between the static equilibrium hydrostatic force and the actual hydrostatic force calculated on the exact wetted surface since the ship is a stable system and the radiation forces are linear it is possible to obtain of the motions through fourier transforms with the formulation presented in fonseca and guedes soares 1998 and adopted here the contribution for the vertical shear force and bending moment of the radiation forces may be calculated in the time domain for non harmonic motions taking into account in a proper way the memory effects of the past history of the fluid motion one example of time histories of shear force and bending moment for the adee ship is presented in fig 2 for a sea state with a significant wave height of 2m and a peak period of 18s time histories of sway and heave accelerations roll pitch and heading angles as well as of the yaw rate are presented in fig 3 for a sea state with a significant wave height of 3m and a peak period of 6s 3 neural network training an ann is a mathematical model or computational model that tries to simulate the structure and or functional aspects of biological neural networks anns are highly distributed interconnections of adaptive nonlinear processing elements pes i e they consist of an interconnected group of artificial neurons and process information using a connectionist approach to computation when implemented in digital hardware the pe is a simple sum of products followed by a nonlinearity mcculloch pitts neuron the connection strengths also called the network weights can be adapted such that the output of the network matches a desired response in most cases an ann is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network during the learning phase adaptation is the ability to change the system parameters according to some rule normally minimization of an error function adaptation enables the system to search for optimal performance an ann is a non linear statistical data modelling tool it can be used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data distributed computation has the advantages of reliability fault tolerance high throughput division of computation tasks and cooperative computing the mlp is one of the most widely implemented neural network topologies lippmann 1987 is probably one of the best references for the computational capabilities of mlps in general for static pattern classification the mlp with two hidden layers is a universal pattern classifier in other words the discriminant functions can take any shape as required by the input data clusters moreover when the weights and the output classes are properly normalized the mlp achieves the performance of the maximum a posteriori receiver which is optimal from a classification point of view makhoul 1991 in terms of mapping abilities the mlp is believed to be capable of approximating arbitrary functions mlps are normally trained with the backpropagation algorithm in fact the renewed interest in anns was in part triggered by the existence of backpropagation the least mean squares lms learning algorithm proposed by bernard widrow in 1960 cannot be extended to hidden pes since the desired signal it is not known there the backpropagation rule propagates the errors through the network and allows adaptation of the hidden pes two important characteristics of the mlp are its nonlinear pes which have a nonlinearity that must be smooth the logistic function and the hyperbolic tangent are the most widely used and their massive interconnectivity i e any element of a given layer feeds all the elements of the next layer the mlp is trained with error correction learning which means that the desired response for the system must be known in pattern recognition this is normally the case since the input data is labeled i e it is known which data belongs to which experiment in this work a single hidden layer mlp network is used to the time domain relationship between the wave induced vertical bending moment and shear force and the ship motions an example of a general structure is illustrated in fig 4 there are six input neurons and two output neurons a single bias neuron is added to each of the input and hidden layers the number of the hidden neurons determines how well a system can be modeled it was chosen carefully after some training runs for verification and comparison of results a hyperbolic tangent tanh function is applied to each neuron in the hidden layer providing a network with the ability to make soft decisions the function is defined by 1 f x i w i tanh x i l i n e 2 x i l i n 1 e 2 x i l i n 1 where x i lin βx i with β being an additional parameter that controls the slope and is not adaptive x i are the inputs to the network and w i are the weights between the input layer and the hidden layer the error correction learning works in the following way from the system response at pe i at iteration n y i n and the desired response d i n for a given input pattern an instantaneous error e i n is defined by 2 e i n d i n y i n using the theory of gradient descent learning each weight in the network can be adapted by correcting the present value of the weight with a term that is proportional to the present input and error at the weight i e 3 w i j n 1 w i j n η δ i n x j n the local error δ i n can be directly computed from e i n at the output pe or can be computed as a weighted sum of errors at the internal pes the constant ηis called the step size this procedure is called the backpropagation algorithm details and examples of this algorithm are presented in hush and horne 1993 backpropagation computes the sensitivity of a cost functional with respect to each weight in the network and updates each weight proportional to the sensitivity the advantage of this procedure is that it can be implemented with local information and requires just few multiplications per weight which is very efficient because this is a gradient descent procedure it only uses the local information so can be caught in local minima moreover the procedure is inherently noisy since we are using a poor estimate of the gradient causing slow convergence the disadvantage is that because this is a gradient descent procedure it only uses the local information so can be caught in local minima moreover the procedure is inherently noisy since it is used a poor estimate of the gradient causing slow convergence in order to improve the straight gradient descent a memory term the past increment to the weight is introduced the momentum learning that will speed up and stabilize the convergence in momentum learning the equation to update the weights becomes 4 w i j n 1 w i j n η δ i n x j n α w i j n w i j n 1 where α is the momentum normally α should be set between 0 1 and 0 9 during the training process the backpropagation algorithm uses a gradient search technique to find the connecting weights that minimize a criterion function in this work the criterion function is quadratic cost function which is the most applied cost function in adaptive systems given by 5 j t 1 2 i d i t y i t 2 the error provided to the supervised learning procedure is simply the squared euclidean distance between the network outputs and the desired response 6 ε i t d i t y i t the stop criterion in this work is based in a maximum number of training epochs once the network is trained its weights are saved to a file this allows a convenient interface with which to extract trained network weights to be used by another application or to save the weights of several trials and keep the best results the network saves the best weights the weights with the lowest cross validation error in this work a single hidden layer mlp network is implemented in neurosolutions 5 which is a graphical neural network development software that enables to easily create a neural network model for the required data in the training process six input variables and two output variables are used as referred above for the adee ship the number of hidden neurons of 400 was selected after a careful analysis of the network convergence and generalization capability the set of results obtained using the 400 neurons in the hidden layer was compared with the one obtained with just 10 hidden neurons already presented in moreira and guedes soares 2012 for the grand america ro ro a neural network with just 10 neurons in the hidden layer was considered 4 simulated results simulated data is used to validate the neural network model several runs were performed with a sea keeping code using the m v grande america ro ro the main particulars of the ships are presented in tables 1 2 respectively two pictures of the adee ship are shown in fig 5 and a photo of the grande america ro ro is presented in fig 6 it is considered to be mounted on board one accelerometer in the center of gravity to measure the sway and heave accelerations obtaining also yaw rate and pitch roll and heading angle in the results presented here only simulations of the ship in head waves are considered the results were obtained simulating the ship subjected to random waves with jonswap spectra the frequency range of the wave spectra was chosen to cover frequencies from 0 04 to 0 17 hz in every simulation run the values of the midship bending moment shear force sway and heave accelerations roll pitch and heading angles and yaw rate a total of 300 training points of each input and output were used to train the network corresponding to 300s long random time histories for comparison the number of the hidden neurons was set to 400 at a first stage and to 10 at a posterior phase during the training process 100 points were used as cross validation to evaluate the convergence the correlation coefficient r is computed to determine how well the network output fits the desired output by definition the correlation coefficient between a network output x and a desired output d is given by 7 r i x i x d i d n i d i d 2 n i x i x 2 n the best r values obtained for the estimation of the bending moment for the adee ship are listed in tables 3 4 using 400 and 10 hidden neurons respectively the best r values obtained for the estimation of the bending moment for the grand america ro ro using 10 hidden neurons are listed in table 5 the bending moment absolute and relative error means as well as the corresponding standard deviations for the best r values showed in tables 3 5 are listed in tables 6 8 respectively in tables 6 8 are also presented the values of the bias calculated through the absolute value of the difference between the mean of the whole set of original data for the bending moment and the mean of the respective simulated data data obtained from head waves simulations with jonswap spectra were also used for validating the neural network the mean standard deviation maximum e minimum values of the r values are presented in tables 9 11 it can be observed that an excellent agreement is obtained for almost all frequencies using 400 hidden neurons the comparison using 10 hidden neurons is also made and can be observed that some reasonable results can be obtained using a lower number of neurons however for some frequencies the agreement is not so good but this is expected due to resonance effects figs 7 18 show comparisons between the neural network estimation and the values obtained from the simulations time histories of 125s long are shown and the values of the bending moment are normalized between 0 and 1 the pictures illustrate the very good agreement between the neural network estimates and the results obtained through simulations 5 conclusions a methodology based on artificial neural networks to obtain estimates of wave induced vertical bending moment and shear force from sway heave roll pitch heading and yaw measurements have been developed comparisons were made using different number of neurons in the hidden layer the final neural network model is able to provide accurate estimates of the instantaneous bending moment and shear force the main objective of this technique is to be incorporated into a hull monitoring system future work can include the extension of propagating missing data to make the methodology more robust under extremely scarce data conditions different approaches might be investigated in order to measure the modelling uncertainty of the presented ann the data used to calibrate and validate the neural network model was obtained through time domain simulations using a theoretical method under regular waves in this case the data s quality is better than those measured on board of ships in operation under random seas in future work experimental data obtained through tests on board of ships might also be used to validate the neural network model in order to obtain the most realistic results as possible the presented results were obtained through a seakeeping code the equations of motion are formulated using strip theory considering a constant mean forward speed for a required heading in regular sinusoidal waves it was assumed that the ship is rigid and the responses are linear in case of absence of real data to validate the method irregular waves and a nonlinear model can be also considered since neural networks can easily deal with more complex systems credit authorship contribution statement l

of the ship and pointing to the bow y is perpendicular to the latter and in the port direction and z in the vertical upward direction and passing through the center of gravity of the ship the origin is in the plane of the undisturbed free surface considering a ship advancing in waves and oscillating as an unrestrained rigid body the oscillatory motions will consist of three translations and three rotations the coordinate system and the displacements are represented in fig 1 although the theory that will be used can be applied for arbitrary headings relative to waves the present work is restricted to head waves for demonstration purposes neglecting the viscous effects the fluid motion is irrotacional and the hydrodynamic problem may be formulated in terms of potential flow theory thus the fluid velocity vector may be represented by the gradient of a velocity potential the time domain formulation derived by cummins 1962 is used to represent the radiation forces in terms of unknown velocity potentials the basic assumption is the linearity of the radiation forces the frequency dependent added masses and damping coefficients are calculated using a strip theory salvesen et al 1970 the sectional hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated using a multi parameter conformal mapping method ramos and guedes soares 1997 which ensures that the resulting added masses and damping coefficients curves are very smooth even for high frequencies the sectional infinite frequency added masses are calculated using a multi parameter conformal mapping technique with a zero potential condition at the mean free surface being imposed the wave exciting forces acting on the ship advancing with constant speed can be separated into the so called froude krylov part which is associated with the wave incident potential and the diffraction part which represents the effects of the disturbance in the incident potential caused by the presence of the ship in the method proposed by fonseca and guedes soares 1998 and used in this work the froude krylov part of the exciting forces as well as the hydrostatic forces is calculated over the variable hull wetted surface under the incident wave elevation for the diffraction part of the exciting forces it is assumed that the ship is advancing through the free surface and restrained at its mean position these forces are linear and calculated applying the haskind newman relations together with a strip theory approach salvesen et al 1970 the shear force at a cross section is the difference between the inertia forces and the sum of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the part of the hull forward of that section in the same way the vertical bending moment is the difference between the moment due to inertia and the moments due to the hydrodynamic forces the hydrostatic contribution from each cross section is given by the difference between the static equilibrium hydrostatic force and the actual hydrostatic force calculated on the exact wetted surface since the ship is a stable system and the radiation forces are linear it is possible to obtain of the motions through fourier transforms with the formulation presented in fonseca and guedes soares 1998 and adopted here the contribution for the vertical shear force and bending moment of the radiation forces may be calculated in the time domain for non harmonic motions taking into account in a proper way the memory effects of the past history of the fluid motion one example of time histories of shear force and bending moment for the adee ship is presented in fig 2 for a sea state with a significant wave height of 2m and a peak period of 18s time histories of sway and heave accelerations roll pitch and heading angles as well as of the yaw rate are presented in fig 3 for a sea state with a significant wave height of 3m and a peak period of 6s 3 neural network training an ann is a mathematical model or computational model that tries to simulate the structure and or functional aspects of biological neural networks anns are highly distributed interconnections of adaptive nonlinear processing elements pes i e they consist of an interconnected group of artificial neurons and process information using a connectionist approach to computation when implemented in digital hardware the pe is a simple sum of products followed by a nonlinearity mcculloch pitts neuron the connection strengths also called the network weights can be adapted such that the output of the network matches a desired response in most cases an ann is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network during the learning phase adaptation is the ability to change the system parameters according to some rule normally minimization of an error function adaptation enables the system to search for optimal performance an ann is a non linear statistical data modelling tool it can be used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data distributed computation has the advantages of reliability fault tolerance high throughput division of computation tasks and cooperative computing the mlp is one of the most widely implemented neural network topologies lippmann 1987 is probably one of the best references for the computational capabilities of mlps in general for static pattern classification the mlp with two hidden layers is a universal pattern classifier in other words the discriminant functions can take any shape as required by the input data clusters moreover when the weights and the output classes are properly normalized the mlp achieves the performance of the maximum a posteriori receiver which is optimal from a classification point of view makhoul 1991 in terms of mapping abilities the mlp is believed to be capable of approximating arbitrary functions mlps are normally trained with the backpropagation algorithm in fact the renewed interest in anns was in part triggered by the existence of backpropagation the least mean squares lms learning algorithm proposed by bernard widrow in 1960 cannot be extended to hidden pes since the desired signal it is not known there the backpropagation rule propagates the errors through the network and allows adaptation of the hidden pes two important characteristics of the mlp are its nonlinear pes which have a nonlinearity that must be smooth the logistic function and the hyperbolic tangent are the most widely used and their massive interconnectivity i e any element of a given layer feeds all the elements of the next layer the mlp is trained with error correction learning which means that the desired response for the system must be known in pattern recognition this is normally the case since the input data is labeled i e it is known which data belongs to which experiment in this work a single hidden layer mlp network is used to the time domain relationship between the wave induced vertical bending moment and shear force and the ship motions an example of a general structure is illustrated in fig 4 there are six input neurons and two output neurons a single bias neuron is added to each of the input and hidden layers the number of the hidden neurons determines how well a system can be modeled it was chosen carefully after some training runs for verification and comparison of results a hyperbolic tangent tanh function is applied to each neuron in the hidden layer providing a network with the ability to make soft decisions the function is defined by 1 f x i w i tanh x i l i n e 2 x i l i n 1 e 2 x i l i n 1 where x i lin βx i with β being an additional parameter that controls the slope and is not adaptive x i are the inputs to the network and w i are the weights between the input layer and the hidden layer the error correction learning works in the following way from the system response at pe i at iteration n y i n and the desired response d i n for a given input pattern an instantaneous error e i n is defined by 2 e i n d i n y i n using the theory of gradient descent learning each weight in the network can be adapted by correcting the present value of the weight with a term that is proportional to the present input and error at the weight i e 3 w i j n 1 w i j n η δ i n x j n the local error δ i n can be directly computed from e i n at the output pe or can be computed as a weighted sum of errors at the internal pes the constant ηis called the step size this procedure is called the backpropagation algorithm details and examples of this algorithm are presented in hush and horne 1993 backpropagation computes the sensitivity of a cost functional with respect to each weight in the network and updates each weight proportional to the sensitivity the advantage of this procedure is that it can be implemented with local information and requires just few multiplications per weight which is very efficient because this is a gradient descent procedure it only uses the local information so can be caught in local minima moreover the procedure is inherently noisy since we are using a poor estimate of the gradient causing slow convergence the disadvantage is that because this is a gradient descent procedure it only uses the local information so can be caught in local minima moreover the procedure is inherently noisy since it is used a poor estimate of the gradient causing slow convergence in order to improve the straight gradient descent a memory term the past increment to the weight is introduced the momentum learning that will speed up and stabilize the convergence in momentum learning the equation to update the weights becomes 4 w i j n 1 w i j n η δ i n x j n α w i j n w i j n 1 where α is the momentum normally α should be set between 0 1 and 0 9 during the training process the backpropagation algorithm uses a gradient search technique to find the connecting weights that minimize a criterion function in this work the criterion function is quadratic cost function which is the most applied cost function in adaptive systems given by 5 j t 1 2 i d i t y i t 2 the error provided to the supervised learning procedure is simply the squared euclidean distance between the network outputs and the desired response 6 ε i t d i t y i t the stop criterion in this work is based in a maximum number of training epochs once the network is trained its weights are saved to a file this allows a convenient interface with which to extract trained network weights to be used by another application or to save the weights of several trials and keep the best results the network saves the best weights the weights with the lowest cross validation error in this work a single hidden layer mlp network is implemented in neurosolutions 5 which is a graphical neural network development software that enables to easily create a neural network model for the required data in the training process six input variables and two output variables are used as referred above for the adee ship the number of hidden neurons of 400 was selected after a careful analysis of the network convergence and generalization capability the set of results obtained using the 400 neurons in the hidden layer was compared with the one obtained with just 10 hidden neurons already presented in moreira and guedes soares 2012 for the grand america ro ro a neural network with just 10 neurons in the hidden layer was considered 4 simulated results simulated data is used to validate the neural network model several runs were performed with a sea keeping code using the m v grande america ro ro the main particulars of the ships are presented in tables 1 2 respectively two pictures of the adee ship are shown in fig 5 and a photo of the grande america ro ro is presented in fig 6 it is considered to be mounted on board one accelerometer in the center of gravity to measure the sway and heave accelerations obtaining also yaw rate and pitch roll and heading angle in the results presented here only simulations of the ship in head waves are considered the results were obtained simulating the ship subjected to random waves with jonswap spectra the frequency range of the wave spectra was chosen to cover frequencies from 0 04 to 0 17 hz in every simulation run the values of the midship bending moment shear force sway and heave accelerations roll pitch and heading angles and yaw rate a total of 300 training points of each input and output were used to train the network corresponding to 300s long random time histories for comparison the number of the hidden neurons was set to 400 at a first stage and to 10 at a posterior phase during the training process 100 points were used as cross validation to evaluate the convergence the correlation coefficient r is computed to determine how well the network output fits the desired output by definition the correlation coefficient between a network output x and a desired output d is given by 7 r i x i x d i d n i d i d 2 n i x i x 2 n the best r values obtained for the estimation of the bending moment for the adee ship are listed in tables 3 4 using 400 and 10 hidden neurons respectively the best r values obtained for the estimation of the bending moment for the grand america ro ro using 10 hidden neurons are listed in table 5 the bending moment absolute and relative error means as well as the corresponding standard deviations for the best r values showed in tables 3 5 are listed in tables 6 8 respectively in tables 6 8 are also presented the values of the bias calculated through the absolute value of the difference between the mean of the whole set of original data for the bending moment and the mean of the respective simulated data data obtained from head waves simulations with jonswap spectra were also used for validating the neural network the mean standard deviation maximum e minimum values of the r values are presented in tables 9 11 it can be observed that an excellent agreement is obtained for almost all frequencies using 400 hidden neurons the comparison using 10 hidden neurons is also made and can be observed that some reasonable results can be obtained using a lower number of neurons however for some frequencies the agreement is not so good but this is expected due to resonance effects figs 7 18 show comparisons between the neural network estimation and the values obtained from the simulations time histories of 125s long are shown and the values of the bending moment are normalized between 0 and 1 the pictures illustrate the very good agreement between the neural network estimates and the results obtained through simulations 5 conclusions a methodology based on artificial neural networks to obtain estimates of wave induced vertical bending moment and shear force from sway heave roll pitch heading and yaw measurements have been developed comparisons were made using different number of neurons in the hidden layer the final neural network model is able to provide accurate estimates of the instantaneous bending moment and shear force the main objective of this technique is to be incorporated into a hull monitoring system future work can include the extension of propagating missing data to make the methodology more robust under extremely scarce data conditions different approaches might be investigated in order to measure the modelling uncertainty of the presented ann the data used to calibrate and validate the neural network model was obtained through time domain simulations using a theoretical method under regular waves in this case the data s quality is better than those measured on board of ships in operation under random seas in future work experimental data obtained through tests on board of ships might also be used to validate the neural network model in order to obtain the most realistic results as possible the presented results were obtained through a seakeeping code the equations of motion are formulated using strip theory considering a constant mean forward speed for a required heading in regular sinusoidal waves it was assumed that the ship is rigid and the responses are linear in case of absence of real data to validate the method irregular waves and a nonlinear model can be also considered since neural networks can easily deal with more complex systems credit authorship contribution statement l

21874,an experimental and computational fluid dynamics efd and cfd study of the appended notional submarine darpa suboff fitted with the 7 bladed e1658 propeller and operating near the free surface is presented the flow measurements were taken using particle image velocimetry with a multi camera configuration in the large free surface cavitation channel at inm single phase level set numerical simulations with an overset approach were performed for three advance coefficients j 0 5 0 65 0 82 at three shaft depths z d 1 1 5 2 the results reveal that the presence of the hull and the interaction with the free surface strongly affect the inflow and wake of the propeller producing higher local advance coefficient and blade loads near the surface strong free surface fluctuations at small shaft depth also cause instability and breakdown of the propeller tip vortices in the near field cfd simulations show elliptic instability before vortex breakdown comparison between cfd with efd shows that cfd matches overall trends well mainly for the phase averaged flow field but underpredicts wake fluctuations and thus displays more coherent phase averaged vorticity in addition cfd results also underpredict tip vortex strength and predicts vortex instabilities farther downstream from the propeller plane due to the unresolved upstream turbulence keywords propeller wake tip vortices submarine hydrodynamics near surface operation 1 introduction screw propellers are the main propulsion devices of modern marine vehicles and as such have attracted the attention of researchers and designers to study various aspects affecting performance chase and carrica 2013 dubbioso et al 2013 wang et al 2018 gaggero et al 2019 in particular the propeller wake is of great interest as it exhibits rich vortical structures and flow processes the evolution of vortices in the wake of a propeller is of importance as it directly affects cavitation vibration and noise and has the potential to cause structural problems the evolution of the tip vortices in the wake of a propeller has received considerable attention in recent years as it involves interesting and complex underlying physical phenomena felli et al 2011 muscari et al 2013 2017 jang and mahesh 2013 di mascio et al 2014 kumar and mahesh 2017 felli and falchi 2018 wang et al 2019 several experimental studies have been conducted to investigate wake flow fields associated with isolated fully submerged propellers under various loading conditions di felice et al 2004 used particle image velocimetry piv to investigate the propeller wake under different conditions and examined turbulence diffusion effects in the near field wake instability and the breakdown process felli et al 2006 2008 2010 2011 studied the propeller wake evolution experimentally focusing on wake instability tip vortex breakdown and vortex pairing paik et al 2007 employed piv to study the characteristics of the propeller wake at different blade phases focusing on tip vortex behavior using a galilean decomposition and vortex identification methods the stability of the propeller wake vortex system has also been studied theoretically by some researchers most notably okulov 2004 and okulov and sörensen 2007 who provided an analytical solution to the problem of stability in an array of helical vortices in presence and absence of the hub vortex respectively more recently quaranta et al 2015 2019 studied the instability of a single vortex filament and two interlaced helical vortices assuming gaussian vorticity distributions and axial core flow different instability modes are well captured in the theoretical approach compared with experiments recent developments and improvements in numerical methods and high performance computing hardware have enabled more complex numerical investigations on propeller wake dynamics posa et al 2019 studied a submarine propeller flow in open water condition using an immersed boundary method with highly resolved large eddy simulation les they reported the expected result that the wake dynamics are mainly dominated by tip and hub vortices which are substantially influenced by loading conditions zhang and jaiman 2019 studied the wake dynamics and instabilities of a ducted propeller using hybrid reynolds averaged navier stokes rans les and sliding mesh approaches they found that the elliptic instability is responsible for the mechanisms of the primary stage of tip leakage vortex breakdown kumar and mahesh 2017 investigated the wake field of a five bladed marine propeller under design condition using les they studied instability mechanisms based on phase averaged and azimuthal averaged flow fields and identified a type of mutual induction mechanism di mascio et al 2014 studied the wake instability mechanisms of a propeller operating in oblique flow conditions comparing to the axisymmetric condition and showed that the secondary vorticity and the hub vortex play a key role in the wake destabilization under oblique flow conditions when a ship sails under ballast conditions or a submarine operates emerged the propeller blades get close to the free surface under such conditions the influence of the free surface on the propeller flow can be significant possibly causing ventilation propulsion performance deterioration and vibrations wang et al 2017 paik 2017 studies of marine propellers operating near the free surface mainly focused on thrust loss and ventilation mechanisms see for instance kozlowska and steen 2017 li et al 2015 califano and steen 2011a 2011b and kozlowska et al 2009 in this paper an experimental and numerical study of the notional submarine darpa suboff appended with the e1658 propeller while operating near the free surface is presented work mainly focuses on the propeller wake and influence of the free surface on wake structure and in analyzing the ability and limitations of the cfd approach to reproduce experimental observations 2 case study the study was conducted on a reference suboff propeller system top of fig 1 consisting of a notional submarine hull i e the darpa suboff see e g crook 1990 chase 2012 and a seven bladed propeller see bottom of fig 1 i e the insean e1658 originally designed at insean for open water wake studies designated insean e1619 and accordingly modified to be adapted to the power requirements darpa suboff at the design speed of 2 775 m s in model scale suboff and propeller main characteristics are reported in table 1 a sketch of the propeller and hull is shown in fig 1 3 experimental details experiments were performed in the free surface variable pressure recirculating water channel of the italian national research council institute of marine engineering cnr inm the channel has a test section measuring 10 m 3 6 m 3 m l w h and operates with a water depth of 2 25 m the facility that is suitable for installation and free surface effects investigation on marine propellers see e g calcagno et al 2005 pecoraro et al 2015 presents free stream turbulence intensity levels within 4 and mean velocity uniformity levels within 2 for the axial component and 4 for the cross components relative to the mean axial velocity the suboff model was supported in place by a strut in lieu of the sail as shown in fig 2 top some pictures of the model arrangement in the test section are reported at bottom of fig 2 an extensive set of conditions was originally measured with shaft depths 1 z d 2 upstream velocities 1 u 3 m s and propeller advance coefficients 0 5 j 1 with the advance coefficient defined with the far field velocity and propeller rotational rate n as 1 j u n d these conditions provide a range of submarine reynolds and froude numbers as well as advance coefficients and depth parameters though in this paper we concentrate on the cases with u 1 5 m s and j 0 82 for depths z d 1 1 5 and 2 and with u 1 5 m s and z d 1 5 for advance coefficients j 0 5 0 65 and 0 82 these conditions allow separate evaluation of depth and load effects and are limited to situations that could be measured with piv techniques thus avoiding high load conditions near the free surface where air is entrained piv flow measurements were performed in the wake at the vertical centerplane and extending 3 25d downstream of the propeller a sketch of the experimental set up is shown in fig 3 the illumination was provided by a double cavity nd yag laser quantel twins 200 mj per pulse 12 5 hz repetition rate wavelength 532 nm and a combination of a cylindrical diverging lens 15 mm focal length and a spherical lens 5000 mm focal length the laser was arranged so that the light sheet propagated upwards through a window placed on the floor of the test section the scattered light was acquired by a multi camera recording system consisting of three imager scmos cameras by lavision 16 bits 2560 pixel 2160 pixel 6 5 μm pixel size 50 frames s 1 maximum frame rate each camera was equipped with a nikkor af s 85 mm f 1 4g lens by nikon set at f 8 aperture cameras were arranged side by side in the longitudinal direction with the optical axis perpendicular to the laser sheet this solution already adopted in similar experiments see e g felli at al 2010 felli and falchi 2011 felli and falchi 2018 allowed simultaneous acquisition of a large flow extent without jeopardizing the spatial resolution of the measurement the field of view of the camera system allowed the full coverage of the region of interest the facility water was seeded with hollow glass particles of 10 μm diameter and a specific weight of 1 05 g cm 3 the piv acquisition was triggered upon the passage of the propeller reference blade for a selected angular position this was carried out by synchronizing the piv camera system and the laser pulses to a once per revolution ttl signal supplied by a 3600 pulse s 1 rotary incremental encoder mounted on the propeller dynamometer the synchronization was achieved by a programmable timing unit lavision ptu the phase locked statistical analysis was undertaken over a population of 500 image pairs recorded for 28 even spaced propeller positions in the range from 0 to 350 this choice gave a statistical uncertainty estimated within 0 7 and 6 for the first and second order estimators 4 cfd simulations 4 1 rex the code rex li and carrica 2018 developed at the university of iowa was used for the simulations building on previous experience on propeller and submarine flows including suboff appended with e1619 chase and carrica 2013 onr body 1 martin et al 2015 and joubert bb2 carrica et al 2016 2019 rex is a general purpose cfd solver with a focus on naval hydrodynamics resulting from merging the codes cfdship iowa and magnus both developed at the university of iowa with rex maintaining most of the numerical techniques used in cfdship iowa but adding considerable motions capabilities available in magnus a single phase level set approach is employed to simulate the free surface carrica et al 2007a while motions are enabled by a dynamic overset technique that allows large amplitude body motions and moving surfaces carrica et al 2007b 2010 as well as local grid refinement in this paper the delayed detached eddy simulation ddes turbulence model based on menter s sst k ω model is used menter 1994 the convective diffusive and temporal terms in the equations are discretized with fourth order upwind biased second order central and second order backwards schemes respectively further details of the code modeling numerical approaches and capabilities can be found in the provided references and literature therein 4 2 grid and simulation conditions the calculation domain was discretized using multi block overset structured grids with refinement blocks added to better capture the free surface and the propeller wake table 2 and fig 4 show the overset grid system with a total of 88 8 million grid points the total number of cpu cores used in the cfd simulations was 485 resulting in 183 000 grid points per core including input output one time step takes an average of 21 2 s or 0 12 ms per point per time step in addition 91 cores run the geometric overset component of the simulation see carrica et al 2010 for details for a total usage of 576 cores 25 000 time steps were run for each case resulting in 86 400 cpu hours per case the grid was designed based on two grid convergence studies performed under similar conditions and using the same numerical techniques propeller e1619 the 7 bladed submarine propeller predecessor to e1658 was subject to a grid study for open water operation by chase and carrica 2013 on four grids ranging from 9 3 to 73 4 million grid points and a grid study in self propulsion for joubert bb2 submarine fitted with propeller marin 7371r was performed by carrica et al 2019 with fine medium coarse and very coarse grids with 137 48 6 17 4 and 6 21 million grid points respectively the conclusions of these grid studies were that coarser grids can predict well the forces and moments while the medium grids represent well the main turbulent structures for the submarine lacking the resources to perform a grid sensitivity study for this work we use a grid with a number of blade grid points between the medium and fine grids in chase and carrica 2013 and carrica et al 2019 while the propeller wake refinement is similar to that of the fine grid of chase and carrica 2013 and twice finer than the propeller refinement of the fine grid of carrica et al 2019 cfd simulations were performed reproducing the experimental geometry and conditions but the bottom and side walls of the channel were neglected a reasonable approximation given that the blockage coefficient was less than 2 6 mimicking the experiments results were saved locking blade phase but with a frequency of 14 solutions per rotation the time step was chosen so that the rotor advances 1 513 per step no upstream turbulence was imposed in the cfd simulations simulations were performed for 105 propeller rotations using the last 54 for processing to prevent initial transients from affecting the statistically steady results 5 results and discussion effects of the free surface on thrust and torque are presented first then the effects on the wake are discussed in detail animations of the phase locked cfd solutions for the 5 conditions studied provide a visualization of the flow that helps follow the discussion of results these are available in the accompanying videos video1 j 0 82 z d 1 video2 j 0 82 z d 1 5 video3 j 0 82 z d 2 video4 j 0 65 z d 1 5 video5 j 0 5 z d 1 5 and presented as still images later in

component 5 5 1 thrust and torque thrust and torque were obtained from cfd computations the thrust identity method ittc 2008 was employed to calculate the propeller performance curves in this method the instantaneous advance coefficient j a v a n d experienced by the propeller is obtained from equating the open water propeller thrust also obtained with cfd computations in this work but the experimental open water curves could be used with the thrust obtained for the propeller operating behind the submarine near the surface enabling an estimation of the efficiency at each time step of the simulation since the torque is also known v a is the advance velocity defined as the far field velocity in an open water propeller test v a is then the mean velocity at the propeller plane if the propeller was not present note that thrust and torque coefficients are directly available from cfd computed as a function of thrust t torque q and propeller rotational speed n as 2 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 3 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 as opposed to the open water case the inflow to the propeller is not uniform nor steady due to the wake of the submarine and appendages and to the presence of the free surface this leads to fluctuations in thrust torque and efficiency as shown in figs 5 and 6 for j 0 82 and u 1 5 m s at three depths and three advance coefficients at z d 1 5 and u 1 5 m s notice in fig 5 that the mean advance coefficient resulting from the thrust identity method is much lower than the nominal advance coefficient reaching approximately j a 0 51 0 53 and 0 54 for j 0 82 and z d 1 1 5 and 2 respectively and j a 0 34 0 43 and 0 53 for z d 1 5 and j 0 5 0 65 and 0 82 respectively this indicates that the advance velocity into the propeller is only about 62 68 of the freestream velocity operation near the surface results in propeller inflow changes including higher turbulence levels and less uniform average flow field thrust and torque coefficients decrease with depth as the average advance velocity and advance coefficient increase see fig 6 this effect is accompanied by considerable higher fluctuations in thrust and torque coefficients and advance coefficient when operating near the surface as shown in figs 5a and 6 at z d 2 k t and k q exhibit fluctuations caused mostly by the response to the wake of suboff dominated by the wake of the sail and stern planes at the shallowest depth z d 1 k t exhibits peak to peak variations of over 30 of the mean dominated by low frequency fluctuations with periods around 0 5 1 s free surface effects on thrust and torque fluctuations decay quickly with depth at z d 1 5 fluctuations due to free surface unsteadiness are considerably milder than at z d 1 and closer to the results for z d 2 thrust and torque time variations of smaller amplitude and longer period are present at all depths most clearly at z d 2 and are due to surge free surface elevation fluctuations as expected the rms of thrust and torque fluctuations decrease as shaft depth increases indicating strong fluctuations near the free surface as already discussed in relation to the thrust and torque time histories fig 5 b shows fluctuations of the thrust and torque with advance coefficient at a constant depth of z d 1 5 fluctuations at all considered j values are approximately equal since velocity fluctuations affecting the thrust and torque due to free surface fluctuations and turbulence are only affected by the propeller rotational speed through the stronger propeller induced velocity a second order effect the relative change is expected to decrease mildly as the propeller rotational speed is increased to increase the load or lower the advance coefficient in eq 1 to move to a flatter region of the performance curve however this simple interpretation is not corroborated by the data indicating a more complex interaction between velocity fluctuations and the induced velocity at the propeller the power spectra of the thrust and torque coefficient for j 0 82 at three shaft depths and at z d 1 5 for three advance coefficients are shown in fig 7 an expected strong first harmonic peak is observed around the blade passage frequency corresponding to 51 2 hz for j 0 82 caused by changes of angle of attack as the blades go through the wakes of the sail and appendages by momentum deficit caused by the free surface hull interaction as the top blades interact with the fluctuating velocity field produced by the sail and hull free surface see video1 the result is a wide peak extending approximately 10 hz around the blade passage frequency the free surface hull interaction dominates this effect which decreases quickly with increasing depth see also fig 6 decaying higher harmonics are also present resulting from the staggered interaction of the 7 bladed propeller 51 43 between blades with the weaker wakes of rudders and stern planes 90 between them low frequency fluctuations in the order of 1 10 hz also clear in fig 6 decay more quickly with depth dropping approximately one order of magnitude from z d 1 to z d 1 5 a weaker peak at approximately half the blade passage frequency is also observed in fig 7 since the far field velocity is kept constant at u 1 5 m s changes in advance coefficient are achieved changing the propeller rotational speed the right panel in fig 7 shows that the low frequency response of the thrust coefficient changes little with the propeller load at constant depth but as expected the same peaks observed for j 0 82 and z d 1 5 are present at other advance coefficients but shifted to match the blade passage frequency and higher harmonics interestingly the blade rate amplitudes are almost the same regardless of the depth see left panel in fig 7 which indicates that the free surface affects mostly the broadband components around the peak blade rate components this suggests that the blade rate amplitudes are primarily caused by the sail and control surface wakes 5 2 nominal wake of suboff fig 8 shows contours of mean streamwise and vertical velocity for the wake of suboff without propeller for a far field velocity of u 1 5 m s experimental data is limited to the vertical center plane specifically showing the inflow area of the propeller below the shaft while cfd data is shown in the same plane but also above the propeller profiles of velocity and its rms values were extracted at the streamwise location of the propeller plane marked with dashed lines in fig 8 and shown in fig 9 overall the mean velocity components of cfd results and piv experiments are in good agreement though cfd tends to slightly overestimate the momentum defect in the wake at the propeller location we also note that the grid in that section is much coarser below the shaft than above it see fig 4 as the cfd grid was designed with refinements aiming to resolve the free surface propeller wake and regions near it for this reason cfd is unable to capture the tip vortex from the lower rudder seen clearly in the efd results shown in fig 8 for the vertical velocity but can resolve the one on the upper rudder the momentum defect in the wake is more pronounced at higher depth for both cfd and efd above the shaft on the centerplane only cfd data is available the effect of the free surface is considerable at z d 1 with streamwise velocities at the propeller plane around 0 5 m s and becoming negative upstream near the rudders see that region in video1 the vertical velocity is mostly positive at that depth due to the free surface local upward slope that overcomes the natural taper of the hull shape see figs 8 and 9 and video1 at z d 2 the mean axial velocity profiles are more symmetric about the shaft with some differences caused by the wake of the sail that result in lower streamwise velocity above than below the shaft the magnitudes of rms fluctuations of velocity are harder to capture for cfd while rans simulations fail to produce turbulence in interaction with the free surface ddes loses modeled boundary layer turbulence on transition to les li et al 2018 fig 9 shows rms fluctuations predicted by rans and ddes simulations and both produce rms values of similar magnitude to experiments but showing local deviations respect to efd ddes predicts much larger velocity fluctuations near the free surface than rans as violent flow transients are explicitly solved most notably for z d 1 experimental rms values in fig 9 were corrected subtracting the tunnel free stream turbulence discussed in 3 to display only body and propeller generated fluctuations and better compare with cfd that does not have upstream turbulence 5 3 instantaneous vortical structures fig 10 shows instantaneous views of the simulated wake with vortical structures displayed as isosurfaces of q 30 000 for the three shaft depths at j 0 82 and for j 0 5 at z d 1 5 the vortical structures are colored with dimensionless axial velocity u u at the shallowest shaft depth z d 1 the two way hull free surface interaction is strongest with the unsteady deflection of the free surface presenting a peak about two diameters downstream of the propeller this results in an upward transport of the propeller wake and in a velocity defect in the hull wake that considerably destabilizes the top portion of the propeller wake the local load on the top portion of the propeller is higher as the advance velocity is lower as suggested by the lower streamwise velocity present in that area this is evident observing the tip vortices corresponding to z d 1 in this case the pitch between consecutive tip vortices is considerably lower at the top of the wake than at the bottom the effect is still observable for z d 1 5 though the difference between the top and the bottom vortices is much less marked coloring of the vortical structures shows that the top of the near wake for z d 1 experiences negative streamwise velocities as the shaft depth increases the free surface induced instability becomes weaker and the tip vortices remain stable further downstream of the propeller the sail wake results in additional instability on the upper side of the propeller wake most clear at the deepest shaft position z d 2 the lower side of the propeller wake is considerably more stable than the upper portion but as distance to the free surface increases the effect is less marked vortex pairing occurs approximately three diameters downstream of the propeller and can be observed where the tip vortices leave a gap in the lower wake short wavelength elliptic instabilities on the tip vortices can be observed for all depths starting about one diameter downstream of the propeller plane and growing as the vortices break down for the higher load cases with j 0 5 and j 0 65 at z d 1 5 the elliptic vortex instability is observed closer to the propeller plane as the load increases the advance coefficient decreases growing quickly as the tip vortices evolve downstream significant streamwise vorticity is produced on vortex merging most notably at j 0 5 as the tip vortices evolve further downstream elliptic instability worsens and for j 0 65 leads to helicoidal vortex pairs before vortex breakdown at j 0 5 tip vortex merging is observed earlier but the vortices are already highly unstable breaking down into smaller structures interaction between the free surface and the hull results in considerable turbulence and free surface elevation fluctuations this can be observed most strongly in video1 j 0 82 z d 1 where the free surface is less than a propeller radius above the top of the hull notice that in all videos a translucent level of q 3 000 is used to show the weaker vortices originating upstream of the propeller in addition to the solid isosurfaces of q 30 000 appropriate to display the much stronger propeller tip vortices 5 4 phase averaged flow fields phase averaged quantities of out of plane vorticity ω y streamwise velocity u and vertical velocity w for both cfd and efd at different conditions are presented in fig 11 the initial free surface is located at z d 0 phase averaged quantities also support the previous description of the three dimensional vortical structures for the shaft location z d 1 at j 0 82 cfd results are generally in good agreement with efd though efd results exhibit more diffusion see fig 11 a this higher diffusion is due to more wandering of tip vortices in the experiments possibly caused by upstream water tunnel turbulence absent in the cfd simulations and by under resolved explicit turbulent fluctuations coming from upstream in cfd as a result the phase averaged vorticity ω y in fig 11 a shows more stable tip vortices for the lower wake in cfd extending to x d 1 5 before vortex merging is observed in efd vortex merging can be noticed earlier at x d 0 75 and higher diffusion is observed farther away from the propeller free surface fluctuations in the wake above the shaft mask the tip vortices with very good agreement between cfd and efd the streamwise and vertical velocity components are also well captured by cfd with the already discussed higher diffusion in the lower wake for the efd results the vertical velocity is dominated by the upward tilt of the wake which masks the hub vortex swirl evident at other shaft depths as discussed later the tilt of the wake is most evident in the streamwise velocity and is more marked in efd than cfd in general the agreement of cfd with efd is very good for this depth condition where the free surface is very close to the propeller for cases with the shaft at depths z d 1 5 and 2 shown respectively in fig 11 b and c the influence of the free surface on the propeller wake is considerably weaker the propeller wake tends to be more stable as the depth increases with the top and bottom of the propeller wake looking more similar the phase averaged vorticity ω y still shows evidence of a more stable lower than upper wake at z d 1 5 and to a less extent at z d 2 especially in cfd though differences between upper and lower wake tend to decrease at these depths the decreased effects of free surface fluctuations and hull free surface interaction make more evident the diffusion in the propeller wake not captured by cfd note that the sail produces additional turbulence and a horseshoe vortex that affects the upper wake of suboff resulting in less uniform propeller inflow than in the lower wake chase and carrica 2013 the mean streamwise velocity is less affected by drifting tip vortices and wake and therefore agrees better between cfd and efd however the blade trailing edge velocity deficit is clearly noticeable for cfd particularly for z d 2 but is barely present in efd vortex merging still occurs closer to the propeller in efd than in cfd and for both efd and cfd earlier above than below the shaft this can be expected since turbulent fluctuations cause earlier vortex interaction merging and instability in the propeller wake felli and falchi 2018 to better match the efd results it may be necessary to add synthetic turbulence to the domain inflow boundary to replicate the water tunnel conditions and thus subject the propeller inflow to fluctuations results for the cases with lower advance coefficients j 0 65 and 0 5 at z d 1 5 are shown respectively in fig 11 d and e comparing to fig 11 b as the advance coefficient decreases the propeller wake instability occurs closer to the propeller plane as described in 5 3 a vortex merging process is clearly visible for x d 0 75 in the experiments for the lower wake while in cfd it occurs around x d 1 see also videos 4 and 5 that show clear evidence of pairing but masked by wake instability and vortex breakdown vortex merging on the upper half of the wake is more evident as the propeller load increases both in efd and cfd it is harder to achieve a good match between cfd and efd for vertical velocities since vertical velocities produced by wake and hub vortex swirl and wandering are very strong see right panels in fig 11 small differences in deviation from the symmetric wake will cause large differences between efd and cfd as expected differences between efd and cfd are largest at the propeller shaft axis as the high vorticity of the hub vortex induces high vertical velocities when the vortex axis deviates from the symmetry plane this is the case for efd and to a lesser extent for cfd as can be seen by the profiles of ω y for all conditions in fig 11 phase averaged quantities of reynolds stresses of are shown in fig 12 to further explore the propeller wake dynamics for the condition with z d 1 and j 0 82 shown in fig 12 a the phase locked reynolds stresses are very high in the upper wake close to the free surface as significant velocity fluctuations occur in a point in space in that region due to motions of the free surface and instabilities in the propeller wake as expected the shear stress u w is positive at the top where an increase in vertical velocity lifts the wake and results in a higher streamwise velocity drifting and instabilities in the highly energetic hub vortex cause very large reynolds stresses in its path in particular in w w which is most sensitive to small sideways motions of the vortex in general the agreement of cfd with efd is very good for this depth condition where the free surface fluctuations and hull free surface interactions dominate the flow field evaluation of the cases at z d 1 5 and 2 for j 0 82 show that the reynolds stresses decrease considerably with depth but still remain higher for the upper half of the propeller wake than for the lower section fluctuations around the hub vortex present the largest reynolds stresses higher loading conditions with j 0 65 and 0 5 at the intermediate depth z d 1 5 result in stronger fluctuations around tip and hub vortices and thus exhibit high reynolds stresses in these cases the agreement between cfd and efd is very good though at the highest load condition the tip vortices are better defined in efd see w w in fig 12 e suggesting that the wake instability is overpredicted by cfd 5 5 instantaneous vorticity decay as shown in the previous section the comparison of averaged quantities between efd and cfd can be affected by vortex wandering which makes difficult to distinguish between physical dispersion and diffusion numerical diffusion and averaging artifacts by comparing the instantaneous vorticity averaging diffusion caused by the drifting of the vortices due to large scale turbulence or in the case of free surface flows by fluctuations in free surface elevation can be eliminated from efd results numerical diffusion affecting the decay of vorticity can thus be quantified indicating the quality of the cfd approach for a highly complex flow like the propeller wake fig 13 shows snapshots of the cfd and efd vorticity fields for different conditions while qualitatively the flow fields look similar there are important differences to note at all depths for j 0 82 fig 13 a c the tip vortex paths are more organized in cfd with efd showing earlier instability this is particularly clear at z d 2 where the free surface effects are less important the tip vortices show earlier breakdown in efd than in cfd the instantaneous hub vortex vorticity is much higher in efd than in cfd which predicts larger but less intense vortices notice that the phase averaged vorticity of the hub vortex is well captured by cfd which indicates that the overall circulation is likely well captured but vortices are larger and less intense in cfd as shown in fig 13 similarly local vorticity in the tip vortices is underpredicted by cfd but total circulation is more accurate though the differences between efd and cfd are less marked than for the hub vortex weaker hub and tip vortices can be expected in cfd since the cfd simulations use a ddes approach where in this case the whole propeller wake is in les mode in this condition a smagorinski sub grid scale model adds turbulent viscosity to the system spalart 2009 effectively reducing the intensity of the vortices but in principle properly maintaining circulation numerical dissipation in cfd may also contribute to the problem but may be alleviated with further refinement there are several other possible reasons for the higher vortex instability observed in efd as discussed earlier we speculate that upstream unresolved turbulence from the hull boundary layer and flow around sail and stern planes as well as free stream turbulence levels in the experiment might cause vortex instability that results in earlier merging and breakdown in efd the strength in the tip vortices can also be a cause for the better wake stability predicted by cfd since mutual induction is an important cause of vortex merging and subsequent instability quaranta et al 2019 the higher load cases with lower advance coefficients j 0 65 and 0 5 at z d 1 5 are shown respectively in fig 13 d and e the tip vortex merging process is accompanied by a breakdown mechanism that shows both in cfd and efd as multiple small vortices to evaluate the ability of cfd to reproduce the efd measurements the circulation inside a series of selected boxes with different downstream length but same height is calculated for both instantaneous and phase averaged flow fields lengths from 0 25d to 2 0d in increments of 0 25d are used so the circulation increases as more tip vortices are included in the larger boxes the height of the boxes is 0 16d to guarantee that all downstream consecutive tip vortices are included a sketch of the selected box is shown in fig 14 designed to encompass either the lower or upper tip vortices the circulation is computed as γ s ω y d s fig 15 shows the total circulation as a function of the distance to the propeller plane for the instantaneous flow fields results show that cfd gradually loses circulation with respect to efd consistent with previous observations but the circulation loss is moderate the circulation of the upper vortices is stronger than that of the lower vortices as expected since the blade load is higher in the wake of the sail and closer to the free surface results for the shaft depth closest to the surface are not shown since turbulence and free surface fluctuations make location of the upper tip vortices very difficult and consequently computation of reliable circulation is not possible at shaft depth z d 1 5 where both free surface and sail wake effects are significant more circulation loss is observed in the far field which indicates that the vortices in the efd are more intense and persistent consistent with what was observed in fig 13 at larger shaft depth z d 2 the free surface effects are mostly negligible and the downstream circulation loss in cfd is more moderate circulation as a function of downstream distance to the propeller plane for phase averaged flow fields at different shaft depths is shown in fig 16 in general good agreement between cfd and efd can be observed for the three shaft depths with some deviation farther away from the propeller the differences between the circulation of lower and upper tip vortices decrease as shaft depth increases due to the weaker free surface effects as the propeller gets away from the free surface at the shallowest shaft depth the tip vortex vorticity is stronger and more persistent than for the two deeper conditions in order to further investigate the behavior of the upper and lower tip vortices we record the maximum vorticity of the propeller wake inside a series of selected boxes at all phase locked time steps or images for both efd and cfd results efd results present some high local values in the vorticity field due to uncertainties in piv and the nature of the derivatives used to compute the vorticity to alleviate this we smooth the vorticity fields by averaging with their first neighbors fig 17 shows an example sketch of selected boxes and the out of plane vorticity field for cfd where the size of the boxes guarantees that one and only one tip vortex will be located inside the box for all efd measured images or cfd simulated time steps fig 18 shows the distribution of maximum vorticity for all phase locked efd snapshots on a tip vortex where ω m a x a v is the most probable value of the maximum vorticity for one of the vortices in all instantaneous flow fields in efd it is more difficult to guarantee that only one vortex will be present inside the box since there is considerable additional wandering of the tip vortices and for the closest distance to the surface tip vortices are indistinguishable at some instantaneous snapshots thus boxes need to be large to encompass the maximum vorticity and we assume that the maximum vorticity corresponds to a tip vortex fig 19 shows ω m a x a v as a function of the distance to the propeller plane for the three shaft depth conditions both tip vortices on the upper propeller wake negative out of plane vorticity ω y and on the lower wake positive vorticity are shown and discussed overall the cfd results agree well with the piv measurements for all shaft depths differences are smaller for the lower tip vortices less subject to the effects of free surface and the sail wake the higher load on the upper tip vortices is reflected by higher vorticity most notably in efd for z d 1 5 but also present in cfd at z d 1 the maximum vorticity in the upper vortices is lower than at z d 1 5 see also fig 13 this is likely due to interaction of the tip vortices with the strong upstream turbulence see video1 which results in vortex breakdown and diffusion the higher load resulting from the lower propeller inflow velocity in the wake of the sail and presence of the free surface is accompanied by higher turbulence levels that are unresolved in cfd to better match the experiments a wall resolved les or a hybrid rans les approach explicitly imposing upstream synthetic turbulence mimicking the channel turbulence as well as the boundary layer turbulence may be needed see for instance li et al 2018 6 conclusions experiments based on piv measurements and numerical simulations using the ddes solver rex are performed to analyze the wake characteristics of propeller e1658 operating behind the darpa suboff near the free surface three shaft depths with different advance coefficients were studied the results reveal that the presence of the hull and the interaction with the free surface strongly affect the inflow to the propeller producing a much higher local advance coefficient and blade loads near the surface strong free surface fluctuations at shallow shaft depths also cause instability and breakdown of the propeller tip vortices in the near field at lower advance coefficient the propeller wake instability occurs closer to the propeller plane and vortex merging on the upper half of the wake is more evident while cfd agrees fairly well with experiments when comparing phase averaged quantities and total downstream circulation instantaneous flow fields show that cfd underpredicts tip vortex strength predicts vortex instabilities farther downstream from the propeller plane and lacks explicit turbulent velocity fluctuations incoming into the propeller except for those caused by the free surface future work will concentrate on further studying tip vortex decay and instabilities as well as on imposing explicit turbulent velocity fluctuations with a hybrid rans les approach credit authorship contribution statement lianzhou

21874,an experimental and computational fluid dynamics efd and cfd study of the appended notional submarine darpa suboff fitted with the 7 bladed e1658 propeller and operating near the free surface is presented the flow measurements were taken using particle image velocimetry with a multi camera configuration in the large free surface cavitation channel at inm single phase level set numerical simulations with an overset approach were performed for three advance coefficients j 0 5 0 65 0 82 at three shaft depths z d 1 1 5 2 the results reveal that the presence of the hull and the interaction with the free surface strongly affect the inflow and wake of the propeller producing higher local advance coefficient and blade loads near the surface strong free surface fluctuations at small shaft depth also cause instability and breakdown of the propeller tip vortices in the near field cfd simulations show elliptic instability before vortex breakdown comparison between cfd with efd shows that cfd matches overall trends well mainly for the phase averaged flow field but underpredicts wake fluctuations and thus displays more coherent phase averaged vorticity in addition cfd results also underpredict tip vortex strength and predicts vortex instabilities farther downstream from the propeller plane due to the unresolved upstream turbulence keywords propeller wake tip vortices submarine hydrodynamics near surface operation 1 introduction screw propellers are the main propulsion devices of modern marine vehicles and as such have attracted the attention of researchers and designers to study various aspects affecting performance chase and carrica 2013 dubbioso et al 2013 wang et al 2018 gaggero et al 2019 in particular the propeller wake is of great interest as it exhibits rich vortical structures and flow processes the evolution of vortices in the wake of a propeller is of importance as it directly affects cavitation vibration and noise and has the potential to cause structural problems the evolution of the tip vortices in the wake of a propeller has received considerable attention in recent years as it involves interesting and complex underlying physical phenomena felli et al 2011 muscari et al 2013 2017 jang and mahesh 2013 di mascio et al 2014 kumar and mahesh 2017 felli and falchi 2018 wang et al 2019 several experimental studies have been conducted to investigate wake flow fields associated with isolated fully submerged propellers under various loading conditions di felice et al 2004 used particle image velocimetry piv to investigate the propeller wake under different conditions and examined turbulence diffusion effects in the near field wake instability and the breakdown process felli et al 2006 2008 2010 2011 studied the propeller wake evolution experimentally focusing on wake instability tip vortex breakdown and vortex pairing paik et al 2007 employed piv to study the characteristics of the propeller wake at different blade phases focusing on tip vortex behavior using a galilean decomposition and vortex identification methods the stability of the propeller wake vortex system has also been studied theoretically by some researchers most notably okulov 2004 and okulov and sörensen 2007 who provided an analytical solution to the problem of stability in an array of helical vortices in presence and absence of the hub vortex respectively more recently quaranta et al 2015 2019 studied the instability of a single vortex filament and two interlaced helical vortices assuming gaussian vorticity distributions and axial core flow different instability modes are well captured in the theoretical approach compared with experiments recent developments and improvements in numerical methods and high performance computing hardware have enabled more complex numerical investigations on propeller wake dynamics posa et al 2019 studied a submarine propeller flow in open water condition using an immersed boundary method with highly resolved large eddy simulation les they reported the expected result that the wake dynamics are mainly dominated by tip and hub vortices which are substantially influenced by loading conditions zhang and jaiman 2019 studied the wake dynamics and instabilities of a ducted propeller using hybrid reynolds averaged navier stokes rans les and sliding mesh approaches they found that the elliptic instability is responsible for the mechanisms of the primary stage of tip leakage vortex breakdown kumar and mahesh 2017 investigated the wake field of a five bladed marine propeller under design condition using les they studied instability mechanisms based on phase averaged and azimuthal averaged flow fields and identified a type of mutual induction mechanism di mascio et al 2014 studied the wake instability mechanisms of a propeller operating in oblique flow conditions comparing to the axisymmetric condition and showed that the secondary vorticity and the hub vortex play a key role in the wake destabilization under oblique flow conditions when a ship sails under ballast conditions or a submarine operates emerged the propeller blades get close to the free surface under such conditions the influence of the free surface on the propeller flow can be significant possibly causing ventilation propulsion performance deterioration and vibrations wang et al 2017 paik 2017 studies of marine propellers operating near the free surface mainly focused on thrust loss and ventilation mechanisms see for instance kozlowska and steen 2017 li et al 2015 califano and steen 2011a 2011b and kozlowska et al 2009 in this paper an experimental and numerical study of the notional submarine darpa suboff appended with the e1658 propeller while operating near the free surface is presented work mainly focuses on the propeller wake and influence of the free surface on wake structure and in analyzing the ability and limitations of the cfd approach to reproduce experimental observations 2 case study the study was conducted on a reference suboff propeller system top of fig 1 consisting of a notional submarine hull i e the darpa suboff see e g crook 1990 chase 2012 and a seven bladed propeller see bottom of fig 1 i e the insean e1658 originally designed at insean for open water wake studies designated insean e1619 and accordingly modified to be adapted to the power requirements darpa suboff at the design speed of 2 775 m s in model scale suboff and propeller main characteristics are reported in table 1 a sketch of the propeller and hull is shown in fig 1 3 experimental details experiments were performed in the free surface variable pressure recirculating water channel of the italian national research council institute of marine engineering cnr inm the channel has a test section measuring 10 m 3 6 m 3 m l w h and operates with a water depth of 2 25 m the facility that is suitable for installation and free surface effects investigation on marine propellers see e g calcagno et al 2005 pecoraro et al 2015 presents free stream turbulence intensity levels within 4 and mean velocity uniformity levels within 2 for the axial component and 4 for the cross components relative to the mean axial velocity the suboff model was supported in place by a strut in lieu of the sail as shown in fig 2 top some pictures of the model arrangement in the test section are reported at bottom of fig 2 an extensive set of conditions was originally measured with shaft depths 1 z d 2 upstream velocities 1 u 3 m s and propeller advance coefficients 0 5 j 1 with the advance coefficient defined with the far field velocity and propeller rotational rate n as 1 j u n d these conditions provide a range of submarine reynolds and froude numbers as well as advance coefficients and depth parameters though in this paper we concentrate on the cases with u 1 5 m s and j 0 82 for depths z d 1 1 5 and 2 and with u 1 5 m s and z d 1 5 for advance coefficients j 0 5 0 65 and 0 82 these conditions allow separate evaluation of depth and load effects and are limited to situations that could be measured with piv techniques thus avoiding high load conditions near the free surface where air is entrained piv flow measurements were performed in the wake at the vertical centerplane and extending 3 25d downstream of the propeller a sketch of the experimental set up is shown in fig 3 the illumination was provided by a double cavity nd yag laser quantel twins 200 mj per pulse 12 5 hz repetition rate wavelength 532 nm and a combination of a cylindrical diverging lens 15 mm focal length and a spherical lens 5000 mm focal length the laser was arranged so that the light sheet propagated upwards through a window placed on the floor of the test section the scattered light was acquired by a multi camera recording system consisting of three imager scmos cameras by lavision 16 bits 2560 pixel 2160 pixel 6 5 μm pixel size 50 frames s 1 maximum frame rate each camera was equipped with a nikkor af s 85 mm f 1 4g lens by nikon set at f 8 aperture cameras were arranged side by side in the longitudinal direction with the optical axis perpendicular to the laser sheet this solution already adopted in similar experiments see e g felli at al 2010 felli and falchi 2011 felli and falchi 2018 allowed simultaneous acquisition of a large flow extent without jeopardizing the spatial resolution of the measurement the field of view of the camera system allowed the full coverage of the region of interest the facility water was seeded with hollow glass particles of 10 μm diameter and a specific weight of 1 05 g cm 3 the piv acquisition was triggered upon the passage of the propeller reference blade for a selected angular position this was carried out by synchronizing the piv camera system and the laser pulses to a once per revolution ttl signal supplied by a 3600 pulse s 1 rotary incremental encoder mounted on the propeller dynamometer the synchronization was achieved by a programmable timing unit lavision ptu the phase locked statistical analysis was undertaken over a population of 500 image pairs recorded for 28 even spaced propeller positions in the range from 0 to 350 this choice gave a statistical uncertainty estimated within 0 7 and 6 for the first and second order estimators 4 cfd simulations 4 1 rex the code rex li and carrica 2018 developed at the university of iowa was used for the simulations building on previous experience on propeller and submarine flows including suboff appended with e1619 chase and carrica 2013 onr body 1 martin et al 2015 and joubert bb2 carrica et al 2016 2019 rex is a general purpose cfd solver with a focus on naval hydrodynamics resulting from merging the codes cfdship iowa and magnus both developed at the university of iowa with rex maintaining most of the numerical techniques used in cfdship iowa but adding considerable motions capabilities available in magnus a single phase level set approach is employed to simulate the free surface carrica et al 2007a while motions are enabled by a dynamic overset technique that allows large amplitude body motions and moving surfaces carrica et al 2007b 2010 as well as local grid refinement in this paper the delayed detached eddy simulation ddes turbulence model based on menter s sst k ω model is used menter 1994 the convective diffusive and temporal terms in the equations are discretized with fourth order upwind biased second order central and second order backwards schemes respectively further details of the code modeling numerical approaches and capabilities can be found in the provided references and literature therein 4 2 grid and simulation conditions the calculation domain was discretized using multi block overset structured grids with refinement blocks added to better capture the free surface and the propeller wake table 2 and fig 4 show the overset grid system with a total of 88 8 million grid points the total number of cpu cores used in the cfd simulations was 485 resulting in 183 000 grid points per core including input output one time step takes an average of 21 2 s or 0 12 ms per point per time step in addition 91 cores run the geometric overset component of the simulation see carrica et al 2010 for details for a total usage of 576 cores 25 000 time steps were run for each case resulting in 86 400 cpu hours per case the grid was designed based on two grid convergence studies performed under similar conditions and using the same numerical techniques propeller e1619 the 7 bladed submarine propeller predecessor to e1658 was subject to a grid study for open water operation by chase and carrica 2013 on four grids ranging from 9 3 to 73 4 million grid points and a grid study in self propulsion for joubert bb2 submarine fitted with propeller marin 7371r was performed by carrica et al 2019 with fine medium coarse and very coarse grids with 137 48 6 17 4 and 6 21 million grid points respectively the conclusions of these grid studies were that coarser grids can predict well the forces and moments while the medium grids represent well the main turbulent structures for the submarine lacking the resources to perform a grid sensitivity study for this work we use a grid with a number of blade grid points between the medium and fine grids in chase and carrica 2013 and carrica et al 2019 while the propeller wake refinement is similar to that of the fine grid of chase and carrica 2013 and twice finer than the propeller refinement of the fine grid of carrica et al 2019 cfd simulations were performed reproducing the experimental geometry and conditions but the bottom and side walls of the channel were neglected a reasonable approximation given that the blockage coefficient was less than 2 6 mimicking the experiments results were saved locking blade phase but with a frequency of 14 solutions per rotation the time step was chosen so that the rotor advances 1 513 per step no upstream turbulence was imposed in the cfd simulations simulations were performed for 105 propeller rotations using the last 54 for processing to prevent initial transients from affecting the statistically steady results 5 results and discussion effects of the free surface on thrust and torque are presented first then the effects on the wake are discussed in detail animations of the phase locked cfd solutions for the 5 conditions studied provide a visualization of the flow that helps follow the discussion of

the instantaneous advance coefficient j a v a n d experienced by the propeller is obtained from equating the open water propeller thrust also obtained with cfd computations in this work but the experimental open water curves could be used with the thrust obtained for the propeller operating behind the submarine near the surface enabling an estimation of the efficiency at each time step of the simulation since the torque is also known v a is the advance velocity defined as the far field velocity in an open water propeller test v a is then the mean velocity at the propeller plane if the propeller was not present note that thrust and torque coefficients are directly available from cfd computed as a function of thrust t torque q and propeller rotational speed n as 2 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 3 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 as opposed to the open water case the inflow to the propeller is not uniform nor steady due to the wake of the submarine and appendages and to the presence of the free surface this leads to fluctuations in thrust torque and efficiency as shown in figs 5 and 6 for j 0 82 and u 1 5 m s at three depths and three advance coefficients at z d 1 5 and u 1 5 m s notice in fig 5 that the mean advance coefficient resulting from the thrust identity method is much lower than the nominal advance coefficient reaching approximately j a 0 51 0 53 and 0 54 for j 0 82 and z d 1 1 5 and 2 respectively and j a 0 34 0 43 and 0 53 for z d 1 5 and j 0 5 0 65 and 0 82 respectively this indicates that the advance velocity into the propeller is only about 62 68 of the freestream velocity operation near the surface results in propeller inflow changes including higher turbulence levels and less uniform average flow field thrust and torque coefficients decrease with depth as the average advance velocity and advance coefficient increase see fig 6 this effect is accompanied by considerable higher fluctuations in thrust and torque coefficients and advance coefficient when operating near the surface as shown in figs 5a and 6 at z d 2 k t and k q exhibit fluctuations caused mostly by the response to the wake of suboff dominated by the wake of the sail and stern planes at the shallowest depth z d 1 k t exhibits peak to peak variations of over 30 of the mean dominated by low frequency fluctuations with periods around 0 5 1 s free surface effects on thrust and torque fluctuations decay quickly with depth at z d 1 5 fluctuations due to free surface unsteadiness are considerably milder than at z d 1 and closer to the results for z d 2 thrust and torque time variations of smaller amplitude and longer period are present at all depths most clearly at z d 2 and are due to surge free surface elevation fluctuations as expected the rms of thrust and torque fluctuations decrease as shaft depth increases indicating strong fluctuations near the free surface as already discussed in relation to the thrust and torque time histories fig 5 b shows fluctuations of the thrust and torque with advance coefficient at a constant depth of z d 1 5 fluctuations at all considered j values are approximately equal since velocity fluctuations affecting the thrust and torque due to free surface fluctuations and turbulence are only affected by the propeller rotational speed through the stronger propeller induced velocity a second order effect the relative change is expected to decrease mildly as the propeller rotational speed is increased to increase the load or lower the advance coefficient in eq 1 to move to a flatter region of the performance curve however this simple interpretation is not corroborated by the data indicating a more complex interaction between velocity fluctuations and the induced velocity at the propeller the power spectra of the thrust and torque coefficient for j 0 82 at three shaft depths and at z d 1 5 for three advance coefficients are shown in fig 7 an expected strong first harmonic peak is observed around the blade passage frequency corresponding to 51 2 hz for j 0 82 caused by changes of angle of attack as the blades go through the wakes of the sail and appendages by momentum deficit caused by the free surface hull interaction as the top blades interact with the fluctuating velocity field produced by the sail and hull free surface see video1 the result is a wide peak extending approximately 10 hz around the blade passage frequency the free surface hull interaction dominates this effect which decreases quickly with increasing depth see also fig 6 decaying higher harmonics are also present resulting from the staggered interaction of the 7 bladed propeller 51 43 between blades with the weaker wakes of rudders and stern planes 90 between them low frequency fluctuations in the order of 1 10 hz also clear in fig 6 decay more quickly with depth dropping approximately one order of magnitude from z d 1 to z d 1 5 a weaker peak at approximately half the blade passage frequency is also observed in fig 7 since the far field velocity is kept constant at u 1 5 m s changes in advance coefficient are achieved changing the propeller rotational speed the right panel in fig 7 shows that the low frequency response of the thrust coefficient changes little with the propeller load at constant depth but as expected the same peaks observed for j 0 82 and z d 1 5 are present at other advance coefficients but shifted to match the blade passage frequency and higher harmonics interestingly the blade rate amplitudes are almost the same regardless of the depth see left panel in fig 7 which indicates that the free surface affects mostly the broadband components around the peak blade rate components this suggests that the blade rate amplitudes are primarily caused by the sail and control surface wakes 5 2 nominal wake of suboff fig 8 shows contours of mean streamwise and vertical velocity for the wake of suboff without propeller for a far field velocity of u 1 5 m s experimental data is limited to the vertical center plane specifically showing the inflow area of the propeller below the shaft while cfd data is shown in the same plane but also above the propeller profiles of velocity and its rms values were extracted at the streamwise location of the propeller plane marked with dashed lines in fig 8 and shown in fig 9 overall the mean velocity components of cfd results and piv experiments are in good agreement though cfd tends to slightly overestimate the momentum defect in the wake at the propeller location we also note that the grid in that section is much coarser below the shaft than above it see fig 4 as the cfd grid was designed with refinements aiming to resolve the free surface propeller wake and regions near it for this reason cfd is unable to capture the tip vortex from the lower rudder seen clearly in the efd results shown in fig 8 for the vertical velocity but can resolve the one on the upper rudder the momentum defect in the wake is more pronounced at higher depth for both cfd and efd above the shaft on the centerplane only cfd data is available the effect of the free surface is considerable at z d 1 with streamwise velocities at the propeller plane around 0 5 m s and becoming negative upstream near the rudders see that region in video1 the vertical velocity is mostly positive at that depth due to the free surface local upward slope that overcomes the natural taper of the hull shape see figs 8 and 9 and video1 at z d 2 the mean axial velocity profiles are more symmetric about the shaft with some differences caused by the wake of the sail that result in lower streamwise velocity above than below the shaft the magnitudes of rms fluctuations of velocity are harder to capture for cfd while rans simulations fail to produce turbulence in interaction with the free surface ddes loses modeled boundary layer turbulence on transition to les li et al 2018 fig 9 shows rms fluctuations predicted by rans and ddes simulations and both produce rms values of similar magnitude to experiments but showing local deviations respect to efd ddes predicts much larger velocity fluctuations near the free surface than rans as violent flow transients are explicitly solved most notably for z d 1 experimental rms values in fig 9 were corrected subtracting the tunnel free stream turbulence discussed in 3 to display only body and propeller generated fluctuations and better compare with cfd that does not have upstream turbulence 5 3 instantaneous vortical structures fig 10 shows instantaneous views of the simulated wake with vortical structures displayed as isosurfaces of q 30 000 for the three shaft depths at j 0 82 and for j 0 5 at z d 1 5 the vortical structures are colored with dimensionless axial velocity u u at the shallowest shaft depth z d 1 the two way hull free surface interaction is strongest with the unsteady deflection of the free surface presenting a peak about two diameters downstream of the propeller this results in an upward transport of the propeller wake and in a velocity defect in the hull wake that considerably destabilizes the top portion of the propeller wake the local load on the top portion of the propeller is higher as the advance velocity is lower as suggested by the lower streamwise velocity present in that area this is evident observing the tip vortices corresponding to z d 1 in this case the pitch between consecutive tip vortices is considerably lower at the top of the wake than at the bottom the effect is still observable for z d 1 5 though the difference between the top and the bottom vortices is much less marked coloring of the vortical structures shows that the top of the near wake for z d 1 experiences negative streamwise velocities as the shaft depth increases the free surface induced instability becomes weaker and the tip vortices remain stable further downstream of the propeller the sail wake results in additional instability on the upper side of the propeller wake most clear at the deepest shaft position z d 2 the lower side of the propeller wake is considerably more stable than the upper portion but as distance to the free surface increases the effect is less marked vortex pairing occurs approximately three diameters downstream of the propeller and can be observed where the tip vortices leave a gap in the lower wake short wavelength elliptic instabilities on the tip vortices can be observed for all depths starting about one diameter downstream of the propeller plane and growing as the vortices break down for the higher load cases with j 0 5 and j 0 65 at z d 1 5 the elliptic vortex instability is observed closer to the propeller plane as the load increases the advance coefficient decreases growing quickly as the tip vortices evolve downstream significant streamwise vorticity is produced on vortex merging most notably at j 0 5 as the tip vortices evolve further downstream elliptic instability worsens and for j 0 65 leads to helicoidal vortex pairs before vortex breakdown at j 0 5 tip vortex merging is observed earlier but the vortices are already highly unstable breaking down into smaller structures interaction between the free surface and the hull results in considerable turbulence and free surface elevation fluctuations this can be observed most strongly in video1 j 0 82 z d 1 where the free surface is less than a propeller radius above the top of the hull notice that in all videos a translucent level of q 3 000 is used to show the weaker vortices originating upstream of the propeller in addition to the solid isosurfaces of q 30 000 appropriate to display the much stronger propeller tip vortices 5 4 phase averaged flow fields phase averaged quantities of out of plane vorticity ω y streamwise velocity u and vertical velocity w for both cfd and efd at different conditions are presented in fig 11 the initial free surface is located at z d 0 phase averaged quantities also support the previous description of the three dimensional vortical structures for the shaft location z d 1 at j 0 82 cfd results are generally in good agreement with efd though efd results exhibit more diffusion see fig 11 a this higher diffusion is due to more wandering of tip vortices in the experiments possibly caused by upstream water tunnel turbulence absent in the cfd simulations and by under resolved explicit turbulent fluctuations coming from upstream in cfd as a result the phase averaged vorticity ω y in fig 11 a shows more stable tip vortices for the lower wake in cfd extending to x d 1 5 before vortex merging is observed in efd vortex merging can be noticed earlier at x d 0 75 and higher diffusion is observed farther away from the propeller free surface fluctuations in the wake above the shaft mask the tip vortices with very good agreement between cfd and efd the streamwise and vertical velocity components are also well captured by cfd with the already discussed higher diffusion in the lower wake for the efd results the vertical velocity is dominated by the upward tilt of the wake which masks the hub vortex swirl evident at other shaft depths as discussed later the tilt of the wake is most evident in the streamwise velocity and is more marked in efd than cfd in general the agreement of cfd with efd is very good for this depth condition where the free surface is very close to the propeller for cases with the shaft at depths z d 1 5 and 2 shown respectively in fig 11 b and c the influence of the free surface on the propeller wake is considerably weaker the propeller wake tends to be more stable as the depth increases with the top and bottom of the propeller wake looking more similar the phase averaged vorticity ω y still shows evidence of a more stable lower than upper wake at z d 1 5 and to a less extent at z d 2 especially in cfd though differences between upper and lower wake tend to decrease at these depths the decreased effects of free surface fluctuations and hull free surface interaction make more evident the diffusion in the propeller wake not captured by cfd note that the sail produces additional turbulence and a horseshoe vortex that affects the upper wake of suboff resulting in less uniform propeller inflow than in the lower wake chase and carrica 2013 the mean streamwise velocity is less affected by drifting tip vortices and wake and therefore agrees better between cfd and efd however the blade trailing edge velocity deficit is clearly noticeable for cfd particularly for z d 2 but is barely present in efd vortex merging still occurs closer to the propeller in efd than in cfd and for both efd and cfd earlier above than below the shaft this can be expected since turbulent fluctuations cause earlier vortex interaction merging and instability in the propeller wake felli and falchi 2018 to better match the efd results it may be necessary to add synthetic turbulence to the domain inflow boundary to replicate the water tunnel conditions and thus subject the propeller inflow to fluctuations results for the cases with lower advance coefficients j 0 65 and 0 5 at z d 1 5 are shown respectively in fig 11 d and e comparing to fig 11 b as the advance coefficient decreases the propeller wake instability occurs closer to the propeller plane as described in 5 3 a vortex merging process is clearly visible for x d 0 75 in the experiments for the lower wake while in cfd it occurs around x d 1 see also videos 4 and 5 that show clear evidence of pairing but masked by wake instability and vortex breakdown vortex merging on the upper half of the wake is more evident as the propeller load increases both in efd and cfd it is harder to achieve a good match between cfd and efd for vertical velocities since vertical velocities produced by wake and hub vortex swirl and wandering are very strong see right panels in fig 11 small differences in deviation from the symmetric wake will cause large differences between efd and cfd as expected differences between efd and cfd are largest at the propeller shaft axis as the high vorticity of the hub vortex induces high vertical velocities when the vortex axis deviates from the symmetry plane this is the case for efd and to a lesser extent for cfd as can be seen by the profiles of ω y for all conditions in fig 11 phase averaged quantities of reynolds stresses of are shown in fig 12 to further explore the propeller wake dynamics for the condition with z d 1 and j 0 82 shown in fig 12 a the phase locked reynolds stresses are very high in the upper wake close to the free surface as significant velocity fluctuations occur in a point in space in that region due to motions of the free surface and instabilities in the propeller wake as expected the shear stress u w is positive at the top where an increase in vertical velocity lifts the wake and results in a higher streamwise velocity drifting and instabilities in the highly energetic hub vortex cause very large reynolds stresses in its path in particular in w w which is most sensitive to small sideways motions of the vortex in general the agreement of cfd with efd is very good for this depth condition where the free surface fluctuations and hull free surface interactions dominate the flow field evaluation of the cases at z d 1 5 and 2 for j 0 82 show that the reynolds stresses decrease considerably with depth but still remain higher for the upper half of the propeller wake than for the lower section fluctuations around the hub vortex present the largest reynolds stresses higher loading conditions with j 0 65 and 0 5 at the intermediate depth z d 1 5 result in stronger fluctuations around tip and hub vortices and thus exhibit high reynolds stresses in these cases the agreement between cfd and efd is very good though at the highest load condition the tip vortices are better defined in efd see w w in fig 12 e suggesting that the wake instability is overpredicted by cfd 5 5 instantaneous vorticity decay as shown in the previous section the comparison of averaged quantities between efd and cfd can be affected by vortex wandering which makes difficult to distinguish between physical dispersion and diffusion numerical diffusion and averaging artifacts by comparing the instantaneous vorticity averaging diffusion caused by the drifting of the vortices due to large scale turbulence or in the case of free surface flows by fluctuations in free surface elevation can be eliminated from efd results numerical diffusion affecting the decay of vorticity can thus be quantified indicating the quality of the cfd approach for a highly complex flow like the propeller wake fig 13 shows snapshots of the cfd and efd vorticity fields for different conditions while qualitatively the flow fields look similar there are important differences to note at all depths for j 0 82 fig 13 a c the tip vortex paths are more organized in cfd with efd showing earlier instability this is particularly clear at z d 2 where the free surface effects are less important the tip vortices show earlier breakdown in efd than in cfd the instantaneous hub vortex vorticity is much higher in efd than in cfd which predicts larger but less intense vortices notice that the phase averaged vorticity of the hub vortex is well captured by cfd which indicates that the overall circulation is likely well captured but vortices are larger and less intense in cfd as shown in fig 13 similarly local vorticity in the tip vortices is underpredicted by cfd but total circulation is more accurate though the differences between efd and cfd are less marked than for the hub vortex weaker hub and tip vortices can be expected in cfd since the cfd simulations use a ddes approach where in this case the whole propeller wake is in les mode in this condition a smagorinski sub grid scale model adds turbulent viscosity to the system spalart 2009 effectively reducing the intensity of the vortices but in principle properly maintaining circulation numerical dissipation in cfd may also contribute to the problem but may be alleviated with further refinement there are several other possible reasons for the higher vortex instability observed in efd as discussed earlier we speculate that upstream unresolved turbulence from the hull boundary layer and flow around sail and stern planes as well as free stream turbulence levels in the experiment might cause vortex instability that results in earlier merging and breakdown in efd the strength in the tip vortices can also be a cause for the better wake stability predicted by cfd since mutual induction is an important cause of vortex merging and subsequent instability quaranta et al 2019 the higher load cases with lower advance coefficients j 0 65 and 0 5 at z d 1 5 are shown respectively in fig 13 d and e the tip vortex merging process is accompanied by a breakdown mechanism that shows both in cfd and efd as multiple small vortices to evaluate the ability of cfd to reproduce the efd measurements the circulation inside a series of selected boxes with different downstream length but same height is calculated for both instantaneous and phase averaged flow fields lengths from 0 25d to 2 0d in increments of 0 25d are used so the circulation increases as more tip vortices are included in the larger boxes the height of the boxes is 0 16d to guarantee that all downstream consecutive tip vortices are included a sketch of the selected box is shown in fig 14 designed to encompass either the lower or upper tip vortices the circulation is computed as γ s ω y d s fig 15 shows the total circulation as a function of the distance to the propeller plane for the instantaneous flow fields results show that cfd gradually loses circulation with respect to efd consistent with previous observations but the circulation loss is moderate the circulation of the upper vortices is stronger than that of the lower vortices as expected since the blade load is higher in the wake of the sail and closer to the free surface results for the shaft depth closest to the surface are not shown since turbulence and free surface fluctuations make location of the upper tip vortices very difficult and consequently computation of reliable circulation is not possible at shaft depth z d 1 5 where both free surface and sail wake effects are significant more circulation loss is observed in the far field which indicates that the vortices in the efd are more intense and persistent consistent with what was observed in fig 13 at larger shaft depth z d 2 the free surface effects are mostly negligible and the downstream circulation loss in cfd is more moderate circulation as a function of downstream distance to the propeller plane for phase averaged flow fields at different shaft depths is shown in fig 16 in general good agreement between cfd and efd can be observed for the three shaft depths with some deviation farther away from the propeller the differences between the circulation of lower and upper tip vortices decrease as shaft depth increases due to the weaker free surface effects as the propeller gets away from the free surface at the shallowest shaft depth the tip vortex vorticity is stronger and more persistent than for the two deeper conditions in order to further investigate the behavior of the upper and lower tip vortices we record the maximum vorticity of the propeller wake inside a series of selected boxes at all phase locked time steps or images for both efd and cfd results efd results present some high local values in the vorticity field due to uncertainties in piv and the nature of the derivatives used to compute the vorticity to alleviate this we smooth the vorticity fields by averaging with their first neighbors fig 17 shows an example sketch of selected boxes and the out of plane vorticity field for cfd where the size of the boxes guarantees that one and only one tip vortex will be located inside the box for all efd measured images or cfd simulated time steps fig 18 shows the distribution of maximum vorticity for all phase locked efd snapshots on a tip vortex where ω m a x a v is the most probable value of the maximum vorticity for one of the vortices in all instantaneous flow fields in efd it is more difficult to guarantee that only one vortex will be present inside the box since there is considerable additional wandering of the tip vortices and for the closest distance to the surface tip vortices are indistinguishable at some instantaneous snapshots thus boxes need to be large to encompass the maximum vorticity and we assume that the maximum vorticity corresponds to a tip vortex fig 19 shows ω m a x a v as a function of the distance to the propeller plane for the three shaft depth conditions both tip vortices on the upper propeller wake negative out of plane vorticity ω y and on the lower wake positive vorticity are shown and discussed overall the cfd results agree well with the piv measurements for all shaft depths differences are smaller for the lower tip vortices less subject to the effects of free surface and the sail wake the higher load on the upper tip vortices is reflected by higher vorticity most notably in efd for z d 1 5 but also present in cfd at z d 1 the maximum vorticity in the upper vortices is lower than at z d 1 5 see also fig 13 this is likely due to interaction of the tip vortices with the strong upstream turbulence see video1 which results in vortex breakdown and diffusion the higher load resulting from the lower propeller inflow velocity in the wake of the sail and presence of the free surface is accompanied by higher turbulence levels that are unresolved in cfd to better match the experiments a wall resolved les or a hybrid rans les approach explicitly imposing upstream synthetic turbulence mimicking the channel turbulence as well as the boundary layer turbulence may be needed see for instance li et al 2018 6 conclusions experiments based on piv measurements and numerical simulations using the ddes solver rex are performed to analyze the wake characteristics of propeller e1658 operating behind the darpa suboff near the free surface three shaft depths with different advance coefficients were studied the results reveal that the presence of the hull and the interaction with the free surface strongly affect the inflow to the propeller producing a much higher local advance coefficient and blade loads near the surface strong free surface fluctuations at shallow shaft depths also cause instability and breakdown of the propeller tip vortices in the near field at lower advance coefficient the propeller wake instability occurs closer to the propeller plane and vortex merging on the upper half of the wake is more evident while cfd agrees fairly well with experiments when comparing phase averaged quantities and total downstream circulation instantaneous flow fields show that cfd underpredicts tip vortex strength predicts vortex instabilities farther downstream from the propeller plane and lacks explicit turbulent velocity fluctuations incoming into the propeller except for those caused by the free surface future work will concentrate on further studying tip vortex decay and instabilities as well as on imposing explicit turbulent velocity fluctuations with a hybrid rans les approach credit authorship contribution statement lianzhou
