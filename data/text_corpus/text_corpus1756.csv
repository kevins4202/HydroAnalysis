scbac modified bagasse fly ash mbfa adsorbents 1 introduction nowadays a large amount of waste that has the adverse potential of causing water contamination is being emitted to the environment one of the industries which discard this effluent is molasses based distilleries spent wash is a dark brown color that contributes to the dominant source of most molasses based liquor factories this toxic liquid is removed from the distillation unit during the separation of the fermented mash from ethanol spent wash is well known for its dark brown color and obnoxious odor 1 the appearance of the brown color is due to the presence of a polymeric compound called melanoidin pigment which comprises almost 2 of the spent wash the type of reaction that gives rise to the melanoidin pigments is called maillard or glycation reaction of which reducing sugar and the amino compound is reacting in the absence of any sort of enzymatic activities 2 3 its chemical formula is expressed as c17 18h26 27o10n 4 the degradability of melanoidin pigment has become a concern for researchers due to its polymeric properties and a varied range of molecular weight so the application of biological treatments for treating this recalcitrant compound showed non promising results 5 6 introducing the non remediated spent wash into the water system potentially halts sunlight to enter into the water which affects the photosynthetic process the amount of phosphate and nitrogen content presented in the spent wash can also contribute to the excessive growth of algae that consequently deplete the dissolved oxygen present in the water bodies which in turn results in eutrophication this problem consequently can endanger the whole aquatic life 7 spent wash contains a high amount of organic matter and apart from this it is also rich in carbohydrates organic acids dextrin and lignocellulose materials like lignin hemicellulose 8 9 on average for every litter of alcohol production 15 l of spent wash is discarded 10 spent wash is discharged from the analyzer column operated in the temperature range of 80 90 c fig 1 shows a segment of the distillery industry from fermented mash through the analyzer column to the raw alcohol production line in a particular scenario according to the researcher s observation in one of the molasses based liquor factories found in addis ababa there are approximately 2000 l h of raw alcohol production diversified into different sub products namely as denatured alcohol and liquor for this huge amount of production the removal rates of the spent wash are around 30 000 l h in other cases the fincha sugar factory which has a capacity of producing 110 000 tons of sugar is producing around 8000 m3 of ethanol per year 11 to produce this amount of ethanol a volume of 120 000 m3 may be generated sugarcane bagasse derived activated carbon provides a promising means of treating distillery wastes that pose a tremendous environmental problem sugarcane bagasse is porous remaining material after crushing and extraction of the sugarcane stem 12 sugarcane bagasse consists of several useful constituents including 43 8 of cellulose 28 6 of hemicelluloses 23 5 of lignin 1 3 of ash and 2 8 of extractives 13 a previous study has reported lignocellulose based adsorbents like sugarcane bagasse due to their various functional groups can offer a good attachment of contaminants on its surface 14 these functional groups responsible for the adsorptions include hydroxyl group oh carboxyl group cooh amino group nh2 amide group conh2 and ether group och3 15 apart from the availability of a wide range of functional groups sugar cane bagasse and derivatives are reported to have irregular morphological structure different degrees of porosity 16 and flexibility for chemical modification and treatment 17 researches have shown the potentiality of using sugarcane bagasse and fly ash for the treatment of various chemicals including metals 18 dyes 19 and phenolic compounds 20 and herbicides and pesticides from aqueous solution 21 however sufficient research has not been yet conducted in the removal of melanoidin pigment that is formed as a result of a complex chemical reaction hence the main intent of the present research work is to explicitly compare the removal performance of scbac and mbfa as an adsorbent to effectively remove a melanoidin pigment from the spent wash as they are the dominant solid waste in sugar industries the effect of important operating factors including initial ph initial melanoidin pigment concentration adsorbent dosages system temperature and contact time in response to adsorption removal efficiency of melanoidin pigments onto scbac and mbfa were investigated adsorptions at equilibrium were conducted to extract data relevant to study isotherm models comprising of freundlich and langmuir the adsorption kinetics mechanisms and thermodynamics were also analyzed briefly adsorption on a real waste sample was also further analyzed to study the performance of the candidate adsorbents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a sample of spent wash was brought from bale zaf alcohol and liquor factory addis ababa ethiopia in sterilized polythene bags to prevent the sample from a change in physicochemical properties until the next experimental activities it was directly kept in the refrigerator at 4 c detailed spent wash characterization was conducted as shown in table 1 raw sugarcane bagasse rscb and bagasse fly ash bfa were collected from wonji shoa sugar factory oromia regional state ethiopia bfa was taken from the boiler power plant that is operated around 1000 c the proximate characteristics of the rscb was determined as depicted in table 2 2 2 methods 2 2 1 adsorbents preparation rscb was washed with tap water until no more debris was present which is followed by a soaking process for over 12 h using 0 1 n naoh solutions next it was thoroughly washed with distilled water and simultaneously filtered using whatmangrade 42 ashless filter paper the washed sugarcane bagasse was sun dried for three days after which it was allowed to dry in an oven for 24 h at 105 c the dried sugarcane bagasse was reduced in size using an ultra centrifugal mill retsch zm 100 germany and then it was sieved to the average particle size of 0 75 mm a pretreated rscb was soaked in 20 phosphoric acid solution for 24 h at 105 c with an impregnation ratio of 2 0 after 24 h the impregnated bagasse was then carbonized at 500 c in the furnace for 30 min the resultant activated carbon was thoroughly washed with distilled water until a ph of 7 after that the sample was placed in an oven for 6 h of drying time at 105 c finally the product of scbac was ground to a fine powder and stored in desiccators for further use the impregnation ratio was correlated using equation 1 as 1 impregnation ratio weight of h 3 po 4 in solution g weight of bagasse g bfa was treated with 250 ml of hydrogen peroxide at 60 c for 24 h to remove the attached unwanted impurities next it was washed in three cycles using distilled water to remove the moisture content it was allowed to completely dry at 100 c until the moisture content turns into a constant value finally it was grounded into powder sieved to 200 250 μm and kept in vacuum desiccators until use 2 2 2 preparation of synthetic melanoidin solution the reaction between sugars and amino acids in the presence of high temperatures and low water activity results in a so called maillard reaction that forms melanoidin pigment melanoidin pigment is formed principally by reacting reducing sugar with the amino acid at high temperatures following this synthetic melanoidin pigment was extracted as a representative sample for a spent wash in this experiment synthetic melanoidins were prepared by mixing 1 0 m m of reduced sugar d galactose 1 0 m amino acid asparagine and 0 5 m of na₂co₃ were dispersed in 1 0 l of distilled water and the solution was refluxed at 100 c for 7 h the resulting solid constitute was taken as stock for further solution preparation the synthetic solution containing the pigment was ready as per the initial concentration required in the adsorption process the ph was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions d galactose and asparagine were provided from the food engineering department bahir dar university 2 2 3 adsorbent characterization 2 2 3 1 functional groups the existence of abundant functional groups presents on the active surface of the adsorbent was evaluated using ft ir fourier transform infrared a sample of scbac and mbfa was mixed with dry kbr in the ratio of 1 200 w w and ground in mortal and piston the well mixed sample was placed on a znse crystal and pressed to make a palate then the sample was scanned over a wavelength of 399 193 4000 6 cm 1 by an attenuated total reflection of ft ir 6600 type a jasco model found in bahir dar university the spectrum of ftir was obtained at the scanning speed of 2 mm s with a 4 cm 1 resolution aperture auto 7 1 mm filter auto 10 000 hz and triglycine sulfate tgs detector then the scanned sample was plotted in terms of wavenumber cm 1 vs transmittance 2 2 3 2 crystallinity characterization of scbac and mbfa related to the structure of crystallinity and analysis was carried out using xrd x ray diffraction machine with a designation of minflux 300 600 powder x ray diffractometer rigaco usa the spectra for xrd were collected from addis ababa university chemistry department the apparatus was adjusted with cu tube and with cukα graphic monochromator radiation with λ 1 540593 å and a scan speed of 10 min in the range between 2 theta of 10 70 with a step size of 0 02 the scanned result was recorded in terms of 2 theta degrees vs intensity count 2 2 3 3 surface morphology for the investigation of the morphology of the scbac and mbfa adsorbents scanning electron microscopy sem was found to be a useful instrument the morphological visual structure of the scbac sample was tested by using fe sem fib model neon 40 field emission scanning electron microscope nanomanufacturing technology center nmtc cmti india at addis ababa science and technology university the sem image before adsorption was tested to investigate the morphological and structural characteristics of the adsorbent 2 2 3 4 point of zero charge the salt addition technique was used to analyze the point zero charge of the scbac and mbfa adsorbents an equal amount of solute was added to a series of a solution containing different ph strengths 26 28 0 2 g of scbac and mbfa was dispersed in a 40 ml solution containing 0 1 m nacl solution in a 50 ml beaker for ph adjustment a concentration of 0 1 m of hcl for acidic conditions and 0 1 m naoh for the basic condition was used to tune ph values at 2 4 6 8 and 10 0 2 ph tolerance units the initial ph condition was designated as phi in the end the ph values in each beaker were recorded which is represented as phf during the entire process the samples were shaken for 24 h by using a rotary agitator heidolph unimax 2010 shaker no 542 10020 001 germany at 200 rpm the point zero charges were obtained from the plot of δph phf phi against phi 2 2 4 batch adsorption process the batch adsorption was performed by dispersing a known amount of adsorbents in 50 ml of synthetic spent wash solution in a 100 ml capacity of erlenmeyer flask the mixture was agitated at 125 rpm the experimental design is based on general factorial consisting of four factors including adsorbent dosage 2 3 and 4 g l contact time 30 60 and 90 min temperature 25 37 5 and 50 c and ph 2 6 and 10 the adsorption experiments were carried out at an initial melanoidin concentration of 200 mg l at the final adsorption time interval the supernatant clear solutions in the flasks were examined for final concentration following centrifugation 2 2 5 color removal capacity the decolorizing activity was expressed in terms of the percent removal efficiency by the modified method described previously 29 a perkinelmer uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 35 was used for absorbance measurement and recording of visible absorption spectra fig 2 a shows the uv spectra of synthetic spent wash before adsorption to determine the maximum wavelength decolorization of distillery spent wash was determined by monitoring of decrease in absorbency by scanning the sample at the maximum wavelength λmax 310 nm of each spent wash fig 2 b shows a calibration curve that correlates absorbance and concentration having r2 0 9926 regression coefficient which is close to unity this curve is important to calculate the final concentration after adsorption and later to calculate color removal efficiency the linearized equation that is used to calculate final concentration ct and color removal efficiency is given in equations 2 and 3 respectively as 2 ct mg l absorbance å 0 2364 0 0188 3 color removal ci ct ci 100 where co and ct are melanoidin concentrations in mg l before and after adsorption respectively 2 2 6 adsorption at equilibrium the optimal conditions adsorbent dosage ph temperature and contact time that give the maximum removal efficiency were used to conduct isotherm adsorption experiments at equilibrium in a batch wise operation while varying the initial melanoidin concentration at 210 220 230 240 and 250 mg l the values obtained were plugged in different isotherm models including freundlich and langmuir models for comparison most of the time these isotherm models are recommended when working with adsorption on wastewater treatment 30 and are important to study the equilibrium adsorbate adsorbent interaction 31 the amount of adsorbed coloring material per unit adsorbent g at equilibrium and at some time t was obtained from equations 4 and 5 respectively as 4 qe ci ce m v 5 qt ci ct m v where qe and qt are adsorbent loading at equilibrium and at some time t respectively co and ce are the initial concentration and concentration at the equilibrium of the adsorbate respectively mg g v is the total volume of the solution ml and m is the adsorbent mass g the experimental data obtained such as concentration and adsorbent loading retained on the sorbent were plugged into an equilibrium isotherm model then the best fit model for the sorption system was determined and selected based on the coefficient of determination r2 using the best fit model important adsorption parameters were calculated primarily from the curve s slope and intercept with this relationship it was able to correlate variation of melanoidin concentration 2 2 7 isotherm study 2 2 7 1 freundlich model the principle of adsorbents heterogeneous surface is mainly considered in freundlich isotherm 32 since the freundlich equation is represented as an exponential equation so the concentration of adsorbate on the adsorbent heterogeneous surface increases along with the increment of the melanoidin concentration this isotherm therefore incorporate the principle of adsorbent surface heterogeneity and the exponential dispersal of active sites and their energies as well 33 the nonlinear form as represented in equation 6 is linearized to plot the experimental data into the expression as described in equation 7 6 qe kf ce1 n 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf is constant parameters that show relative adsorbent adsorption capacity in mg g and n is also a constant parameter that shows adsorption intensity the value of n can be seen in three cases of sorption nature these are when n 1 sorption is linear when n 1 sorption is physical and n 1 sorption is chemical 2 2 7 2 langmuir model an assumption of uniform energy distribution on the surface of adsorption is considered during adsorption the other important consideration is that there is no mass transfer of sorbet in the adsorbent plane surface as shown in equations 8 and 9 the nonlinear 34 forms linearized for the development of a linear curve 8 q e q m ce k l 1 cek l 9 ce q e 1 k l q m c e q m where qe is the amount solute loaded per unit mass of adsorbent at equilibrium condition in mg g qm is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g kl is a constant parameter associated with adsorption capacity l mg this parameter is typically varied with surface area and adsorbent porosity this indicates a higher surface area and a better pore volume distribution turns into a higher adsorption capacity 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization 3 1 1 functional groups ftir spectra of rscb as raw material and adsorbents of scbac and mbfa obtained are shown in fig 3 and important adsorptive sites were noted all spectra showed similar peaks in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 the peaks between 500 and 800 cm 1 can be related to ch ch2 and c h stretching vibrations within the aromatic arrangements 35 the respective bands associated with this range are 697 and 621 cm 1 the intensity of this group decreased in scbac and mbfa than rscb this is due to carbon burning and its liberation in the forms of oxidized carbons in the activation and thermal treatment processes mbfa has experienced the lowest peak due to the burning of carbon giving raised to a high percentage of ash the peaks around 1016 to 1101 cm 1 are assigned to c o bonds which may be due to alcohol ether ester or carboxylic acid the corresponding band in this range is 1080 the bands from 1300 to 1400 cm 1 are assigned for no bend respectively therefore the spectra noted in 1374 belong to this function group the band around 1637 cm 1 is represented as cc aromatic skeletal vibration which possibly exists in the lignin aromatic structure the intense peak around 2369 cm 1 revealed a cn which belongs to aliphatic iso nitriles the band between 2700 and 3000 cm 1 characterizes the presence of ch aliphatic axial that is deformed in the constituent of ch2 and ch3functional groups from cellulose hemicellulose and lignin the corresponding identified spectrum is 2925 cm 1 the broad peak that ranges from 3100 to 3600 cm 1 belongs to o h stretching this is due to the phenomenon of oxidation at the surface of treated samples by phosphoric acid from fig 3 the identified characteristic of the oh group is at 3452 cm 1 the weak band around 3747 cm 1 is referred to as the oh band in alcohol or phenol having vibration and stretching band fig 3 also shows relative transmittance values for rscb as compared to scbac and mbfa samples generally from the ftir result it can be inferred that variation of intensities was a result of chemical changes as sugar cane bagasse going through the pretreatment steps and most importantly due to the impregnation of rscb with phosphoric acid and drying processes 3 1 2 crystallinity the xrd patterns as shown in fig 4 show a notable difference between scbac and mbfa a broader diffraction peak at 24 96 and 26 84 degrees were identified for scbac this indicates that the scbac adsorbent was principally amorphous besides the absence of an intense peak shows a mostly amorphous phase nature 36 conversely in the case of mbfa some sharp and intense peak was observed at 2θ around 25 5ᵒ 28 24ᵒ and 50 4ᵒ indicating a crystalline structure this may be as a result of recrystallization of amorphous to crystalline structure burnt at an elevated temperature that can reach up to1000oc for steam production in a steam power plant furthermore the major peaks indicated in scbac and mbfa correspond to the planes for scbac the planes 1103 and 1082 correspond to 24 96 and 26 84 the phases at 26 84 are the representation of cliftonite c and the peak at 24 96 revealed quartz q or sio2 a similar result was reported by previous research work which exhibits broad peak diffraction at 26 53 and 20 68 37 the mbfa sample presented major peaks that are the main characteristics of the mineral phases of quartz and cristobalite this result is in good agreement with previous works where the major peaks experience quartz and cristobalite 38 the major diffraction peaks in mbfa that include 14 23 84 25 5ᵒ 28 24ᵒ 35 34 and 50 4ᵒ corresponds to a crystal plane of 524 635 865 2484 423 and 498 3 1 3 surface morphology evaluation of the photomicrographs for mbfa and scbac are presented in fig 5 a and b as depicted from fig 5 a the occurrence of heterogeneous and highly porous cavities on the surface of scbac with irregular macro pores was identified they have a scattered particle shape and size from fig 6 a the mean pore diameter is approximately 0 603 μm the shapes of the pores are mostly elliptical as shown from fig 5 b mbfa has heterogeneous surface morphology in terms of its sizes and shapes the existence of rough and porous particles is observed with regards to their particle shape fibrous prismatic and round particle shapes can be identified as can be revealed from fig 5 b mbfa consists of a bubble like structure which might be due to high temperature during burning triggers a molten state that creates round pore shapes that previously retained a bubble 39 a similar morphological property was reported in previous research works 40 from the morphological analysis shown in fig 6 b the mean pore diameter of mbfa is approximately 0 105 μm and their shapes are well sorted having very low sphericity comparatively both adsorbents possess porous morphological structure indicating the possibility of attachment of the melanoidin color forming chemicals onto the available holes the morphology of mbfa is relatively defined and well sorted the regularity of the mbfa particle is better than scbac due to the crystallinity phase nature as can be evidenced by the xrd analysis in fig 5 3 2 effects of singular factors on the adsorption the experimental result of adsorption of melanoidin pigment onto scbac and mbfa was analyzed at varied points of contact time overall the removal efficiency for the case of mbfa increased over the entire period of the contact time as can be observed from fig 7 a an increase in percent removal efficiency of pigment from 72 to 81 was observed by mbfa as the contact time rose from 30 to 60 min then the removal efficiency continues to increase slightly to 83 when further increasing contact time to 90 min this is the time when the removal efficiency by mbfa hits the maximum with regard to scbac the percentage experienced an increasing trend from 90 to 91 in the first 30 min though the removal efficiency showed a marginal decline to 90 till 90 min of contact time the justification behind a fast early stage uptake of the solute is because activated carbon initially has a sufficient number of available active sites on its surface however there was no longer be an available site as exposure time is increased as a result even if there is a small number of unoccupied pores the adsorbate might face difficulty to be adhered due to the repulsion force that takes place between the already attached adsorbate and the one in the medium 41 the percentage removal of melanoidin pigment by scbac and mbfa in relation to adsorbent dosage is presented in fig 7 b the influence of adsorbent dosage on percentage removal over a range of 2 4 g l was investigated at fixed ph 6 contact time 60 min and temperature 25 c from fig 7 b the color removal increased entirely for the adsorbents percentage removal rose from 89 to 91 and 77 to 82 with adsorbent dose varied between 2 and 4 g l for scbac and mbfa respectively the maximum percentage of removal reached at a dosage of 4 g l this is basically because of more adsorption free sites created when introducing more adsorbents into the system 42 43 fig 7 c shows how the system temperature of the batch adsorption significantly affects removal efficiency on both scbac and mbfa the temperature of the system was taken over the range 25 c 50 c at constant ph 6 adsorbent dosage 4 g l and contact time 60 min when the temperature of the system increased from 25 c to 50 c the percentage of color removal by scbac plummeted after 25 c 91 reaching a low removal efficiency of 62 1 at 50 c similarly for mbfa it experienced a similar declining trajectory when the temperature increased from 25 to 50 c which corresponded to a percentage removal ranging from 81 to 56 an increase in the temperature of the solution triggers the vibration of the atoms so that the adsorbed species could be detached from the active site and returned to the solution which substantially decreases the removal percentage 44 this is also due to the expansion of the pore as a result of the high energy of activation that imparts the solute to diffuse back to the solution the optimal time for adsorption of melanoidin pigment from the solution is apparently at 25 c for both the adsorbents the effect of initial ph is one of the most decisive factors in the removal of the color because of the interaction force exerted by either h or oh ions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent that potentially could influence the adsorption capacity functional groups available on the surface of the adsorbents are subjected to dissociation when the ph of the system is varied fig 7 c presents the influence of ph on the degradation of melanoidin pigment in a range of 2 10 at a constant adsorbent dose 4 g l contact time 60 min temperature 25 c both adsorbent surface charge and solution ph greatly influence the extent of the adsorption as it can be seen from fig 8 a the higher acidic condition i e ph 6 was favorable for the adsorption of both scbac and mbfa this is due to a low level of competition for an active site that takes place amid adsorbent and ve charges h 45 hence a reduction of ve charges on the surface of the adsorbent favors the condition at a ph of 6 the decrease in potential precipitation and possible ions solubility 46 47 results in the attachment of color forming ions to favor this ph condition as shown from fig 8 a removal percentage over ph range from 2 to 10 was varied from 90 to 89 and 76 71 for scbac and mbfa respectively as ph increased in the acidic region from 2 to 6 the percentage removal of melanoidin pigment by scbac was increased slightly from 90 to 91 for the case of mbfa the effect is intense that the removal percentage increased dramatically from 76 at a ph of 2 and leaped at 84 at a ph of 6 additional rise to ph of 10 results in a decrease in the removal of melanoidin pigment to 89 and 71 by scbac and mbfa respectively noticeably from the experiment the adsorption of pigments of melanoidin by both adsorbents is not favorable in basic media while the interaction is larger at ph 6 as shown in fig 8 b the zero points of charge phpzc analysis was also analyzed for both of the adsorbents the phpzc value where all the surface of scbac charged was 6 8 and for mbfa were 7 2 the surface of scbac and mbfa is positively charged ph phpzc above the value of 6 8 and 7 2 respectively while the surface is negatively charged below the value of the phpzc ph phpzc 48 3 3 adsorption isotherm study the most important characteristic to study the interaction between adsorbents and the adsorbate is isotherm where different adsorption parameters are determined optimized values of the adsorption are used to develop the isotherm models including freundlich and langmuir isotherm models from the plots in fig 9 the required information related to isotherm is summarized as presented in table 3 the coefficient of determination r2 for scbac and mbfa was 0 996 and 0 995 respectively for the langmuir isotherm model fig 9 a and b which looked to be much more applicable than the freundlich model with r2 0 966 and 0 954 for scbac and mbfa respectively since it has the highest difference of regression coefficient of determination for the concentration range considered for the experiment at the equilibrium hence the parameters based on the best fit langmuir model can be explained the ideal localized monolayer model comes to the adsorption phenomena according to which therefore the possible mechanism by which adsorbents eliminate color constituent from solutions are guided by the following mechanisms the attachment of the molecules on the adsorbent surface is at fixed sites in a monolayer only one molecule can be occupied by each site the area of each spot is a fixed quantity determined solely by the geometry of the surface the adsorption energy is proportionate at all spots such behavior on the basis of kinematic consideration is presuming that the adsorbed solutes cannot migrate across the surface of the interaction with other adjacent molecules separation factor rl as shown in equation 10 is a dimensionless constant that is important to define the whether the adsorption condition is favorable 0 r l 1 unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 irreversible r l 0 10 r l 1 1 k l c o from the results shown in table 3 the value of rl is 0 035 for scbac and 0 041 for mbfa which the sorption undergoes a favorable process condition a value of kl of 0 136 l mg for scbac and 0 117l mg for mbfa was obtained which means the given amount was essential for the sorption process to attain half saturation of the adsorbents from the langmuir model the adsorption capacity on to mbfa 14 154 mg g is higher than the scbac 13 966 mg g which might be due to the treatment agent h2o2 used for modifying the fly ash might have increased the surface area 3 4 adsorption kinetics and mechanism models the kinetics of the adsorption is important to be studied since it describes the rate by which the adsorbent uptakes the adsorbate the linearized form of pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations which was shown by equations 11 and 12 was applied to investigate the kinetics of the adsorption the assumption of the models is considering that surface concentrations are equivalent to the concentrations measured the pseudo first order is expressed as represented as 49 11 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 where k1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order min 1 and t is the contact time min a linear plot of log t against log qe qt was developed to determine k1 from the slope of linear plots kinetic data were further studied with the pseudo second order kinetic equation model 50 this kinetic model assumes that the rate limiting stage considers chemisorption that involves the electrons exchange between the adsorbate and adsorbent the fitting of the model is plotted using the expression given below 12 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where k2is the rate constant of pseudo second order rate constant min 1 data of t against t qt was plotted to determine k2 the linear curve obtained for the different kinetic models are depicted in fig 10 the kinetic parameters that are important for the determination of values to analyze the adsorption of melanoidin pigment by scbac and mbfa are summarized in table 4 from the results the pseudo second order model provides the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 9999 for both adsorbents while pseudo first order provides a correlation coefficient of r2 0 9237 and 0 8871 for scbac and mbfa respectively previous research indicated that chemisorption results in rate limiting steps by involving valence forces via electrons exchange between the adsorbent and adsorbate 51 intraparticle diffusion was treated as an additional kinetic model to further examine the mechanism of the process the linearized relation for intraparticle diffusion is proposed by weber and morris and is described by equation 13 52 13 qt kidt1 2 c where kid is the rate constant for intraparticle diffusion min 0 5 c is the constant value related to boundary layer thickness mg g the experimental data were fitted t1 2 versus qt with the linearized intraparticle diffusion model plot as can be depicted in fig 11 from the result it can be noticed that a bi linear portion includes one slanted and the other constant portion this phenomenon suggests that two mechanisms occurred simultaneously during the adsorption process this might be due to the variance in the early and final stages of mass transfer rate that occurred in the adsorption 53 the values of kid and correlation coefficient c are given in table 4 3 5 adsorption thermodynamics the change in the values of parameters obtained from the thermodynamics study reveals the degree of the spontaneity of the adsorption during the experiment the adsorption was performed at a temperature of 303 323 343 and 363 k the negative and positive values of δgo imply that the adsorption is a spontaneous and nonspontaneous process respectively 54 exothermic and the endothermic nature of the adsorption process can also be determined from the thermodynamic study these fundamental thermodynamic properties are correlated as described in equation 14 14 δgo δho tδs where δgo is the standard free energy change kj mol δho is the enthalpy changes kj mol t is the solution temperature ok and δsois entropy change kj mol k δgo can also be expressed in equation 15 as described by the van t hoff equation 15 δgo rt ln kc equation 16 is the linearized form of van t hoff that yields a plot of 1 t vs ln k c which is important to determine δho and δso r is the gas constant with the value of 8 314 j mol k kc is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant l g which is expressed in terms of qe which is the amount of melanoidin pigment adsorbed on the sorbent mass mg g at equilibrium and ce which is an equilibrium concentration mg l 16 ln kc δ s o r δ h o rt 17 kc qe ce table 5 shows the calculated thermodynamic parameters obtained from the slope and intercepts values of the scbac and mbfa graphs as shown in fig 12 a and b a result indicates δho with values of 29 418 kj mol and 23 898 kj mol for scbac and mbfa respectively the negative value reflects that the reaction is a purely exothermic process for both adsorbents from this it is apparent to note that the adsorption is preferred higher removal efficiency at a lower temperature which in turn implies that the adsorption is exothermic δho also indicates whether the interaction of the adsorbent and adsorbate is due to physical or chemically binding forces a previous study has estimated that the parameter limit for thermodynamic that suggests the heat of adsorption is less than 80 kj mol is physisorption 55 furthermore when the heat of adsorption is less than 40 kj mol the adsorption followed the ion exchange between adsorbent and adsorbate accordingly from the result shown in table 5 it is clear that the heat of adsorption for the adsorbents is less than the limit specified so δhoin the process of removal of melanoidin pigment by scbac and mbfa is physisorption and the attachment is guided by ion exchange with regard to δs indicated the degree of disorderliness of the melanoidin pigment attachment onto scbac and mbfa during the adsorption process from the result the entropy value for scbac and mbfa was 0 105 and 0 089 kj mol k δs with a negative value indicates an adsorbent without a significant alteration in the structure as a result of the adsorption process comparatively mbfa shows a lesser disorder value that might be attributed to the crystalline nature of mbfa as the temperature rose in the solution a decrease in the value of δgo was observed which defines the adsorbents are feasible and spontaneous as well feasibility is an important term as it indicates the potential of adsorbent reusability 3 6 adsorption on real spent wash the optimized adsorption parameters conducted on the synthetic spent wash were applied to the real spent wash from table 6 it is clear that there is significant color degradation by scbac and mbfa on real waste the performance of scbac and mbfa for the removal of melanoidin pigment on the real spent wash sample and the synthetic spent wash solution was comparable with only 0 71 and 0 96 of deviation for scbac and mbfa respectively the higher removal efficiency was recorded for scbac 90 3 3 7 comparison of adsorption capacity and removal efficiency table 7 compares the color removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity of scbac and mbfa with different adsorbent materials for the melanoidin pigment removal from molasses based spent wash 4 conclusion in conclusion the possibility of degrading recalcitrant melanoidin pigment from spent wash was proven as revealed from the characterization the synthesized scbac was amorphous having a macro porous morphological structure with a varying functional group on the active sites mbfa showed similar functional groups with a lower percent transmittance and a complete crystalline structure was found out during the adoption process three level four factors adsorbent dosage mg contact time min initial ph and temperature oc were varied to achieve the maximum possible removal efficiency based on the results of the analysis the removal efficiency of melanoidin color was affected by the process parameters the pronounced effect was noticed by the variation of system temperature of the adsorption for both adsorbent types the maximum melanoidin color removal percentage by the scbac on the synthetic spent wash and real spent wash was 90 and 91 respectively which was obtained at the optimum process conditions of adsorbent dosage 4 g l contact time 60 min initial ph 6 and temperature 25 c conversely in the case of mbfa the maximum removal efficiency on synthetic and real spent wash was 82 54 and 81 2 respectively at optimal process conditions of adsorbent dosage 4 g l contact time 90 min initial ph 6 and temperature 25 c results from equilibrium and kinetic data resulted in the best fit on langmuir and pseudo second order for both adsorbents the mechanism of the adsorption was analyzed using the intraparticle diffusion model that shows bilinear adsorption stages from the thermodynamics study it was able to note that the adsorption system for melanoidin color onto scbac and mbfa was exothermic physisorption and the mode of the adsorption is guided by ion exchange it was also noted that the adsorption process was spontaneous funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 5 conflictsof interest the author declares that he has

8780,following the expansion of distillery industries a large quantity of waste is being released to the environment containing high color forming chemicals this study aimed at degrading melanoidin pigment from distillery spent wash by using impregnated sugarcane bagasse activated carbon scbac and modified bagasse fly ash mbfa as a comparative study ftir has revealed functional groups responsible for adsorption a broad peak revealing an amorphous structure was observed for scbac while crystalline structure was observed in mbfa using xrd sem micrograph revealed an irregular macro porous structure and regular structure for scbac and mbfa respectively in the adsorption important process parameters were optimized in response to color removal efficiency at equilibrium adsorption isotherm models kinetics mechanisms and thermodynamics of the adsorption were studied langmuir model and pseudo second order result in the best fit for both adsorbents thermodynamics study revealed an exothermic process feasibility and spontaneity of the adsorption process for both adsorbents graphical abstract image 1 keywords distillery spent wash melanoidin sugar cane bagasse activated carbon scbac modified bagasse fly ash mbfa adsorbents 1 introduction nowadays a large amount of waste that has the adverse potential of causing water contamination is being emitted to the environment one of the industries which discard this effluent is molasses based distilleries spent wash is a dark brown color that contributes to the dominant source of most molasses based liquor factories this toxic liquid is removed from the distillation unit during the separation of the fermented mash from ethanol spent wash is well known for its dark brown color and obnoxious odor 1 the appearance of the brown color is due to the presence of a polymeric compound called melanoidin pigment which comprises almost 2 of the spent wash the type of reaction that gives rise to the melanoidin pigments is called maillard or glycation reaction of which reducing sugar and the amino compound is reacting in the absence of any sort of enzymatic activities 2 3 its chemical formula is expressed as c17 18h26 27o10n 4 the degradability of melanoidin pigment has become a concern for researchers due to its polymeric properties and a varied range of molecular weight so the application of biological treatments for treating this recalcitrant compound showed non promising results 5 6 introducing the non remediated spent wash into the water system potentially halts sunlight to enter into the water which affects the photosynthetic process the amount of phosphate and nitrogen content presented in the spent wash can also contribute to the excessive growth of algae that consequently deplete the dissolved oxygen present in the water bodies which in turn results in eutrophication this problem consequently can endanger the whole aquatic life 7 spent wash contains a high amount of organic matter and apart from this it is also rich in carbohydrates organic acids dextrin and lignocellulose materials like lignin hemicellulose 8 9 on average for every litter of alcohol production 15 l of spent wash is discarded 10 spent wash is discharged from the analyzer column operated in the temperature range of 80 90 c fig 1 shows a segment of the distillery industry from fermented mash through the analyzer column to the raw alcohol production line in a particular scenario according to the researcher s observation in one of the molasses based liquor factories found in addis ababa there are approximately 2000 l h of raw alcohol production diversified into different sub products namely as denatured alcohol and liquor for this huge amount of production the removal rates of the spent wash are around 30 000 l h in other cases the fincha sugar factory which has a capacity of producing 110 000 tons of sugar is producing around 8000 m3 of ethanol per year 11 to produce this amount of ethanol a volume of 120 000 m3 may be generated sugarcane bagasse derived activated carbon provides a promising means of treating distillery wastes that pose a tremendous environmental problem sugarcane bagasse is porous remaining material after crushing and extraction of the sugarcane stem 12 sugarcane bagasse consists of several useful constituents including 43 8 of cellulose 28 6 of hemicelluloses 23 5 of lignin 1 3 of ash and 2 8 of extractives 13 a previous study has reported lignocellulose based adsorbents like sugarcane bagasse due to their various functional groups can offer a good attachment of contaminants on its surface 14 these functional groups responsible for the adsorptions include hydroxyl group oh carboxyl group cooh amino group nh2 amide group conh2 and ether group och3 15 apart from the availability of a wide range of functional groups sugar cane bagasse and derivatives are reported to have irregular morphological structure different degrees of porosity 16 and flexibility for chemical modification and treatment 17 researches have shown the potentiality of using sugarcane bagasse and fly ash for the treatment of various chemicals including metals 18 dyes 19 and phenolic compounds 20 and herbicides and pesticides from aqueous solution 21 however sufficient research has not been yet conducted in the removal of melanoidin pigment that is formed as a result of a complex chemical reaction hence the main intent of the present research work is to explicitly compare the removal performance of scbac and mbfa as an adsorbent to effectively remove a melanoidin pigment from the spent wash as they are the dominant solid waste in sugar industries the effect of important operating factors including initial ph initial melanoidin pigment concentration adsorbent dosages system temperature and contact time in response to adsorption removal efficiency of melanoidin pigments onto scbac and mbfa were investigated adsorptions at equilibrium were conducted to extract data relevant to study isotherm models comprising of freundlich and langmuir the adsorption kinetics mechanisms and thermodynamics were also analyzed briefly adsorption on a real waste sample was also further analyzed to study the performance of the candidate adsorbents 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a sample of spent wash was brought from bale zaf alcohol and liquor factory addis ababa ethiopia in sterilized polythene bags to prevent the sample from a change in physicochemical properties until the next experimental activities it was directly kept in the refrigerator at 4 c detailed spent wash characterization was conducted as shown in table 1 raw sugarcane bagasse rscb and bagasse fly ash bfa were collected from wonji shoa sugar factory oromia regional state ethiopia bfa was taken from the boiler power plant that is operated around 1000 c the proximate characteristics of the rscb was determined as depicted in table 2 2 2 methods 2 2 1 adsorbents preparation rscb was washed with tap water until no more debris was present which is followed by a soaking process for over 12 h using 0 1 n naoh solutions next it was thoroughly washed with distilled water and simultaneously filtered using whatmangrade 42 ashless filter paper the washed sugarcane bagasse was sun dried for three days after which it was allowed to dry in an oven for 24 h at 105 c the dried sugarcane bagasse was reduced in size using an ultra centrifugal mill retsch zm 100 germany and then it was sieved to the average particle size of 0 75 mm a pretreated rscb was soaked in 20 phosphoric acid solution for 24 h at 105 c with an impregnation ratio of 2 0 after 24 h the impregnated bagasse was then carbonized at 500 c in the furnace for 30 min the resultant activated carbon was thoroughly washed with distilled water until a ph of 7 after that the sample was placed in an oven for 6 h of drying time at 105 c finally the product of scbac was ground to a fine powder and stored in desiccators for further use the impregnation ratio was correlated using equation 1 as 1 impregnation ratio weight of h 3 po 4 in solution g weight of bagasse g bfa was treated with 250 ml of hydrogen peroxide at 60 c for 24 h to remove the attached unwanted impurities next it was washed in three cycles using distilled water to remove the moisture content it was allowed to completely dry at 100 c until the moisture content turns into a constant value finally it was grounded into powder sieved to 200 250 μm and kept in vacuum desiccators until use 2 2 2 preparation of synthetic melanoidin solution the reaction between sugars and amino acids in the presence of high temperatures and low water activity results in a so called maillard reaction that forms melanoidin pigment melanoidin pigment is formed principally by reacting reducing sugar with the amino acid at high temperatures following this synthetic melanoidin pigment was extracted as a representative sample for a spent wash in this experiment synthetic melanoidins were prepared by mixing 1 0 m m of reduced sugar d galactose 1 0 m amino acid asparagine and 0 5 m of na₂co₃ were dispersed in 1 0 l of distilled water and the solution was refluxed at 100 c for 7 h the resulting solid constitute was taken as stock for further solution preparation the synthetic solution containing the pigment was ready as per the initial concentration required in the adsorption process the ph was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions d galactose and asparagine were provided from the food engineering department bahir dar university 2 2 3 adsorbent characterization 2 2 3 1 functional groups the existence of abundant functional groups presents on the active surface of the adsorbent was evaluated using ft ir fourier transform infrared a sample of scbac and mbfa was mixed with dry kbr in the ratio of 1 200 w w and ground in mortal and piston the well mixed sample was placed on a znse crystal and pressed to make a palate then the sample was scanned over a wavelength of 399 193 4000 6 cm 1 by an attenuated total reflection of ft ir 6600 type a jasco model found in bahir dar university the spectrum of ftir was obtained at the scanning speed of 2 mm s with a 4 cm 1 resolution aperture auto 7 1 mm filter auto 10 000 hz and triglycine sulfate tgs detector then the scanned sample was plotted in terms of wavenumber cm 1 vs transmittance 2 2 3 2 crystallinity characterization of scbac and mbfa related to the structure of crystallinity and analysis was carried out using xrd x ray diffraction machine with a designation of minflux 300 600 powder x ray diffractometer rigaco usa the spectra for xrd were collected from addis ababa university chemistry department the apparatus was adjusted with cu tube and with cukα graphic monochromator radiation with λ 1 540593 å and a scan speed of 10 min in the range between 2 theta of 10 70 with a step size of 0 02 the scanned result was recorded in terms of 2 theta degrees vs intensity count 2 2 3 3 surface morphology for the investigation of the morphology of the scbac and mbfa adsorbents scanning electron microscopy sem was found to be a useful instrument the morphological visual structure of the scbac sample was tested by using fe sem fib model neon 40 field emission scanning electron microscope nanomanufacturing technology center nmtc cmti india at addis ababa science and technology university the sem image before adsorption was tested to investigate the morphological and structural characteristics of the adsorbent 2 2 3 4 point of zero charge the salt addition technique was used to analyze the point zero charge of the scbac and mbfa adsorbents an equal amount of solute was added to a series of a solution containing different ph strengths 26 28 0 2 g of scbac and mbfa was dispersed in a 40 ml solution containing 0 1 m nacl solution in a 50 ml beaker for ph adjustment a concentration of 0 1 m of hcl for acidic conditions and 0 1 m naoh for the basic condition was used to tune ph values at 2 4 6 8 and 10 0 2 ph tolerance units the initial ph condition was designated as phi in the end the ph values in each beaker were recorded which is represented as phf during the entire process the samples were shaken for 24 h by using a rotary agitator heidolph unimax 2010 shaker no 542 10020 001 germany at 200 rpm the point zero charges were obtained from the plot of δph phf phi against phi 2 2 4 batch adsorption process the batch adsorption was performed by dispersing a known amount of adsorbents in 50 ml of synthetic spent wash solution in a 100 ml capacity of erlenmeyer flask the mixture was agitated at 125 rpm the experimental design is based on general factorial consisting of four factors including adsorbent dosage 2 3 and 4 g l contact time 30 60 and 90 min temperature 25 37 5 and 50 c and ph 2 6 and 10 the adsorption experiments were carried out at an initial melanoidin concentration of 200 mg l at the final adsorption time interval the supernatant clear solutions in the flasks were examined for final concentration following centrifugation 2 2 5 color removal capacity the decolorizing activity was expressed in terms of the percent removal efficiency by the modified method described previously 29 a perkinelmer uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 35 was used for absorbance measurement and recording of visible absorption spectra fig 2 a shows the uv spectra of synthetic spent wash before adsorption to determine the maximum wavelength decolorization of distillery spent wash was determined by monitoring of decrease in absorbency by scanning the sample at the maximum wavelength λmax 310 nm of each spent wash fig 2 b shows a calibration curve that correlates absorbance and concentration having r2 0 9926 regression coefficient which is close to unity this curve is important to calculate the final concentration after adsorption and later to calculate color removal efficiency the linearized equation that is used to calculate final concentration ct and color removal efficiency is given in equations 2 and 3 respectively as 2 ct mg l absorbance å 0 2364 0 0188 3 color removal ci ct ci 100 where co and ct are melanoidin concentrations in mg l before and after adsorption respectively 2 2 6 adsorption at equilibrium the optimal conditions adsorbent dosage ph temperature and contact time that give the maximum removal efficiency were used to conduct isotherm adsorption experiments at equilibrium in a batch wise operation while varying the initial melanoidin concentration at 210 220 230 240 and 250 mg l the values obtained were plugged in different isotherm models including freundlich and langmuir models for comparison most of the time these isotherm models are recommended when working with adsorption on wastewater treatment 30 and are important to study the equilibrium adsorbate adsorbent interaction 31 the amount of adsorbed coloring material per unit adsorbent g at equilibrium and at some time t was obtained from equations 4 and 5 respectively as 4 qe ci ce m v 5 qt ci ct m v where qe and qt are adsorbent loading at equilibrium and at some time t respectively co and ce are the initial concentration and concentration at the equilibrium of the adsorbate respectively mg g v is the total volume of the solution ml and m is the adsorbent mass g the experimental data obtained such as concentration and adsorbent loading retained on the sorbent were plugged into an equilibrium isotherm model then the best fit model for the sorption system was determined and selected based on the coefficient of determination r2 using the best fit model important adsorption parameters were calculated primarily from the curve s slope and intercept with this relationship it was able to correlate variation of melanoidin concentration 2 2 7 isotherm study 2 2 7 1 freundlich model the principle of adsorbents heterogeneous surface is mainly considered in freundlich isotherm 32 since the freundlich equation is represented as an exponential equation so the concentration of adsorbate on the adsorbent heterogeneous surface increases along with the increment of the melanoidin concentration this isotherm therefore incorporate the principle of adsorbent surface heterogeneity and the exponential dispersal of active sites and their energies as well 33 the nonlinear form as represented in equation 6 is linearized to plot the experimental data into the expression as described in equation 7 6 qe kf ce1 n 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf is constant parameters that show relative adsorbent adsorption capacity in mg g and n is also a constant parameter that shows adsorption intensity the value of n can be seen in three cases of sorption nature these are when n 1 sorption is linear when n 1 sorption is physical and n 1 sorption is chemical 2 2 7 2 langmuir model an assumption of uniform energy distribution on the surface of adsorption is considered during adsorption the other important consideration is that there is no mass transfer of sorbet in the adsorbent plane surface as shown in equations 8 and 9 the nonlinear 34 forms linearized for the development of a linear curve 8 q e q m ce k l 1 cek l 9 ce q e 1 k l q m c e q m where qe is the amount solute loaded per unit mass of adsorbent at equilibrium condition in mg g qm is the maximum adsorption capacity in mg g kl is a constant parameter associated with adsorption capacity l mg this parameter is typically varied with surface area and adsorbent porosity this indicates a higher surface area and a better pore volume distribution turns into a higher adsorption capacity 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization 3 1 1 functional groups ftir spectra of rscb as raw material and adsorbents of scbac and mbfa obtained are shown in fig 3 and important adsorptive sites were noted all spectra showed similar peaks in the range of 500 4000 cm 1 the peaks between 500 and 800 cm 1 can be related to ch ch2 and c h stretching vibrations within the aromatic arrangements 35 the respective bands associated with this range are 697 and 621 cm 1 the intensity of this group decreased in scbac and mbfa than rscb this is due to carbon burning and its liberation in the forms of oxidized carbons in the activation and thermal treatment processes mbfa has experienced the lowest peak due to the burning of carbon giving raised to a high percentage of ash the peaks around 1016 to 1101 cm 1 are assigned to c o bonds which may be due to alcohol ether ester or carboxylic acid the corresponding band in this range is 1080 the bands from 1300 to 1400 cm 1 are assigned for no bend respectively therefore the spectra noted in 1374 belong to this function group the band around 1637 cm 1 is represented as cc aromatic skeletal vibration which possibly exists in the lignin aromatic structure the intense peak around 2369 cm 1 revealed a cn which belongs to aliphatic iso nitriles the band between 2700 and 3000 cm 1 characterizes the presence of ch aliphatic axial that is deformed in the constituent of ch2 and ch3functional groups from cellulose hemicellulose and lignin the corresponding identified spectrum is 2925 cm 1 the broad peak that ranges from 3100 to 3600 cm 1 belongs to o h stretching this is due to the phenomenon of oxidation at the surface of treated samples by phosphoric acid from fig 3 the identified characteristic of the oh group is at 3452 cm 1 the weak band around 3747 cm 1 is referred to as the oh band in alcohol or phenol having vibration and stretching band fig 3 also shows relative transmittance values for rscb as compared to scbac and mbfa samples generally from the ftir result it can be inferred that variation of intensities was a result of chemical changes as sugar cane bagasse going through the pretreatment steps and most importantly due to the impregnation of rscb with phosphoric acid and drying processes 3 1 2 crystallinity the xrd patterns as shown in fig 4 show a notable difference between scbac and mbfa a broader diffraction peak at 24 96 and 26 84 degrees were identified for scbac this indicates that the scbac adsorbent was principally amorphous besides the absence of an intense peak shows a mostly amorphous phase nature 36 conversely in the case of mbfa some sharp and intense peak was observed at 2θ around 25 5ᵒ 28 24ᵒ and 50 4ᵒ indicating a crystalline structure this may be as a result of recrystallization of amorphous to crystalline structure burnt at an elevated temperature that can reach up to1000oc for steam production in a steam power plant furthermore the major peaks indicated in scbac and mbfa correspond to the planes for scbac the planes 1103 and 1082 correspond to 24 96 and 26 84 the phases at 26 84 are the representation of cliftonite c and the peak at 24 96 revealed quartz q or sio2 a similar result was reported by previous research work which exhibits broad peak diffraction at 26 53 and 20 68 37 the mbfa sample presented major peaks that are the main characteristics of the mineral phases of quartz and cristobalite this result is in good agreement with previous works where the major peaks experience quartz and cristobalite 38 the major diffraction peaks in mbfa that include 14 23 84 25 5ᵒ 28 24ᵒ 35 34 and 50 4ᵒ corresponds to a crystal plane of 524 635 865 2484 423 and 498 3 1 3 surface morphology evaluation of the photomicrographs for mbfa and scbac are presented in fig 5 a and b as depicted from fig 5 a the occurrence of heterogeneous and highly porous cavities on the surface of scbac with irregular macro pores was identified they have a scattered particle shape and size from fig 6 a the mean pore diameter is approximately 0 603 μm the shapes of the pores are mostly elliptical as shown from fig 5 b mbfa has heterogeneous surface morphology in terms of its sizes and shapes the existence of rough and porous particles is observed with regards to their particle shape fibrous prismatic and round particle shapes can be identified as can be revealed from fig 5 b mbfa consists of a bubble like structure which might be due to high temperature during burning triggers a molten state that creates round pore shapes that previously retained a bubble 39 a similar morphological property was reported in previous research works 40 from the morphological analysis shown in fig 6 b the mean pore diameter of mbfa is approximately 0 105 μm and their shapes are well sorted having very low sphericity comparatively both adsorbents possess porous morphological structure indicating the possibility of attachment of the melanoidin color forming chemicals onto the available holes the morphology of mbfa is relatively defined and well sorted the regularity of the mbfa particle is better than scbac due to the crystallinity phase nature as can be evidenced by the xrd analysis in fig 5 3 2 effects of singular factors on the adsorption the experimental result of adsorption of melanoidin pigment onto scbac and mbfa was analyzed at varied points of contact time overall the removal efficiency for the case of mbfa increased over the entire period of the contact time as can be observed from fig 7 a an increase in percent removal efficiency of pigment from 72 to 81 was observed by mbfa as the contact time rose from 30 to 60 min then the removal efficiency continues to increase slightly to 83 when further increasing contact time to 90 min this is the time when the removal efficiency by mbfa hits the maximum with regard to scbac the percentage experienced an increasing trend from 90 to 91 in the first 30 min though the removal efficiency showed a marginal decline to 90 till 90 min of contact time the justification behind a fast early stage uptake of the solute is because activated carbon initially has a sufficient number of available active sites on its surface however there was no longer be an available site as exposure time is increased as a result even if there is a small number of unoccupied pores the adsorbate might face difficulty to be adhered due to the repulsion force that takes place between the already attached adsorbate and the one in the medium 41 the percentage removal of melanoidin pigment by scbac and mbfa in relation to adsorbent dosage is presented in fig 7 b the influence of adsorbent dosage on percentage removal over a range of 2 4 g l was investigated at fixed ph 6 contact time 60 min and temperature 25 c from fig 7 b the color removal increased entirely for the adsorbents percentage removal rose from 89 to 91 and 77 to 82 with adsorbent dose varied between 2 and 4 g l for scbac and mbfa respectively the maximum percentage of removal reached at a dosage of 4 g l this is basically because of more adsorption free sites created when introducing more adsorbents into the system 42 43 fig 7 c shows how the system temperature of the batch adsorption significantly affects removal efficiency on both scbac and mbfa the temperature of the system was taken over the range 25 c 50 c at constant ph 6 adsorbent dosage 4 g l and contact time 60 min when the temperature of the system increased from 25 c to 50 c the percentage of color removal by scbac plummeted after 25 c 91 reaching a low removal efficiency of 62 1 at 50 c similarly for mbfa it experienced a similar declining trajectory when the temperature increased from 25 to 50 c which corresponded to a percentage removal ranging from 81 to 56 an increase in the temperature of the solution triggers the vibration of the atoms so that the adsorbed species could be detached from the active site and returned to the solution which substantially decreases the removal percentage 44 this is also due to the expansion of the pore as a result of the high energy of activation that imparts the solute to diffuse back to the solution the optimal time for adsorption of melanoidin pigment from the solution is apparently at 25 c for both the adsorbents the effect of initial ph is one of the most decisive factors in the removal of the color because of the interaction force exerted by either h or oh ions between the adsorbate and the adsorbent that potentially could influence the adsorption capacity functional groups available on the surface of the adsorbents are subjected to dissociation when the ph of the system is varied fig 7 c presents the influence of ph on the degradation of melanoidin pigment in a range of 2 10 at a constant adsorbent dose 4 g l contact time 60 min temperature 25 c both adsorbent surface charge and solution ph greatly influence the extent of the adsorption as it can be seen from fig 8 a the higher acidic condition i e ph 6 was favorable for the adsorption of both scbac and mbfa this is due to a low level of competition for an active site that takes place amid adsorbent and ve charges h 45 hence a reduction of ve charges on the surface of the adsorbent favors the condition at a ph of 6 the decrease in potential precipitation and possible ions solubility 46 47 results in the attachment of color forming ions to favor this ph condition as shown from fig 8 a removal percentage over ph range from 2 to 10 was varied from 90 to 89 and 76 71 for scbac and mbfa respectively as ph increased in the acidic region from 2 to 6 the percentage removal of melanoidin pigment by scbac was increased slightly from 90 to 91 for the case of mbfa the effect is intense that the removal percentage increased dramatically from 76 at a ph of 2 and leaped at 84 at a ph of 6 additional rise to ph of 10 results in a decrease in the removal of melanoidin pigment to 89 and 71 by scbac and mbfa respectively noticeably from the experiment the adsorption of pigments of melanoidin by both adsorbents is not favorable in basic media while the interaction is larger at ph 6 as shown in fig 8 b the zero points of charge phpzc analysis was also analyzed for both of the adsorbents the phpzc value where all the surface of scbac charged was 6 8 and for mbfa were 7 2 the surface of scbac and mbfa is positively charged ph phpzc above the value of 6 8 and 7 2 respectively while the surface is negatively charged below the value of the phpzc ph phpzc 48 3 3 adsorption isotherm study the most important characteristic to study the interaction between adsorbents and the adsorbate is isotherm where different adsorption parameters are determined optimized values of the adsorption are used to develop the isotherm models including freundlich and langmuir isotherm models from the plots in fig 9 the required information related to isotherm is summarized as presented in table 3 the coefficient of determination r2 for scbac and mbfa was 0 996 and 0 995 respectively for the langmuir isotherm model fig 9 a and b which looked to be much more applicable than the freundlich model with r2 0 966 and 0 954 for scbac and mbfa respectively since it has the highest difference of regression coefficient of determination for the concentration range considered for the experiment at the equilibrium hence the parameters based on the best fit langmuir model can be explained the ideal localized monolayer model comes to the adsorption phenomena according to which therefore the possible mechanism by which adsorbents eliminate color constituent from solutions are guided by the following mechanisms the attachment of the molecules on the adsorbent surface is at fixed sites in a monolayer only one molecule can be occupied by each site the area of each spot is a fixed quantity determined solely by the geometry of the surface the adsorption energy is proportionate at all spots such behavior on the basis of kinematic consideration is presuming that the adsorbed solutes cannot migrate across the surface of the interaction with other adjacent molecules separation factor rl as shown in equation 10 is a dimensionless constant that is important to define the whether the adsorption condition is favorable 0 r l 1 unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 irreversible r l 0 10 r l 1 1 k l c o from the results shown in table 3 the value of rl is 0 035 for scbac and 0 041 for mbfa which the sorption undergoes a favorable process condition a value of kl of 0 136 l mg for scbac and 0 117l mg for mbfa was obtained which means the given amount was essential for the sorption process to attain half saturation of the adsorbents from the langmuir model the adsorption capacity on to mbfa 14 154 mg g is higher than the scbac 13 966 mg g which might be due to the treatment agent h2o2 used for modifying the fly ash might have increased the surface area 3 4 adsorption kinetics and mechanism models the kinetics of the adsorption is important to be studied since it describes the rate by which the adsorbent uptakes the adsorbate the linearized form of pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations which was shown by equations 11 and 12 was applied to investigate the kinetics of the adsorption the assumption of the models is considering that surface concentrations are equivalent to the concentrations measured the pseudo first order is expressed as represented as 49 11 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 where k1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order min 1 and t is the contact time min a linear plot of log t against log qe qt was developed to determine k1 from the slope of linear plots kinetic data were further studied with the pseudo second order kinetic equation model 50 this kinetic model assumes that the rate limiting stage considers chemisorption that involves the electrons exchange between the adsorbate and adsorbent the fitting of the model is plotted using the expression given below 12 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where k2is the rate constant of pseudo second order rate constant min 1 data of t against t qt was plotted to determine k2 the linear curve obtained for the different kinetic models are depicted in fig 10 the kinetic parameters that are important for the determination of values to analyze the adsorption of melanoidin pigment by scbac and mbfa are summarized in table 4 from the results the pseudo second order model provides the highest coefficient of determination r2 0 9999 for both adsorbents while pseudo first order provides a correlation coefficient of r2 0 9237 and 0 8871 for scbac and mbfa respectively previous research indicated that chemisorption results in rate limiting steps by involving valence forces via electrons exchange between the adsorbent and adsorbate 51 intraparticle diffusion was treated as an additional kinetic model to further examine the mechanism of the process the linearized relation for intraparticle diffusion is proposed by weber and morris and is described by equation 13 52 13 qt kidt1 2 c where kid is the rate constant for intraparticle diffusion min 0 5 c is the constant value related to boundary layer thickness mg g the experimental data were fitted t1 2 versus qt with the linearized intraparticle diffusion model plot as can be depicted in fig 11 from the result it can be noticed that a bi linear portion includes one slanted and the other constant portion this phenomenon suggests that two mechanisms occurred simultaneously during the adsorption process this might be due to the variance in the early and final stages of mass transfer rate that occurred in the adsorption 53 the values of kid and correlation coefficient c are given in table 4 3 5 adsorption thermodynamics the change in the values of parameters obtained from the thermodynamics study reveals the degree of the spontaneity of the adsorption during the experiment the adsorption was performed at a temperature of 303 323 343 and 363 k the negative and positive values of δgo imply that the adsorption is a spontaneous and nonspontaneous process respectively 54 exothermic and the endothermic nature of the adsorption process can also be determined from the thermodynamic study these fundamental thermodynamic properties are correlated as described in equation 14 14 δgo δho tδs where δgo is the standard free energy change kj mol δho is the enthalpy changes kj mol t is the solution temperature ok and δsois entropy change kj mol k δgo can also be expressed in equation 15 as described by the van t hoff equation 15 δgo rt ln kc equation 16 is the linearized form of van t hoff that yields a plot of 1 t vs ln k c which is important to determine δho and δso r is the gas constant with the value of 8 314 j mol k kc is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant l g which is expressed in terms of qe which is the amount of melanoidin pigment adsorbed on the sorbent mass mg g at equilibrium and ce which is an equilibrium concentration mg l 16 ln kc δ s o r δ h o rt 17 kc qe ce table 5 shows the calculated thermodynamic parameters obtained from the slope and intercepts values of the scbac and mbfa graphs as shown in fig 12 a and b a result indicates δho with values of 29 418 kj mol and 23 898 kj mol for scbac and mbfa respectively the negative value reflects that the reaction is a purely exothermic process for both adsorbents from this it is apparent to note that the adsorption is preferred higher removal efficiency at a lower temperature which in turn implies that the adsorption is exothermic δho also indicates whether the interaction of the adsorbent and adsorbate is due to physical or chemically binding forces a previous study has estimated that the parameter limit for thermodynamic that suggests the heat of adsorption is less than 80 kj mol is physisorption 55 furthermore when the heat of adsorption is less than 40 kj mol the adsorption followed the ion exchange between adsorbent and adsorbate accordingly from the result shown in table 5 it is clear that the heat of adsorption for the adsorbents is less than the limit specified so δhoin the process of removal of melanoidin pigment by scbac and mbfa is physisorption and the attachment is guided by ion exchange with regard to δs indicated the degree of disorderliness of the melanoidin pigment attachment onto scbac and mbfa during the adsorption process from the result the entropy value for scbac and mbfa was 0 105 and 0 089 kj mol k δs with a negative value indicates an adsorbent without a significant alteration in the structure as a result of the adsorption process comparatively mbfa shows a lesser disorder value that might be attributed to the crystalline nature of mbfa as the temperature rose in the solution a decrease in the value of δgo was observed which defines the adsorbents are feasible and spontaneous as well feasibility is an important term as it indicates the potential of adsorbent reusability 3 6 adsorption on real spent wash the optimized adsorption parameters conducted on the synthetic spent wash were applied to the real spent wash from table 6 it is clear that there is significant color degradation by scbac and mbfa on real waste the performance of scbac and mbfa for the removal of melanoidin pigment on the real spent wash sample and the synthetic spent wash solution was comparable with only 0 71 and 0 96 of deviation for scbac and mbfa respectively the higher removal efficiency was recorded for scbac 90 3 3 7 comparison of adsorption capacity and removal efficiency table 7 compares the color removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity of scbac and mbfa with different adsorbent materials for the melanoidin pigment removal from molasses based spent wash 4 conclusion in conclusion the possibility of degrading recalcitrant melanoidin pigment from spent wash was proven as revealed from the characterization the synthesized scbac was amorphous having a macro porous morphological structure with a varying functional group on the active sites mbfa showed similar functional groups with a lower percent transmittance and a complete crystalline structure was found out during the adoption process three level four factors adsorbent dosage mg contact time min initial ph and temperature oc were varied to achieve the maximum possible removal efficiency based on the results of the analysis the removal efficiency of melanoidin color was affected by the process parameters the pronounced effect was noticed by the variation of system temperature of the adsorption for both adsorbent types the maximum melanoidin color removal percentage by the scbac on the synthetic spent wash and real spent wash was 90 and 91 respectively which was obtained at the optimum process conditions of adsorbent dosage 4 g l contact time 60 min initial ph 6 and temperature 25 c conversely in the case of mbfa the maximum removal efficiency on synthetic and real spent wash was 82 54 and 81 2 respectively at optimal process conditions of adsorbent dosage 4 g l contact time 90 min initial ph 6 and temperature 25 c results from equilibrium and kinetic data resulted in the best fit on langmuir and pseudo second order for both adsorbents the mechanism of the adsorption was analyzed using the intraparticle diffusion model that shows bilinear adsorption stages from the thermodynamics study it was able to note that the adsorption system for melanoidin color onto scbac and mbfa was exothermic physisorption and the mode of the adsorption is guided by ion exchange it was also noted that the adsorption process was spontaneous funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 5 conflictsof interest the author declares that he has

8781,critical infrastructure facilities play an important role in ensuring the safety of human life the present paper provides an overview of the legal framework for critical infrastructure facilities regarding protection against epidemiological risk based on test results for treated and raw water samples n 8973 and samples collected in water treatment plants at individual stages of the technological process the effectiveness of water treatment processes used at the plants was assessed with regard to selected pathogens i e coliforms bacteria escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis and clostridium perfringens it was demonstrated that the level of bacteriological contamination of river water is mainly determined by the number of fecal bacteria coliforms bacteria and enterococcus faecalis and the proportion of individual types of pathogens in water from both the river and infiltration wells does not change significantly throughout the year and presents the following order coliforms bacteria clostridium perfringens enterococcos faecalis it was shown that the process of soil infiltration is highly effective in removing pathogenic bacteria 99 on average and may present an alternative to intermediate processes of water treatment comparable to filtration on dynasand filters the level of microbial removal was high at the intermediate stage of water treatment i e preliminary coagulation in settling tanks and filtration on sand filters following subsequent technological processes namely disinfection with uv light and gas chlorine or ozonation and filtration on activated carbon there was a 100 reduction in microbiological pathogens in the water analyzed which is an essential requirement to ensure the safety of drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords critical infrastructure water treatment processes drinking water microbiological pathogens 1 introduction 1 1 microbial pathogens and viruses that generate water sanitation currently global discussions on the security of collective water supply are provoked more and more often the social responsibility of operators of water sources water treatment plants and water supply networks requires them to undertake serious actions aimed at providing safety and adequate quality of the services they offer water supply companies responsible for providing a unique product i e water must adhere to strict qualitative and quantitative criteria 1 3 however last year saw a number of alarming signals pointing to the dissemination of information which might have confused water recipients as regards their epidemiological safety related to drinking water supply 5 viruses and bacteria are widespread in the aqueous environment 4 the most common pathogenic bacteria found in water are coliforms bacteria escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis and clostridium perfringens 5 the indicated pathogens are detected in surface waters in all parts of the world and are considered indicators of bacteriological contamination of waters 6 the main source of their occurrence is pollution of faecal water soil environment leaky septic tanks illegal sewage discharges into ditches and fields despite the increase in sewerage in large areas including rural areas there is still a problem that residents do not use collective sewage collection and treatment systems 7 in addition to the above mentioned types of bacteria water can be contaminated with among others staphylococcus aureus bacteria 8 the impact of the identified most common pathogens on human health and sanitary safety is enormous they can cause the so called water related diseases diarrhea dysentery stomach problems body infections typhoid in addition the widespread use of antibiotics and the appearance of their residues in the environment may contribute to the spread of bacterial resistance 9 11 water borne viruses posing a risk to human health include polioviruses causing poliomyelitis rotaviruses particularly dangerous for children and infants adenoviruses astroviruses enteroviruses including hepatitis a virus papillomaviruses oncogenic and hepatovirus e causing hepatitis e 12 14 there are numerous factors determining the number and forms of microorganisms and their survival in the aqueous environment including temperature insolation season of the year and humidity 4 5 the main methods of inactivating microbial and viral pathogens from water are disinfection using uv lamps chlorine gas or ozonation methods that do not result in the formation of harmful products of chemical processes are introduced more and more often i e the use of artificial filtration and membrane technologies 15 18 one of the most important aspects to microbiological safety of collective water supply processes is the water disinfection monitoring system 19 20 disinfection is usually the last very important stage of water treatment or constitutes one of water purification processes providing protection against secondary water contamination in the water supply system the main goal of water disinfection is the removal of pathogenic organisms and their spores from water 21 22 the main disinfectants used in water treatment plants wtp are gas chlorine cl2 sodium hypochlorite naocl and chlorine dioxide clo2 23 another common method is physical disinfection with uv light 22 24 25 ultraviolet non ionizing radiation affects the adsorption of the ribonucleic acid of the virus into other chemical structures resulting in its inactivation 4 enveloped viruses are less stable in an aquatic environment and highly susceptible to disinfection processes such as oxidation with chlorine 26 processes that support the removal of pathogenic microorganisms from water are soil infiltration filtration coagulation and flocculation oxidation and adsorption 21 27 28 filtration is one of the most effective processes of treating all types of water used in water supply systems allowing for the removal of particles smaller that the pores between the granules in the filtering bed 29 most often high values of the following parameters turbidity color and the levels of planktonic organisms bacteria and viruses are decisive in choosing coagulation sedimentation filtration oxidation and disinfection as key processes in treating water intended for human consumption 5 30 a crucial role in the process of treating microbiologically contaminated water is played by primary and intermediate treatment processes as they guarantee effective disinfection with both uv light and gas chlorine 31 modern water treatment processes allow for limiting the spread of various epidemic diseases caused by microbiological pathogens 21 32 33 in accordance with the currently applicable regulation of the minister of health 34 water supply companies are not obliged to test for the presence of viruses in water however numerous cyclical analyses of microbiological contamination especially of fecal origin allow for detecting potential health hazard hotspots as regards drinking water additionally safety procedures and the existing and newly introduced water treatment technologies are regularly verified also in terms of the epidemiological safety of collective water supply the study described in the present paper focused on the assessment of the effectiveness of water treatment processes used in two wtp located in southern poland cee in stary sącz wtpss and in świniarsko wtps in terms of deactivating microbiological pathogens whose presence was reported in the years 2015 2019 in the present paper the following elements have been analyzed i presence of microbiological pathogens in surface and ground water collected at the two water treatment plants ii characteristics of seasonal variability of pathogens in surface and ground water iii effectiveness of water treatment processes and health security of water recipients as regards the presence of 4 selected pathogens the research objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of water treatment processes carried out in a water supply company due to the presence of microbiological pathogens that may cause an epidemic threat the indicated research goal is important from the point of view of the scientific community to collect the current state of knowledge on the resistance of water treatment technology systems to the epidemic threat of water carrying microbiological pathogens the paper addresses a relevant and topical problem of bacteriological epidemic safety of water mainly related to the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in water intended for human consumption 35 36 the research purpose indicated in the manuscript is important from the perspective of both new data and implementation value studies published to date on infectious diseases caused by microbiological pathogens present in the aquatic environment have largely focused on the analyses of bacteriological contamination of waste water released from the treatment plant to the environment and its disinfection 37 42 however enterprises responsible for providing a food product in the form of drinking water are obliged to meet specific quality requirements with regard to their products thus the paper discusses the problem faced by water intake operators namely their obligation to obtain specified levels of pathogen inactivation already during the preliminary and intermediate technological processes of water treatment which also include natural treatment methods like soil infiltration the main application value of this paper is the in depth research on the reduction of microorganisms in the preliminary and intermediate water treatment processes rather than only in their final stage of physical and chemical disinfection the majority of the papers published to date focus solely on the effectiveness of the final disinfection of water with the use of physical methods uv light and chemical reagents such as gas chlorine chlorine dioxide sodium hypochlorite and ozone and on the disinfection by products dbps formed as a result of a reaction between disinfecting agents and naturally occurring organic matter bromides and iodides and anthropogenic pollutants 43 45 the authors of the present paper went a step further by analysing and calculating the percentage reduction in the number of microorganisms at individual water treatment stages including those involving soil infiltration volumetric coagulation in vertical settling tanks and filtration on dynasand sand filters the paper compares the effectiveness of microbial removal in two independent technological systems taking into account both the type of water collected from the environment and the differences in the water treatment technology used which additionally increases the cognitive value of this research in the technical context a major advantage of the work is that the long term results come from water treatment plants operating on a dynamic technical scale rather than from laboratory experiments or micro installations at water treatment plants our analysis of the current state of knowledge has revealed that there are not many scientific papers based on the results obtained from dynamically operating technological systems at water treatment plants furthermore the results presented in the paper may be of interest to researchers representing other scientific fields e g ichthyologists ecologists the results pertain to the river water from a considerable basin area over 6800 km2 the sanitary condition of the river water might present a threat not only to the life and health of the inhabitants but also to the ichtyofauna and the ecological potential of the river it also needs to be emphasized that the majority of the basin area is legally protected natura 2000 and landscape park areas the authors emphasize that in light of constantly emerging challenges and new threats to critical infrastructure security the subject discussed requires further in depth research without comprehensive analyses of the existing water treatment processes it is impossible to objectively assess the degree of safety and security in case of emergencies including epidemic emergencies these should be long term analyses demonstrating a multiannual picture of risk reduction and the nature of the emerging quantitative and qualitative positive negative trends 1 2 legal framework for critical infrastructure facilities regarding protection against epidemiological and sanitary risk in poland critical infrastructure comprises assets that are used to satisfy the needs of all citizens and undoubtedly includes systems of collective water supply 46 these are technical facilities whose proper operation guarantees health security of consumers who use the drinking water supplied pursuant to the act on collective water supply applicable in poland 47 water supply and sewage management companies are obliged to provide continuous supply of water presenting appropriate required quality supervised by the national sanitary inspectorate to maintain occupational safety of these facilities and systems relevant supervisory units need to assume enormous social responsibility which is put to the test especially in situations of emergency such as the epidemiological risk emergencies or epidemic emergencies pursuant to the provisions laid down in the act on prevention and control of infections and infectious diseases in humans 48 an epidemiological risk emergency is a situation that has been legally enforced due to the risk of an epidemic outbreak an epidemic emergency on the other hand is a situation that has been legally enforced due to the existing epidemic in order to undertake legally defined preventive and anti epidemic actions that would minimize negative effects of the epidemic procedures for actions to be undertaken in situations of emergency including those of epidemiological risk are defined in the act on crisis management 49 a particularly important task for water supply and sewage management companies is to introduce technical systemic and organizational solutions that provide protection against epidemiological risk and its consequences and organize appropriate employee training in this field a legislative document addressing the issue of protection critical infrastructure is the act on extraordinary solutions to prevent mitigate and combat covid 19 and other infectious diseases and the ensuing crisis situations 50 based on this legal act managers of critical infrastructure facilities and systems were given additional rights and responsibilities during the time of an emergency in order to ensure secure operation of these facilities if necessary managers of critical infrastructure can enter third party owned premises or property housing the infrastructure mentioned assisted by police officers if the owners refuse such entry such action is necessary to ensure continuous operation of these facilities including water supply maintenance works or failure repair according to the provisions of the act critical facility managers can introduce changes in the work organization at these facilities to ensure their continuous operation and thus continuous security of service recipients among documents allowing for identification of potential emergencies and risks that can affect the public health are water safety plans wsp these manuals when responsibly and thoroughly developed are an integral element of critical infrastructure facilities preparedness for various situations such as an epidemic they form a part of the recommended preventive approach towards risk management 19 the current operational procedures for water supply and sewage management companies both in times of regular operation and emergency and crisis situations allow for maintaining security of the services provided 2 characteristics of the study area the study was conducted in two water treatment plants wtp located in southern poland the first wtp analyzed is located in stary sącz wtpss and the second in świniarsko wtps they are both supplied with water from river bed infiltration and surface left and right bank intake points on the dunajec river additionally wtps takes water from infiltration wells and an irrigation ditch whereas wtpss uses a system of artificial infiltration basins 51 53 fig 1 present localization of wtps and wtpss the dunajec is a large mountain river characterized by seasonal flow variability especially after winter snowmelt and variable physicochemical water composition including significant changes in turbidity suspension size and organic matter content 22 the fluctuations in water turbidity are the outcome of water treatment processes and determine reagent dosing information on the quality status of the river is derived from state monitoring data and test results obtained in the course of monitoring water sources and wastewater treatment plants 54 the areas directly adjacent to the intakes are mainly fields meadows and single family housing this is reflected in the origin of the bacteria that are found in the water soil environment mainly of fecal origin wtps and wtpss which served as sampling sites are critical infrastructure facilities within the system of collective water supply which serves over 100 000 recipients as of december 31 2019 both these plants apply the most extensive water treatment processes comprising 3 and 4 steps respectively in the technological process used at wtps non treated raw water from the surface intake point p 1 fig 2 is directed to two open horizontal settling tanks p 4 1 and 4 2 where the processes of volumetric coagulation and sedimentation take place water taken from the river is passed to the irrigation ditch from which it artificially feeds the infiltration intake comprising a system of 16 wells p 6 with the total capacity of 7000 m3 d such primarily purified water is pumped into 12 dynasand continuous sand filters p 7 where the process of contact coagulation takes place after treatment on the sand filters the water together with the water from 11 deep water wells with max capacity of 4000 m3 d p 8 is disinfected with uv light p 9 and chlorine gas p 11 the maximum capacity of wtps is 16 800 m3 d wtpss draws water directly from the river via river bed infiltration intake p 1 fig 3 and from infiltration wells supplied with surface water p 5 all of the water in this plant maximum capacity of 500 m3 h is subjected to the treatment process the water is pumped from the collection chambers p 2 into two vertical settling tanks where volumetric coagulation takes place p 3 1 and 3 2 and then directed to 10 dynasand continuous self cleaning filters p 6 where contact coagulation is carried out next the water flows into a contact tank where it is ozonated p 7 after this process the water is pumped into eight pressure filters with an activated carbon bed p 8 after filtration the water is disinfected with uv light and gas chlorine p 9 and 10 the part of water that remains in the collection chambers is pumped into a system of three infiltration basins p 4 after soil infiltration the water is collected at about 190 m3 h by submersible pumps installed in 16 well holes next the water is subjected to subsequent treatment steps depending on its quality ozonation sorption on carbon filters together with uv light and gas chlorine disinfection or additionally filtration on dynasand filters together with other treatment processes thus treated water is collected in four clean water tanks p 11 1 11 4 and pumped into the water supply network p 13 delivering drinking water to consumers 24 the current water production stemming from the inhabitants demand ranges from 9 000 m3 d to 10 000 m3 d the maximum capacity of wtpss is 14 000 m3 d 25 3 materials and methods the effectiveness of the technological water treatment processes in reducing the numbers of bacteria was assessed based on the analysis of test results obtained in the years 2015 2019 the tests had been conducted on water drawn directly from the river and from the infiltration basins water samples collected at individual treatment stages and finally treated water pumped into the water supply network figs 2 and 3 water samples were collected from both wtp at 4 stages stage i from 2 surface water intakes on the dunajec river n 708 including 358 samples from wtps and 350 from wtpss with a frequency of twice a month stage ii from 2 infiltration intake systems n 1142 including 465 collective samples from infiltration wells at wtps and 677 collective samples from wells at wtpss with a frequency of once a week stage iii after treatment in primary settling tanks and sand filters n 1789 including 886 from wtps and 903 from wtpss with a frequency of once every 2 weeks stage iv after the entire treatment process n 5334 including 2661 from wtps and 2673 from wtpss with a frequency of once a week the samples collected were tested for the presence of four types of pathogens 1 coliforms bacteria 2 escherichia coli 3 clostridium perfringens and 4 enterococcus faecalis the frequency of sampling was determined by the wtp monitoring schedule for each of the pathogens listed table 1 and table 2 in accordance with the requirements set out in the water law and the regulation 55 of the minister of health 34 it should be mentioned that the sampling schedule is always agreed with the state sanitary inspector in accordance with the above requirements determination of the amount of e coli bacteria is not required for raw water taken from the surface water environment hence the differences in the amounts of determinations for different groups of pathogens water collected directly from the river had not been tested for the presence of e coli therefore the assessment of treatment effectiveness was not conducted for this bacterium overall the following number of samples were analyzed in the study period 2445 water samples analyzed for coliforms bacteria 2228 for escherichia coli 1811 for clostridium perfringens and 2489 for enterococcus faecalis microbiological tests were conducted in an accredited water and wastewater testing laboratory accreditation no ab 980 using the plate method deep culture and membrane filtration method based on standard pn en iso 7899 2 2004 for enterococcus faecalis and standard pn en iso 9308 1 2014 12 a1 2017 04 for coliforms bacteria and escherichia coli and in accordance with directive 98 83 ec 56 for clostridium perfringens in force during the collection of research material in 2015 2019 currently directive eu 2020 2184 57 a total of 8973 samples were tested including 4370 from wtps and 4603 from wtpss water sent directly to the water supply network comprised 61 of samples collected at wtps and 58 of samples collected at wtpss 4 results and discussion the first step of the analysis involved the assessment of microbiological contamination variability in water collected directly from the dunajec river stage i figs 2 and 3 constituting the main water supply source for wtps and wtpss and in water collected from infiltration wells for each of the wtp studied stage ii figs 3 and 4 next test results obtained after the primary purification of water in settling tanks and dynasand self cleaning sand filters were analyzed stage iii figs 2 and 3 finally the results of tests on completely treated water sent to the water supply network were studied stage iv figs 2 and 3 4 1 microbiological status of surface and ground water supplied to wtp raw water collected directly from the dunajec river stage i both at wpts and wtpss contained the highest number of coliforms bacteria all values expressed as colony forming units cfu 100 ml compared to all the other bacterial groups studied in the water collected at wtps the annual average values ranged from 1145 to 1482 cfu 100 ml the average for the entire 5 year period was 1339 cfu 100 ml whereas in the water collected at wtpss this was 1211 1402 cfu 100 ml the average for the entire 5 year period was 1338 cfu 100 ml the number of enterococcus faecalis in the surface water samples at wtps ranged from 153 to 243 cfu and at wtpss this was 156 288 cfu 100 ml figs 4 and 5 both coliforms bacteria and enterococcus faecalis enter surface watercourses mainly with domestic and industrial wastewater flowing down from unsewered areas located above water intake points these bacteria are an indicator of fecal contamination originating especially from leaking waste collection tanks septic tanks leaking sewage systems or illegal dumping of pollutants directly into surface water or ground this situation also reflects the microbiological status of smaller streams and river tributaries in the entire basin 8 the dunajec is an example of a mountain river these watercourses are characterized by irregular flows combined with spring flood waves the flood waters carry large amounts of heterotrophic bacteria responsible for the decomposition of organic compounds 58 60 the recorded decrease in the maximum numbers of coliforms bacteria in water collected at wtps from 5872 cfu 100 ml in 2017 2280 cfu 100 ml in 2019 requires further observation to allow for an objective assessment as to whether there really is a downward dependency in the microbiological contamination of water no such dependency was observed with regard to coliforms bacteria at wtpss however there was a significant decrease in the number of enterococcus faecalis colonies the highest value of 1260 cfu 100 ml observed in 2016 was gradually reduced to 1020 and 710 cfu 100 ml n 2017 and 2018 respectively to finally reach the mere 420 cfu 100 ml in 2019 the presence of enterococcus faecalis in the water points to the so called old contamination with fecal matter 61 thus it can be inferred that uncontrolled dumping of domestic and industrial wastewater in the dunajec basin has been a long term process which nevertheless shows a relative improvement a significant increase in the number of clostridium perfringens was observed in 2019 compared to the previous years an average number of this bacteria recorded in water drawn directly from the river for the purposes of wtpss was 302 cfu 100 ml whereas in the previous years this value ranged from 132 to 173 cfu 100 ml in the case of wtps the number of clostridium perfringens increased from 115 to 155 cfu 100 ml in 2015 2018 to 278 cfu 100 ml in 2019 due to the presence of coliforms bacteria and enterococcos faecalis the dunajec river at the level of both wtps and wtpss intakes was classified as a2 a in the years 2015 2019 62 and requires accordingly in the case of class a 2 physical and chemical treatment especially pre oxidation coagulation flocculation decantation filtration and disinfection final chlorination in the case of class a 3 high performance physical and chemical treatment especially oxidation coagulation flocculation decantation filtration adsorption on activated carbon and disinfection ozonation final chlorination at stage ii of the water treatment process the analysis of results obtained for collective samples taken from infiltration wells at wtps and wtpss demonstrated that the infiltration processes applied is effective the microbiologically contaminated water drawn directly from the river is effectively purified in the soil layer at wtps and wtpss table 3 and is subsequently sent to the technological system through the wells in the case of wtps the effectiveness of removing individual bacterial species in the study period was as follows coliforms bacteria minimum effectiveness 75 93 maximum effectiveness 100 the average for the 5 year period 99 10 enterococcus faecalis minimum effectiveness 86 67 maximum effectiveness 100 the average for the 5 year period 99 30 clostridium perfringens minimum effectiveness 64 44 maximum effectiveness 100 the average for the 5 year period 98 97 in the case of wtpss the minimum and maximum levels of pathogen removal effectiveness were as follows coliforms bacteria 93 50 100 the average 99 83 enterococcus faecalis 95 38 100 the average 99 88 and clostridium perfringens 100 the results indicate a decisively higher effectiveness at wtpss compared to that at wtps in removing clostridium perfringens and a slightly higher effectiveness in removing coliforms bacteria and enterococcus faecalis however these differences are minor and it may be stated that both wtp present very high effectiveness in removing individual pathogens from water infiltrated in the soil through the irrigation ditch at wtps and infiltration basins at wtpss and from water supplying the infiltration wells as compared to water collected directly from the river this is because infiltration is a natural reagent free purification process using a soil layer as a multi functional reactor where physical chemical and biochemical processes take place 27 which effectively remove pathogenic microorganisms especially pathogenic bacteria from water 53 61 based on the analysis of test results obtained in the years 2015 2019 for stage ii it was found that table 1 and table 2 in the case of wtps 29 of samples of raw water collected from the infiltration wells were not contaminated with coliforms bacteria whereas only 2 of the 117 samples of water collected from the surface intake supplying this plant did not show contamination with any of the bacteria from this group in a 100 ml sample in the case of wtpss as much as 62 of samples of raw water collected from the infiltration wells were not contaminated with coliforms bacteria but each of the 112 samples of surface water was contaminated with bacteria from this group a similar correlation was also observed for the other pathogens escherichia coli clostridium perfringens and enterococcus faecalis as regards water collected from the wells at wtps the presence of these bacteria was not detected in 44 62 and 62 of samples respectively in the case of wtpss the bacteria were not detected in 8 62 and 96 of samples respectively all samples collected from the surface intake at wtps were contaminated with clostridium perfringens and enterococcus faecalis colonies at wtpss only 2 of samples did not show contamination with clostridium perfringens the differences in the levels of microorganism removal by means of infiltration used at wtps and wtpss can essentially be explained by the difference in the construction of the ditch and infiltration basins and the variable time of water flow through soil ground water infiltration at wtps is takes place in an open ditch the wells are located along the ditch in a close distance to it about 25 m which considerably shortens the time of horizontal water flow through the aquifer to the wells what is also important is the fact of long term about 60 years use of the intake in contrast to the newly constructed infiltration intake at wtpss which was launched in 2012 the 16 infiltration wells supplying water to wtpss are located in a considerable distance from one another in the so called irrigation basin fields in the area of the dunajec alluvial terrace both the intakes on the other hand are characterized by an aquifer composed of coarse and fine gravel deposits with high flow rates however these are relatively higher in the case of wtps where the average filtration coefficient k av 330 8 m d as of 2018 63 whereas for wtpss the value is k av 56 8 m d 2015 64 the results obtained for the infiltration wells at the two wtp were compared with those for private household wells in southern poland studied in the years 2015 2018 a study by 7 found that 80 of samples were contaminated with coliform bacteria 65 with clostridium perfringens and 36 with escherichia coli the average levels of bacterial contamination in water collected from the private wells were as follows 60 cfu 100 ml clostridium perfringens max 1 250 cfu 100 ml 803 cfu 100 ml coliforms bacteria max 5 612 cfu 100 ml and 56 cfu 100 ml escherichia coli max 4 100 cfu 100 ml the results of tests conducted on water collected from the infiltration wells supplying both wtp were significantly better table 1 and table 2 in the case of wtps the average values were lower by 55 for coliforms bacteria 83 for clostridium perfringens and in the case of wtpss by 100 for all the pathogens studied for drinking water sources in pakistan similar results were obtained by shafqat et at 65 and amin et al 66 the studies of amin et al 66 showed the presence of bacteria in 96 of the samples tested additionally interviews with residents confirmed the strong link between the levels of water contamination recorded and water borne infectious diseases similar conclusions were also found by chalchisa et al 67 for drinking water in ethiopia the next research step involved a comparative assessment of the presence of pathogenic bacteria in water collected directly from the river and infiltration wells at both wtp depending on the season and the related temperatures and humidity no significant seasonal variability in the presence of the pathogens analyzed was observed in water collected directly from the river at either wtps or wtpss figs 4 and 5 in all the periods analyzed the level of microbiological contamination was almost constant the average number of coliforms bacteria was about 1300 cfu 100 ml in the wtps intake and 1262 cfu 100 ml in the wtpss intake and these results clearly differed from those obtained for the other bacterial species analyzed a different distribution of test results was observed for samples collected from the infiltration wells at wtps fig 6 and fig 7 in this case the level of contamination was also determined by the presence of coliforms bacteria however the survival of the pathogens over time significantly differed from that observed in water collected directly from the river bacterial proliferation in well water was highest in april and may and growing again in the winter this might have been caused by a leaking sewage system or septic tanks the increase in the amount of coliforms clostridium perfringens and enterococcos faecalis in the water from the dunajec river irrigates the wtps and wtpss infiltration wells each time in a short period of time increases the amount of bacteria in the water taken from the infiltration wells figs 6 and 7 the percentage share of individual types of pathogens in the total number for water collected from both the river and infiltration wells is very similar they are present in the following decreasing order coliforms bacteria clostridium perfringens enterococcos faecalis 4 2 assessment of the effectiveness of the intermediate and final stages of water treatment the next step involved analyzing test results obtained after the intermediate stage of water treatment at both wtp i e samples collected after the primary purification in the settling tanks and dynasand self cleaning sand filters stage iii in the case of wtps the average level of microbial removal from water purified in the settling tanks and sand filters in the years 2015 2019 as compared to raw water was 99 44 for coliforms bacteria 99 79 for clostridium perfringens and as much as 99 95 for enterococcus faecalis the minimum level of microbial removal effectiveness in the sand filters displayed only slight differences as compared to the average effectiveness levels and ranged from 98 55 for coliforms bacteria through 98 93 for clostridium perfringens to as much as 99 31 for enterococcus faecalis in the case of wtpss the average level of microbial removal from water purified in the sand filters as compared to the original content of pathogens in raw water from the river was 95 95 for coliforms bacteria 97 16 for clostridium perfringens and 90 28 for enterococcus faecalis on the other hand the minimum level of microbial removal effectiveness in the settling tanks and sand filters ranged from 86 01 for coliforms bacteria through 80 65 for clostridium perfringens to 59 51 for enterococcus faecalis the differences in the effectiveness of removing individual microorganisms in the settling tanks and sand filters between wtps and wtpss stem from several technological factors at wtps surface water collected from the river after passing through the horizontal settling tanks is mixed with water drawn from 16 wells presenting very good physicochemical and bacteriological parameters and then continuously filtered through 12 dynasand filters thus being diluted in a ratio of 60 of surface water from the river passed through the primary settling tanks and 40 of water from 16 infiltration wells at wtpss surface water having passed through the primary settling tanks is filtered through 10 dynasand sand filters whereas water collected from 16 infiltration wells bypasses these filters for the most part of the year the differences in the quality of the filtrates are also related to the number of filters used at wtps 12 pcs and wtpss 10 pcs which additionally affects water retention time in these filters at wtps due to lower flows and a greater number of filters the time of water contact with the filter bed is about 1 h whereas at wtpss this time is much shorter and ranges between 20 and 40 min despite the technological differences the effectiveness of reducing microbiological parameters in both the plants is at a very high level which is an additional effect to the main goal of filtration on dynasand filters i e effective improvement of physicochemical parameters of water especially its turbidity color and presence of heavy metals and organic compounds the obtained results demonstrated that the level of the microbiological pathogens analyzed is significantly reduced after water purification in the primary settling tanks and sand filters 68 therefore the next research step involved the assessment of the pathogenic presence in water that passed through the entire technological system i e water sent directly to the water supply network after the process of disinfection with uv light and gas chlorine stage iv in all samples of treated water that were collected and tested the number of the pathogens analyzed was 0 cfu 100 ml which denotes 100 effectiveness of disinfection for each of the samples the study showed that the process of disinfection with uv light and gas chlorine used at wtps and wtpss is conducted in a proper and stable way it needs to be emphasized that differing levels of microbial and viral resistance to treatment processes are an important criterion for safety assessment to be considered in the process of broadly defined water disinfection alveolates from the cryptosporidium genus present a considerably higher resistance to chemical processes than viruses and bacteria 69 a much higher resistance to uv light disinfection is also observed in rotaviruses rna viruses which do not have a lipid envelope 25 the obtained results were compared with the research works of other scientists who had been dealing with on the epidemic safety of water in the last few years akrong et al 70 in their research work investigated the bacteriological contamination of water from lakes streams and boreholes providing drinking water for local people in the region of the bosomtwe crater lake in africa the obtained results showed microbiological contamination especially during the dry season which discriminates against their use for drinking purposes the analysis of the state of knowledge has proven that there is still little research work based on the results of working technological systems of water treatment the authors emphasize the need to strengthen the cooperation of the scientific side with water companies towards the common goal of the safety of water treatment and distribution systems nevertheless in the field of bacteriological assessment of collective water supply systems interesting studies were conducted by the team of mohammed hameed and sidu 71 in the field of predictive prediction of bacteriological contamination of drinking water in norway the model approach to the above issue has very perspective chances of using water treatment systems in risk management also farhat et al 72 simpson hayes 73 aish 74 ciuła et al 75 rybicki wiewiórska 76 dealt with an attempt to solve the problem of rapid response in the event of microbial contamination of drinking water in their work they proposed an online sensor system for bacteriological contamination of water in a water treatment plant and in the water supply network the research results obtained in the research work constitute an interesting material for the operators of critical facilities which undoubtedly include water intakes and water treatment plants knowing how to assess the effectiveness of individual water treatment technology processes is an important aspect of designing performing and conducting technological processes 5 conclusions based on the analyses conducted it was found that 1 the level of bacteriological contamination of river water is mainly determined by the number of fecal bacteria i e coliforms bacteria and enterococcus faecalis 2 the process of soil infiltration is highly effective in removing pathogenic bacteria 99 on average and may present an alternative to intermediate processes of water treatment comparable to filtration on dynasand filters 3 in terms of the temperature and humidity conditions in individual seasons of the year spring summer fall winter the microbiological contamination levels in the aqueous environment were practically constant 4 the proportion of individual types of pathogens in water from both the river and infiltration wells does not change significantly in individual quarters and presents the following order coliforms bacteria clostridium perfringens enterococcos faecalis 5 the differences in the effectiveness of pathogen removal in the infiltration layer between the two water treatment plants stem from the geological structure of the region where the water intakes are located and the difference in the construction of the ditch and infiltration basins which results in a variable time of water flow to the wells and a longer time of water retention in soil 6 a high level of removing the indicator microbes was observed at the intermediate stage of water treatment i e primary coagulation in settling tanks and filtration on sand filters 7 following subsequent technological processes namely disinfection with uv light and gas chlorine or ozonation and filtration on activated carbon there was a 100 reduction in microbiological pathogens in the water analyzed which is an essential requirement to ensure the safety of drinking water 8 high effectiveness of intermediate water treatment stages especially final disinfection processes using uv light and gas chlorine ensures 100 epidemiological safety of water sent to the recipients 9 who research confirms the relationship between properly conducted water treatment processes primarily disinfection with the use of ozone uv rays and chlorine gas and the presence of pathogenic indicator bacteria and viruses in the water author s

8781,critical infrastructure facilities play an important role in ensuring the safety of human life the present paper provides an overview of the legal framework for critical infrastructure facilities regarding protection against epidemiological risk based on test results for treated and raw water samples n 8973 and samples collected in water treatment plants at individual stages of the technological process the effectiveness of water treatment processes used at the plants was assessed with regard to selected pathogens i e coliforms bacteria escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis and clostridium perfringens it was demonstrated that the level of bacteriological contamination of river water is mainly determined by the number of fecal bacteria coliforms bacteria and enterococcus faecalis and the proportion of individual types of pathogens in water from both the river and infiltration wells does not change significantly throughout the year and presents the following order coliforms bacteria clostridium perfringens enterococcos faecalis it was shown that the process of soil infiltration is highly effective in removing pathogenic bacteria 99 on average and may present an alternative to intermediate processes of water treatment comparable to filtration on dynasand filters the level of microbial removal was high at the intermediate stage of water treatment i e preliminary coagulation in settling tanks and filtration on sand filters following subsequent technological processes namely disinfection with uv light and gas chlorine or ozonation and filtration on activated carbon there was a 100 reduction in microbiological pathogens in the water analyzed which is an essential requirement to ensure the safety of drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords critical infrastructure water treatment processes drinking water microbiological pathogens 1 introduction 1 1 microbial pathogens and viruses that generate water sanitation currently global discussions on the security of collective water supply are provoked more and more often the social responsibility of operators of water sources water treatment plants and water supply networks requires them to undertake serious actions aimed at providing safety and adequate quality of the services they offer water supply companies responsible for providing a unique product i e water must adhere to strict qualitative and quantitative criteria 1 3 however last year saw a number of alarming signals pointing to the dissemination of information which might have confused water recipients as regards their epidemiological safety related to drinking water supply 5 viruses and bacteria are widespread in the aqueous environment 4 the most common pathogenic bacteria found in water are coliforms bacteria escherichia coli enterococcus faecalis and clostridium perfringens 5 the indicated pathogens are detected in surface waters in all parts of the world and are considered indicators of bacteriological contamination of waters 6 the main source of their occurrence is pollution of faecal water soil environment leaky septic tanks illegal sewage discharges into ditches and fields despite the increase in sewerage in large areas including rural areas there is still a problem that residents do not use collective sewage collection and treatment systems 7 in addition to the above mentioned types of bacteria water can be contaminated with among others staphylococcus aureus bacteria 8 the impact of the identified most common pathogens on human health and sanitary safety is enormous they can cause the so called water related diseases diarrhea dysentery stomach problems body infections typhoid in addition the widespread use of antibiotics and the appearance of their residues in the environment may contribute to the spread of bacterial resistance 9 11 water borne viruses posing a risk to human health include polioviruses causing poliomyelitis rotaviruses particularly dangerous for children and infants adenoviruses astroviruses enteroviruses including hepatitis a virus papillomaviruses oncogenic and hepatovirus e causing hepatitis e 12 14 there are numerous factors determining the number and forms of microorganisms and their survival in the aqueous environment including temperature insolation season of the year and humidity 4 5 the main methods of inactivating microbial and viral pathogens from water are disinfection using uv lamps chlorine gas or ozonation methods that do not result in the formation of harmful products of chemical processes are introduced more and more often i e the use of artificial filtration and membrane technologies 15 18 one of the most important aspects to microbiological safety of collective water supply processes is the water disinfection monitoring system 19 20 disinfection is usually the last very important stage of water treatment or constitutes one of water purification processes providing protection against secondary water contamination in the water supply system the main goal of water disinfection is the removal of pathogenic organisms and their spores from water 21 22 the main disinfectants used in water treatment plants wtp are gas chlorine cl2 sodium hypochlorite naocl and chlorine dioxide clo2 23 another common method is physical disinfection with uv light 22 24 25 ultraviolet non ionizing radiation affects the adsorption of the ribonucleic acid of the virus into other chemical structures resulting in its inactivation 4 enveloped viruses are less stable in an aquatic environment and highly susceptible to disinfection processes such as oxidation with chlorine 26 processes that support the removal of pathogenic microorganisms from water are soil infiltration filtration coagulation and flocculation oxidation and adsorption 21 27 28 filtration is one of the most effective processes of treating all types of water used in water supply systems allowing for the removal of particles smaller that the pores between the granules in the filtering bed 29 most often high values of the following parameters turbidity color and the levels of planktonic organisms bacteria and viruses are decisive in choosing coagulation sedimentation filtration oxidation and disinfection as key processes in treating water intended for human consumption 5 30 a crucial role in the process of treating microbiologically contaminated water is played by primary and intermediate treatment processes as they guarantee effective disinfection with both uv light and gas chlorine 31 modern water treatment processes allow for limiting the spread of various epidemic diseases caused by microbiological pathogens 21 32 33 in accordance with the currently applicable regulation of the minister of health 34 water supply companies are not obliged to test for the presence of viruses in water however numerous cyclical analyses of microbiological contamination especially of fecal origin allow for detecting potential health hazard hotspots as regards drinking water additionally safety procedures and the existing and newly introduced water treatment technologies are regularly verified also in terms of the epidemiological safety of collective water supply the study described in the present paper focused on the assessment of the effectiveness of water treatment processes used in two wtp located in southern poland cee in stary sącz wtpss and in świniarsko wtps in terms of deactivating microbiological pathogens whose presence was reported in the years 2015 2019 in the present paper the following elements have been analyzed i presence of microbiological pathogens in surface and ground water collected at the two water treatment plants ii characteristics of seasonal variability of pathogens in surface and ground water iii effectiveness of water treatment processes and health security of water recipients as regards the presence of 4 selected pathogens the research objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of water treatment processes carried out in a water supply company due to the presence of microbiological pathogens that may cause an epidemic threat the indicated research goal is important from the point of view of the scientific community to collect the current state of knowledge on the resistance of water treatment technology systems to the epidemic threat of water carrying microbiological pathogens the paper addresses a relevant and topical problem of bacteriological epidemic safety of water mainly related to the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in water intended for human consumption 35 36 the research purpose indicated in the manuscript is important from the perspective of both new data and implementation value studies published to date on infectious diseases caused by microbiological pathogens present in the aquatic environment have largely focused on the analyses of bacteriological contamination of waste water released from the treatment plant to the environment and its disinfection 37 42 however enterprises responsible for providing a food product in the form of drinking water are obliged to meet specific quality requirements with regard to their products thus the paper discusses the problem faced by water intake operators namely their obligation to obtain specified levels of pathogen inactivation already during the preliminary and intermediate technological processes of water treatment which also include natural treatment methods like soil infiltration the main application value of this paper is the in depth research on the reduction of microorganisms in the preliminary and intermediate water treatment processes rather than only in their final stage of physical and chemical disinfection the majority of the papers published to date focus solely on the effectiveness of the final disinfection of water with the use of physical methods uv light and chemical reagents such as gas chlorine chlorine dioxide sodium hypochlorite and ozone and on the disinfection by products dbps formed as a result of a reaction between disinfecting agents and naturally occurring organic matter bromides and iodides and anthropogenic pollutants 43 45 the authors of the present paper went a step further by analysing and calculating the percentage reduction in the number of microorganisms at individual water treatment stages including those involving soil infiltration volumetric coagulation in vertical settling tanks and filtration on dynasand sand filters the paper compares the effectiveness of microbial removal in two independent technological systems taking into account both the type of water collected from the environment and the differences in the water treatment technology used which additionally increases the cognitive value of this research in the technical context a major advantage of the work is that the long term results come from water treatment plants operating on a dynamic technical scale rather than from laboratory experiments or micro installations at water treatment plants our analysis of the current state of knowledge has revealed that there are not many scientific papers based on the results obtained from dynamically operating technological systems at water treatment plants furthermore the results presented in the paper may be of interest to researchers representing other scientific fields e g ichthyologists ecologists the results pertain to the river water from a considerable basin area over 6800 km2 the sanitary condition of the river water might present a threat not only to the life and health of the inhabitants but also to the ichtyofauna and the ecological potential of the river it also needs to be emphasized that the majority of the basin area is legally protected natura 2000 and landscape park areas the authors emphasize that in light of constantly emerging challenges and new threats to critical infrastructure security the subject discussed requires further in depth research without comprehensive analyses of the existing water treatment processes it is impossible to objectively assess the degree of safety and security in case of emergencies including epidemic emergencies these should be long term analyses demonstrating a multiannual picture of risk reduction and the nature of the emerging quantitative and qualitative positive negative trends 1 2 legal framework for critical infrastructure facilities regarding protection against epidemiological and sanitary risk in poland critical infrastructure comprises assets that are used to satisfy the needs of all citizens and undoubtedly includes systems of collective water supply 46 these are technical facilities whose proper operation guarantees health security of consumers who use the drinking water supplied pursuant to the act on collective water supply applicable in poland 47 water supply and sewage management companies are obliged to provide continuous supply of water presenting appropriate required quality supervised by the national sanitary inspectorate to maintain occupational safety of these facilities and systems relevant supervisory units need to assume enormous social responsibility which is put to the test especially in situations of emergency such as the epidemiological risk emergencies or epidemic emergencies pursuant to the provisions laid down in the act on prevention and control of infections and infectious diseases in humans 48 an epidemiological risk emergency is a situation that has been legally enforced due to the risk of an epidemic outbreak an epidemic emergency on the other hand is a situation that has been legally enforced due to the existing epidemic in order to undertake legally defined preventive and anti epidemic actions that would minimize negative effects of the epidemic procedures for actions to be undertaken in situations of emergency including those of epidemiological risk are defined in the act on crisis management 49 a particularly important task for water supply and sewage management companies is to introduce technical systemic and organizational solutions that provide protection against epidemiological risk and its consequences and organize appropriate employee training in this field a legislative document addressing the issue of protection critical infrastructure is the act on extraordinary solutions to prevent mitigate and combat covid 19 and other infectious diseases and the ensuing crisis situations 50 based on this legal act managers of critical infrastructure facilities and systems were given additional rights and responsibilities during the time of an emergency in order to ensure secure operation of these facilities if necessary managers of critical infrastructure can enter third party owned premises or property housing the infrastructure mentioned assisted by police officers if the owners refuse such entry such action is necessary to ensure continuous operation of these facilities including water supply maintenance works or failure repair according to the provisions of the act critical facility managers can introduce changes in the work organization at these facilities to ensure their continuous operation and thus continuous security of service recipients among documents allowing for identification of potential emergencies and risks that can affect the public health are water safety plans wsp these manuals when responsibly and thoroughly developed are an integral element of critical infrastructure facilities preparedness for various situations such as an epidemic they form a part of the recommended preventive approach towards risk management 19 the current operational procedures for water supply and sewage management companies both in times of regular operation and emergency and crisis situations allow for maintaining security of the services provided 2 characteristics of the study area the study was conducted in two water treatment plants wtp located in southern poland the first wtp analyzed is located in stary sącz wtpss and the second in świniarsko wtps they are both supplied with water from river bed infiltration and surface left and right bank intake points on the dunajec river additionally wtps takes water from infiltration wells and an irrigation ditch whereas wtpss uses a system of artificial infiltration basins 51 53 fig 1 present localization of wtps and wtpss the dunajec is a large mountain river characterized by seasonal flow variability especially after winter snowmelt and variable physicochemical water composition including significant changes in turbidity suspension size and organic matter content 22 the fluctuations in water turbidity are the outcome of water treatment processes and determine reagent dosing information on the quality status of the river is derived from state monitoring data and test results obtained in the course of monitoring water sources and wastewater treatment plants 54 the areas directly adjacent to the intakes are mainly fields meadows and single family housing this is reflected in the origin of the bacteria that are found in the water soil environment mainly of fecal origin wtps and wtpss which served as sampling sites are critical infrastructure facilities within the system of collective water supply which serves over 100 000 recipients as of december 31 2019 both these plants apply the most extensive water treatment processes comprising 3 and 4 steps respectively in the technological process used at wtps non treated raw water from the surface intake point p 1 fig 2 is directed to two open horizontal settling tanks p 4 1 and 4 2 where the processes of volumetric coagulation and sedimentation take place water taken from the river is passed to the irrigation ditch from which it artificially feeds the infiltration intake comprising a system of 16 wells p 6 with the total capacity of 7000 m3 d such primarily purified water is pumped into 12 dynasand continuous sand filters p 7 where the process of contact coagulation takes place after treatment on the sand filters the water together with the water from 11 deep water wells with max capacity of 4000 m3 d p 8 is disinfected with uv light p 9 and chlorine gas p 11 the maximum capacity of wtps is 16 800 m3 d wtpss draws water directly from the river via river bed infiltration intake p 1 fig 3 and from infiltration wells supplied with surface water p 5 all of the water in this plant maximum capacity of 500 m3 h is subjected to the treatment process the water is pumped from the collection chambers p 2 into two vertical settling tanks where volumetric coagulation takes place p 3 1 and 3 2 and then directed to 10 dynasand continuous self cleaning filters p 6 where contact coagulation is carried out next the water flows into a contact tank where it is ozonated p 7 after this process the water is pumped into eight pressure filters with an activated carbon bed p 8 after filtration the water is disinfected with uv light and gas chlorine p 9 and 10 the part of water that remains in the collection chambers is pumped into a system of three infiltration basins p 4 after soil infiltration the water is collected at about 190 m3 h by submersible pumps installed in 16 well holes next the water is subjected to subsequent treatment steps depending on its quality ozonation sorption on carbon filters together with uv light and gas chlorine disinfection or additionally filtration on dynasand filters together with other treatment processes thus treated water is collected in four clean water tanks p 11 1 11 4 and pumped into the water supply network p 13 delivering drinking water to consumers 24 the current water production stemming from the inhabitants demand ranges from 9 000 m3 d to 10 000 m3 d the maximum capacity of wtpss is 14 000 m3 d 25 3 materials and methods the effectiveness of the technological water treatment processes in reducing the numbers of bacteria was assessed based on the analysis of test results obtained in the years 2015 2019 the tests had been conducted on water drawn directly from the river and from the infiltration basins water samples collected at individual treatment stages and finally treated water pumped into the water supply network figs 2 and 3 water samples were collected from both wtp at 4 stages stage i from 2 surface water intakes on the dunajec river n 708 including 358 samples from wtps and 350 from wtpss with a frequency of twice a month stage ii from 2 infiltration intake systems n 1142 including 465 collective samples from infiltration wells at wtps and 677 collective samples from wells at wtpss with a frequency of once a week stage iii after treatment in primary settling tanks and sand filters n 1789 including 886 from wtps and 903 from wtpss with a frequency of once every 2 weeks stage iv after the entire treatment process n 5334 including 2661 from wtps and 2673 from wtpss with a frequency of once a week the samples collected were tested for the presence of four types of pathogens 1 coliforms bacteria 2 escherichia coli 3 clostridium perfringens and 4 enterococcus faecalis the frequency of sampling was determined by the wtp monitoring schedule for each of the pathogens listed table 1 and table 2 in accordance with the requirements set out in the water law and the regulation 55 of the minister of health 34 it should be mentioned that the sampling schedule is always agreed with the state sanitary inspector in accordance with the above requirements determination of the amount of e coli bacteria is not required for raw water taken from the surface water environment hence the differences in the amounts of determinations for different groups of pathogens water collected directly from the river had not been tested for the presence of e coli therefore the assessment of treatment effectiveness was not conducted for this bacterium overall the following number of samples were analyzed in the study period 2445 water samples analyzed for coliforms bacteria 2228 for escherichia coli 1811 for clostridium perfringens and 2489 for enterococcus faecalis microbiological tests were conducted in an accredited water and wastewater testing laboratory accreditation no ab 980 using the plate method deep culture and membrane filtration method based on standard pn en iso 7899 2 2004 for enterococcus faecalis and standard pn en iso 9308 1 2014 12 a1 2017 04 for coliforms bacteria and escherichia coli and in accordance with directive 98 83 ec 56 for clostridium perfringens in force during the collection of research material in 2015 2019 currently directive eu 2020 2184 57 a total of 8973 samples were tested including 4370 from wtps and 4603 from wtpss water sent directly to the water supply network comprised 61 of samples collected at wtps and 58 of samples collected at wtpss 4 results and discussion the first step of the analysis involved the assessment of microbiological contamination variability in water collected directly from the dunajec river stage i figs 2 and 3 constituting the main water supply source for wtps and wtpss and in water collected from infiltration wells for each of the wtp studied stage ii figs 3 and 4 next test results obtained after the primary purification of water in settling tanks and dynasand self cleaning sand filters were analyzed stage iii figs 2 and 3 finally the results of tests on completely treated water sent to the water supply network were studied stage iv figs 2 and 3 4 1 microbiological status of surface and ground water supplied to wtp raw water collected directly from the dunajec river stage i both at wpts and wtpss contained the highest number of coliforms bacteria all values expressed as colony forming units cfu 100 ml compared to all the other bacterial groups studied in the water collected at wtps the annual average values ranged from 1145 to 1482 cfu 100 ml the average for the entire 5 year period was 1339 cfu 100 ml whereas in the water collected at wtpss this was 1211 1402 cfu 100 ml the average for the entire 5 year period was 1338 cfu 100 ml the number of enterococcus faecalis in the surface water samples at wtps ranged from 153 to 243 cfu and at wtpss this was 156 288 cfu 100 ml figs 4 and 5 both coliforms bacteria and enterococcus faecalis enter surface watercourses mainly with domestic and industrial wastewater flowing down from unsewered areas located above water intake points these bacteria are an indicator of fecal contamination originating especially from leaking waste collection tanks septic tanks leaking sewage systems or illegal dumping of pollutants directly into surface water or ground this situation also reflects the microbiological status of smaller streams and river tributaries in the entire basin 8 the dunajec is an example of a mountain river these watercourses are characterized by irregular flows combined with spring flood waves the flood waters carry large amounts of heterotrophic bacteria responsible for the decomposition of organic compounds 58 60 the recorded decrease in the maximum numbers of coliforms bacteria in water collected at wtps from 5872 cfu 100 ml in 2017 2280 cfu 100 ml in 2019 requires further observation to allow for an objective assessment as to whether there really is a downward dependency in the microbiological contamination of water no such dependency was observed with regard to coliforms bacteria at wtpss however there was a significant decrease in the number of enterococcus faecalis colonies the highest value of 1260 cfu 100 ml observed in 2016 was gradually reduced to 1020 and 710 cfu 100 ml n 2017 and 2018 respectively to finally reach the mere 420 cfu 100 ml in 2019 the presence of enterococcus faecalis in the water points to the so called old contamination with fecal matter 61 thus it can be inferred that uncontrolled dumping of domestic and industrial wastewater in the dunajec basin has been a long term process which nevertheless shows a relative improvement a significant increase in the number of clostridium perfringens was observed in 2019 compared to the previous years an average number of this bacteria recorded in water drawn directly from the river for the purposes of wtpss was 302 cfu 100 ml whereas in the previous years this value ranged from 132 to 173 cfu 100 ml in the case of wtps the number of clostridium perfringens increased from 115 to 155 cfu 100 ml in 2015 2018 to 278 cfu 100 ml in 2019 due to the presence of coliforms bacteria and enterococcos faecalis the dunajec river at the level of both wtps and wtpss intakes was classified as a2 a in the years 2015 2019 62 and requires accordingly in the case of class a 2 physical and chemical treatment especially pre oxidation coagulation flocculation decantation filtration and disinfection final chlorination in the case of class a 3 high performance physical and chemical treatment especially oxidation coagulation flocculation decantation filtration adsorption on activated carbon and disinfection ozonation final chlorination at stage ii of the water treatment process the analysis of results obtained for collective samples taken from infiltration wells at wtps and wtpss demonstrated that the infiltration processes applied is effective the microbiologically contaminated water drawn directly from the river is effectively purified in the soil layer at wtps and wtpss table 3 and is subsequently sent to the technological system through the wells in the case of wtps the effectiveness of removing individual bacterial species in the study period was as follows coliforms bacteria minimum effectiveness 75 93 maximum effectiveness 100 the average for the 5 year period 99 10 enterococcus faecalis minimum effectiveness 86 67 maximum effectiveness 100 the average for the 5 year period 99 30 clostridium perfringens minimum effectiveness 64 44 maximum effectiveness 100 the average for the 5 year period 98 97 in the case of wtpss the minimum and maximum levels of pathogen removal effectiveness were as follows coliforms bacteria 93 50 100 the average 99 83 enterococcus faecalis 95 38 100 the average 99 88 and clostridium perfringens 100 the results indicate a decisively higher effectiveness at wtpss compared to that at wtps in removing clostridium perfringens and a slightly higher effectiveness in removing coliforms bacteria and enterococcus faecalis however these differences are minor and it may be stated that both wtp present very high effectiveness in removing individual pathogens from water infiltrated in the soil through the irrigation ditch at wtps and infiltration basins at wtpss and from water supplying the infiltration wells as compared to water collected directly from the river this is because infiltration is a natural reagent free purification process using a soil layer as a multi functional reactor where physical chemical and biochemical processes take place 27 which effectively remove pathogenic microorganisms especially pathogenic bacteria from water 53 61 based on the analysis of test results obtained in the years 2015 2019 for stage ii it was found that table 1 and table 2 in the case of wtps 29 of samples of raw water collected from the infiltration wells were not contaminated with coliforms bacteria whereas only 2 of the 117 samples of water collected from the surface intake supplying this plant did not show contamination with any of the bacteria from this group in a 100 ml sample in the case of wtpss as much as 62 of samples of raw water collected from the infiltration wells were not contaminated with coliforms bacteria but each of the 112 samples of surface water was contaminated with bacteria from this group a similar correlation was also observed for the other pathogens escherichia coli clostridium perfringens and enterococcus faecalis as regards water collected from the wells at wtps the presence of these bacteria was not detected in 44 62 and 62 of samples respectively in the case of wtpss the bacteria were not detected in 8 62 and 96 of samples respectively all samples collected from the surface intake at wtps were contaminated with clostridium perfringens and enterococcus faecalis colonies at wtpss only 2 of samples did not show contamination with clostridium perfringens the differences in the levels of microorganism removal by means of infiltration used at wtps and wtpss can essentially be explained by the difference in the construction of the ditch and infiltration basins and the variable time of water flow through soil ground water infiltration at wtps is takes place in an open ditch the wells are located along the ditch in a close distance to it about 25 m which considerably shortens the time of horizontal water flow through the aquifer to the wells what is also important is the fact of long term about 60 years use of the intake in contrast to the newly constructed infiltration intake at wtpss which was launched in 2012 the 16 infiltration wells supplying water to wtpss are located in a considerable distance from one another in the so called irrigation basin fields in the area of the dunajec alluvial terrace both the intakes on the other hand are characterized by an aquifer composed of coarse and fine gravel deposits with high flow rates however these are relatively higher in the case of wtps where the average filtration coefficient k av 330 8 m d as of 2018 63 whereas for wtpss the value is k av 56 8 m d 2015 64 the results obtained for the infiltration wells at the two wtp were compared with those for private household wells in southern poland studied in the years 2015 2018 a study by 7 found that 80 of samples were contaminated with coliform bacteria 65 with clostridium perfringens and 36 with escherichia coli the average levels of bacterial contamination in water collected from the private wells were as follows 60 cfu 100 ml clostridium perfringens max 1 250 cfu 100 ml 803 cfu 100 ml coliforms bacteria max 5 612 cfu 100 ml and 56 cfu 100 ml escherichia coli max 4 100 cfu 100 ml the results of tests conducted on water collected from the infiltration wells supplying both wtp were significantly better table 1 and table 2 in the case of wtps the average values were lower by 55 for coliforms bacteria 83 for clostridium perfringens and in the case of wtpss by 100 for all the pathogens studied for drinking water sources in pakistan similar results were obtained by shafqat et at 65 and amin et al 66 the studies of amin et al 66 showed the presence of bacteria in 96 of the samples tested additionally interviews with residents confirmed the strong link between the levels of water contamination recorded and water borne infectious diseases similar conclusions were also found by chalchisa et al 67 for drinking water in ethiopia the next research step involved a comparative assessment of the presence of pathogenic bacteria in water collected directly from the river and infiltration wells at both wtp depending on the season and the related temperatures and humidity no significant seasonal variability in the presence of the pathogens analyzed was observed in water collected directly from the river at either wtps or wtpss figs 4 and 5 in all the periods analyzed the level of microbiological contamination was almost constant the average number of coliforms bacteria was about 1300 cfu 100 ml in the wtps intake and 1262 cfu 100 ml in the wtpss intake and these results clearly differed from those obtained for the other bacterial species analyzed a different distribution of test results was observed for samples collected from the infiltration wells at wtps fig 6 and fig 7 in this case the level of contamination was also determined by the presence of coliforms bacteria however the survival of the pathogens over time significantly differed from that observed in water collected directly from the river bacterial proliferation in well water was highest in april and may and growing again in the winter this might have been caused by a leaking sewage system or septic tanks the increase in the amount of coliforms clostridium perfringens and enterococcos faecalis in the water from the dunajec river irrigates the wtps and wtpss infiltration wells each time in a short period of time increases the amount of bacteria in the water taken from the infiltration wells figs 6 and 7 the percentage share of individual types of pathogens in the total number for water collected from both the river and infiltration wells is very similar they are present in the following decreasing order coliforms bacteria clostridium perfringens enterococcos faecalis 4 2 assessment of the effectiveness of the intermediate and final stages of water treatment the next step involved analyzing test results obtained after the intermediate stage of water treatment at both wtp i e samples collected after the primary purification in the settling tanks and dynasand self cleaning sand filters stage iii in the case of wtps the average level of microbial removal from water purified in the settling tanks and sand filters in the years 2015 2019 as compared to raw water was 99 44 for coliforms bacteria 99 79 for clostridium perfringens and as much as 99 95 for enterococcus faecalis the minimum level of microbial removal effectiveness in the sand filters displayed only slight differences as compared to the average effectiveness levels and ranged from 98 55 for coliforms bacteria through 98 93 for clostridium perfringens to as much as 99 31 for enterococcus faecalis in the case of wtpss the average level of microbial removal from water purified in the sand filters as compared to the original content of pathogens in raw water from the river was 95 95 for coliforms bacteria 97 16 for clostridium perfringens and 90 28 for enterococcus faecalis on the other hand the minimum level of microbial removal effectiveness in the settling tanks and sand filters ranged from 86 01 for coliforms bacteria through 80 65 for clostridium perfringens to 59 51 for enterococcus faecalis the differences in the effectiveness of removing individual microorganisms in the settling tanks and sand filters between wtps and wtpss stem from several technological factors at wtps surface water collected from the river after passing through the horizontal settling tanks is mixed with water drawn from 16 wells presenting very good physicochemical and bacteriological parameters and then continuously filtered through 12 dynasand filters thus being diluted in a ratio of 60 of surface water from the river passed through the primary settling tanks and 40 of water from 16 infiltration wells at wtpss surface water having passed through the primary settling tanks is filtered through 10 dynasand sand filters whereas water collected from 16 infiltration wells bypasses these filters for the most part of the year the differences in the quality of the filtrates are also related to the number of filters used at wtps 12 pcs and wtpss 10 pcs which additionally affects water retention time in these filters at wtps due to lower flows and a greater number of filters the time of water contact with the filter bed is about 1 h whereas at wtpss this time is much shorter and ranges between 20 and 40 min despite the technological differences the effectiveness of reducing microbiological parameters in both the plants is at a very high level which is an additional effect to the main goal of filtration on dynasand filters i e effective improvement of physicochemical parameters of water especially its turbidity color and presence of heavy metals and organic compounds the obtained results demonstrated that the level of the microbiological pathogens analyzed is significantly reduced after water purification in the primary settling tanks and sand filters 68 therefore the next research step involved the assessment of the pathogenic presence in water that passed through the entire technological system i e water sent directly to the water supply network after the process of disinfection with uv light and gas chlorine stage iv in all samples of treated water that were collected and tested the number of the pathogens analyzed was 0 cfu 100 ml which denotes 100 effectiveness of disinfection for each of the samples the study showed that the process of disinfection with uv light and gas chlorine used at wtps and wtpss is conducted in a proper and stable way it needs to be emphasized that differing levels of microbial and viral resistance to treatment processes are an important criterion for safety assessment to be considered in the process of broadly defined water disinfection alveolates from the cryptosporidium genus present a considerably higher resistance to chemical processes than viruses and bacteria 69 a much higher resistance to uv light disinfection is also observed in rotaviruses rna viruses which do not have a lipid envelope 25 the obtained results were compared with the research works of other scientists who had been dealing with on the epidemic safety of water in the last few years akrong et al 70 in their research work investigated the bacteriological contamination of water from lakes streams and boreholes providing drinking water for local people in the region of the bosomtwe crater lake in africa the obtained results showed microbiological contamination especially during the dry season which discriminates against their use for drinking purposes the analysis of the state of knowledge has proven that there is still little research work based on the results of working technological systems of water treatment the authors emphasize the need to strengthen the cooperation of the scientific side with water companies towards the common goal of the safety of water treatment and distribution systems nevertheless in the field of bacteriological assessment of collective water supply systems interesting studies were conducted by the team of mohammed hameed and sidu 71 in the field of predictive prediction of bacteriological contamination of drinking water in norway the model approach to the above issue has very perspective chances of using water treatment systems in risk management also farhat et al 72 simpson hayes 73 aish 74 ciuła et al 75 rybicki wiewiórska 76 dealt with an attempt to solve the problem of rapid response in the event of microbial contamination of drinking water in their work they proposed an online sensor system for bacteriological contamination of water in a water treatment plant and in the water supply network the research results obtained in the research work constitute an interesting material for the operators of critical facilities which undoubtedly include water intakes and water treatment plants knowing how to assess the effectiveness of individual water treatment technology processes is an important aspect of designing performing and conducting technological processes 5 conclusions based on the analyses conducted it was found that 1 the level of bacteriological contamination of river water is mainly determined by the number of fecal bacteria i e coliforms bacteria and enterococcus faecalis 2 the process of soil infiltration is highly effective in removing pathogenic bacteria 99 on average and may present an alternative to intermediate processes of water treatment comparable to filtration on dynasand filters 3 in terms of the temperature and humidity conditions in individual seasons of the year spring summer fall winter the microbiological contamination levels in the aqueous environment were practically constant 4 the proportion of individual types of pathogens in water from both the river and infiltration wells does not change significantly in individual quarters and presents the following order coliforms bacteria clostridium perfringens enterococcos faecalis 5 the differences in the effectiveness of pathogen removal in the infiltration layer between the two water treatment plants stem from the geological structure of the region where the water intakes are located and the difference in the construction of the ditch and infiltration basins which results in a variable time of water flow to the wells and a longer time of water retention in soil 6 a high level of removing the indicator microbes was observed at the intermediate stage of water treatment i e primary coagulation in settling tanks and filtration on sand filters 7 following subsequent technological processes namely disinfection with uv light and gas chlorine or ozonation and filtration on activated carbon there was a 100 reduction in microbiological pathogens in the water analyzed which is an essential requirement to ensure the safety of drinking water 8 high effectiveness of intermediate water treatment stages especially final disinfection processes using uv light and gas chlorine ensures 100 epidemiological safety of water sent to the recipients 9 who research confirms the relationship between properly conducted water treatment processes primarily disinfection with the use of ozone uv rays and chlorine gas and the presence of pathogenic indicator bacteria and viruses in the water author s

annual capacity of 100 000 tonnes of salt 16 the feed water for the plant comes from the budryk mine which is still in operation chemical treatment is not used two kinds of budryk waters are used intermediate one tds of 30 8 kg m3 and saline one tds of 72 7 kg m3 the intermediate budryk water is pre concentrated by reverse osmosis ro the ro retentate is mixed with the saline budryk water and fed to a vapour compression vc evaporator where it s concentrated to approximately 290 g dm3 as nacl the energy consumption of vc is 44 kwh m3 of distillate next the brine is directed to the vc crystallization evaporator which has energy consumption of 66 kwh m3 of distillate the application of integrated membrane systems could decrease the plant energy consumption and increase the salt recovery 17 there have been many proposals to improve the performance of dębieńsko with integrated membrane based systems 17 19 the zero brine project is a four year innovation action ia financed by the european commission it aims to close the loop and improve the environmental impact of industrial production by showing that raw materials can be recovered from industrial processes to then be reused in other industries one of the aims of the zero brine project is to demonstrate the circular economy solution in the coal mining industry this includes showing an innovative brine treatment at pilot scale the pilot plant in question demonstrating the zero brine technology developed and tested within the framework of this project was located in bolesław śmiały coal mine in łaziska górne poland a coal mine owned by pgg polska grupa górnicza s a the eu s largest black coal mining company producing annually approx 30 million tons of black coal total eu production 100 million tons the bolesław śmiały coal mine water surpasses the legal limits imposed on industrial waste waters so before the discharge it is mixed with industrial waste water from the energy plant sharing the same site there currently is no further treatment of discharge the technology proposed in the zero brine can mitigate the environmental problems related to the saline discharge the technology has the surplus value of extracting valuable products from the discharge reverse osmosis permeate of high purity which can be utilized in a nearby power plant and inorganic compounds such as magnesium hydroxide and salt which have commercial value the proposed scheme is as follows the feed coal mine water is being pre treated with ultrafiltration and decarbonization and is then subjected to a two pass nanofiltration treatment the nanofiltration unit splits the coal mine water into two streams salt rich permeate and calcium and magnesium rich retentate the retentate can be used in the recovery of magnesium hydroxide a valuable commodity in the refractory materials industry the remaining calcium rich solution can be used as a de icing liquid the nanofiltration permeate is concentrated in a hybrid reverse osmosis electrodialysis system which produces demineralized water of quality close to distilled water highly saline concentrate and the diluate which can be recycled either before the reverse osmosis or before the nanofiltration the highly saline concentrate can then be sold directly or used as a source for salt crystallization the aim of this study was to test the proposed technology in the pilot scale the pilot plant capable of treating 400 l h was designed by the silesian university of technology and built by the polymemtech the system was installed on 23 06 2019 and has been operated during the period of 24 06 2019 to 16 03 2020 to assess the plant performance the results obtained in the zero brine project were compared with the reference technology the desalination plant in czerwionka leszczyny poland formerly known as dębieńsko 2 experimental 2 1 feed water and sample analysis before the plant installation samples of raw coal mine water were

pass nanofiltration each nf pass consisted of two pressure vessels filled with two modules each trisep ts40 membranes were used reverse osmosis two stage electrodialysis two pc cell 1000a electrodialyzers connected in a cascade the general layout of the plant and sampling points can be seen in fig 1 the photos of the installed plant can be seen in fig 2 the retentate from the second pass of nanofiltration nf2 can either be recycled before the first pass of nanofiltration nf1 or discarded the diluate from the second stage of electrodialysis can be recycled either before the reverse osmosis ro or before the nf1 during the plant run the concentration of cl ca2 mg2 so4 2 na was determined in the process streams using the thermodionex ics 500 ion chromatograph equipped with a cs 16 as 19 columns 3 results 3 1 feed water analysis the results of semi quantitative analysis of bolesław śmiały water are presented in table s1 in the supplementary materials the only uncommon element found in the water is erbium however its concentration is very low ca 0 3 mg dm3 the presence of erbium may be a result of interference during the analysis the water has a low content of silica ca 1 4 mg dm3 as elemental si which was manageable in the pilot plant by a pretreatment system the amount of manganese is very low ca 0 1 mg dm3 and no iron has been detected which was a positive sign from the point of view of scaling risk in the pilot plant on the other hand there is strontium ca 1 6 mg dm3 which carries some scaling risk the concentration of major ionic compounds of water in question is presented in table s2 in the supplementary materials based on the results the relative gypsum saturation and the langelier saturation index lsi have been calculated assuming temperature of 25 c see table s3 in the supplementary materials high values of bicarbonate concentration may be a result of analytical errors in major components determination as bicarbonate is calculated based on ionic balance of solution the results show that bolesław śmiały water has a tds of ca 23 24 g dm3 and is saturated with calcium carbonate 3 2 two pass nanofiltration recovery in nanofiltration is limited by the risk of sparingly soluble salts crystallization in the retentate if that happens it would result in clogging the membrane modules and their malfunction in order to assess the maximum permissible recovery the retentate has been gradually chocked in the first pass nanofiltration nf1 and the hydraulic pressure drop i e the difference between retentate and feed has been monitored the sudden increase in this value would indicate blocking of the module by the deposits the recovery in the second pass nanofiltration nf2 was 80 the recovery of 60 70 and 80 has been studied in the first pass more endangered by the sparingly soluble salts crystallization no significant change in hydraulic pressure drop has been observed for the tested recovery range fig 3 work at higher recovery would be too risky because of existing supersaturation of calcium sulphate in the retentate at 80 recovery the retentate was already supersaturated but because of slow crystallization kinetics it only precipitated in the collected retentate samples after few hours the hydraulic residence time in nf module is lower than the time required for observing the macroscopic crystallization meaning it can be concluded that work at 80 recovery in first pass nanofiltration is safe in continuous mode it was unwittingly confirmed during system malfunction which forced 2 h shutdown just as the module was working at 80 recovery after removing the malfunction and restarting the nf1 no significant change in module operation was observed table s4 in the supplementary materials presents the composition of raw water permeate and retentate the results show good separation between univalent and bivalent ions which indicates the possibility of magnesium hydroxide recovery from the retentate stream with simultaneous salt recovery from the permeate stream the two pass nanofiltration system has shown very high rejection coefficients see table 1 with respect to bivalent ions and relatively low rejection coefficients of univalent ions which is a desired behaviour from the point of view of separating sodium chloride from calcium and magnesium 3 3 single pass electrodialysis the experiments were conducted using two electrodialyzers working in the single pass mode and arranged in a counter current cascade configuration the feed water was fed to the concentrate compartment of the first electrodialyzer ed1 then the ed1 concentrate was fed to the concentrate compartment of the second electrodialyzer ed2 where it was further concentrated simultaneously the feed water was fed to the ed2 diluate compartment and the ed2 diluate was fed to the ed1 diluate compartment where it was further concentrated the feed water was the retentate from the reverse osmosis retentate working on the nanofiltration permeate nf1 recovery 80 nf2 recovery 80 nf2 retentate completely recycled before nf2 the current density in both electrodialyzers was kept constant two pc cell 1000 a modules were used each equipped with 25 pairs of ionsep k a membranes separated with 0 35 mm spacers the volumetric flow rate was 8 dm3 h in the concentrate chamber and 119 dm3 h in the diluate chamber the difference in the flow rates cause the hydraulic pressure difference across the membrane this in turn may cause the bulging of the membrane a physical deformation leading to increased inter membrane distance in the diluate compartment i e less favourable mass transfer conditions in the boundary layer and the partially blocked concentrate compartment to avoid the membrane bulging the concentrate outlet was throttled to ensure equal pressure drop on both sides of the membrane as described in patent application 20 the composition of the obtained concentrates is presented in tables s5 s10 in the supplementary materials the obtained brine had relatively low concentration of bivalent contaminants so4 2 mg2 ca2 which indicates a possibility of reaching higher salt recovery in case of produced brine being use in evaporated salt production and stems from the application of nanofiltration before the reverse osmosis the brine is not sufficiently saline however to be directly fed to the crystallizer and requires further concentration this indicates the necessity of further optimization of electrodialysis in particular the second step of the cascade where the increase in concentration was lower than in the first step of the cascade it may be a result of the application of specific type of membranes the differences in chemical composition of the membrane may cause the differences in ions and water transport affecting the composition of the obtained concentrate it should be noted that the possibility of obtaining the ed concentrate close to saturation was confirmed in the bench scale unit cs 0 asahi glass co ltd with selemion csv and asv membranes and 0 75 mm thin spacers which working in batch mode at constant current density was able to concentrate model nacl solution from 36 5 kg m3 as cl to 176 kg m3 as cl and simultaneously desalinate model nacl solution from 36 5 kg m3 as cl to 23 5 kg m3 as cl 21 the energy consumption during the bench scale studies was 0 24 kwh kg of transported salt 6 mol of water were transported per every mole of chlorides during the pilot studies however it was not possible to use the same selemion csv asv membranes nor it was possible to scale up the intermembrane spacers design to the size required by the used ed units fig 4 presents the voltage drop per membrane pair each electrodialyzer consisted of 25 membrane pairs fig 5 presents the energy consumption in the electrodialysis high current density was applied which resulted in relatively high energy consumption indicating the necessity of further optimization on the other hand if the proposed technology is to be implemented at a site where there is waste heat available further concentration by electrodialysis may not be required instead an efficient thermal method may be cheaper such solution is however beyond the scope of the tests in this pilot plant and strongly depends on the situation in the specific mine 4 benchmarking in order to assess the technology proposed in the zero brine project following case studies have been modelled 1 the feed water from the bolesław śmiały coal mine is pre concentrated with reverse osmosis then subjected to the vapour compression vc which concentrates it to 290 g dm3 as nacl this is the reference zod technology which is currently utilized in the dębieńsko desalination plant according the reference plant staff the energy consumption in this technology is 5 kwh m3 of treated brine in the ro and 44 kwh m3 of distillate in the vc 2 the feed water from the bolesław śmiały coal mine is fed to the ultrafiltration and decarbonization two pass nanofiltration nf1 working at 80 nf2 working at 80 with all of the retentate recycled back to the nf1 then to ro ed unit which concentrates the brine up to ca 111 g l as cl then the ed concentrate is fed to the vc part of the dębieńsko technology the nf1 retentate is used for mg oh 2 recovery using the criem technology described in ref 22 3 the feed water from the bolesław śmiały coal mine is fed to the ultrafiltration and decarbonization two pass nanofiltration nf1 working at 80 nf2 working at 80 with all of the retentate recycled back to the nf1 then to the ro ed unit which concentrates the brine up to ca 111 g l as cl then the ed concentrate is fed to the modern thermal method med of energy consumption of 12 kwh m3 of distillate assuming no waste heat is available at the site the nf1 retentate is used for mg oh 2 recovery using the criem technology 22 4 the feed water from the bolesław śmiały coal mine is fed to the ultrafiltration and decarbonization then to the two pass nanofiltration nf1 recovery 75 nf2 recovery 75 with intermediate gypsum precipitation a cstr crystallizer with hydraulic residence time of 1 2 h which is enough to allow spontaneous precipitation of gypsum down to ca 164 saturation without adding chemicals 23 the nf2 permeate is fed to ro ed unit which concentrates the brine up to ca 111 g l as cl then the ed concentrate is fed to the modern thermal method med of energy consumption of 12 kwh m3 of distillate assuming no waste heat is available at the site the rejection coefficients and energy consumption of each individual unit operations of zero brine technology were based on the data obtained in the pilot studies salt recovery was calculated assuming dębieńsko crystallization technology in which the amount of crystallized salt is limited by the bivalent impurities present the methodology of calculating crystallizer energy consumption amount of recoverable salt and the ionic composition of post crystallization lyes have been presented in ref 17 1 the maximum concentration of bivalent ions in the post crystallization lyes is 8 w w as mgcl2 cacl2 this is the actual limit of the crystallizer in the existing plant 2 the maximum chloride concentration in the post crystallization lyes is 200 g l 3 the solubility product of calcium sulphate is 4 302 10 6 mol2 dm6 value calculated based on the composition of post crystallization lyes from the plant and corresponding to the temperature and ionic strength of the liquid in the existing crystallizer 4 rejection coefficients of a ro membrane used in dębieńsko technology were assumed as follows rcl 99 22 rmg2 99 90 rca2 99 85 rso42 99 72 for the zero brine technology the ionic compositions of the process streams obtained during the plant operation were used 5 the maximum total dissolved salts content tds of the ro concentrate is 60 g l the dębieńsko crystallizer can recover gypsum so this factor was also taken into account magnesium hydroxide recovery was calculated as the amount of recoverable magnesium hydroxide in the nf retentate stream assuming 100 of mg2 ions can be precipitated as mg oh 2 with the addition of sodium hydroxide in the case of dębieńsko it was assumed as 0 since this reference technology does not recover magnesium water recovery was assumed as ratio of mixed ro permeate and thermal method distillate to the inlet brine volume since setting the flow in the pilot plant relied on using pump by passes the energy consumption in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis were calculated using methodology presented in ref 24 however instead of relying upon theoretical rejection coefficients and pressures real values obtained during continuous plant run were put into the equations 4 e n f 1 0 02724 p n

in the concentrate inlet and outlet of i th electrodialyzer respectively vc out i and vc in i are the volumetric flows of the concentrate inlet and outlet of i th electrodialyzer respectively table 2 presents the calculated energy consumption and recovery of raw materials the results suggest that the application of intermediate gypsum precipitation is necessary in order to improve performance in comparison with the existing technology the salt recovery can be increased from 81 to over 92 with simultaneous cut in energy consumption by a third additionally the zero brine technology allows for the recovery of magnesium hydroxide 5 conclusions two pass nanofiltration was shown to be possible at high permeate recovery 80 without the observable scaling very high rejection coefficients with respect two bivalent ions even above 95 and relatively low rejection coefficients of univalent ions were observed in the test two pass nanofiltration system this is a desired behaviour from the point of view of separating sodium chloride from calcium and magnesium the results confirm that from the point of view of circular economy the application of nanofiltration is very desirable it would not be possible to subsequently recover magnesium hydroxide or gypsum without selective removal of bivalent salts from the feed water electrodialysis working on the reverse osmosis retentate can exhibit relatively low energy consumption which makes it a feasible method for decreasing the volume of saline waste water from desalination plants it was not possible to reach the desired goal of producing the concentrated brine directly in the electrodialysis this can be a result of using dense intermembrane spacers commercial 0 35 mm pc cell spacers with thick membranes although the sut has a laboratory scale technology of thinner spacers application of which can generate concentrated brine as confirmed by laboratory tests upscaling the technology met unforeseen technical difficulties which could not be resolved in time for the pilot tests the application of intermediate gypsum precipitation in the two pass nanofiltration is a necessary step in order to achieve salt recovery higher than the reference dębieńsko technology the energy consumption of the proposed zero brine technology is substantially lower 23 33 than the reference dębieńsko technology reaching 11 2 kwh m3 of treated brine it also can increase the recovery of valuable raw materials by increasing the salt recovery and allowing for the recovery of magnesium hydroxide author statement krzysztof mitko

recovery 17 there have been many proposals to improve the performance of dębieńsko with integrated membrane based systems 17 19 the zero brine project is a four year innovation action ia financed by the european commission it aims to close the loop and improve the environmental impact of industrial production by showing that raw materials can be recovered from industrial processes to then be reused in other industries one of the aims of the zero brine project is to demonstrate the circular economy solution in the coal mining industry this includes showing an innovative brine treatment at pilot scale the pilot plant in question demonstrating the zero brine technology developed and tested within the framework of this project was located in bolesław śmiały coal mine in łaziska górne poland a coal mine owned by pgg polska grupa górnicza s a the eu s largest black coal mining company producing annually approx 30 million tons of black coal total eu production 100 million tons the bolesław śmiały coal mine water surpasses the legal limits imposed on industrial waste waters so before the discharge it is mixed with industrial waste water from the energy plant sharing the same site there currently is no further treatment of discharge the technology proposed in the zero brine can mitigate the environmental problems related to the saline discharge the technology has the surplus value of extracting valuable products from the discharge reverse osmosis permeate of high purity which can be utilized in a nearby power plant and inorganic compounds such as magnesium hydroxide and salt which have commercial value the proposed scheme is as follows the feed coal mine water is being pre treated with ultrafiltration and decarbonization and is then subjected to a two pass nanofiltration treatment the nanofiltration unit splits the coal mine water into two streams salt rich permeate and calcium and magnesium rich retentate the retentate can be used in the recovery of magnesium hydroxide a valuable commodity in the refractory materials industry the remaining calcium rich solution can be used as a de icing liquid the nanofiltration permeate is concentrated in a hybrid reverse osmosis electrodialysis system which produces demineralized water of quality close to distilled water highly saline concentrate and the diluate which can be recycled either before the reverse osmosis or before the nanofiltration the highly saline concentrate can then be sold directly or used as a source for salt crystallization the aim of this study was to test the proposed technology in the pilot scale the pilot plant capable of treating 400 l h was designed by the silesian university of technology and built by the polymemtech the system was installed on 23 06 2019 and has been operated during the period of 24 06 2019 to 16 03 2020 to assess the plant performance the results obtained in the zero brine project were compared with the reference technology the desalination plant in czerwionka leszczyny poland formerly known as dębieńsko 2 experimental 2 1 feed water and sample analysis before the plant installation samples of raw coal mine water were

pass nanofiltration each nf pass consisted of two pressure vessels filled with two modules each trisep ts40 membranes were used reverse osmosis two stage electrodialysis two pc cell 1000a electrodialyzers connected in a cascade the general layout of the plant and sampling points can be seen in fig 1 the photos of the installed plant can be seen in fig 2 the retentate from the second pass of nanofiltration nf2 can either be recycled before the first pass of nanofiltration nf1 or discarded the diluate from the second stage of electrodialysis can be recycled either before the reverse osmosis ro or before the nf1 during the plant run the concentration of cl ca2 mg2 so4 2 na was determined in the process streams using the thermodionex ics 500 ion chromatograph equipped with a cs 16 as 19 columns 3 results 3 1 feed water analysis the results of semi quantitative analysis of bolesław śmiały water are presented in table s1 in the supplementary materials the only uncommon element found in the water is erbium however its concentration is very low ca 0 3 mg dm3 the presence of erbium may be a result of interference during the analysis the water has a low content of silica ca 1 4 mg dm3 as elemental si which was manageable in the pilot plant by a pretreatment system the amount of manganese is very low ca 0 1 mg dm3 and no iron has been detected which was a positive sign from the point of view of scaling risk in the pilot plant on the other hand there is strontium ca 1 6 mg dm3 which carries some scaling risk the concentration of major ionic compounds of water in question is presented in table s2 in the supplementary materials based on the results the relative gypsum saturation and the langelier saturation index lsi have been calculated assuming temperature of 25 c see table s3 in the supplementary materials high values of bicarbonate concentration may be a result of analytical errors in major components determination as bicarbonate is calculated based on ionic balance of solution the results show that bolesław śmiały water has a tds of ca 23 24 g dm3 and is saturated with calcium carbonate 3 2 two pass nanofiltration recovery in nanofiltration is limited by the risk of sparingly soluble salts crystallization in the retentate if that happens it would result in clogging the membrane modules and their malfunction in order to assess the maximum permissible recovery the retentate has been gradually chocked in the first pass nanofiltration nf1 and the hydraulic pressure drop i e the difference between retentate and feed has been monitored the sudden increase in this value would indicate blocking of the module by the deposits the recovery in the second pass nanofiltration nf2 was 80 the recovery of 60 70 and 80 has been studied in the first pass more endangered by the sparingly soluble salts crystallization no significant change in hydraulic pressure drop has been observed for the tested recovery range fig 3 work at higher recovery would be too risky because of existing supersaturation of calcium sulphate in the retentate at 80 recovery the retentate was already supersaturated but because of slow crystallization kinetics it only precipitated in the collected retentate samples after few hours the hydraulic residence time in nf module is lower than the time required for observing the macroscopic crystallization meaning it can be concluded that work at 80 recovery in first pass nanofiltration is safe in continuous mode it was unwittingly confirmed during system malfunction which forced 2 h shutdown just as the module was working at 80 recovery after removing the malfunction and restarting the nf1 no significant change in module operation was observed table s4 in the supplementary materials presents the composition of raw water permeate and retentate the results show good separation between univalent and bivalent ions which indicates the possibility of magnesium hydroxide recovery from the retentate stream with simultaneous salt recovery from the permeate stream the two pass nanofiltration system has shown very high rejection coefficients see table 1 with respect to bivalent ions and relatively low rejection coefficients of univalent ions which is a desired behaviour from the point of view of separating sodium chloride from calcium and magnesium 3 3 single pass electrodialysis the experiments were conducted using two electrodialyzers working in the single pass mode and arranged in a counter current cascade configuration the feed water was fed to the concentrate compartment of the first electrodialyzer ed1 then the ed1 concentrate was fed to the concentrate compartment of the second electrodialyzer ed2 where it was further concentrated simultaneously the feed water was fed to the ed2 diluate compartment and the ed2 diluate was fed to the ed1 diluate compartment where it was further concentrated the feed water was the retentate from the reverse osmosis retentate working on the nanofiltration permeate nf1 recovery 80 nf2 recovery 80 nf2 retentate completely recycled before nf2 the current density in both electrodialyzers was kept constant two pc cell 1000 a modules were used each equipped with 25 pairs of ionsep k a membranes separated with 0 35 mm spacers the volumetric flow rate was 8 dm3 h in the concentrate chamber and 119 dm3 h in the diluate chamber the difference in the flow rates cause the hydraulic pressure difference across the membrane this in turn may cause the bulging of the membrane a physical deformation leading to increased inter membrane distance in the diluate compartment i e less favourable mass transfer conditions in the boundary layer and the partially blocked concentrate compartment to avoid the membrane bulging the concentrate outlet was throttled to ensure equal pressure drop on both sides of the membrane as described in patent application 20 the composition of the obtained concentrates is presented in tables s5 s10 in the supplementary materials the obtained brine had relatively low concentration of bivalent contaminants so4 2 mg2 ca2 which indicates a possibility of reaching higher salt recovery in case of produced brine being use in evaporated salt production and stems from the application of nanofiltration before the reverse osmosis the brine is not sufficiently saline however to be directly fed to the crystallizer and requires further concentration this indicates the necessity of further optimization of electrodialysis in particular the second step of the cascade where the increase in concentration was lower than in the first step of the cascade it may be a result of the application of specific type of membranes the differences in chemical composition of the membrane may cause the differences in ions and water transport affecting the composition of the obtained concentrate it should be noted that the possibility of obtaining the ed concentrate close to saturation was confirmed in the bench scale unit cs 0 asahi glass co ltd with selemion csv and asv membranes and 0 75 mm thin spacers which working in batch mode at constant current density was able to concentrate model nacl solution from 36 5 kg m3 as cl to 176 kg m3 as cl and simultaneously desalinate model nacl solution from 36 5 kg m3 as cl to 23 5 kg m3 as cl 21 the energy consumption during the bench scale studies was 0 24 kwh kg of transported salt 6 mol of water were transported per every mole of chlorides during the pilot studies however it was not possible to use the same selemion csv asv membranes nor it was possible to scale up the intermembrane spacers design to the size required by the used ed units fig 4 presents the voltage drop per membrane pair each electrodialyzer consisted of 25 membrane pairs fig 5 presents the energy consumption in the electrodialysis high current density was applied which resulted in relatively high energy consumption indicating the necessity of further optimization on the other hand if the proposed technology is to be implemented at a site where there is waste heat available further concentration by electrodialysis may not be required instead an efficient thermal method may be cheaper such solution is however beyond the scope of the tests in this pilot plant and strongly depends on the situation in the specific mine 4 benchmarking in order to assess the technology proposed in the zero brine project following case studies have been modelled 1 the feed water from the bolesław śmiały coal mine is pre concentrated with reverse osmosis then subjected to the vapour compression vc which concentrates it to 290 g dm3 as nacl this is the reference zod technology which is currently utilized in the dębieńsko desalination plant according the reference plant staff the energy consumption in this technology is 5 kwh m3 of treated brine in the ro and 44 kwh m3 of distillate in the vc 2 the feed water from the bolesław śmiały coal mine is fed to the ultrafiltration and decarbonization two pass nanofiltration nf1 working at 80 nf2 working at 80 with all of the retentate recycled back to the nf1 then to ro ed unit which concentrates the brine up to ca 111 g l as cl then the ed concentrate is fed to the vc part of the dębieńsko technology the nf1 retentate is used for mg oh 2 recovery using the criem technology described in ref 22 3 the feed water from the bolesław śmiały coal mine is fed to the ultrafiltration and decarbonization two pass nanofiltration nf1 working at 80 nf2 working at 80 with all of the retentate recycled back to the nf1 then to the ro ed unit which concentrates the brine up to ca 111 g l as cl then the ed concentrate is fed to the modern thermal method med of energy consumption of 12 kwh m3 of distillate assuming no waste heat is available at the site the nf1 retentate is used for mg oh 2 recovery using the criem technology 22 4 the feed water from the bolesław śmiały coal mine is fed to the ultrafiltration and decarbonization then to the two pass nanofiltration nf1 recovery 75 nf2 recovery 75 with intermediate gypsum precipitation a cstr crystallizer with hydraulic residence time of 1 2 h which is enough to allow spontaneous precipitation of gypsum down to ca 164 saturation without adding chemicals 23 the nf2 permeate is fed to ro ed unit which concentrates the brine up to ca 111 g l as cl then the ed concentrate is fed to the modern thermal method med of energy consumption of 12 kwh m3 of distillate assuming no waste heat is available at the site the rejection coefficients and energy consumption of each individual unit operations of zero brine technology were based on the data obtained in the pilot studies salt recovery was calculated assuming dębieńsko crystallization technology in which the amount of crystallized salt is limited by the bivalent impurities present the methodology of calculating crystallizer energy consumption amount of recoverable salt and the ionic composition of post crystallization lyes have been presented in ref 17 1 the maximum concentration of bivalent ions in the post crystallization lyes is 8 w w as mgcl2 cacl2 this is the actual limit of the crystallizer in the existing plant 2 the maximum chloride concentration in the post crystallization lyes is 200 g l 3 the solubility product of calcium sulphate is 4 302 10 6 mol2 dm6 value calculated based on the composition of post crystallization lyes from the plant and corresponding to the temperature and ionic strength of the liquid in the existing crystallizer 4 rejection coefficients of a ro membrane used in dębieńsko technology were assumed as follows rcl 99 22 rmg2 99 90 rca2 99 85 rso42 99 72 for the zero brine technology the ionic compositions of the process streams obtained during the plant operation were used 5 the maximum total dissolved salts content tds of the ro concentrate is 60 g l the dębieńsko crystallizer can recover gypsum so this factor was also taken into account magnesium hydroxide recovery was calculated as the amount of recoverable magnesium hydroxide in the nf retentate stream assuming 100 of mg2 ions can be precipitated as mg oh 2 with the addition of sodium hydroxide in the case of dębieńsko it was assumed as 0 since this reference technology does not recover magnesium water recovery was assumed as ratio of mixed ro permeate and thermal method distillate to the inlet brine volume since setting the flow in the pilot plant relied on using pump by passes the energy consumption in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis were calculated using methodology presented in ref 24 however instead of relying upon theoretical rejection coefficients and pressures real values obtained during continuous plant run were put into the equations 4 e n f 1 0 02724 p n

in the concentrate inlet and outlet of i th electrodialyzer respectively vc out i and vc in i are the volumetric flows of the concentrate inlet and outlet of i th electrodialyzer respectively table 2 presents the calculated energy consumption and recovery of raw materials the results suggest that the application of intermediate gypsum precipitation is necessary in order to improve performance in comparison with the existing technology the salt recovery can be increased from 81 to over 92 with simultaneous cut in energy consumption by a third additionally the zero brine technology allows for the recovery of magnesium hydroxide 5 conclusions two pass nanofiltration was shown to be possible at high permeate recovery 80 without the observable scaling very high rejection coefficients with respect two bivalent ions even above 95 and relatively low rejection coefficients of univalent ions were observed in the test two pass nanofiltration system this is a desired behaviour from the point of view of separating sodium chloride from calcium and magnesium the results confirm that from the point of view of circular economy the application of nanofiltration is very desirable it would not be possible to subsequently recover magnesium hydroxide or gypsum without selective removal of bivalent salts from the feed water electrodialysis working on the reverse osmosis retentate can exhibit relatively low energy consumption which makes it a feasible method for decreasing the volume of saline waste water from desalination plants it was not possible to reach the desired goal of producing the concentrated brine directly in the electrodialysis this can be a result of using dense intermembrane spacers commercial 0 35 mm pc cell spacers with thick membranes although the sut has a laboratory scale technology of thinner spacers application of which can generate concentrated brine as confirmed by laboratory tests upscaling the technology met unforeseen technical difficulties which could not be resolved in time for the pilot tests the application of intermediate gypsum precipitation in the two pass nanofiltration is a necessary step in order to achieve salt recovery higher than the reference dębieńsko technology the energy consumption of the proposed zero brine technology is substantially lower 23 33 than the reference dębieńsko technology reaching 11 2 kwh m3 of treated brine it also can increase the recovery of valuable raw materials by increasing the salt recovery and allowing for the recovery of magnesium hydroxide author statement krzysztof mitko

8783,citrus wastewater is a sugar rich waste stream suitable for the recovery of energy of material from its treatment in this study fermentation of citrus wastewater was carried out to assess the optimal conditions to maximize the bioconversion of the organic substrate into acetate unbalanced nutrient c n p 200 0 1 0 1 enabled the highest acetate production the presence of the particulate organic fraction enabled to obtain a higher acetate concentration regardless the initial cod concentration initial ph values higher than 5 did not cause substantial differences on the maximum bioconversion of cod into acetate whereas ph lower than 5 hindered the hydrolysis process lastly the bioconversion rate of the organic substrate into acetate decreased from a maximum of 23 to a minimum of 8 related to the initial cod the achieved results demonstrated that the characteristics of citrus wastewater enable its valorisation without the need to apply energy consuming processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords acetate anaerobic process bioconversion citrus wastewater fermentation 1 introduction in the last decades environmental legislations promoted resources recovery from waste and wastewater streams 1 the will to apply the principles of the circular economy model in solid and liquid wastes management practices has addressed researchers to employ innovative solutions aimed at enhancing waste streams valorisation providing the simultaneous minimization of waste disposal and generation of value added products 2 the volatile fatty acids vfa are short chain organic compounds constituted by a number of carbon atoms of six or fewer 3 which are produced during acidogenesis when organic matter is degraded under anaerobic conditions 4 more precisely three processes are involved in vfa production hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis during hydrolysis complex organic polymers are broken down into simpler organic monomers which are subsequently fermented into acetic propionic and butyric acids during acidogenesis 5 finally during acetogenesis those products are converted into acetate vfa are valuable substrates that have a wide range of applications like biogas production in anaerobic digestion process in the food and pharmaceutical industries 3 carbon source for nitrogen and phosphorous removal in wastewater treatment plants or the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates pha for the production of bio based plastics 6 7 in all the above processes the yield and the quality of the final products i e biogas or pha are affected by the amount and composition of vfa deriving from the fermentation process 2 8 therefore the maximization of vfa production is often critical for the performances of the downstream processes according to the literature during anaerobic fermentation many factors might affect vfa production 6 9 among these environmental factors like ph and temperature as well as operating parameter such as hydraulic retention time hrt and organic loading rate olr have significant effects on the yield of vfa produced the research findings suggest that the optimal values of the operating parameters for vfa maximization are highly dependent on the carbon source used it seems that the proper operating parameters should be referred to the specific wastewater to be processed besides the operating parameters the production of vfa is substantially affected by the type of the waste wastewater 10 12 indeed researchers are still debating about which type of waste wastewater is more suitable for vfa production a suitable waste wastewater should be characterized by high content of organic substrates i e proteins carbohydrates fats etc low nitrogen content absence of toxic and recalcitrant compounds and high amount and availability of the waste itself 2 13 several solid and liquid wastes have been proposed in the literature for vfa production i e paper mill effluents cheese whey kitchen waste waste activated sludge etc 2 11 14 among these wastewater generated from agro based production are potentially considered amongst the most suitable to maximize vfa production because of the high content of organic matter chemical oxygen demand cod 4000 mg l and the low content of nitrogen that could inhibit the fermentation process 15 citrus wastewater are organic rich wastewater streams generated from citrus fruits processing including washing of fruits and machineries extraction of juice and essential oils as well as peel drying and cooling 16 citrus wastewaters are characterized by high content of organic matter suspended solids essential oils and generally low ph 3 as well as unbalanced nutrients due to the lack in nitrogen and phosphorous 17 the cod of citrus wastewater is generally high ranging between 1000 mg l and 10 000 mg l depending on the type of citrus fruit processed 18 moreover the cod is characterized by a very high biodegradability being the readily biodegradable fraction close to 70 19 based on the above characteristics citrus wastewater is potentially suitable for vfa production most of the studies referred to citrus waste fermentation indicated that the presence of some potential toxic substances such as limonene and other essential oils present in the peels of citrus fruits could result in the inhibition of fermentation process 20 21 many of these substances are usually recovered before juice extraction since their great economic value and accordingly their content in the wastewater deriving from juice processing is extremely low for this reason recovery of vfa from wastewater could be more convenient due to the lower amount of inhibiting substances however as authors are aware few studies dealing with vfa production from citrus wastewater and in general aimed at its valorisation have been reported in the technical literature so far 22 23 in this light the aim of the present study was to optimize vfa production from the fermentation of citrus wastewater more precisely this study investigated the role of some operating parameters like the nutrients carbon to nitrogen to phosphorous c n p ratio ph and the olr on the vfa production from the fermentation of a citrus processing wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 citrus wastewater characterization citrus wastewater samples were collected from a citrus processing industry located in palermo agrumaria corleone s p a citrus wastewater was generated from tangerines processing and were characterized in terms of ph electrical conductivity total suspended solids tss content total chemical oxygen demand tcod soluble chemical oxygen demand scod and vfa as acetate concentrations the main features of the citrus wastewater are summarized in table 1 2 2 experimental set up experiments were carried out in 1 l glass bottle reactors continuously mixed by a magnetic stirrer the filling ratio with wastewater was close to 95 to reduce the headspace volume and thus limiting the amount of oxygen that could dissolve in the liquid phase each reactor was subsequently hermetically sealed using a specific cap and a silicone gasket to avoid the air draw from the outside four trials were performed during the experimental campaign each having a duration of 21 days the reactors were fed in batch static mode meaning that neither feeding nor discharging excepting the samples for analyses were performed during the entire trials duration in each trial only one operating parameter was changed whereas the others were maintained constant the operating parameter that provided the highest acetate production in the previous trial was maintained during all the following trials in trial 1 the effect of carbon as tcod to nitrogen and phosphorous ratio c n p was evaluated to this aim three different batch reactors were started up with a different c n p ratio equal to 200 0 1 0 1 a1 200 5 1 a2 and 200 10 2 a3 more precisely in a1 no nitrogen neither phosphorous were added in the reactor thus maintaining the original c n p ratio of the raw citrus wastewater whereas in a2 and a3 ammonium chloride and potassium orthophosphate were added to obtain the desired c n p ratios in each reactor the raw citrus wastewater no clarification was diluted with tap water to obtain an initial tcod concentration of 4000 mg l and the ph was subsequently adjusted to neutral 7 by adding sodium hydroxide in trial 2 the effect of the particulate organic matter was studied in this case the citrus wastewater was subjected to static settling for 2 h and the supernatant was separated from the settled solids the total suspended solids concentration in the supernatant was negligible 5 mg l thus it was considered that all the particulate substances were removed therefore two reactors were started the first one with the supernatant of the citrus wastewater subjected to static settling 2 h b1 whereas the second one with the raw citrus wastewater thus including the settleable solids content b2 in both cases the citrus wastewater either clarified or not was diluted with tap water to obtain the same tcod concentration of the trial 1 4000 mg l and similarly ph was adjusted to neutral concerning the c n p ratio it was set equal to a1 no nitrogen and phosphorous supply because it resulted the best in terms of acetate production in the previous trial as better outlined in the following section 3 in trial 3 the effect of the initial ph was investigated based on the results obtained in the previous trials the citrus wastewater not clarified with a c n p ratio equal to 200 0 1 0 1 and a tcod of 4000 mg l after dilution was added in four reactors c1 c2 c3 and c4 afterwards the ph was adjusted to 7 in c1 6 in c2 5 in c3 and 4 in c4 by adding sodium hydroxide in trial 4 the effect of the initial tcod concentration was assessed four batch reactors were filled with not clarified citrus wastewater diluted with tap water according to different dilution factors in order to obtain an initial tcod concentration of 4000 mg l d1 8000 mg l d2 16 000 mg l d3 and 32 000 mg l d4 according to the best results achieved in trial 3 the ph was adjusted to 7 during trial 1 the reactors were operated at room temperature 15 2 c whereas in the other trials the reactors were maintained at controlled temperature 20 0 1 c the ph was daily measured in all the trials but was not controlled during the experiment excepting at day zero a small volume 2 ml was sampled daily from each reactor in all the trials in order to measure the vfa as acetate concentration no bacterial inoculum was added in the different trials since fermentative microorganisms were already present in the initial wastewater in fig 1 a summary of the trials operating conditions is reported 2 3 analytical methods all the physical chemical analyses including tss scod tcod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp were performed according to standard methods 24 the ph was measured using a ph meter wtw sentix 9xx connected to a wtw 3430 multi meter naoh was used in order to adjust the ph at the desired value samples from each reactor were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane before measuring the acetate concentration by means of an ion chromatograph dionex dx 120 a reference curve was constructed by using a pure standard of acetate in the range of 1 10 000 mg l for further details the reader is referred to the literature 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of c n p ratio trial 1 in trial 1 the effect of different c n p ratios on the acetate production was studied fig 2 the initial acetate concentration in the citrus wastewater was about 20 mg l as depicted in fig 2a the acetate concentration slightly decreased after the first day in all the reactors but it significantly increased on day 2 more precisely the acetate concentration raised from 1 90 mg l to 601 mg l 576 mg l and 520 mg l in a1 a2 and a3 respectively thus the maximum acetate concentration was achieved in the reactor operating under unbalanced nutrient condition c n p 200 0 1 0 1 although the difference in the acetate production was marginal 10 15 compared to the other batch reactors similar results were found in the literature 26 in which the authors observed that nitrogen and phosphorus affected the acetate production in the acidogenic reactor in particular boonsawang and co authors 26 observed that the maximum production of acetate was obtained at cod n p of 100 1 1 0 5 treating biodiesel wastewater whereas fu and co authors found that a c n ratio of 30 maximized the acetate production from textile wastewater 27 similar results were also reported by liu et al 28 which observed that the maximum yield production of vfa was achieved under the highest c n ratio investigated 50 1 also huang and co authors in a recent study observed that the yield of vfa production increased with c n and the amount of acetate was proportional to the carbohydrate content of the waste subjected to fermentation 29 at the same time ph decreased in all the reactors from 7 to 5 4 5 9 and 6 3 in a1 a2 and a3 respectively fig 2b indicating that the ph decrease was proportional to the acetate production after day 2 the acetate concentrations decreased in all the reactors although with different trends indeed in a1 the acetate concentration decreased to a minimum value of 270 mg l on the 7th day whereas in a2 and a3 the acetate almost disappeared 15 mg l during this phase the ph increased in all the reactors reaching values of 6 80 7 45 and 7 50 in a1 a2 and a3 respectively when the acetate concentration was minimum atasoy et al 6 reported that under no ph control the acetate production is characterized by significant variation because of the development of different bacterial strains during the fermentation process more recently another study demonstrated that under uncontrolled ph the acetate consumption could be observed because its production and degradation by methanogens could occur simultaneously 30 however operating at high c n might minimize this effect because it reduces the growth rate of methanogens 31 32 after this transition period the acetate concentration started to increase again in a1 although with a lower rate compared to the previous one the maximum acetate concentration was reached on the 15th day 723 mg l and it remained almost stable at this value for about 5 days after which it slightly decreased reaching a value of approximately 600 mg l at the end of the observed period in this phase the acetate accounted for approximately 50 of the scod and 40 of the tcod accordingly ph decreased in this period remaining stably close to 6 until the end of the trial in contrast to what observed in a1 no further acetate production was observed in a2 and a3 after that the minimum value was reached and ph remained close to neutral in both the reactors the decrease of acetate concentration observed after the 2nd day was directly proportional to the c n p ratio indeed in the literature it is widely reported as a condition of nutrients balance is favourable to the synthesis process of bacteria that might led to the consumption of the acetate produced during fermentation 33 therefore in a2 and a3 the higher availability of nutrients likely favoured the growth of bacteria and consequently the higher consumption of the acetate previously produced 30 nevertheless even in a1 the acetate concentration decreased thereby suggesting that the occurrence of bacterial growth phenomena even if minimal it is worth to observe that after the 2nd day the ph increased in all the reactors suggesting the occurrence of hydrolysis reactions involving the particulate organic fraction in the citrus wastewater according to literature 34 indeed the recovery of the acetate production in a1 was due to the fermentation of the hydrolysed products previously produced because the hydrolysis process involves complex reactions the production rate of the soluble organic molecules ready to be fermented is low 2 this certainly limited the rate of acetate production that was lower compared with that observed until day 2 when the organic matter available for the fermentation process was already in the soluble form in a2 and a3 the organic matter deriving from the hydrolysis of the particulate one was likely simultaneously used by bacteria for growth purpose thus reducing its availability for the fermentation reactions in a1 the consumption of the acetate by bacteria was minimized because of the low c n p thereby favouring the fermentation reactions over new biomass synthesis based on the above results unbalanced nutrient condition is preferable for the acetate production from citrus wastewater fermentation indeed it allowed achieving a higher bioconversion of both the soluble and particulate cod into acetate while preventing the use of the organic matter by bacteria for growth the above results are consistent with the current literature results highlighting that unbalanced nutrient condition high c n are favourable not only to promote the vfas production but also to suppress the consumption of vfas 6 29 31 3 2 effect of settleable solids removal trial 2 in trial 2 two batch reactors with raw b1 and clarified b2 citrus wastewater were started fig 3 shows the trend profiles of the acetate concentration fig 3a and ph fig 3b during the experiment the trend of the acetate concentrations and ph in b1 were very similar with those observed in a1 because the operating conditions were basically the same this confirmed the repeatability and reproducibility of the achieved results in more detail as reported in fig 3a a first peak in the acetate concentration was observed on the 2nd day of operation according with that observed in trial 1 however in this case the concentration of the acetate was approximately 50 higher 900 mg l vs 600 mg l likely due to the higher temperature in b1 20 c vs 16 c hereafter the decrease of the acetate concentration and its further increase due to hydrolysis of the particulate substrate nearly followed that observed in a1 the trend of the acetate concentration in b2 rapidly increased at the beginning of the experiment reaching the maximum value of 419 mg l on day 2 in the three following days the acetate concentration slightly decreased by approximately 13 357 mg l on the 5th day while remaining almost constant until the end of the observed period although the initial tcod concentration was the same in b1 and b2 the highest value of acetate concentration was observed in b1 the reason for this result could be twofold first in b2 bacteria were present in a lower amount in the reactor because being mainly in particulate form were removed during the sample pre treatment thus reducing the efficiency of the acidification process in this way the solids removal caused a decrease of the indigenous biomass responsible of fermentation and as a result the reduction of acetate production this results is consistent with recent studies in which the authors reported that a no acclimated inoculum could led to a lower yield of vfa production 32 35 second it could be possible that the hydrolysis of the particulate organic matter occurred also in the early stage of the experiment in b1 leading to a higher availability of soluble products to be fermented 36 in this light literature results reported that low availability of acetate gives a competitive advantage to methanogens bacteria given their lower growth rate compared to that of acidifying bacteria 31 therefore if the acidogenesis process is slow simultaneous acetate consumption by methanogens could occur moreover it is worth noting that the decrease of the acetate concentration in the long term was lower in b2 65 in b1 vs 13 in b2 thereby indicating that the removal of the particulate matter could beneficial in preventing the acetate deterioration this result confirmed that inhibition of methanogens bacteria or their removal as in this case could be an effective strategy to suppress the acetate consumption 31 the results obtained in trial 2 highlighted the role of the particulate organic matter in acetate production by the fermentation process indeed on the one hand the presence of the particulate organic fraction enabled to obtain a higher acetate concentration independently of the initial cod concentration but on the other hand it was likely responsible for the acetate decrease in the long term based on the above results a possible operating strategy could be the separation of the particulate matter after the achievement of the first peak of the acetate concentration although a similar result in terms of the acetate production yield was achievable after approximately 15 days this strategy would require a higher storage capacity for the fermenting reactors hence higher investment costs 3 3 effect of the initial ph trial 3 in trial 3 the effect of the initial ph value was evaluated fig 4 depicts the trends of the acetate concentration fig 4a and ph fig 4b during the trial 3 in this trial the reactor c1 was not started because the operating conditions were the same of b1 and reproducibility of the test was previously demonstrated therefore the data achieved in the previous trial referred to the reactor b1 were considered as the same of c1 in trial 3 a similar behaviour was observed in c1 c2 and c3 in terms of acetate production during the entire experiment more precisely the first peak was noted after 2 days in all reactors the maximum acetate concentration was very similar in the above cited reactors 800 900 mg l although showing a slighter decrease with lower ph values confirming that low ph likely hindered fermentation reactions 37 in contrast the minimum value of ph measured on day 2 was different in c1 c2 and c3 fig 4b indeed the lowest ph values were measured in c3 3 68 and c2 3 80 whereas it was higher in c1 5 4 hereafter ph increased in all the reactors although in c2 and c3 it was constantly lower than c1 this result likely affected the hydrolysis processes in c2 and c3 and consequently the recovery of the acetate production after the 10th day was lower compared to c1 in particular the maximum concentrations achieved in c2 and c3 were approximately 50 410 mg l vs 790 mg l and 70 260 mg l vs 790 mg l lower compared to that of c1 this result indicated that low ph are not favourable to the hydrolysis process thereby confirming what reported in the literature 27 38 in contrast the trend of acetate production in c4 was completely different with those above discussed indeed the acetate concentration increased very slowly at the beginning of the experiment reaching a maximum value close to 400 mg l on day 4 subsequently this concentration remained almost constant for about 7 days while showing a slow decrease afterwards almost halving at the end of the experiment in contrast with the other reactors the recovery of the acetate production due to hydrolysis of the particulate organic matter was not observed in c4 this result confirmed that low ph values are not favourable for the hydrolysis process and even at ph lower than 4 this was completely inhibited 37 38 another difference was observed in terms of acetate decrease after the first peak indeed while in c1 c2 and c3 the acetate concentration decreased proportionally to the ph decrease in reactor c4 instead the decrease of the acetate concentration was smaller in terms of absolute value compared with the other reactors 45 and it showed a slow decrease in time according to what previously discussed the aforementioned results are in good agreement with previous literature results revealing that neutral or alkaline conditions can potentially accelerate the solubilization of organic particles whereas acidic conditions can inhibit the process 39 based on the above results it can be stated that the maximum production of acetate on the soluble cod first peak was comparable in c1 c2 and c3 whereas in c4 it was significantly lower these results suggested that initial ph values higher than 5 did not cause substantial differences referring to the maximum bioconversion of cod into acetate whereas ph lower than 5 caused a slowdown of the start up of fermentation reactions moreover the acetate deterioration increased with the ph decrease in the range of 5 7 whereas at lower ph it was shifted in time and was lower in percentage terms lastly the hydrolysis process was hindered with the ph decrease while it completely stopped at ph lower than 5 as reported in the literature ph of 7 was found the most suitable for hydrolysis and acidogenesis of kitchen waste leading to the highest vfas concentrations in comparison with other ph values 40 the above results are consistent with previous literature in which it was demonstrated that under uncontrolled ph conditions the acetate production is variable during the fermentation process and the highest acetate production was achieved at ph close to 7 30 moreover these results also agreed with the previous finding that the neutral conditions could improve the hydrolysis efficiency of organic substrates 41 3 4 effect of the initial cod concentration trial 4 the effect of different initial cod concentrations was evaluated in trial 4 fig 5 depicts the trend profiles of the acetate concentration fig 5a and ph fig 5b as well as the relationships between the cod with the maximum acetate production and the maximum acetate bioconversion rate fig 5c for the same reason explained in trial 3 the data referred to the reactor d1 are the same of b1 trial 2 as reported in fig 5a the trends of the acetate production were similar in d1 d2 and d3 whereas it was slightly different in d4 especially in the second phase of the experiment more in detail as observed in the previous trials a first peak in the acetate production from the scod was observed in the very first days after the start up of the experiment in particular the maximum acetate production was observed in d4 2850 mg l followed by d3 1403 mg l d2 1195 mg l and lastly d1 901 2 mg l thereby highlighting a certain relationship with the initial tcod concentration moreover it was noted that the maximum acetate production occurred earlier with the increase of the initial tcod concentration indeed in d3 and d4 the maximum acetate concentration was observed after one day from the beginning of the experiment whereas in d1 and d2 after two days hereafter as also observed during the previous trials in all the reactors the acetate concentration slightly decreased referring to the ph trend fig 5b the drop of ph occurring during the early stage of the experiment was proportional to the initial cod concentration therefore the minimum ph values were observed in d4 3 81 and d3 4 01 whereas in d2 and d1 it was higher and close to 5 and 5 4 in d2 and d1 respectively according to what observed in trial 3 the decrease of the acetate concentration was smaller at low ph therefore it could be stated that the smaller rates of the acetate decrease observed in d4 and d3 were due to the lower ph values hereafter the acetate concentration increased in all the reactors due to hydrolysis of particulate cod in this case the acetate production was not proportional to the initial tcod indeed compared to the minimum value in each reactor the acetate concentration increased by approximately 20 in d4 45 in d3 and about 200 in d2 and d1 even in this case the reason of this result could be due to the lower ph values in d3 close to 4 and d4 that somehow hindered the hydrolysis processes the maximum acetate concentration obtained in each reactor was also related to the initial tcod concentration as shown in fig 5c the maximum acetate production did not increase proportionally to the initial tcod concentration and the relationship was asymptotic similarly the maximum bioconversion rate of the tcod to acetate decreased with the initial cod concentration this meant that the increase of the initial cod concentration is not associated to a higher bioconversion rate of the organic substrate to acetate the above results were consistent with previous literature and in particular with the results reported by kaushalya et al 42 in more detail the authors referred that an increase in vfa production was observed as the organic loading rate increased although the increment was not proportional at each step in another study the authors observed that the acetate production increased with olr although the conversion yield of cod to acetate decreased proportionally with the olr 43 according to the authors findings the higher is the cod concentration the higher is the reduction in the kinetic of vfa production consequently proper cod concentration should be carefully ensured to enable maximization of acetate production as previously discussed this result is likely due to an excessive decrease of the ph observed in those reactors with the higher initial tcod concentration it is reasonable to state that the limiting process was the hydrolysis of the particulate cod due to the low ph that likely reduced the enzymatic ability to hydrolyse the organic substrate indeed cheah and co authors 34 demonstrated that at high cod concentration vfa production was not inhibited if ph was controlled at approximately 6 therefore in this study the simultaneous high cod concentration and the uncontrolled ph during fermentation led to the gradual decrease in vfa production because of acidogenic bacteria inhibition due to ph in this respect a control of the ph during the fermentation process could be beneficial to foster the establishment of the proper conditions for hydrolysis the above results are consistent with the literature indeed vfa concentration produced from different types of wastewater rarely increased with the initial cod concentration whilst it was found that the maximum of vfa production was achievable only within a specific range dependent on the wastewater and other operating conditions 2 6 3 5 general considerations for practical implementations the results obtained in the above discussed trials indicated that environmental and operating conditions could significantly affect the acetate production from the fermentation of citrus wastewater the unbalance of nutrients typical for citrus wastewaters is beneficial for maximizing the acetate production certainly the unbalance of nutrients could cause severe issues for the treatment of such wastewater thus the dosage of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous should be performed only after the fermentation process regarding the pre treatment through clarification it was observed that this would reduce the maximum acetate production but at the same time it might prevent the acetate decrease in the long term moreover the removal of the particulate matter hindered the chance to recover acetate from the fermentation of the particulate organic fraction therefore a possible and advisable operating strategy could be the separation of the soluble and particulate fractions after some operating days as suggested by conca et al 44 in this way the soluble fraction could be immediately used or stored without any risks of acetate deterioration in contrast the particulate fraction could be left to ferment although this would imply a higher volume of the fermenter reactor at the end of this phase the fermented wastewater should be filtered to separate the citrus wastewater enriched in acetate from the residual particulate fraction regarding the ph it was observed that the maximum acetate production on the soluble fraction of the cod was independent of ph in a range of 5 7 based on the achieved results it would be convenient to carry out the first stage of the fermentation at low ph 5 because the raw citrus wastewaters have ph close to 3 and this would require a low amount of buffer reagents to adjust the ph however to favour the hydrolysis of the particulate fraction ph should be later adjusted to neutral values the initial tcod concentration affected the maximum acetate production although the bioconversion rate significantly decreased at high cod however from an operating point of view the management of the initial tcod concentration is not easy to perform because it depends on the production processes and on the kind of fruits that change periodically and unpredictable the adjustment of the initial tcod concentration is also a crucial step prior to perform the biological treatment of citrus wastewater in order to avoid an overload of the biological system practically this is commonly obtained by mixing different streams having different cod values but obviously this would imply a high storage capacity within the production site the same practise could be implemented with the aim to maximize the cod bioconversion to acetate referring to the acetate production after hydrolysis it was observed that the lower production achieved in the reactors operating with higher cod was likely due to the low ph indeed as observed in trial 3 at ph lower than 4 the hydrolysis of the particulate matter was limited thus the ph adjustment could prevent the slowdown or shutdown of the hydrolysis process thereby making available also the acetate fraction achievable from the particulate cod based on what discussed so far a possible process scheme could involve the following steps adjustment of the initial cod concentration to a value close to 4000 5000 mg l initial ph adjustment to 5 and neither clarification or nutrients dosage nitrogen and or phosphorous solid liquid separation after approximately 48 h with the liquid fraction ready to be used or stored dosage of alkaline reagents ph to 7 in the fermenter reactor with the particulate matter a conceptual scheme based on the above considerations is reported in fig 6 4 conclusions in this study the effects of some operating parameters on the production of acetate from citrus wastewater were evaluated the production of acetate was significantly affected by all the investigated parameters in particular the nutrients unbalance and the presence of the particulate fraction were found to be beneficial for maximizing the acetate production moreover initial low ph close to 5 are preferable to obtain high acetate production in the short term while avoiding excessive operating costs for ph adjustment furthermore ph close to neutral should be ensured in the long term to enable the hydrolysis of the particulate organic fraction the clarification of the citrus wastewater prior to fermentation prevented the decrease of the acetate concentration in the long term although reducing the maximum acetate production lastly the bioconversion rate from cod to acetate significantly decreased at high cod thus suggesting the advisability to operate at low initial tcod concentration 5000 mg l it should be stress that many of the above conditions are typical for citrus wastewaters this enables the valorisation of these waste streams without the necessity of applying expensive and energy consuming processes credit author statement santo fabio corsino investigation data curation writing original draft marco capodici

8783,citrus wastewater is a sugar rich waste stream suitable for the recovery of energy of material from its treatment in this study fermentation of citrus wastewater was carried out to assess the optimal conditions to maximize the bioconversion of the organic substrate into acetate unbalanced nutrient c n p 200 0 1 0 1 enabled the highest acetate production the presence of the particulate organic fraction enabled to obtain a higher acetate concentration regardless the initial cod concentration initial ph values higher than 5 did not cause substantial differences on the maximum bioconversion of cod into acetate whereas ph lower than 5 hindered the hydrolysis process lastly the bioconversion rate of the organic substrate into acetate decreased from a maximum of 23 to a minimum of 8 related to the initial cod the achieved results demonstrated that the characteristics of citrus wastewater enable its valorisation without the need to apply energy consuming processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords acetate anaerobic process bioconversion citrus wastewater fermentation 1 introduction in the last decades environmental legislations promoted resources recovery from waste and wastewater streams 1 the will to apply the principles of the circular economy model in solid and liquid wastes management practices has addressed researchers to employ innovative solutions aimed at enhancing waste streams valorisation providing the simultaneous minimization of waste disposal and generation of value added products 2 the volatile fatty acids vfa are short chain organic compounds constituted by a number of carbon atoms of six or fewer 3 which are produced during acidogenesis when organic matter is degraded under anaerobic conditions 4 more precisely three processes are involved in vfa production hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis during hydrolysis complex organic polymers are broken down into simpler organic monomers which are subsequently fermented into acetic propionic and butyric acids during acidogenesis 5 finally during acetogenesis those products are converted into acetate vfa are valuable substrates that have a wide range of applications like biogas production in anaerobic digestion process in the food and pharmaceutical industries 3 carbon source for nitrogen and phosphorous removal in wastewater treatment plants or the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates pha for the production of bio based plastics 6 7 in all the above processes the yield and the quality of the final products i e biogas or pha are affected by the amount and composition of vfa deriving from the fermentation process 2 8 therefore the maximization of vfa production is often critical for the performances of the downstream processes according to the literature during anaerobic fermentation many factors might affect vfa production 6 9 among these environmental factors like ph and temperature as well as operating parameter such as hydraulic retention time hrt and organic loading rate olr have significant effects on the yield of vfa produced the research findings suggest that the optimal values of the operating parameters for vfa maximization are highly dependent on the carbon source used it seems that the proper operating parameters should be referred to the specific wastewater to be processed besides the operating parameters the production of vfa is substantially affected by the type of the waste wastewater 10 12 indeed researchers are still debating about which type of waste wastewater is more suitable for vfa production a suitable waste wastewater should be characterized by high content of organic substrates i e proteins carbohydrates fats etc low nitrogen content absence of toxic and recalcitrant compounds and high amount and availability of the waste itself 2 13 several solid and liquid wastes have been proposed in the literature for vfa production i e paper mill effluents cheese whey kitchen waste waste activated sludge etc 2 11 14 among these wastewater generated from agro based production are potentially considered amongst the most suitable to maximize vfa production because of the high content of organic matter chemical oxygen demand cod 4000 mg l and the low content of nitrogen that could inhibit the fermentation process 15 citrus wastewater are organic rich wastewater streams generated from citrus fruits processing including washing of fruits and machineries extraction of juice and essential oils as well as peel drying and cooling 16 citrus wastewaters are characterized by high content of organic matter suspended solids essential oils and generally low ph 3 as well as unbalanced nutrients due to the lack in nitrogen and phosphorous 17 the cod of citrus wastewater is generally high ranging between 1000 mg l and 10 000 mg l depending on the type of citrus fruit processed 18 moreover the cod is characterized by a very high biodegradability being the readily biodegradable fraction close to 70 19 based on the above characteristics citrus wastewater is potentially suitable for vfa production most of the studies referred to citrus waste fermentation indicated that the presence of some potential toxic substances such as limonene and other essential oils present in the peels of citrus fruits could result in the inhibition of fermentation process 20 21 many of these substances are usually recovered before juice extraction since their great economic value and accordingly their content in the wastewater deriving from juice processing is extremely low for this reason recovery of vfa from wastewater could be more convenient due to the lower amount of inhibiting substances however as authors are aware few studies dealing with vfa production from citrus wastewater and in general aimed at its valorisation have been reported in the technical literature so far 22 23 in this light the aim of the present study was to optimize vfa production from the fermentation of citrus wastewater more precisely this study investigated the role of some operating parameters like the nutrients carbon to nitrogen to phosphorous c n p ratio ph and the olr on the vfa production from the fermentation of a citrus processing wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 citrus wastewater characterization citrus wastewater samples were collected from a citrus processing industry located in palermo agrumaria corleone s p a citrus wastewater was generated from tangerines processing and were characterized in terms of ph electrical conductivity total suspended solids tss content total chemical oxygen demand tcod soluble chemical oxygen demand scod and vfa as acetate concentrations the main features of the citrus wastewater are summarized in table 1 2 2 experimental set up experiments were carried out in 1 l glass bottle reactors continuously mixed by a magnetic stirrer the filling ratio with wastewater was close to 95 to reduce the headspace volume and thus limiting the amount of oxygen that could dissolve in the liquid phase each reactor was subsequently hermetically sealed using a specific cap and a silicone gasket to avoid the air draw from the outside four trials were performed during the experimental campaign each having a duration of 21 days the reactors were fed in batch static mode meaning that neither feeding nor discharging excepting the samples for analyses were performed during the entire trials duration in each trial only one operating parameter was changed whereas the others were maintained constant the operating parameter that provided the highest acetate production in the previous trial was maintained during all the following trials in trial 1 the effect of carbon as tcod to nitrogen and phosphorous ratio c n p was evaluated to this aim three different batch reactors were started up with a different c n p ratio equal to 200 0 1 0 1 a1 200 5 1 a2 and 200 10 2 a3 more precisely in a1 no nitrogen neither phosphorous were added in the reactor thus maintaining the original c n p ratio of the raw citrus wastewater whereas in a2 and a3 ammonium chloride and potassium orthophosphate were added to obtain the desired c n p ratios in each reactor the raw citrus wastewater no clarification was diluted with tap water to obtain an initial tcod concentration of 4000 mg l and the ph was subsequently adjusted to neutral 7 by adding sodium hydroxide in trial 2 the effect of the particulate organic matter was studied in this case the citrus wastewater was subjected to static settling for 2 h and the supernatant was separated from the settled solids the total suspended solids concentration in the supernatant was negligible 5 mg l thus it was considered that all the particulate substances were removed therefore two reactors were started the first one with the supernatant of the citrus wastewater subjected to static settling 2 h b1 whereas the second one with the raw citrus wastewater thus including the settleable solids content b2 in both cases the citrus wastewater either clarified or not was diluted with tap water to obtain the same tcod concentration of the trial 1 4000 mg l and similarly ph was adjusted to neutral concerning the c n p ratio it was set equal to a1 no nitrogen and phosphorous supply because it resulted the best in terms of acetate production in the previous trial as better outlined in the following section 3 in trial 3 the effect of the initial ph was investigated based on the results obtained in the previous trials the citrus wastewater not clarified with a c n p ratio equal to 200 0 1 0 1 and a tcod of 4000 mg l after dilution was added in four reactors c1 c2 c3 and c4 afterwards the ph was adjusted to 7 in c1 6 in c2 5 in c3 and 4 in c4 by adding sodium hydroxide in trial 4 the effect of the initial tcod concentration was assessed four batch reactors were filled with not clarified citrus wastewater diluted with tap water according to different dilution factors in order to obtain an initial tcod concentration of 4000 mg l d1 8000 mg l d2 16 000 mg l d3 and 32 000 mg l d4 according to the best results achieved in trial 3 the ph was adjusted to 7 during trial 1 the reactors were operated at room temperature 15 2 c whereas in the other trials the reactors were maintained at controlled temperature 20 0 1 c the ph was daily measured in all the trials but was not controlled during the experiment excepting at day zero a small volume 2 ml was sampled daily from each reactor in all the trials in order to measure the vfa as acetate concentration no bacterial inoculum was added in the different trials since fermentative microorganisms were already present in the initial wastewater in fig 1 a summary of the trials operating conditions is reported 2 3 analytical methods all the physical chemical analyses including tss scod tcod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp were performed according to standard methods 24 the ph was measured using a ph meter wtw sentix 9xx connected to a wtw 3430 multi meter naoh was used in order to adjust the ph at the desired value samples from each reactor were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane before measuring the acetate concentration by means of an ion chromatograph dionex dx 120 a reference curve was constructed by using a pure standard of acetate in the range of 1 10 000 mg l for further details the reader is referred to the literature 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of c n p ratio trial 1 in trial 1 the effect of different c n p ratios on the acetate production was studied fig 2 the initial acetate concentration in the citrus wastewater was about 20 mg l as depicted in fig 2a the acetate concentration slightly decreased after the first day in all the reactors but it significantly increased on day 2 more precisely the acetate concentration raised from 1 90 mg l to 601 mg l 576 mg l and 520 mg l in a1 a2 and a3 respectively thus the maximum acetate concentration was achieved in the reactor operating under unbalanced nutrient condition c n p 200 0 1 0 1 although the difference in the acetate production was marginal 10 15 compared to the other batch reactors similar results were found in the literature 26 in which the authors observed that nitrogen and phosphorus affected the acetate production in the acidogenic reactor in particular boonsawang and co authors 26 observed that the maximum production of acetate was obtained at cod n p of 100 1 1 0 5 treating biodiesel wastewater whereas fu and co authors found that a c n ratio of 30 maximized the acetate production from textile wastewater 27 similar results were also reported by liu et al 28 which observed that the maximum yield production of vfa was achieved under the highest c n ratio investigated 50 1 also huang and co authors in a recent study observed that the yield of vfa production increased with c n and the amount of acetate was proportional to the carbohydrate content of the waste subjected to fermentation 29 at the same time ph decreased in all the reactors from 7 to 5 4 5 9 and 6 3 in a1 a2 and a3 respectively fig 2b indicating that the ph decrease was proportional to the acetate production after day 2 the acetate concentrations decreased in all the reactors although with different trends indeed in a1 the acetate concentration decreased to a minimum value of 270 mg l on the 7th day whereas in a2 and a3 the acetate almost disappeared 15 mg l during this phase the ph increased in all the reactors reaching values of 6 80 7 45 and 7 50 in a1 a2 and a3 respectively when the acetate concentration was minimum atasoy et al 6 reported that under no ph control the acetate production is characterized by significant variation because of the development of different bacterial strains during the fermentation process more recently another study demonstrated that under uncontrolled ph the acetate consumption could be observed because its production and degradation by methanogens could occur simultaneously 30 however operating at high c n might minimize this effect because it reduces the growth rate of methanogens 31 32 after this transition period the acetate concentration started to increase again in a1 although with a lower rate compared to the previous one the maximum acetate concentration was reached on the 15th day 723 mg l and it remained almost stable at this value for about 5 days after which it slightly decreased reaching a value of approximately 600 mg l at the end of the observed period in this phase the acetate accounted for approximately 50 of the scod and 40 of the tcod accordingly ph decreased in this period remaining stably close to 6 until the end of the trial in contrast to what observed in a1 no further acetate production was observed in a2 and a3 after that the minimum value was reached and ph remained close to neutral in both the reactors the decrease of acetate concentration observed after the 2nd day was directly proportional to the c n p ratio indeed in the literature it is widely reported as a condition of nutrients balance is favourable to the synthesis process of bacteria that might led to the consumption of the acetate produced during fermentation 33 therefore in a2 and a3 the higher availability of nutrients likely favoured the growth of bacteria and consequently the higher consumption of the acetate previously produced 30 nevertheless even in a1 the acetate concentration decreased thereby suggesting that the occurrence of bacterial growth phenomena even if minimal it is worth to observe that after the 2nd day the ph increased in all the reactors suggesting the occurrence of hydrolysis reactions involving the particulate organic fraction in the citrus wastewater according to literature 34 indeed the recovery of the acetate production in a1 was due to the fermentation of the hydrolysed products previously produced because the hydrolysis process involves complex reactions the production rate of the soluble organic molecules ready to be fermented is low 2 this certainly limited the rate of acetate production that was lower compared with that observed until day 2 when the organic matter available for the fermentation process was already in the soluble form in a2 and a3 the organic matter deriving from the hydrolysis of the particulate one was likely simultaneously used by bacteria for growth purpose thus reducing its availability for the fermentation reactions in a1 the consumption of the acetate by bacteria was minimized because of the low c n p thereby favouring the fermentation reactions over new biomass synthesis based on the above results unbalanced nutrient condition is preferable for the acetate production from citrus wastewater fermentation indeed it allowed achieving a higher bioconversion of both the soluble and particulate cod into acetate while preventing the use of the organic matter by bacteria for growth the above results are consistent with the current literature results highlighting that unbalanced nutrient condition high c n are favourable not only to promote the vfas production but also to suppress the consumption of vfas 6 29 31 3 2 effect of settleable solids removal trial 2 in trial 2 two batch reactors with raw b1 and clarified b2 citrus wastewater were started fig 3 shows the trend profiles of the acetate concentration fig 3a and ph fig 3b during the experiment the trend of the acetate concentrations and ph in b1 were very similar with those observed in a1 because the operating conditions were basically the same this confirmed the repeatability and reproducibility of the achieved results in more detail as reported in fig 3a a first peak in the acetate concentration was observed on the 2nd day of operation according with that observed in trial 1 however in this case the concentration of the acetate was approximately 50 higher 900 mg l vs 600 mg l likely due to the higher temperature in b1 20 c vs 16 c hereafter the decrease of the acetate concentration and its further increase due to hydrolysis of the particulate substrate nearly followed that observed in a1 the trend of the acetate concentration in b2 rapidly increased at the beginning of the experiment reaching the maximum value of 419 mg l on day 2 in the three following days the acetate concentration slightly decreased by approximately 13 357 mg l on the 5th day while remaining almost constant until the end of the observed period although the initial tcod concentration was the same in b1 and b2 the highest value of acetate concentration was observed in b1 the reason for this result could be twofold first in b2 bacteria were present in a lower amount in the reactor because being mainly in particulate form were removed during the sample pre treatment thus reducing the efficiency of the acidification process in this way the solids removal caused a decrease of the indigenous biomass responsible of fermentation and as a result the reduction of acetate production this results is consistent with recent studies in which the authors reported that a no acclimated inoculum could led to a lower yield of vfa production 32 35 second it could be possible that the hydrolysis of the particulate organic matter occurred also in the early stage of the experiment in b1 leading to a higher availability of soluble products to be fermented 36 in this light literature results reported that low availability of acetate gives a competitive advantage to methanogens bacteria given their lower growth rate compared to that of acidifying bacteria 31 therefore if the acidogenesis process is slow simultaneous acetate consumption by methanogens could occur moreover it is worth noting that the decrease of the acetate concentration in the long term was lower in b2 65 in b1 vs 13 in b2 thereby indicating that the removal of the particulate matter could beneficial in preventing the acetate deterioration this result confirmed that inhibition of methanogens bacteria or their removal as in this case could be an effective strategy to suppress the acetate consumption 31 the results obtained in trial 2 highlighted the role of the particulate organic matter in acetate production by the fermentation process indeed on the one hand the presence of the particulate organic fraction enabled to obtain a higher acetate concentration independently of the initial cod concentration but on the other hand it was likely responsible for the acetate decrease in the long term based on the above results a possible operating strategy could be the separation of the particulate matter after the achievement of the first peak of the acetate concentration although a similar result in terms of the acetate production yield was achievable after approximately 15 days this strategy would require a higher storage capacity for the fermenting reactors hence higher investment costs 3 3 effect of the initial ph trial 3 in trial 3 the effect of the initial ph value was evaluated fig 4 depicts the trends of the acetate concentration fig 4a and ph fig 4b during the trial 3 in this trial the reactor c1 was not started because the operating conditions were the same of b1 and reproducibility of the test was previously demonstrated therefore the data achieved in the previous trial referred to the reactor b1 were considered as the same of c1 in trial 3 a similar behaviour was observed in c1 c2 and c3 in terms of acetate production during the entire experiment more precisely the first peak was noted after 2 days in all reactors the maximum acetate concentration was very similar in the above cited reactors 800 900 mg l although showing a slighter decrease with lower ph values confirming that low ph likely hindered fermentation reactions 37 in contrast the minimum value of ph measured on day 2 was different in c1 c2 and c3 fig 4b indeed the lowest ph values were measured in c3 3 68 and c2 3 80 whereas it was higher in c1 5 4 hereafter ph increased in all the reactors although in c2 and c3 it was constantly lower than c1 this result likely affected the hydrolysis processes in c2 and c3 and consequently the recovery of the acetate production after the 10th day was lower compared to c1 in particular the maximum concentrations achieved in c2 and c3 were approximately 50 410 mg l vs 790 mg l and 70 260 mg l vs 790 mg l lower compared to that of c1 this result indicated that low ph are not favourable to the hydrolysis process thereby confirming what reported in the literature 27 38 in contrast the trend of acetate production in c4 was completely different with those above discussed indeed the acetate concentration increased very slowly at the beginning of the experiment reaching a maximum value close to 400 mg l on day 4 subsequently this concentration remained almost constant for about 7 days while showing a slow decrease afterwards almost halving at the end of the experiment in contrast with the other reactors the recovery of the acetate production due to hydrolysis of the particulate organic matter was not observed in c4 this result confirmed that low ph values are not favourable for the hydrolysis process and even at ph lower than 4 this was completely inhibited 37 38 another difference was observed in terms of acetate decrease after the first peak indeed while in c1 c2 and c3 the acetate concentration decreased proportionally to the ph decrease in reactor c4 instead the decrease of the acetate concentration was smaller in terms of absolute value compared with the other reactors 45 and it showed a slow decrease in time according to what previously discussed the aforementioned results are in good agreement with previous literature results revealing that neutral or alkaline conditions can potentially accelerate the solubilization of organic particles whereas acidic conditions can inhibit the process 39 based on the above results it can be stated that the maximum production of acetate on the soluble cod first peak was comparable in c1 c2 and c3 whereas in c4 it was significantly lower these results suggested that initial ph values higher than 5 did not cause substantial differences referring to the maximum bioconversion of cod into acetate whereas ph lower than 5 caused a slowdown of the start up of fermentation reactions moreover the acetate deterioration increased with the ph decrease in the range of 5 7 whereas at lower ph it was shifted in time and was lower in percentage terms lastly the hydrolysis process was hindered with the ph decrease while it completely stopped at ph lower than 5 as reported in the literature ph of 7 was found the most suitable for hydrolysis and acidogenesis of kitchen waste leading to the highest vfas concentrations in comparison with other ph values 40 the above results are consistent with previous literature in which it was demonstrated that under uncontrolled ph conditions the acetate production is variable during the fermentation process and the highest acetate production was achieved at ph close to 7 30 moreover these results also agreed with the previous finding that the neutral conditions could improve the hydrolysis efficiency of organic substrates 41 3 4 effect of the initial cod concentration trial 4 the effect of different initial cod concentrations was evaluated in trial 4 fig 5 depicts the trend profiles of the acetate concentration fig 5a and ph fig 5b as well as the relationships between the cod with the maximum acetate production and the maximum acetate bioconversion rate fig 5c for the same reason explained in trial 3 the data referred to the reactor d1 are the same of b1 trial 2 as reported in fig 5a the trends of the acetate production were similar in d1 d2 and d3 whereas it was slightly different in d4 especially in the second phase of the experiment more in detail as observed in the previous trials a first peak in the acetate production from the scod was observed in the very first days after the start up of the experiment in particular the maximum acetate production was observed in d4 2850 mg l followed by d3 1403 mg l d2 1195 mg l and lastly d1 901 2 mg l thereby highlighting a certain relationship with the initial tcod concentration moreover it was noted that the maximum acetate production occurred earlier with the increase of the initial tcod concentration indeed in d3 and d4 the maximum acetate concentration was observed after one day from the beginning of the experiment whereas in d1 and d2 after two days hereafter as also observed during the previous trials in all the reactors the acetate concentration slightly decreased referring to the ph trend fig 5b the drop of ph occurring during the early stage of the experiment was proportional to the initial cod concentration therefore the minimum ph values were observed in d4 3 81 and d3 4 01 whereas in d2 and d1 it was higher and close to 5 and 5 4 in d2 and d1 respectively according to what observed in trial 3 the decrease of the acetate concentration was smaller at low ph therefore it could be stated that the smaller rates of the acetate decrease observed in d4 and d3 were due to the lower ph values hereafter the acetate concentration increased in all the reactors due to hydrolysis of particulate cod in this case the acetate production was not proportional to the initial tcod indeed compared to the minimum value in each reactor the acetate concentration increased by approximately 20 in d4 45 in d3 and about 200 in d2 and d1 even in this case the reason of this result could be due to the lower ph values in d3 close to 4 and d4 that somehow hindered the hydrolysis processes the maximum acetate concentration obtained in each reactor was also related to the initial tcod concentration as shown in fig 5c the maximum acetate production did not increase proportionally to the initial tcod concentration and the relationship was asymptotic similarly the maximum bioconversion rate of the tcod to acetate decreased with the initial cod concentration this meant that the increase of the initial cod concentration is not associated to a higher bioconversion rate of the organic substrate to acetate the above results were consistent with previous literature and in particular with the results reported by kaushalya et al 42 in more detail the authors referred that an increase in vfa production was observed as the organic loading rate increased although the increment was not proportional at each step in another study the authors observed that the acetate production increased with olr although the conversion yield of cod to acetate decreased proportionally with the olr 43 according to the authors findings the higher is the cod concentration the higher is the reduction in the kinetic of vfa production consequently proper cod concentration should be carefully ensured to enable maximization of acetate production as previously discussed this result is likely due to an excessive decrease of the ph observed in those reactors with the higher initial tcod concentration it is reasonable to state that the limiting process was the hydrolysis of the particulate cod due to the low ph that likely reduced the enzymatic ability to hydrolyse the organic substrate indeed cheah and co authors 34 demonstrated that at high cod concentration vfa production was not inhibited if ph was controlled at approximately 6 therefore in this study the simultaneous high cod concentration and the uncontrolled ph during fermentation led to the gradual decrease in vfa production because of acidogenic bacteria inhibition due to ph in this respect a control of the ph during the fermentation process could be beneficial to foster the establishment of the proper conditions for hydrolysis the above results are consistent with the literature indeed vfa concentration produced from different types of wastewater rarely increased with the initial cod concentration whilst it was found that the maximum of vfa production was achievable only within a specific range dependent on the wastewater and other operating conditions 2 6 3 5 general considerations for practical implementations the results obtained in the above discussed trials indicated that environmental and operating conditions could significantly affect the acetate production from the fermentation of citrus wastewater the unbalance of nutrients typical for citrus wastewaters is beneficial for maximizing the acetate production certainly the unbalance of nutrients could cause severe issues for the treatment of such wastewater thus the dosage of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous should be performed only after the fermentation process regarding the pre treatment through clarification it was observed that this would reduce the maximum acetate production but at the same time it might prevent the acetate decrease in the long term moreover the removal of the particulate matter hindered the chance to recover acetate from the fermentation of the particulate organic fraction therefore a possible and advisable operating strategy could be the separation of the soluble and particulate fractions after some operating days as suggested by conca et al 44 in this way the soluble fraction could be immediately used or stored without any risks of acetate deterioration in contrast the particulate fraction could be left to ferment although this would imply a higher volume of the fermenter reactor at the end of this phase the fermented wastewater should be filtered to separate the citrus wastewater enriched in acetate from the residual particulate fraction regarding the ph it was observed that the maximum acetate production on the soluble fraction of the cod was independent of ph in a range of 5 7 based on the achieved results it would be convenient to carry out the first stage of the fermentation at low ph 5 because the raw citrus wastewaters have ph close to 3 and this would require a low amount of buffer reagents to adjust the ph however to favour the hydrolysis of the particulate fraction ph should be later adjusted to neutral values the initial tcod concentration affected the maximum acetate production although the bioconversion rate significantly decreased at high cod however from an operating point of view the management of the initial tcod concentration is not easy to perform because it depends on the production processes and on the kind of fruits that change periodically and unpredictable the adjustment of the initial tcod concentration is also a crucial step prior to perform the biological treatment of citrus wastewater in order to avoid an overload of the biological system practically this is commonly obtained by mixing different streams having different cod values but obviously this would imply a high storage capacity within the production site the same practise could be implemented with the aim to maximize the cod bioconversion to acetate referring to the acetate production after hydrolysis it was observed that the lower production achieved in the reactors operating with higher cod was likely due to the low ph indeed as observed in trial 3 at ph lower than 4 the hydrolysis of the particulate matter was limited thus the ph adjustment could prevent the slowdown or shutdown of the hydrolysis process thereby making available also the acetate fraction achievable from the particulate cod based on what discussed so far a possible process scheme could involve the following steps adjustment of the initial cod concentration to a value close to 4000 5000 mg l initial ph adjustment to 5 and neither clarification or nutrients dosage nitrogen and or phosphorous solid liquid separation after approximately 48 h with the liquid fraction ready to be used or stored dosage of alkaline reagents ph to 7 in the fermenter reactor with the particulate matter a conceptual scheme based on the above considerations is reported in fig 6 4 conclusions in this study the effects of some operating parameters on the production of acetate from citrus wastewater were evaluated the production of acetate was significantly affected by all the investigated parameters in particular the nutrients unbalance and the presence of the particulate fraction were found to be beneficial for maximizing the acetate production moreover initial low ph close to 5 are preferable to obtain high acetate production in the short term while avoiding excessive operating costs for ph adjustment furthermore ph close to neutral should be ensured in the long term to enable the hydrolysis of the particulate organic fraction the clarification of the citrus wastewater prior to fermentation prevented the decrease of the acetate concentration in the long term although reducing the maximum acetate production lastly the bioconversion rate from cod to acetate significantly decreased at high cod thus suggesting the advisability to operate at low initial tcod concentration 5000 mg l it should be stress that many of the above conditions are typical for citrus wastewaters this enables the valorisation of these waste streams without the necessity of applying expensive and energy consuming processes credit author statement santo fabio corsino investigation data curation writing original draft marco capodici

chlorides in the concentrate stream space time of the electrodialyzer and the applied current density chloride concentration achievable in a 100 cm long electrodialyzer unit was estimated at a linear flow velocity range of 0 15 0 42 cm s and current density range of 400 650 a m2 the results are presented in figs 1 and 2 the results indicate that it should be possible to reach the desired level 180 g dm 3 of chlorides in electrodialysis if the membrane length is 100 cm and the electrodialysis works on the ro retentate however it s not possible to produce saturated brine if the electrodialysis works directly on the coal mine water at least in the investigated conditions membrane length 100 cm current density 400 650 a m 2 concentrate linear flow velocity 0 15 0 42 cm s 1 the results are in agreement with the results obtained by casas et al 16 17 who modelled a pilot ed plant for swro brine concentrations based on the nernst planck equation and mass balance equations they have developed a model describing the plant performance with respect to the transport of sodium chloride however calcium and magnesium transport was neglected although the desired chlor alkali feed concentration of 300 g l as nacl was not reached in the experiments because current density was not high enough the model predicted that such concentrations should be reached in the investigated plant at ca 600 700 a m2 after 25 28 h of operation inlet concentration ca 65 g l as nacl it s also worth to note that the results predict it should be possible to cross the sodium chloride solubility ca 192 g l as cl at room temperature although this may be hard to achieve practically given it requires simultaneously very high current density and very low linear flow velocity in the concentrate compartment it indicates a possibility of electrochemically driven membrane crystallization of sodium chloride to occur this is a subject of a separate ongoing study 3 2 cost analysis the cost analysis was performed for the second case ed working on the model solution resembling retentate from nf ro system working on the bolesław śmiały coal mine water in order to estimate costs of electrodialytic brine

7257 in the industrial scale electrodialyzer the voltage drop on the electrodes and in the anolyte catholyte compartments is negligible compared to the voltage drop on the membrane stack itself however in the case of bench scale studies when small number of membrane cells is used 4 in this experiments the voltage drop on the electrodes and in the catholyte anolyte compartment is disproportionally large compared to the voltage drop on the membrane stack to mitigate this issue and better translate the collected laboratory data into large scale electrodialysis it was assumed that the intercept of eqn 11 is equal to the voltage drop outside the membrane stack meaning the voltage drop of electrode reaction and the voltage drop in the 0 36 mm channel filled with 0 5 m sodium sulfate solution would be 1 36 v per cathode and anode each which is a reasonable value the correlation between the current density and voltage was thus assumed as 13 u 0 0151 i 2 calculate the dc

is presented in fig 3 the costs are highly dependent on the applied current density ranging from ca 20 m 3 to 40 m 3 but the concentrate linear flow velocity has almost negligible effect this is because the majority 81 92 of the costs are the dc energy costs this suggests the necessity for investigating membranes with lower electric resistance and intermembrane spacers with better mass transfer coefficients even at the cost of increasing the equipment or pumping costs such membrane properties could be achieved by fabricating thinner homogenous membranes even at the cost of lowering their mechanical strength because the linear flow velocities are low this may be the way to go further with membrane development at least for the specific use case discussed here on the other hand decreasing the membrane thickness may lead to increased osmotic water flux significant factor if high concentration difference between the diluate and concentrate is desired and eventually prohibit the electrodialysis from achieving high sodium chloride concentration in the concentrate stream 4 conclusions a semi empirical mass transfer model describing the ions and water transport across the ion exchange membranes was established and used for the prediction of maximum attainable chloride concentration in the industrial scale electrodialyzer it was found that the electrodialysis of the bolesław śmiały coal mine water can be applied as a method for the production of concentrated solution 180 g dm 3 as cl a raw material for evaporated salt production as long as the raw coal mine water is pre concentrated in the nf ro system the projected costs of saturated brine production range from 20 to 40 m 3 with the dc energy costs being the major contribution author statement krzysztof mitko

molar flux of i th ion ji was calculated as 1 j i c i c u c c i f u c f a m i a m where ci c is the concentration of i th ion in the concentrate ci f is the concentration of i th ion the feed uc is the concentrate linear flow velocity uc f is the feed linear flow velocity on the concentrate side a is the cross section area of the flow 4 compartments x 0 36 mm spacer x 2 cm channel width am is the single membrane area 84 cm2 and mi is the molar mass of i th ion the water flux jw was calculated as 2 j w u c u c f a a m the concentration gradient across the membrane was assumed as the difference between the average chloride concentration in both compartments 3 δ c c c l f c c l d 2 c c l f c c l c 2 the water flux in electrodialysis is a combination of osmosis concentration gradient dependent mostly negligible due to extremely low hydraulic permeability of ion exchange membranes and electroosmosis current density dependent following model was assumed to explain the water transport across the membrane 4 j w a 1 i the ionic flux in electrodialysis follows the nernst planck equation so following model was assumed to explain the chloride molar flux 5 j c l a 2 δ c a 3 i where i is the applied current density next for the sake of simplicity instead of calculating fluxes of each remaining ions the change in the remaining ions concentration was calculated as 6 c s o 4 2

scale unit an empirical model was developed linking the inlet concentrate linear flow velocity and applied current density 9 c c l c a 7 τ a 8 i where the space time is given by 10 τ l u c f where l is the module length in the case of experimental unit 42 cm based on the obtained model a maximum chloride concentration achievable in a pilot scale electrodialyzer of 100 cm membrane length was estimated the values of a1 a8 parameters were estimated using levenberg marquardt non linear least squares algorithm as implemented in minpack lm module of gnu r statistical software and are presented in tables 4 and 5 the analysis shows that it is possible to predict the ionic fluxes and water flux across the neosepta cmx amx membranes in the tested conditions counter current single pass operation 0 36 mm intermembrane spacers knowing the applied current density feed concentration and the required diluate and concentrate concentrations based on the empirical model linking the concentration of chlorides in the concentrate stream space time of the electrodialyzer and the applied current density chloride concentration achievable in a 100 cm long electrodialyzer unit was estimated at a linear flow velocity range of 0 15 0 42 cm s and current density range of 400 650 a m2 the results are presented in figs 1 and 2 the results indicate that it should be possible to reach the desired level 180 g dm 3 of chlorides in electrodialysis if the membrane length is 100 cm and the electrodialysis works on the ro retentate however it s not possible to produce saturated brine if the electrodialysis works directly on the coal mine water at least in the investigated conditions membrane length 100 cm current density 400 650 a m 2 concentrate linear flow velocity 0 15 0 42 cm s 1 the results are in agreement with the results obtained by casas et al 16 17 who modelled a pilot ed plant for swro brine concentrations based on the nernst planck equation and mass balance equations they have developed a model describing the plant performance with respect to the transport of sodium chloride however calcium and magnesium transport was neglected although the desired chlor alkali feed concentration of 300 g l as nacl was not reached in the experiments because current density was not high enough the model predicted that such concentrations should be reached in the investigated plant at ca 600 700 a m2 after 25 28 h of operation inlet concentration ca 65 g l as nacl it s also worth to note that the results predict it should be possible to cross the sodium chloride solubility ca 192 g l as cl at room temperature although this may be hard to achieve practically given it requires simultaneously very high current density and very low linear flow velocity in the concentrate compartment it indicates a possibility of electrochemically driven membrane crystallization of sodium chloride to occur this is a subject of a separate ongoing study 3 2 cost analysis the cost analysis was performed for the second case ed working on the model solution resembling retentate from nf ro system working on the bolesław śmiały coal mine water in order to estimate costs of electrodialytic brine production following model has been assumed 1 calculate the membrane length required for obtaining 180 g dm 3 as cl given the concentrate linear flow velocity and current density by rearranging eqns 9

7257 in the industrial scale electrodialyzer the voltage drop on the electrodes and in the anolyte catholyte compartments is negligible compared to the voltage drop on the membrane stack itself however in the case of bench scale studies when small number of membrane cells is used 4 in this experiments the voltage drop on the electrodes and in the catholyte anolyte compartment is disproportionally large compared to the voltage drop on the membrane stack to mitigate this issue and better translate the collected laboratory data into large scale electrodialysis it was assumed that the intercept of eqn 11 is equal to the voltage drop outside the membrane stack meaning the voltage drop of electrode reaction and the voltage drop in the 0 36 mm channel filled with 0 5 m sodium sulfate solution would be 1 36 v per cathode and anode each which is a reasonable value the correlation between the current density and voltage was thus assumed as 13 u 0 0151 i 2 calculate the dc

δ p 0 0862 u c f l the overall costs c m 3 are given by the equation 18 c c d c c c a p c p u m p the influence of current density and the concentrate linear flow velocity on the saturated brine costs is presented in fig 3 the costs are highly dependent on the applied current density ranging from ca 20 m 3 to 40 m 3 but the concentrate linear flow velocity has almost negligible effect this is because the majority 81 92 of the costs are the dc energy costs this suggests the necessity for investigating membranes with lower electric resistance and intermembrane spacers with better mass transfer coefficients even at the cost of increasing the equipment or pumping costs such membrane properties could be achieved by fabricating thinner homogenous membranes even at the cost of lowering their mechanical strength because the linear flow velocities are low this may be the way to go further with membrane development at least for the specific use case discussed here on the other hand decreasing the membrane thickness may lead to increased osmotic water flux significant factor if high concentration difference between the diluate and concentrate is desired and eventually prohibit the electrodialysis from achieving high sodium chloride concentration in the concentrate stream 4 conclusions a semi empirical mass transfer model describing the ions and water transport across the ion exchange membranes was established and used for the prediction of maximum attainable chloride concentration in the industrial scale electrodialyzer it was found that the electrodialysis of the bolesław śmiały coal mine water can be applied as a method for the production of concentrated solution 180 g dm 3 as cl a raw material for evaporated salt production as long as the raw coal mine water is pre concentrated in the nf ro system the projected costs of saturated brine production range from 20 to 40 m 3 with the dc energy costs being the major contribution author statement krzysztof mitko
