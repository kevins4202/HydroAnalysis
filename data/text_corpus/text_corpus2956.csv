14780,interaction between natural organic matters nom and heavy metal cations in aqueous environment are of great significance for maintaining stability of organic carbon and restraining transport of heavy metal contaminants in bio geochemical processes we systematically explore the aggregation process and complexation between nom and heavy metal cations ag cd2 pb2 zn2 eu3 under different ph condition by molecular dynamics md simulations umbrella sampling method and quantum chemistry calculations the character of molecular structures nom heavy metal complexes and association are quantified in acidic ph condition aggregation proceeds via h bonding and π π interactions between nom fragments in neutral condition ag cd2 pb2 and eu3 can form inner sphere complexes with the surface carboxylic groups and therefore reduce intermolecular charge repulsion eventually leading to nom aggregation and it shows that even without direct binding the outer sphere adsorbed zn2 can also result in the formation of nom assemble through h bonding consequently these heavy metals are capable of promoting nom aggregation regardless of the complexing ways complexing free energy calculations characterized the dynamic processes of cations binding to the carboxylic groups of nom fragment and the related energy landscape this study provides quantitative insights for understanding the environmental processes of heavy metals and cycle of c in aquatic ecosystem and contributes to developing environment friendly strategies for controlling heavy metal contaminants graphical abstract

introduction natural organic matter nom a heterogeneous and incompletely characterized supramolecular mixture with a variety of aliphatic and aromatic compounds and abundant surface functional groups is present ubiquitously in the environment and play a crucial role in global carbon cycle e g organic carbon reservation and sequestration kellerman et al 2015 świetlik and sikorska 2006 wu et al 2007 nom has been considered as both a source and sink for organic carbon which may have an indirect climatic effect delpla et al 2009 dore 2005 hruska et al 2009 in addition nom influences the concentrations of dissolved o n p and s and serve as a carrier of toxic pollutants like heavy metal cations santschi et al 2017 tipping 2002 heavy metal cations are usually released into the environment as a result of industrial activities such as battery manufacture mining and metallurgical fertilizer industries hajji et al 2019 knauer et al 2017 they can be transferred into the human and other life organisms via inhalation ingestion and skin adsorption causing irreversible disruptions potgieter et al 2006 metal nom interactions largely govern the speciation solubility transport and toxicity of trace metals in aqueous environment consequently it is essential to deeply elucidate the interaction processes between nom and heavy metal cations and the relevant molecular level mechanisms which is important for understanding the aggregation and stabilization of nom supramolecular structure and the environmental fate of heavy metals that are the major focus of aquatic environmental chemistry over years there have been numerous studies exploring the interaction between nom and heavy metal cations using traditional experimental methods for example yang et al 2015 sequentially extracted four humic acids ha fractions from a single sediment and conducted the sorption experiments of cu2 on these ha fractions their results showed that aromaticity and acidic group content of ha fraction decreased with increasing extraction and earlier extracted ha fraction had higher sorption capacity and affinity for cu2 bai et al 2018 illustrated that the different effects of ha molecular weight on cd2 binding were attributed to the functional group content carboxylic and phenolic groups and structural properties by fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem quenching the results of their study also showed that the ha with molecular weight below 5 kda uf1 could bind large amounts of cd2 but the binding affinity was lower than for uf4 30 kda nevertheless nom are structurally complex and heterogeneous with a large diversity in its composition and therefore it is hard to quantitatively clarify the complexation and aggregation mechanism with heavy metal cations at the molecular scale e g identification of active binding sites detailed microscopic complexing geometries observation of dynamic binding and aggregation processes and thermodynamics of reactions molecular dynamics md is a powerful computer simulation technique which is widely used in field of environmental science and aqueous chemistry gerzabek et al 2022 greathouse et al 2014 kunhi mouvenchery et al 2011 liu et al 2022 orsi 2014 by analyzing a range of physicochemical properties the structural thermodynamic and dynamical properties of substances can be revealed at molecular level md simulations have been proven as a beneficial supplement to traditional experimental studies with regard to the nom metal cations interactions ai et al 2020 devarajan et al 2020 galicia andrés et al 2021 iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 kalinichev et al 2011 kalinichev and kirkpatrick 2007 zhang et al 2020 for example galicia andrés et al 2021 performed md simulations to explain the influence of cations and hydrogen bonds in nom stabilization and the different cation nom complex structures and their distribution were explored moreover quantum chemistry calculations based on density functional theory dft can reveal the structural and electronic properties of complexing systems du et al 2022 qi et al 2022 wang et al 2021 in summary previous studies have confirmed that the solution ph and cation types greatly influence the aggregation process and supramolecular structure of nom in the presence of metal cations notably it remains an open question that how will the interactions between different types of heavy metal cations and nom affect the aggregation and stabilization behavior of nom which is key to understand the availability and transport of heavy metal cations in supergene environment as well as the aggregation and stabilization nom when coexisting with heavy metal contaminants even though the microscopic complexing structure of heavy metal cations adsorbed on nom functional groups has been proposed more or less in available literatures there is still a lack of quantitative free energy data that helps us understand the dynamic complexing processes and binding strengths from a thermodynamic perspective to accurately understand the binding mechanism of heavy metal cations on nom and the aggregation process of nom induced by different heavy metal cations the interfacial interaction between nom and heavy metal cations has been systematically investigated using md simulations and related free energy calculations technique in association with quantum chemistry calculations monovalent ag bivalent cd2 pb2 zn2 and trivalent eu3 cations were selected as model cations to reveal their interaction mechanism with nom under different ph conditions neutral and acidic conditions the derived time averaged statistical data qualitatively characterize the aggregation and stabilization mechanism of nom and the adsorption geometries on nom functional groups and elucidate kinetic and dynamics characteristics of heavy metal cations nom complexes association free energies of cation nom in solution calculated by umbrella sampling simulations fully reveal the quantitative binding mechanism our study provides novel insights for understanding the dynamic nom heavy metal interactions from the quantitative perspective with implications on the fate of heavy metal contaminants and stabilization of organic carbon in natural aqueous environment 2 methodology 2 1 models the temple northeastern birmingham tnb model shown in fig s1 in supporting information si is a classical nom model works because of the similarity of tnb composition to natural nom davies et al 1997 jansen et al 1996 kubicki and apitz 1999 sein et al 1998 the fragment of tnb is composed by three carboxylic group three carbonyl groups two phenolic groups two amine groups and four alcohol groups with a total chemical formula of c36h40o16n2 in fully protonated state in our simulations the protonation states of carboxyl groups were adjusted to predict the behavior of nom at different ph conditions neutral and acidic condition ritchie and perdue 2003 has shown that the carboxyl groups of tnb model have a pk a of 4 to 5 and therefore they can be deprotonated under neutral condition and remain protonated under acidic condition while the phenolic groups pk a 9 should be completely protonated under both conditions therefore the negative charges of nom in near neutral environment arise from the deprotonated carboxyl groups which are also the potential binding sites for heavy metal cations so far tnb models have been widely used in molecular simulations of the aqueous environmental processes of nom ai et al 2020 iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 kalinichev et al 2011 tan et al 2018 tan et al 2019 five types of heavy metal cations ag cd2 pb2 zn2 eu3 were studied to represent different valences and each cation was simulated in individual system with the concentration of 0 2 mol l taking cd2 systems as an example its initial configuration is shown in fig 1 in all of the simulated systems the excess negative or positive charges were neutralized by na and cl respectively as a result there were 10 individual simulation systems in total whose compositional details are listed in table s1 all of the simulation cells were repeated in three dimensions abiding by the periodic boundary conditions 2 2 md simulations md simulations were carried out by gromacs 2018 4 package abraham et al 2015 van der spoel et al 2005 total potential interaction energy included bonding and non bonding terms non bonded interactions included coulombic e coul i j i q i q j 4 π r i j ε 0 and van der waals terms e vdw i j i 4 ε ij σ ij r ij 12 σ ij r ij 6 the cross interaction was accounted for by ε ij and σ ij ε ij ε i ε j σ ij 1 2 σ i σ j qi and qj were the atomic charges of atom i and j respectively rij was the distance between atom i and atom j and ε0 was the vacuum dielectric constant frenkel et al 1997 cutoff for short range and long range interactions was 12 å the particle mesh ewald pme method essmann et al 1995 was employed for electrostatic energy in present study the nom model was parameterized by amber 03 force field duan et al 2003 the extended simple point charge spc e water model was used berendsen et al 1987 the parameters employed for ag cd2 pb2 zn2 eu3 cations were adopted from previous studies de araujo et al 2007 duvail and guilbaud 2011 ekhteiari salmas et al 2013 khanmohammadi et al 2019 vanommeslaeghe et al 2010 which are summarized in table s2 the structure optimization of tnb by dft calculations was conducted at the quantum chemistry level of def2 tzvp basis set weigend and ahlrichs 2005 and b3lyp functional becke 1993 lee et al 1988 by gaussian 16 m j frisch 2016 the partial atomic charges of tnb were derived on the basis of the restrained electrostatic potential resp christopher i bayly 1993 that were obtained by multifwn 3 8 program lu and chen 2012 the acquired resp atomic charges of tnb model were used in md simulations leap frog algorithm hockney et al 1974 was used for integration of motion equation berendsen barostat berendsen et al 1984 and velocity rescale thermostat bussi et al 2007 were used for each simulation the system was pre equilibrated for 0 5 ns in nvt constant number volume and temperature ensemble at 298 k and subsequently for 2 ns equilibration in npt constant number pressure and temperature ensemble at 1 atm and 298 k production run of 100 ns in nvt ensemble was performed 2 3 umbrella sampling and free energy calculations in order to explicitly capture the dynamics binding processes of heavy metal cations with the deprotonated carboxyl group of nom in solution and quantitatively evaluate the thermodynamics in such processes we used umbrella sampling method kästner 2011 torrie and valleau 1977 to obtain the free energy profiles by gradually steering each heavy metal cation transforming from a fully solvated state to a bidentate complexing configuration on coo site this method has been widely used in previous studies for example iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 computed the association free energies of ca2 mg2 and na with deprotonated carboxyl groups in an aqueous solution the umbrella sampling method introduces a biasing potential in the simulations to visit some regions or windows around a certain reaction coordinate and in this study the distance between c of carboxyl and heavy metal was used as reaction coordinate the spacing of the umbrella windows is determined according to the strength of the harmonic constant to ensure adequate sampling of all distances using k 1 5 105 kj mol 1nm 2 the umbrella windows ranging from 0 2 nm to 0 4 nm were simulated every 0 01 nm using k 3 5 104 kj mol 1nm 2 the windows from 0 42 nm to 0 90 nm were sampled at an interval of 0 02 nm for simulation of each window a sampling run of 2 ns was carried out the system used was a cubic box of 35 å that was consisted of one tnb anion one heavy metal cation and 1340 water molecules the excess negative charges were neutralized by na all the details of five umbrella sampling systems were provided in table s3 the configuration outputted from the previous window was used as the input configuration for next window until the end of the simulation the resulting free energy curve was generated using the weighted histogram analysis method wham kumar et al 1992 2 4 dft calculations and interaction region indicator iri a representative aggregate conformation consisted of two tnb molecules via hydrophobic interaction was taken from md simulations and then the binding energy of the two tnb molecules were calculated by dft calculations geometry optimizations were performed using the cp2k quickstep package hutter et al 2014 kuhne et al 2020 the bfgs broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 algorithm was employed for geometry optimizations in this code a hybrid gaussian and plane waves gpw basis sets scheme was applied for the implementation of dft lippert et al 1997 gth basis sets goedecker et al 1996 were used to calculate the interactions between core and valence states pbe functional perdew et al 1996 was applied for exchange correlation supplemented by grimme s d3 dispersion corrections grimme et al 2010 atom centered basis sets of dzvp vandevondele and hutter 2007 were employed for n h o c the plane wave cutoff was set to 400 ry to gain more insights into the interaction mechanism and visually recognize the regions where significant interactions have formed interaction region indicator iri lu and chen 2021 was employed to analyze different types of weak interactions in this way all regions involving notable interactions can be simultaneously graphically displayed more details of iri isosurface are provided in fig s2 the multiwfn 3 8 program lu and chen 2012 was used to localize and identify the iri and vmd visual molecular dynamics humphrey et al 1996 was utilized for visualization more details of the methodology are provided in property of statistics in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 local coordination geometry of nom metal aggregate 3 1 1 under neutral condition in order to accurately describe the structural characteristics of heavy metal cations complexing with nom the radial distribution function rdf and coordination number cn curves of cations with respect to different types of o atoms including oalcoholic ophenolic ocarboxyl and owater were analyzed and the results are shown in fig s3 6 the rdf curves of cation o show one clear peak for all of the five heavy metals indicating the direct binding with o atoms and the position of peak was related to the average bond length it is shown that cd2 pb2 zn2 and eu3 cations scarcely coordinate with phenolic or alcoholic hydroxyl groups in their first coordination and only ag has slight coordination with alcoholic groups i e 0 22 shown in fig s3 a consequently one can ensure that these hydroxyl groups have no significant impact on the coordination of heavy metal cations with nom and therefore hardly contribute to the immobilization of heavy metals in the inner sphere complexes heavy metal cations were mostly coordinated with deprotonated carboxyl groups and solvent water and therefore the distances between heavy metal cations and their different ligands would give an intuitive description of the average structures of cations coordination shell the first peaks of ag ocarboxyl cd ocarboxyl pb ocarboxyl zn ocarboxyl and eu ocarboxyl rdf curves are centered at 2 10 2 15 2 50 1 95 and 2 40 å respectively shown in fig s5 the maxima of the first ag owater cd owater pb owater zn owater and eu owater peaks are at 2 15 2 25 2 55 2 10 and 2 50 å respectively shown in fig s6 which correspond the average cation water ligand distances these distances imply that each cation is closer to the oxygen moiety of carboxyl than to its coordinated water because the deprotonated carboxyl group is negatively charged these data revealed that each ag cd2 pb2 zn2 and eu3 were averagely bonded to 2 08 2 10 2 40 0 16 and 2 58 carboxyl o atoms respectively this manifested that all of the cations can form stable inner sphere complexation with carboxyl groups under neutral ph condition except zn2 and this might be interpreted by the relatively steady hydration shell of zn2 according to previous experiments by extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectroscopy the derived cation carboxyl o distances are 2 24 2 28 å for cd2 du et al 2018 du et al 2017 qu et al 2021 2 46 2 61 å for pb2 chen et al 2020 tiemann et al 2002 1 95 2 08 å for zn2 ha et al 2010 li et al 2017 parmentier et al 2016 and 2 38 2 42 å for eu3 chen et al 2013 fan et al 2009 tan et al 2009 therefore our simulations results are in good agreement with these studies however it remains controversial whether zn2 can form inner sphere complexes with carboxyl groups in experimental studies some studies have found that zn2 cannot form inner sphere complexes with carboxyl groups manceau et al 2002 minkina et al 2014 but a few studies have suggested the opposite conclusion ha et al 2010 nevidomskaya et al 2014 these works at least indicate that the inner sphere complexation between carboxyl groups and zn2 is not easy to form compared to other cations that in our study which is consistent with our finding that only a small population of zn2 can form inner sphere complexes with the deprotonated carboxyl groups in the later subsection this observation will be explained in detail from the perspective of thermodynamics we summarized the position of rdf peaks and cn values in table 1 moreover for cations of the same valence state the smaller radii of divalent cations have rcd 1 09 å rpb 1 43 å and rzn 0 88 å the smaller coordination shells are formed e g the shorter complexing lengths 2 15 å for cd2 2 50 å for pb2 and 1 95 å for zn2 and less coordination numbers 2 10 for cd2 2 40 for pb2 and 0 16 for zn2 3 1 2 under acidic condition the coordination states of cations with respect to hydroxyl ligands under low ph condition are similar to that under neutral ph condition and therefore this is not discussed in this section according to the rdf and cn curves of heavy metal cations with respect to solvent water shown in fig s7 it can be found that the cn values of different cations with water were 5 34 for ag 5 92 for cd2 8 17 for pb2 5 87 for zn2 and 9 02 for eu3 the cation water cn values in bulk aqueous solution using same force field parameters are 6 0 for ag dubois et al 2004 5 99 6 13 for cd2 de araujo et al 2007 8 13 9 0 for pb2 de araujo et al 2007 6 0 for zn2 sakharov and lim 2005 and 8 0 9 0 for eu3 duvail and guilbaud 2011 this indicates that the functional groups of nom can hardly be associated to heavy metal cations and thus cations are almost fully coordinated with solvent water molecules in acidic solution environment the average distances between five different cations and their first shell solvent water under acidic conditions were almost the same as that in neutral condition see table 1 3 2 nom aggregation mechanism 3 2 1 under neutral conditions the interaction energies between cations and nom have been displayed in fig s8 the curves indicate that vdw interactions contribute little to the total interactions under neutral condition the electrostatic interactions between deprotonated carboxyl groups and cations are the dominant driving force for nom metal interactions under neutral ph condition that can be ascribed to their opposite charges simultaneously we taking nom cd2 system under neutral condition for example fig 2 displays the structural evolution of supramolecular aggregate at different simulation stages obtained from the trajectories these snapshots clearly show that with the movement of the whole system nom supramolecular colloidal particle is gradually assembling movie of the md trajectory showing the dynamic molecular clustering and aggregation process over time is provided as movie s1 in si to illustrate the distinct aggregation mechanisms of nom induced by different heavy metal cations under neutral condition the rdf of all the carboxyl c atoms with themselves are analyzed fig 3 one interesting finding is that all the rdf curves show an apparent peak that is peaked around 4 6 å which clearly indicates the formation of supramolecular aggregate of nom fragments for all of the five systems the accumulated cn values are around 1 0 implicating that on average each carboxyl group is connected to another carboxyl groups at a distance of 4 6 å the typical configurations corresponding to these peaks have been illustrated along with the curves in fig 3 to give a direct visual description of the local aggregation structures that are bridged by heavy metal cations ag is bonded to three carboxyl o atoms that belongs to three different carboxyl groups fig 3a that is the deprotonated carboxyl group cannot play as bidentate complexing sites for ag this is possibly due to the weak complexing ability of monovalent cations for cd2 it bridges two carboxyl groups via a binuclear tetradentate binding motif namely cd2 binds directly with four o atoms from two carboxyl groups fig 3b compared to cd2 pb2 is coordinated to more carboxyl o atoms i e six and therefore more nom molecules i e four due to the larger coordination shell fig 3c for zn2 it interacts indirectly with two carboxyl groups through outer sphere complexation fashion with one of its h2o ligands donating hydrogen bonds to each of the carboxyl groups thus leading to nom aggregation fig 3d this novel mechanism is different from the traditional bridging role of cations in the aggregation of nom and may also apply to other heavy metal cations that have tight hydration shell as that of zn2 such as ni2 cu2 and co2 for eu3 it is associated with two carboxyl groups by forming four eu o bonds in which each carboxyl group provides bidentate complexing ligand fig 3e as a result the aggregation and stabilization of nom can occur through different mechanisms direct or indirect cation bridging owing to the dissimilar fundamental chemical properties of these cations according to the ft ir spectra in the prior works the intensity of the coo changes after cations adsorption meaning that ag cd2 pb2 and eu3 cations are able to form inner sphere complexes with carboxyl groups and carboxyl groups play a significant role in the aggregation of nom adegboyega et al 2013 irani et al 2015 jia et al 2022 kong et al 2022 maleke et al 2019 ortiz ibarra et al 2007 tan et al 2019 xu et al 2022 furthermore deonarine et al 2011 found that the growth rates of charged zn s nom particles increased with increasing ionic strength of zn2 that is the aggregation size of the particles increased while the rates were observed to decrease with increasing molecular weight and aromatic content of the nom fractions while carboxylate and reduced sulfur content had little effect according to a dynamic light scattering dls study this finding may indirectly support that zn2 can promote nom aggregation 3 2 2 under acidic conditions the average numbers of hydrogen bonds between nom fragments in different systems are shown in fig 4 which clearly demonstrates that hydrophilic functional groups oh cooh coo mainly contributed to the formed hydrogen bonds notably under acidic condition the protonation of carboxyl groups leads to more hydrogen bonds compared to that under neutral condition this observation is in good agreement with the a recent study of galicia andrés et al 2021 additionally the number of hydrogen bonds formed in the presence of different cations did not differ significantly under both neutral and low ph conditions and compared to blank control the presence of heavy metal cations has little effect on the formed hydrogen bonds therefore the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the hydrophilic functional groups play a crucial role of in the aggregation of nom it can be inferred from the results of h bonding that the aggregation of nom under acidic condition should mainly result from the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions between specific nom fragments such as π π interactions by analyzing the md trajectories we observed the stacking of benzene rings from different nom fragments dft calculations help to directly characterize and reveal such weak interaction between two tnb molecules under acidic condition the optimized structure of such conformation is shown in fig 5 where the two benzene rings are 3 54 å apart from each other the estimated binding energy by quantum chemistry calculations is 19 1 kcal mol implying the hydrophobic interaction through this way is thermodynamically favorable the resulting iri analysis is also illustrated in fig 5 from that we can get a fast identification of the nature of interactions the isosurfaces indicate an obvious weak interaction region green region between the two benzene rings that confirmed π π interaction in conclusion the π π interactions also contribute to the aggregation of nom under acidic condition apart from hydrogen bonding interactions 3 3 surface hydrophilicity of nom solvent accessible surface area sasa is helpful to understand the surface properties and aggregation degree of nom at the molecular level for example if the hydrophilic area decreases it is indicative of the formation of larger supramolecular structure as indicated by the sasa profiles in fig s9 10 the hydrophilic areas under acidic condition decreased more significantly compared with neutral condition while the areas of hydrophobic region did not change considerably and therefore the hydrophilic areas contributed predominantly to total sasa the average values of sasa at neutral and acidic ph conditions are shown in the fig 6 for systems with different cations there is no obvious difference in the sasas of nom for systems containing each type of heavy metal cation under both ph conditions but for the case of blank control at neutral ph the sasa shows a noticeable increase implying that heavy metal cations effectively promote the aggregation of nom under neutral condition generally the hydrophilic areas in low ph environment are smaller than that under neutral ph condition indicating that as the formation of nom colloidal particle proceeds more hydrophilic functional groups are encapsulated inside the supramolecular structure of nom aggregate and more compact cluster is formed under acidic condition 3 4 diffusion properties the analyzed mean square displacement msd profiles for heavy metal cations in different systems coexistence with nom under neutral condition coexistence with nom under acidic condition and in bulk solution are displayed in fig 7 a b and fig s11 the fitted diffusion coefficients according to einstein s diffusion law einstein 1905 are summarized in table 2 in bulk aqueous solution the diffusion coefficients are 1 25 10 5 cm2 s for ag 0 77 10 5 cm2 s for cd2 0 84 10 5 cm2 s for pb2 0 70 10 5 cm2 s for zn2 and 0 50 10 5 cm2 s for eu3 the values obtained by experiments were 1 65 10 5 cm2 s for ag 0 72 10 5 cm2 s for cd2 0 95 10 5 cm2 s for pb2 0 70 10 5 cm2 s for zn2 and 0 59 10 5 cm2 s for eu3 haynes et al 2016 parkhurst 1995 it can be found that the diffusion coefficients achieved by our md simulations are in good agreement with experiments which further validates the reliability of our computational modeling the diffusion coefficients in acidic solution with nom were significantly greater than in neutral solution with the exception of zn2 and this is probably because the four types of cations formed inner sphere complexes with the deprotonated carboxyl groups of nom consequently the mobilities of heavy metal cations will be reduced considerably as ph increases these results coincided with prior research that suggested complexation by organic matters controls metal toxicity and transport from a molecular level perspective cabaniss 2008 hue et al 1986 3 5 adsorption free energy and binding mechanism potentials of mean force pmfs profiles for the association processes of the five metal cations with deprotonated carboxylic group of nom were given in fig 8 the pmf characterized the change in free energy due to the transformation of adsorption configurations from fully solvated state where the free energy was taken as the zero point at 7 to 9 å in reaction coordinate to inner sphere complexing via outer sphere complexing the values of special points in the curves related to minima and barriers are summarized in details in table 3 the overall binding free energies are 2 36 kcal mol for ag 8 04 kcal mol for cd2 3 86 kcal mol for pb2 21 05 kcal mol for zn2 and 10 46 kcal mol for eu3 the overall binding energy of zn2 is the lowest and therefore its bidentate adsorption strength with carboxyl group is the largest among in the five cations the radius of zn2 is significantly smaller than that of the other cations rag 1 08 å rcd 1 09 å rpb 1 43 å rzn 0 88 å and reu 1 21 å marcus 1994 so the complexation distance with carboxyl o atom is shorter 2 10 for ag 2 15 for cd2 2 50 for pb2 1 95 for zn2 and 2 40 for eu3 as the distance between heavy metal cations and carboxyl group decreased the association proceeded gradually through several stages there are three minimal points in each curve and two activation barriers between them taking the case for cd2 as an example fig 9 illustrates the structural transformation along with free energy change the detailed changes of adsorption configuration for other cations are displayed in fig s12 a d at 7 15 å cd2 is coordinated with six water molecules having an intact hydration shell and there is almost no attraction from carboxyl site at 4 60 å a solvent separated ion pair ssip between cd2 and carboxyl group was formed where cd2 was adsorbed as an outer sphere fashion by h bonding between the h of its water ligand and carboxyl o corresponding to a local minimum of 0 82 kcal mol as carboxyl c cd distance reduced to 3 92 å another local minimum occurs 3 99 kcal mol which is related to an inner sphere complexation configuration of monodentate contact ion pair mcip at this point cd2 formed a single complexing bond with carboxyl group and meantime had five water ligands at 2 64 å the global minimum of free energy occurs and the complexation geometry became to a bidentate contact ion pair bcip in which cd2 was bonded to the two o atoms of coo group and four coordinated water ligands according to the resulting free energies the strengths and thermodynamic stabilities of bcip should follow the order of zn2 eu3 cd2 pb2 ag simultaneously different energy barriers need to be overcome when transforming from outer sphere to inner sphere complexation which explain the probabilities of formation of inner sphere complexes one can see that the barrier from ssip to mcip for ag cd2 pb2 and eu3 are very close i e 2 4 2 9 kcal mol and such small barriers indicate the spontaneity of inner sphere adsorption while that for zn2 is significantly higher 6 19 kcal mol implying that it is relatively hard to form zn2 inner sphere complexation this is consistent with what we found in free md simulations that zn2 was rarely coordinated with carboxyl o similarly for the transformation of mcip to bcip the barrier for zn2 5 30 kcal mol is much larger than those for the other four types of cations 0 6 2 21 kcal mol these findings suggest that both minima and maxima in binding free energy landscape should be considered comprehensively when assessing the immobilization and retention effects of nom to heavy metal cations 3 6 environmental implications this study reveals that the complexation of heavy metal cations with nom affect the stabilization and aggregation of nom in two primary ways on one hand heavy metal cations can directly promote aggregation processes by bridging carboxylic groups of nom molecules effectively holding them together through reducing the net charge under neutral condition on the other hand under acidic environment hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic functional groups of nom is the dominant driving force to nom supramolecular aggregation in addition other weak interactions such as π π interaction also contribute to the formation of nom aggregate the chemistry e g ionic size coordination number hydration energy of heavy metal cations in aqueous solution leads to distinct cation bridging mechanisms of nom aggregation our modeling uncovered that zn2 can promote the aggregation phenomenon of nom through hydrogen bonding interaction between its water ligands with several deprotonated carboxyl groups owing to its greatly more inflexible hydration shell than cd2 and pb2 in the last decades the role of common cations such as ca2 mg2 and na in the aggregation and stabilization of nom have been extensively explored at molecular level and thermodynamically dudev and lim 2004 iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 kalinichev 2012 kalinichev and kirkpatrick 2007 according to kalinichev et al 2011 ca2 was coordinated with multiple deprotonated carboxylic groups easily owing to its relatively flexible hydration shell while mg2 cannot bind directly with nom by forming inner sphere complexes due to its much tighter hydration shell compared to ca2 accordingly it is reasonable to infer that cd2 and pb2 behave like ca2 in the aggregation process of nom while the bridging role of zn2 should resemble to mg2 given their similar complexing mechanisms with nom consequently it can be deduced that mg2 also indirectly conduce to the aggregation of nom via hydrogen bonding interactions with the deprotonated carboxylic groups of nom for instance yan et al 2015 investigated the interaction between mg2 and nom using differential absorbance spectroscopy das and the features in das appear to be a result of the carboxylic and phenolic sites in nom caused by the replacement of nom bound protons when mg2 interacting with nom this experimental observation may be consistent with our findings on the contrary the inner sphere complex formed by na and the carboxyl group is not strong so the aggregation of nom is not effectively promoted by na ahn et al 2008 bonn and fish 1993 iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 kalinichev and kirkpatrick 2007 sutton et al 2005 van den hoop et al 1990 the positions of carboxyl groups will affect their binding with cations due to the distinct local coordination environments e g the number and type of functional groups in their immediate vicinity the relative solvent exposure of the carboxyl binding site and so on adusei gyamfi et al 2019 dudev and lim 2004 the effect of different types of carboxyl groups on the binding strengths to metal cations will be further investigated in more detail in our future study 4 conclusion this study quantitatively revealed the aggregation and stabilization mechanisms of nom heavy metal associations at the molecular scale the following main conclusions have been drawn 1 in general the hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydrophilic functional groups and the vdw interactions between hydrophobic moieties are responsible for the aggregation of nom under low ph condition the electrostatic force and inner sphere complexation between deprotonated carboxyl groups and cations are dominantly responsible for the aggregation of nom under neutral condition 2 the dissimilar

14780,interaction between natural organic matters nom and heavy metal cations in aqueous environment are of great significance for maintaining stability of organic carbon and restraining transport of heavy metal contaminants in bio geochemical processes we systematically explore the aggregation process and complexation between nom and heavy metal cations ag cd2 pb2 zn2 eu3 under different ph condition by molecular dynamics md simulations umbrella sampling method and quantum chemistry calculations the character of molecular structures nom heavy metal complexes and association are quantified in acidic ph condition aggregation proceeds via h bonding and π π interactions between nom fragments in neutral condition ag cd2 pb2 and eu3 can form inner sphere complexes with the surface carboxylic groups and therefore reduce intermolecular charge repulsion eventually leading to nom aggregation and it shows that even without direct binding the outer sphere adsorbed zn2 can also result in the formation of nom assemble through h bonding consequently these heavy metals are capable of promoting nom aggregation regardless of the complexing ways complexing free energy calculations characterized the dynamic processes of cations binding to the carboxylic groups of nom fragment and the related energy landscape this study provides quantitative insights for understanding the environmental processes of heavy metals and cycle of c in aquatic ecosystem and contributes to developing environment friendly strategies for controlling heavy metal contaminants graphical abstract

introduction natural organic matter nom a heterogeneous and incompletely characterized supramolecular mixture with a variety of aliphatic and aromatic compounds and abundant surface functional groups is present ubiquitously in the environment and play a crucial role in global carbon cycle e g organic carbon reservation and sequestration kellerman et al 2015 świetlik and sikorska 2006 wu et al 2007 nom has been considered as both a source and sink for organic carbon which may have an indirect climatic effect delpla et al 2009 dore 2005 hruska et al 2009 in addition nom influences the concentrations of dissolved o n p and s and serve as a carrier of toxic pollutants like heavy metal cations santschi et al 2017 tipping 2002 heavy metal cations are usually released into the environment as a result of industrial activities such as battery manufacture mining and metallurgical fertilizer industries hajji et al 2019 knauer et al 2017 they can be transferred into the human and other life organisms via inhalation ingestion and skin adsorption causing irreversible disruptions potgieter et al 2006 metal nom interactions largely govern the speciation solubility transport and toxicity of trace metals in aqueous environment consequently it is essential to deeply elucidate the interaction processes between nom and heavy metal cations and the relevant molecular level mechanisms which is important for understanding the aggregation and stabilization of nom supramolecular structure and the environmental fate of heavy metals that are the major focus of aquatic environmental chemistry over years there have been numerous studies exploring the interaction between nom and heavy metal cations using traditional experimental methods for example yang et al 2015 sequentially extracted four humic acids ha fractions from a single sediment and conducted the sorption experiments of cu2 on these ha fractions their results showed that aromaticity and acidic group content of ha fraction decreased with increasing extraction and earlier extracted ha fraction had higher sorption capacity and affinity for cu2 bai et al 2018 illustrated that the different effects of ha molecular weight on cd2 binding were attributed to the functional group content carboxylic and phenolic groups and structural properties by fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem quenching the results of their study also showed that the ha with molecular weight below 5 kda uf1 could bind large amounts of cd2 but the binding affinity was lower than for uf4 30 kda nevertheless nom are structurally complex and heterogeneous with a large diversity in its composition and therefore it is hard to quantitatively clarify the complexation and aggregation mechanism with heavy metal cations at the molecular scale e g identification of active binding sites detailed microscopic complexing geometries observation of dynamic binding and aggregation processes and thermodynamics of reactions molecular dynamics md is a powerful computer simulation technique which is widely used in field of environmental science and aqueous chemistry gerzabek et al 2022 greathouse et al 2014 kunhi mouvenchery et al 2011 liu et al 2022 orsi 2014 by analyzing a range of physicochemical properties the structural thermodynamic and dynamical properties of substances can be revealed at molecular level md simulations have been proven as a beneficial supplement to traditional experimental studies with regard to the nom metal cations interactions ai et al 2020 devarajan et al 2020 galicia andrés et al 2021 iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 kalinichev et al 2011 kalinichev and kirkpatrick 2007 zhang et al 2020 for example galicia andrés et al 2021 performed md simulations to explain the influence of cations and hydrogen bonds in nom stabilization and the different cation nom complex structures and their distribution were explored moreover quantum chemistry calculations based on density functional theory dft can reveal the structural and electronic properties of complexing systems du et al 2022 qi et al 2022 wang et al 2021 in summary previous studies have confirmed that the solution ph and cation types greatly influence the aggregation process and supramolecular structure of nom in the presence of metal cations notably it remains an open question that how will the interactions between different types of heavy metal cations and nom affect the aggregation and stabilization behavior of nom which is key to understand the availability and transport of heavy metal cations in supergene environment as well as the aggregation and stabilization nom when coexisting with heavy metal contaminants even though the microscopic complexing structure of heavy metal cations adsorbed on nom functional groups has been proposed more or less in available literatures there is still a lack of quantitative free energy data that helps us understand the dynamic complexing processes and binding strengths from a thermodynamic perspective to accurately understand the binding mechanism of heavy metal cations on nom and the aggregation process of nom induced by different heavy metal cations the interfacial interaction between nom and heavy metal cations has been systematically investigated using md simulations and related free energy calculations technique in association with quantum chemistry calculations monovalent ag bivalent cd2 pb2 zn2 and trivalent eu3 cations were selected as model cations to reveal their interaction mechanism with nom under different ph conditions neutral and acidic conditions the derived time averaged statistical data qualitatively characterize the aggregation and stabilization mechanism of nom and the adsorption geometries on nom functional groups and elucidate kinetic and dynamics characteristics of heavy metal cations nom complexes association free energies of cation nom in solution calculated by umbrella sampling simulations fully reveal the quantitative binding mechanism our study provides novel insights for understanding the dynamic nom heavy metal interactions from the quantitative perspective with implications on the fate of heavy metal contaminants and stabilization of organic carbon in natural aqueous environment 2 methodology 2 1 models the temple northeastern birmingham tnb model shown in fig s1 in supporting information si is a classical nom model works because of the similarity of tnb composition to natural nom davies et al 1997 jansen et al 1996 kubicki and apitz 1999 sein et al 1998 the fragment of tnb is composed by three carboxylic group three carbonyl groups two phenolic groups two amine groups and four alcohol groups with a total chemical formula of c36h40o16n2 in fully protonated state in our simulations the protonation states of carboxyl groups were adjusted to predict the behavior of nom at different ph conditions neutral and acidic condition ritchie and perdue 2003 has shown that the carboxyl groups of tnb model have a pk a of 4 to 5 and therefore they can be deprotonated under neutral condition and remain protonated under acidic condition while the phenolic groups pk a 9 should be completely protonated under both conditions therefore the negative charges of nom in near neutral environment arise from the deprotonated carboxyl groups which are also the potential binding sites for heavy metal cations so far tnb models have been widely used in molecular simulations of the aqueous environmental processes of nom ai et al 2020 iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 kalinichev et al 2011 tan et al 2018 tan et al 2019 five types of heavy metal cations ag cd2 pb2 zn2 eu3 were studied to represent different valences and each cation was simulated in individual system with the concentration of 0 2 mol l taking cd2 systems as an example its initial configuration is shown in fig 1 in all of the simulated systems the excess negative or positive charges were neutralized by na and cl respectively as a result there were 10 individual simulation systems in total whose compositional details are listed in table s1 all of the simulation cells were repeated in three dimensions abiding by the periodic boundary conditions 2 2 md simulations md simulations were carried out by gromacs 2018 4 package abraham et al 2015 van der spoel et al 2005 total potential interaction energy included bonding and non bonding terms non bonded interactions included coulombic e coul i j i q i q j 4 π r i j ε 0 and van der waals terms e vdw i j i 4 ε ij σ ij r ij 12 σ ij r ij 6 the cross interaction was accounted for by ε ij and σ ij ε ij ε i ε j σ ij 1 2 σ i σ j qi and qj were the atomic charges of atom i and j respectively rij was the distance between atom i and atom j and ε0 was the vacuum dielectric constant frenkel et al 1997 cutoff for short range and long range interactions was 12 å the particle mesh ewald pme method essmann et al 1995 was employed for electrostatic energy in present study the nom model was parameterized by amber 03 force field duan et al 2003 the extended simple point charge spc e water model was used berendsen et al 1987 the parameters employed for ag cd2 pb2 zn2 eu3 cations were adopted from previous studies de araujo et al 2007 duvail and guilbaud 2011 ekhteiari salmas et al 2013 khanmohammadi et al 2019 vanommeslaeghe et al 2010 which are summarized in table s2 the structure optimization of tnb by dft calculations was conducted at the quantum chemistry level of def2 tzvp basis set weigend and ahlrichs 2005 and b3lyp functional becke 1993 lee et al 1988 by gaussian 16 m j frisch 2016 the partial atomic charges of tnb were derived on the basis of the restrained electrostatic potential resp christopher i bayly 1993 that were obtained by multifwn 3 8 program lu and chen 2012 the acquired resp atomic charges of tnb model were used in md simulations leap frog algorithm hockney et al 1974 was used for integration of motion equation berendsen barostat berendsen et al 1984 and velocity rescale thermostat bussi et al 2007 were used for each simulation the system was pre equilibrated for 0 5 ns in nvt constant number volume and temperature ensemble at 298 k and subsequently for 2 ns equilibration in npt constant number pressure and temperature ensemble at 1 atm and 298 k production run of 100 ns in nvt ensemble was performed 2 3 umbrella sampling and free energy calculations in order to explicitly capture the dynamics binding processes of heavy metal cations with the deprotonated carboxyl group of nom in solution and quantitatively evaluate the thermodynamics in such processes we used umbrella sampling method kästner 2011 torrie and valleau 1977 to obtain the free energy profiles by gradually steering each heavy metal cation transforming from a fully solvated state to a bidentate complexing configuration on coo site this method has been widely used in previous studies for example iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 computed the association free energies of ca2 mg2 and na with deprotonated carboxyl groups in an aqueous solution the umbrella sampling method introduces a biasing potential in the simulations to visit some regions or windows around a certain reaction coordinate and in this study the distance between c of carboxyl and heavy metal was used as reaction coordinate the spacing of the umbrella windows is determined according to the strength of the harmonic constant to ensure adequate sampling of all distances using k 1 5 105 kj mol 1nm 2 the umbrella windows ranging from 0 2 nm to 0 4 nm were simulated every 0 01 nm using k 3 5 104 kj mol 1nm 2 the windows from 0 42 nm to 0 90 nm were sampled at an interval of 0 02 nm for simulation of each window a sampling run of 2 ns was carried out the system used was a cubic box of 35 å that was consisted of one tnb anion one heavy metal cation and 1340 water molecules the excess negative charges were neutralized by na all the details of five umbrella sampling systems were provided in table s3 the configuration outputted from the previous window was used as the input configuration for next window until the end of the simulation the resulting free energy curve was generated using the weighted histogram analysis method wham kumar et al 1992 2 4 dft calculations and interaction region indicator iri a representative aggregate conformation consisted of two tnb molecules via hydrophobic interaction was taken from md simulations and then the binding energy of the two tnb molecules were calculated by dft calculations geometry optimizations were performed using the cp2k quickstep package hutter et al 2014 kuhne et al 2020 the bfgs broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno broyden 1970 fletcher 1970 goldfarb 1970 shanno 1970 algorithm was employed for geometry optimizations in this code a hybrid gaussian and plane waves gpw basis sets scheme was applied for the implementation of dft lippert et al 1997 gth basis sets goedecker et al 1996 were used to calculate the interactions between core and valence states pbe functional perdew et al 1996 was applied for exchange correlation supplemented by grimme s d3 dispersion corrections grimme et al 2010 atom centered basis sets of dzvp vandevondele and hutter 2007 were employed for n h o c the plane wave cutoff was set to 400 ry to gain more insights into the interaction mechanism and visually recognize the regions where significant interactions have formed interaction region indicator iri lu and chen 2021 was employed to analyze different types of weak interactions in this way all regions involving notable interactions can be simultaneously graphically displayed more details of iri isosurface are provided in fig s2 the multiwfn 3 8 program lu and chen 2012 was used to localize and identify the iri and vmd visual molecular dynamics humphrey et al 1996 was utilized for visualization more details of the methodology are provided in property of statistics in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 local coordination geometry of nom metal aggregate 3 1 1 under neutral condition in order to accurately describe the structural characteristics of heavy metal cations complexing with nom the radial distribution function rdf and coordination number cn curves of cations with respect to different types of o atoms including oalcoholic ophenolic ocarboxyl and owater were analyzed and the results are shown in fig s3 6 the rdf curves of cation o show one clear peak for all of the five heavy metals indicating the direct binding with o atoms and the position of peak was related to the average bond length it is shown that cd2 pb2 zn2 and eu3 cations scarcely coordinate with phenolic or alcoholic hydroxyl groups in their first coordination and only ag has slight coordination with alcoholic groups i e 0 22 shown in fig s3 a consequently one can ensure that these hydroxyl groups have no significant impact on the coordination of heavy metal cations with nom and therefore hardly contribute to the immobilization of heavy metals in the inner sphere complexes heavy metal cations were mostly coordinated with deprotonated carboxyl groups and solvent water and therefore the distances between heavy metal cations and their different ligands would give an intuitive description of the average structures of cations coordination shell the first peaks of ag ocarboxyl cd ocarboxyl pb ocarboxyl zn ocarboxyl and eu ocarboxyl rdf curves are centered at 2 10 2 15 2 50 1 95 and 2 40 å respectively shown in fig s5 the maxima of the first ag owater cd owater pb owater zn owater and eu owater peaks are at 2 15 2 25 2 55 2 10 and 2 50 å respectively shown in fig s6 which correspond the average cation water ligand distances these distances imply that each cation is closer to the oxygen moiety of carboxyl than to its coordinated water because the deprotonated carboxyl group is negatively charged these data revealed that each ag cd2 pb2 zn2 and eu3 were averagely bonded to 2 08 2 10 2 40 0 16 and 2 58 carboxyl o atoms respectively this manifested that all of the cations can form stable inner sphere complexation with carboxyl groups under neutral ph condition except zn2 and this might be interpreted by the relatively steady hydration shell of zn2 according to previous experiments by extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectroscopy the derived cation carboxyl o distances are 2 24 2 28 å for cd2 du et al 2018 du et al 2017 qu et al 2021 2 46 2 61 å for pb2 chen et al 2020 tiemann et al 2002 1 95 2 08 å for zn2 ha et al 2010 li et al 2017 parmentier et al 2016 and 2 38 2 42 å for eu3 chen et al 2013 fan et al 2009 tan et al 2009 therefore our simulations results are in good agreement with these studies however it remains controversial whether zn2 can form inner sphere complexes with carboxyl groups in experimental studies some studies have found that zn2 cannot form inner sphere complexes with carboxyl groups manceau et al 2002 minkina et al 2014 but a few studies have suggested the opposite conclusion ha et al 2010 nevidomskaya et al 2014 these works at least indicate that the inner sphere complexation between carboxyl groups and zn2 is not easy to form compared to other cations that in our study which is consistent with our finding that only a small population of zn2 can form inner sphere complexes with the deprotonated carboxyl groups in the later subsection this observation will be explained in detail from the perspective of thermodynamics we summarized the position of rdf peaks and cn values in table 1 moreover for cations of the same valence state the smaller radii of divalent cations have rcd 1 09 å rpb 1 43 å and rzn 0 88 å the smaller coordination shells are formed e g the shorter complexing lengths 2 15 å for cd2 2 50 å for pb2 and 1 95 å for zn2 and less coordination numbers 2 10 for cd2 2 40 for pb2 and 0 16 for zn2 3 1 2 under acidic condition the coordination states of cations with respect to hydroxyl ligands under low ph condition are similar to that under neutral ph condition and therefore this is not discussed in this section according to the rdf and cn curves of heavy metal cations with respect to solvent water shown in fig s7 it can be found that the cn values of different cations with water were 5 34 for ag 5 92 for cd2 8 17 for pb2 5 87 for zn2 and 9 02 for eu3 the cation water cn values in bulk aqueous solution using same force field parameters are 6 0 for ag dubois et al 2004 5 99 6 13 for cd2 de araujo et al 2007 8 13 9 0 for pb2 de araujo et al 2007 6 0 for zn2 sakharov and lim 2005 and 8 0 9 0 for eu3 duvail and guilbaud 2011 this indicates that the functional groups of nom can hardly be associated to heavy metal cations and thus cations are almost fully coordinated with solvent water molecules in acidic solution environment the average distances between five different cations and their first shell solvent water under acidic conditions were almost the same as that in neutral condition see table 1 3 2 nom aggregation mechanism 3 2 1 under neutral conditions the interaction energies between cations and nom have been displayed in fig s8 the curves indicate that vdw interactions contribute little to the total interactions under neutral condition the electrostatic interactions between deprotonated carboxyl groups and cations are the dominant driving force for nom metal interactions under neutral ph condition that can be ascribed to their opposite charges simultaneously we taking nom cd2 system under neutral condition for example fig 2 displays the structural evolution of supramolecular aggregate at different simulation stages obtained from the trajectories these snapshots clearly show that with the movement of the whole system nom supramolecular colloidal particle is gradually assembling movie of the md trajectory showing the dynamic molecular clustering and aggregation process over time is provided as movie s1 in si to illustrate the distinct aggregation mechanisms of nom induced by different heavy metal cations under neutral condition the rdf of all the carboxyl c atoms with themselves are analyzed fig 3 one interesting finding is that all the rdf curves show an apparent peak that is peaked around 4 6 å which clearly indicates the formation of supramolecular aggregate of nom fragments for all of the five systems the accumulated cn values are around 1 0 implicating that on average each carboxyl group is connected to another carboxyl groups at a distance of 4 6 å the typical configurations corresponding to these peaks have been illustrated along with the curves in fig 3 to give a direct visual description of the local aggregation structures that are bridged by heavy metal cations ag is bonded to three carboxyl o atoms that belongs to three different carboxyl groups fig 3a that is the deprotonated carboxyl group cannot play as bidentate complexing sites for ag this is possibly due to the weak complexing ability of monovalent cations for cd2 it bridges two carboxyl groups via a binuclear tetradentate binding motif namely cd2 binds directly with four o atoms from two carboxyl groups fig 3b compared to cd2 pb2 is coordinated to more carboxyl o atoms i e six and therefore more nom molecules i e four due to the larger coordination shell fig 3c for zn2 it interacts indirectly with two carboxyl groups through outer sphere complexation fashion with one of its h2o ligands donating hydrogen bonds to each of the carboxyl groups thus leading to nom aggregation fig 3d this novel mechanism is different from the traditional bridging role of cations in the aggregation of nom and may also apply to other heavy metal cations that have tight hydration shell as that of zn2 such as ni2 cu2 and co2 for eu3 it is associated with two carboxyl groups by forming four eu o bonds in which each carboxyl group provides bidentate complexing ligand fig 3e as a result the aggregation and stabilization of nom can occur through different mechanisms direct or indirect cation bridging owing to the dissimilar fundamental chemical properties of these cations according to the ft ir spectra in the prior works the intensity of the coo changes after cations adsorption meaning that ag cd2 pb2 and eu3 cations are able to form inner sphere complexes with carboxyl groups and carboxyl groups play a significant role in the aggregation of nom adegboyega et al 2013 irani et al 2015 jia et al 2022 kong et al 2022 maleke et al 2019 ortiz ibarra et al 2007 tan et al 2019 xu et al 2022 furthermore deonarine et al 2011 found that the growth rates of charged zn s nom particles increased with increasing ionic strength of zn2 that is the aggregation size of the particles increased while the rates were observed to decrease with increasing molecular weight and aromatic content of the nom fractions while carboxylate and reduced sulfur content had little effect according to a dynamic light scattering dls study this finding may indirectly support that zn2 can promote nom aggregation 3 2 2 under acidic conditions the average numbers of hydrogen bonds between nom fragments in different systems are shown in fig 4 which clearly demonstrates that hydrophilic functional groups oh cooh coo mainly contributed to the formed hydrogen bonds notably under acidic condition the protonation of carboxyl groups leads to more hydrogen bonds compared to that under neutral condition this observation is in good agreement with the a recent study of galicia andrés et al 2021 additionally the number of hydrogen bonds formed in the presence of different cations did not differ significantly under both neutral and low ph conditions and compared to blank control the presence of heavy metal cations has little effect on the formed hydrogen bonds therefore the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the hydrophilic functional groups play a crucial role of in the aggregation of nom it can be inferred from the results of h bonding that the aggregation of nom under acidic condition should mainly result from the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions between specific nom fragments such as π π interactions by analyzing the md trajectories we observed the stacking of benzene rings from different nom fragments dft calculations help to directly characterize and reveal such weak interaction between two tnb molecules under acidic condition the optimized structure of such conformation is shown in fig 5 where the two benzene rings are 3 54 å apart from each other the estimated binding energy by quantum chemistry calculations is 19 1 kcal mol implying the hydrophobic interaction through this way is thermodynamically favorable the resulting iri analysis is also illustrated in fig 5 from that we can get a fast identification of the nature of interactions the isosurfaces indicate an obvious weak interaction region green region between the two benzene rings that confirmed π π interaction in conclusion the π π interactions also contribute to the aggregation of nom under acidic condition apart from hydrogen bonding interactions 3 3 surface hydrophilicity of nom solvent accessible surface area sasa is helpful to understand the surface properties and aggregation degree of nom at the molecular level for example if the hydrophilic area decreases it is indicative of the formation of larger supramolecular structure as indicated by the sasa profiles in fig s9 10 the hydrophilic areas under acidic condition decreased more significantly compared with neutral condition while the areas of hydrophobic region did not change considerably and therefore the hydrophilic areas contributed predominantly to total sasa the average values of sasa at neutral and acidic ph conditions are shown in the fig 6 for systems with different cations there is no obvious difference in the sasas of nom for systems containing each type of heavy metal cation under both ph conditions but for the case of blank control at neutral ph the sasa shows a noticeable increase implying that heavy metal cations effectively promote the aggregation of nom under neutral condition generally the hydrophilic areas in low ph environment are smaller than that under neutral ph condition indicating that as the formation of nom colloidal particle proceeds more hydrophilic functional groups are encapsulated inside the supramolecular structure of nom aggregate and more compact cluster is formed under acidic condition 3 4 diffusion properties the analyzed mean square displacement msd profiles for heavy metal cations in different systems coexistence with nom under neutral condition coexistence with nom under acidic condition and in bulk solution are displayed in fig 7 a b and fig s11 the fitted diffusion coefficients according to einstein s diffusion law einstein 1905 are summarized in table 2 in bulk aqueous solution the diffusion coefficients are 1 25 10 5 cm2 s for ag 0 77 10 5 cm2 s for cd2 0 84 10 5 cm2 s for pb2 0 70 10 5 cm2 s for zn2 and 0 50 10 5 cm2 s for eu3 the values obtained by experiments were 1 65 10 5 cm2 s for ag 0 72 10 5 cm2 s for cd2 0 95 10 5 cm2 s for pb2 0 70 10 5 cm2 s for zn2 and 0 59 10 5 cm2 s for eu3 haynes et al 2016 parkhurst 1995 it can be found that the diffusion coefficients achieved by our md simulations are in good agreement with experiments which further validates the reliability of our computational modeling the diffusion coefficients in acidic solution with nom were significantly greater than in neutral solution with the exception of zn2 and this is probably because the four types of cations formed inner sphere complexes with the deprotonated carboxyl groups of nom consequently the mobilities of heavy metal cations will be reduced considerably as ph increases these results coincided with prior research that suggested complexation by organic matters controls metal toxicity and transport from a molecular level perspective cabaniss 2008 hue et al 1986 3 5 adsorption free energy and binding mechanism potentials of mean force pmfs profiles for the association processes of the five metal cations with deprotonated carboxylic group of nom were given in fig 8 the pmf characterized the change in free energy due to the transformation of adsorption configurations from fully solvated state where the free energy was taken as the zero point at 7 to 9 å in reaction coordinate to inner sphere complexing via outer sphere complexing the values of special points in the curves related to minima and barriers are summarized in details in table 3 the overall binding free energies are 2 36 kcal mol for ag 8 04 kcal mol for cd2 3 86 kcal mol for pb2 21 05 kcal mol for zn2 and 10 46 kcal mol for eu3 the overall binding energy of zn2 is the lowest and therefore its bidentate adsorption strength with carboxyl group is the largest among in the five cations the radius of zn2 is significantly smaller than that of the other cations rag 1 08 å rcd 1 09 å rpb 1 43 å rzn 0 88 å and reu 1 21 å marcus 1994 so the complexation distance with carboxyl o atom is shorter 2 10 for ag 2 15 for cd2 2 50 for pb2 1 95 for zn2 and 2 40 for eu3 as the distance between heavy metal cations and carboxyl group decreased the association proceeded gradually through several stages there are three minimal points in each curve and two activation barriers between them taking the case for cd2 as an example fig 9 illustrates the structural transformation along with free energy change the detailed changes of adsorption configuration for other cations are displayed in fig s12 a d at 7 15 å cd2 is coordinated with six water molecules having an intact hydration shell and there is almost no attraction from carboxyl site at 4 60 å a solvent separated ion pair ssip between cd2 and carboxyl group was formed where cd2 was adsorbed as an outer sphere fashion by h bonding between the h of its water ligand and carboxyl o corresponding to a local minimum of 0 82 kcal mol as carboxyl c cd distance reduced to 3 92 å another local minimum occurs 3 99 kcal mol which is related to an inner sphere complexation configuration of monodentate contact ion pair mcip at this point cd2 formed a single complexing bond with carboxyl group and meantime had five water ligands at 2 64 å the global minimum of free energy occurs and the complexation geometry became to a bidentate contact ion pair bcip in which cd2 was bonded to the two o atoms of coo group and four coordinated water ligands according to the resulting free energies the strengths and thermodynamic stabilities of bcip should follow the order of zn2 eu3 cd2 pb2 ag simultaneously different energy barriers need to be overcome when transforming from outer sphere to inner sphere complexation which explain the probabilities of formation of inner sphere complexes one can see that the barrier from ssip to mcip for ag cd2 pb2 and eu3 are very close i e 2 4 2 9 kcal mol and such small barriers indicate the spontaneity of inner sphere adsorption while that for zn2 is significantly higher 6 19 kcal mol implying that it is relatively hard to form zn2 inner sphere complexation this is consistent with what we found in free md simulations that zn2 was rarely coordinated with carboxyl o similarly for the transformation of mcip to bcip the barrier for zn2 5 30 kcal mol is much larger than those for the other four types of cations 0 6 2 21 kcal mol these findings suggest that both minima and maxima in binding free energy landscape should be considered comprehensively when assessing the immobilization and retention effects of nom to heavy metal cations 3 6 environmental implications this study reveals that the complexation of heavy metal cations with nom affect the stabilization and aggregation of nom in two primary ways on one hand heavy metal cations can directly promote aggregation processes by bridging carboxylic groups of nom molecules effectively holding them together through reducing the net charge under neutral condition on the other hand under acidic environment hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic functional groups of nom is the dominant driving force to nom supramolecular aggregation in addition other weak interactions such as π π interaction also contribute to the formation of nom aggregate the chemistry e g ionic size coordination number hydration energy of heavy metal cations in aqueous solution leads to distinct cation bridging mechanisms of nom aggregation our modeling uncovered that zn2 can promote the aggregation phenomenon of nom through hydrogen bonding interaction between its water ligands with several deprotonated carboxyl groups owing to its greatly more inflexible hydration shell than cd2 and pb2 in the last decades the role of common cations such as ca2 mg2 and na in the aggregation and stabilization of nom have been extensively explored at molecular level and thermodynamically dudev and lim 2004 iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 kalinichev 2012 kalinichev and kirkpatrick 2007 according to kalinichev et al 2011 ca2 was coordinated with multiple deprotonated carboxylic groups easily owing to its relatively flexible hydration shell while mg2 cannot bind directly with nom by forming inner sphere complexes due to its much tighter hydration shell compared to ca2 accordingly it is reasonable to infer that cd2 and pb2 behave like ca2 in the aggregation process of nom while the bridging role of zn2 should resemble to mg2 given their similar complexing mechanisms with nom consequently it can be deduced that mg2 also indirectly conduce to the aggregation of nom via hydrogen bonding interactions with the deprotonated carboxylic groups of nom for instance yan et al 2015 investigated the interaction between mg2 and nom using differential absorbance spectroscopy das and the features in das appear to be a result of the carboxylic and phenolic sites in nom caused by the replacement of nom bound protons when mg2 interacting with nom this experimental observation may be consistent with our findings on the contrary the inner sphere complex formed by na and the carboxyl group is not strong so the aggregation of nom is not effectively promoted by na ahn et al 2008 bonn and fish 1993 iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 kalinichev and kirkpatrick 2007 sutton et al 2005 van den hoop et al 1990 the positions of carboxyl groups will affect their binding with cations due to the distinct local coordination environments e g the number and type of functional groups in their immediate vicinity the relative solvent exposure of the carboxyl binding site and so on adusei gyamfi et al 2019 dudev and lim 2004 the effect of different types of carboxyl groups on the binding strengths to metal cations will be further investigated in more detail in our future study 4 conclusion this study quantitatively revealed the aggregation and stabilization mechanisms of nom heavy metal associations at the molecular scale the following main conclusions have been drawn 1 in general the hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydrophilic functional groups and the vdw interactions between hydrophobic moieties are responsible for the aggregation of nom under low ph condition the electrostatic force and inner sphere complexation between deprotonated carboxyl groups and cations are dominantly responsible for the aggregation of nom under neutral condition 2 the dissimilar fundamental chemical nature e g ionic size coordination number hydration energy of heavy metal cations in aqueous solution determine the distinct mechanisms direct or indirect cation bridging of nom aggregation and stabilization compared with ag cd2 pb2 and eu3 that can directly form inner sphere complexes with several deprotonated carboxyl groups zn2 promotes nom supramolecular aggregation through hydrogen bonding interaction between its coordinated h2o with deprotonated carboxyl groups 3 the mobilities for cations in acidic environment are much greater than in neutral solution with the exception of zn2 which is probably the inflexible hydration shell makes it hard to form inner sphere complexes with the deprotonated carboxyl groups of nom 4 the dynamic binding processes of heavy metal cations to the deprotonated carboxylic group are disclosed and adsorption free energy profiles are characterized according to umbrella sampling simulations which interpret the different complexing behaviors of heavy metals from a thermodynamically view declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction selenium has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its physiological duality with trace amount selenium exhibits essential benefit for nutritional demand on the contrary excessive selenium incurs toxic effects on human health to fulfill the basic nutrition needs 40 μg day intake of selenium is required while the adverse impact appears with more than 400 μg day selenium intake navarro alarcon and cabrera vique 2008 world health organization who has published guideline for drinking water i e 40 μg l zhu et al 2017 nancharaiah et al 2018 however selenium with high concentration of 6000 μg l and 9000 μg l were detected in aquifers in utah and colorado the usa respectively ji and wang 2017 therefore more efforts are needed to diminish the risks imposed by selenium in drinking water source tetravalent selenium se iv and hexavalent selenium se vi are regarded as the predominant existing forms in aqueous media and se iv exhibits greater toxicity than se vi latorre et al 2013 due to less toxicity and lower mobility of elemental selenium se 0 reduction of soluble se vi and se iv to se 0 is regarded as an effective pathway for selenium detoxification which can be achieved through biological and abiotic process fu et al 2014 qiao et al 2018 se vi can be removed abiotically through ion exchange adsorption or chemical reduction nishimura 2007 santos et al 2015 yoon et al 2011 however conventional methods incur high operation cost and produce secondary pollutants leading to impracticality for real application biological removal of se vi is a favorable technology attributed primarily to its cost effectiveness either heterotrophic or autotrophic process is employed for the bioreduction of se vi ontiveros valencia et al 2016 with emphasis on exploring the optimal electron donors organic matter is commonly used for electron donors in heterotrophic se vi reduction however it may generate excessive amount of biomass and thereby clogging the aquifer lenz et al 2009 he et al 2020 in comparison autotrophic process provides an alternative approach for the se vi transformation without external organic addition liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 hydrogen and methane are gaseous electron donors in autotrophic system responsible for bio conversation of se vi lai et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 apparently the safe usage and storage of such gaseous donors have become an issue hu et al 2022 resulting in extra precaution measures inorganic solid electron donors such as fe 0 and s 0 have been used for autotrophic bioreduction of heavy metals but both materials require costly manufacture process restricting the extensive use in environmental application zhang et al 2018 yelton et al 2013 natural fe ii bearing materials suits greatly to se vi biotransformation in real application as one of the most abundant and widely distributed iron sulfur minerals in natural geological matrix pyrrhotite is effectively used in the removal of as iii and no3 n li et al 2021b the low investment and easy regeneration of pyrrhotite make it more suitable to application of in situ remediation to date few studies have reported that utilizing pyrrhotite to bio reduce se vi and little is known about the relative contribution of biotic and abiotic process for se vi removal with mechanistic insight in this work the bioprocess of autotrophic microbial se vi reduction driven by pyrrhotite was investigated under anaerobic condition in simulated aquifer column study under varied influence factors were conducted to explore the change in performance of se vi bioreduction characterization of the produced precipitates and analysis of microbiology were also performed the main objectives are 1 to understand the feasibility and performance of se vi bioreduction supported by pyrrhotite 2 to determine the final product and reveal the microbial community evolution and functional genes 3 to propose the mechanistic pathway of bioreduction process this study provides new insights into the biodetoxification of se vi with pyrrhotite as a natural electron donor in aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch experiment plexiglass bottles with the volume of 250 ml were employed as batch reactors which was then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp caps to maintain strict anaerobic condition the biotic reactor contained 5 g natural pyrrhotite haoyu company guangdong china 50 ml aquifer sediment collected from a smelting site in panzhihua china as the inoculum this sediment with cell dry weight of 6 7 mg g sediment had been used in previous studies zhang et al 2019b li et al 2021a 200 ml synthetic groundwater flushed with nitrogen gas for 30 min to remove oxygen containing bicarbonate as the inorganic carbon source was also supplemented se vi was added in the form of na2seo4 with initial concentration of 10 mg l the bioreactors were incubated for two months before data collection the endogenous and sterilized groups consisted of only 50 ml fresh and sterilized 20 min at 121 c aquifer sediment respectively the abiotic group contained only 5 g natural pyrrhotite synthetic groundwater with the same amount and component as the biotic group was also provided for the three controls additionally pure thiobacillus denitrificans t denitrificans bacillus subtilis b subtilis and pseudomonas stutzeri p stutzeri representing the functional genera were employed in batch trials lu et al 2023 the initial od600 for all biotic groups was 1 0 all treatments of autotrophic t denitrificans were built with the same condition as the above ones while representative volatile fatty acids vfas instead of pyrrhotite were used for heterotrophic b subtilis and p stutzeri all experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 2 c in triplicates 2 2 column experiment and breakthrough study a cylindrical plexiglass column with 25 cm height and 5 cm diameter was used for continuous flow bioreactor the reactor was packed with 50 ml aquifer sediment and 200 g pyrrhotite and covered by aluminum foil to prevent light exposure quartz sand was used to fill the remaining column space all fillings were thoroughly mixed synthetic groundwater was continuously up flowed into the reactor at a prescribed flow rate through a peristaltic pump bt100 1 l longer uk na2seo4 was employed as the source of se vi of designated concentrations the column experiment lasted consecutive 258 d which was divided into five stages to investigate the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical influence on pyrrhotite driven se vi removal table 1 the effluent samples were daily collected and analyzed biomass samples were examined at each stage for microbial community analysis the generated precipitates functional genes and intermediate metabolites were also measured all experiments were carried out at room temperature 22 2 c additional two cylindrical columns of 25 cm height and 5 cm diameter were employed to conduct the breakthrough study of se vi removal four sampling ports were located at 5 10 15 20 cm from the bottom of each reactor one reactor was packed with the same additives as the column experiment i e biotic column while the other one contained no inoculum i e abiotic column 1 pv pore volume of column flushing was completed within 2 h according to which pump rate was adjusted liquid samples were taken from the effluent to monitor the fluctuation of se vi concentration 2 3 analytical methods all aqueous samples were filtered immediately through a 0 22 μm filter membrane after collection then centrifuged at 12 580 g for 20 min to remove se 0 and the suspended microbial cells before analysis ph orp and conductivity were measured by a multiparameter water quality meter sevenexcellences400 mettler toledo switzerland total se concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms x series thermo fisher germany spectrophotometric method uv2300 shanghai china was employed to analyze se iv concentration according to previous study li et al 2014 jain et al 2015 and se vi was detected after being reduced to se iv by hydrochloric acid brimmer et al 1987 xie et al 2017 no3 n nitrite no2 n and ammonium nh4 n concentrations were also measured utilizing spectrophotometry shi et al 2020 analysis of sulfate so4 2 sulfite so3 2 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 concentrations were achieved by ion chromatography basic ic 792 metrohm switzerland scanning electron microscope sem jeol jax 840 hitachi japan equipped with

otus were clustered from sequences with a 0 03 distance limit equivalent to 97 similarity wang et al 2021 relative gene abundances were expressed in the form of trans per million tpm lu et al 2023 the obtained data were processed with reported methods jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2022a functional genes possibly involved in se vi reduction sera napa and srdbac se iv reduction nirs and psra s ii

s1 supporting information cytochrome c cyt c on cell surfaces and intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh were also monitored and normalized to volatile suspended solids vss according to previously documented procedure zhang et al 2019a shi et al 2020 intermediate metabolites were examined to better elaborate the mechanism a gas chromatograph agilent 4890 j w scientific usa equipped with a flame ionization detector was utilized to determine vfas zhang et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 se vi removal in the batch bioreactors the performance of se vi reduction in three typical continuous cycles were showed in fig 1 a se vi was progressively removed with time in biotic group confirming the feasibility of se vi reduction by nature pyrrhotite se vi removal efficiency in a typical cycle 72 h was 98 6 1 18 corresponding to se vi removal rate of 1 16 0 04 mg l h the pseudo first order reaction kinetics process of the biotic group was 0 0552 d 1 r2 0 97 fig 1b this effectiveness of se vi reduction could be attributed to the reduced fe ii with high reactivity in the pyrrhotite grabb et al 2017 in addition s ii structure in pyrrhotite may contribute to the bioreduction process according to the previous reports bérenguer et al 2019 hu et al 2020 a decrease in effluent se vi concentration was initially observed in all control groups fig s1 supporting information at the end of the first cycle the removal efficiency of se vi in endogenous sterilized and abiotic groups reached 42 7 0 44 46 9 0 61 and 68 8 1 82 respectively which might be ascribed to the microbial endogenous metabolism adsorption and direct reduction by pyrrhotite respectively however se vi reduction gradually diminished as pyrrhotite was progressively passivated due to the formation of fe iii oxide on the surface causing hindrance to the electron transfer process mullet et al 2004 microbial activities could attenuate the passivation through dissolving the precipitates partially zhong et al 2017 both electron donor and microorganisms are essential to the bioreduction of se vi the above findings demonstrated the promising results of using pyrrhotite as an electron donor to bioreduce and biodetoxify se vi effectively 3 2 long term se vi removal efficient se vi elimination was observed in the column trial during 258 d operation fig 1c in the pyrrhotite packed biological column in stage 1 day 0 94 se vi was completely removed with initial concentration of 10 mg l se vi and 0 56 ml min constant flow rate while se vi removal capacity was 41 8 1 59 g m3 d table 1 no accumulation of intermediate se iv was observed during this phase however se vi removal efficiency rapidly decreased to 87 1 2 71 with elevated se vi concentration 50 mg l in stage 2 day 95 135 accompanied by an increase in se vi removal capacity to 172 8 16 4 g m3 d table 1 se vi removal efficiency decreased to 71 6 3 3 and removal capacity raised to 285 7 20 9 g m3 d when the initial concentration of se vi was further increased to 100 mg l during stage 3 day 136 176 indicating the gradual adaptation of functional microorganisms to high se vi loading condition notably accumulation of se iv was monitored however it dissipated quickly at the end of stage 3 the above pattern was also observed in previous reports li et al 2022 se vi removal efficiency was recovered to 92 3 2 37 when flow rate and se vi concentration were adjusted to 1 68 ml min and 10 mg l respectively with decline in removal capacity to 105 0 21 9 g m3 d in stage 4 day 177 217 in stage 5 day 218 258 10 mg l no3 n was introduced as widely distributed co existing pollutant with se vi in groundwater neupane et al 2020 with other operation condition identical to stage 1 removal efficiency and removal capacity of se vi decreased to 83 7 3 89 and 34 3 1 5 g m3 d respectively while 97 9 0 84 of no3 n was removed implying that no3 n was the preferred electron acceptor utilized by the microbial metabolism consisting with the previous report he et al 2021 similar pattern was observed by other researchers where se vi bioreduction was suppressed by no3 n when both co existed at equal levels owning to difference in physiological natures of no3 n and se vi reductases oremland et al 1999 lucas and hollibaugh 2001 3 3 determination of biotic and abiotic contributions fig 2 a showed se vi breakthrough curves for different reactor groups se vi removal reached complete breakthrough i e c c0 1 at 134 pv and 32 pv in biotic and abiotic column respectively migration rate of 0 58 0 03 cm pv in the se vi front was obtained in biotic column while a more rapid migration of 2 53 0 17 cm pv for se vi was attained in abiotic column fig 2b in the biotic column with pyrrhotite se vi was removed biotically and abiotically the reaction sites of pyrrhotite could be re generated through microbial activities such as secretion of acidic metabolites and or reduction of the fe iii produced gan et al 2018 which extended the reaction time between se vi and pyrrhotite resulting in prolonged lifetime of the column in the abiotic column structural fe ii in pyrrhotite reduced se vi abiotically however the passivation produced by iron oxides decreased the activity of mineral leading to the restriction of se vi removal based on above result the biotic and abiotic contributions to se vi removal were 81 4 1 07 and 18 6 1 39 respectively furthermore despite of the rapid breakthrough occurred in 5 cm port 5 cm from the inlet the breakthrough time extended from 70 pv to 134 pv when the column height changed from 10 cm to 25 cm suggesting that the lifetime of the column had prolonged when the column height increased rout et al 2017 similar behavior was also observed in abiotic column fig s2 supporting information 3 4 characterization of reaction products the biological column turned dark red at the end of the operation fig 3 a suggesting the generation of se 0 as result of se vi bioreduction yang et al 2016 fig 3b showed that se vi and se iv existed in the effluent with other forms of se such as se 0 unaccounted dissolved selenium and organic selenium tan et al 2018 xia et al 2019 li et al 2022 morphological characterization was implemented to further confirm the generation of metal precipitate sem image showed the presence of spheroids on the surface of the precipitate fig 3c the presence of se 0 in precipitate was also verified by the eds spectrum fig s3a supporting information xrd patterns exhibited the characteristic peaks corresponded to feo oh fig 3d chmielewská et al 2017 possibly derived from pyrrhotite oxidation meanwhile the se 3d xps spectrum of precipitates in fig 3e displayed characteristic peaks at 56 8 ev and 55 9 ev which was attributed to se 0 gonzalez gil et al 2016 zhang et al 2020b all above results indicated that solid se 0 was the major product from se vi bioreduction soluble fe species was not detectable in the effluent during the whole operation however fe was displayed as elemental component in the eds plot fig s3a supporting information xps spectra in 712 5 ev and 726 ev peak signal demonstrated the presence of fe fig 3f tang et al 2016 suggesting the oxidation of fe ii in pyrrhotite to fe iii which may adsorb se vi to form weakly bounded metal complex ziemkiewicz et al 2011 tan et al 2016 however the adsorption of fe iii to se vi was more likely occurred in acidic conditions in this study ph value has remained above 7 fig s3b supporting information which unlikely facilitated the adsorption of se vi with pyrrhotite conversion products highlighting the contribution of biological process ziemkiewicz et al 2011 tan et al 2016 the accumulation of so4 2 and trace of so3 2 were also observed in the effluent fig 1c fig s3c supporting information which might be originated from s ii oxidation in pyrrhotite s2o3 2 was undetectable throughout the process the peak of s 2p xps spectrum at 163 5 ev was related to s 0 fig 3f mullet et al 2004 which might be the product of incomplete oxidation of s ii in pyrrhotite serving as electron donor to bioreduce se vi li et al 2022 concentrations of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were below the detection limit suggesting the realization of complete denitrification process fig s3d supporting information zhang et al 2015 han et al 2020 1 3 seo 4 2 2 fes 4 h 2 o 3 s e 0 2 f e 3 2 so 4 2 8 o h 2 9 no 3 5 fes 7 h 2 o 5 f e 3 5 so 4 2 4 5 n 2 14 o h the stoichiometrical relationships between oxidants and reductant were calculated in stage 4 0 44 0 09 mmol se vi was removed daily which would produce 0 29 0 02 mmol so4 2 theoretically according to eq 1 in fact accumulation of 0 84 0 05 mmol so4 2 was observed based on eq 1 and eq 2 0 14 0 02 mmol se vi and 0 34 0 01 mmol no3 were removed daily in stage 5 leading to theoretical production of 0 28 0 06 mmol so4 2 actually 0 62 0 12 mmol so4 2 was detected these results suggested the over consumption of pyrrhotite besides se vi and no3 n reduction other bioactivities such as biomass growth and metabolism might consumed electrons released from pyrrhotite oxidation lu et al 2020 3 5 microbial community evolution the evolution of microbial communities at class level was showed in fig 4 a gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria were enriched in all stages with higher relative abundance in the treatment process than that in the inoculum except for stage 1 3 94 anaerolineae prevailed in stage 2 5 4 26 20 0 actinobacteria increased to 20 5 in stage 2 compared to 2 02 in the inoculum fig 4b demonstrated the significant changes in microbial community structure at the genus level compared to the inoculum 3 05 thiobacillus became the dominant genus with relative abundance of 43 0 and 36 9 in stage 2 and stage 3 respectively followed by decline in stage 4 and stage 5 with relative abundance of 20 0 and 15 0 respectively as a chemoautotrophic genus thiobacillus can oxidize the substrate to release electrons and synthesize metabolites as previous study showed where thiobacillus was enriched in s 0 based system to bioreduce se vi li et al 2022 species belong to thiobacillus were able to oxidize fe ii to fe iii s ii to so4 2 and s 0 ma et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 therefore thiobacillus showed ability to mediate the process where se vi reduction was coupled to the oxidation of fe ii and s ii pure t denitrificans could efficiently reduce se vi with pyrrhotite as electron donor fig 5 a with the synthesis of vfas and accumulation of trace se iv fig 5b these results proved the critical role of thiobacillus in coupling of pyrrhotite oxidation and se vi reduction the relative abundance of longilinea had significantly increased to 16 4 in stage 3 longilinea was a strict anaerobe which can generate volatile fatty acids through fermenting carbohydrates yamada et al 2007 ma et al 2015 researchers reported that longilinea has ability to resist toxic and can reduce as v das et al 2016 brevundimonas and rhodococcus were enriched with abundance in the range of 0 19 10 0 and 0 12 13 7 in all bioreactor stages respectively indicating their survivability under various ranges of stress imposed by se vi rhodococcus was detected in se vi bioreduction process lai et al 2020 which has diverse metabolic potential to adapt various types of niche leblanc et al 2008 cappelletti et al 2016 the relative abundance of denitratisoma varied throughout stage 1 5 especially in stage 3 with greater relative abundance of 6 69 denitratisoma was typical denitrifying bacteria participating the denitrifying process and capable of utilizing clo4 as electron accepter wang et al 2019 2022b zhang et al 2022 bacillus and pseudomonas were also observed during the experiment some species in these two genera showed the capacity to reduce se vi and se iv zhang and frankenberger 2007 hunter et al 2011 mishra et al 2011 subedi et al 2017 in addition pure culture tests indicated that b subtilis and p stutzeri could reduce se vi effectively by utilizing diverse vfas fig 3c d acetate supported the quickest se vi removal for both strains these phenomena further confirmed the contributions of bacillus and pseudomonas to se vi reduction in the constructed biosystem 3 6 functional genes and metabolic metabolites metagenomic analysis indicated the dynamics of functional genes related to selenate selenite sulfur and iron metabolisms during the operation fig 6 a the sera gene was significantly enriched in simulated bioreactor despite its absence in the inoculum this result was also confirmed by qpcr analysis fig 6b this gene encoded se vi reductase which was located in the periplasmic space wen et al 2016 previous study also showed that sera enzyme a trimeric molybdoenzyme was the main subunit for the selenate reductase from thauera selenatis that could catalyzes the reduction of se vi to se iv schröder et al 1997 the increasing abundance implied that sera was the functional genes committed to se vi bioreduction another two se vi reductase genes i e napa and srdbac demoll decker and macy 1993 kuroda et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 were upregulated in the removal process as indicated by qpcr result indicating their contribution to the bioreduction of se vi to se iv metagenomics and qpcr outputs indicated nirs and psra genes appeared abundantly in bioreactors fig 6a b these two genes could mediate reduction of se iv to se 0 sabaty et al 2001 burns et al 2009 the s ii oxidation gene soxb was greatly enriched in bioreactor which could promote the oxidation of s ii in pyrrhotite even though it was not detectable in the inoculum lu et al 2019 sun et al 2020 the gene mtra was involved in fe ii oxidation liu et al 2012 which was significantly upregulated with metagenomic and qpcr evidences fig 6a b the upregulated mtrc and omcb genes could mediate fe ii oxidation trough electron transfer shi et al 2016 the contents of electron transporters such as nadh and cyt c were significantly higher in bioreactor than that in the inoculum implying their contribution to se vi bioreduction through regulating the electron transfer fig 6c vfas acted as intermediates in microbial metabolisms was also detected with average concentration of 12 0 1 36 mg l of which acetate accounted for the main fraction the intermediates might be synthesized by autotrophs utilizing either carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as the sole carbon source during bioreduction with energy harnessed from pyrrhotite oxidation estelmann et al 2011 zhang et al 2020a previous study confirmed that vfas can be utilized by heterotrophic microorganisms for reduction of high valence pollutants lu et al 2020 3 7 proposed mechanistic pathway and environmental significance in summary pyrrhotite driven se vi bioreduction have been achieved successfully through multiple pathways chemoautotrophic genera thiobacillus independently mediated bioreduction of se vi and the oxidization of pyrrhotite se vi was also bioreduced through synergistic pathway in which metabolic intermediates e g vfas were synthesized by autotrophic fe ii and s ii oxidizers e g thiobacillus which were utilized by heterotrophic se vi reducers e g pseudomonas to realize the se vi detoxification genes encoding specialized reductase sera and nitrite reductase nirs governed the se vi and se iv reduction while gene soxb was devoted to s 0 oxidation se vi was reduced to insoluble se 0 while pyrrhotite was oxidized to fe iii and so4 2 in this study the functional genus thiobacillus governed the se vi reduction and pyrrhotite oxidation synchronously this study also provided more insight into biogeochemical process during se vi bioreduction suggesting that pyrrhotite was an efficient and sustainable material for the remediation of se vi contaminated aquifer the ubiquitous existence of bacteria in aquifer benefited the re generation of reactive sites in pyrrhotite in order to achieve persistent bioreduction potential for se vi ma et al 2019 meanwhile thiobacillus was widely distributed in nature water sediment and soil fjerdingstad 1969 zhai et al 2016 and with high biological safety enabling their utilization for contaminants bioremediation in practical application therefore the proposed bioprocesses can be implemented with pyrrhotite packed biological permeable reactive barrier gibert et al 2011 further research can be performed to explore the influence of geological factors on bioreduction process as well as the impact of coexisting pollutants in aquifer such as v v and so4 2 du et al 2020 moreover the recovery of se 0 generated in this bioprocess should also be considered due to its extensive usage in industrial and pharmaceutical applications johnson et al 1999 forootanfara et al 2014 4 conclusions in this work se vi bio transformation with natural pyrrhotite as electron donor in the simulated aquifer was evaluated the following conclusions were drawn batch test indicated the feasibility of se vi bioreduction supported by pyrrhotite completed se vi removal was achieved at 10 mg l of se vi initial concentration with 0 56 ml min constant flow rate in continuous column and reactor performance varied under the influence of hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry 81 4 1 07 and 18 6 1 39 of se vi removals were obtained by breakthrough study attributing to the biotic and abiotic process respectively se vi was reduced to insoluble se 0 while pyrrhotite was oxidized to fe iii and so4 2 microbial community examination pure culture verification metagenomic and qpcr analyses collectively confirmed the occurrence of both independent and synergistic mechanisms of se vi bioreduction with the presence of pyrrhotite declaration of competing interest the

essential benefit for nutritional demand on the contrary excessive selenium incurs toxic effects on human health to fulfill the basic nutrition needs 40 μg day intake of selenium is required while the adverse impact appears with more than 400 μg day selenium intake navarro alarcon and cabrera vique 2008 world health organization who has published guideline for drinking water i e 40 μg l zhu et al 2017 nancharaiah et al 2018 however selenium with high concentration of 6000 μg l and 9000 μg l were detected in aquifers in utah and colorado the usa respectively ji and wang 2017 therefore more efforts are needed to diminish the risks imposed by selenium in drinking water source tetravalent selenium se iv and hexavalent selenium se vi are regarded as the predominant existing forms in aqueous media and se iv exhibits greater toxicity than se vi latorre et al 2013 due to less toxicity and lower mobility of elemental selenium se 0 reduction of soluble se vi and se iv to se 0 is regarded as an effective pathway for selenium detoxification which can be achieved through biological and abiotic process fu et al 2014 qiao et al 2018 se vi can be removed abiotically through ion exchange adsorption or chemical reduction nishimura 2007 santos et al 2015 yoon et al 2011 however conventional methods incur high operation cost and produce secondary pollutants leading to impracticality for real application biological removal of se vi is a favorable technology attributed primarily to its cost effectiveness either heterotrophic or autotrophic process is employed for the bioreduction of se vi ontiveros valencia et al 2016 with emphasis on exploring the optimal electron donors organic matter is commonly used for electron donors in heterotrophic se vi reduction however it may generate excessive amount of biomass and thereby clogging the aquifer lenz et al 2009 he et al 2020 in comparison autotrophic process provides an alternative approach for the se vi transformation without external organic addition liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 hydrogen and methane are gaseous electron donors in autotrophic system responsible for bio conversation of se vi lai et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 apparently the safe usage and storage of such gaseous donors have become an issue hu et al 2022 resulting in extra precaution measures inorganic solid electron donors such as fe 0 and s 0 have been used for autotrophic bioreduction of heavy metals but both materials require costly manufacture process restricting the extensive use in environmental application zhang et al 2018 yelton et al 2013 natural fe ii bearing materials suits greatly to se vi biotransformation in real application as one of the most abundant and widely distributed iron sulfur minerals in natural geological matrix pyrrhotite is effectively used in the removal of as iii and no3 n li et al 2021b the low investment and easy regeneration of pyrrhotite make it more suitable to application of in situ remediation to date few studies have reported that utilizing pyrrhotite to bio reduce se vi and little is known about the relative contribution of biotic and abiotic process for se vi removal with mechanistic insight in this work the bioprocess of autotrophic microbial se vi reduction driven by pyrrhotite was investigated under anaerobic condition in simulated aquifer column study under varied influence factors were conducted to explore the change in performance of se vi bioreduction characterization of the produced precipitates and analysis of microbiology were also performed the main objectives are 1 to understand the feasibility and performance of se vi bioreduction supported by pyrrhotite 2 to determine the final product and reveal the microbial community evolution and functional genes 3 to propose the mechanistic pathway of bioreduction process this study provides new insights into the biodetoxification of se vi with pyrrhotite as a natural electron donor in aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 batch experiment plexiglass bottles with the volume of 250 ml were employed as batch reactors which was then sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimp caps to maintain strict anaerobic condition the biotic reactor contained 5 g natural pyrrhotite haoyu company guangdong china 50 ml aquifer sediment collected from a smelting site in panzhihua china as the inoculum this sediment with cell dry weight of 6 7 mg g sediment had been used in previous studies zhang et al 2019b li et al 2021a 200 ml synthetic groundwater flushed with nitrogen gas for 30 min to remove oxygen containing bicarbonate as the inorganic carbon source was also supplemented se vi was added in the form of na2seo4 with initial concentration of 10 mg l the bioreactors were incubated for two months before data collection the endogenous and sterilized groups consisted of only 50 ml fresh and sterilized 20 min at 121 c aquifer sediment respectively the abiotic group contained only 5 g natural pyrrhotite synthetic groundwater with the same amount and component as the biotic group was also provided for the three controls additionally pure thiobacillus denitrificans t denitrificans bacillus subtilis b subtilis and pseudomonas stutzeri p stutzeri representing the functional genera were employed in batch trials lu et al 2023 the initial od600 for all biotic groups was 1 0 all treatments of autotrophic t denitrificans were built with the same condition as the above ones while representative volatile fatty acids vfas instead of pyrrhotite were used for heterotrophic b subtilis and p stutzeri all experiments were conducted at room temperature 22 2 c in triplicates 2 2 column experiment and breakthrough study a cylindrical plexiglass column with 25 cm height and 5 cm diameter was used for continuous flow bioreactor the reactor was packed with 50 ml aquifer sediment and 200 g pyrrhotite and covered by aluminum foil to prevent light exposure quartz sand was used to fill the remaining column space all fillings were thoroughly mixed synthetic groundwater was continuously up flowed into the reactor at a prescribed flow rate through a peristaltic pump bt100 1 l longer uk na2seo4 was employed as the source of se vi of designated concentrations the column experiment lasted consecutive 258 d which was divided into five stages to investigate the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical influence on pyrrhotite driven se vi removal table 1 the effluent samples were daily collected and analyzed biomass samples were examined at each stage for microbial community analysis the generated precipitates functional genes and intermediate metabolites were also measured all experiments were carried out at room temperature 22 2 c additional two cylindrical columns of 25 cm height and 5 cm diameter were employed to conduct the breakthrough study of se vi removal four sampling ports were located at 5 10 15 20 cm from the bottom of each reactor one reactor was packed with the same additives as the column experiment i e biotic column while the other one contained no inoculum i e abiotic column 1 pv pore volume of column flushing was completed within 2 h according to which pump rate was adjusted liquid samples were taken from the effluent to monitor the fluctuation of se vi concentration 2 3 analytical methods all aqueous samples were filtered immediately through a 0 22 μm filter membrane after collection then centrifuged at 12 580 g for 20 min to remove se 0 and the suspended microbial cells before analysis ph orp and conductivity were measured by a multiparameter water quality meter sevenexcellences400 mettler toledo switzerland total se concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms x series thermo fisher germany spectrophotometric method uv2300 shanghai china was employed to analyze se iv concentration according to previous study li et al 2014 jain et al 2015 and se vi was detected after being reduced to se iv by hydrochloric acid brimmer et al 1987 xie et al 2017 no3 n nitrite no2 n and ammonium nh4 n concentrations were also measured utilizing spectrophotometry shi et al 2020 analysis of sulfate so4 2 sulfite so3 2 and thiosulfate s2o3 2 concentrations were achieved by ion chromatography basic ic 792 metrohm switzerland scanning electron microscope sem jeol jax 840 hitachi japan equipped with

rigaku japan analysis was carried out 2 4 microbiological analysis biomass from both inoculum and each stage of the column were sampled to analyze microbial community structure samples were sent to shanghai majorbio technology shanghai china for high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing using miseq illumina usa and metagenomic sequencing employing hiseq illumina usa platforms after being collected for dna extraction amplification and purification zhang et al 2020a he et al 2023 centrifugation was conducted to remove moisture from the samples before analysis operational taxonomic units otus were clustered from sequences with a 0 03 distance limit equivalent to 97 similarity wang et al 2021 relative gene abundances were expressed in the form of trans per million tpm lu et al 2023 the obtained data were processed with reported methods jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2022a functional genes possibly involved in se vi reduction sera napa and srdbac se iv reduction nirs and psra s ii oxidation soxb fe ii oxidation mtra and electron transfer omcb and mtrc were quantified by real time quantitative pcr qpcr detection system abi 7500 applied biosystems usa with primers listed in table s1 supporting information cytochrome c cyt c on cell surfaces and intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh were also monitored and normalized to volatile suspended solids vss according to previously documented procedure zhang et al 2019a shi et al 2020 intermediate metabolites were examined to better elaborate the mechanism a gas chromatograph agilent 4890 j w scientific usa equipped with a flame ionization detector was utilized to determine vfas zhang et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 se vi removal in the batch bioreactors the performance of se vi reduction in three typical continuous cycles were showed in fig 1 a se vi was progressively removed with time in biotic group confirming the feasibility of se vi reduction by nature pyrrhotite se vi removal efficiency in a typical cycle 72 h was 98 6 1 18 corresponding to se vi removal rate of 1 16 0 04 mg l h the pseudo first order reaction kinetics process of the biotic group was 0 0552 d 1 r2 0 97 fig 1b this effectiveness of se vi reduction could be attributed to the reduced fe ii with high reactivity in the pyrrhotite grabb et al 2017 in addition s ii structure in pyrrhotite may contribute to the bioreduction process according to the previous reports bérenguer et al 2019 hu et al 2020 a decrease in effluent se vi concentration was initially observed in all control groups fig s1 supporting information at the end of the first cycle the removal efficiency of se vi in endogenous sterilized and abiotic groups reached 42 7 0 44 46 9 0 61 and 68 8 1 82 respectively which might be ascribed to the microbial endogenous metabolism adsorption and direct reduction by pyrrhotite respectively however se vi reduction gradually diminished as pyrrhotite was progressively passivated due to the formation of fe iii oxide on the surface causing hindrance to the electron transfer process mullet et al 2004 microbial activities could attenuate the passivation through dissolving the precipitates partially zhong et al 2017 both electron donor and microorganisms are essential to the bioreduction of se vi the above findings demonstrated the promising results of using pyrrhotite as an electron donor to bioreduce and biodetoxify se vi effectively 3 2 long term se vi removal efficient se vi elimination was observed in the column trial during 258 d operation fig 1c in the pyrrhotite packed biological column in stage 1 day 0 94 se vi was completely removed with initial concentration of 10 mg l se vi and 0 56 ml min constant flow rate while se vi removal capacity was 41 8 1 59 g m3 d table 1 no accumulation of intermediate se iv was observed during this phase however se vi removal efficiency rapidly decreased to 87 1 2 71 with elevated se vi concentration 50 mg l in stage 2 day 95 135 accompanied by an increase in se vi removal capacity to 172 8 16 4 g m3 d table 1 se vi removal efficiency decreased to 71 6 3 3 and removal capacity raised to 285 7 20 9 g m3 d when the initial concentration of se vi was further increased to 100 mg l during stage 3 day 136 176 indicating the gradual adaptation of functional microorganisms to high se vi loading condition notably accumulation of se iv was monitored however it dissipated quickly at the end of stage 3 the above pattern was also observed in previous reports li et al 2022 se vi removal efficiency was recovered to 92 3 2 37 when flow rate and se vi concentration were adjusted to 1 68 ml min and 10 mg l respectively with decline in removal capacity to 105 0 21 9 g m3 d in stage 4 day 177 217 in stage 5 day 218 258 10 mg l no3 n was introduced as widely distributed co existing pollutant with se vi in groundwater neupane et al 2020 with other operation condition identical to stage 1 removal efficiency and removal capacity of se vi decreased to 83 7 3 89 and 34 3 1 5 g m3 d respectively while 97 9 0 84 of no3 n was removed implying that no3 n was the preferred electron acceptor utilized by the microbial metabolism consisting with the previous report he et al 2021 similar pattern was observed by other researchers where se vi bioreduction was suppressed by no3 n when both co existed at equal levels owning to difference in physiological natures of no3 n and se vi reductases oremland et al 1999 lucas and hollibaugh 2001 3 3 determination of biotic and abiotic contributions fig 2 a showed se vi breakthrough curves for different reactor groups se vi removal reached complete breakthrough i e c c0 1 at 134 pv and 32 pv in biotic and abiotic column respectively migration rate of 0 58 0 03 cm pv in the se vi front was obtained in biotic column while a more rapid migration of 2 53 0 17 cm pv for se vi was attained in abiotic column fig 2b in the biotic column with pyrrhotite se vi was removed biotically and abiotically the reaction sites of pyrrhotite could be re generated through microbial activities such as secretion of acidic metabolites and or reduction of the fe iii produced gan et al 2018 which extended the reaction time between se vi and pyrrhotite resulting in prolonged lifetime of the column in the abiotic column structural fe ii in pyrrhotite reduced se vi abiotically however the passivation produced by iron oxides decreased the activity of mineral leading to the restriction of se vi removal based on above result the biotic and abiotic contributions to se vi removal were 81 4 1 07 and 18 6 1 39 respectively furthermore despite of the rapid breakthrough occurred in 5 cm port 5 cm from the inlet the breakthrough time extended from 70 pv to 134 pv when the column height changed from 10 cm to 25 cm suggesting that the lifetime of the column had prolonged when the column height increased rout et al 2017 similar behavior was also observed in abiotic column fig s2 supporting information 3 4 characterization of reaction products the biological column turned dark red at the end of the operation fig 3 a suggesting the generation of se 0 as result of se vi bioreduction yang et al 2016 fig 3b showed that se vi and se iv existed in the effluent with other forms of se such as se 0 unaccounted dissolved selenium and organic selenium tan et al 2018 xia et al 2019 li et al 2022 morphological characterization was implemented to further confirm the generation of metal precipitate sem image showed the presence of spheroids on the surface of the precipitate fig 3c the presence of se 0 in precipitate was also verified by the eds spectrum fig s3a supporting information xrd patterns exhibited the characteristic peaks corresponded to feo oh fig 3d chmielewská et al 2017 possibly derived from pyrrhotite oxidation meanwhile the se 3d xps spectrum of precipitates in fig 3e displayed characteristic peaks at 56 8 ev and 55 9 ev which was attributed to se 0 gonzalez gil et al 2016 zhang et al 2020b all above results indicated that solid se 0 was the major product from se vi bioreduction soluble fe species was not detectable in the effluent during the whole operation however fe was displayed as elemental component in the eds plot fig s3a supporting information xps spectra in 712 5 ev and 726 ev peak signal demonstrated the presence of fe fig 3f tang et al 2016 suggesting the oxidation of fe ii in pyrrhotite to fe iii which may adsorb se vi to form weakly bounded metal complex ziemkiewicz et al 2011 tan et al 2016 however the adsorption of fe iii to se vi was more likely occurred in acidic conditions in this study ph value has remained above 7 fig s3b supporting information which unlikely facilitated the adsorption of se vi with pyrrhotite conversion products highlighting the contribution of biological process ziemkiewicz et al 2011 tan et al 2016 the accumulation of so4 2 and trace of so3 2 were also observed in the effluent fig 1c fig s3c supporting information which might be originated from s ii oxidation in pyrrhotite s2o3 2 was undetectable throughout the process the peak of s 2p xps spectrum at 163 5 ev was related to s 0 fig 3f mullet et al 2004 which might be the product of incomplete oxidation of s ii in pyrrhotite serving as electron donor to bioreduce se vi li et al 2022 concentrations of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were below the detection limit suggesting the realization of complete denitrification process fig s3d supporting information zhang et al 2015 han et al 2020 1 3 seo 4 2 2 fes 4 h 2 o 3 s e 0 2 f e 3 2 so 4 2 8 o h 2 9 no 3 5 fes 7 h 2 o 5 f e 3 5 so 4 2 4 5 n 2 14 o h the stoichiometrical relationships between oxidants and reductant were calculated in stage 4 0 44 0 09 mmol se vi was removed daily which would produce 0 29 0 02 mmol so4 2 theoretically according to eq 1 in fact accumulation of 0 84 0 05 mmol so4 2 was observed based on eq 1 and eq 2 0 14 0 02 mmol se vi and 0 34 0 01 mmol no3 were removed daily in stage 5 leading to theoretical production of 0 28 0 06 mmol so4 2 actually 0 62 0 12 mmol so4 2 was detected these results suggested the over consumption of pyrrhotite besides se vi and no3 n reduction other bioactivities such as biomass growth and metabolism might consumed electrons released from pyrrhotite oxidation lu et al 2020 3 5 microbial community evolution the evolution of microbial communities at class level was showed in fig 4 a gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria were enriched in all stages with higher relative abundance in the treatment process than that in the inoculum except for stage 1 3 94 anaerolineae prevailed in stage 2 5 4 26 20 0 actinobacteria increased to 20 5 in stage 2 compared to 2 02 in the inoculum fig 4b demonstrated the significant changes in microbial community structure at the genus level compared to the inoculum 3 05 thiobacillus became the dominant genus with relative abundance of 43 0 and 36 9 in stage 2 and stage 3 respectively followed by decline in stage 4 and stage 5 with relative abundance of 20 0 and 15 0 respectively as a chemoautotrophic genus thiobacillus can oxidize the substrate to release electrons and synthesize metabolites as previous study showed where thiobacillus was enriched in s 0 based system to bioreduce se vi li et al 2022 species belong to thiobacillus were able to oxidize fe ii to fe iii s ii to so4 2 and s 0 ma et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 therefore thiobacillus showed ability to mediate the process where se vi reduction was coupled to the oxidation of fe ii and s ii pure t denitrificans could efficiently reduce se vi with pyrrhotite as electron donor fig 5 a with the synthesis of vfas and accumulation of trace se iv fig 5b these results proved the critical role of thiobacillus in coupling of pyrrhotite oxidation and se vi reduction the relative abundance of longilinea had significantly increased to 16 4 in stage 3 longilinea was a strict anaerobe which can generate volatile fatty acids through fermenting carbohydrates yamada et al 2007 ma et al 2015 researchers reported that longilinea has ability to resist toxic and can reduce as v das et al 2016 brevundimonas and rhodococcus were enriched with abundance in the range of 0 19 10 0 and 0 12 13 7 in all bioreactor stages respectively indicating their survivability under various ranges of stress imposed by se vi rhodococcus was detected in se vi bioreduction process lai et al 2020 which has diverse metabolic potential to adapt various types of niche leblanc et al 2008 cappelletti et al 2016 the relative abundance of denitratisoma varied throughout stage 1 5 especially in stage 3 with greater relative abundance of 6 69 denitratisoma was typical denitrifying bacteria participating the denitrifying process and capable of utilizing clo4 as electron accepter wang et al 2019 2022b zhang et al 2022 bacillus and pseudomonas were also observed during the experiment some species in these two genera showed the capacity to reduce se vi and se iv zhang and frankenberger 2007 hunter et al 2011 mishra et al 2011 subedi et al 2017 in addition pure culture tests indicated that b subtilis and p stutzeri could reduce se vi effectively by utilizing diverse vfas fig 3c d acetate supported the quickest se vi removal for both strains these phenomena further confirmed the contributions of bacillus and pseudomonas to se vi reduction in the constructed biosystem 3 6 functional genes and metabolic metabolites metagenomic analysis indicated the dynamics of functional genes related to selenate selenite sulfur and iron metabolisms during the operation fig 6 a the sera gene was significantly enriched in simulated bioreactor despite its absence in the inoculum this result was also confirmed by qpcr analysis fig 6b this gene encoded se vi reductase which was located in the periplasmic space wen et al 2016 previous study also showed that sera enzyme a trimeric molybdoenzyme was the main subunit for the selenate reductase from thauera selenatis that could catalyzes the reduction of se vi to se iv schröder et al 1997 the increasing abundance implied that sera was the functional genes committed to se vi bioreduction another two se vi reductase genes i e napa and srdbac demoll decker and macy 1993 kuroda et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 were upregulated in the removal process as indicated by qpcr result indicating their contribution to the bioreduction of se vi to se iv metagenomics and qpcr outputs indicated nirs and psra genes appeared abundantly in bioreactors fig 6a b these two genes could mediate reduction of se iv to se 0 sabaty et al 2001 burns et al 2009 the s ii oxidation gene soxb was greatly enriched in bioreactor which could promote the oxidation of s ii in pyrrhotite even though it was not detectable in the inoculum lu et al 2019 sun et al 2020 the gene mtra was involved in fe ii oxidation liu et al 2012 which was significantly upregulated with metagenomic and qpcr evidences fig 6a b the upregulated mtrc and omcb genes could mediate fe ii oxidation trough electron transfer shi et al 2016 the contents of electron transporters such as nadh and cyt c were significantly higher in bioreactor than that in the inoculum implying their contribution to se vi bioreduction through regulating the electron transfer fig 6c vfas acted as intermediates in microbial metabolisms was also detected with average concentration of 12 0 1 36 mg l of which acetate accounted for the main fraction the intermediates might be synthesized by autotrophs utilizing either carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as the sole carbon source during bioreduction with energy harnessed from pyrrhotite oxidation estelmann et al 2011 zhang et al 2020a previous study confirmed that vfas can be utilized by heterotrophic microorganisms for reduction of high valence pollutants lu et al 2020 3 7 proposed mechanistic pathway and environmental significance in summary pyrrhotite driven se vi bioreduction have been achieved successfully through multiple pathways chemoautotrophic genera thiobacillus independently mediated bioreduction of se vi and the oxidization of pyrrhotite se vi was also bioreduced through synergistic pathway in which metabolic intermediates e g vfas were synthesized by autotrophic fe ii and s ii oxidizers e g thiobacillus which were utilized by heterotrophic se vi reducers e g pseudomonas to realize the se vi detoxification genes encoding specialized reductase sera and nitrite reductase nirs governed the se vi and se iv reduction while gene soxb was devoted to s 0 oxidation se vi was reduced to insoluble se 0 while pyrrhotite was oxidized to fe iii and so4 2 in this study the functional genus thiobacillus governed the se vi reduction and pyrrhotite oxidation synchronously this study also provided more insight into biogeochemical process during se vi bioreduction suggesting that pyrrhotite was an efficient and sustainable material for the remediation of se vi contaminated aquifer the ubiquitous existence of bacteria in aquifer benefited the re generation of reactive sites in pyrrhotite in order to achieve persistent bioreduction potential for se vi ma et al 2019 meanwhile thiobacillus was widely distributed in nature water sediment and soil fjerdingstad 1969 zhai et al 2016 and with high biological safety enabling their utilization for contaminants bioremediation in practical application therefore the proposed bioprocesses can be implemented with pyrrhotite packed biological permeable reactive barrier gibert et al 2011 further research can be performed to explore the influence of geological factors on bioreduction process as well as the impact of coexisting pollutants in aquifer such as v v and so4 2 du et al 2020 moreover the recovery of se 0 generated in this bioprocess should also be considered due to its extensive usage in industrial and pharmaceutical applications johnson et al 1999 forootanfara et al 2014 4 conclusions in this work se vi bio transformation with natural pyrrhotite as electron donor in the simulated aquifer was evaluated the following conclusions were drawn batch test indicated the feasibility of se vi bioreduction supported by pyrrhotite completed se vi removal was achieved at 10 mg l of se vi initial concentration with 0 56 ml min constant flow rate in continuous column and reactor performance varied under the influence of hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry 81 4 1 07 and 18 6 1 39 of se vi removals were obtained by breakthrough study attributing to the biotic and abiotic process respectively se vi was reduced to insoluble se 0 while pyrrhotite was oxidized to fe iii and so4 2 microbial community examination pure culture verification metagenomic and qpcr analyses collectively confirmed the occurrence of both independent and synergistic mechanisms of se vi bioreduction with the presence of pyrrhotite declaration of competing interest the

14782,the environmental behavior of radioactive cesium rcs in contaminated areas is generally governed by soil and sediment components and natural weathering conditions in this study desorption tests and spectroscopic approaches were used to explore the interaction between the weathering of micaceous minerals i e biotite and phlogopite and the adsorption of cs and the critical role of weathering in the environmental behavior of rcs results showed that the reaction sequence between weathering and cs adsorption significantly affected the surface species of cs and the structure of biotite and phlogopite regardless of whether it occurred before after or during cs adsorption weathering generated more high affinity adsorption sites namely interlayer sites its and frayed edge sites fess to different extents and then facilitated the uptake of cs at fess and its on micaceous minerals in a poorly exchangeable state cs stabilized the micaceous mineral structure once it was absorbed within collapsed interlayers by hindering cation exchange and preventing further destruction during weathering as important weathering factors high temperature and ca2 content promoted the binding of cs in the interlayers of biotite and phlogopite by enhancing interlayer cation exchange these findings are beneficial for a better understanding of the environmental behaviors of rcs in the hydrosphere and pedosphere graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords radiocesium weathering micaceous minerals adsorption cs species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a considerable amount of radioactive cesium rcs has been released into the environment as a result of nuclear accidents weapon tests and possible leakage during the disposal or treatment of radioactive waste e g the leakage of waste tanks in the hanford disposal repository buesseler 2020 steinhauser et al 2014 zachara et al 2002 rcs represent a highly hazardous class of radionuclides owing to their constant gamma radiation emission and long half life 134cs t1 2 2 07 years and 137cs t1 2 30 17 years unterweger et al 1992 given their chemical similarity to alkali metals especially potassium rcs readily migrate in the pedosphere and hydrosphere and progressively accumulate in organisms throughout the food chain kaste et al 2021 numerous previous investigations have suggested that rcs contamination is widespread in various ecosystems e g forests farmland rivers and coastal areas and that its behavior is predominantly controlled by environmental conditions onda et al 2020 takata et al 2020 koarashi et al 2019 micaceous minerals are ubiquitous in soils sediments and suspended particles park et al 2019 zachara et al 2002 the soil surrounding fukushima prefecture has been reported to be abundant in micaceous minerals which have greatly reduced the mobility and bioavailability of rcs in the area takahashi et al 2017 mukai et al 2014 the structure of micaceous minerals consists of one alumina octahedral sheet between two silica tetrahedral sheets schoonheydt et al 2018 these layers are bound together by charge compensating interlaminar k which is weakly hydrated and suitable for occupying the ditrigonal cavities on adjacent sheets a consensus has been reached that at least four types of adsorption sites exist in micaceous minerals for rcs adsorption planar sites pss and type ii sites t2ss which are located on the external basal plane or at the edge of phyllosilicates and present low adsorption affinities for the outer sphere os complexation of hydrated cs and interlayer sites its and frayed edge sites fess which are located at the wedge edge and exhibit strong affinity for the inner sphere is complexation of partially or fully dehydrated cs in ditrigonal cavities or near open edges fan et al 2014a poinssot et al 1999 evans et al 1983 the capacity of each adsorption site is greatly dependent on the type particle size and weathering state of micaceous minerals pss and t2ss are the main contributors to the cation exchange capacity cec of unweathered biotite with a specific degree of fragmentation whereas fess and its have limited contributions kitayama et al 2020 yin et al 2017 the weathering processes of minerals are omnipresent on the earth s sub surface and are consequently significantly influenced by thermal expansion and contraction drying and wetting cycles and salts in the aqueous phase weathering can accelerate cation exchange between interlaminar k and foreign cations causing a variation in basal spacing and affecting cs retention ability for example the intercalation of hydrated na mg2 ca2 and al3 into phlogopite increases the layer spacing from 1 0 nm to 1 5 nm and induces the transformation of phlogopite into a vermiculite like mineral tamura et al 2014 meanwhile the formation of a certain amount of fes at the transition regions between nonexpanded and expanded interlayers enhances the irreversibility of cs binding to micaceous minerals kitayama et al 2020 clearly weathering processes are expected to alter the structure of minerals and the distribution of cs adsorption sites murakami et al 2016 mohanty et al 2014 mckinley et al 2004 generally the final state of micaceous minerals in the environment is always dependent on various simultaneous and coupled weathering processes numerous spectroscopic studies have explored the mechanisms underlying weathering and its effect on cs retention several researches have revealed that weathering can produce more fess and its within micaceous minerals which are beneficial to the adsorption of rcs and largely enhance the retardation of rcs in the environment park et al 2019 fuller et al 2015 mckinley et al 2004 for example fan et al 2014a found that os complexes greatly contributed to cs adsorption on illite whereas almost pure is complexes contribute to cs adsorption on vermiculite moreover park et al 2019 and mckinley et al 2004 reported that cs can be converted into a more stable or irreversible fraction through soil weathering processes from another perspective cs adsorption may affect the structural transformation of micaceous minerals several studies have suggested that these phenomena mainly originate from irreversible cs adsorption and attempts have been made to explain their underlying mechanisms on the basis of relative charge density hydrated radius and hydration energy of cations park et al 2019 fan et al 2014a benedicto et al 2014 tansel et al 2012 fess play an important role in cs fixation in micaceous minerals owing to their special spatial structure fess are more likely to accommodate weakly hydrated cs than cations with a large hydrated radius e g ca2 and mg2 fuller et al 2015 cs has lower hydration energy a smaller hydrated ion radius and a higher charge density than k therefore fess are several orders of magnitude more selective for the adsorption of cs than for k and the selectivity coefficients of cs to k log cs kk is 4 6 at fess park et al 2019 fan and takahashi 2017 lee et al 2017 yin et al 2017 fan et al 2014 cs captured in fess is mainly trapped within the size compatible hexagonal cavities of tetrahedral planar sheets and closely shielded by two adjacent sheets in a thermodynamically stable state readily causing to an interlayer collapse yin et al 2020 lee et al 2017 dzene et al 2015 therefore along with the fixation of cs fess gradually collapse and transform into collapsed interlayer which benefits the fixation of cs on a macroscopic scale after the adsorption and fixation of cs expandable micaceous minerals are indeed transformed into a non expandable structure and a mineral similar to the primary mineral biotite is formed which cannot be re expanded by the hydrated cations fuller et al 2015 considering that weathering is a time dependent and typically slow process micaceous minerals in various states of weathering may exist in a given soil aaron et al 2000 once cs is accidentally leaked into the environment its environmental behavior is determined by the weathering process however most previous studies focused on the adsorption and desorption of cs on unweathered micaceous minerals and did not conduct a clear and systematic analysis of the interactions between the weathering of micaceous minerals and the adsorption of cs yin et al 2020 fuller et al 2015 hyun shik et al 2011 in this study three treatment sequences were designed to explore the mechanism underlying the interaction between cs adsorption and micaceous mineral weathering during the experiments the structural alteration in biotite and phlogopite and the adsorption of cs were analyzed through batch sorption desorption experiments and x ray diffraction xrd to understand how the weathering process regulates the behavior of cs adsorption on micaceous minerals the results of this work can provide practical support for environmental remediation in areas contaminated with radioactive substances and are vital for extending the theoretical basis of cs migration and transformation in the hydrosphere and pedosphere 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials biotite and phlogopite obtained from lingshou county hebei province china were chosen as representative micaceous minerals before the experiments biotite and phlogopite were milled by using a mortar and passed through a 325 mesh sieve in this study cec measurement was conducted in accordance with the method of bradbury 1998 and the cec values of biotite and phlogopite were found to be 12 45 and 25 31 meq 100 g respectively the n2 brunauer emmett and teller specific surface areas of biotite and phlogopite were 5 7 0 3 and 5 3 0 2 m2 g respectively all of the chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and were not subjected to additional treatment before use 2 2 preparation of biotite and phlogopite as shown in fig 1 three treatment sequences for the weathering of micaceous minerals biotite and phlogopite and the adsorption of cs were established to mimic the interplay between micaceous mineral weathering and rcs contamination in nature sequence 1 was a two step treatment representing a scenario in which biotite or phlogopite underwent some weathering before cesium addition in this scenario biotite or phlogopite was successively affected by simulated weathering and cs adsorption in brief 2 5 g of biotite or phlogopite was suspended in 0 25 l of 0 2 mol l cacl2 solution in a temperature controlled water bath at 80 c for 48 h tmaura et al 2014 stout et al 2006 subsequently the suspension was separated by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 30 min and washed several times with milli q water to remove excess ca2 then residual biotite or phlogopite particles were freeze dried for the following adsorption experiment 2 5 g of biotite or phlogopite weathered as described above was dispersed in 0 25 l of 2 0 10 5 4 0 10 3 and 1 6 10 2 mol l cscl solutions then equilibrated in a 25 c incubator shaker for 48 h finally supernatants were filtered and collected through a 0 22 μm membrane for the measurement of cs concentration residual particles were washed with milli q water freeze dried for further characterization and denoted as bio w cs and phl w cs the cs concentrations in solutions were measured through ion chromatography ics 600 thermo fisher usa in sequence 2 fresh biotite or phlogopite was added with cesium and then weathered approximately 2 5 g of biotite or phlogopite was equilibrated with 0 25 l of 2 0 10 5 or 4 0 10 3 mol l cscl solution in a 25 c shaking incubator for 48 h particle separation and cs concentration analysis were performed following adsorption equilibration and were similar to the procedures conducted in sequence 1 then 2 5 g of the saturated biotite or phlogopite sample was suspended in 0 25 l of 0 2 mol l cacl2 solution and weathered in an 80 c water bath for 48 h the procedures for separation and cs concentration analysis were identical to those mentioned above the finally obtained solid samples were collected for subsequent characterization and denoted as bio cs w and phl cs w in sequence 3 weathering and cs adsorption on biotite or phlogopite occurred simultaneously briefly 2 5 g of biotite or phlogopite was dispersed in 0 25 l of a solution containing cacl2 and cscl to examine the role of cs in this system we set two cs concentrations 2 0 10 5 or 4 0 10 3 mol l respectively the concentration of cacl2 is constant to 0 2 mol l the resulting suspensions were then placed in an 80 c water bath for 48 h for adsorption equilibration and weathering the methods for the subsequent separation and cs concentration analysis were the same as those introduced in sequence 1 the obtained samples were denoted as bio w cs and phl w cs given that soils can experience different degrees of cs contamination solutions with various cs concentrations were employed during micaceous mineral treatment the details of the sample preparation and characterization procedures are presented in sections s1 and s2 in the supplementary information during weathering less than 0 6 and 0 2 wt of biotite and phlogopite were dissolved respectively all sample preparation and adsorption desorption tests were conducted in duplicate to acquire sufficient samples and reliable data 2 3 desorption procedure sequential desorption experiments were performed by using a modified semicontinuous approach in accordance with rigol 1999b to identify the cs surface species on micaceous minerals the complete sequential desorption process included five cycles of desorption steps in the first cycle 0 1 g of the prepared sample was dispersed in 5 0 ml of a mixed solution containing 0 01 m nh4cl and 0 01 m nacl then the mixture was shaken in a 25 c incubator for 24 h following equilibration the suspension was separated from the liquid without drying and subsequently directly suspended in a freshly prepared solution of the same composition to complete the next desorption cycle the concentration of cs in every filtrate was quantified to calculate the cs desorption ratio in every single desorption cycle on the basis of the initial adsorption capacity and the overall desorption ratio for each sample was then summed and denoted as fe the residual cs within the solid was regarded as the fraction with low bioavailability fr which can be calculated by subtracting the fe moiety from the total amount that is 100 desorption experiments on biotite phlogopite weathered biotite and weathered phlogopite were conducted as blanks and no cs was detected in the filtrates after the same desorption procedures 2 4 effects of ca2 and temperature given that temperature and ca2 content are the main weathering factors their role in the structural variations in micaceous minerals and the distribution of cs was examined through a batch experiment solutions containing 1 5 10 5 4 5 10 4 m cscl in the comparative system were used to obtain adsorption isotherms and the solid to liquid ratio was set to 1 0 g l specifically for evaluating the effect of ca2 a 0 01 m cacl2 solution was employed as the background electrolyte and a series of tests without the background electrolyte were conducted at room temperature and served as the control the equilibrium temperature was set to 4 0 c and 80 c to investigate the effect of temperature and no extra electrolyte was added to the equilibrium solutions in addition to xrd analysis and isotherm determination the fluctuations in the content of leached k and adsorbed cs during the equilibration process were investigated the ph values of reaction solutions were tested at room temperature before and after sample preparation and the ph of the samples was between 6 8 and 7 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural variations in biotite and phlogopite 3 1 1 weathering before cs adsorption sequence 1 the xrd patterns and assumed structural models of weathered biotite and phlogopite before and after cs adsorption are shown in fig 2 in contrast to unweathered biotite and phlogopite specimens which had a d spacing of 1 01 nm 2θ 8 7 weathered micaceous minerals exhibited a new peak at 5 7 that corresponded to a d spacing of 1 53 nm these results are consistent with previous findings showing that after weathering ca2 can enter and expand interlayers tamura et al 2014 fig 2a illustrates that weathering produced a mixed layer of biotite in which ca2 was partially exchanged for k in biotite and that most interlayers remained closed in contrast to those of biotite the xrd patterns of weathered phlogopite exhibited a strong and sharp peak at 2θ 5 7 fig 2b revealing that phlogopite was considerably more easily weathered than biotite weathering destroyed the attraction of the interlaminar structure to k allowing cations to exchange freely into the phlogopite interlayer structure biotite and phlogopite exhibited significantly different responses to weathering likely due to their different binding affinities for interlayer k and their different chemical compositions in the environment phlogopite tends to exist in its trioctahedral form which readily undergoes depotassication however in most cases biotite is in a dioctahedral form with a high charge density and nonexpansible properties bergaya et al 2006 the excess iron ions in biotite easily isomorphically replace the si atoms in a tetrahedron thus affecting atomic arrangement and improving k binding affinity magnesium rich phlogopite has a lower negative charge density owing to a lack of isomorphic substitution as a result interlaminar k has a smaller attraction force and is more easily replaced in phlogopite than in biotite aaron et al 2000 kalinowski et al 1996 during the subsequent cs adsorption process the xrd feature related to ca2 intercalation 2θ 5 7 progressively diminished as cs concentration increased fig 2 the interlayers expanded by ca2 readily collapsed during cs adsorption causing the interlayer spacing to decrease from 1 53 nm to 1 02 nm thus as reflected by the characteristic peak at 2θ 5 7 fig 2b cs concentration exerted an important effect on interlayer transformation especially in weathered phlogopite the interlayer of the weathered phlogopite required abundant cs 16 0 mm to be occupied whereas that of weathered biotite required only 4 0 mm cs to be occupied these observations indicated that in a natural environment weathering can produce numerous adsorption sites in interlayers with a high fixation potential for rcs given that dehydrated cs is size compatible with hexagonal cavities in si o tetrahedral sheets it can substitute for ca2 fig 2c which is likely to be retained within two adjacent sheets park et al 2019 lee et al 2017 bio w cs and phl w cs samples were weathered again to further validate the effect of cs adsorption on the weathering of micaceous minerals after this process the xrd pattern did not show any apparent changes and the final structures of biotite and phlogopite remained dependent on the amount of cs that had diffused into interlayers figs 2 and 3 in contrast to that of the original biotite and phlogopite fig 2 the weathering of bio w cs and phl w cs samples did not aggravate interlayer expansion fig 3 revealing that ca2 did not enter the interlayers of biotite and phlogopite during the second round of weathering therefore ca2 in the aqueous phase tended to replace k in the original micaceous mineral layers however such a replacement cannot occur after the adsorption of cs under the same weathering conditions the selective adsorption of cs at fess was several orders of magnitude higher than that of ca2 and cs can be firmly held in interlayer hexagonal cavities lee et al 2017 fuller et al 2015 masahiko et al 2013 these results suggested that after cs adsorption the structure of the micaceous minerals becomes more stable and additional weathering does not further change the micaceous mineral structure 3 1 2 weathering after cs adsorption on micaceous minerals sequence 2 different from the above scenario weathering after cs adsorption barely altered the interlayer structure of biotite and phlogopite in contrast to those of phlogopite saturated with 0 02 mm cs the xrd patterns of the mica cs w samples exhibited few noticeable weathering features fig 4 implying that cs adsorption before weathering can strengthen the interlayer structure of micaceous minerals in addition the higher the cs concentration in the saturation solution was the stronger the reinforcement effect was only a small amount of cs can reach the sites around the interlayer margin through mechanically broken channels because biotite and phlogopite are phyllosilicates with low expansion ability the replacement of anhydrous k with cs in interlayers should be limited therefore no significant response in terms of structural alteration occurred after cs saturation was achieved fig 4a b moreover after the adsorption of cs on biotite and phlogopite the entrances to fess and its were occupied by cs and then collapsed to form a stable structure this effect revealed that under the subsequent weathering treatment the channels of fess and its became unavailable to ca2 mainly owing to interlayer collapse after cs adsorption mckinley et al 2001 when the cs concentration of the saturation solution was low cs could not fully occupy all the sites around interlayer entrances although the entrances succumbed to the same weathering treatments and ca2 could enter interlayers the degree of weathering was low 3 1 3 simultaneous weathering and cs adsorption sequence 3 the variations in cs adsorption behavior and biotite or phlogopite structure under simultaneous weathering and cs adsorption were analyzed to understand the circumstances under which cesium addition and weathering jointly affect micaceous minerals such conditions include long term rcs leakage from radionuclide storage tanks in waste repositories mckinley et al 2001 fig 5 a and b illustrates that the structural response of biotite and phlogopite to weathering drastically decreased or completely vanished this effect was related to cs concentration indicating that cs adsorption and weathering can simultaneously induce structural changes the relevant mechanism mainly involved three steps or pathways i cs directly replaced anhydrous k in the interlayer margin positions and occupied the entrance of interlayers thus hindering the entry of other ions ii weathering treatment increased ca2 content and temperature might have facilitated the entry of cs into interlayers under warm conditions ca2 opened interlayers which is a prerequisite for the smooth and free entry of cs into interlayers subsequently cs and ca2 competed for adsorption sites in interlayers and most ca2 ions were ultimately expelled iii given that the low cs content 2 0 10 5 m in the solution was insufficient to replace all ca2 in interlayers the easily weathered phlogopite underwent mild weathering fig 5b therefore in terms of the above three sequences the adsorption of cs improved the stability of micaceous minerals and increased their resistance to weathering through different pathways 3 2 speciation of cs during different treatment sequences a series of semicontinuous desorption with na nh4 solution were conducted to explore the behavior of cs adsorption on biotite and phlogopite table s1 after five desorption cycles the residual cs in micaceous minerals probably bind at sites with strong affinity therefore it was difficult to replace and had low bioavailability fig 6 a shows that after saturation the cs adsorption capacity of biotite reached 6 04 mg g and 65 of the adsorbed cs could be desorbed during the subsequent weathering treatment some cs desorbed from biotite i e the bio cs w sample and the amount of cs remaining in the solid phase decreased to 3 30 mg g indicating that 79 of the adsorbed cs existed in the residual fraction fig 6a in addition the residual fraction of cs in biotite increased from 2 11 mg g to 2 61 mg g after weathering these findings revealed that channels into the inner layers were lacking because the fresh micaceous minerals had not yet been weathered yet thus the majority of cs adsorbed on external sites and easily desorbed although successive weathering no longer induced a detectable change in the structures of micaceous minerals fig 4 weathering following cs adsorption resulted in the increased conversion of cs into the residual fraction this finding is consistent with the aging effect of cs reported by previous studies that is cs tends to constantly seek adsorption sites with strong affinity e g fess and iss during weathering rigol et al 1999a absalom et al 1999 comans et al 1991 accordingly this study further confirmed the conjecture that the adsorption of cs on sites with strong affinity can improve the weathering resistance of micaceous minerals the bio w cs sample exhibited higher cs adsorption capacity up to 11 25 mg g and fixation residual fraction up to 55 than the bio cs w and biotite samples revealing that in the absence of the hindrance of interlayer collapse abundant external and internal adsorption sites formed during the advanced weathering treatment xrd patterns in fig 2 compared with the original biotite sample the bio w cs sample exhibited a considerable increase in cs adsorption i e from 6 04 mg g to 10 0 mg g and the synergistic effects of weathering and cs adsorption accounted for the largest proportion of poorly desorbed cs up to 83 fig 6a these results suggested that the co occurrence of weathering and cs adsorption enhances the adsorption of cs in interlayers generally weathering maximized the structural alteration in micaceous minerals fig 2 and generated more adsorption sites with strong affinity ultimately resulting in higher cs adsorption capacity and a high proportion of the residual fraction fig 6 although the bio w cs sample showed little change in its cs adsorption capacity it had higher relative ratio 83 and absolute concentration 8 3 mg g of poorly desorbed cs than the bio w cs sample likely due to the combined results of the following processes i owing to the weathering resistance of biotite only a limited amount of biotite interlayers could be expanded during weathering fig 2c cs ions that entered firstly into the interlayers collapsed interlayers and obstructed the entry of subsequent cs ions thus reducing the adsorption of cs and the proportion of the residual fraction mckinley et al 2001 ii high temperature may have accelerated ion exchange between k and foreign ions such as ca2 and cs in the bio w cs sample allowing more ca2 and cs to enter interlayers fig 5c lamarca irisarri et al 2019 white et al 1999 iii given that cs and ca2 coexisted during the bio w cs experiments competitive adsorption inevitably occurred particularly at external sites in contrast to that on the original biotite the adsorption of cs on phlogopite exhibited strong irreversibility fig 6b this difference may be due to the chemical compositions and weathering resistances of biotite and phlogopite aaron et al 2000 kalinowski et al 1996 as a trioctahedral micaceous mineral phlogopite exhibits a lower binding affinity for interlaminar k than biotite and is subject to expansion thus it is prone to generating more interlayer adsorption sites fig 2b shows that phlogopite was more easily weathered leading to the generation of more adsorption sites with strong affinity compared with the original phlogopite sample the phl cs w sample exhibited a minor decrease in cs adsorption from 21 51 mg g to 17 93 mg g revealing that cs could not be efficiently desorbed during weathering at higher temperatures and ca2 concentrations the uptake and poorly desorbed percentage of cs in the phl w cs 31 75 mg g and 89 and phl w cs 86 29 mg g and 94 samples were higher than those in the phlogopite sample 21 51 mg g and 76 the phl w cs sample exhibited a higher cs adsorption amount and a lower desorption proportion than the phl w cs sample the xrd patterns fig 2b showed that the interlayer splaying of phlogopite was more extensive than that of biotite and the weathering characteristic peak 2θ 5 7 of phlogopite decreased slowly as the cs concentration increased additional quantities of cs were needed to make the characteristic peak disappear the weathered phlogopite contained extensive interlaminar channels for efficient k leaching and cs adsorption that reduced the self inhibiting effect of cs cs adsorbs on biotite and phlogopite mainly at fess its t2ss and pss however biotite and phlogopite have different it and fes capacities owing to their different charge densities and expansibilities resulting in the different species and behaviors of cs although the reaction sequence of cs adsorption and weathering influenced cs adsorption behavior and biotite and phlogopite structures weathering promoted the exchange of interlayer cations and the residual fraction of cs increased to a certain degree regardless of whether weathering occurred after or during cs adsorption cs strengthened micaceous mineral interlayers and hindered the weathering deterioration process owing to its stabilizing effect when retained in interlayers 3 3 roles of temperature and ca2 in the entry of cs into interlayers as a consequence of sequential desorption fig 6 the amounts of adsorbed cs and residual cs fraction increased with the increase in temperature and ca2 content taking biotite as an example fig 6a the presence of 0 2 m ca2 solution increased cs adsorption from 6 04 mg g to 8 95 mg g and the residual fraction of cs on biotite increased by 44 for the bio cs ca sample at 80 c cs adsorption on biotite increased from 6 04 mg g to 8 42 mg g and the residual cs fraction reached 53 these findings revealed that in nature higher temperatures and ca2 contents could facilitate cs adsorption and diffusion into biotite and phlogopite interlayers more cs ions were present in the form of residual fractions in the bio cs ca sample 79 than in the bio cs 80 c sample 53 moreover the adsorption capacity and fixation of cs on biotite and phlogopite were higher under the combined effect of these two factors mica w cs fig 6 given that cs is generally believed to be well fixed in micaceous mineral interlayers and is difficult to be substituted by other cations micaceous mineral interlayers open up under warm and ca2 rich conditions the adsorption isotherms fig 7 a b c showed that the cs adsorption capacities of biotite and phlogopite increased at higher ca2 contents the xrd patterns revealed that in the control sample the basal spacing of phlogopite was invariable under the infiltration of deionized water blue line in fig 7d a faint peak appeared at 2θ 5 7 after ca2 saturation red line in fig 7d however when phlogopite was equilibrated in the solution containing cs and ca2 the peak reflecting ca2 insertion into the interlayers disappeared black line in fig 7d this finding revealed that the diffusion of water molecules is not the root cause of the interlayer expansion of phlogopite and ca2 could spontaneously be substituted into and expand interlayers owing to the competitive adsorption between ca2 and cs ca2 had a relatively strong assisting effect on cs entering interlayers the role of ca2 in interlaminar ion exchange between cs and k was identified to verify the above hypotheses fig 7e f during equilibration the k content of the solution increased mainly due to the release of k from interlayers through replacement by foreign ions the xrd results showed that ca2 was not retained in interlayers revealing that the increase in k content of the solution was mainly due to the substitution of cs consistent with a prior finding indicating that the exchange of dissociative cs for interlaminar k occurred without intermediates luis et al 2017 the amount of cs adsorption was positively correlated with the k content of the solution fig 7e although the basal spacing of biotite exhibited little variation when ca2 was present a positive correlation between adsorbed cs and leached k was still detected therefore ca2 spontaneously promoted the entry of cs into the interlayers of micaceous minerals temperature is another important factor of weathering in nature as shown in fig s1 although negligible variations were observed in the xrd patterns cs adsorption was still elevated at 80 c similar to the effect of ca2 higher temperatures promoted the exchange of dissociative cs for interlaminar k overall the increase in temperature and ca2 content can be concluded to facilitate the diffusion of cs into interlayers by increasing the efficiency of the exchange of cs for k in contrast to the increase in temperature the addition of ca2 spontaneously causes structural expansion and promotes efficient cs fixation within micaceous minerals 4 implications for the long term behavior of rcs in nature the environmental behavior of rcs is greatly influenced by the type and weathering state of micaceous minerals in soils and sediments yin et al 2017 mukai et al 2014 mckinley et al 2004 the results of this study confirmed that fresh biotite and phlogopite have low adsorption capacities for cs and that cs were adsorbed mainly at sites with weak affinity and could be easily replaced by other cations in this case rcs are expected to have high bioavailability and diffusion risk in soils and sediments containing a large amount of weakly weathered micaceous minerals takahashi et al 2017 fan et al 2014b that is the decontamination of rcs should be considerably easier in soils and sediments with a low weathering degree before cs adsorption weathering can lead to interlayer expansion in micaceous minerals such as biotite and phlogopite owing to high temperatures and cation e g ca2 exchange with interlaminar k fig 2 then lead to the creation of more high affinity adsorption sites i e fess and its which can largely improve the fixation of cs on micaceous minerals figs 6 7 and s1 when cs was introduced into the system containing micaceous minerals before and during weathering treatment i e sequences 2 and 3 in fig 1 the structures of biotite and phlogopite negligibly changed whereas the adsorption and fixation of cs significantly improved figs 3 5 and 7 under the influence of weathering the surface species of cs on micaceous minerals gradually transformed from an exchangeable form into a more stable form at collapsed interlayers fig 6 this change revealed that weathering could greatly reduce the mobility and bioavailability of rcs in the environment in areas contaminated with radioactive substances such as fukushima and chernobyl rcs remain the most hazardous radioactive source for several years to a century after the initial contamination owing to their long half life takahashi et al 2017 steinhauser et al 2014 therefore the interactions of rcs soils or sediments with weathering synergistically control the environmental behavior of rcs for a long time regardless of the weathering state of soils or sediments once rcs contamination occurs a pollution removal strategy should be implemented immediately during the period that rcs exist in an exchangeable form otherwise the difficulty and cost of decontamination efforts are likely to increase because the stable species of rcs increase in soil or sediment along with weathering from the perspective of the structural alteration of micaceous minerals regardless of the sequence of cs adsorption and weathering the adsorption of cs can stabilize micaceous mineral structures by collapsing expanded interlayers fig 2 or impeding the structural destruction of biotite and phlogopite during weathering figs 4 and 5 rcs can be firmly fixed in the size compatible hexagonal cavities of the tetrahedral planar sheets of micaceous minerals such as biotite and phlogopite because the radius of cs is similar to the size of the hexagonal cavities in tetrahedral sheets park et al 2019 upon their entry into interlayers rcs stabilize interlayers resulting in good self fixation in practice the influence of drastic rcs contamination on soil and sediment includes the reduction in adsorption sites in micaceous minerals during subsequent weathering leading to the high risk of the migration of rcs to the surrounding environment mckinley et al 2001 high ambient temperature and high concentrations of cations with large hydration radii such as ca2 and mg2 are important weathering factors in complicated natural situations lamarca irisarri et al 2019 yin et al 2017 both factors can facilitate cs diffusion into the interlayers of micaceous minerals by accelerating the cation exchange of foreign ions for interlaminar k ca2 may spontaneously enter and expand micaceous mineral interlayers producing more adsorption sites with strong affinity fig 7d although this study did not detect the structural alterations induced by increases in temperature previous studies have discovered that kinetics and thermodynamics influence substance exchange during hydrothermal treatment yin et al 2018 the combined effect of these factors sharply alters the structure of micaceous minerals and the adsorption of cs in nature ca2 and other cations with large hydration radii e g mg2 are ubiquitous and play an important role in the evolution of micaceous minerals and the environmental behavior of rcs the degree of soil weathering may be higher in warm and humid areas than in cold and dry regions therefore cation composition and soil temperature may result in significant holistic differences in soil and sediment weathering states and rcs migration in addition to the factors mentioned above many weathering factors coexist in nature their interactions are coupled and affect the evolution of soils and sediments and the environmental behavior of rcs the above findings provide an important theoretical basis for effectively evaluating and predicting the migration transformation and spatial distribution of rcs and technical support for the environmental remediation and treatment of areas contaminated with radioactive

14782,the environmental behavior of radioactive cesium rcs in contaminated areas is generally governed by soil and sediment components and natural weathering conditions in this study desorption tests and spectroscopic approaches were used to explore the interaction between the weathering of micaceous minerals i e biotite and phlogopite and the adsorption of cs and the critical role of weathering in the environmental behavior of rcs results showed that the reaction sequence between weathering and cs adsorption significantly affected the surface species of cs and the structure of biotite and phlogopite regardless of whether it occurred before after or during cs adsorption weathering generated more high affinity adsorption sites namely interlayer sites its and frayed edge sites fess to different extents and then facilitated the uptake of cs at fess and its on micaceous minerals in a poorly exchangeable state cs stabilized the micaceous mineral structure once it was absorbed within collapsed interlayers by hindering cation exchange and preventing further destruction during weathering as important weathering factors high temperature and ca2 content promoted the binding of cs in the interlayers of biotite and phlogopite by enhancing interlayer cation exchange these findings are beneficial for a better understanding of the environmental behaviors of rcs in the hydrosphere and pedosphere graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords radiocesium weathering micaceous minerals adsorption cs species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a considerable amount of radioactive cesium rcs has been released into the environment as a result of nuclear accidents weapon tests and possible leakage during the disposal or treatment of radioactive waste e g the leakage of waste tanks in the hanford disposal repository buesseler 2020 steinhauser et al 2014 zachara et al 2002 rcs represent a highly hazardous class of radionuclides owing to their constant gamma radiation emission and long half life 134cs t1 2 2 07 years and 137cs t1 2 30 17 years unterweger et al 1992 given their chemical similarity to alkali metals especially potassium rcs readily migrate in the pedosphere and hydrosphere and progressively accumulate in organisms throughout the food chain kaste et al 2021 numerous previous investigations have suggested that rcs contamination is widespread in various ecosystems e g forests farmland rivers and coastal areas and that its behavior is predominantly controlled by environmental conditions onda et al 2020 takata et al 2020 koarashi et al 2019 micaceous minerals are ubiquitous in soils sediments and suspended particles park et al 2019 zachara et al 2002 the soil surrounding fukushima prefecture has been reported to be abundant in micaceous minerals which have greatly reduced the mobility and bioavailability of rcs in the area takahashi et al 2017 mukai et al 2014 the structure of micaceous minerals consists of one alumina octahedral sheet between two silica tetrahedral sheets schoonheydt et al 2018 these layers are bound together by charge compensating interlaminar k which is weakly hydrated and suitable for occupying the ditrigonal cavities on adjacent sheets a consensus has been reached that at least four types of adsorption sites exist in micaceous minerals for rcs adsorption planar sites pss and type ii sites t2ss which are located on the external basal plane or at the edge of phyllosilicates and present low adsorption affinities for the outer sphere os complexation of hydrated cs and interlayer sites its and frayed edge sites fess which are located at the wedge edge and exhibit strong affinity for the inner sphere is complexation of partially or fully dehydrated cs in ditrigonal cavities or near open edges fan et al 2014a poinssot et al 1999 evans et al 1983 the capacity of each adsorption site is greatly dependent on the type particle size and weathering state of micaceous minerals pss and t2ss are the main contributors to the cation exchange capacity cec of unweathered biotite with a specific degree of fragmentation whereas fess and its have limited contributions kitayama et al 2020 yin et al 2017 the weathering processes of minerals are omnipresent on the earth s sub surface and are consequently significantly influenced by thermal expansion and contraction drying and wetting cycles and salts in the aqueous phase weathering can accelerate cation exchange between interlaminar k and foreign cations causing a variation in basal spacing and affecting cs retention ability for example the intercalation of hydrated na mg2 ca2 and al3 into phlogopite increases the layer spacing from 1 0 nm to 1 5 nm and induces the transformation of phlogopite into a vermiculite like mineral tamura et al 2014 meanwhile the formation of a certain amount of fes at the transition regions between nonexpanded and expanded interlayers enhances the irreversibility of cs binding to micaceous minerals kitayama et al 2020 clearly weathering processes are expected to alter the structure of minerals and the distribution of cs adsorption sites murakami et al 2016 mohanty et al 2014 mckinley et al 2004 generally the final state of micaceous minerals in the environment is always dependent on various simultaneous and coupled weathering processes numerous spectroscopic studies have explored the mechanisms underlying weathering and its effect on cs retention several researches have revealed that weathering can produce more fess and its within micaceous minerals which are beneficial to the adsorption of rcs and largely enhance the retardation of rcs in the environment park et al 2019 fuller et al 2015 mckinley et al 2004 for example fan et al 2014a found that os complexes greatly contributed to cs adsorption on illite whereas almost pure is complexes contribute to cs adsorption on vermiculite moreover park et al 2019 and mckinley et al 2004 reported that cs can be converted into a more stable or irreversible fraction through soil weathering processes from another perspective cs adsorption may affect the structural transformation of micaceous minerals several studies have suggested that these phenomena mainly originate from irreversible cs adsorption and attempts have been made to explain their underlying mechanisms on the basis of relative charge density hydrated radius and hydration energy of cations park et al 2019 fan et al 2014a benedicto et al 2014 tansel et al 2012 fess play an important role in cs fixation in micaceous minerals owing to their special spatial structure fess are more likely to accommodate weakly hydrated cs than cations with a large hydrated radius e g ca2 and mg2 fuller et al 2015 cs has lower hydration energy a smaller hydrated ion radius and a higher charge density than k therefore fess are several orders of magnitude more selective for the adsorption of cs than for k and the selectivity coefficients of cs to k log cs kk is 4 6 at fess park et al 2019 fan and takahashi 2017 lee et al 2017 yin et al 2017 fan et al 2014 cs captured in fess is mainly trapped within the size compatible hexagonal cavities of tetrahedral planar sheets and closely shielded by two adjacent sheets in a thermodynamically stable state readily causing to an interlayer collapse yin et al 2020 lee et al 2017 dzene et al 2015 therefore along with the fixation of cs fess gradually collapse and transform into collapsed interlayer which benefits the fixation of cs on a macroscopic scale after the adsorption and fixation of cs expandable micaceous minerals are indeed transformed into a non expandable structure and a mineral similar to the primary mineral biotite is formed which cannot be re expanded by the hydrated cations fuller et al 2015 considering that weathering is a time dependent and typically slow process micaceous minerals in various states of weathering may exist in a given soil aaron et al 2000 once cs is accidentally leaked into the environment its environmental behavior is determined by the weathering process however most previous studies focused on the adsorption and desorption of cs on unweathered micaceous minerals and did not conduct a clear and systematic analysis of the interactions between the weathering of micaceous minerals and the adsorption of cs yin et al 2020 fuller et al 2015 hyun shik et al 2011 in this study three treatment sequences were designed to explore the mechanism underlying the interaction between cs adsorption and micaceous mineral weathering during the experiments the structural alteration in biotite and phlogopite and the adsorption of cs were analyzed through batch sorption desorption experiments and x ray diffraction xrd to understand how the weathering process regulates the behavior of cs adsorption on micaceous minerals the results of this work can provide practical support for environmental remediation in areas contaminated with radioactive substances and are vital for extending the theoretical basis of cs migration and transformation in the hydrosphere and pedosphere 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials biotite and phlogopite obtained from lingshou county hebei province china were chosen as representative micaceous minerals before the experiments biotite and phlogopite were milled by using a mortar and passed through a 325 mesh sieve in this study cec measurement was conducted in accordance with the method of bradbury 1998 and the cec values of biotite and phlogopite were found to be 12 45 and 25 31 meq 100 g respectively the n2 brunauer emmett and teller specific surface areas of biotite and phlogopite were 5 7 0 3 and 5 3 0 2 m2 g respectively all of the chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and were not subjected to additional treatment before use 2 2 preparation of biotite and phlogopite as shown in fig 1 three treatment sequences for the weathering of micaceous minerals biotite and phlogopite and the adsorption of cs were established to mimic the interplay between micaceous mineral weathering and rcs contamination in nature sequence 1 was a two step treatment representing a scenario in which biotite or phlogopite underwent some weathering before cesium addition in this scenario biotite or phlogopite was successively affected by simulated weathering and cs adsorption in brief 2 5 g of biotite or phlogopite was suspended in 0 25 l of 0 2 mol l cacl2 solution in a temperature controlled water bath at 80 c for 48 h tmaura et al 2014 stout et al 2006 subsequently the suspension was separated by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 30 min and washed several times with milli q water to remove excess ca2 then residual biotite or phlogopite particles were freeze dried for the following adsorption experiment 2 5 g of biotite or phlogopite weathered as described above was dispersed in 0 25 l of 2 0 10 5 4 0 10 3 and 1 6 10 2 mol l cscl solutions then equilibrated in a 25 c incubator shaker for 48 h finally supernatants were filtered and collected through a 0 22 μm membrane for the measurement of cs concentration residual particles were washed with milli q water freeze dried for further characterization and denoted as bio w cs and phl w cs the cs concentrations in solutions were measured through ion chromatography ics 600 thermo fisher usa in sequence 2 fresh biotite or phlogopite was added with cesium and then weathered approximately 2 5 g of biotite or phlogopite was equilibrated with 0 25 l of 2 0 10 5 or 4 0 10 3 mol l cscl solution in a 25 c shaking incubator for 48 h particle separation and cs concentration analysis were performed following adsorption equilibration and were similar to the procedures conducted in sequence 1 then 2 5 g of the saturated biotite or phlogopite sample was suspended in 0 25 l of 0 2 mol l cacl2 solution and weathered in an 80 c water bath for 48 h the procedures for separation and cs concentration analysis were identical to those mentioned above the finally obtained solid samples were collected for subsequent characterization and denoted as bio cs w and phl cs w in sequence 3 weathering and cs adsorption on biotite or phlogopite occurred simultaneously briefly 2 5 g of biotite or phlogopite was dispersed in 0 25 l of a solution containing cacl2 and cscl to examine the role of cs in this system we set two cs concentrations 2 0 10 5 or 4 0 10 3 mol l respectively the concentration of cacl2 is constant to 0 2 mol l the resulting suspensions were then placed in an 80 c water bath for 48 h for adsorption equilibration and weathering the methods for the subsequent separation and cs concentration analysis were the same as those introduced in sequence 1 the obtained samples were denoted as bio w cs and phl w cs given that soils can experience different degrees of cs contamination solutions with various cs concentrations were employed during micaceous mineral treatment the details of the sample preparation and characterization procedures are presented in sections s1 and s2 in the supplementary information during weathering less than 0 6 and 0 2 wt of biotite and phlogopite were dissolved respectively all sample preparation and adsorption desorption tests were conducted in duplicate to acquire sufficient samples and reliable data 2 3 desorption procedure sequential desorption experiments were performed by using a modified semicontinuous approach in accordance with rigol 1999b to identify the cs surface species on micaceous minerals the complete sequential desorption process included five cycles of desorption steps in the first cycle 0 1 g of the prepared sample was dispersed in 5 0 ml of a mixed solution containing 0 01 m nh4cl and 0 01 m nacl then the mixture was shaken in a 25 c incubator for 24 h following equilibration the suspension was separated from the liquid without drying and subsequently directly suspended in a freshly prepared solution of the same composition to complete the next desorption cycle the concentration of cs in every filtrate was quantified to calculate the cs desorption ratio in every single desorption cycle on the basis of the initial adsorption capacity and the overall desorption ratio for each sample was then summed and denoted as fe the residual cs within the solid was regarded as the fraction with low bioavailability fr which can be calculated by subtracting the fe moiety from the total amount that is 100 desorption experiments on biotite phlogopite weathered biotite and weathered phlogopite were conducted as blanks and no cs was detected in the filtrates after the same desorption procedures 2 4 effects of ca2 and temperature given that temperature and ca2 content are the main weathering factors their role in the structural variations in micaceous minerals and the distribution of cs was examined through a batch experiment solutions containing 1 5 10 5 4 5 10 4 m cscl in the comparative system were used to obtain adsorption isotherms and the solid to liquid ratio was set to 1 0 g l specifically for evaluating the effect of ca2 a 0 01 m cacl2 solution was employed as the background electrolyte and a series of tests without the background electrolyte were conducted at room temperature and served as the control the equilibrium temperature was set to 4 0 c and 80 c to investigate the effect of temperature and no extra electrolyte was added to the equilibrium solutions in addition to xrd analysis and isotherm determination the fluctuations in the content of leached k and adsorbed cs during the equilibration process were investigated the ph values of reaction solutions were tested at room temperature before and after sample preparation and the ph of the samples was between 6 8 and 7 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural variations in biotite and phlogopite 3 1 1 weathering before cs adsorption sequence 1 the xrd patterns and assumed structural models of weathered biotite and phlogopite before and after cs adsorption are shown in fig 2 in contrast to unweathered biotite and phlogopite specimens which had a d spacing of 1 01 nm 2θ 8 7 weathered micaceous minerals exhibited a new peak at 5 7 that corresponded to a d spacing of 1 53 nm these results are consistent with previous findings showing that after weathering ca2 can enter and expand interlayers tamura et al 2014 fig 2a illustrates that weathering produced a mixed layer of biotite in which ca2 was partially exchanged for k in biotite and that most interlayers remained closed in contrast to those of biotite the xrd patterns of weathered phlogopite exhibited a strong and sharp peak at 2θ 5 7 fig 2b revealing that phlogopite was considerably more easily weathered than biotite weathering destroyed the attraction of the interlaminar structure to k allowing cations to exchange freely into the phlogopite interlayer structure biotite and phlogopite exhibited significantly different responses to weathering likely due to their different binding affinities for interlayer k and their different chemical compositions in the environment phlogopite tends to exist in its trioctahedral form which readily undergoes depotassication however in most cases biotite is in a dioctahedral form with a high charge density and nonexpansible properties bergaya et al 2006 the excess iron ions in biotite easily isomorphically replace the si atoms in a tetrahedron thus affecting atomic arrangement and improving k binding affinity magnesium rich phlogopite has a lower negative charge density owing to a lack of isomorphic substitution as a result interlaminar k has a smaller attraction force and is more easily replaced in phlogopite than in biotite aaron et al 2000 kalinowski et al 1996 during the subsequent cs adsorption process the xrd feature related to ca2 intercalation 2θ 5 7 progressively diminished as cs concentration increased fig 2 the interlayers expanded by ca2 readily collapsed during cs adsorption causing the interlayer spacing to decrease from 1 53 nm to 1 02 nm thus as reflected by the characteristic peak at 2θ 5 7 fig 2b cs concentration exerted an important effect on interlayer transformation especially in weathered phlogopite the interlayer of the weathered phlogopite required abundant cs 16 0 mm to be occupied whereas that of weathered biotite required only 4 0 mm cs to be occupied these observations indicated that in a natural environment weathering can produce numerous adsorption sites in interlayers with a high fixation potential for rcs given that dehydrated cs is size compatible with hexagonal cavities in si o tetrahedral sheets it can substitute for ca2 fig 2c which is likely to be retained within two adjacent sheets park et al 2019 lee et al 2017 bio w cs and phl w cs samples were weathered again to further validate the effect of cs adsorption on the weathering of micaceous minerals after this process the xrd pattern did not show any apparent changes and the final structures of biotite and phlogopite remained dependent on the amount of cs that had diffused into interlayers figs 2 and 3 in contrast to that of the original biotite and phlogopite fig 2 the weathering of bio w cs and phl w cs samples did not aggravate interlayer expansion fig 3 revealing that ca2 did not enter the interlayers of biotite and phlogopite during the second round of weathering therefore ca2 in the aqueous phase tended to replace k in the original micaceous mineral layers however such a replacement cannot occur after the adsorption of cs under the same weathering conditions the selective adsorption of cs at fess was several orders of magnitude higher than that of ca2 and cs can be firmly held in interlayer hexagonal cavities lee et al 2017 fuller et al 2015 masahiko et al 2013 these results suggested that after cs adsorption the structure of the micaceous minerals becomes more stable and additional weathering does not further change the micaceous mineral structure 3 1 2 weathering after cs adsorption on micaceous minerals sequence 2 different from the above scenario weathering after cs adsorption barely altered the interlayer structure of biotite and phlogopite in contrast to those of phlogopite saturated with 0 02 mm cs the xrd patterns of the mica cs w samples exhibited few noticeable weathering features fig 4 implying that cs adsorption before weathering can strengthen the interlayer structure of micaceous minerals in addition the higher the cs concentration in the saturation solution was the stronger the reinforcement effect was only a small amount of cs can reach the sites around the interlayer margin through mechanically broken channels because biotite and phlogopite are phyllosilicates with low expansion ability the replacement of anhydrous k with cs in interlayers should be limited therefore no significant response in terms of structural alteration occurred after cs saturation was achieved fig 4a b moreover after the adsorption of cs on biotite and phlogopite the entrances to fess and its were occupied by cs and then collapsed to form a stable structure this effect revealed that under the subsequent weathering treatment the channels of fess and its became unavailable to ca2 mainly owing to interlayer collapse after cs adsorption mckinley et al 2001 when the cs concentration of the saturation solution was low cs could not fully occupy all the sites around interlayer entrances although the entrances succumbed to the same weathering treatments and ca2 could enter interlayers the degree of weathering was low 3 1 3 simultaneous weathering and cs adsorption sequence 3 the variations in cs adsorption behavior and biotite or phlogopite structure under simultaneous weathering and cs adsorption were analyzed to understand the circumstances under which cesium addition and weathering jointly affect micaceous minerals such conditions include long term rcs leakage from radionuclide storage tanks in waste repositories mckinley et al 2001 fig 5 a and b illustrates that the structural response of biotite and phlogopite to weathering drastically decreased or completely vanished this effect was related to cs concentration indicating that cs adsorption and weathering can simultaneously induce structural changes the relevant mechanism mainly involved three steps or pathways i cs directly replaced anhydrous k in the interlayer margin positions and occupied the entrance of interlayers thus hindering the entry of other ions ii weathering treatment increased ca2 content and temperature might have facilitated the entry of cs into interlayers under warm conditions ca2 opened interlayers which is a prerequisite for the smooth and free entry of cs into interlayers subsequently cs and ca2 competed for adsorption sites in interlayers and most ca2 ions were ultimately expelled iii given that the low cs content 2 0 10 5 m in the solution was insufficient to replace all ca2 in interlayers the easily weathered phlogopite underwent mild weathering fig 5b therefore in terms of the above three sequences the adsorption of cs improved the stability of micaceous minerals and increased their resistance to weathering through different pathways 3 2 speciation of cs during different treatment sequences a series of semicontinuous desorption with na nh4 solution were conducted to explore the behavior of cs adsorption on biotite and phlogopite table s1 after five desorption cycles the residual cs in micaceous minerals probably bind at sites with strong affinity therefore it was difficult to replace and had low bioavailability fig 6 a shows that after saturation the cs adsorption capacity of biotite reached 6 04 mg g and 65 of the adsorbed cs could be desorbed during the subsequent weathering treatment some cs desorbed from biotite i e the bio cs w sample and the amount of cs remaining in the solid phase decreased to 3 30 mg g indicating that 79 of the adsorbed cs existed in the residual fraction fig 6a in addition the residual fraction of cs in biotite increased from 2 11 mg g to 2 61 mg g after weathering these findings revealed that channels into the inner layers were lacking because the fresh micaceous minerals had not yet been weathered yet thus the majority of cs adsorbed on external sites and easily desorbed although successive weathering no longer induced a detectable change in the structures of micaceous minerals fig 4 weathering following cs adsorption resulted in the increased conversion of cs into the residual fraction this finding is consistent with the aging effect of cs reported by previous studies that is cs tends to constantly seek adsorption sites with strong affinity e g fess and iss during weathering rigol et al 1999a absalom et al 1999 comans et al 1991 accordingly this study further confirmed the conjecture that the adsorption of cs on sites with strong affinity can improve the weathering resistance of micaceous minerals the bio w cs sample exhibited higher cs adsorption capacity up to 11 25 mg g and fixation residual fraction up to 55 than the bio cs w and biotite samples revealing that in the absence of the hindrance of interlayer collapse abundant external and internal adsorption sites formed during the advanced weathering treatment xrd patterns in fig 2 compared with the original biotite sample the bio w cs sample exhibited a considerable increase in cs adsorption i e from 6 04 mg g to 10 0 mg g and the synergistic effects of weathering and cs adsorption accounted for the largest proportion of poorly desorbed cs up to 83 fig 6a these results suggested that the co occurrence of weathering and cs adsorption enhances the adsorption of cs in interlayers generally weathering maximized the structural alteration in micaceous minerals fig 2 and generated more adsorption sites with strong affinity ultimately resulting in higher cs adsorption capacity and a high proportion of the residual fraction fig 6 although the bio w cs sample showed little change in its cs adsorption capacity it had higher relative ratio 83 and absolute concentration 8 3 mg g of poorly desorbed cs than the bio w cs sample likely due to the combined results of the following processes i owing to the weathering resistance of biotite only a limited amount of biotite interlayers could be expanded during weathering fig 2c cs ions that entered firstly into the interlayers collapsed interlayers and obstructed the entry of subsequent cs ions thus reducing the adsorption of cs and the proportion of the residual fraction mckinley et al 2001 ii high temperature may have accelerated ion exchange between k and foreign ions such as ca2 and cs in the bio w cs sample allowing more ca2 and cs to enter interlayers fig 5c lamarca irisarri et al 2019 white et al 1999 iii given that cs and ca2 coexisted during the bio w cs experiments competitive adsorption inevitably occurred particularly at external sites in contrast to that on the original biotite the adsorption of cs on phlogopite exhibited strong irreversibility fig 6b this difference may be due to the chemical compositions and weathering resistances of biotite and phlogopite aaron et al 2000 kalinowski et al 1996 as a trioctahedral micaceous mineral phlogopite exhibits a lower binding affinity for interlaminar k than biotite and is subject to expansion thus it is prone to generating more interlayer adsorption sites fig 2b shows that phlogopite was more easily weathered leading to the generation of more adsorption sites with strong affinity compared with the original phlogopite sample the phl cs w sample exhibited a minor decrease in cs adsorption from 21 51 mg g to 17 93 mg g revealing that cs could not be efficiently desorbed during weathering at higher temperatures and ca2 concentrations the uptake and poorly desorbed percentage of cs in the phl w cs 31 75 mg g and 89 and phl w cs 86 29 mg g and 94 samples were higher than those in the phlogopite sample 21 51 mg g and 76 the phl w cs sample exhibited a higher cs adsorption amount and a lower desorption proportion than the phl w cs sample the xrd patterns fig 2b showed that the interlayer splaying of phlogopite was more extensive than that of biotite and the weathering characteristic peak 2θ 5 7 of phlogopite decreased slowly as the cs concentration increased additional quantities of cs were needed to make the characteristic peak disappear the weathered phlogopite contained extensive interlaminar channels for efficient k leaching and cs adsorption that reduced the self inhibiting effect of cs cs adsorbs on biotite and phlogopite mainly at fess its t2ss and pss however biotite and phlogopite have different it and fes capacities owing to their different charge densities and expansibilities resulting in the different species and behaviors of cs although the reaction sequence of cs adsorption and weathering influenced cs adsorption behavior and biotite and phlogopite structures weathering promoted the exchange of interlayer cations and the residual fraction of cs increased to a certain degree regardless of whether weathering occurred after or during cs adsorption cs strengthened micaceous mineral interlayers and hindered the weathering deterioration process owing to its stabilizing effect when retained in interlayers 3 3 roles of temperature and ca2 in the entry of cs into interlayers as a consequence of sequential desorption fig 6 the amounts of adsorbed cs and residual cs fraction increased with the increase in temperature and ca2 content taking biotite as an example fig 6a the presence of 0 2 m ca2 solution increased cs adsorption from 6 04 mg g to 8 95 mg g and the residual fraction of cs on biotite increased by 44 for the bio cs ca sample at 80 c cs adsorption on biotite increased from 6 04 mg g to 8 42 mg g and the residual cs fraction reached 53 these findings revealed that in nature higher temperatures and ca2 contents could facilitate cs adsorption and diffusion into biotite and phlogopite interlayers more cs ions were present in the form of residual fractions in the bio cs ca sample 79 than in the bio cs 80 c sample 53 moreover the adsorption capacity and fixation of cs on biotite and phlogopite were higher under the combined effect of these two factors mica w cs fig 6 given that cs is generally believed to be well fixed in micaceous mineral interlayers and is difficult to be substituted by other cations micaceous mineral interlayers open up under warm and ca2 rich conditions the adsorption isotherms fig 7 a b c showed that the cs adsorption capacities of biotite and phlogopite increased at higher ca2 contents the xrd patterns revealed that in the control sample the basal spacing of phlogopite was invariable under the infiltration of deionized water blue line in fig 7d a faint peak appeared at 2θ 5 7 after ca2 saturation red line in fig 7d however when phlogopite was equilibrated in the solution containing cs and ca2 the peak reflecting ca2 insertion into the interlayers disappeared black line in fig 7d this finding revealed that the diffusion of water molecules is not the root cause of the interlayer expansion of phlogopite and ca2 could spontaneously be substituted into and expand interlayers owing to the competitive adsorption between ca2 and cs ca2 had a relatively strong assisting effect on cs entering interlayers the role of ca2 in interlaminar ion exchange between cs and k was identified to verify the above hypotheses fig 7e f during equilibration the k content of the solution increased mainly due to the release of k from interlayers through replacement by foreign ions the xrd results showed that ca2 was not retained in interlayers revealing that the increase in k content of the solution was mainly due to the substitution of cs consistent with a prior finding indicating that the exchange of dissociative cs for interlaminar k occurred without intermediates luis et al 2017 the amount of cs adsorption was positively correlated with the k content of the solution fig 7e although the basal spacing of biotite exhibited little variation when ca2 was present a positive correlation between adsorbed cs and leached k was still detected therefore ca2 spontaneously promoted the entry of cs into the interlayers of micaceous minerals temperature is another important factor of weathering in nature as shown in fig s1 although negligible variations were observed in the xrd patterns cs adsorption was still elevated at 80 c similar to the effect of ca2 higher temperatures promoted the exchange of dissociative cs for interlaminar k overall the increase in temperature and ca2 content can be concluded to facilitate the diffusion of cs into interlayers by increasing the efficiency of the exchange of cs for k in contrast to the increase in temperature the addition of ca2 spontaneously causes structural expansion and promotes efficient cs fixation within micaceous minerals 4 implications for the long term behavior of rcs in nature the environmental behavior of rcs is greatly influenced by the type and weathering state of micaceous minerals in soils and sediments yin et al 2017 mukai et al 2014 mckinley et al 2004 the results of this study confirmed that fresh biotite and phlogopite have low adsorption capacities for cs and that cs were adsorbed mainly at sites with weak affinity and could be easily replaced by other cations in this case rcs are expected to have high bioavailability and diffusion risk in soils and sediments containing a large amount of weakly weathered micaceous minerals takahashi et al 2017 fan et al 2014b that is the decontamination of rcs should be considerably easier in soils and sediments with a low weathering degree before cs adsorption weathering can lead to interlayer expansion in micaceous minerals such as biotite and phlogopite owing to high temperatures and cation e g ca2 exchange with interlaminar k fig 2 then lead to the creation of more high affinity adsorption sites i e fess and its which can largely improve the fixation of cs on micaceous minerals figs 6 7 and s1 when cs was introduced into the system containing micaceous minerals before and during weathering treatment i e sequences 2 and 3 in fig 1 the structures of biotite and phlogopite negligibly changed whereas the adsorption and fixation of cs significantly improved figs 3 5 and 7 under the influence of weathering the surface species of cs on micaceous minerals gradually transformed from an exchangeable form into a more stable form at collapsed interlayers fig 6 this change revealed that weathering could greatly reduce the mobility and bioavailability of rcs in the environment in areas contaminated with radioactive substances such as fukushima and chernobyl rcs remain the most hazardous radioactive source for several years to a century after the initial contamination owing to their long half life takahashi et al 2017 steinhauser et al 2014 therefore the interactions of rcs soils or sediments with weathering synergistically control the environmental behavior of rcs for a long time regardless of the weathering state of soils or sediments once rcs contamination occurs a pollution removal strategy should be implemented immediately during the period that rcs exist in an exchangeable form otherwise the difficulty and cost of decontamination efforts are likely to increase because the stable species of rcs increase in soil or sediment along with weathering from the perspective of the structural alteration of micaceous minerals regardless of the sequence of cs adsorption and weathering the adsorption of cs can stabilize micaceous mineral structures by collapsing expanded interlayers fig 2 or impeding the structural destruction of biotite and phlogopite during weathering figs 4 and 5 rcs can be firmly fixed in the size compatible hexagonal cavities of the tetrahedral planar sheets of micaceous minerals such as biotite and phlogopite because the radius of cs is similar to the size of the hexagonal cavities in tetrahedral sheets park et al 2019 upon their entry into interlayers rcs stabilize interlayers resulting in good self fixation in practice the influence of drastic rcs contamination on soil and sediment includes the reduction in adsorption sites in micaceous minerals during subsequent weathering leading to the high risk of the migration of rcs to the surrounding environment mckinley et al 2001 high ambient temperature and high concentrations of cations with large hydration radii such as ca2 and mg2 are important weathering factors in complicated natural situations lamarca irisarri et al 2019 yin et al 2017 both factors can facilitate cs diffusion into the interlayers of micaceous minerals by accelerating the cation exchange of foreign ions for interlaminar k ca2 may spontaneously enter and expand micaceous mineral interlayers producing more adsorption sites with strong affinity fig 7d although this study did not detect the structural alterations induced by increases in temperature previous studies have discovered that kinetics and thermodynamics influence substance exchange during hydrothermal treatment yin et al 2018 the combined effect of these factors sharply alters the structure of micaceous minerals and the adsorption of cs in nature ca2 and other cations with large hydration radii e g mg2 are ubiquitous and play an important role in the evolution of micaceous minerals and the environmental behavior of rcs the degree of soil weathering may be higher in warm and humid areas than in cold and dry regions therefore cation composition and soil temperature may result in significant holistic differences in soil and sediment weathering states and rcs migration in addition to the factors mentioned above many weathering factors coexist in nature their interactions are coupled and affect the evolution of soils and sediments and the environmental behavior of rcs the above findings provide an important theoretical basis for effectively evaluating and predicting the migration transformation and spatial distribution of rcs and technical support for the environmental remediation and treatment of areas contaminated with radioactive

standard methods 9260 legionella method and iso method 11731 apha 2012 cdc 2006 iso 2017 these methods offer several sample collection approaches sample processing options obligatory media choices and backend approaches to identify presumptive legionella colonies throughout each culture method process the analyst must make many decisions and assumptions on the collection and processing of the samples in 2017 legiolert a new commercial product entered the market for l pneumophila determination the legiolert test significantly simplifies the front end assumptions and decisions necessary for culture analysis legiolert is a powder containing a substrate and antibiotics that is added to the water sample if l pneumophila is present the water becomes turbid light to dark brown indicating l pneumophila growth however the legiolert test reagent can cross react with other water bacteria such as brevundimonas spp elizabethkingia meningoseptica pseudomonas aeruginosa proteus mirabilis serratia marcescens ochrobactrum spp and stenotrophomonas spp hirsh et al 2021 lechevallier 2019 culture methods including legiolert are susceptible to biological and chemical inhibitors in the water studies by toze et al 1990 and donohue 2021 have shown heterotrophic bacteria can suppress legionella spp and l pneumophila growth high heterotrophic bacterial counts can decrease l pneumophila concentrations this can cause the l pneumophila concentrations to fall below the culture method s limit of detection lod instructions for the legiolert 100 ml test indicate results could be impacted if the water s hardness is either too low or too high thus additional additive is needed to minimize the hardness interference the performance issues with the legionella culture methods resulted in the development and use of molecular methods such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr molecular techniques target highly microbe specific dna or rna sequences to identify and quantify the presence of the microorganism these molecular methods have higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional culture based methods in addition molecular methods are highly tolerant of the sample s water quality however a challenge with molecular methods such as qpcr is they can detect live and dead cells the objective of this research project was to assess three culture methods bcye culture with maldi ms identification donohue 2021 the legiolert 10 ml test the legiolert 100 ml test and one qpcr assay for l pneumophila determination water samples from buildings homes and office buildings were examined by all four methods the performance of each method was assessed against the samples water quality to determine if specific water quality characteristics influenced l pneumophila determination additionally a legionella genus qpcr assay was used to determine the water quality variables that promote or hinder legionella spp occurrence the genus assay helped understand the l pneumophila results in the context of the total amount of legionella within a sample 2 material and methods 2 1 samples in 2017 2019 water samples n 209 from across the us were collected at cold and hot distal taps within homes and office buildings the homes and buildings in this study had no known legionella spp contamination at each tap the water was turned on and after a 15 s flush the water was collected into three 1 l bottles one of the three bottles contained 0 030 mg l sodium thiosulfate to quench chlorine residuals for the culture work the water was collected successively in the three 1 l bottles the bottle with sodium thiosulfate was always collected first this sequence is important because microbial concentrations can fluctuate from one liter to the next during the first 5 min of flow from the tap a limitation of this study design is that the water used for the culture methods was from the bottle with sodium thiosulfate but the water used for the molecular methods and the water quality evaluations were from the bottles without sodium thiosulfate after the water was collected the filled bottles were placed into a cooler with ice packs and shipped overnight to the us epa in cincinnati oh 2 2 sample processing fig 1 a shows the sample processing and analysis flowchart the water in the two one liter bottles without sodium thiosulfate were vacuum filtered for qpcr testing and the remaining one liter bottle with sodium thiosulfate was used for all the culture testings 2 3 water quality eight water quality variables were studied including source water type secondary disinfectant total chlorine residual heterotrophic bacteria total organic carbon ph water hardness cold and hot water lines the water quality variables were always measured using water from the second 1 l bottle the only exception was the hpc test which was done on water from the first 1 l bottle containing sodium thiosulfate the eight water quality variables were segmented into 28 categories based on scale and ranges and method performance was evaluated in each of these categories 2 3 1 ph total chlorine and water hardness a sample s ph total chlorine and hardness were measured immediately upon its arrival at the epa facility a calibrated ph meter was used to measure the ph of the water hanna instruments woonsocket ri total chlorine was measured in a 10 ml volume using the n n diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd method a 5 ml aliquot was used to measure hardness using the hach 5b hardness test kit hach company loveland co all manufacturer s instructions were followed 2 3 2 total organic carbon a 40 ml water aliquot was acidified with 2 m hydrochloric acid a 35 ml volume of the acidified sample was sparged for 12 min for the total organic carbon toc determination a 150 µl sparged sample was injected into a shimadzu toc l instrument shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md a toc value was calculated by averaging the resulting peak area and comparing it to a standard curve generated using the national institute of standards and technology nist potassium hydrogen phthalate khp standard the toc standard curve must be linear and have a r2 of 0 99 for toc determination 2 3 3 heterotrophic plate counts hpc on the day of sample arrival standard methods 9215b was used to enumerate the heterotrophic bacteria the water sample bottle containing sodium thiosulfate was briefly shaken 100 µl aliquots of water were spread plated on bd difco r2a agar plates bd franklin lake nj in duplicate the plates were incubated at 25 c for seven days the colony forming units cfu were counted and recorded on day seven the limit of detection was 10 cfu per ml 2 4 legionella pneumophila methods the culture methods chosen for this study were bcye culture with maldi ms identification donohue 2021 the legiolert 10 ml test and the legiolert 100 ml test the l pneumophila lp16s qpcr assay was selected for its ability to detect and enumerate l pneumophila in diverse water samples source water distribution storage tank and in premise plumbing donohue et al 2014 king et al 2016 the legionella genus qpcr assay targets the ssra gene and has been used by government agencies us cdc and uk health security agency as a reliable method for legionella spp determination benitez and winchell 2013 collins et al 2015 the legionella spp qpcr assay was used to confirm l pneumophila culture positive samples culture negative samples and to be a secondary method to confirm l pneumophila qpcr positive samples 2 4 1 culture methods 2 4 1 1 bcye culture with maldi ms identification on the day the samples arrived a 100 ml aliquot from the bottle containing sodium thiosulfate was vacuum filtered through a 0 2 µm supor 200 membrane pall life sciences port washington ny after filtration the membrane was aseptically transferred using sterile forceps to a 5 ml macrocentrifuge tube celltreat scientific products pepperell ma containing 5 ml sterile water and was vortexed with three 30 s pulses 100 µl suspensions from the resulting concentrate were spread plated on buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye and glycine vancomycin polymyxin cycloheximide gvpc agar plates becton dickinson and company sparks md the plates were incubated inverted at 35 c for 7 days the number of colonies chosen one to three were picked based on morphology gray white color convex and smooth surface iso 2017 for maldi ms analysis the theoretical limit of detection for culture is 0 5 cfu per ml bacterial identification was performed using bruker biotyper maldi ms instrument donohue 2021 2 4 1 2 legiolert after the 1 l sample bottle with sodium thiosulfate was briefly shaken 5 s 10 ml and 100 ml aliquots of water were removed for analysis the manufacturer s instructions were followed for the 10 ml test 10 ml of sample and 90 ml of sterile water were combined for the 100 ml test no additional water was added for each 100 ml sample final volume contents of a legiolert idexx laboratories westbrook me blister pack was added and mixed until granules dissolved following the manufacturer s instructions an additive was added if the water sample hardness was too low or too high next the resulting light yellow liquid was poured into a legiolert quanti tray and sealed the trays were incubated at 39 c for seven days the results were read and recorded on day seven one hundred ml of sterile water was used as the negative control and processed alongside the unknown samples the legiolert assay has a theoretical limit of detection of 0 01 most probable number mpn per ml the liquid from positive wells was used for secondary confirmation testing 2 4 2 qpcr the qpcr procedures for water filtration dna extraction assay conditions and instrument setup and qpcr data interpretations were previously published donohue et al 2014 and a full description was placed in the supplemental file briefly 2 l of water was vacuum filtered through a polycarbonate membrane dna was extracted from the microbes captured on the membrane and the dna was analyzed using qpcr assays for legionella spp and l pneumophila 2 5 methods for confirming presumptive l pneumophila culture positive results the approaches used to confirm presumptive l pneumophila colonies and liquid are shown in fig 1b presumptive colonies from agar plates were identified as l pneumophila by maldi ms to confirm l pneumophila presence in positive legiolert tests the turbid liquid was aseptically removed from the quanti tray and pipetted into a 5 ml macrocentrifuge tube next the presence of l pneumophila was confirmed using maldi ms subculture on bcye and blood agar plates bap and qpcr the procedure used for each method is explained in the supplemental material 2 6 data interpretation a true positive sample was defined as a sample with a positive l pneumophila result by any of the primary methods and confirmed by any secondary methods a true negative sample was defined as a sample that was negative for l pneumophila using all the primary methods a false positive sample was defined as a sample that was positive by only one primary method and the result could not be confirmed by any of the other methods a false negative sample was a sample that was negative by one of the primary methods but was positive by two or more of the other methods sensitivity for each approach was calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the total true positive false negative samples multiplied by 100 specificity for each approach was calculated by dividing the number of true negative samples by the total false positive true negative samples multiplied by 100 positive predictive values ppv were calculated by dividing the number of true positive samples by the total true positive false positive samples multiplied by 100 negative predictive values npv were calculated by dividing the number of true negative samples by the total false negative true negative samples multiplied by 100 accuracy was calculated by adding true positive true negative samples divided by the total true positive false positive false negative true negative samples multiplied by 100 the analysis shown in fig 3 was performed as follows for each water quality variable e g source water the true positive and false positive samples were distributed within the respective categories e g surface water and groundwater next each category s true positives and false positives were added to find the total within that category then the true positive and false positive percentages were calculated for each category 2 7 statistical analysis percentage mean and median were calculated in microsoft excel microsoft corporation redmond wa fisher exact test and chi square analysis were performed in sigmaplot 14 0 systat software inc san jose ca a statistical significance level of 0 05 was used 3 results 3 1 l pneumophila method performance metrics l pneumophila positive detection frequency ranged from 2 22 in this study depending on the method table 1 the legiolert 10 ml procedure had the lowest detection frequency of 2 4 209 and the qpcr lp16s assay had the highest detection frequency of 22 46 209 the qpcr lp16s detection frequency was significantly greater than all the culture detection frequencies x 2 p 0 001 the detection frequencies among the culture methods were not statistically significant table 1 shows the sample volume tested by each method the number of true positive true negative false positive and false negative samples for each method and the method performance metrics sensitivity specificity positive and negative predictive values and accuracy the culture methods specificity values were in the 91 100 range the legiolert 100 ml test had the lower specificity of 91 while the bcye culture with maldi ms identification exhibited a specificity of 100 the sensitivity of culture methods ranged from 9 21 surprisingly the legiolert tests had a low positive predictive value ppv of 40 the ppv for bcye culture with maldi ms identification was 100 this higher ppv was a consequence of using maldi ms for bacterial identification among the culture methods the bcye culture with maldi ms identification had the highest accuracy of 80 in contrast the qpcr lp16s assay s parameters of sensitivity specificity ppv npv and accuracy were 94 3 2 water quality impact on l pneumophila detection fig 2 shows l pneumophila true positives and detection frequencies in eight water quality variables and the respective 28 categories using culture and molecular methods the eight water quality variables evaluated were source water type water hardness total organic carbon toc total chlorine tcl secondary disinfectant ph heterotrophic bacteria cold and hot water lines this analysis helped identify water quality conditions that could promote or hinder the detection of l pneumophila in water using culture methods the highest l pneumophila detection frequencies were in surface water hard water 61 120 mg l water with toc in the 1 2 mg l range water with a tcl concentration in the 0 2 0 5 mg cl2 l range chlorinated water water with ph 8 5 water with heterotrophic bacteria in the 0 9 cfu ml range and cold water lines the l pneumophila qpcr assay detection frequency was similar for surface water and groundwater sources and samples from cold and hot water lines interestingly chloramine disinfected water had significantly higher l pneumophila detection frequency of 43 21 49 than chlorine treated water s 16 25 160 x 2 p 0 001 within the water hardness categories l pneumophila qpcr detection frequency was highest in moderately hard water at 28 19 67 l pneumophila qpcr detection frequencies positively correlated with toc and heterotrophic bacterial counts as toc and heterotrophic bacteria increased so did l pneumophila detection frequency higher l pneumophila detections were observed in water with a ph 8 1 8 5 and ph 8 5 most l pneumophila detections occurred in samples with a total chlorine concentration of 0 5 mg cl2 l and 1 1 mg cl2 l the l pneumophila detection frequencies in total chlorine categories demonstrated a bimodal distribution this bimodal distribution is probably due to secondary disinfectant influences and is being explored further 3 3 confirmatory testing several approaches were employed to confirm whether a colony or well legiolert liquid was positive for l pneumophila fig 1b the bcye culture with maldi ms identification yielded six samples with presumptive l pneumophila colonies those isolates were identified by morphology gray white color convex and smooth surface iso 2017 and confirmed as l pneumophila using maldi ms for bacterial identification thirty five legiolert tests 10 ml and 100 ml had presumptive positive wells where the liquid turned turbid light dark brown maldi ms confirmed l pneumophila in 29 10 35 of the tests in addition to maldi ms analysis the positive liquid was subcultured onto bcye and bap agar plates by bcye subculturing l pneumophila was recovered from the positive liquid in 29 10 35 of samples these samples were the ones also confirmed by maldi ms the 25 remaining legiolert tests that did not yield a confirmatory l pneumophila isolate by subculturing were tested using the qpcr method quantitative pcr confirmed the presence of l pneumophila in four additional tests 16 4 25 l pneumophila recovery by bcye subculturing and maldi ms identification was hindered by the presence of other bacteria pseudomonas spp acinetobacter spp and other unidentified bacteria determined by maldi ms these bacteria grew faster on the media and potentially outcompeted the l pneumophila 3 4 l pneumophila primary methods true positives and false positives by water quality variables the true positive tp to false positive fp ratios were calculated to identify water qualities where l pneumophila tests performed well or underperformed fig 3 fig 3 shows the tp fp ratio for each method in each of the 28 water quality categories the ratios were converted to percentages in order to simplify and visualize the data a good designation was assigned to the combination of water qualities and tests with a tp fp ratio 0 6 60 the unclear designation was assigned to the combination of water qualities and tests with a tp fp ratio between 0 4 0 6 40 60 the combination of water qualities and tests designated as poor had a tp fp ratio of 0 4 40 samples with no data no true positives or false positives were designated as unknown nk among the 28 water quality categories examined the bcye culture with maldi ms identification had fifteen water quality categories where the tp fp ratio was good 60 bcye culture with maldi ms identification produced no false positives 0 28 species identification by maldi ms allowed for this performance legiolert 10 ml and 100 ml tests performed well with a good tp fp ratio 60 in five and three water quality categories respectively the legiolert 10 ml test performed well in surface water hard water water with 0 9 cfu ml of heterotrophic bacteria and at two ph ranges 7 1 7 5 and 8 6 the legiolert 100 ml test performed well in surface water hard water water with 0 9 cfu ml of heterotrophic bacteria however the 100 ml test tp fp ratios declined compared to the 10 ml test these results suggest the legiolert 10 ml test where the 10 ml sample is diluted with 90 ml sterile water helped enhance the method s performance by diluting potential inhibitors in the sample that obstruct legiolert s color reaction also the legiolert 10 ml and 100 ml tests had 12 and 15 water quality categories respectively where the tp fp ratio was 40 which put them in the poor designation the 28 water quality categories tested did not influence qpcr detection of l pneumophila as indicated by the true positive to false positive ratios fig 3 3 5 water quality categories that support legionella spp detection the legionella genus qpcr assay revealed the water quality conditions that support legionella spp detection fig 4 shows legionella spp detection in the 28 water quality categories legionella spp detection frequencies within source water types and water line types were similar within the water hardness categories moderately hard water 61 120 mg l had the highest detection frequency for legionella spp 61 41 67 interestingly chloramine treated water had a significantly higher legionella spp detection frequency of 73 36 46 compared to chlorine treated water at 41 66 160 x 2 p 0 001 higher legionella spp detection frequencies trended with higher heterotrophic bacterial counts and toc samples with a total chlorine concentration of 0 to 0 1 mg cl2 l and 1 1 mg cl2 l had the highest positive detection frequencies for legionella spp within the chlorine ranges detection of legionella spp was influenced by the ph two ph ranges 7 1 7 5 and 8 1 8 5 were observed to have the highest legionella spp detection total chlorine and ph s bimodal distributions suggest the secondary disinfectant choice may influence legionella spp detection frequency chloraminated water retained a higher total chlorine residual avg 1 6 mg cl2 l and higher ph avg 8 2 than the chlorinated water with total chlorine residual avg 0 5 mg cl2 l and ph avg 7 8 3 6 relationship between legionella spp and l pneumophila fig 5 shows the relationship between legionella spp and l pneumophila in source water disinfectant categories the categories were surface water chlorine n 98 surface water chloramine n 39 groundwater chloramine n 10 and groundwater chlorine n 62 legionella spp was detected in 102 samples in this study legionella spp highest detection rate of 80 8 10 was in groundwater chloramine samples followed by surface water chloramine at 72 28 39 surface water chlorine at 43 42 98 and groundwater chlorine at 39 24 62 additionally fig 5 shows which samples were l pneumophila positive by method type among four source water disinfectant categories an estimated l pneumophila percentage of the total legionella spp was calculated using the two qpcr results l p in figure 5 values are in parenthesis fig 5 shows that not every legionella spp positive sample was also positive for l pneumophila in fact by qpcr l pneumophila was only detected in 45 46 102 of the positive legionella spp samples this figure also shows how water quality may affect the l pneumophila percentage within the total legionella spp population in surface water chlorine by qpcr it was estimated that l pneumophila represented on average 48 average of the l p of the total legionella spp population in surface water chlorine the culture methods detected l pneumophila when l pneumophila represented 45 100 of the total legionella spp population for the water quality types of groundwater chlorine surface water chloramine and groundwater chloramine by qpcr l pneumophila represented on average 32 15 and 7 average l p of the total legionella spp population respectively in these other water quality types culture methods did not detect l pneumophila except 1 sample these results suggest the sample s source water disinfectant combination influences the proportion of legionella spp that is l pneumophila in chloramine treated water surface or ground water more samples were positive for legionella spp compared to chlorine treated water however in chloramine treated water the proportion of l pneumophila within the legionella spp population was low compared to chlorine treated water this data suggests more research is needed to understand the risk and tradeoffs associated with disinfectant choices this analysis also suggests culture methods need higher concentrations of l pneumophila among the total legionella spp population to perform well in these source water disinfectant categories 4 discussion the us drinking water supply is not uniform in its water quality many areas of the us encounter source and potable water quality challenges such as drought related changes in hardness ph and toc brackish and nutrient rich water arsenic and manganese contamination dieter et al 2018 these water quality challenges can substantially increase the treatment effort needed to provide clean and safe drinking water to communities therefore drinking water methods must be sensitive specific and robust in a wide range of water quality types a method is a systematic approach by which a component is qualitatively or quantitatively measured the performance of a method is measured by several factors such as sensitivity specificity the limit of detection the limit of quantification dynamic range and robustness this study examined three culture methods and one qpcr method for detecting l pneumophila in potable water collected from homes and office buildings with no known legionella contamination 4 1 l pneumophila culture methods this study s l pneumophila culture detection frequency of 2 5 table 1 in homes and buildings is comparable to the 5 8 in premise plumbing and hospital samples reported by mccuin et al 2021 and 2 11 in distribution water samples reported by lechevallier 2018 2019 this study s l pneumophila culture detection frequency is similar to the 6 14 218 detection frequency in homes that stout et al 1992 reported over 30 years ago it is interesting to note that the l pneumophila culture detection frequency in homes has not changed substantially in 30 years although legionellosis cases have increased 9 fold over the same time period barskey et al 2022 this observation suggests several possible scenarios first for example culture methods are not sensitive enough to accurately detect l pneumophila occurrence in all drinking water qualities second if l pneumophila occurrence has remained the same then increased exposure to aerosols or new exposure routes have developed third l pneumophila strains have become more virulent causing higher infection rates david et al 2016 wee et al 2021 however other studies have reported higher l pneumophila culture detection frequencies including 14 by petrisek and hall 2018 30 by scaturro et al 2020 51 57 by spies et al 2018 and 85 by boczek et al 2021 a close examination of the sample types in these studies indicates a higher likelihood of l pneumophila contamination for example some of these studies focused on a l pneumophila contaminated pilot scale in premise plumbing system or hot water heaters therefore it is vital to understand the sample type l pneumophila contaminated or not and the purpose of the sampling general environmental monitoring treatment challenge testing or determination of the source of a legionellosis case because these variables and choices can inflate or deflate our understanding of l pneumophila s environmental occurrence in this study the bcye culture with maldi ms identification had a false positive rate of 0 this low false positive rate was due to the accuracy of maldi ms identification trnkova et al 2018 the legiolert 10 ml and 100 ml culture tests had a 3 6 209 and 7 15 209 false positive rate respectively if only surface water samples were considered then the false positive rate for the legiolert 10 and 100 ml tests drop to 1 1 135 and 4 5 135 respectively these rates are comparable to the 0 5 5 rates reported in previous surface water studies lechevallier 2018 sartory et al 2017 on the other hand if only groundwater samples were considered in this study then the false positive rate for the legiolert 10 ml and 100 ml tests increases to 7 5 74 and 14 10 74 respectively there are many possible explanations for the legiolert s higher false positive rate in groundwater samples the proprietary legiolert test relies on l pneumophila expressing an enzyme that reacts with a substrate to initiate a color reaction it is possible the groundwater environment and its chemical properties are enhancing the substrate color reaction or promoting the expression of the enzyme in other bacterial species resulting in false positives it is possible this study s samples had a higher occurrence of waterborne bacterial fauna such as brevundimonas spp elizabethkingia meningoseptica pseudomonas aeruginosa proteus mirabilis serratia marcescens ochrobactrum spp and stenotrophomonas spp which are known to cross react with the legiolert test hirsh et al 2021 lechevallier 2019 in fact during bcye and bap confirmation testing of legiolert positive samples pseudomonas spp and stenotrophomonas spp were routinely identified from the legiolert positive liquid using maldi ms recently during a legionellosis outbreak investigation the legiolert 100 ml test was used to identify the source of l pneumophila unfortunately all the legiolert 100 ml positive tests were false positives the color reaction was not due to l pneumophila but due to pseudomonas spp and proteus spp fugitt 2018 another potential explanation is that this study s sample set contained more water quality diversity including more groundwater samples than samples used in other published studies for example of the articles that reported water type lechevallier s 2018 2019 samples were mainly surface water and boczek et al 2021 samples were from a pilot scale in premise plumbing system that received chlorinated surface water in a controlled environment 4 2 the impact of water quality on l pneumophila culture determination understanding the impact of water quality on l pneumophila determination is a unique aspect of this study fig 3 shows the true positive to false positive ratios for the l pneumophila methods under all the water quality categories studied water quality did not affect the bcye culture with maldi ms identification based on the true positive to false positive ratios the bcye culture with maldi ms identification is a procedure where the bacteria are removed from the water matrix and therefore the sample s water chemistry has a minimal impact also picking single colonies from the agar plates and identifying them using an accurate maldi ms technique that is largely immune to water quality influences makes this approach more robust and applicable to a wide range of water qualities water quality affected the legiolert tests the dilution of a sample s water quality in the legiolert 10 ml test relatively improved the test s true positive to false positive ratio compared to the 100 ml test where the sample was not diluted for some water qualities fig 3 the legiolert 10 ml test s true positive to false positive ratios improved in the following water quality categories surface water soft and hard water water with heterotrophic bacteria 0 9 cfu ml and 10 99 cfu ml toc in the 1 2 mg l range total chlorine ranges of 0 0 1 mg cl2 l and 0 2 0 5 cl2 l and ph in the 7 1 7 5 and 8 6 ranges this marginal improvement by dilution was an expected result dilution is a technique known to reduce the effect of inhibitors in the water on various analyses apha 2012 heterotrophic bacterial count is a key water quality metric it indicates a sample s microbiological quality and indirectly informs on the disinfectant residual s efficacy samples with a higher bacterial count may cause both false negative and false positive culture results false negatives occur when the heterotrophic bacteria outcompete the slow growing l pneumophila for nutrients toze et al 1990 the resulting low numbers of l pneumophila may not be detected by culture the number of false negatives for all culture methods increased as heterotrophic bacterial counts increased supplemental fig s1 among the three culture methods used in this study no false positives were observed when using bcye culture with maldi ms identification fig 3 this result was due to the accuracy of the maldi ms identification of colonies trnkova et al 2018 notably the bcye maldi ms method had a high false negative rate despite the high accuracy of the maldi identification the false negatives were probably due to the limitations of the bcye culture step these limitations include competition from heterotrophic bacteria colony morphology ambiguity and the 2 ml sample volume that is plated in contrast the legiolert tests had more false positive results data in fig 3 shows that the percent of false positives in the legiolert 10 ml test increased from 0 at 0 9 cfu ml to 100 at 1000 cfu ml of heterotrophic bacteria concurrently the legiolert 100 ml test s false positives increased from 25 to 75 false positives may occur when the sample contains other bacterial species such as pseudomonas spp and stenotrophomonas spp that are known to cross react with the legiolert product hirsh et al 2021 lechevallier 2019 in a study by kyritsi et al 2018 water hardness 300 mg l was positively correlated with higher legionella contamination water hardness measures the amount of minerals specifically calcium and magnesium in a water sample in this study due to small sample size it is unclear if water hardness influenced l pneumophila determination by culture methods however we noted all three culture methods worked well in hard water 60 120 mg l fig 3 additional research and a larger sample size are needed to examine the mechanistic action associated with water hardness and l pneumophila determination due to the likely interplay of water quality parameters it will be interesting to untangle water hardness relevance to l pneumophila contamination an important understanding reinforced by this study s water quality analysis is that water quality variables are interwoven affecting one water quality variable will in turn affect a secondary variable that will involve a tertiary variable and so on in the chain the combined effect will alter increase or decrease l pneumophila concentration affecting the culture detection 4 3 l pneumophila detection by the qpcr method the qpcr testing provided more information regarding l pneumophila occurrence due to its higher sensitivity and resilience to water quality quantitative pcr has a wide detection range from 106 gu cells reaction to as low as one gu cell reaction in a water sample this six log range is useful for environmental monitoring because the number of cells in a water sample is unknown when l pneumophila amounts are high fewer qpcr thermocycles 25 cycles are required to detect the bacteria when there are fewer cells in a sample more thermocycles 35 cycles are required for detection samples with low l pneumophila concentrations have the highest uncertainty and they are the most complex results to interpret for example low l pneumophila concentrations could represent recently dead viable but nonculturable vbnc or amoeba encysted forms if the concentrations are low the results should not be dismissed as dead cells because vbnc and amoeba encysted forms are two postulated l pneumophila survival mechanisms used to evade disinfection fields et al 2002 rowbotham 1980 l pneumophila qpcr detection frequency in built environments has not changed in ten years this study s 22 positive detection frequency table 1 is similar to the 20 detection frequency reported in the donohue et al 2014 cold water study however a water quality related observation that has changed over time is l pneumophila detection frequency in chloramine disinfected water in 2011 the l pneumophila detection frequency in chloramine disinfected water 22 32 148 was similar to chlorine disinfected water 26 55 210 donohue et al 2019 in this study also using qpcr significantly more l pneumophila was detected in chloramine disinfected water other studies using the culture method showed less l pneumophila occurrence in chloramine treated water flannery et al 2006 moore et al 2006 the lower culture occurrence in those studies is likely due to chloramine lowering l pneumophila concentration to levels not detectable by culture methods also chloramine a weaker disinfectant could permit the growth of other water bacteria that out compete l pneumophila s slower growth rate on agar donohue 2021 rhoads et al 2020 this scenario is likely because legionellosis cases and outbreaks occur in areas of chloramination holsinger et al 2022 rhoads et al 2020 in fact the washington dc area with a surface water secondary disinfectant chloramine system has the highest incidence of legionnaires disease of 3 81 per 100 000 persons barskey et al 2022 in the us furthermore in the king et al 2016 source water to distribution entry point study l pneumophila was detected only in one entry point to distribution sample 4 1 24 that positive sample was from a surface water chloramine utility therefore further research is necessary to examine chloramine s effectiveness for legionella spp control 4 4 study limitations in this study the low number of positive culture samples reduced the ability to perform statistical analysis for some comparisons therefore only univariate analysis was performed also the lechevallier 2018 2019 culture distribution studies and donohue et al 2014 2019 qpcr distal end use studies showed that l pneumophila detection pattern is largely sporadic therefore larger sampling sizes and longitudinal studies are planned 5 conclusion water quality influences l pneumophila determination therefore selecting an l pneumophila method is not simple the culture methods are not suitable for all monitoring situations the molecular methods such as qpcr also have limitations thus a method should be chosen with caution knowing that some water quality types will create more false positive or false negative results for chlorinated surface water culture methods perform adequately however for chlorinated groundwater and chloraminated surface or groundwater consider the use of molecular methods despite their limitations in addition to culture the qpcr assays provide definitive results in these water types by reducing the uncertainty in culture testing the purpose of monitoring is another consideration for method selection for example in a legionellosis investigation culture and molecular methods complement each other well performed in concert the molecular assays can help inform what samples have the highest probability of being culture positive also the filtered water for molecular detection can be archived therefore if no culture leads are identified a retrospective examination of the archived water can be performed in situations of buildings with known l pneumophila contamination culture methods are appropriate however if the building s water treatment was changed recently e g on site boosters for chlorination silver copper control or chlorine dioxide generation then culture methods alone may be insufficient this is because the new treatment may suppress legionella growth and hence its detection this outcome was observed in a study published by baron et al 2015 in the baron et al 2015 study during a maintenance related shutdown of the on site monochloramine generator at a hospital legionella levels were observed to increase in the hospital s water supply this trend was observed only because a molecular technique was utilized for general environmental monitoring to evaluate water s microbiological quality it remains unclear whether continual l pneumophila monitoring is cost and time effective if the purpose is to evaluate general microbial control then other indicator tests such as disinfectant residual and hpc testing are better suited also these tests are cost and time effective disinfectant residual testing provides immediate results and hpc testing provides data on the growth of a broad number of bacterial species versus l pneumophila alone therefore in situations where environmental monitoring indicates high levels of heterotrophic bacteria it might be worthwhile to test for l pneumophila using molecular methods which are not affected by the heterotrophic bacteria in conclusion to accurately detect l pneumophila method selection should consider the water quality conditions and the purpose of the testing further research is needed to better understand the water quality influences on l pneumophila

14783,legionellosis is a respiratory disease of public health concern the bacterium legionella pneumophila is the etiologic agent responsible for 90 of legionellosis cases in the united states legionellosis transmission primarily occurs through the inhalation or aspiration of contaminated water aerosols or droplets therefore a thorough understanding of l pneumophila detection methods and their performance in various water quality conditions is needed to develop preventive measures two hundred and nine potable water samples were collected from taps in buildings across the united states l pneumophila was determined using three culture methods buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye culture with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry maldi ms identification legiolert 10 and 100 ml tests and one molecular method quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assay culture and molecular positive results were confirmed by secondary testing including maldi ms eight water quality variables were studied including source water type secondary disinfectant total chlorine residual heterotrophic bacteria total organic carbon toc ph water hardness cold and hot water lines the eight water quality variables were segmented into 28 categories based on scale and ranges and method performance was evaluated in each of these categories additionally a legionella genus qpcr assay was used to determine the water quality variables that promote or hinder legionella spp occurrence l pneumophila detection frequency ranged from 2 to 22 across the methods tested method performance parameters of sensitivity specificity positive and negative predictive values and accuracy were 94 for the qpcr method but ranged from 9 to 100 for the culture methods water quality influenced l pneumophila determination by culture and qpcr methods l pneumophila qpcr detection frequencies positively correlated with toc and heterotrophic bacterial counts the source water disinfectant combination influenced the proportion of legionella spp that is l pneumophila water quality influences l pneumophila determination to accurately detect l pneumophila method selection should consider the water quality in addition to the purpose of testing general environmental monitoring versus disease associated investigations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords legionella pneumophila culture qpcr water quality data availability the data will be available at data gov 1 introduction legionellosis is a respiratory disease of public health concern due to its high death rate legionellosis has two clinical manifestations legionnaire s disease severe and pontiac fever mild the environmental bacterium legionella causes these illnesses there are over 56 recognized species within this genus and eight species l pneumophila l micdadei l bozemanii l gormanii l donaldsonii l feeleii l longbeachae and l parisiensis are considered disease causing although more than one species may cause this disease l pneumophila causes 98 of the united states us legionnaire s disease cases with incidences in all ethnicities sexes and ages however white males 50 years of age have the highest number of reported cases in addition approximately 20 of the reported legionnaire s disease cases are associated with legionella exposure at health care centers senior living facilities or travel settings barskey et al 2020 in the us legionellosis is tracked by the centers for disease control and prevention s cdc national notifiable diseases surveillance system nndss the nndss data shows that the us legionellosis disease rate before 2003 was 0 45 people per 100 000 persons however in the years after 2003 the us legionellosis disease rate increased yearly in 2019 it was 2 1 people per 100 000 persons barskey et al 2022 legionellosis transmission occurs by the inhalation or aspiration of contaminated water or soil aerosols air borne microparticles in the built environment legionella exposure most likely occurs where human activity and water aerosolization intersect in 1976 national awareness of legionellosis increased after a major outbreak at a hotel in philadelphia pennsylvania time 1976 the hotel s air conditioner water supply was contaminated which led to l pneumophila being aerosolized into the hotel s ambient environment this event prompted considerable research on what was then a relatively new disease causing bacterium and initiated a preventive approach to reducing and controlling legionella contamination who 2007 the department of veterans affairs va the cdc and the centers for medicare medicaid services cms have all recommended water management plans and prevention and control approaches to avoid legionellosis outbreaks cdc 2017 cms 2018 va 2014 however these water management plans and prevention and control approaches focus on buildings with high risk for legionella contamination and disease dissemination e g health care or senior living settings additionally the us environmental protection agency us epa has identified l pneumophila as a microbe of emerging public health concern therefore the us epa placed l pneumophila on its contaminant candidate list ccl us epa 2009 the us epa creates the ccl every six years to identify and prioritize water related chemicals and microbes of emerging public health concern thus methods are needed to measure and enumerate l pneumophila in water there are three common environmental culture methods for legionella isolation and enumeration cdc s legionella method standard methods 9260 legionella method and iso method 11731 apha 2012 cdc 2006 iso 2017 these methods offer several sample collection approaches sample processing options obligatory media choices and backend approaches to identify presumptive legionella colonies throughout each culture method process the analyst must make many decisions and assumptions on the collection and processing of the samples in 2017 legiolert a new commercial product entered the market for l pneumophila determination the legiolert test significantly simplifies the front end assumptions and decisions necessary for culture analysis legiolert is a powder containing a substrate and antibiotics that is added to the water sample if l pneumophila is present the water becomes turbid light to dark brown indicating l pneumophila growth however the legiolert test reagent can cross react with other water bacteria such as brevundimonas spp elizabethkingia meningoseptica pseudomonas aeruginosa proteus mirabilis serratia marcescens ochrobactrum spp and stenotrophomonas spp hirsh et al 2021 lechevallier 2019 culture methods including legiolert are susceptible to biological and chemical inhibitors in the water studies by toze et al 1990 and donohue 2021 have shown heterotrophic bacteria can suppress legionella spp and l pneumophila growth high heterotrophic bacterial counts can decrease l pneumophila concentrations this can cause the l pneumophila concentrations to fall below the culture method s limit of detection lod instructions for the legiolert 100 ml test indicate results could be impacted if the water s hardness is either too low or too high thus additional additive is needed to minimize the hardness interference the performance issues with the legionella culture methods resulted in the development and use of molecular methods such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr molecular techniques target highly microbe specific dna or rna sequences to identify and quantify the presence of the microorganism these molecular methods have higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional culture based methods in addition molecular methods are highly tolerant of the sample s water quality however a challenge with molecular methods such as qpcr is they can detect live and dead cells the objective of this research project was to assess three culture methods bcye culture with maldi ms identification donohue 2021 the legiolert 10 ml test the legiolert 100 ml test and one qpcr assay for l pneumophila determination water samples from buildings homes and office buildings were examined by all four methods the performance of each method was assessed against the samples water quality to determine if specific water quality characteristics influenced l pneumophila determination additionally a legionella genus qpcr assay was used to determine the water quality variables that promote or hinder legionella spp occurrence the genus assay helped understand the l pneumophila results in the context of the total amount of legionella within a sample 2 material and methods 2 1 samples in 2017 2019 water samples n 209 from across the us were collected at cold and hot distal taps within homes and office buildings the homes and buildings in this study had no known legionella spp contamination at each tap the water was turned on and after a 15 s flush the water was collected into three 1 l bottles one of the three bottles contained 0 030 mg l sodium thiosulfate to quench chlorine residuals for the culture work the water was collected successively in the three 1 l bottles the bottle with sodium thiosulfate was always collected first this sequence is important because microbial concentrations can fluctuate from one liter to the next during the first 5 min of flow from the tap a limitation of this study design is that the water used for the culture methods was from the bottle with sodium thiosulfate but the water used for the molecular methods and the water quality evaluations were from the bottles without sodium thiosulfate after the water was collected the filled bottles were placed into a cooler with ice packs and shipped overnight to the us epa in cincinnati oh 2 2 sample processing fig 1 a shows the sample processing and analysis flowchart the water in the two one liter bottles without sodium thiosulfate were vacuum filtered for qpcr testing and the remaining one liter bottle with sodium thiosulfate was used for all the culture testings 2 3 water quality eight water quality variables were studied including source water type secondary disinfectant total chlorine residual heterotrophic bacteria total organic carbon ph water hardness cold and hot water lines the water quality variables were always measured using water from the second 1 l bottle the only exception was the hpc test which was done on water from the first 1 l bottle containing sodium thiosulfate the eight water quality variables were segmented into 28 categories based on scale and ranges and method performance was evaluated in each of these categories 2 3 1 ph total chlorine and water hardness a sample s ph total chlorine and hardness were measured immediately upon its arrival at the epa facility a calibrated ph meter was used to measure the ph of the water hanna instruments woonsocket ri total chlorine was measured in a 10 ml volume using the n n diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd method a 5 ml aliquot was used to measure hardness using the hach 5b hardness test kit hach company loveland co all manufacturer s instructions were followed 2 3 2 total organic carbon a 40 ml water aliquot was acidified with 2 m hydrochloric acid a 35 ml volume of the acidified sample was sparged for 12 min for the total organic carbon toc determination a 150 µl sparged sample was injected into a shimadzu toc l instrument shimadzu scientific instruments columbia md a toc value was calculated by averaging the resulting peak area and comparing it to a standard curve generated using the national institute of standards and technology nist potassium hydrogen phthalate khp standard the toc standard curve must be linear and have a r2 of 0 99 for toc determination 2 3 3 heterotrophic plate counts hpc on the day of sample arrival standard methods 9215b was used to enumerate the heterotrophic bacteria the water sample bottle containing sodium thiosulfate was briefly shaken 100 µl aliquots of water were spread plated on bd difco r2a agar plates bd franklin lake nj in duplicate the plates were incubated at 25 c for seven days the colony forming units cfu were counted and recorded on day seven the limit of detection was 10 cfu per ml 2 4 legionella pneumophila methods the culture methods chosen for this study were bcye culture with maldi ms identification donohue 2021 the legiolert 10 ml test and the legiolert 100 ml test the l pneumophila lp16s qpcr assay was selected for its ability to detect and enumerate l pneumophila in diverse water samples source water distribution storage tank and in premise plumbing donohue et al 2014 king et al 2016 the legionella genus qpcr assay targets the ssra gene and has been used by government agencies us cdc and uk health security agency as a reliable method for legionella spp determination benitez and winchell 2013 collins et al 2015 the legionella spp qpcr assay was used to confirm l pneumophila culture positive samples culture negative samples and to be a secondary method to confirm l pneumophila qpcr positive samples 2 4 1 culture methods 2 4 1 1 bcye culture with maldi ms identification on the day the samples arrived a 100 ml aliquot from the bottle containing sodium thiosulfate was vacuum filtered through a 0 2 µm supor 200 membrane pall life sciences port washington ny after filtration the membrane was aseptically transferred using sterile forceps to a 5 ml macrocentrifuge tube celltreat scientific products pepperell ma containing 5 ml sterile water and was vortexed with three 30 s pulses 100 µl suspensions from the resulting concentrate were spread plated on buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye and glycine vancomycin polymyxin cycloheximide gvpc agar plates becton dickinson and company sparks md the plates were incubated inverted at 35 c for 7 days the number of colonies chosen one to three were picked based on morphology gray white color convex and smooth surface iso 2017 for maldi ms analysis the theoretical limit of detection for culture is 0 5 cfu per ml bacterial identification was performed using bruker biotyper maldi ms instrument donohue 2021 2 4 1 2 legiolert after the 1 l sample bottle with sodium thiosulfate was briefly shaken 5 s 10 ml and 100 ml aliquots of water were removed for analysis the manufacturer s instructions were followed for the 10 ml test 10 ml of sample and 90 ml of sterile water were combined for the 100 ml test no additional water was added for each 100 ml sample final volume contents of a legiolert idexx laboratories westbrook me blister pack was added and mixed until granules dissolved following the manufacturer s instructions an additive was added if the water sample hardness was too low or too high next the resulting light yellow liquid was poured into a legiolert quanti tray and sealed the trays were incubated at 39 c for seven days the results were read and recorded on day seven one hundred ml of sterile water was used as the negative control and processed alongside the unknown samples the legiolert assay has a theoretical limit of detection of 0 01 most probable number mpn per ml the liquid from positive wells was used for secondary confirmation testing 2 4 2 qpcr the qpcr procedures for water filtration dna extraction assay conditions and instrument setup and qpcr data interpretations were previously published donohue et al 2014 and a full description was placed in the supplemental file briefly 2 l of water was vacuum filtered through a polycarbonate membrane dna was extracted from the microbes captured on the membrane and the dna was analyzed using qpcr assays for legionella spp and l pneumophila 2 5 methods for confirming presumptive l pneumophila culture positive results the approaches used to confirm presumptive l pneumophila colonies and liquid are shown in fig 1b presumptive colonies from agar plates were identified as l pneumophila by maldi ms to confirm l pneumophila presence in positive legiolert tests the turbid liquid was aseptically removed from the quanti tray and pipetted into a 5 ml macrocentrifuge tube next the presence of l pneumophila was confirmed using maldi ms subculture on bcye and blood agar plates bap and qpcr the procedure used for each method is explained in the supplemental material 2 6 data interpretation a true positive sample was defined as a sample with a positive l pneumophila result by any of the primary methods and confirmed by any secondary methods a true negative sample was defined as a sample that was negative for l pneumophila using all the primary methods a false positive sample was defined as a sample that was positive by only one primary method and the result could not be confirmed by any of the other methods a false negative sample was a sample that was negative by one of the primary methods but was positive by two or more of the other methods sensitivity for each approach was calculated by dividing the number of true positives by the total true positive false negative samples multiplied by 100 specificity for each approach was calculated by dividing the number of true negative samples by the total false positive true negative samples multiplied by 100 positive predictive values ppv were calculated by dividing the number of true positive samples by the total true positive false positive samples multiplied by 100 negative predictive values npv were calculated by dividing the number of true negative samples by the total false negative true negative samples multiplied by 100 accuracy was calculated by adding true positive true negative samples divided by the total true positive false positive false negative true negative samples multiplied by 100 the analysis shown in fig 3 was performed as follows for each water quality variable e g source water the true positive and false positive samples were distributed within the respective categories e g surface water and groundwater next each category s true positives and false positives were added to find the total within that category then the true positive and false positive percentages were calculated for each category 2 7 statistical analysis percentage mean and median were calculated in microsoft excel microsoft corporation redmond wa fisher exact test and chi square analysis were performed in sigmaplot 14 0 systat software inc san jose ca a statistical significance level of 0 05 was used 3 results 3 1 l pneumophila method performance metrics l pneumophila positive detection frequency ranged from 2 22 in this study depending on the method table 1 the legiolert 10 ml procedure had the lowest detection frequency of 2 4 209 and the qpcr lp16s assay had the highest detection frequency of 22 46 209 the qpcr lp16s detection frequency was significantly greater than all the culture detection frequencies x 2 p 0 001 the detection frequencies among the culture methods were not statistically significant table 1 shows the sample volume tested by each method the number of true positive true negative false positive and false negative samples for each method and the method performance metrics sensitivity specificity positive and negative predictive values and accuracy the culture methods specificity values were in the 91 100 range the legiolert 100 ml test had the lower specificity of 91 while the bcye culture with maldi ms identification exhibited a specificity of 100 the sensitivity of culture methods ranged from 9 21 surprisingly the legiolert tests had a low positive predictive value ppv of 40 the ppv for bcye culture with maldi ms identification was 100 this higher ppv was a consequence of using maldi ms for bacterial identification among the culture methods the bcye culture with maldi ms identification had the highest accuracy of 80 in contrast the qpcr lp16s assay s parameters of sensitivity specificity ppv npv and accuracy were 94 3 2 water quality impact on l pneumophila detection fig 2 shows l pneumophila true positives and detection frequencies in eight water quality variables and the respective 28 categories using culture and molecular methods the eight water quality variables evaluated were source water type water hardness total organic carbon toc total chlorine tcl secondary disinfectant ph heterotrophic bacteria cold and hot water lines this analysis helped identify water quality conditions that could promote or hinder the detection of l pneumophila in water using culture methods the highest l pneumophila detection frequencies were in surface water hard water 61 120 mg l water with toc in the 1 2 mg l range water with a tcl concentration in the 0 2 0 5 mg cl2 l range chlorinated water water with ph 8 5 water with heterotrophic bacteria in the 0 9 cfu ml range and cold water lines the l pneumophila qpcr assay detection frequency was similar for surface water and groundwater sources and samples from cold and hot water lines interestingly chloramine disinfected water had significantly higher l pneumophila detection frequency of 43 21 49 than chlorine treated water s 16 25 160 x 2 p 0 001 within the water hardness categories l pneumophila qpcr detection frequency was highest in moderately hard water at 28 19 67 l pneumophila qpcr detection frequencies positively correlated with toc and heterotrophic bacterial counts as toc and heterotrophic bacteria increased so did l pneumophila detection frequency higher l pneumophila detections were observed in water with a ph 8 1 8 5 and ph 8 5 most l pneumophila detections occurred in samples with a total chlorine concentration of 0 5 mg cl2 l and 1 1 mg cl2 l the l pneumophila detection frequencies in total chlorine categories demonstrated a bimodal distribution this bimodal distribution is probably due to secondary disinfectant influences and is being explored further 3 3 confirmatory testing several approaches were employed to confirm whether a colony or well legiolert liquid was positive for l pneumophila fig 1b the bcye culture with maldi ms identification yielded six samples with presumptive l pneumophila colonies those isolates were identified by morphology gray white color convex and smooth surface iso 2017 and confirmed as l pneumophila using maldi ms for bacterial identification thirty five legiolert tests 10 ml and 100 ml had presumptive positive wells where the liquid turned turbid light dark brown maldi ms confirmed l pneumophila in 29 10 35 of the tests in addition to maldi ms analysis the positive liquid was subcultured onto bcye and bap agar plates by bcye subculturing l pneumophila was recovered from the positive liquid in 29 10 35 of samples these samples were the ones also confirmed by maldi ms the 25 remaining legiolert tests that did not yield a confirmatory l pneumophila isolate by subculturing were tested using the qpcr method quantitative pcr confirmed the presence of l pneumophila in four additional tests 16 4 25 l pneumophila recovery by bcye subculturing and maldi ms identification was hindered by the presence of other bacteria pseudomonas spp acinetobacter spp and other unidentified bacteria determined by maldi ms these bacteria grew faster on the media and potentially outcompeted the l pneumophila 3 4 l pneumophila primary methods true positives and false positives by water quality variables the true positive tp to false positive fp ratios were calculated to identify water qualities where l pneumophila tests performed well or underperformed fig 3 fig 3 shows the tp fp ratio for each method in each of the 28 water quality categories the ratios were converted to percentages in order to simplify and visualize the data a good designation was assigned to the combination of water qualities and tests with a tp fp ratio 0 6 60 the unclear designation was assigned to the combination of water qualities and tests with a tp fp ratio between 0 4 0 6 40 60 the combination of water qualities and tests designated as poor had a tp fp ratio of 0 4 40 samples with no data no true positives or false positives were designated as unknown nk among the 28 water quality categories examined the bcye culture with maldi ms identification had fifteen water quality categories where the tp fp ratio was good 60 bcye culture with maldi ms identification produced no false positives 0 28 species identification by maldi ms allowed for this performance legiolert 10 ml and 100 ml tests performed well with a good tp fp ratio 60 in five and three water quality categories respectively the legiolert 10 ml test performed well in surface water hard water water with 0 9 cfu ml of heterotrophic bacteria and at two ph ranges 7 1 7 5 and 8 6 the legiolert 100 ml test performed well in surface water hard water water with 0 9 cfu ml of heterotrophic bacteria however the 100 ml test tp fp ratios declined compared to the 10 ml test these results suggest the legiolert 10 ml test where the 10 ml sample is diluted with 90 ml sterile water helped enhance the method s performance by diluting potential inhibitors in the sample that obstruct legiolert s color reaction also the legiolert 10 ml and 100 ml tests had 12 and 15 water quality categories respectively where the tp fp ratio was 40 which put them in the poor designation the 28 water quality categories tested did not influence qpcr detection of l pneumophila as indicated by the true positive to false positive ratios fig 3 3 5 water quality categories that support legionella spp detection the legionella genus qpcr assay revealed the water quality conditions that support legionella spp detection fig 4 shows legionella spp detection in the 28 water quality categories legionella spp detection frequencies within source water types and water line types were similar within the water hardness categories moderately hard water 61 120 mg l had the highest detection frequency for legionella spp 61 41 67 interestingly chloramine treated water had a significantly higher legionella spp detection frequency of 73 36 46 compared to chlorine treated water at 41 66 160 x 2 p 0 001 higher legionella spp detection frequencies trended with higher heterotrophic bacterial counts and toc samples with a total chlorine concentration of 0 to 0 1 mg cl2 l and 1 1 mg cl2 l had the highest positive detection frequencies for legionella spp within the chlorine ranges detection of legionella spp was influenced by the ph two ph ranges 7 1 7 5 and 8 1 8 5 were observed to have the highest legionella spp detection total chlorine and ph s bimodal distributions suggest the secondary disinfectant choice may influence legionella spp detection frequency chloraminated water retained a higher total chlorine residual avg 1 6 mg cl2 l and higher ph avg 8 2 than the chlorinated water with total chlorine residual avg 0 5 mg cl2 l and ph avg 7 8 3 6 relationship between legionella spp and l pneumophila fig 5 shows the relationship between legionella spp and l pneumophila in source water disinfectant categories the categories were surface water chlorine n 98 surface water chloramine n 39 groundwater chloramine n 10 and groundwater chlorine n 62 legionella spp was detected in 102 samples in this study legionella spp highest detection rate of 80 8 10 was in groundwater chloramine samples followed by surface water chloramine at 72 28 39 surface water chlorine at 43 42 98 and groundwater chlorine at 39 24 62 additionally fig 5 shows which samples were l pneumophila positive by method type among four source water disinfectant categories an estimated l pneumophila percentage of the total legionella spp was calculated using the two qpcr results l p in figure 5 values are in parenthesis fig 5 shows that not every legionella spp positive sample was also positive for l pneumophila in fact by qpcr l pneumophila was only detected in 45 46 102 of the positive legionella spp samples this figure also shows how water quality may affect the l pneumophila percentage within the total legionella spp population in surface water chlorine by qpcr it was estimated that l pneumophila represented on average 48 average of the l p of the total legionella spp population in surface water chlorine the culture methods detected l pneumophila when l pneumophila represented 45 100 of the total legionella spp population for the water quality types of groundwater chlorine surface water chloramine and groundwater chloramine by qpcr l pneumophila represented on average 32 15 and 7 average l p of the total legionella spp population respectively in these other water quality types culture methods did not detect l pneumophila except 1 sample these results suggest the sample s source water disinfectant combination influences the proportion of legionella spp that is l pneumophila in chloramine treated water surface or ground water more samples were positive for legionella spp compared to chlorine treated water however in chloramine treated water the proportion of l pneumophila within the legionella spp population was low compared to chlorine treated water this data suggests more research is needed to understand the risk and tradeoffs associated with disinfectant choices this analysis also suggests culture methods need higher concentrations of l pneumophila among the total legionella spp population to perform well in these source water disinfectant categories 4 discussion the us drinking water supply is not uniform in its water quality many areas of the us encounter source and potable water quality challenges such as drought related changes in hardness ph and toc brackish and nutrient rich water arsenic and manganese contamination dieter et al 2018 these water quality challenges can substantially increase the treatment effort needed to provide clean and safe drinking water to communities therefore drinking water methods must be sensitive specific and robust in a wide range of water quality types a method is a systematic approach by which a component is qualitatively or quantitatively measured the performance of a method is measured by several factors such as sensitivity specificity the limit of detection the limit of quantification dynamic range and robustness this study examined three culture methods and one qpcr method for detecting l pneumophila in potable water collected from homes and office buildings with no known legionella contamination 4 1 l pneumophila culture methods this study s l pneumophila culture detection frequency of 2 5 table 1 in homes and buildings is comparable to the 5 8 in premise plumbing and hospital samples reported by mccuin et al 2021 and 2 11 in distribution water samples reported by lechevallier 2018 2019 this study s l pneumophila culture detection frequency is similar to the 6 14 218 detection frequency in homes that stout et al 1992 reported over 30 years ago it is interesting to note that the l pneumophila culture detection frequency in homes has not changed substantially in 30 years although legionellosis cases have increased 9 fold over the same time period barskey et al 2022 this observation suggests several possible scenarios first for example culture methods are not sensitive enough to accurately detect l pneumophila occurrence in all drinking water qualities second if l pneumophila occurrence has remained the same then increased exposure to aerosols or new exposure routes have developed third l pneumophila strains have become more virulent causing higher infection rates david et al 2016 wee et al 2021 however other studies have reported higher l pneumophila culture detection frequencies including 14 by petrisek and hall 2018 30 by scaturro et al 2020 51 57 by spies et al 2018 and 85 by boczek et al 2021 a close examination of the sample types in these studies indicates a higher likelihood of l pneumophila contamination for example some of these studies focused on a l pneumophila contaminated pilot scale in premise plumbing system or hot water heaters therefore it is vital to understand the sample type l pneumophila contaminated or not and the purpose of the sampling general environmental monitoring treatment challenge testing or determination of the source of a legionellosis case because these variables and choices can inflate or deflate our understanding of l pneumophila s environmental occurrence in this study the bcye culture with maldi ms identification had a false positive rate of 0 this low false positive rate was due to the accuracy of maldi ms identification trnkova et al 2018 the legiolert 10 ml and 100 ml culture tests had a 3 6 209 and 7 15 209 false positive rate respectively if only surface water samples were considered then the false positive rate for the legiolert 10 and 100 ml tests drop to 1 1 135 and 4 5 135 respectively these rates are comparable to the 0 5 5 rates reported in previous surface water studies lechevallier 2018 sartory et al 2017 on the other hand if only groundwater samples were considered in this study then the false positive rate for the legiolert 10 ml and 100 ml tests increases to 7 5 74 and 14 10 74 respectively there are many possible explanations for the legiolert s higher false positive rate in groundwater samples the proprietary legiolert test relies on l pneumophila expressing an enzyme that reacts with a substrate to initiate a color reaction it is possible the groundwater environment and its chemical properties are enhancing the substrate color reaction or promoting the expression of the enzyme in other bacterial species resulting in false positives it is possible this study s samples had a higher occurrence of waterborne bacterial fauna such as brevundimonas spp elizabethkingia meningoseptica pseudomonas aeruginosa proteus mirabilis serratia marcescens ochrobactrum spp and stenotrophomonas spp which are known to cross react with the legiolert test hirsh et al 2021 lechevallier 2019 in fact during bcye and bap confirmation testing of legiolert positive samples pseudomonas spp and stenotrophomonas spp were routinely identified from the legiolert positive liquid using maldi ms recently during a legionellosis outbreak investigation the legiolert 100 ml test was used to identify the source of l pneumophila unfortunately all the legiolert 100 ml positive tests were false positives the color reaction was not due to l pneumophila but due to pseudomonas spp and proteus spp fugitt 2018 another potential explanation is that this study s sample set contained more water quality diversity including more groundwater samples than samples used in other published studies for example of the articles that reported water type lechevallier s 2018 2019 samples were mainly surface water and boczek et al 2021 samples were from a pilot scale in premise plumbing system that received chlorinated surface water in a controlled environment 4 2 the impact of water quality on l pneumophila culture determination understanding the impact of water quality on l pneumophila determination is a unique aspect of this study fig 3 shows the true positive to false positive ratios for the l pneumophila methods under all the water quality categories studied water quality did not affect the bcye culture with maldi ms identification based on the true positive to false positive ratios the bcye culture with maldi ms identification is a procedure where the bacteria are removed from the water matrix and therefore the sample s water chemistry has a minimal impact also picking single colonies from the agar plates and identifying them using an accurate maldi ms technique that is largely immune to water quality influences makes this approach more robust and applicable to a wide range of water qualities water quality affected the legiolert tests the dilution of a sample s water quality in the legiolert 10 ml test relatively improved the test s true positive to false positive ratio compared to the 100 ml test where the sample was not diluted for some water qualities fig 3 the legiolert 10 ml test s true positive to false positive ratios improved in the following water quality categories surface water soft and hard water water with heterotrophic bacteria 0 9 cfu ml and 10 99 cfu ml toc in the 1 2 mg l range total chlorine ranges of 0 0 1 mg cl2 l and 0 2 0 5 cl2 l and ph in the 7 1 7 5 and 8 6 ranges this marginal improvement by dilution was an expected result dilution is a technique known to reduce the effect of inhibitors in the water on various analyses apha 2012 heterotrophic bacterial count is a key water quality metric it indicates a sample s microbiological quality and indirectly informs on the disinfectant residual s efficacy samples with a higher bacterial count may cause both false negative and false positive culture results false negatives occur when the heterotrophic bacteria outcompete the slow growing l pneumophila for nutrients toze et al 1990 the resulting low numbers of l pneumophila may not be detected by culture the number of false negatives for all culture methods increased as heterotrophic bacterial counts increased supplemental fig s1 among the three culture methods used in this study no false positives were observed when using bcye culture with maldi ms identification fig 3 this result was due to the accuracy of the maldi ms identification of colonies trnkova et al 2018 notably the bcye maldi ms method had a high false negative rate despite the high accuracy of the maldi identification the false negatives were probably due to the limitations of the bcye culture step these limitations include competition from heterotrophic bacteria colony morphology ambiguity and the 2 ml sample volume that is plated in contrast the legiolert tests had more false positive results data in fig 3 shows that the percent of false positives in the legiolert 10 ml test increased from 0 at 0 9 cfu ml to 100 at 1000 cfu ml of heterotrophic bacteria concurrently the legiolert 100 ml test s false positives increased from 25 to 75 false positives may occur when the sample contains other bacterial species such as pseudomonas spp and stenotrophomonas spp that are known to cross react with the legiolert product hirsh et al 2021 lechevallier 2019 in a study by kyritsi et al 2018 water hardness 300 mg l was positively correlated with higher legionella contamination water hardness measures the amount of minerals specifically calcium and magnesium in a water sample in this study due to small sample size it is unclear if water hardness influenced l pneumophila determination by culture methods however we noted all three culture methods worked well in hard water 60 120 mg l fig 3 additional research and a larger sample size are needed to examine the mechanistic action associated with water hardness and l pneumophila determination due to the likely interplay of water quality parameters it will be interesting to untangle water hardness relevance to l pneumophila contamination an important understanding reinforced by this study s water quality analysis is that water quality variables are interwoven affecting one water quality variable will in turn affect a secondary variable that will involve a tertiary variable and so on in the chain the combined effect will alter increase or decrease l pneumophila concentration affecting the culture detection 4 3 l pneumophila detection by the qpcr method the qpcr testing provided more information regarding l pneumophila occurrence due to its higher sensitivity and resilience to water quality quantitative pcr has a wide detection range from 106 gu cells reaction to as low as one gu cell reaction in a water sample this six log range is useful for environmental monitoring because the number of cells in a water sample is unknown when l pneumophila amounts are high fewer qpcr thermocycles 25 cycles are required to detect the bacteria when there are fewer cells in a sample more thermocycles 35 cycles are required for detection samples with low l pneumophila concentrations have the highest uncertainty and they are the most complex results to interpret for example low l pneumophila concentrations could represent recently dead viable but nonculturable vbnc or amoeba encysted forms if the concentrations are low the results should not be dismissed as dead cells because vbnc and amoeba encysted forms are two postulated l pneumophila survival mechanisms used to evade disinfection fields et al 2002 rowbotham 1980 l pneumophila qpcr detection frequency in built environments has not changed in ten years this study s 22 positive detection frequency table 1 is similar to the 20 detection frequency reported in the donohue et al 2014 cold water study however a water quality related observation that has changed over time is l pneumophila detection frequency in chloramine disinfected water in 2011 the l pneumophila detection frequency in chloramine disinfected water 22 32 148 was similar to chlorine disinfected water 26 55 210 donohue et al 2019 in this study also using qpcr significantly more l pneumophila was detected in chloramine disinfected water other studies using the culture method showed less l pneumophila occurrence in chloramine treated water flannery et al 2006 moore et al 2006 the lower culture occurrence in those studies is likely due to chloramine lowering l pneumophila concentration to levels not detectable by culture methods also chloramine a weaker disinfectant could permit the growth of other water bacteria that out compete l pneumophila s slower growth rate on agar donohue 2021 rhoads et al 2020 this scenario is likely because legionellosis cases and outbreaks occur in areas of chloramination holsinger et al 2022 rhoads et al 2020 in fact the washington dc area with a surface water secondary disinfectant chloramine system has the highest incidence of legionnaires disease of 3 81 per 100 000 persons barskey et al 2022 in the us furthermore in the king et al 2016 source water to distribution entry point study l pneumophila was detected only in one entry point to distribution sample 4 1 24 that positive sample was from a surface water chloramine utility therefore further research is necessary to examine chloramine s effectiveness for legionella spp control 4 4 study limitations in this study the low number of positive culture samples reduced the ability to perform statistical analysis for some comparisons therefore only univariate analysis was performed also the lechevallier 2018 2019 culture distribution studies and donohue et al 2014 2019 qpcr distal end use studies showed that l pneumophila detection pattern is largely sporadic therefore larger sampling sizes and longitudinal studies are planned 5 conclusion water quality influences l pneumophila determination therefore selecting an l pneumophila method is not simple the culture methods are not suitable for all monitoring situations the molecular methods such as qpcr also have limitations thus a method should be chosen with caution knowing that some water quality types will create more false positive or false negative results for chlorinated surface water culture methods perform adequately however for chlorinated groundwater and chloraminated surface or groundwater consider the use of molecular methods despite their limitations in addition to culture the qpcr assays provide definitive results in these water types by reducing the uncertainty in culture testing the purpose of monitoring is another consideration for method selection for example in a legionellosis investigation culture and molecular methods complement each other well performed in concert the molecular assays can help inform what samples have the highest probability of being culture positive also the filtered water for molecular detection can be archived therefore if no culture leads are identified a retrospective examination of the archived water can be performed in situations of buildings with known l pneumophila contamination culture methods are appropriate however if the building s water treatment was changed recently e g on site boosters for chlorination silver copper control or chlorine dioxide generation then culture methods alone may be insufficient this is because the new treatment may suppress legionella growth and hence its detection this outcome was observed in a study published by baron et al 2015 in the baron et al 2015 study during a maintenance related shutdown of the on site monochloramine generator at a hospital legionella levels were observed to increase in the hospital s water supply this trend was observed only because a molecular technique was utilized for general environmental monitoring to evaluate water s microbiological quality it remains unclear whether continual l pneumophila monitoring is cost and time effective if the purpose is to evaluate general microbial control then other indicator tests such as disinfectant residual and hpc testing are better suited also these tests are cost and time effective disinfectant residual testing provides immediate results and hpc testing provides data on the growth of a broad number of bacterial species versus l pneumophila alone therefore in situations where environmental monitoring indicates high levels of heterotrophic bacteria it might be worthwhile to test for l pneumophila using molecular methods which are not affected by the heterotrophic bacteria in conclusion to accurately detect l pneumophila method selection should consider the water quality conditions and the purpose of the testing further research is needed to better understand the water quality influences on l pneumophila

14784,small water bodies such as interval water flooded ditches ponds and streams serve as important nutrient sinks in many landscapes especially in the multi water continuum system yet watershed nutrient cycling models often fail to or insufficiently capture these waters resulting in great uncertainty in quantifying the distributed transfer and retention of nutrients across diverse landscapes in a watershed in this study we present a network based predictive framework of the nutrient transport process in nested small water bodies which incorporates topology structure hydrological and biogeochemical processes and connectivity to perform a nonlinear and distributed scaling of nutrient transfer and retention the framework was validated and applied to n transport in a multi water continuum watershed in the yangtze river basin we show that the importance of n loading and retention depends on the spatial context of grid source and water bodies because of the great variation in location connectivity and water types our results demonstrate that hotspots in nutrient loading and retention could be accurately and efficiently identified through hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions this offers an effective approach for the reduction of watershed scale nutrient loads this framework can be used in modeling to identify where and how to restore small water bodies for reduced non point pollution from agricultural watersheds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords small water bodies topology structure nutrient loading and retention model framework multi water continuum system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction small water bodies such as ditches ponds streams dominate the distribution of global freshwater and play a crucial role in nutrient removal during nutrient transport along the aquatic continuum from landscape to ocean cheng and basu 2017 according to a model analysis based on a high resolution dataset in the northeastern united states small ponds are collectively responsible for 34 69 and 12 of the mean annual retention of nitrogen phosphorus and sediment respectively schmadel et al 2019 taking the pond stream reservoir continuum as an example up to 83 4 of total aquatic n was estimated to be removed during small waterways transport in a rice dominated watershed in eastern china li et al 2013 the hotspots of nutrient removal in small water bodies have been broadly reported and concluded to be the inverse relationship between removal rate constants and water size because of the decreasing contact area to volume ratios with the increase in stream size alexander et al 2000 cheng and basu 2017 despite the importance of small water bodies to nutrient retention there is great variability in the capacity of individual water body to remove nutrients for example five watersheds in the mississippi river basin with similar crop covers and non ephemeral water bodies showed distinct nitrate removal fractions with a wetland that intercepts 100 of the drainage area being three times more effective than one that intercepts 50 of the drainage area hansen et al 2018 the variation in nutrient retention is related to the time nutrient spends in contact with benthic surfaces with removal efficiency generally scaling with water size location and depth alexander et al 2000 boyer et al 2006 schmadel et al 2019 based on a clear conceptual model xia and yan 2020 quantified the importance of water size and spatial location to nutrient retention the spatial patterning of water bodies particularly their spatial location plays a crucial role in determining the nutrient removal potential for a suite of water bodies within a watershed weller et al 1998 xia and yan 2020 therefore understanding the structure of water networks is essential to improve nutrient retention modeling at a watershed scale since they play important roles in the physical chemical and biological processes of nutrients cheng et al 2020 although water network structure is known to be crucial for nutrient retention research on watershed nutrient cycling is limited by insufficient representation of spatial patterns of water bodies in modeling recent studies have attempted to quantify the effects of a hierarchical network of nested water bodies using various approaches including dynamic connectivity czuba et al 2018 hansen et al 2018 network topology heasley et al 2019 individual location hansen et al 2018 and geography metrics xia and yan 2020 however these approaches have limitations such as the explicit mapping wetland connectivity to the river network which does not easily allow consideration of geographically isolated wetlands czuba et al 2018 hansen et al 2018 furthermore some studies have estimated nutrient retention in isolated water bodies by simply aggregating the nutrient retention of all isolated small water bodies within the watershed without considering location effects of small water bodies cheng et al 2020 our recent study attempted to estimate nutrient retention in small water bodies through direct consideration of geography metrics such as mean size distance to the stream and evenness of location xia and yan 2020 however this conceptual approach is limited by the lack of detailed topological structure between landscapes that captures hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions the insufficient representation of spatial patterns of small water bodies may result in great uncertainty in quantifying the distributed transfer and retention of nutrients across diverse landscapes in a small multi water bodies continuum watershed the focus of this paper is on the detailed topology structure of diverse landscapes including small water bodies for a new application in modeling the distributed transfer and retention of nutrients along the aquatic continuum in a multi water watershed a new framework is presented that accounts for the hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions between the individual small water bodies and upland sources the framework is then applied to the multi water jurong watershed and its validity is tested at both catchment and watershed scales by using this framework we demonstrate how the interactive effects of small water bodies influence the distributed transfer and retention of nutrients the ultimate goal is to develop a new framework that can be used to assess where and how to restore small water bodies for optimal water quality benefits in multi water bodies continuum watersheds 2 new framework development and parameterization 2 1 development of the new framework the proposed framework shown in fig 1 integrates the concept of topology structure and hydrological connectivity that quantifies nutrient retention and transfer through an interacting upland water body connected network we assume that released nutrients flow downhill from the cropland through overland runoff or ditches and ponds and probably again through ditches and ponds and then enter a stream network finally reaching a reservoir or lake in a nested small water bodies continuum a watershed could be divided into w sub watersheds according to w water bodies fig 1 we use a subscript w for each source s w i to identify the sequence of the water body and its associated subwatershed according to its position and pathway the subscript w is designed to reflect the routing of a source and forms the basis of important hydrographical indicators of its topological structure hydrological connectivity is a broad term that has been used in various contexts owing in part to the varying influence that hydrologic connectivity has on a wide variety of watershed processes of physical and biological importance here we referred to the definition from wohl et al 2019 that the connectivity is the efficiency of the transfer of nutrients between water bodies the connectivity includes structural and dynamic functional components where the spatial patterns are the structural connectivity and the dynamic connectivity relates to the changes in these spatial patterns with time singh and sinha 2019 wainwright et al 2011 based on the spatio temporal characteristics of nutrient transfer and retention we distinguish two kinds of waterways isolated areal water bodies aw and interconnected linear water bodies lw isolated areal water bodies located away from rivers such as ponds reservoirs and wetlands are connected episodically or only via the subsurface cohen et al 2016 the final quantity of the nutrient load depends on the residence time and retention efficiency of lw and aw through which the nutrients pass residence time in aw depends mainly on water area and depth interconnected linear water bodies are ditches streams and river networks sometimes connected with reservoirs and lakes where residence time depends mainly on the length and the slope nutrient retention efficiency for aw is significantly different from that of lw because of their small size with high perimeter length per unit area low flow velocity and the first landscape flush of solutes cohen et al 2016 semlitsch and bodie 1998 the value of differentiating these two water bodies is to better represent nutrient retention by simple geometric and geographic parameters we defined and distinguished two kinds of connectivity indexes to represent transfer and retention 1 loading of nonpoint sources to waters s t o w w i this index is used to calculate the loading of the ith source of the wth subwatershed to each water along the pathway which takes into account both the source strength and removal fraction along the waterway the removal fraction is related to the location and removal efficiency of the water body through which the nutrients pass which increases with respect to increasing water area or flow path length because of the long residence time for nutrients each of the released nutrient masses from uplands s w i will be retained successively by lw r l and aw r a along the flow path an additional quantity of the source will be removed if there are more than one lw and more aw in the pathway of the source 1 sto w w i s w i r l 1 r a 1 r l 2 r a 2 r ln r am s w i j 1 n r lj k 1 m r ak where r l and r a are released fractions of the nutrients received by lw and aw respectively we calculate the released factor of nutrients during water transport r l r a by letting each unit of travel time t have a dynamic removal rate k of the nutrient it receives cheng and basu 2017 the calculation of k includes the importance of water size location and water type as described in the next section xia and yan 2020 for evaluating the travel time t l of the nutrient from a given grid i the travel times into all similar waters that are localized along the path between the ith unit and the terminal water reached can be summed 2 r exp k t for lw the travel time is assumed to increase as the length l i of the hydraulic path increases and as the square root of the average slope of the hydraulic path decreases ferro and porto 2000 this gives 3 t l l v l i l c r i l 2 3 s i l 1 n j 1 n l i j r i j 2 3 s i j in which n is the number of linear water bodies localized along the hydraulic path i l i j r i j and s i j are the length hydraulic radius and average slope of each source i localized to water j along the hydraulic path respectively according to chezy s uniform open channel flow equation cardoso et al 1989 c is chezy s constant which is related to manning s roughness coefficient n between 0 02 and 0 05 r is hydraulic radius or hydraulic depth calculated by dividing the water flow s cross sectional area by the wetted perimeter of lw to avoid infinite in the equation we opted 0 005 for the minimum slope value for aw the travel time depends on the total area of the water a a through which the nutrients pass cheng and basu 2017 as the upland source would travel a chain of areal waters in the watershed the total travel time t a in aw depends on the cumulative area of waters passed through by the nutrients 4 t a β 1 a a β 2 β 1 j 1 m a aj β 2 where β 1 1 50 β 2 0 23 are the coefficients derived from a meta analysis of different small water bodies across the world cheng and basu 2017 a aj is the water area of the m water body passed combining the above equations we can integrate s t o w w i with general properties of the landscape based on gis data and the biogeochemical reaction processes in water bodies 5 sto w w i s w i

which is defined as the internal linkages between the loading from nutrient sources in the upper parts of the water body and the discharging to the water body downstream w t o s w takes into account the strength of nutrient loading and removal by the water body which includes the retention efficiency water position and water size xia and yan 2020 water size determines the travel time in the water body for all nutrient sources in the drainage area water location determines the strength of sources loaded and the structure between sources and water bodies if there are other water bodies between the sources and the water body removal by these water bodies has to be included again the removal is calculated by nutrient sources in the upper parts of catchments and the corresponding sink characteristics for the downstream water bodies that source flow from one to the next w t o s w also decreases with the increase of water size above as the bigger water volume above has more residence time and removal potential 6 w t o s w i 1 n s w i 1 r w f o r w 1 7 w t o s w r w 1 1 r w 1 c w s w 1 j 1 m s w j 1 r w f o r w 1 where 1 r w is the fraction of the nutrients removed by the wth water body the water body could be a linear water body r l or an areal water body r a as calculated above if the water body is the first order or the outermost of the watershed all sources loading s w i into the subwatershed will be equally removed if the water body is not in the outermost of the subwatershed the discharge from the water body upstream r w 1 1 r w 1 c w s w 1 and other sources s w j in the subwatershed will be equally removed and so on the index calculation above is grid based which includes both geographic parameters and biogeochemical reaction parameters the geographic parameters of s i j l i j a aj could be simply obtained or calculated using standard gis software such as arcgis hydraulic radius r is calculated based on the catchment area to lw width for simplicity and cost efficient calculation we let water flow at a depth equal to the hydraulic radius according to the lw channel dimensions https www omnicalculator com however it is difficult to identify j 1 m a aj and j 1 m l i j s i j and k a k l for aw and lw below we describe a detailed procedure to quantify these geographic parameters and biological removal factors 2 2 geographic parameters identification in calculating the loading of nutrient sources to water bodies s t o w w i the deterministic eight node d8 method is used to identify the cumulative area of aws and cumulative length of lws along the flow direction for each cell to integrate similar water bodies for simple implementation and computational efficiency the calculation procedures for aws and lws are a little different because of their differences in a nested structure for aws the cumulative area of aws and cumulative length of episodically lws between aws are calculated separately fig 2 we use the recursive traversal and design the following steps to calculate j 1 m a aj and j 1 m l i j s i j for each grid cell source 1 setting the watershed boundary for calculation homogeneous lws and aws are united respectively by setting a distinguishing raster value for example rivers are greatly diverse in retention efficiency but rivers with the same strahler order are generally similar in retention efficiency for unit river length in the same watershed and correspondingly could be coded with the same value and gathered together for further analysis 2 each grid cell in lw is initially assigned one accumulated lw length unit and the first cell is then selected for processing 3 the slope of the selected cell except for the ones located on the edge of the watershed is computed for its eight neighbor nodes based on a digital elevation model dem once the greater positive slope is identified the cell receives a specific coding that identifies the downstream cell 4 if the downstream cell intercepts with aw the area of the water body will be recorded and added to the grid or else the length and slope of the cell will be recorded and added to the grid the downstream cell or water body is marked as checked 5 the next cell of the grid is selected if there are any unchecked cells or water bodies downstream and step 2 is repeated step 3 is continued until the preceding cell intercepts with the terminal water body cells 6 the algorithm continues until all the cells in the watershed are processed and the accumulated flow length and area for each grid allow the calculation of the lw release r l and aw release r a from their respective predefined release fractions for lws the cumulative lengths for different orders are calculated respectively fig 3 the calculation procedure is similar to that for aw above but in step 4 when the downstream cells intercept with another order lw the travel length of the water will be recorded and added for the grid in calculating the retention of a water body to nonpoint sources w t o s w the calculations for lw and aw are a little different in their topological structure for lws such as river networks the topological structure between river sections is typically known so we need only to build the topological structure between the lws and upland sources fig 4 however for aws the topological structure between them is often unknown which means that both the topological structure between aws and the topological structure between aws and upland sources must be developed fig 5 we developed the following algorithm in arcgis without i o operations to calculate w t o s w for the lw and aw 1 for each linear or areal water body the watershed tool is used to identify the catchment of the water body and the water body is then marked as checked 2 the catchment raster identified above converts to a polygon and intersection analysis is used to record the contributing grid sources and water bodies 3 the next water body is selected and steps 1 and 2 are repeated until a headwater or the outermost water body is found after all water bodies are processed we identify the contributing grid sources and water bodies for each water body 4 if there is more than one water body in the catchment we sort them into a descending order according to their location by comparing their dem values 5 the release and removal of each water body are calculated in order based on the predefined release fractions 6 the algorithm continues until all the water bodies in the watershed are processed and the release and removal of each water body have been integrated 2 3 biological removal parameters biological removal includes temporary removal for example plant uptake burial and permanent removal for example denitrification anammox processes which depend on a variety of factors including nutrient loading water body types respiration rates and contact time of the water with sediments alexander et al 2000 boyer et al 2006 despite such complexity and the heterogeneity of processes across a variety of aw and lw studies simple and available geomorphic parameters have been broadly used to represent the dynamic removal rate k t reflecting the aggregate net effects of physical hydrological and biochemical properties alexander et al 2000 cheng et al 2020 ensign and doyle 2006 for aws the meta analysis showed a remarkably consistent and significant relationship between the first order nutrient removal rate k a and the water retention time t a which was validated by a sediment water model that links major nutrient removal processes with water size cheng and basu 2017 8 k a c a t a d a where c a and d a for different nutrients tn no3 nh4 tp could be derived from cheng and basu 2017 by a meta analysis of 178 wetlands across the world for lws using water depth as an explanatory variable produced the best first order decay rate k l predictions with long term streamflow and water quality data gathered from measured streams in the northeastern united states alexander et al 2000 2007 9 k l c l d d l where d mean water depth m c l 0 051 and d l 1 319 water depth is expressed as a simple function of mean annual stream flow q m3 s if the measurement of water depth is not available for some river sections which is based on flow data from 374 monitoring stations in the usa alexander et al 2000 10 d 0 2396 q 0 4363 where stream discharge q is again estimated using a popular curve number method scs cn method that includes soil and land use vegetative cover characteristics of the watershed satheeshkumar et al 2017 the curve number method was developed in the 1960s by the usda soil conservation service scs now the natural resources conservation service and has since become established as a popular ubiquitous and enduring means of estimating storm runoff from rainfall events thus the dynamic first order nutrient removal rate can be simply estimated using the spatial surface area of the aw and stream flow data of lw applied to each reach below we illustrate our approach by estimating the distributed nitrogen transfer and retention in a watershed with combined lws and aws 3 application of the new framework 3 1 watershed and data we chose the jurong reservoir watershed in the lower reaches of yangtze river basin as a case study because of the existing small multi water bodies with high resolution 10 m resolution lisar data fig 6 which are described in detail by yan et al 2011 briefly the watershed located 40 km southeast of nanjing in china s jiangsu province 32 01 n 119 13 e fig 6 is 45 5 km2 and a typical agricultural watershed with rice paddies and cultivated upland accounting for 32 2 and 22 8 of the total area respectively there are one reservoir three main streams and thousands of small ponds that occupy 8 2 of the watershed area the three streams join the reservoir at the lowest part of the watershed the mean annual air temperature and precipitation are 15 c and 1050 mm respectively there is no industry or intensive livestock farming in the watershed and no human or livestock waste is directly discharged into waterways yan et al 2011 we validated our n loading and removal estimation through waterways at two scales one is a catchment scale with measurements of five pond sites and six stream sites and the other is a watershed scale with annual estimated n removal by the pond stream and reservoir with regression models as shown in fig 6 the selected five ponds belong to one subwatershed with each pond having a different catchment area and topological relationship to the water bodies the catchments of the first and the fourth ponds have no other ponds inside while the catchments of the second third and fifth have other ponds inside in addition the catchments of the third and fifth ponds contain the catchments of the second and the fourth ponds respectively the selected six river sites are located in the three main streams with three of these sites in the central two in the western streams and one in the eastern stream xia and yan 2020 as the purpose of this study was to model the transfer and retention of nutrients in waterways transport nutrient export from the upland was estimated based on an improved export coefficient model and budget study in a simple way yan et al 2011 wang et al 2014 here we took total dissolved nitrogen tdn as a case nutrient because it is probably more accessible to removal in transport the applied export coefficient model describes the dynamic process of tdn export from the field as the function of n budget and hydrology for different land uses which was fully validated in the yangtze river basin during 1970 2003 wang et al 2014 nitrogen budget was conducted both at the subwatershed and watershed scales based on intensive monitoring of stream and pond n dynamics measurements atmospheric deposition ammonia nh3 volatilization and household interviews about n related agricultural activities yan et al 2011 besides nutrient export from the upland we also included atmospheric dry and wet deposition to water bodies based on our previous measurements yan et al 2011 nitrogen removal in water bodies is scaled to the catchment and watershed based on sediment denitrification measurements li et al 2013 there are three processes related to n removal in water bodies including denitrification biological absorption and sedimentation as there are few plants and fishes in these water bodies absorption by biology was not included in the long run sedimentation is almost balanced with the release of sediment denitrification is one of the most important parts of n reduction in water bodies because it can remove n permanently from the aquatic cycle seitzinger et al 2006 our previous studies have shown that n removal via denitrification could account for as much as 83 4 of total retained tdn li et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 briefly net sediment denitrification rates of these sites five pond sites and six stream sites were directly measured and the key factors that control net sediment denitrification were determined every 2 months between november 2010 and december 2011 net sediment n2 fluxes net sediment denitrification rates were determined by membrane inlet mass spectrometry and the n2 ar technique kana et al 1994 linear regression and linear mixed effect model analysis showed that no3 concentration and temperature in surface water were the primary controlling factors for net sediment denitrification which accounted for 86 variation in denitrification rates using monitoring data on no3 concentrations and temperature of the surface water of waterways and an established linear mixed effect model tdn removed from the ponds and stream was estimated li et al 2013 we further used the framework model the spatial patterns of n loading and removal along the multi water continuum system based on geographic parameters identification the successive n transfer and removal for each grid source through each water body to the outlet was calculated by tracking the length in lws or area in aws and its removal rate in the jurong reservoir watershed the flow path of water bodies from any cell source to the watershed outlet is divided into seven segments the first segment is from cell source to stream while not in a pond noted as overland flow or ditch sink the second segment is the pond sink from the cell source to the stream in which all the passed ponds are included to include the great difference in n removal between stream orders we further differentiated four orders of the stream and separately calculated the cumulative stream length traveled for each strahler order of streams the last segment is the reservoir sink into which all the cell sources flow 3 2 validation of the framework fig 7 illustrates the goodness of fit of our calculations to measurements at the catchment scale in general the total estimated tdn loading and removal in waterways agreed well with the measurements for both stream and pond sites fig 7 our calculations could explain more than 90 of the variation in loading and removal which suggests that our calculations correctly represented the main drivers of n loading and removal in waterways we then compared our removal calculation with the mass balance method and regression model method at the watershed scale li et al 2013 as shown in table 1 the annual estimated n removal in the jurong reservoir watershed was 7 4 20 7 and 21 1 tons for stream pond and reservoir respectively not only the estimated n removal values in stream pond and reservoir but also the total n removal values in our calculation were comparable with those estimated by the mass balance and regression method 3 3 spatial patterns of nitrogen loading based on s t o w w i in our framework we can provide a detailed estimation for spatially explicit n loading across the jurong reservoir watershed firstly the cumulative area for aws and cumulative length for lws along the flow direction for each cell were calculated based on the method of geographic parameters identification as shown in fig 8 the cumulative overland length traveled for each cell varied from 0 to 1099 m before reaching the stream while the cumulative pond area traveled for each cell varied from 0 to 58 995 m2s for the subsequent travel length in the stream network each cell had great variation in different order streams which ranged from 0 to 3283 0 2672 0 6991 and 0 4367 m from the first order to the fourth order stream respectively as all the cell sources finally flowed into the reservoir all the cell sources had the same travel area of the reservoir based on the cumulative area or length of each segment sink along the flow direction and pathway for each grid cell source the biological removal parameters for each water sink and upland n release calculation we then calculated the tdn loading through the network of waters for each cell source as shown in fig 9 the tdn discharged from cropland was 71 6 tons while the final tdn loading to the outlet of the watershed was 20 9 tons after being removed by ditches 0 3 9 kg n ha in total 1 5 tons then by ponds 0 to 34 9 kg n ha in total 20 7 tons four orders of streams 0 to 25 9 kg n ha in total 7 4 tons and finally by the reservoir 0 to 34 kg n ha in total 21 1 tons 3 4 spatial patterns of nitrogen removal based on w t o s w in our framework we calculated a detailed estimation for spatially explicit n removal for each water body as shown in fig 10 our results showed that n removal by pond varied from less than 10 kg n year to greater than 1000 kg n year throughout the watershed fig 10a the pond with high n loading typically removed a large proportion of the tdn the total tdn removal 20 7 tons in ponds was same as that of s t o w w i although the calculation method is different when including the pond area into calculation the average removal rate ranged from less than 10 kg n ha to greater than 100 kg n ha compared with the irregular distribution in tdn removal layout for pond water stream water had an increased removal rate downstream the n removal by stream section varied from less than 10 kg n year in the first order stream to more than 500 kg n year in the fourth order stream throughout the watershed fig 10b the total tdn removal 7 4 tons in streams was the same as that of s t o w w i although the calculation method is different when including stream length into the calculation the average removal rate ranged from less than 10 kg n km to more than 1000 kg n km 4 advantages and limitations of the new framework 4 1 advantages of our new framework we included small water bodies and their detailed topology structures as the core of nutrient retention and transfer in our watershed simulation despite dominating the size distribution of global fresh water bodies biggs et al 2017 smith et al 2002 these water bodies are often overlooked in hydrographical databases leading to an incomplete understanding of their impacts on watershed processes hansen et al 2018 berg et al 2016 recent studies have highlighted the importance of these small waters in nutrient processing and retention with their hydrological connectivity being a key factor in determining their role within the landscape chen et al 2020 czuba et al 2018 hansen et al 2018 xia and yan 2020 the location and magnitude of source areas connected to a specific water body by surface and subsurface transport pathways are critical in determining its nutrient retention capacity while previous studies have incorporated river networks to estimate nutrient delivery downstream these studies did not explicitly include isolated wetlands which can change connectivity spatially and over time heasley et al 2019 helton et al 2011 liu et al 2008 other studies have attempted to estimate nutrient retention through a direct consideration of spatial positioning of individual water bodies along a river network but this approach is limited in its spatial precision cheng et al 2020 xia and yan 2020 therefore to fully understand nutrient delivery and interaction in an entire watershed it is crucial to have a deep understanding of the topology structure which aggregates the path specific connectivity retention characteristics across all isolated water bodies and river networks that enter the watershed outlet czuba et al 2018 developed a network based framework that quantified nutrient retention in a wetland river network explicitly incorporating both connected and isolated water bodies and capturing hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions however this framework does not account for the ditch structure and some multi pond systems which can temporally hold water and are mostly invisible in the network ditches and ponds are often integral components of agricultural irrigated systems which are designed to irrigate or drain excess water from the fields chen et al 2020 they also act as major pathways of surface and subsurface flow nutrients from agricultural lands to receiving waters chen et al 2015 sun et al 2021 especially when vegetated ecological ditches are used in best management practices bmps soana et al 2017 our flexible framework is capable of efficiently accommodating dynamic changes in the landscape which can initiate a cascade of nutrient transfer and retention that will propagate throughout the watershed for example in many chinese agricultural landscapes historical nature artificial water bodies have been transitioned from water storage for irrigation to aquaculture zhou et al 2022 thereby shifting from nutrient sinks to sources the terrestrial landscape itself has transitioned from traditional agriculture firstly to intensified agriculture and finally now to being an urban environment along with an increase in nutrient releases xia et al 2016 in our framework we can easily adjust the corresponding parameters and reestablish the topology structure of the grid source and water sink to reflect these changes previous efforts have not been as effective as desired because the spatial context and cascading effects of water bodies have not been adequately addressed however our newly developed topology structure and indexes can now reveal these effects 4 2 limitations and potential improvements this study is a first step toward quantifying how a suite of small water bodies interact dynamically within a hierarchically nested water body to dictate nutrient transfer and removal at the watershed scale by combining a simple representation of hydrological and biogeochemical processes with topology structure we have developed a framework that captures the basic behavior of nutrient transport and removal in a spatially complex watershed to more comprehensively quantify nutrient dynamics in water bodies across the entire landscape future applications could explicitly include surface water hydraulics such as water velocity to identify the conjunctive roles of hydrological properties controlling nutrient removal in water bodies wollheim et al 2006 furthermore the incorporation of geometric characteristics and human activity could further enhance the capabilities of complex watershed simulation maavara et al 2020 although our framework can fully evaluate the spatial details in nutrient transport and removal it is limited in representing temporal variation in the nutrient process which is controlled by biological climatic and physical factors including storm runoff conditions braskerud 2002 organic carbon availability czuba et al 2018 and combinations of vegetation assimilation nutrient deposition nutrient releases from sediments chen et al 2021 nevertheless the benefits of using topology structure in our model help us obtain parameters effectively explicitly incorporate water bodies into the network and capture hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions this approach has been instrumental in developing ecological theory in other areas such as sediment transport borselli et al 2008 sumaiya et al 2021 hydrologic connectivity golden et al 2014 and geomorphology heasley et al 2019 our analysis used a simple topology structure to represent basic biogeochemical and hydrological impacts of the water body on nutrient dynamics and contributes to developing the theoretical and general principles underlying the nutrient processes in a watershed 5 implications our proposed framework offers a parsimonious solution for watershed modeling that is based on physical and spatial distributions the multiple processes of the watershed models are typically represented by a small spatial support usually a grid cell which can be computationally demanding owing to the large number of model parameters ouyang et al 2017 this introduces substantial uncertainty into model applications because of the availability or lack thereof of data for such a vast number of parameters as a result watershed modeling has shifted from single complex comprehensive models to modular systems with multiple simple model components liu et al 2008 tavakoly et al 2019 in which the watershed transfer model forms the core of a simulation framework our watershed transfer model is similar to graph based approaches chen et al 2014 kellogg et al 2010 liu et al 2008 tavakoly et al 2016 however our framework includes the full source and sink structures as well as the stream network moreover we incorporate different biological removal parameters for different water bodies which support higher resolution for simulations of temporal and spatial nutrient release and retention depending on the purpose of the research our framework can be easily integrated into watershed nutrient models with other component models loosely coupled and these can be added or removed without much effort our new framework is simple and computationally efficient and can be applied wherever water bodies structure land uses and dem maps are available with no constraint on the size of water bodies thus it potentially provides the type of modeling tool required for environmental assessment and management of broad landscapes for example by tracing nutrient sources through water pathways our new framework can guide local management of watershed nutrients by targeting upland source controls and by identifying landscape sinks for protection and or restoration by including the size location and removal parameters of multiple water bodies for nutrient export reduction at the watershed scale our framework provides the basis on which comparative analyses can be performed of the water quality benefits and trade offs of wetland protection and restoration relative to other management options in agricultural landscapes similarly our framework could show how re incorporating sources and sinks into intensively managed agricultural watersheds would reduce riverine nutrient loading and contribute to improving local water quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following

14784,small water bodies such as interval water flooded ditches ponds and streams serve as important nutrient sinks in many landscapes especially in the multi water continuum system yet watershed nutrient cycling models often fail to or insufficiently capture these waters resulting in great uncertainty in quantifying the distributed transfer and retention of nutrients across diverse landscapes in a watershed in this study we present a network based predictive framework of the nutrient transport process in nested small water bodies which incorporates topology structure hydrological and biogeochemical processes and connectivity to perform a nonlinear and distributed scaling of nutrient transfer and retention the framework was validated and applied to n transport in a multi water continuum watershed in the yangtze river basin we show that the importance of n loading and retention depends on the spatial context of grid source and water bodies because of the great variation in location connectivity and water types our results demonstrate that hotspots in nutrient loading and retention could be accurately and efficiently identified through hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions this offers an effective approach for the reduction of watershed scale nutrient loads this framework can be used in modeling to identify where and how to restore small water bodies for reduced non point pollution from agricultural watersheds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords small water bodies topology structure nutrient loading and retention model framework multi water continuum system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction small water bodies such as ditches ponds streams dominate the distribution of global freshwater and play a crucial role in nutrient removal during nutrient transport along the aquatic continuum from landscape to ocean cheng and basu 2017 according to a model analysis based on a high resolution dataset in the northeastern united states small ponds are collectively responsible for 34 69 and 12 of the mean annual retention of nitrogen phosphorus and sediment respectively schmadel et al 2019 taking the pond stream reservoir continuum as an example up to 83 4 of total aquatic n was estimated to be removed during small waterways transport in a rice dominated watershed in eastern china li et al 2013 the hotspots of nutrient removal in small water bodies have been broadly reported and concluded to be the inverse relationship between removal rate constants and water size because of the decreasing contact area to volume ratios with the increase in stream size alexander et al 2000 cheng and basu 2017 despite the importance of small water bodies to nutrient retention there is great variability in the capacity of individual water body to remove nutrients for example five watersheds in the mississippi river basin with similar crop covers and non ephemeral water bodies showed distinct nitrate removal fractions with a wetland that intercepts 100 of the drainage area being three times more effective than one that intercepts 50 of the drainage area hansen et al 2018 the variation in nutrient retention is related to the time nutrient spends in contact with benthic surfaces with removal efficiency generally scaling with water size location and depth alexander et al 2000 boyer et al 2006 schmadel et al 2019 based on a clear conceptual model xia and yan 2020 quantified the importance of water size and spatial location to nutrient retention the spatial patterning of water bodies particularly their spatial location plays a crucial role in determining the nutrient removal potential for a suite of water bodies within a watershed weller et al 1998 xia and yan 2020 therefore understanding the structure of water networks is essential to improve nutrient retention modeling at a watershed scale since they play important roles in the physical chemical and biological processes of nutrients cheng et al 2020 although water network structure is known to be crucial for nutrient retention research on watershed nutrient cycling is limited by insufficient representation of spatial patterns of water bodies in modeling recent studies have attempted to quantify the effects of a hierarchical network of nested water bodies using various approaches including dynamic connectivity czuba et al 2018 hansen et al 2018 network topology heasley et al 2019 individual location hansen et al 2018 and geography metrics xia and yan 2020 however these approaches have limitations such as the explicit mapping wetland connectivity to the river network which does not easily allow consideration of geographically isolated wetlands czuba et al 2018 hansen et al 2018 furthermore some studies have estimated nutrient retention in isolated water bodies by simply aggregating the nutrient retention of all isolated small water bodies within the watershed without considering location effects of small water bodies cheng et al 2020 our recent study attempted to estimate nutrient retention in small water bodies through direct consideration of geography metrics such as mean size distance to the stream and evenness of location xia and yan 2020 however this conceptual approach is limited by the lack of detailed topological structure between landscapes that captures hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions the insufficient representation of spatial patterns of small water bodies may result in great uncertainty in quantifying the distributed transfer and retention of nutrients across diverse landscapes in a small multi water bodies continuum watershed the focus of this paper is on the detailed topology structure of diverse landscapes including small water bodies for a new application in modeling the distributed transfer and retention of nutrients along the aquatic continuum in a multi water watershed a new framework is presented that accounts for the hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions between the individual small water bodies and upland sources the framework is then applied to the multi water jurong watershed and its validity is tested at both catchment and watershed scales by using this framework we demonstrate how the interactive effects of small water bodies influence the distributed transfer and retention of nutrients the ultimate goal is to develop a new framework that can be used to assess where and how to restore small water bodies for optimal water quality benefits in multi water bodies continuum watersheds 2 new framework development and parameterization 2 1 development of the new framework the proposed framework shown in fig 1 integrates the concept of topology structure and hydrological connectivity that quantifies nutrient retention and transfer through an interacting upland water body connected network we assume that released nutrients flow downhill from the cropland through overland runoff or ditches and ponds and probably again through ditches and ponds and then enter a stream network finally reaching a reservoir or lake in a nested small water bodies continuum a watershed could be divided into w sub watersheds according to w water bodies fig 1 we use a subscript w for each source s w i to identify the sequence of the water body and its associated subwatershed according to its position and pathway the subscript w is designed to reflect the routing of a source and forms the basis of important hydrographical indicators of its topological structure hydrological connectivity is a broad term that has been used in various contexts owing in part to the varying influence that hydrologic connectivity has on a wide variety of watershed processes of physical and biological importance here we referred to the definition from wohl et al 2019 that the connectivity is the efficiency of the transfer of nutrients between water bodies the connectivity includes structural and dynamic functional components where the spatial patterns are the structural connectivity and the dynamic connectivity relates to the changes in these spatial patterns with time singh and sinha 2019 wainwright et al 2011 based on the spatio temporal characteristics of nutrient transfer and retention we distinguish two kinds of waterways isolated areal water bodies aw and interconnected linear water bodies lw isolated areal water bodies located away from rivers such as ponds reservoirs and wetlands are connected episodically or only via the subsurface cohen et al 2016 the final quantity of the nutrient load depends on the residence time and retention efficiency of lw and aw through which the nutrients pass residence time in aw depends mainly on water area and depth interconnected linear water bodies are ditches streams and river networks sometimes connected with reservoirs and lakes where residence time depends mainly on the length and the slope nutrient retention efficiency for aw is significantly different from that of lw because of their small size with high perimeter length per unit area low flow velocity and the first landscape flush of solutes cohen et al 2016 semlitsch and bodie 1998 the value of differentiating these two water bodies is to better represent nutrient retention by simple geometric and geographic parameters we defined and distinguished two kinds of connectivity indexes to represent transfer and retention 1 loading of nonpoint sources to waters s t o w w i this index is used to calculate the loading of the ith source of the wth subwatershed to each water along the pathway which takes into account both the source strength and removal fraction along the waterway the removal fraction is related to the location and removal efficiency of the water body through which the nutrients pass which increases with respect to increasing water area or flow path length because of the long residence time for nutrients each of the released nutrient masses from uplands s w i will be retained successively by lw r l and aw r a along the flow path an additional quantity of the source will be removed if there are more than one lw and more aw in the pathway of the source 1 sto w w i s w i r l 1 r a 1 r l 2 r a 2 r ln r am s w i j 1 n r lj k 1 m r ak where r l and r a are released fractions of the nutrients received by lw and aw respectively we calculate the released factor of nutrients during water transport r l r a by letting each unit of travel time t have a dynamic removal rate k of the nutrient it receives cheng and basu 2017 the calculation of k includes the importance of water size location and water type as described in the next section xia and yan 2020 for evaluating the travel time t l of the nutrient from a given grid i the travel times into all similar waters that are localized along the path between the ith unit and the terminal water reached can be summed 2 r exp k t for lw the travel time is assumed to increase as the length l i of the hydraulic path increases and as the square root of the average slope of the hydraulic path decreases ferro and porto 2000 this gives 3 t l l v l i l c r i l 2 3 s i l 1 n j 1 n l i j r i j 2 3 s i j in which n is the number of linear water bodies localized along the hydraulic path i l i j r i j and s i j are the length hydraulic radius and average slope of each source i localized to water j along the hydraulic path respectively according to chezy s uniform open channel flow equation cardoso et al 1989 c is chezy s constant which is related to manning s roughness coefficient n between 0 02 and 0 05 r is hydraulic radius or hydraulic depth calculated by dividing the water flow s cross sectional area by the wetted perimeter of lw to avoid infinite in the equation we opted 0 005 for the minimum slope value for aw the travel time depends on the total area of the water a a through which the nutrients pass cheng and basu 2017 as the upland source would travel a chain of areal waters in the watershed the total travel time t a in aw depends on the cumulative area of waters passed through by the nutrients 4 t a β 1 a a β 2 β 1 j 1 m a aj β 2 where β 1 1 50 β 2 0 23 are the coefficients derived from a meta analysis of different small water bodies across the world cheng and basu 2017 a aj is the water area of the m water body passed combining the above equations we can integrate s t o w w i with general properties of the landscape based on gis data and the biogeochemical reaction processes in water bodies 5 sto w w i s w i

which is defined as the internal linkages between the loading from nutrient sources in the upper parts of the water body and the discharging to the water body downstream w t o s w takes into account the strength of nutrient loading and removal by the water body which includes the retention efficiency water position and water size xia and yan 2020 water size determines the travel time in the water body for all nutrient sources in the drainage area water location determines the strength of sources loaded and the structure between sources and water bodies if there are other water bodies between the sources and the water body removal by these water bodies has to be included again the removal is calculated by nutrient sources in the upper parts of catchments and the corresponding sink characteristics for the downstream water bodies that source flow from one to the next w t o s w also decreases with the increase of water size above as the bigger water volume above has more residence time and removal potential 6 w t o s w i 1 n s w i 1 r w f o r w 1 7 w t o s w r w 1 1 r w 1 c w s w 1 j 1 m s w j 1 r w f o r w 1 where 1 r w is the fraction of the nutrients removed by the wth water body the water body could be a linear water body r l or an areal water body r a as calculated above if the water body is the first order or the outermost of the watershed all sources loading s w i into the subwatershed will be equally removed if the water body is not in the outermost of the subwatershed the discharge from the water body upstream r w 1 1 r w 1 c w s w 1 and other sources s w j in the subwatershed will be equally removed and so on the index calculation above is grid based which includes both geographic parameters and biogeochemical reaction parameters the geographic parameters of s i j l i j a aj could be simply obtained or calculated using standard gis software such as arcgis hydraulic radius r is calculated based on the catchment area to lw width for simplicity and cost efficient calculation we let water flow at a depth equal to the hydraulic radius according to the lw channel dimensions https www omnicalculator com however it is difficult to identify j 1 m a aj and j 1 m l i j s i j and k a k l for aw and lw below we describe a detailed procedure to quantify these geographic parameters and biological removal factors 2 2 geographic parameters identification in calculating the loading of nutrient sources to water bodies s t o w w i the deterministic eight node d8 method is used to identify the cumulative area of aws and cumulative length of lws along the flow direction for each cell to integrate similar water bodies for simple implementation and computational efficiency the calculation procedures for aws and lws are a little different because of their differences in a nested structure for aws the cumulative area of aws and cumulative length of episodically lws between aws are calculated separately fig 2 we use the recursive traversal and design the following steps to calculate j 1 m a aj and j 1 m l i j s i j for each grid cell source 1 setting the watershed boundary for calculation homogeneous lws and aws are united respectively by setting a distinguishing raster value for example rivers are greatly diverse in retention efficiency but rivers with the same strahler order are generally similar in retention efficiency for unit river length in the same watershed and correspondingly could be coded with the same value and gathered together for further analysis 2 each grid cell in lw is initially assigned one accumulated lw length unit and the first cell is then selected for processing 3 the slope of the selected cell except for the ones located on the edge of the watershed is computed for its eight neighbor nodes based on a digital elevation model dem once the greater positive slope is identified the cell receives a specific coding that identifies the downstream cell 4 if the downstream cell intercepts with aw the area of the water body will be recorded and added to the grid or else the length and slope of the cell will be recorded and added to the grid the downstream cell or water body is marked as checked 5 the next cell of the grid is selected if there are any unchecked cells or water bodies downstream and step 2 is repeated step 3 is continued until the preceding cell intercepts with the terminal water body cells 6 the algorithm continues until all the cells in the watershed are processed and the accumulated flow length and area for each grid allow the calculation of the lw release r l and aw release r a from their respective predefined release fractions for lws the cumulative lengths for different orders are calculated respectively fig 3 the calculation procedure is similar to that for aw above but in step 4 when the downstream cells intercept with another order lw the travel length of the water will be recorded and added for the grid in calculating the retention of a water body to nonpoint sources w t o s w the calculations for lw and aw are a little different in their topological structure for lws such as river networks the topological structure between river sections is typically known so we need only to build the topological structure between the lws and upland sources fig 4 however for aws the topological structure between them is often unknown which means that both the topological structure between aws and the topological structure between aws and upland sources must be developed fig 5 we developed the following algorithm in arcgis without i o operations to calculate w t o s w for the lw and aw 1 for each linear or areal water body the watershed tool is used to identify the catchment of the water body and the water body is then marked as checked 2 the catchment raster identified above converts to a polygon and intersection analysis is used to record the contributing grid sources and water bodies 3 the next water body is selected and steps 1 and 2 are repeated until a headwater or the outermost water body is found after all water bodies are processed we identify the contributing grid sources and water bodies for each water body 4 if there is more than one water body in the catchment we sort them into a descending order according to their location by comparing their dem values 5 the release and removal of each water body are calculated in order based on the predefined release fractions 6 the algorithm continues until all the water bodies in the watershed are processed and the release and removal of each water body have been integrated 2 3 biological removal parameters biological removal includes temporary removal for example plant uptake burial and permanent removal for example denitrification anammox processes which depend on a variety of factors including nutrient loading water body types respiration rates and contact time of the water with sediments alexander et al 2000 boyer et al 2006 despite such complexity and the heterogeneity of processes across a variety of aw and lw studies simple and available geomorphic parameters have been broadly used to represent the dynamic removal rate k t reflecting the aggregate net effects of physical hydrological and biochemical properties alexander et al 2000 cheng et al 2020 ensign and doyle 2006 for aws the meta analysis showed a remarkably consistent and significant relationship between the first order nutrient removal rate k a and the water retention time t a which was validated by a sediment water model that links major nutrient removal processes with water size cheng and basu 2017 8 k a c a t a d a where c a and d a for different nutrients tn no3 nh4 tp could be derived from cheng and basu 2017 by a meta analysis of 178 wetlands across the world for lws using water depth as an explanatory variable produced the best first order decay rate k l predictions with long term streamflow and water quality data gathered from measured streams in the northeastern united states alexander et al 2000 2007 9 k l c l d d l where d mean water depth m c l 0 051 and d l 1 319 water depth is expressed as a simple function of mean annual stream flow q m3 s if the measurement of water depth is not available for some river sections which is based on flow data from 374 monitoring stations in the usa alexander et al 2000 10 d 0 2396 q 0 4363 where stream discharge q is again estimated using a popular curve number method scs cn method that includes soil and land use vegetative cover characteristics of the watershed satheeshkumar et al 2017 the curve number method was developed in the 1960s by the usda soil conservation service scs now the natural resources conservation service and has since become established as a popular ubiquitous and enduring means of estimating storm runoff from rainfall events thus the dynamic first order nutrient removal rate can be simply estimated using the spatial surface area of the aw and stream flow data of lw applied to each reach below we illustrate our approach by estimating the distributed nitrogen transfer and retention in a watershed with combined lws and aws 3 application of the new framework 3 1 watershed and data we chose the jurong reservoir watershed in the lower reaches of yangtze river basin as a case study because of the existing small multi water bodies with high resolution 10 m resolution lisar data fig 6 which are described in detail by yan et al 2011 briefly the watershed located 40 km southeast of nanjing in china s jiangsu province 32 01 n 119 13 e fig 6 is 45 5 km2 and a typical agricultural watershed with rice paddies and cultivated upland accounting for 32 2 and 22 8 of the total area respectively there are one reservoir three main streams and thousands of small ponds that occupy 8 2 of the watershed area the three streams join the reservoir at the lowest part of the watershed the mean annual air temperature and precipitation are 15 c and 1050 mm respectively there is no industry or intensive livestock farming in the watershed and no human or livestock waste is directly discharged into waterways yan et al 2011 we validated our n loading and removal estimation through waterways at two scales one is a catchment scale with measurements of five pond sites and six stream sites and the other is a watershed scale with annual estimated n removal by the pond stream and reservoir with regression models as shown in fig 6 the selected five ponds belong to one subwatershed with each pond having a different catchment area and topological relationship to the water bodies the catchments of the first and the fourth ponds have no other ponds inside while the catchments of the second third and fifth have other ponds inside in addition the catchments of the third and fifth ponds contain the catchments of the second and the fourth ponds respectively the selected six river sites are located in the three main streams with three of these sites in the central two in the western streams and one in the eastern stream xia and yan 2020 as the purpose of this study was to model the transfer and retention of nutrients in waterways transport nutrient export from the upland was estimated based on an improved export coefficient model and budget study in a simple way yan et al 2011 wang et al 2014 here we took total dissolved nitrogen tdn as a case nutrient because it is probably more accessible to removal in transport the applied export coefficient model describes the dynamic process of tdn export from the field as the function of n budget and hydrology for different land uses which was fully validated in the yangtze river basin during 1970 2003 wang et al 2014 nitrogen budget was conducted both at the subwatershed and watershed scales based on intensive monitoring of stream and pond n dynamics measurements atmospheric deposition ammonia nh3 volatilization and household interviews about n related agricultural activities yan et al 2011 besides nutrient export from the upland we also included atmospheric dry and wet deposition to water bodies based on our previous measurements yan et al 2011 nitrogen removal in water bodies is scaled to the catchment and watershed based on sediment denitrification measurements li et al 2013 there are three processes related to n removal in water bodies including denitrification biological absorption and sedimentation as there are few plants and fishes in these water bodies absorption by biology was not included in the long run sedimentation is almost balanced with the release of sediment denitrification is one of the most important parts of n reduction in water bodies because it can remove n permanently from the aquatic cycle seitzinger et al 2006 our previous studies have shown that n removal via denitrification could account for as much as 83 4 of total retained tdn li et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 briefly net sediment denitrification rates of these sites five pond sites and six stream sites were directly measured and the key factors that control net sediment denitrification were determined every 2 months between november 2010 and december 2011 net sediment n2 fluxes net sediment denitrification rates were determined by membrane inlet mass spectrometry and the n2 ar technique kana et al 1994 linear regression and linear mixed effect model analysis showed that no3 concentration and temperature in surface water were the primary controlling factors for net sediment denitrification which accounted for 86 variation in denitrification rates using monitoring data on no3 concentrations and temperature of the surface water of waterways and an established linear mixed effect model tdn removed from the ponds and stream was estimated li et al 2013 we further used the framework model the spatial patterns of n loading and removal along the multi water continuum system based on geographic parameters identification the successive n transfer and removal for each grid source through each water body to the outlet was calculated by tracking the length in lws or area in aws and its removal rate in the jurong reservoir watershed the flow path of water bodies from any cell source to the watershed outlet is divided into seven segments the first segment is from cell source to stream while not in a pond noted as overland flow or ditch sink the second segment is the pond sink from the cell source to the stream in which all the passed ponds are included to include the great difference in n removal between stream orders we further differentiated four orders of the stream and separately calculated the cumulative stream length traveled for each strahler order of streams the last segment is the reservoir sink into which all the cell sources flow 3 2 validation of the framework fig 7 illustrates the goodness of fit of our calculations to measurements at the catchment scale in general the total estimated tdn loading and removal in waterways agreed well with the measurements for both stream and pond sites fig 7 our calculations could explain more than 90 of the variation in loading and removal which suggests that our calculations correctly represented the main drivers of n loading and removal in waterways we then compared our removal calculation with the mass balance method and regression model method at the watershed scale li et al 2013 as shown in table 1 the annual estimated n removal in the jurong reservoir watershed was 7 4 20 7 and 21 1 tons for stream pond and reservoir respectively not only the estimated n removal values in stream pond and reservoir but also the total n removal values in our calculation were comparable with those estimated by the mass balance and regression method 3 3 spatial patterns of nitrogen loading based on s t o w w i in our framework we can provide a detailed estimation for spatially explicit n loading across the jurong reservoir watershed firstly the cumulative area for aws and cumulative length for lws along the flow direction for each cell were calculated based on the method of geographic parameters identification as shown in fig 8 the cumulative overland length traveled for each cell varied from 0 to 1099 m before reaching the stream while the cumulative pond area traveled for each cell varied from 0 to 58 995 m2s for the subsequent travel length in the stream network each cell had great variation in different order streams which ranged from 0 to 3283 0 2672 0 6991 and 0 4367 m from the first order to the fourth order stream respectively as all the cell sources finally flowed into the reservoir all the cell sources had the same travel area of the reservoir based on the cumulative area or length of each segment sink along the flow direction and pathway for each grid cell source the biological removal parameters for each water sink and upland n release calculation we then calculated the tdn loading through the network of waters for each cell source as shown in fig 9 the tdn discharged from cropland was 71 6 tons while the final tdn loading to the outlet of the watershed was 20 9 tons after being removed by ditches 0 3 9 kg n ha in total 1 5 tons then by ponds 0 to 34 9 kg n ha in total 20 7 tons four orders of streams 0 to 25 9 kg n ha in total 7 4 tons and finally by the reservoir 0 to 34 kg n ha in total 21 1 tons 3 4 spatial patterns of nitrogen removal based on w t o s w in our framework we calculated a detailed estimation for spatially explicit n removal for each water body as shown in fig 10 our results showed that n removal by pond varied from less than 10 kg n year to greater than 1000 kg n year throughout the watershed fig 10a the pond with high n loading typically removed a large proportion of the tdn the total tdn removal 20 7 tons in ponds was same as that of s t o w w i although the calculation method is different when including the pond area into calculation the average removal rate ranged from less than 10 kg n ha to greater than 100 kg n ha compared with the irregular distribution in tdn removal layout for pond water stream water had an increased removal rate downstream the n removal by stream section varied from less than 10 kg n year in the first order stream to more than 500 kg n year in the fourth order stream throughout the watershed fig 10b the total tdn removal 7 4 tons in streams was the same as that of s t o w w i although the calculation method is different when including stream length into the calculation the average removal rate ranged from less than 10 kg n km to more than 1000 kg n km 4 advantages and limitations of the new framework 4 1 advantages of our new framework we included small water bodies and their detailed topology structures as the core of nutrient retention and transfer in our watershed simulation despite dominating the size distribution of global fresh water bodies biggs et al 2017 smith et al 2002 these water bodies are often overlooked in hydrographical databases leading to an incomplete understanding of their impacts on watershed processes hansen et al 2018 berg et al 2016 recent studies have highlighted the importance of these small waters in nutrient processing and retention with their hydrological connectivity being a key factor in determining their role within the landscape chen et al 2020 czuba et al 2018 hansen et al 2018 xia and yan 2020 the location and magnitude of source areas connected to a specific water body by surface and subsurface transport pathways are critical in determining its nutrient retention capacity while previous studies have incorporated river networks to estimate nutrient delivery downstream these studies did not explicitly include isolated wetlands which can change connectivity spatially and over time heasley et al 2019 helton et al 2011 liu et al 2008 other studies have attempted to estimate nutrient retention through a direct consideration of spatial positioning of individual water bodies along a river network but this approach is limited in its spatial precision cheng et al 2020 xia and yan 2020 therefore to fully understand nutrient delivery and interaction in an entire watershed it is crucial to have a deep understanding of the topology structure which aggregates the path specific connectivity retention characteristics across all isolated water bodies and river networks that enter the watershed outlet czuba et al 2018 developed a network based framework that quantified nutrient retention in a wetland river network explicitly incorporating both connected and isolated water bodies and capturing hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions however this framework does not account for the ditch structure and some multi pond systems which can temporally hold water and are mostly invisible in the network ditches and ponds are often integral components of agricultural irrigated systems which are designed to irrigate or drain excess water from the fields chen et al 2020 they also act as major pathways of surface and subsurface flow nutrients from agricultural lands to receiving waters chen et al 2015 sun et al 2021 especially when vegetated ecological ditches are used in best management practices bmps soana et al 2017 our flexible framework is capable of efficiently accommodating dynamic changes in the landscape which can initiate a cascade of nutrient transfer and retention that will propagate throughout the watershed for example in many chinese agricultural landscapes historical nature artificial water bodies have been transitioned from water storage for irrigation to aquaculture zhou et al 2022 thereby shifting from nutrient sinks to sources the terrestrial landscape itself has transitioned from traditional agriculture firstly to intensified agriculture and finally now to being an urban environment along with an increase in nutrient releases xia et al 2016 in our framework we can easily adjust the corresponding parameters and reestablish the topology structure of the grid source and water sink to reflect these changes previous efforts have not been as effective as desired because the spatial context and cascading effects of water bodies have not been adequately addressed however our newly developed topology structure and indexes can now reveal these effects 4 2 limitations and potential improvements this study is a first step toward quantifying how a suite of small water bodies interact dynamically within a hierarchically nested water body to dictate nutrient transfer and removal at the watershed scale by combining a simple representation of hydrological and biogeochemical processes with topology structure we have developed a framework that captures the basic behavior of nutrient transport and removal in a spatially complex watershed to more comprehensively quantify nutrient dynamics in water bodies across the entire landscape future applications could explicitly include surface water hydraulics such as water velocity to identify the conjunctive roles of hydrological properties controlling nutrient removal in water bodies wollheim et al 2006 furthermore the incorporation of geometric characteristics and human activity could further enhance the capabilities of complex watershed simulation maavara et al 2020 although our framework can fully evaluate the spatial details in nutrient transport and removal it is limited in representing temporal variation in the nutrient process which is controlled by biological climatic and physical factors including storm runoff conditions braskerud 2002 organic carbon availability czuba et al 2018 and combinations of vegetation assimilation nutrient deposition nutrient releases from sediments chen et al 2021 nevertheless the benefits of using topology structure in our model help us obtain parameters effectively explicitly incorporate water bodies into the network and capture hierarchical network effects and spatial interactions this approach has been instrumental in developing ecological theory in other areas such as sediment transport borselli et al 2008 sumaiya et al 2021 hydrologic connectivity golden et al 2014 and geomorphology heasley et al 2019 our analysis used a simple topology structure to represent basic biogeochemical and hydrological impacts of the water body on nutrient dynamics and contributes to developing the theoretical and general principles underlying the nutrient processes in a watershed 5 implications our proposed framework offers a parsimonious solution for watershed modeling that is based on physical and spatial distributions the multiple processes of the watershed models are typically represented by a small spatial support usually a grid cell which can be computationally demanding owing to the large number of model parameters ouyang et al 2017 this introduces substantial uncertainty into model applications because of the availability or lack thereof of data for such a vast number of parameters as a result watershed modeling has shifted from single complex comprehensive models to modular systems with multiple simple model components liu et al 2008 tavakoly et al 2019 in which the watershed transfer model forms the core of a simulation framework our watershed transfer model is similar to graph based approaches chen et al 2014 kellogg et al 2010 liu et al 2008 tavakoly et al 2016 however our framework includes the full source and sink structures as well as the stream network moreover we incorporate different biological removal parameters for different water bodies which support higher resolution for simulations of temporal and spatial nutrient release and retention depending on the purpose of the research our framework can be easily integrated into watershed nutrient models with other component models loosely coupled and these can be added or removed without much effort our new framework is simple and computationally efficient and can be applied wherever water bodies structure land uses and dem maps are available with no constraint on the size of water bodies thus it potentially provides the type of modeling tool required for environmental assessment and management of broad landscapes for example by tracing nutrient sources through water pathways our new framework can guide local management of watershed nutrients by targeting upland source controls and by identifying landscape sinks for protection and or restoration by including the size location and removal parameters of multiple water bodies for nutrient export reduction at the watershed scale our framework provides the basis on which comparative analyses can be performed of the water quality benefits and trade offs of wetland protection and restoration relative to other management options in agricultural landscapes similarly our framework could show how re incorporating sources and sinks into intensively managed agricultural watersheds would reduce riverine nutrient loading and contribute to improving local water quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following
