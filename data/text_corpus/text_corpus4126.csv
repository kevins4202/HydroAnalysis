20630,prior studies have revealed that capsizing and sinking of bulk carriers with highly viscous liquefied cargoes is primarily caused by a collapse of viscous shear forces as the inertial forces of the liquefied cargoes are greater than the viscous shear forces during rolling induced by oblique waves specifically as vessels sailing along the north south oriented coasts experiencing ne or nw winds in wintertime post investigations show that this occurs only when a cargo shift takes place in all cargo holds for a typical nickel ore bulk carrier with five cargo holds nevertheless the studies on partial cargo shifts remain poorly understood although the partial cargo shifts are not likely to lead to a catastrophic consequence it can result in a dangerous list of a few degrees for bulk carriers many marine accidents with the partial cargo shifts have been reported over the past decade the instantaneous impact loads including the horizontal sectional loads and torsional moments previously ignored by many marine engineers but subsequently identified by us are actually enormous usually resulting in not only a list of ships but also obvious or potential damage to ship s structures and deck fittings traditional methods are difficult to predict and calculate these exceptional loads here we address the horizontal sectional loads and torsional moments in oblique waves at a variety of cargo shift situations using improved arbitrary lagrange euler method and finite volume method the results obtained from the numerical methods are well in agreement with those acquired from the model tests implying that the numerical simulations are more suitable for capturing and tracking the complex surface of fluid sloshing with high viscosity keywords nickel ore liquefaction partial cargo shift instantaneous impact load torsional moment structural damage 1 introduction considerable ships with highly viscous liquefied cargoes such as nickel ore have capsized and sunk due to a strong sloshing induced cargo shift over the past years nk class 2012 nevertheless from the reported marine accident cases some ships with nickel ores still remain fundamentally upright despite suffering heavy sloshing with a list of 6 15 only for instance vessel padang hawk with liquefied nickel ore in all five cargo holds had a severe list of 15 to port induced by a partial cargo shift in the 1st 4th cargo holds and was difficult also dangerous owing to a possible re collapse of the viscous shear forces to resume to a state of equilibrium by shifting its own ballast waters into tanks in the other side atsb 2000 vessel chang hang rui hai with full load of highly viscous liquefied ore experienced a slight list of 6 to port due to cargo shifts in the 1st 2nd cargo holds of three cargo holds zzmsa 2013 according to some post investigations conducted by local maritime safety administrations msa and class societies among those listed ships many have not yet reported to international maritime organization imo owing to various reasons cnmsa 2017 the instantaneous impact loads and torsion induced buckling damage to structures and fittings of ships widely exists such as hatch coaming deformations hatch corner cracking stiffener bending or breaking hull girder distortions etc not only leading to difficulties in hatch cover opening closing but also resulting in a final unseaworthiness even worse some potential interior damage of torsion induced warping stresses to the ultimate hull girder strength remains invisible and unclear challenging the safety of ships seafarers cargoes and ocean environments for a typical bulk carrier with five cargo holds the normal horizontal sectional loads of torsion induced buckling stresses are usually not very much paik et al 2001 however the instantaneous impact loads at midships where the maximum loads are most likely to occur have been observed to be huge as cargo shifts occurred in the 1st 4th holds of five cargo holds and a violent sloshing coincide this phenomenon has previously been ignored by ship owners and marine designers due largely to its rareness and occasional invisibility however very rapidly developed market demand pushes shipments of the highly viscous nickel ores from less developed countries to highly developed countries lei 2011 in turn increases the importance of torsional moments and horizontal loads horizontal bending moment and horizontal shear force with respect to both ultimate strength and fatigue damage traditional methods are seriously hampered by their poor accuracy in capturing and tracking surface of the highly viscous liquids which tend to deform heavily near the boundaries xue et al 2019 therefore not suitable for predictions and computations of extreme and fatigue loads the numerical analysis has been increasingly important for the accurate computations of the instantaneous impact loads shigunov et al 2015 the aim of this paper is dedicated to the understanding of the instantaneous impact loads when partial cargo shifts and a violent sloshing occur synchronously in oblique waves which are commonly experienced by merchant vessels navigating along the north south oriented coasts in wintertime meanwhile this is also to remind all related parties that an enhancement of the ultimate hull girder strength is necessary to be considered in the future design of the bulk carriers specifically for shipments of the nickel ores 2 data and methods the nickel ore is characterized by its complete liquefaction as vessels with the nickel ore experience oblique waves including beam seas or long time engine or propeller vibrations there are 56 cargoes with similar features to the nickel ore in the list of imo wang et al 2010 the liquefied nickel ore is able to roll with ships together without a cargo shift due mainly to huge viscous shear force triaxial compression tests carried out by some japanese researchers show that shear strength of this nickel ore abruptly decreases when the moisture content exceeds 42 ohta et al 1992 previous study has validated that cargo shifts are apt to occur when the inertial force of the liquefied nickel ore is greater than the shear force as a ship is rolling zou et al 2018 for a typical nickel ore bulk carrier with five cargo holds the oblique wave induced external excitations experienced by each cargo hold may be different usually with the first 3 or 4 cargo holds fore same but the last one or two aft different in turn leading to partial cargo shifts as a collapse of the viscous shear force takes place fig 1 for merchant vessels navigating along the north south oriented coasts in s e asia in wintertime for example along the coasts of china the oblique waves are observed to be dominant although the maximum sloshings for a bulk carrier with liquefied nickel ore can be achieved in beam seas the torsional moments are usually very small in a bit to achieve the intended effects of both the instantaneous impact loads and the torsional moments the oblique waves are considered only in this study the most direct consequences of the partial cargo shifts are the enormous instantaneous impact loads on ship s sidewalls and extreme torsional moments which may cause serious damage to ship s structures and deck fittings traditional methods are difficult in predicting and computing the exceptional loads owing largely to their less accuracy liu et al 2017 here we estimate and calculate the loads using a couple of improved numerical methods for example the governing equations of fluid motions are discretized by improved arbitrary lagrange euler ale method and improved finite volume method the equations of ship motions are solved by integral of newmark method the coupled equations of ship motions and liquefied cargo sloshing are solved using prediction multistep corrections 2 1 governing equations of the liquefied cargo the prescribed ore we attempt to study is the laterite nickel ore which is liable to liquefy completely and become a blended dark red liquid with larger than normal viscosity not like some ores with water seeping out only the liquefied nickel ore in cargo holds is assumed to be incompressible homogenous newtonian fluid with constant density ρ and viscosity μ although absence of breaking and overturning waves for fluids with large viscosity is thought to make the surface capturing and tracking more convenient severe topological deformations of the surface near boundaries and corners are validated difficult in computations rendering the processes of solving coupled equations much more complex in turn lowering the accuracy hong et al 2015 improved numerical methods are considered more suitable in dealing with the complex surface of the fluids with large viscosity comparing with the external excitations in this case the fluid sloshings are thought to be dominant the continuity equation and the transport of fluid momentum equations can be globally expressed as yan et al 2012 jiang et al 2000 1 ρ φ t ρ v φ γ φ φ s φ where φ 1 u v w γ φ 0 u u u s φ 0 p x v x x x v x y y v x z z p y v y x x v y y y v y z z p z v z x x v z y y v z z z v i j μ u j x i represents viscous shear forces for better descriptions of the fluid motions in the irregular areas of the cargo holds for example the areas near boundaries and corners the governing equations in cartesian coordinate system can be transformed into a new form in arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system as follows 2 x x ξ η ζ τ y y ξ η ζ τ z z ξ η ζ τ t τ in an effort to counter the shortcomings of prior methods in poorly capturing and tracking surface of violent sloshing fluids the ale grids are employed the governing equations in arbitrary curvilinear

τ a n d z τ are the velocities of the grids in different directions respectively j j i j and j i j are the coefficients of coordinate transformations in x y and z axes respectively 2 2 discretizations of the equations for the term of time the second order precision backward difference scheme is utilized 4 φ t n 1 3 φ n 1 4 φ n φ n 1 2 δ t for the discretized pressure and momentum equations the improved finite volume method of non staggered grids is employed yan et al 2012 the generalized expression can be described as 5 a p φ φ p i p a i φ φ i s φ φ u v w p the equations of fluid motions are resolved with piso scheme jiang 1996 2 3 equations of ship motions the equations of ship motions in oblique waves can globally be expressed as follows 6 m x c x k x f v p x x a n d x represent the accelerations velocities and column vectors of fluid displacements rolling angle respectively m is the matrices of mass including the mass of flow and additional water mass c is the damping coefficient k is the restoring coefficient f denotes column vectors of fluid loads including the loads induced by the oblique waves and sloshing of the liquefied cargo 2 4 solving coupled equations of fluid and ship motions liquefied cargoes with large viscous coefficients are liable to deform heavily around boundaries and corners breaking and overturning of the sloshing is unlikely in this case and therefore not considered and traditional approaches usually result in huger than normal computations in resolving the coupled equations due to repeated iterations in turn reduce the calculation accuracy of the results here the prediction multistep corrections proposed by other researchers are employed chen et al 1976 details are given as follows prediction step x n 1 0 x n δ t x n 1 2 β δ t

generally r takes 2 3 steps the variations of pressure in time domain can be resolved using the improved finite volume method yan et al 2012 which can apparently suppress the numerical oscillations of diffusive flux near boundaries through reinforcing nonlinear distributions of variables in finite control volume and the prediction multistep corrections chen et al 1976 which is able to automatically identify and correct next potential prediction errors 2 5 torsional moment in still waters the torsional moment is a product of pressure and arm for a rolling vessel however the expression is more complex here the strip theory is employed for computations each torsional moment can be globally expressed as torsional moment t x d 2 θ d t 2 0 x f m i d x θ heeling angle f m i moment function per

shift induced torsional moment t x r ship rolling induced torsional moment t x a additional torsional moment total torsional moment t x s u m is the integral of t x along the length of ship 2 6 model test for further assessments of the numerical simulations a delicate model experiment is conducted in a nearly enclosed ocean basin with external influence almost playing a negligible role the results obtained from the numerical methods are compared with that from the model tests a 1 60 scale model of a deadweight 57000t bulk carrier is used for tests a double flap wave paddle is used to generate regular or irregular waves the nonlinear forces and moments are measured using strain gauges at three sections at l p p 4 l p p 2 and l p p 3 4 from aft perpendicular ap respectively with various amplitudes frequencies and periods at a constant speed of 10 knots the pressure is measured with digital pressure gauges at 3 4 height of cargo depth at portside walls of each cargo hold tables 1 and

used in the experiments 3 results it is assumed that the incident angle of the oblique waves λ 93 m is 60 off the port bow of the aforesaid ship with rectangle rigid tanks the rolling motion is considered dominant whereas other motions are ignored two typical exciting frequencies f 0 139 hz and 0 182 hz respectively experienced mostly by merchant vessels at sea especially along the north south oriented coasts in wintertime but the amplitude varying from case to case are used to examine the response of the pressure on the sidewalls portside only and the torsional moments at different sections as the partial cargo shifts occur in the 1st 3rd and the 1st 4th cargo holds respectively the first case is that the frequency of forced rolling remains constant f 0 139 hz but the amplitude gradually increases at a step of 2 using an electronic angle controller until the partial cargo shifts in the 1st 3rd and the 1st 4th cargo holds respective occur the initial amplitude of ship rolling is set to 5 the second case is that the frequency of forced rolling is replaced by 0 182 hz experienced more commonly by ships with ores due to huge gm values and the amplitude gradually increases at a step of 2 until the partial cargo shifts in the 1st 3rd and the 1st 4th cargo holds respective take place in an attempt to quickly achieve the results in a limited time the cargo condition with moisture content of 37 5 for the sampled nickel ore is chosen the moisture content prescribed in this case is slightly higher than the threshold 35 7 recommended by the international maritime organization s code of safe practice for solid bulk cargoes bc code but is very close to that in the nickel ores carried by the accident vessels the cargo in five cargo holds of the prescribed ship is assumed to be in a state of full liquefaction before simulating 3 1 surface evolutions of sloshing fig 3 shows the simulations of sloshing in the rectangle rigid tanks at different times when the liquid level is around 50 of tank depth observed in the third tank with rolling frequency of 0 139 hz and amplitude 12 the liquid surface evolutions indicate that the liquid sloshing is relatively weak at the beginning of sloshing and the overall liquid level remains basically flat from 0 to 2s as the amplitude heeling angle increases the liquid surface exhibits a wave like sloshing at 3s and 6s sometimes the sloshing becomes violent with sloshing waves breaking and splashing however in this case only wave like sloshing has been observed it is noteworthy that the surface evolutions of sloshing may vary from tank to tank due to different forces acting upon the different sections of the ship fluid sloshing simulations also demonstrate that geometry of a tank rectangle or wedge has little influence on the simulations when fluid level is between 1 4 and 3 4 of tank depth however the influence increases once beyond above ranges 3 2 analysis of instantaneous impact loads for simplicity of calculations it is assumed that all five cargo holds are exactly same rectangle in dimension and configuration the wave direction 120 corresponding to 60 off the port bow of ship is taken into account during the entire experiment fig 4 shows that the pressure on sidewalls increases with a growth of amplitude when the ship is rolling at frequency 0 139hz obviously a collapse of liquid shear force suddenly occurs around 183s in turn a cargo shift in the 1st 3rd holds directly leading to huge instantaneous impact loads which are attained about 83 85 kpa almost 8 times of the normal load 10 kpa comparing with the model tests a conclusion can be drawn that the results obtained from the numerical methods are in well agreement with that from the model tests in all frequencies as the amplitude is relatively smaller but the deviations increase with a growing amplitude further simulations are performed in evaluating the torsional moment at three specific locations the results indicate that the largest instantaneous torsional moment is attained about 10 10 5 knm at midships lpp 2 from ap if the cargo shift takes place in the 1st 3rd holds fig 5 b with the foremost section 3lpp 4 from ap having the smallest torsional moment fig 5c consistent with the previous study hong et al 2008 model experiments illustrate that the simulated results are well in line with that from the model tests as the amplitude is not very big however the peaks tend to split when the amplitude is relatively large in the model experiments most likely associating with the features of the nickel ores nevertheless this phenomenon has never been observed in the numerical simulations we run the numerical model by repeating above procedures but with a cargo shift in the 1st 4th holds which is specifically designed by controlling the forces acting upon the different sections of the ship under the same frequency the results demonstrate that the maximum pressure on the sidewalls rapidly increases reaching 92 95 kpa as the partial cargo shifts occur in the 1st 4th holds obviously bigger than that observed in the 1st 3rd hold cargo shifts the model test results are basically in conformity of that acquired from the numerical simulations however the model tests exhibit a more rapid collapse of the shear force than predicted fig 6 the torsional moments increase in almost all monitoring locations as the cargo shifts occur in the 1st 4th holds fig 7 a c the pronounced increase is observed at section lpp 4 rather than lpp 2 from ap it is noted that the maximum torsional moment 9 8 10 5 knm also takes place at the same section fig 7a although the section 3lpp 4 is not where the maximum torsional moment occurs its growth by about 0 9 1 10 5 knm of the torsional moment is evident fig 7c these results have been confirmed by the model experiments an attempt in applying a new exciting frequency of 0 182hz possibly experienced more commonly by bulk carriers with ores sailing along the north south oriented coasts is executed to test the response of the pressure on the sidewalls the numerical simulations confirm that the maximum instantaneous impact loads remain growing attaining 106 kpa fig 8 implying that the exciting frequency has unnegligible influence on the impact loads the numerical simulations agree well with the model tests the peak torsional moment at section lpp 4 increases by about 0 6 10 5 knm comparing with the same cargo shift condition in the 1st 3rd holds but different frequencies with a more violent rolling reaching 8 6 10 5 knm fig 9 a however the maximum torsional moment is observed at midships lpp 2 from ap attaining about 9 8 10 5 knm fig 9b despite being the smallest the maximum torsional moment in section 3lpp 4 from ap is comparable to that in the section lpp 4 fig 9c if the partial cargo shifts occur in the 1st 4th holds under the same exciting rolling frequency of 0 182hz the numerical simulations indicate that the instantaneous impact loads hit a ceiling reaching an unprecedented 118 kpa nearly 12 folds of the normal load 10 kpa fig 10 the model experiments demonstrate that the results obtained from the numerical simulations are principally in phase with that from the model tests manifesting that the numerical method used in this case is suitable to capture and track the complex surface of fluid sloshing with large topological deformations the torsional moments in all three sections are found to be considerably bigger under the prescribed worst conditions of cargo shifts in the 1st 4th hold and larger exciting rolling frequency fig 11 a c the section lpp 4 from ap has the largest torsional moment 11 10 5 knm fig 11a almost 5 6 times of the normal condition with the section 3lpp 4 possessing the smallest 9 8 10 5 knm fig 11c the numerical simulations also indicate that although the torsional moment in section 3lpp 4 is always the smallest among the three monitoring locations it exhibits more nonlinear consistent with the previous study shigunov et al 2015 the model simulations also show that the response is still within the linear range as the heeling angle is relatively small 8 but is over the non linear range as the heeling angle becomes large 10 fig 12 from above simulations and model experiments a simple conclusion can be drawn that the numerical simulation always agrees better with the experimental troughs rather than crests in both pressure and torsional moments torsional moment distributions along longitude presented in figs 13 and 14 are in a non dimensionalised form with respect to sea water density 1 025 gravity acceleration g length between perpendiculars l p p waterline breadth b w l and amplitude a figs 13 and 14 also offer comparisons of the longitudinal distributions of the torsional moments the results acquired from different frequencies are presented separately the peaks numerically simulated are at midships when cargo shifts occur in the 1st 3rd cargo holds only nevertheless the peaks measured in the ocean basin are not exactly located at midships but slightly aft for about 10m regardless of the rolling frequency figs 13a 14a this discrepancy is possibly ascribed to inhomogeneous sizes and irregular shapes of the cargo holds because the first and the last cargo holds usually with irregular shapes particularly near the bottom and fore and aft ends are normally smaller than the others in dimension as the cargo shifts take place in the 1st 4th cargo holds the maximum torsional moments obtained in both numerical methods and model tests are obviously located aft midships the numerical simulations show that the maximum torsional moment is at l p p 4 from ap rather than at midships however the results from the model experiments are more close to midships at about 0 3 0 35 l p p from ap figs 13b and 14b 4 conclusions considerable casualties of bulk carriers with nickel ores increase the importance of the torsional moments and horizontal loads with respect to both ultimate strength and fatigue damage traditional methods are difficult in capturing and tracking the complex surface of the fluid sloshing usually with large topological deformations therefore not applicable in predicting and calculating those exceptional instantaneous impact loads improved numerical methods are considered to be able to solve a series of formidable issues arising from the capturing and tracking of the fluid surface and the discretizations of the equations with sufficient accuracy the numerical simulations and model tests both illustrate that the instantaneous impact loads can be huge far beyond that previously expected when bulk carriers with nickel ores experience a violent rolling in oblique waves in turn a partial cargo shift in the 1st 3rd or the 1st 4th cargo holds for a typical bulk carrier with 5 holds specifically sailing along the north south oriented coasts in wintertime the largest torsional moment subsequently validated by the model experiments is observed exactly at neither l p p 4 from ap nor midships but at 0 3 0 35 l p p as the cargo shifts occur in the 1st 4th holds in wave direction 120 regardless of rolling frequency contrast to the previous studies oka et al 2009 the results obtained from the numerical simulations compare satisfactory with the model experiments the discrepancy between them is very small in a relative smaller amplitude and grows with an increase of the amplitude but is still in an acceptable scope over the entire processes suggestions for improving torsional strength bulk carriers specifically designed for carrying ores usually have large gm values a violent sloshing and strong torsion are most likely to occur if vessels experience unusual oblique waves leading to a liquefaction of the ores in turn a possible cargo shift partial cargo shifts induced by oblique waves superimposed on a violent rolling would not only produce extraordinary instantaneous impact loads but also cause severe damage to ship s structures navigational instruments and deck fittings such as hatch coaming deformations precise navigational instrument malfunctions and disorders of ship s cranes etc despite not being likely to result in a catastrophic consequence of ship capsizing and sinking in an effort to counter those possible unusual impact loads for bulk carriers with similar dimensions and structures to the prescribed ship a few suggestions are proposed as follows based on our calculations 1 the longitudinal bone of the anti torsion platform should be enhanced and traditional angle steel is thought to be insufficient 2 thickness of hatch coaming should be properly increased based on the regions the prescribed ships are scheduled to navigate in the future 3 thickness of angle steel for stiffeners in all parts is proposed to grow substantially in order to stand the deformations of the hatch coamings 4 the traditional deck plate is considered too weak to counter the exceptional warping stresses and buckling stresses and a reasonable increase is essential although the growth of steel plate s thickness tends to result in an increase of the steel quantity of the whole ship the overall influence can be minimized in a controllable level on the other hand concentrated stresses at some special locations e g at hatch coamings and corners of cargo holds owing to torsional distortions are critical for fatigue strength and must be taken into account by owners and marine engineers in the future structural designs human factors responsible for marine accidents improving torsional strength is absolutely important but is far insufficient to shield the bulk carriers from marine accident human factors are considered non negligible these primarily include the following 1 inadequate special training specific training plays a critical role in preventing the marine accidents from happening nevertheless in many training agencies in some developing countries such as philippines indonesia india etc special training for correctly operating vessels with the nickel ores is seriously inadequate 2 lack of carrying nickel ore related textbooks although bulk carriers are not special vessels the cargoes carried by those bulk carriers are somewhat special and experienced seafarers are needed to my best knowledge lack of carrying nickel ore related textbooks widely exists worldwide it is time to remind imo to put it on the agenda 3 masters poor skills a number of ship masters who are engaging in the shipments of the nickel ores have not yet received normal and sufficient education with poor seamanship usually leading to incorrect operations 4 lack of sense of responsibility some mariners are found to be irresponsible for routine watch with neither calling ship masters nor taking proper measures as vessels experience unusual waves sometimes resulting in quick marine accidents particularly at nighttime by and large safety and efficiency constitute the fundamental stone of world shipping industry we should improve marine shipping environment not only in hardware but also in software credit authorship

rendering the processes of solving coupled equations much more complex in turn lowering the accuracy hong et al 2015 improved numerical methods are considered more suitable in dealing with the complex surface of the fluids with large viscosity comparing with the external excitations in this case the fluid sloshings are thought to be dominant the continuity equation and the transport of fluid momentum equations can be globally expressed as yan et al 2012 jiang et al 2000 1 ρ φ t ρ v φ γ φ φ s φ where φ 1 u v w γ φ 0 u u u s φ 0 p x v x x x v x y y v x z z p y v y x x v y y y v y z z p z v

effort to counter the shortcomings of prior methods in poorly capturing and tracking surface of violent sloshing fluids the ale grids are employed the governing equations in arbitrary curvilinear

of the equations for the term of time the second order precision backward difference scheme is utilized 4 φ t n 1 3 φ n 1 4 φ n φ n 1 2 δ t for the discretized pressure and momentum equations the improved finite volume method of non staggered grids is employed yan et al 2012 the generalized expression can be described as 5 a p φ φ p i p a i φ φ i s φ φ u v w p the equations of fluid motions are resolved with piso scheme jiang 1996 2 3 equations of ship motions the equations of ship motions in oblique waves can globally be expressed as follows 6 m x c x k x f v p x x a n d x represent the accelerations velocities and column vectors of fluid displacements rolling angle respectively m is the matrices of mass including the mass of flow and additional water mass c is the damping coefficient k is the restoring coefficient f denotes column vectors of fluid loads including the loads induced by the oblique waves and sloshing of the liquefied cargo 2 4 solving coupled equations of fluid and ship motions liquefied cargoes with large viscous coefficients are liable to deform heavily around boundaries and corners breaking and overturning of the sloshing is unlikely in this case and therefore not considered and traditional approaches usually result in huger than normal computations in resolving the coupled equations due to repeated iterations in turn reduce the calculation

generally r takes 2 3 steps the variations of pressure in time domain can be resolved using the improved finite volume method yan et al 2012 which can apparently suppress the numerical oscillations of diffusive flux near boundaries through reinforcing nonlinear distributions of variables in finite control volume and the prediction multistep corrections chen et al 1976 which is able to automatically identify and correct next potential prediction errors 2 5 torsional moment in still waters the torsional moment is a product of pressure and arm for a rolling vessel however the expression is more

test for further assessments of the numerical simulations a delicate model experiment is conducted in a nearly enclosed ocean basin with external influence almost playing a negligible role the results obtained from the numerical methods are compared with that from the model tests a 1 60 scale model of a deadweight 57000t bulk carrier is used for tests a double flap wave paddle is used to generate regular or irregular waves the nonlinear forces and moments are measured using strain gauges at three sections at l p p 4 l p p 2 and l p p 3 4 from aft perpendicular ap respectively with various amplitudes frequencies and periods at a constant speed of 10 knots the pressure is measured with digital pressure gauges at 3 4 height of cargo depth at portside walls of each cargo hold tables 1 and

used in the experiments 3 results it is assumed that the incident angle of the oblique waves λ 93 m is 60 off the port bow of the aforesaid ship with rectangle rigid tanks the rolling motion is considered dominant whereas other motions are ignored two typical exciting frequencies f 0 139 hz and 0 182 hz respectively experienced mostly by merchant vessels at sea especially along the north south oriented coasts in wintertime but the amplitude varying from case to case are used to examine the response of the pressure on the sidewalls portside only and the torsional moments at different sections as the partial cargo shifts occur in the 1st 3rd and the 1st 4th cargo holds respectively the first case is that the frequency of forced rolling remains constant f 0 139 hz but the amplitude gradually increases at a step of 2 using an electronic angle controller until the partial cargo shifts in the 1st 3rd and the 1st 4th cargo holds respective occur the initial amplitude of ship rolling is set to 5 the second case is that the frequency of forced rolling is replaced by 0 182 hz experienced more commonly by ships with ores due to huge gm values and the amplitude gradually increases at a step of 2 until the partial cargo shifts in the 1st 3rd and the 1st 4th cargo holds respective take place in an attempt to quickly achieve the results in a limited time the cargo condition with moisture content of 37 5 for the sampled nickel ore is chosen the moisture content prescribed in this case is slightly higher than the threshold 35 7 recommended by the international maritime organization s code of safe practice for solid bulk cargoes bc code but is very close to that in the nickel ores carried by the accident vessels the cargo in five cargo holds of the prescribed ship is assumed to be in a state of full liquefaction before simulating 3 1 surface evolutions of sloshing fig 3 shows the simulations of sloshing in the rectangle rigid tanks at different times when the liquid level is around 50 of tank depth observed in the third tank with rolling frequency of 0 139 hz and amplitude 12 the liquid surface evolutions indicate that the liquid sloshing is relatively weak at the beginning of sloshing and the overall liquid level remains basically flat from 0 to 2s as the amplitude heeling angle increases the liquid surface exhibits a wave like sloshing at 3s and 6s sometimes the sloshing becomes violent with sloshing waves breaking and splashing however in this case only wave like sloshing has been observed it is noteworthy that the surface evolutions of sloshing may vary from tank to tank due to different forces acting upon the different sections of the ship fluid sloshing simulations also demonstrate that geometry of a tank rectangle or wedge has little influence on the simulations when fluid level is between 1 4 and 3 4 of tank depth however the influence increases once beyond above ranges 3 2 analysis of instantaneous impact loads for simplicity of calculations it is assumed that all five cargo holds are exactly same rectangle in dimension and configuration the wave direction 120 corresponding to 60 off the port bow of ship is taken into account during the entire experiment fig 4 shows that the pressure on sidewalls increases with a growth of amplitude when the ship is rolling at frequency 0 139hz obviously a collapse of liquid shear force suddenly occurs around 183s in turn a cargo shift in the 1st 3rd holds directly leading to huge instantaneous impact loads which are attained about 83 85 kpa almost 8 times of the normal load 10 kpa comparing with the model tests a conclusion can be drawn that the results obtained from the numerical methods are in well agreement with that from the model tests in all frequencies as the amplitude is relatively smaller but the deviations increase with a growing amplitude further simulations are performed in evaluating the torsional moment at three specific locations the results indicate that the largest instantaneous torsional moment is attained about 10 10 5 knm at midships lpp 2 from ap if the cargo shift takes place in the 1st 3rd holds fig 5 b with the foremost section 3lpp 4 from ap having the smallest torsional moment fig 5c consistent with the previous study hong et al 2008 model experiments illustrate that the simulated results are well in line with that from the model tests as the amplitude is not very big however the peaks tend to split when the amplitude is relatively large in the model experiments most likely associating with the features of the nickel ores nevertheless this phenomenon has never been observed in the numerical simulations we run the numerical model by repeating above procedures but with a cargo shift in the 1st 4th holds which is specifically designed by controlling the forces acting upon the different sections of the ship under the same frequency the results demonstrate that the maximum pressure on the sidewalls rapidly increases reaching 92 95 kpa as the partial cargo shifts occur in the 1st 4th holds obviously bigger than that observed in the 1st 3rd hold cargo shifts the model test results are basically in conformity of that acquired from the numerical simulations however the model tests exhibit a more rapid collapse of the shear force than predicted fig 6 the torsional moments increase in almost all monitoring locations as the cargo shifts occur in the 1st 4th holds fig 7 a c the pronounced increase is observed at section lpp 4 rather than lpp 2 from ap it is noted that the maximum torsional moment 9 8 10 5 knm also takes place at the same section fig 7a although the section 3lpp 4 is not where the maximum torsional moment occurs its growth by about 0 9 1 10 5 knm of the torsional moment is evident fig 7c these results have been confirmed by the model experiments an attempt in applying a new exciting frequency of 0 182hz possibly experienced more commonly by bulk carriers with ores sailing along the north south oriented coasts is executed to test the response of the pressure on the sidewalls the numerical simulations confirm that the maximum instantaneous impact loads remain growing attaining 106 kpa fig 8 implying that the exciting frequency has unnegligible influence on the impact loads the numerical simulations agree well with the model tests the peak torsional moment at section lpp 4 increases by about 0 6 10 5 knm comparing with the same cargo shift condition in the 1st 3rd holds but different frequencies with a more violent rolling reaching 8 6 10 5 knm fig 9 a however the maximum torsional moment is observed at midships lpp 2 from ap attaining about 9 8 10 5 knm fig 9b despite being the smallest the maximum torsional moment in section 3lpp 4 from ap is comparable to that in the section lpp 4 fig 9c if the partial cargo shifts occur in the 1st 4th holds under the same exciting rolling frequency of 0 182hz the numerical simulations indicate that the instantaneous impact loads hit a ceiling reaching an unprecedented 118 kpa nearly 12 folds of the normal load 10 kpa fig 10 the model experiments demonstrate that the results obtained from the numerical simulations are principally in phase with that from the model tests manifesting that the numerical method used in this case is suitable to capture and track the complex surface of fluid sloshing with large topological deformations the torsional moments in all three sections are found to be considerably bigger under the prescribed worst conditions of cargo shifts in the 1st 4th hold and larger exciting rolling frequency fig 11 a c the section lpp 4 from ap has the largest torsional moment 11 10 5 knm fig 11a almost 5 6 times of the normal condition with the section 3lpp 4 possessing the smallest 9 8 10 5 knm fig 11c the numerical simulations also indicate that although the torsional moment in section 3lpp 4 is always the smallest among the three monitoring locations it exhibits more nonlinear consistent with the previous study shigunov et al 2015 the model simulations also show that the response is still within the linear range as the heeling angle is relatively small 8 but is over the non linear range as the heeling angle becomes large 10 fig 12 from above simulations and model experiments a simple conclusion can be drawn that the numerical simulation always agrees better with the experimental troughs rather than crests in both pressure and torsional moments torsional moment distributions along longitude presented in figs 13 and 14 are in a non dimensionalised form with respect to sea water density 1 025 gravity acceleration g length between perpendiculars l p p waterline breadth b w l and amplitude a figs 13 and 14 also offer comparisons of the longitudinal distributions of the torsional moments the results acquired from different frequencies are presented separately the peaks numerically simulated are at midships when cargo shifts occur in the 1st 3rd cargo holds only nevertheless the peaks measured in the ocean basin are not exactly located at midships but slightly aft for about 10m regardless of the rolling frequency figs 13a 14a this discrepancy is possibly ascribed to inhomogeneous sizes and irregular shapes of the cargo holds because the first and the last cargo holds usually with irregular shapes particularly near the bottom and fore and aft ends are normally smaller than the others in dimension as the cargo shifts take place in the 1st 4th cargo holds the maximum torsional moments obtained in both numerical methods and model tests are obviously located aft midships the numerical simulations show that the maximum torsional moment is at l p p 4 from ap rather than at midships however the results from the model experiments are more close to midships at about 0 3 0 35 l p p from ap figs 13b and 14b 4 conclusions considerable casualties of bulk carriers with nickel ores increase the importance of the torsional moments and horizontal loads with respect to both ultimate strength and fatigue damage traditional methods are difficult in capturing and tracking the complex surface of the fluid sloshing usually with large topological deformations therefore not applicable in predicting and calculating those exceptional instantaneous impact loads improved numerical methods are considered to be able to solve a series of formidable issues arising from the capturing and tracking of the fluid surface and the discretizations of the equations with sufficient accuracy the numerical simulations and model tests both illustrate that the instantaneous impact loads can be huge far beyond that previously expected when bulk carriers with nickel ores experience a violent rolling in oblique waves in turn a partial cargo shift in the 1st 3rd or the 1st 4th cargo holds for a typical bulk carrier with 5 holds specifically sailing along the north south oriented coasts in wintertime the largest torsional moment subsequently validated by the model experiments is observed exactly at neither l p p 4 from ap nor midships but at 0 3 0 35 l p p as the cargo shifts occur in the 1st 4th holds in wave direction 120 regardless of rolling frequency contrast to the previous studies oka et al 2009 the results obtained from the numerical simulations compare satisfactory with the model experiments the discrepancy between them is very small in a relative smaller amplitude and grows with an increase of the amplitude but is still in an acceptable scope over the entire processes suggestions for improving torsional strength bulk carriers specifically designed for carrying ores usually have large gm values a violent sloshing and strong torsion are most likely to occur if vessels experience unusual oblique waves leading to a liquefaction of the ores in turn a possible cargo shift partial cargo shifts induced by oblique waves superimposed on a violent rolling would not only produce extraordinary instantaneous impact loads but also cause severe damage to ship s structures navigational instruments and deck fittings such as hatch coaming deformations precise navigational instrument malfunctions and disorders of ship s cranes etc despite not being likely to result in a catastrophic consequence of ship capsizing and sinking in an effort to counter those possible unusual impact loads for bulk carriers with similar dimensions and structures to the prescribed ship a few suggestions are proposed as follows based on our calculations 1 the longitudinal bone of the anti torsion platform should be enhanced and traditional angle steel is thought to be insufficient 2 thickness of hatch coaming should be properly increased based on the regions the prescribed ships are scheduled to navigate in the future 3 thickness of angle steel for stiffeners in all parts is proposed to grow substantially in order to stand the deformations of the hatch coamings 4 the traditional deck plate is considered too weak to counter the exceptional warping stresses and buckling stresses and a reasonable increase is essential although the growth of steel plate s thickness tends to result in an increase of the steel quantity of the whole ship the overall influence can be minimized in a controllable level on the other hand concentrated stresses at some special locations e g at hatch coamings and corners of cargo holds owing to torsional distortions are critical for fatigue strength and must be taken into account by owners and marine engineers in the future structural designs human factors responsible for marine accidents improving torsional strength is absolutely important but is far insufficient to shield the bulk carriers from marine accident human factors are considered non negligible these primarily include the following 1 inadequate special training specific training plays a critical role in preventing the marine accidents from happening nevertheless in many training agencies in some developing countries such as philippines indonesia india etc special training for correctly operating vessels with the nickel ores is seriously inadequate 2 lack of carrying nickel ore related textbooks although bulk carriers are not special vessels the cargoes carried by those bulk carriers are somewhat special and experienced seafarers are needed to my best knowledge lack of carrying nickel ore related textbooks widely exists worldwide it is time to remind imo to put it on the agenda 3 masters poor skills a number of ship masters who are engaging in the shipments of the nickel ores have not yet received normal and sufficient education with poor seamanship usually leading to incorrect operations 4 lack of sense of responsibility some mariners are found to be irresponsible for routine watch with neither calling ship masters nor taking proper measures as vessels experience unusual waves sometimes resulting in quick marine accidents particularly at nighttime by and large safety and efficiency constitute the fundamental stone of world shipping industry we should improve marine shipping environment not only in hardware but also in software credit authorship

20631,in this work the hydrodynamic performance of a scaled bottom trawl model in current was investigated by using numerical simulations based on the fluid structure interaction fsi method in two way coupling and the flume tank test based on modified tauti s law in this numerical model a finite volume approach was used for solving the navier stokes equations combined with a k ω shear stress turbulent sst model for describing the flow a finite element approach was used for solving the large deformation nonlinear structural dynamic equation to describe the trawl net configuration and the nodal displacement a series of flume tank tests was conducted on three scaled bottom trawl models with different twine diameters twine materials and mesh sizes in addition three dimensional 3d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv measurements were performed to experimentally investigate the effect of turbulent flow on the bottom trawl net performance the comparisons showed that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental data both the numerical and experimental results indicated that the increase in mesh size using dyneema multifilament and the decrease in twine diameter using nylon monofilament led to decrease in the drag force by about 2 1 times and 2 2 times respectively p 0 002 ancova test it was found that there was spatial development of turbulent boundary layer flow around the trawl net and the vortex shedding in the trawl wake in addition the equivalent stress elastic strain and total deformation increased with the increase in flow velocity and mesh size and the decrease in twine diameter keywords bottom trawl k ω shear stress turbulent sst model acoustic doppler velocimeter large deformation non linear structural finite element model velocity reduction hydrodynamic forces 1 introduction efficient bottom trawl nets are essential for the coastal fishing industry rising fuel prices and declining fish stocks have an enormous impact on the entire coastal fishing industry since fuel cost and catchability are the major components of the operation cost and ecosystem impact respectively the reasons for this are the high drag low sweep area and nonselective nature of the bottom trawl net therefore optimum structural design of the bottom trawl is necessary to reduce the fuel consumption increase the swept area reduce the by catch and improve the efficiency mchugh et al 2016 marlen et al 2014 to improve profitability and ensure sustainability of the resources many researchers have worked and continue to find ways to make bottom trawls more efficient and selective the dynamic behavior of a bottom trawl is largely affected by its shape design construction rigging as well as the hydrodynamic forces experienced while towing along the seabed kim et al 2007 khaled et al 2012 nguyen 2016 during the trawling process the trawl mesh is deformed by the impact of water flow and the distribution of the surrounding flow field changes considerably this change in the flow field further affects the hydrodynamic force of the mesh chen and yao 2019 understanding the dynamic behavior and performance of these structures prior to expensive sea trials is a key step in the fishing gear development cycle winger et al 2006 nguyen et al 2015 in particular numerical simulation is becoming one of the popular methods for evaluating trawl designs and assessing their performance during the early stages of gear development nguyen 2016 the dynamic behavior and performance of bottom trawls have been studied for several decades using various theoretical and experimental methods tauti 1934 dickson 1961 fridman 1973 fiorentini et al 2004 historically these experiments were carried out using engineering models in flume tanks or full scale prototypes at sea however during the last two decades numerical simulation has emerged as a new and powerful tool for understanding the dynamic behavior of trawl net systems based on hydrodynamic theory and principles a fishing gear system can now be mathematically modelled the numerical model allows the prediction of its dynamic performance under the influence of various forces in the aquatic environment external forces such as drag force shearing force sinking force and buoyancy and the properties of the materials used elasticity and stiffness of twines numerical modeling of fishing gear systems has improved substantially in recent years with major advancements in mathematical theory numerical simulation methods and computational fluid dynamics method bessonneau and marichal 1998 takagi et al 2002 lee et al 2011 sun et al 2011 khaled et al 2012 chen et al 2014 li et al 2015 yao et al 2016a tang et al 2017 today many gear designers researchers and manufacturers prefer to begin with numerical simulation of initial conceptual ideas followed by an experimental flume tank winger et al 2006 eventually full scale prototypes are constructed and evaluated under real fishing conditions for their mechanical performance and catchability although numerical simulation and flume tank experiments have their respective advantages and limitations they have been proven to be complementary tools for predicting the performance of full scale fishing gear patursson et al 2010 queirolo et al 2009 nguyen 2016 several studies have been conducted to investigate the engineering performance of the fishing gear system ward et al 2005 and kim et al 2007 conducted an experimental study related to the impact of reduction of twine diameter and increase in mesh sizes on the fuel consumption in trawling they observed a significant decrease in fuel consumption with the decrease in twine diameter and increase in mesh size priour 2005 developed a finite element method for simulating flexible structures made of nettings cables and bars such as fishing gear and fish farming cage which focused on a specific triangular element devoted to net modeling mulvany et al 2004 estimated the hydrodynamic forces on trawl doors using computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis by solving the navier stokes equations with a finite element method pichot 2007 developed a simulation of the flow around and inside a rigid axisymmetric net kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 proposed and discussed a screen type force model for the viscous hydrodynamic load on nets assuming that the net is divided into several flat net panels bouhoubeiny 2012 studied the characteristics of flow governing the hydrodynamic behavior of bottom trawls balash 2012 developed a novel experimental technique to quantify the flexural rigidity of nets zhao et al 2013a 2013b proposed a numerical model based on a porous media fluid model and simulated the flow fields around tandem net cages cornejo et al 2014 numerically studied the flow velocity distribution downstream from a salmon farm in the semidiurnal current chen and christensen 2016 developed a numerical model based on openfoam to study steady current flow through planar net panels and circular fish cages yao et al 2016a 2016b proposed a novel hybrid volume method to analyze the interaction between the net mesh and the surrounding flow field which was used to calculate the interaction between the fluid and net cage under large deformation conditions tang et al 2017 also developed a numerical model to analyze the flow field through the trawl by proposing the deformation of the trawl using fluid structure interaction one way coupling the numerical approach involved combining the k ω shear stress turbulent sst model with the high strain nonlinear finite element method to simulate the interaction between the flow and the trawl with unidirectional coupling techniques chen and yao 2019 also adopted the hybrid volume method to describe fluid trawl interaction first they modelled the trawl net and the flow field based on the lumped mass method and finite volume method separately then they adopted a hybrid volume method hvm to model the fluid structure interaction between the net and surrounding water although chen and christensen 2017 used two way coupling method to simulate the dynamic deformation of the structure and the velocity reduction of the fluid they focused on fish cage however the effect of flow on trawl net structure and the influence of trawl net structure deformation on flow field have both been ignored in the previous studies it is still necessary to analyze the effects of the trawl net deformation twine diameter mesh size and twine diameter on the drag force and the flow field inside and around the trawl net thus the fluid structure interaction fsi two way coupling is necessary to better understand trawl net system performance this study aimed to perform fsi simulation for investigating the influences of twine diameter twine material and mesh size on the hydrodynamic performance of bottom trawl net and to analyze the flow field inside and around it with two way coupling and experimental flume tank a numerical model was constructed based on the two way coupling technique by combining the k ω sst model and the large deformation nonlinear structural finite element model the results were validated with the data obtained by flume tank experiment furthermore the flow field profile obtained in the numerical simulation was analyzed and compared with acoustic doppler velocimetry measurements adv data the comparison between the results of the proposed model and the experimental results showed a difference of 3 therefore it is necessary to consider the coupling effect of the trawl structure deformation and flow field in two way coupling in the modeling of trawl net the findings are expected to contribute to the improvement of coastal bottom trawl net performance 2 materials and methods numerical simulation was performed for analyzing the effect of flow field and structural deformation on the bottom trawl performance and the results were compared with those obtained experimentally in the flume tank the main concept of the numerical approach involved combining cfd method and the large deformation nonlinear finite element method to simulate the interaction between flow and trawl with two way coupling techniques a finite volume approach was used for solving the navier stokes equations combined with a k ω sst model to describe the flow field and capture the turbulence formation around the trawl net moreover the large deformation nonlinear structural model was applied to describe the trawl net structure configuration and to capture the node displacement and trawl deformation this numerical model was successfully performed using ansys workbench software fluent solver and transient structural mechanical solver the numerical simulations were performed using a computer with intel xeon cpu e5 2690 v2 3 0 ghz 2 64 core processors 64 gb ram and 2 tb ssd disk for data writing a more detailed description of the numerical model is given below 2 1 model trawl nets configuration the trawl net models used in this study were 1 18 scale models of a coastal bottom trawl net commonly used by both japanese and korean coastal bottom trawlers as shown in fig 1 overall three trawl net models were built with different twine materials polyethylene dyneema and nylon monofilament mesh sizes and twine diameters table 1 each net had different mesh numbers and twine areas table 2 all three models had the same total stretched length 2 59 m same headline length 2 10 m same footrope length 2 674 m and bridle length of 2 5 m this study evaluated the effects of varying the twine diameter mesh size and twine material on the hydrodynamic drag force and the deformation of bottom trawl net thus trawl net models 2 and 3 were constructed from trawl net 1 by changing the material mesh size and twine diameter on the first belly the square part and the wing end the mesh size of trawl net 2 was 33 5 larger than that of trawls 1 and 3 with a twine diameter about 14 75 lower than that of trawl 1 the twine diameter of trawl net 3 was 61 21 times smaller than that of trawl nets 1 and 2 with the mesh size 3 37 greater than that of trawl net 1 2 2 experiment process experiments for the hydrodynamic forces and flow field measurements around the trawl net were performed in a flume tank at tokyo university of marine sciences and technology tumst to validate the numerical results the test section of the flume tank was 9 m long 2 2 m wide and 1 6 m deep the scaling of physical models was based on the modified tauti s law proposed by hu et al 2001 the basic setup of the flume model test is shown in fig 2 for controlled trawl drag measurements in the flume tank the bridles of trawl nets were attached to two vertical bars and the flow meter was fixed on the bars fig 2 each trawl net model connection point contained a load cell which allowed measurement of the frame line tension at all connection points for each case these two bars also ensured the horizontal opening of trawl model fig 2 the hydrodynamic forces of the three model trawl nets were measured at flow velocities of 0 57 m s 0 68 m s 0 8 m s 0 91 m s and 1 02 m s and at door spread values of 1 6 m 1 8 m and 2 0 m respectively the tensions of the towing point were measured with two load cells of 196 14 n capacity each the load cells were calibrated and zeroed at both the beginning and end of testing the total trawl drag force for a given model at certain flow velocity was calculated from the sum of the two bridle tension measurements multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the bridle and flow direction estimated at 23 41 in this study to study the turbulent flow developing inside and around a bottom trawl net the three dimensional acoustic doppler velocimeter adv system was used to determine u v and w velocity components along the x y and z directions respectively the adv manufactured by nortek with a specified accuracy of 1 mm s was introduced in the water during the experiment to measure the flow velocity at different points inside and around trawl net figs 2 and 3 a steel frame was used to keep the vector device in the orthogonal position and to protect the device sensor from obstacles fig 3 at each measurement point velocity data was sampled for a duration of 20 s at a sampling rate of 20 hz thus the three components of velocity data were assessed every 20 s in order to gain an understanding of the flow characteristics of the flume tank and the nature of the flow to give better confidence in the results of flow measurements inside and around the trawl the experimental data of flow measurement without the presence of fishing gear done by hu et al 2004 was used and analyzed this analysis showed that when the flow velocity through the flume tank was varied from 0 1 to 2 0 m s the turbulence level varied between 2 and 20 and the acceleration flow varied between 1 0 and 5 0 cm s 2 the reciprocating oscillation flow of velocity amplitude was 0 5 m s the measurements of velocity distribution on the working section including near surface and bottom showed that the deviation of velocity obtained in each measurement point was within 2 0 of the mean velocity and within 1 0 on the near center part steady wave height and water level fluctuation on free surface were no more than 1 5 mm and 2 0 mm with flow velocity of 1 5 m s respectively the model trawl net located at the bottom of the flume tank was free to move in the water flow fig 3 for such a configuration the conveyor belt was synchronized with the flow velocity the measurements of velocity fields were performed with two different fixed input streamwise velocities of 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s and the results were compared with those obtained by numerical simulation the instantaneous velocity field measurements were performed on eleven adv planes represented by the red lines in fig 4 which corresponded to the low and high positions of the bottom trawl net structure the velocity measurement was performed on each redline plane and the distance between two planes was 25 cm along the flow direction figs 2 and 4 in vertical direction the distance between two measurement points in the same redline was 10 cm and the maximum depth of experimental velocity field measurement was 40 cm figs 2 and 4 the corresponding reynolds number based on the diamond shaped meshes and the upstream velocity v is given by 1 re v l ν where v is flow velocity ν is kinematic viscosity and l is mesh size thus the studied reynolds numbers are 7463 31 and 8872 32 at flow velocities of 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s respectively 2 3 numerical modeling setup to reduce the boundary effect of the numerical flume tank and to avoid the iteration divergence of numerical modelling fluent solver the numerical water tank dimensions adopted to calculate the hydrodynamic forces acting on trawl net were 9 0 m 2 2 m x 1 6 m length x width x depth fig 5 the different trawl nets and nettings used in the numerical simulation were a series of separate cylinders connected together the flow velocities applied in the numerical simulation were the same as those used in the flume tank experiment 2 4 fluid flow model in this study the flow was considered as a viscous three dimensional unsteady boundary layer turbulent flow a cfd based scheme was used to solve the interaction between the flow and the trawl net in numerical water tank the governing equations of the flow model were solved using the finite volume method together with the k ω sst model the motion of the three dimensional incompressible flow is described by the system of reynold averaged navier stokes rans equations with reynold stress approximated by eddy viscosity model the continuity and momentum equations are given as follows ferziger and peric 2002 2 ρ t ρ u 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i ρ g i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s i where t is time μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity g i is the gravitational force ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress ρ is the fluid density u i represents the velocity components x i represents the spatial coordinates u i is the fluctuation velocity s i is a source term for the momentum equation which describes the water resistance force acting on trawl net and i j 1 2 3 x y z p is the transient pressure which is determined by the following equation 4 p t p t 2 3 ρ k where p is the time average pressure and k is the turbulent kinetic energy in the present numerical simulation the sst turbulence model menter 1994 is added to eqs 2 and 3 to model the reynolds stresses the sst k ω turbulence model is a two equation eddy viscosity model combining the original k ϵ and wilcox k ω models menter 1994 the use of k ω formulation in the inner parts of the boundary layer makes the model directly useable all the way down to the wall through the viscous sub layer hence the sst k ω model can be used as a low reynolds turbulence model without any extra damping functions the sst formulation also switches to a k ϵ behavior in the free stream and thereby avoids the common k ω problem of high sensitivity of the model to the inlet stream turbulence properties another advantage this model is its good behavior in adverse pressure gradients and separating flow in addition this model produces slightly high turbulence levels in regions with large normal strain such as stagnation regions and regions with strong acceleration thus as the reynolds number in this study is lower and due to all the above mentioned advantages this model is appropriate for the simulation of the flow field around the trawl net the k ω sst turbulent model is governed by 5 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k β ρ ω k x j μ σ k μ t k x j

the numerical model of governing equations was solved using a three dimensional pressure based navier stokes solver in a second order implicit time integration unsteady formulation and iterated to achieve a converged solution the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple scheme algorithm patankar and spalding 1972 was employed to deal with the velocity pressure coupling in navier stokes equations a second order upwind spatial discretization was used for the pressure momentum equation turbulent kinetic energy turbulent dissipation rate and least squares cell based formulation for the gradient the simulations are defined as having reached a converged solution when all the residuals are reduced to less than 0 001 2 5 large deformation non linear finite element structural model a large deformation structural finite element model was employed to analyze the structural deformation of the bottom trawl net in the current a six dof degree of freedom truss element was applied to simulate the trawl net in which the truss element was connected with rotatable joints i e the joint cannot withstand the bending moment thus the bottom trawl net was discretized into a series of finite elements corresponding to each individual twine it is possible to calculate the efforts at the extremity of each element using the finite element model these efforts are derived from the factors such as floatability buoyancy weight twine tension and the hydrodynamic force of each twine net these forces are described in this section 2 5 1 external forces the hydrodynamic force on the bottom trawl net was calculated in this paper as the sum of the hydrodynamic force of each twine bar as shown in fig 6 the hydrodynamic force is represented by two forces namely drag force f d and lift force f l the value of hydrodynamic forces on the twine bar is determined from morrison s hypotheses and adapted from landweber and protter 1947 the amplitude of hydrodynamic forces applied on the twine bar ij is given by the following expression 13 f h i j f d i j f l i j ρ 2 u c o s θ s i n θ 2 a i j c d i j c l i j thus the hydrodynamic force acting on the trawl net structure can be calculated based on the solution of the cfd model as 14 f h i j 1 n f h i j where c d is the drag coefficient c l is the lift coefficient a is the cross section area of the twine θ is the attack angle between the twine bar and flow direction and n is the number of twine bars regarding the gravity and buoyancy forces the mass of the twine bar is distributed uniformly over the bordered node therefore these two forces at any node i can be described by the following equation 15 f g f w ρ t w i n e m a t e r i a l ρ g i j 1 n a t i j π 4 ρ t w i n e m a t e r i a l ρ i j 1 n d 2 i j l 0 i j where at represents the area of the cylinder twine and can be expressed as at π 4 d 2 l 0 d is the twine diameter l 0 is the bar length g is the acceleration of gravity ρ t w i n e m a t e r i a l is the density of material and ρ is the density of the water 2 5 2 internal force when the trawl moves with a well defined current speed the twine tends to elongate this elongation depends on the twine materials and is modelled through the elasticity modulus the force due to the tensions in twine can be calculated directly using a nonlinear expression priour 1999b yao et al 2016 the tensions t i j in the twine bar i j can be determined by the following expression 16 t i j e a l i j l 0 l 0 c l i j δ u l 0 where e and a are the young s modulus and cross section area of the twine respectively l i j is the stretched twine length l 0 is the initial twine length δ u is the relative velocity between two knots and c is the damping coefficient of the mesh the twine elongation is associated with the reduction of twine diameter by the poisson s ratio the variation of twine diameter during the twine elongation is defined as 17 δ d ϑ l i j l 0 l 0 where ϑ is the poisson s ratio this diameter variation leads to changes in the twine cross section area and modification of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the twine in the current study the twine diameter variation was neglected because it was very small table 1 2 5 3 dynamics equation it was assumed that the geometric structure of the bottom trawl net in the current was a large deformation nonlinear structure thus the nonlinear theory was adopted to solve the equilibrium position of the fishing net structure the equilibrium equation of the bottom trawl net structure in the geometric non linear theory was obtained according to the shape of the bottom trawl net after deformation in the current according to the virtual force principle newton s second law and the above analysis of force the dynamic equation of the flexible bottom trawl net structure for each mass point is represented as 18 m δ m δ t k l k n δ t f h t f g t f w t i j 1 n t i j t where δ t is a mass point acceleration vector δ t is a mass point displacement vector m and δ m are the mass and added mass of point i respectively k l and k n represent the linear and non linear structural stiffness matrix the added mass is defined as 19 δ m c m ρ v i where c m is an added mass coefficient assumed to be 1 5 herein because the structural connections are considered to be spheres lee et al 2011 chen and yao 2019 according to the models described by bathe et al 1975 johansen et al 2006 and priour 2013 eq 18 can be described as 20 m δ m δ t k l k n δ t f h t f g t f w t i j 1 n t i j t 21 k l v b l t c b l d v 22 k n l v b n t τ b n d v in eqs 20 22 the elements of the linear and nonlinear strain displacement transformation matrices b l and b n respectively and the elements of the incremental material property matrix c are defined with respect to the configuration at time t the term τ is a matrix of cauchy stresses in the configuration at time t as illustrated above the displacement induces a change in the length bar hence the external work is defined as 23 w e f i x i the internal work per twine bar is defined as 24 w i l i j t i j the principle of virtual work implies that the external work is equal to the internal work thus the force component on vertex i along x direction is given as 25 f i t i j l i j x i the linear stain displacement transformation is defined as 26 b l b l 0 b l 1 27 b l 0 f 1 x 1 0 f 2 x 1 0 f n x 1 0 0 f 1 x

hht method hilber et al 1977 and newton raphson method was proposed because the hht method has unconditional stability and second order accuracy accordingly eq 18 can be modified as 30 m δ m δ t δ t 1

number of iterations 2 6 coupling system in the present study two way coupling was used the solutions were based on a partitioned method in which separate solutions were obtained for the different physical fields the system coupling solver was utilized to transfer data between the two domains at each time step as shown in fig 7 one field to be solved is fluid dynamics and the other is structure dynamics at the boundary between the fluids and the trawl net there is fluid trawl net interaction and the solution information is shared between the fluid solver and the structure solver to calculate the effect of trawl net deformation on the water flow and the effect of flow field on the trawl deformation the following fundamental kinematic formulation was applied on the two way coupling interfaces between the water and flexible trawl net structure 34 τ f n f τ s n s δ f δ s where τ f and τ s represent the fluid and trawl net structure stress respectively n f and n s represent the directional unit vectors of fluid and trawl net structure respectively and δ f and δ s are the water particle and knot displacement respectively in the coupling system the first step was to simulate the flow field around trawl structure without considering the deformation using flow solver in this solver only trawl was modelled and the effect of trawl deformation on the flow field was ignored second the hydrodynamic force obtained in the flow solver was transferred to the structural dynamic solver via the fluid structure interaction which provided the boundary conditions for the finite element method fem analysis therefore the dynamic equation can be solved and the deformation of the trawl structure can be obtained third the trawl deformation and node displacement obtained by the resolution of the dynamic equations in the structural dynamic solver were transferred to the flow solver via the coupling system to determine the flow field around the trawl net and the reliable hydrodynamic force finally after interpolating the reliable hydrodynamic force from the fluid mesh into the surface mesh of the trawl net structure a converged solution of the structural dynamics can be obtained under the effect of the acting forces fig 7 to solve the governing equations of the flow field the classical finite volume was used and then several flow parameters were solved the response of the trawl net structure to the emerging load represents a displacement of the structural grid nodes the displacements at the boundary between structure and fluid are interpolated into the fluid mesh which leads to its deformation when the convergence of the loads is transferred across the physical interface the stagger iteration loop will stop pei et al 2014 2 7 calculation of grid and boundary conditions only the flow velocity was included in the fluid load in the present case as shown in fig 5 the boundaries of the numerical simulation flume tank included a flow inlet surface which was modelled as the velocity inlet boundary condition three smooth wall surfaces which were modelled using the wall boundary condition with zero shear force a flow outlet surface which was modelled as outflow boundary condition a free water surface called fluid domain finally the fluid bottom trawl net interaction wall which was applied to define the contact surface between the water flow and the trawl net this was modelled using no slip wall boundary considering the viscosity force between the water flow and the trawl net in ansys fluent cfd solved the flow was influenced by the trawl net deformation by changing the flow geometry the dominant hydrodynamic force component for each bottom trawl net model changed significantly in the structural dynamic solver the face fixed support boundaries were applied to the two trawl bridle fig 8 b unstructured full tetrahedral grids were applied to generate the mesh of numerical simulation flume tank structured grids were applied for the fishing net and the curvature size function curvature normal angle equal to 12 was applied this was done to refine the mesh close to the trawl net using the grid generation tool meshing of ansys workbench 16 0 a ground rate of 2 0 was set around the trawl model the maximum cell size in the computational domain was set to control the distribution fig 8a shows the mesh size distribution for the cfd model and fig 8b the mesh distribution in the structural dynamic model there was a second order accuracy for the discretization in space the second order backward euler scheme was chosen for time discretization the widely accepted richardson extrapolation technique described by shyy et al 2002 and celik et al 2008 was used to estimate discretization error the extrapolated errors for different cases based on the predicted drag force and net deformation are shown in table 3 to quantify the optimal mesh an independent grid analysis was used as shown in table 3 which was conducted for four meshes namely coarse medium fine and finer the extrapolated errors in cfd solver were 9 41 10 22 and 0 59 between the coarse and medium meshes the medium and fine meshes and the fine and finer meshes respectively in the transient structural mechanical solver the errors were 24 04 12 45 and 2 65 between the coarse and medium meshes the medium and fine meshes and the fine and finer meshes respectively the drag force and the deformation increased as the total mesh elements increased table 2a and b the two fine meshes produced very similar drag force and deformation results with a difference lower than 0 6 and 2 58 respectively the comparison between the results obtained with fine mesh and the experimental data showed a difference of 2 7 table 3a in order to achieve accurate simulation results as well as fast calculations fine mesh was applied in the following study fig 8 the chosen time step was 0 001 s and the iteration was stopped when the maximum residual was 10 3 within each time step to obtain the convergence result of unsteady flow simulation 10 time steps and 100 iterations were needed in addition the convergence target for load transfer was 0 001 2 8 data analysis the data regarding bottom trawl net hydrodynamic force trawl geometry trawl deformation and flow velocity distribution obtained from the numerical simulation and flume tank experiment were compared and analyzed to investigate the effects of twine diameter twine materials and mesh size on the hydrodynamic performance and geometric behavior of bottom trawl net the generalized linear model glm and the analysis of covariance ancova were applied to estimate the effect of flow velocity and door spread on the flume tank experiment and on the numerical simulation all statistical procedures were performed using the ibm spss statistics software package and matlab software 3 results 3 1 comparison of hydrodynamic forces between numerical simulation and experimental results fig 9 shows the calculated drag forces from numerical simulation and the measured drag force from flume tank test both the flume tank test and numerical simulation results indicate that the drag force increased quadratically with increasing flow velocity fig 9a the calculated values of drag force by numerical simulation were 1 71 2 57 and 1 67 for trawl nets 1 2 and 3 respectively which were greater than the experimental values at all flow velocities except at 0 91 m s p 0 002 ancova test fig 9b shows that the drag forces obtained by numerical simulation agreed well with the experimental results and the maximum relative error was 1 88 at 1 02 m s 3 88 at 0 57 m s and 3 79 at 0 57 m s p 0 002 ancova test for trawl nets 1 2 and 3 respectively therefore this numerical model can be adopted for the calculation of hydrodynamic forces on average the drag forces obtained by numerical simulation were higher than those obtained by flume tank experiment p 0 005 as shown in table 4 both the numerical and experimental results show that the increase in mesh size led to a decrease in drag force by 56 73 on average p 0 002 ancova test the drag force of trawl net 2 was 52 38 lower than that of trawl net 1 these results also show that the decrease in twine diameter led to drag force reduction by 57 42 on average p 0 005 ancova test thus the drag force of trawl net 3 was 54 55 lower than that of trawl net 1 3 2 numerical and experimental study of flow velocity field inside and around the trawl net the instantaneous velocity fields u x were calculated and measured experimentally using adv method inside and around the trawl net in each plane as shown in fig 4 the vertical distributions of flow velocity fields associated with different points located in each plane around and inside the bottom trawl net structure at the input streamwise velocities of 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s are shown in fig 10 this figure highlights the velocity reduction at different depths along the trawl net structure due to the mass conservation the flow velocity increased gradually along the water depth and then decreased after reaching the peak value it can be observed that the velocity reduction increased with the increase in x direction both for the experimental data and numerical results fig 10a indicates that at y 0 1 m the velocity reduction reached a maximum value when x 63 cm in both numerical and experimental results this maximum velocity reduction was 33 35 at x 225 cm around the third belly near the cod end of trawl net the large difference between the experimental measurement and numerical results of the flow velocity at x 225 cm with the input streamwise velocity of 0 57 m s can be attributed to the measurement reading error and also to the calibration error during experimental measurement which can be estimated as less than 5 in contrast to the results presented in figs 10a and b shows that the velocity reduction reached the maximum value at y 0 2 m at x 99 cm the maximum value of this velocity reduction was 26 47 at x 250 cm around and inside the cod end of trawl net thus the velocity reduction was greater as the x value in the flow direction increased and as the incoming flow velocity decreased it should be noted that the turbulence flow developing around the trawl net was greater at y 0 1 m and 0 2 m around the cod end when the input streamwise velocity was 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s respectively than at other depth positions and parts of trawl net it can be observed that the velocity reduction increased as the mesh size decreased and twine diameter increased greater velocity reduction at the third belly part and the cod end resulted in large energy loss in these trawl net parts which led to the increase in trawl hydrodynamic drag thus as the mesh increased and the twine diameter decreased the flow velocity fields inside and around the trawl net approached the input streamwise velocity consequently the hydrodynamic force decreased and the trawl net was more selective the velocity reduction was very large near the third belly and cod end as shown in table 5 the trend of the numerical simulation data was consistent with the experimental data while the flow velocity fields obtained by experimental measurements were lower than those obtained by numerical results the maximum relative errors were 2 3 and 2 02 when the input streamwise velocities were 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s respectively fig 11 describes the flow velocity field inside the bottom trawl net measured along the centerline fig 11a and b it can be observed that the flow velocity field in the centerline inside the trawl net decreased with the decrease in mesh size for both the numerical and experimental results the flow velocity reduction inside the trawl wing and trawl net body varied from 1 75 to 4 38 at the input streamwise velocity of 0 57 m s the velocity reduction reached a minimum value of 5 26 inside the second and third belly x 125 cm and 200 cm of trawl net and reached a maximum value of 8 77 inside the cod end x 250 cm due to the lower mesh opening when the incoming velocity was 0 68 m s the velocity reduction reached a minimum of 0 9 inside the second belly x 150 cm and reached a maximum reduction of 9 6 inside the third belly near the cod end x 175 cm the flow velocity fields obtained in the numerical simulation were basically consistent with the experimental results for both numerical simulation and experimental results the velocity reduction observed along the centerline inside the trawl net showed that the velocity fluctuation was caused by the discrete distribution of the mesh size and the motion of the trawl net it is worth noting that disturbances of near structure flow in this centerline inside the trawl net were related to the development of turbulent flow this turbulent flow is the boundary layer which is shown directly by the velocity field values the relative error between the numerical simulation and experimental results was about 2 11 indicating that the fluid structure interaction based on two way coupling is effective for calculating the flow velocity variation around trawl net fig 12 shows the experimentally measured velocity contours inside fig 12a and around fig 12b the trawl net the black line indicates the position of bottom trawl net structure the velocity reductions inside and around the trawl net structure can be clearly seen the closer the distance to the cod end and to the structure the lower the velocity distributions this was possibly due to the fact that the mesh size was very small thus limiting the passage of the flow when the flow velocity was 0 68 m s the velocity distributions were higher inside the trawl from the wings to the first belly part compared to other parts of the trawl net the mean velocity measured inside the trawl net was u x 0 48 0 05 m s and 0 61 0 04 m s when the input streamwise velocity was 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s around the trawl net the velocity fields were divided into three main zones low velocity zone 0 3 u 0 0 66 u 0 medium velocity zone 0 66 u 0 0 8 u 0 and high velocity zone 0 8 u 0 0 92 u 0 fig 13 shows the velocity contours of the numerical simulation around the bottom trawl net at velocity magnitude of 0 68 m s the results of x y plan front view and x z plan top view are all shown through the velocity there was a large region of velocity reduction around and downstream of the bottom trawl net the velocity profiles highlight velocity deficits corresponding to the wakes astern of the trawl and the turbulent character of flow around the trawl net fig 13a and a these velocity deficits are due to the development of the turbulent boundary layer flow around the vicinity of the trawl structure and the presence of the vortex shedding in the wake downstream of the bottom trawl net fig 13 it can be observed that the velocity distribution around the trawl net calculated numerically was also divided into three zones low velocity zone 0 25 u 0 0 55 u 0 medium velocity zone 0 55 u 0 0 87 u 0 and high velocity zone 0 8 7 u 0 0 97 u 0 regardless of the normalizing flow fields the thickening of the velocity deficit areas along the structure was notable fig 13c these deficit zones evolved along the different parts of the trawl and more clearly around the trawl body and cod end in addition the flow field also changed according to the mesh opening because the small mesh openings on the trawl body and cod end restricted the flow passage and created a large velocity deficit zone in these parts fig 13c fig 13 also shows the velocity distribution on the vortex core region of the trawl net thus the flow velocity field was greater on the trawl bridle and on the top side of trawl square and trawl body fig 13 a greater difference was observed between the velocity contours obtained numerically and experimentally the experimental and numerical results clearly show that the reduction of flow velocity corresponded to the turbulent boundary layer development around the trawl net structure 3 3 effects of current twine diameter and mesh size on the trawl net structure configuration to quantify the effects of twine diameter mesh size and twine materials on the configuration of the bottom trawl net the total deformation equivalent stress and equivalent elastic strain of different trawl nets were analyzed the configuration of the trawl net structure was mainly evaluated from such aspects as net opening height equivalent stress and equivalent elastic deformation the net mouth height was calculated as the sum of headline height and displacement for each flow velocity the results were compared with flume tank experimental data as shown in fig 14 a it can be observed that the numerical results agreed well with the experimental data according to the numerical simulation and experimental results the net mouth height decreased with the increase in flow velocity at the slowest flow velocity 0 57 m s the net mouth heights of the three model trawl nets were greater than 0 4 m at the highest flow velocity 1 02 m s the net mouth height of both trawl net 1 and trawl net 2 was greater than 0 25 m and that of trawl net 3 was lower than 0 25 m in both the flume tank experimental study and the numerical simulation these results also show that the increase in mesh size and the decrease in twine diameter did not have a great effect on the net opening height fig 14b gives the relative error of net mouth height between numerical simulation results and flume tank experimental results the calculated values of net mouth height of trawl nets 1 and 3 by numerical simulation were significantly lower by 1 16 and 1 53 for trawl nets 1 and 2 respectively than the experimental values p 0 001 glm while that of trawl net 3 was lower than the experimental value by 2 15 table 3 the maximum relative error was 3 86 at 0 8 m s 4 42 at 0 57 m s and 4 82 at 0 8 m s for trawl nets 1 2 and 3 respectively the average net mouth height data are presented in table 6 fig 15 shows that the netting deformation distribution was mainly concentrated at the bottom of the netting therefore the netting experienced greater deformation at its bottom compared to its other parts because the top side of the netting was fixed the total deformation of nylon netting panel solidity ratio equal to 0 027 was greater than that of both dyneema solidity ratio equal to 0 029 and polyethylene solidity ratio equal to 0 071 netting panels one can see that the deformation distribution increased as the mesh size increased and twine diameter decreased fig 15 the calculated equivalent stress and equivalent elastic strain of the model trawl net are shown in fig 16 the equivalent stress and the equivalent elastic strain increased significantly with increase in flow velocity and mesh size and decrease in twine diameter it can be observed that the equivalent stress increased with the increase in equivalent strain the results followed the linear elastic theory because the young s modulus of each material was constant in the whole analysis obeying the hooke s law it should be noted that the equivalent stress of both model trawl nets 2 and 3 was much higher than that of trawl net 1 the equivalent elastic strain of trawl net 3 was much greater than those of trawl nets 1 and 2 also the equivalent stress of model trawl nets 2 and 3 was 61 greater than that of trawl net 1 therefore the decrease in twine diameter using nylon monofilament material and the increase in mesh size using dyneema material led to the increase in equivalent stress and equivalent elastic strain the total deformation represents the maximum value among all the time steps of each point along the trawl net the total deformation values increased with the increase in flow velocity fig 17 thus trawl net 1 was the model with lower mesh size and greater twine diameter its total deformation was 31 and 49 lower than that of trawl nets 2 and 3 respectively 4 discussion during the last few decades the main problem in bottom trawl fishery is the decline in fishery resources and the increase in fuel price thus bottom trawl optimization is necessary to make it more selective less destructive and hydrodynamically efficient this involves reducing the drag force of the bottom trawl to reduce fuel consumption while increasing its sweeping area according to the results of this study the use of numerical simulation considering the fluid structure interaction model and experimental flume test provides valuable knowledge regarding the hydrodynamic forces flow fields and their use in predicting the engineering performance of bottom trawl net the influence of twine diameter mesh size and twine material on the drag force and trawl deformation was demonstrated herein which in turn can influence the geometric performance of the trawl net tang et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 sala et al 2007 based on the results obtained in the present study and those obtained in the previous studies by khaled and priour 2010 balash 2012 sterling 2005 bi et al 2014a 2014b tang et al 2017 and chen and yao 2019 it is evident that the flume tank experimental study and numerical simulation are efficient methods for evaluating the performance of bottom trawl it was also found that the flume tank experimental study is better in terms of precision and the numerical simulation study is better in terms of cost regarding the hydrodynamic performance of the bottom trawl both numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrated good agreement in predicting the hydrodynamic force of trawl net different from the investigations of khaled and priour 2010 tang et al 2017 and wan et al 2019 this study showed that the changes in twine materials twine diameter and mesh size can strongly affect hydrodynamic performance of bottom trawl net by using cfd method as well as a combination of cfd method and large deformation nonlinear structural finite element method in two way coupling indeed the results obtained both experimentally and numerically in the present study showed that the use of nylon monofilament trawl net 3 with twine diameters 61 48 and 54 81 lower than that of trawl nets 1 and 2 respectively led to the corresponding decrease in drag force by 57 42 and 2 84 respectively this trend was confirmed by the experimental studies carried out by wray 2001 ward et al 2005 and kim et al 2007 which showed that the drag force of trawl net decreased as the twine diameter decreased leading to decrease in fuel consumption the present study also demonstrated that the use of dyneema with mesh size 52 22 and 50 56 greater than that of trawl nets 1 and 3 respectively led to 54 58 decrease in drag force this trend was consistent with the studies of wileman and hansen 1988 verhulst and jochems 1993 and balash and sterling 2012 which demonstrated that the increase in mesh size and the use of dyneema material can significantly decrease the drag force of trawl net the modification of the trawl in the present study reduced the drag force by 26 and 31 which is better than the results of sala et al 2008 who increased mesh size and used a strong twine material and wileman and hansen 1988 who used dyneema and also increased the mesh size respectively the simulated results of the bottom trawl hydrodynamic performance were close to the experimental results from the flume tank the average relative errors between drag forces from flume tank model tests and numerical simulations were about 1 71 2 07 and 1 67 for the trawl nets 1 2 and 3 respectively the differences between the numerical and experimental results can arise from the following sources which were difficult to avoid and control the uniformity of input velocity in the flume tank the error caused by the differences between the real net twine used in the flume tank and the cylinders used in the numerical study the setting of the trawl net structure and the measurement error of instruments wan et al 2019 the particularity of this numerical model is that it combines the fluid and solid solvers in two way coupling therefore it takes into account the deformation of trawl net and the flow fields during calculation of the hydrodynamic forces consequently the results of the present study improved upon the results obtained by tang et al 2017 and chen and yao 2019 who used one way fluid structure interaction fsi coupling method and hybrid volume method respectively the relative errors in drag force obtained in the present numerical model were 4 1 12 5 and 20 lower than those obtained in the studies of tang et al 2017 chen and yao 2019 chen and christensen 2016 and patursson et al 2010 respectively this discrepancy could be due to the difference in methods used in these studies in numerical setup experimental setup and the different factors considered in the simulation however it can be concluded that the fsi two way coupling method including sst k ω turbulent model with low reynolds number gives acceptable results compared to the fsi one way coupling method used by tang et al 2017 and the combination of porous media model and lumped mass model in two way coupling used by chen and christensen 2017 although the flume tank experimental study and the numerical simulation produced acceptable results and allowed the prediction of hydrodynamic performance in full scale some factors such as oceanographic conditions wind current swell etc were not taken into account in the simulation and flume tank experiment with regard to the flow velocity field inside and around the bottom trawl net the present study and previous studies by kim 2012 2013 pichot et al 2009 bouhoubeiny et al 2014 and druault et al 2015 demonstrated that the flow developing inside and around the bottom trawl is turbulent and particularly of the boundary layer type and the turbulence is due to the trawl wake it is clear that the development of this turbulent flow has an impact on drag force and fish behavior and therefore affects the bottom trawl net selectivity indeed according to the studies of kim 2013 and bi et al 2017 the velocity reduction around fishing net decreased as the mesh opening increased and the twine diameter decreased this lower flow velocity reduction and the large passage of flow through the mesh opening decreased the hydrodynamic force and made the trawl more selective pichot et al 2009 bouhoubeiny 2012 when the flow velocity was great 0 68 m s the mesh structure rose to its highest amplitude the spatial extent of the outer and internal turbulence flow was greater than that of the bottom trawl net structure when the flow velocity was low 0 57 m s this hypothesis was also evoked by bouhoubeiny 2012 the present study demonstrated that the higher velocity reduction was due to the hindrance of the mesh opening and twine diameter on the passage of the flow bouhoubeiny 2012 the turbulent stress characteristics in the wake region central line of a bottom trawl are close to that of a cylinder or sphere djeridi et al 2003 govardhan et al 2005 thus the velocity reductions around and inside the trawl were higher than those obtained by pichot 2007 and bouhoubeiny et al 2014 in their studies of the flow characteristics around the trawl net structure this difference was likely due to the measurement method used the type of structure used and the experimental conditions for both the measurements from the flume tank test using the adv method and calculated values using numerical simulation the maximum velocity reduction inside the trawl net near the cod end was 18 in contrast according to the results obtained by vincent 1996 and theret 1998 the measured velocity inside the bottom trawl net and near the cod end was close to the trawling speed this difference between our results and the previous work could be due to the fact that the present flow measurement was very limited thus it would be advisable to carry out more flow velocity field measurements in this study trawl net 2 was designed to show the effect of increasing the mesh size and trawl net 3 was designed to show the effect of decreasing the twine diameter on the trawl net configuration and the hydrodynamic performances the results showed that decreasing the twine diameter and increasing the mesh size significantly increased the vertical and horizontal deformations of the bottom trawl net and decreased its drag force according to the results obtained by tang et al 2017 and the results of the present study the net mouth heights obtained experimentally were greater than those obtained by numerical simulation for trawl nets 1 and 2 in contrast for trawl net 3 the numerical simulation results were greater than those obtained experimentally in the flume tank using dynami t software nguyen et al 2015 found that the net mouth height value obtained in numerical simulation was lower than that obtained in the flume tank experiment this discrepancy can be due to the differences in the simulation software used the method used the simulation conditions and the trawl design fiorentini et al 2004 by comparing the structural deformation numerical results it was evident that there was a very large difference between these trawl net models note that trawl net 3 was the model with the greatest equivalent stress equivalent elastic strain and total deformation compared to the other model trawl nets indeed the deformation of fishing gear with the bending stiffness is affected by many factors such as the elasticity of the twine material the twine diameter the mesh size the material density and initial deformations of fishing gear flexibility gansel et al 2013 o neill 2002 priour 1999a 2009 equivalent stress equivalent elastic strain net mouth height and total deformation vary based on the material twine diameter and mesh size therefore estimates of these parameters are very useful in the quantitative analysis of resistance and deformation of a bottom trawl net during the interaction between the fluid fishing gear and the fish and also in the hydrodynamic efficiency and selectivity of the trawl net o neill 1999 priour 1999a sala et al 2007 tang et al 2017 the methods presented here are useful for investigating the effect of twine diameter and mesh size on bottom trawl deformation and can be used for trawl nets with similar characteristics scientifically understanding and documenting the performance of trawls in the fishing industry development and application of numerical modelling in the design and efficiency improvement of fishing gear and study of the turbulent flow development inside and around fishing gear are all important research areas however further efforts are still required to address outstanding issues therefore future work will be focused on a further testing of bottom trawl net models using more twine materials decreasing twine diameter increasing mesh size and combining changes in twine diameter and mesh size which will create a more powerful set of data to robustly define the efficiency of trawl net and reduce fuel consumption b variations in the flow velocity field inside and around the different parts of the trawl net for more realistic and reliable calculation of the hydrodynamic drag however it is advisable to collect an experimental database on the velocity field inside and around the fishing gear with more reliable methods such as the particle image velocimetry method piv and laser doppler velocimetry method ldv for flow measurements inside and around the different parts of trawl net these measurements will make it possible to precisely characterize the flows developing inside and around the trawl net thus facilitating the study of its impact on the hydrodynamic performances and the selectivity of this fishing gear in order to improve the numerical tools software for the simulation of fishing gear the characteristics of the flow obtained experimentally are very important and should be considered 5 conclusion the effects of twine diameter mesh size and twine material on the hydrodynamic performance of flow fields around the trawl net were experimentally and numerically investigated the proposed numerical model for simulating the interaction between flow and flexible trawl net structure was based on fsi with two way coupling in the numerical model rans model in conjunction with the k ω sst model was solved by the finite volume method and was applied to describe the flow field around the trawl net the large deformation non linear structural finite element method was applied to describe the deformation of the trawl net structure and to capture the knots displacement the hydrodynamic forces of flow fields around the bottom trawl net were evaluated through numerical simulation and experiments the following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this work 1 the proposed fsi method in this study can integrate the effect of node displacement on the flow field around the trawl and integrate the effect of the structure flow field on the mesh deformation also the geometric shapes used for the flow simulation and the structure mechanics are independent of each other these characteristics make the fsi two way coupling especially suitable for fluid structure coupling analysis of meshes with large deformation 2 the relative error between the numerical model data and the experimental data was less than 2 1 4 5 and 2 4 respectively for hydrodynamic forces net mouth height and velocity fields inside and around the bottom trawl net therefore this method is suitable to simulate the flow around the trawl net calculate the drag forces of trawl net and quantify the deformation of the trawl net 3 when the flow velocity was very high the mesh structure rose to its highest amplitude the spatial extent of the outer and internal turbulence flow was greater than that of the bottom trawl net structure when the flow velocity was low also the velocity reduction measurements carried out experimentally in the flume tank test using the adv method inside the trawl net were about 18 5 and 16 less than those at lower 0 57 m s and higher 0 68 m s flow velocity respectively 4 the equivalent stress equivalent elastic strain and total deformation were greatly influenced by flow velocity twine diameter and mesh size their values increased with increasing flow velocity increasing mesh size and decreasing twine diameter 5 the use of high strength materials such as nylon monofilament and dyneema resulted in lower drag force on the bottom trawl structure thus it would be beneficial to select one of the two for trawl design 6 the results obtained in the flow field measurements can have direct applications in the implementation of numerical software for fishing gear design which can improve fishing gear mechanics using numerical simulation in china in particular post processing and analysis of the different databases will allow validation of numerical simulations and also provide data to initialize the

20631,in this work the hydrodynamic performance of a scaled bottom trawl model in current was investigated by using numerical simulations based on the fluid structure interaction fsi method in two way coupling and the flume tank test based on modified tauti s law in this numerical model a finite volume approach was used for solving the navier stokes equations combined with a k ω shear stress turbulent sst model for describing the flow a finite element approach was used for solving the large deformation nonlinear structural dynamic equation to describe the trawl net configuration and the nodal displacement a series of flume tank tests was conducted on three scaled bottom trawl models with different twine diameters twine materials and mesh sizes in addition three dimensional 3d acoustic doppler velocimeter adv measurements were performed to experimentally investigate the effect of turbulent flow on the bottom trawl net performance the comparisons showed that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental data both the numerical and experimental results indicated that the increase in mesh size using dyneema multifilament and the decrease in twine diameter using nylon monofilament led to decrease in the drag force by about 2 1 times and 2 2 times respectively p 0 002 ancova test it was found that there was spatial development of turbulent boundary layer flow around the trawl net and the vortex shedding in the trawl wake in addition the equivalent stress elastic strain and total deformation increased with the increase in flow velocity and mesh size and the decrease in twine diameter keywords bottom trawl k ω shear stress turbulent sst model acoustic doppler velocimeter large deformation non linear structural finite element model velocity reduction hydrodynamic forces 1 introduction efficient bottom trawl nets are essential for the coastal fishing industry rising fuel prices and declining fish stocks have an enormous impact on the entire coastal fishing industry since fuel cost and catchability are the major components of the operation cost and ecosystem impact respectively the reasons for this are the high drag low sweep area and nonselective nature of the bottom trawl net therefore optimum structural design of the bottom trawl is necessary to reduce the fuel consumption increase the swept area reduce the by catch and improve the efficiency mchugh et al 2016 marlen et al 2014 to improve profitability and ensure sustainability of the resources many researchers have worked and continue to find ways to make bottom trawls more efficient and selective the dynamic behavior of a bottom trawl is largely affected by its shape design construction rigging as well as the hydrodynamic forces experienced while towing along the seabed kim et al 2007 khaled et al 2012 nguyen 2016 during the trawling process the trawl mesh is deformed by the impact of water flow and the distribution of the surrounding flow field changes considerably this change in the flow field further affects the hydrodynamic force of the mesh chen and yao 2019 understanding the dynamic behavior and performance of these structures prior to expensive sea trials is a key step in the fishing gear development cycle winger et al 2006 nguyen et al 2015 in particular numerical simulation is becoming one of the popular methods for evaluating trawl designs and assessing their performance during the early stages of gear development nguyen 2016 the dynamic behavior and performance of bottom trawls have been studied for several decades using various theoretical and experimental methods tauti 1934 dickson 1961 fridman 1973 fiorentini et al 2004 historically these experiments were carried out using engineering models in flume tanks or full scale prototypes at sea however during the last two decades numerical simulation has emerged as a new and powerful tool for understanding the dynamic behavior of trawl net systems based on hydrodynamic theory and principles a fishing gear system can now be mathematically modelled the numerical model allows the prediction of its dynamic performance under the influence of various forces in the aquatic environment external forces such as drag force shearing force sinking force and buoyancy and the properties of the materials used elasticity and stiffness of twines numerical modeling of fishing gear systems has improved substantially in recent years with major advancements in mathematical theory numerical simulation methods and computational fluid dynamics method bessonneau and marichal 1998 takagi et al 2002 lee et al 2011 sun et al 2011 khaled et al 2012 chen et al 2014 li et al 2015 yao et al 2016a tang et al 2017 today many gear designers researchers and manufacturers prefer to begin with numerical simulation of initial conceptual ideas followed by an experimental flume tank winger et al 2006 eventually full scale prototypes are constructed and evaluated under real fishing conditions for their mechanical performance and catchability although numerical simulation and flume tank experiments have their respective advantages and limitations they have been proven to be complementary tools for predicting the performance of full scale fishing gear patursson et al 2010 queirolo et al 2009 nguyen 2016 several studies have been conducted to investigate the engineering performance of the fishing gear system ward et al 2005 and kim et al 2007 conducted an experimental study related to the impact of reduction of twine diameter and increase in mesh sizes on the fuel consumption in trawling they observed a significant decrease in fuel consumption with the decrease in twine diameter and increase in mesh size priour 2005 developed a finite element method for simulating flexible structures made of nettings cables and bars such as fishing gear and fish farming cage which focused on a specific triangular element devoted to net modeling mulvany et al 2004 estimated the hydrodynamic forces on trawl doors using computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis by solving the navier stokes equations with a finite element method pichot 2007 developed a simulation of the flow around and inside a rigid axisymmetric net kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 proposed and discussed a screen type force model for the viscous hydrodynamic load on nets assuming that the net is divided into several flat net panels bouhoubeiny 2012 studied the characteristics of flow governing the hydrodynamic behavior of bottom trawls balash 2012 developed a novel experimental technique to quantify the flexural rigidity of nets zhao et al 2013a 2013b proposed a numerical model based on a porous media fluid model and simulated the flow fields around tandem net cages cornejo et al 2014 numerically studied the flow velocity distribution downstream from a salmon farm in the semidiurnal current chen and christensen 2016 developed a numerical model based on openfoam to study steady current flow through planar net panels and circular fish cages yao et al 2016a 2016b proposed a novel hybrid volume method to analyze the interaction between the net mesh and the surrounding flow field which was used to calculate the interaction between the fluid and net cage under large deformation conditions tang et al 2017 also developed a numerical model to analyze the flow field through the trawl by proposing the deformation of the trawl using fluid structure interaction one way coupling the numerical approach involved combining the k ω shear stress turbulent sst model with the high strain nonlinear finite element method to simulate the interaction between the flow and the trawl with unidirectional coupling techniques chen and yao 2019 also adopted the hybrid volume method to describe fluid trawl interaction first they modelled the trawl net and the flow field based on the lumped mass method and finite volume method separately then they adopted a hybrid volume method hvm to model the fluid structure interaction between the net and surrounding water although chen and christensen 2017 used two way coupling method to simulate the dynamic deformation of the structure and the velocity reduction of the fluid they focused on fish cage however the effect of flow on trawl net structure and the influence of trawl net structure deformation on flow field have both been ignored in the previous studies it is still necessary to analyze the effects of the trawl net deformation twine diameter mesh size and twine diameter on the drag force and the flow field inside and around the trawl net thus the fluid structure interaction fsi two way coupling is necessary to better understand trawl net system performance this study aimed to perform fsi simulation for investigating the influences of twine diameter twine material and mesh size on the hydrodynamic performance of bottom trawl net and to analyze the flow field inside and around it with two way coupling and experimental flume tank a numerical model was constructed based on the two way coupling technique by combining the k ω sst model and the large deformation nonlinear structural finite element model the results were validated with the data obtained by flume tank experiment furthermore the flow field profile obtained in the numerical simulation was analyzed and compared with acoustic doppler velocimetry measurements adv data the comparison between the results of the proposed model and the experimental results showed a difference of 3 therefore it is necessary to consider the coupling effect of the trawl structure deformation and flow field in two way coupling in the modeling of trawl net the findings are expected to contribute to the improvement of coastal bottom trawl net performance 2 materials and methods numerical simulation was performed for analyzing the effect of flow field and structural deformation on the bottom trawl performance and the results were compared with those obtained experimentally in the flume tank the main concept of the numerical approach involved combining cfd method and the large deformation nonlinear finite element method to simulate the interaction between flow and trawl with two way coupling techniques a finite volume approach was used for solving the navier stokes equations combined with a k ω sst model to describe the flow field and capture the turbulence formation around the trawl net moreover the large deformation nonlinear structural model was applied to describe the trawl net structure configuration and to capture the node displacement and trawl deformation this numerical model was successfully performed using ansys workbench software fluent solver and transient structural mechanical solver the numerical simulations were performed using a computer with intel xeon cpu e5 2690 v2 3 0 ghz 2 64 core processors 64 gb ram and 2 tb ssd disk for data writing a more detailed description of the numerical model is given below 2 1 model trawl nets configuration the trawl net models used in this study were 1 18 scale models of a coastal bottom trawl net commonly used by both japanese and korean coastal bottom trawlers as shown in fig 1 overall three trawl net models were built with different twine materials polyethylene dyneema and nylon monofilament mesh sizes and twine diameters table 1 each net had different mesh numbers and twine areas table 2 all three models had the same total stretched length 2 59 m same headline length 2 10 m same footrope length 2 674 m and bridle length of 2 5 m this study evaluated the effects of varying the twine diameter mesh size and twine material on the hydrodynamic drag force and the deformation of bottom trawl net thus trawl net models 2 and 3 were constructed from trawl net 1 by changing the material mesh size and twine diameter on the first belly the square part and the wing end the mesh size of trawl net 2 was 33 5 larger than that of trawls 1 and 3 with a twine diameter about 14 75 lower than that of trawl 1 the twine diameter of trawl net 3 was 61 21 times smaller than that of trawl nets 1 and 2 with the mesh size 3 37 greater than that of trawl net 1 2 2 experiment process experiments for the hydrodynamic forces and flow field measurements around the trawl net were performed in a flume tank at tokyo university of marine sciences and technology tumst to validate the numerical results the test section of the flume tank was 9 m long 2 2 m wide and 1 6 m deep the scaling of physical models was based on the modified tauti s law proposed by hu et al 2001 the basic setup of the flume model test is shown in fig 2 for controlled trawl drag measurements in the flume tank the bridles of trawl nets were attached to two vertical bars and the flow meter was fixed on the bars fig 2 each trawl net model connection point contained a load cell which allowed measurement of the frame line tension at all connection points for each case these two bars also ensured the horizontal opening of trawl model fig 2 the hydrodynamic forces of the three model trawl nets were measured at flow velocities of 0 57 m s 0 68 m s 0 8 m s 0 91 m s and 1 02 m s and at door spread values of 1 6 m 1 8 m and 2 0 m respectively the tensions of the towing point were measured with two load cells of 196 14 n capacity each the load cells were calibrated and zeroed at both the beginning and end of testing the total trawl drag force for a given model at certain flow velocity was calculated from the sum of the two bridle tension measurements multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the bridle and flow direction estimated at 23 41 in this study to study the turbulent flow developing inside and around a bottom trawl net the three dimensional acoustic doppler velocimeter adv system was used to determine u v and w velocity components along the x y and z directions respectively the adv manufactured by nortek with a specified accuracy of 1 mm s was introduced in the water during the experiment to measure the flow velocity at different points inside and around trawl net figs 2 and 3 a steel frame was used to keep the vector device in the orthogonal position and to protect the device sensor from obstacles fig 3 at each measurement point velocity data was sampled for a duration of 20 s at a sampling rate of 20 hz thus the three components of velocity data were assessed every 20 s in order to gain an understanding of the flow characteristics of the flume tank and the nature of the flow to give better confidence in the results of flow measurements inside and around the trawl the experimental data of flow measurement without the presence of fishing gear done by hu et al 2004 was used and analyzed this analysis showed that when the flow velocity through the flume tank was varied from 0 1 to 2 0 m s the turbulence level varied between 2 and 20 and the acceleration flow varied between 1 0 and 5 0 cm s 2 the reciprocating oscillation flow of velocity amplitude was 0 5 m s the measurements of velocity distribution on the working section including near surface and bottom showed that the deviation of velocity obtained in each measurement point was within 2 0 of the mean velocity and within 1 0 on the near center part steady wave height and water level fluctuation on free surface were no more than 1 5 mm and 2 0 mm with flow velocity of 1 5 m s respectively the model trawl net located at the bottom of the flume tank was free to move in the water flow fig 3 for such a configuration the conveyor belt was synchronized with the flow velocity the measurements of velocity fields were performed with two different fixed input streamwise velocities of 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s and the results were compared with those obtained by numerical simulation the instantaneous velocity field measurements were performed on eleven adv planes represented by the red lines in fig 4 which corresponded to the low and high positions of the bottom trawl net structure the velocity measurement was performed on each redline plane and the distance between two planes was 25 cm along the flow direction figs 2 and 4 in vertical direction the distance between two measurement points in the same redline was 10 cm and the maximum depth of experimental velocity field measurement was 40 cm figs 2 and 4 the corresponding reynolds number based on the diamond shaped meshes and the upstream velocity v is given by 1 re v l ν where v is flow velocity ν is kinematic viscosity and l is mesh size thus the studied reynolds numbers are 7463 31 and 8872 32 at flow velocities of 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s respectively 2 3 numerical modeling setup to reduce the boundary effect of the numerical flume tank and to avoid the iteration divergence of numerical modelling fluent solver the numerical water tank dimensions adopted to calculate the hydrodynamic forces acting on trawl net were 9 0 m 2 2 m x 1 6 m length x width x depth fig 5 the different trawl nets and nettings used in the numerical simulation were a series of separate cylinders connected together the flow velocities applied in the numerical simulation were the same as those used in the flume tank experiment 2 4 fluid flow model in this study the flow was considered as a viscous three dimensional unsteady boundary layer turbulent flow a cfd based scheme was used to solve the interaction between the flow and the trawl net in numerical water tank the governing equations of the flow model were solved using the finite volume method together with the k ω sst model the motion of the three dimensional incompressible flow is described by the system of reynold averaged navier stokes rans equations with reynold stress approximated by eddy viscosity model the continuity and momentum equations are given as follows ferziger and peric 2002 2 ρ t ρ u 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i ρ g i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s i where t is time μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity g i is the gravitational force ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress ρ is the fluid density u i represents the velocity components x i represents the spatial coordinates u i is the fluctuation velocity s i is a source term for the momentum equation which describes the water resistance force acting on trawl net and i j 1 2 3 x y z p is the transient pressure which is determined by the following equation 4 p t p t 2 3 ρ k where p is the time average pressure and k is the turbulent kinetic energy in the present numerical simulation the sst turbulence model menter 1994 is added to eqs 2 and 3 to model the reynolds stresses the sst k ω turbulence model is a two equation eddy viscosity model combining the original k ϵ and wilcox k ω models menter 1994 the use of k ω formulation in the inner parts of the boundary layer makes the model directly useable all the way down to the wall through the viscous sub layer hence the sst k ω model can be used as a low reynolds turbulence model without any extra damping functions the sst formulation also switches to a k ϵ behavior in the free stream and thereby avoids the common k ω problem of high sensitivity of the model to the inlet stream turbulence properties another advantage this model is its good behavior in adverse pressure gradients and separating flow in addition this model produces slightly high turbulence levels in regions with large normal strain such as stagnation regions and regions with strong acceleration thus as the reynolds number in this study is lower and due to all the above mentioned advantages this model is appropriate for the simulation of the flow field around the trawl net the k ω sst turbulent model is governed by 5 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k β ρ ω k x j μ σ k μ t k x j

the numerical model of governing equations was solved using a three dimensional pressure based navier stokes solver in a second order implicit time integration unsteady formulation and iterated to achieve a converged solution the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple scheme algorithm patankar and spalding 1972 was employed to deal with the velocity pressure coupling in navier stokes equations a second order upwind spatial discretization was used for the pressure momentum equation turbulent kinetic energy turbulent dissipation rate and least squares cell based formulation for the gradient the simulations are defined as having reached a converged solution when all the residuals are reduced to less than 0 001 2 5 large deformation non linear finite element structural model a large deformation structural finite element model was employed to analyze the structural deformation of the bottom trawl net in the current a six dof degree of freedom truss element was applied to simulate the trawl net in which the truss element was connected with rotatable joints i e the joint cannot withstand the bending moment thus the bottom trawl net was discretized into a series of finite elements corresponding to each individual twine it is possible to calculate the efforts at the extremity of each element using the finite element model these efforts are derived from the factors such as floatability buoyancy weight twine tension and the hydrodynamic force of each twine net these forces are described in this section 2 5 1 external forces the hydrodynamic force on the bottom trawl net was calculated in this paper as the sum of the hydrodynamic force of each twine bar as shown in fig 6 the hydrodynamic force is represented by two forces namely drag force f d and lift force f l the value of hydrodynamic forces on the twine bar is determined from morrison s hypotheses and adapted from landweber and protter 1947 the amplitude of hydrodynamic forces applied on the twine bar ij is given by the following expression 13 f h i j f d i j f l i j ρ 2 u c o s θ s i n θ 2 a i j c d i j c l i j thus the hydrodynamic force acting on the trawl net structure can be calculated based on the solution of the cfd model as 14 f h i j 1 n f h i j where c d is the drag coefficient c l is the lift coefficient a is the cross section area of the twine θ is the attack angle between the twine bar and flow direction and n is the number of twine bars regarding the gravity and buoyancy forces the mass of the twine bar is distributed uniformly over the bordered node therefore these two forces at any node i can be described by the following equation 15 f g f w ρ t w i n e m a t e r i a l ρ g i j 1 n a t i j π 4 ρ t w i n e m a t e r i a l ρ i j 1 n d 2 i j l 0 i j where at

density of material and ρ is the density of the water 2 5 2 internal force when the trawl moves with a well defined current speed the twine tends to elongate this elongation depends on the twine materials and is modelled through the elasticity modulus the force due to the tensions in twine can be calculated directly using a nonlinear expression priour 1999b yao et al 2016 the tensions t i j in the twine bar i j can be determined by the following expression 16 t i j e a l i j l 0 l 0 c l i j δ u l 0 where e and a are the young s modulus and cross section area of the twine respectively l i j is the stretched twine length l 0 is the initial twine length δ u is the relative velocity between two knots and c is the damping coefficient of the mesh the twine elongation is associated with the reduction of twine diameter by the poisson s ratio the variation of twine diameter during the twine elongation is defined as 17 δ d ϑ l i j l 0 l 0 where ϑ is the poisson s ratio this diameter variation leads to changes in the twine cross section area and modification of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the twine in the current study the twine diameter variation was neglected because it was very small table 1 2 5 3 dynamics equation it was assumed that the geometric structure of the bottom trawl net in the current was a large deformation nonlinear structure thus the nonlinear theory was adopted to solve the equilibrium position of the fishing net structure the equilibrium equation of the bottom trawl net structure in the geometric non linear theory was obtained according to the shape of the bottom trawl net after deformation in the current according to the virtual force principle newton s second law and the above analysis of force the dynamic equation of the flexible bottom trawl net structure for each mass point is represented as 18 m δ m δ t k l k n δ t f h t f g t f w t i j 1 n t i j t where δ t is a mass point acceleration vector δ t is a mass point displacement vector m and δ m are the mass and added mass of point i respectively k l and k n represent the linear and non linear structural stiffness matrix the added mass is defined as 19 δ m c m ρ v i where c m is an added mass coefficient assumed to be 1 5 herein because the structural connections are considered to be spheres lee et al 2011 chen and yao 2019 according to the models described by bathe et al 1975 johansen et al 2006 and priour 2013 eq 18 can be described as 20 m δ m δ t k l k n δ t f h t f g t f w t i j 1 n t i j t 21 k l v b l t c b l d v 22 k n l v b n t τ b n d v in eqs 20 22 the elements of the linear and nonlinear strain displacement transformation matrices b l and b n respectively and the elements of the incremental material property matrix c are defined with respect to the configuration at time t the term τ is a matrix of cauchy stresses in the configuration at time t as illustrated above the displacement induces a change in the length bar hence the external work is defined as 23 w e f i x i the internal work per twine bar is defined as 24 w i l i j t i j the principle of virtual work implies that the external work is equal to the internal work thus the force component on vertex i along x direction is given as 25 f i t i j l i j x i the linear stain displacement transformation is defined as 26 b l b l 0 b l 1 27 b l 0 f 1 x 1 0 f 2 x 1 0 f n x 1 0 0 f 1 x

hht method hilber et al 1977 and newton raphson method was proposed because the hht method has unconditional stability and second order accuracy accordingly eq 18 can be modified as 30 m δ m δ t δ t 1

number of iterations 2 6 coupling system in the present study two way coupling was used the solutions were based on a partitioned method in which separate solutions were obtained for the different physical fields the system coupling solver was utilized to transfer data between the two domains at each time step as shown in fig 7 one field to be solved is fluid dynamics and the other is structure dynamics at the boundary between the fluids and the trawl net there is fluid trawl net interaction and the solution information is shared between the fluid solver and the structure solver to calculate the effect of trawl net deformation on the water flow and the effect of flow field on the trawl deformation the following fundamental kinematic formulation was applied on the two way coupling interfaces between the water and flexible trawl net structure 34 τ f n f τ s n s δ f δ s where τ f and τ s represent the fluid and trawl net structure stress respectively n f and n s represent the directional unit vectors of fluid and trawl net structure respectively and δ f and δ s are the water particle and knot displacement respectively in the coupling system the first step was to simulate the flow field around trawl structure without considering the deformation using flow solver in this solver only trawl was modelled and the effect of trawl deformation on the flow field was ignored second the hydrodynamic force obtained in the flow solver was transferred to the structural dynamic solver via the fluid structure interaction which provided the boundary conditions for the finite element method fem analysis therefore the dynamic equation can be solved and the deformation of the trawl structure can be obtained third the trawl deformation and node displacement obtained by the resolution of the dynamic equations in the structural dynamic solver were transferred to the flow solver via the coupling system to determine the flow field around the trawl net and the reliable hydrodynamic force finally after interpolating the reliable hydrodynamic force from the fluid mesh into the surface mesh of the trawl net structure a converged solution of the structural dynamics can be obtained under the effect of the acting forces fig 7 to solve the governing equations of the flow field the classical finite volume was used and then several flow parameters were solved the response of the trawl net structure to the emerging load represents a displacement of the structural grid nodes the displacements at the boundary between structure and fluid are interpolated into the fluid mesh which leads to its deformation when the convergence of the loads is transferred across the physical interface the stagger iteration loop will stop pei et al 2014 2 7 calculation of grid and boundary conditions only the flow velocity was included in the fluid load in the present case as shown in fig 5 the boundaries of the numerical simulation flume tank included a flow inlet surface which was modelled as the velocity inlet boundary condition three smooth wall surfaces which were modelled using the wall boundary condition with zero shear force a flow outlet surface which was modelled as outflow boundary condition a free water surface called fluid domain finally the fluid bottom trawl net interaction wall which was applied to define the contact surface between the water flow and the trawl net this was modelled using no slip wall boundary considering the viscosity force between the water flow and the trawl net in ansys fluent cfd solved the flow was influenced by the trawl net deformation by changing the flow geometry the dominant hydrodynamic force component for each bottom trawl net model changed significantly in the structural dynamic solver the face fixed support boundaries were applied to the two trawl bridle fig 8 b unstructured full tetrahedral grids were applied to generate the mesh of numerical simulation flume tank structured grids were applied for the fishing net and the curvature size function curvature normal angle equal to 12 was applied this was done to refine the mesh close to the trawl net using the grid generation tool meshing of ansys workbench 16 0 a ground rate of 2 0 was set around the trawl model the maximum cell size in the computational domain was set to control the distribution fig 8a shows the mesh size distribution for the cfd model and fig 8b the mesh distribution in the structural dynamic model there was a second order accuracy for the discretization in space the second order backward euler scheme was chosen for time discretization the widely accepted richardson extrapolation technique described by shyy et al 2002 and celik et al 2008 was used to estimate discretization error the extrapolated errors for different cases based on the predicted drag force and net deformation are shown in table 3 to quantify the optimal mesh an independent grid analysis was used as shown in table 3 which was conducted for four meshes namely coarse medium fine and finer the extrapolated errors in cfd solver were 9 41 10 22 and 0 59 between the coarse and medium meshes the medium and fine meshes and the fine and finer meshes respectively in the transient structural mechanical solver the errors were 24 04 12 45 and 2 65 between the coarse and medium meshes the medium and fine meshes and the fine and finer meshes respectively the drag force and the deformation increased as the total mesh elements increased table 2a and b the two fine meshes produced very similar drag force and deformation results with a difference lower than 0 6 and 2 58 respectively the comparison between the results obtained with fine mesh and the experimental data showed a difference of 2 7 table 3a in order to achieve accurate simulation results as well as fast calculations fine mesh was applied in the following study fig 8 the chosen time step was 0 001 s and the iteration was stopped when the maximum residual was 10 3 within each time step to obtain the convergence result of unsteady flow simulation 10 time steps and 100 iterations were needed in addition the convergence target for load transfer was 0 001 2 8 data analysis the data regarding bottom trawl net hydrodynamic force trawl geometry trawl deformation and flow velocity distribution obtained from the numerical simulation and flume tank experiment were compared and analyzed to investigate the effects of twine diameter twine materials and mesh size on the hydrodynamic performance and geometric behavior of bottom trawl net the generalized linear model glm and the analysis of covariance ancova were applied to estimate the effect of flow velocity and door spread on the flume tank experiment and on the numerical simulation all statistical procedures were performed using the ibm spss statistics software package and matlab software 3 results 3 1 comparison of hydrodynamic forces between numerical simulation and experimental results fig 9 shows the calculated drag forces from numerical simulation and the measured drag force from flume tank test both the flume tank test and numerical simulation results indicate that the drag force increased quadratically with increasing flow velocity fig 9a the calculated values of drag force by numerical simulation were 1 71 2 57 and 1 67 for trawl nets 1 2 and 3 respectively which were greater than the experimental values at all flow velocities except at 0 91 m s p 0 002 ancova test fig 9b shows that the drag forces obtained by numerical simulation agreed well with the experimental results and the maximum relative error was 1 88 at 1 02 m s 3 88 at 0 57 m s and 3 79 at 0 57 m s p 0 002 ancova test for trawl nets 1 2 and 3 respectively therefore this numerical model can be adopted for the calculation of hydrodynamic forces on average the drag forces obtained by numerical simulation were higher than those obtained by flume tank experiment p 0 005 as shown in table 4 both the numerical and experimental results show that the increase in mesh size led to a decrease in drag force by 56 73 on average p 0 002 ancova test the drag force of trawl net 2 was 52 38 lower than that of trawl net 1 these results also show that the decrease in twine diameter led to drag force reduction by 57 42 on average p 0 005 ancova test thus the drag force of trawl net 3 was 54 55 lower than that of trawl net 1 3 2 numerical and experimental study of flow velocity field inside and around the trawl net the instantaneous velocity fields u x were calculated and measured experimentally using adv method inside and around the trawl net in each plane as shown in fig 4 the vertical distributions of flow velocity fields associated with different points located in each plane around and inside the bottom trawl net structure at the input streamwise velocities of 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s are shown in fig 10 this figure highlights the velocity reduction at different depths along the trawl net structure due to the mass conservation the flow velocity increased gradually along the water depth and then decreased after reaching the peak value it can be observed that the velocity reduction increased with the increase in x direction both for the experimental data and numerical results fig 10a indicates that at y 0 1 m the velocity reduction reached a maximum value when x 63 cm in both numerical and experimental results this maximum velocity reduction was 33 35 at x 225 cm around the third belly near the cod end of trawl net the large difference between the experimental measurement and numerical results of the flow velocity at x 225 cm with the input streamwise velocity of 0 57 m s can be attributed to the measurement reading error and also to the calibration error during experimental measurement which can be estimated as less than 5 in contrast to the results presented in figs 10a and b shows that the velocity reduction reached the maximum value at y 0 2 m at x 99 cm the maximum value of this velocity reduction was 26 47 at x 250 cm around and inside the cod end of trawl net thus the velocity reduction was greater as the x value in the flow direction increased and as the incoming flow velocity decreased it should be noted that the turbulence flow developing around the trawl net was greater at y 0 1 m and 0 2 m around the cod end when the input streamwise velocity was 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s respectively than at other depth positions and parts of trawl net it can be observed that the velocity reduction increased as the mesh size decreased and twine diameter increased greater velocity reduction at the third belly part and the cod end resulted in large energy loss in these trawl net parts which led to the increase in trawl hydrodynamic drag thus as the mesh increased and the twine diameter decreased the flow velocity fields inside and around the trawl net approached the input streamwise velocity consequently the hydrodynamic force decreased and the trawl net was more selective the velocity reduction was very large near the third belly and cod end as shown in table 5 the trend of the numerical simulation data was consistent with the experimental data while the flow velocity fields obtained by experimental measurements were lower than those obtained by numerical results the maximum relative errors were 2 3 and 2 02 when the input streamwise velocities were 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s respectively fig 11 describes the flow velocity field inside the bottom trawl net measured along the centerline fig 11a and b it can be observed that the flow velocity field in the centerline inside the trawl net decreased with the decrease in mesh size for both the numerical and experimental results the flow velocity reduction inside the trawl wing and trawl net body varied from 1 75 to 4 38 at the input streamwise velocity of 0 57 m s the velocity reduction reached a minimum value of 5 26 inside the second and third belly x 125 cm and 200 cm of trawl net and reached a maximum value of 8 77 inside the cod end x 250 cm due to the lower mesh opening when the incoming velocity was 0 68 m s the velocity reduction reached a minimum of 0 9 inside the second belly x 150 cm and reached a maximum reduction of 9 6 inside the third belly near the cod end x 175 cm the flow velocity fields obtained in the numerical simulation were basically consistent with the experimental results for both numerical simulation and experimental results the velocity reduction observed along the centerline inside the trawl net showed that the velocity fluctuation was caused by the discrete distribution of the mesh size and the motion of the trawl net it is worth noting that disturbances of near structure flow in this centerline inside the trawl net were related to the development of turbulent flow this turbulent flow is the boundary layer which is shown directly by the velocity field values the relative error between the numerical simulation and experimental results was about 2 11 indicating that the fluid structure interaction based on two way coupling is effective for calculating the flow velocity variation around trawl net fig 12 shows the experimentally measured velocity contours inside fig 12a and around fig 12b the trawl net the black line indicates the position of bottom trawl net structure the velocity reductions inside and around the trawl net structure can be clearly seen the closer the distance to the cod end and to the structure the lower the velocity distributions this was possibly due to the fact that the mesh size was very small thus limiting the passage of the flow when the flow velocity was 0 68 m s the velocity distributions were higher inside the trawl from the wings to the first belly part compared to other parts of the trawl net the mean velocity measured inside the trawl net was u x 0 48 0 05 m s and 0 61 0 04 m s when the input streamwise velocity was 0 57 m s and 0 68 m s around the trawl net the velocity fields were divided into three main zones low velocity zone 0 3 u 0 0 66 u 0 medium velocity zone 0 66 u 0 0 8 u 0 and high velocity zone 0 8 u 0 0 92 u 0 fig 13 shows the velocity contours of the numerical simulation around the bottom trawl net at velocity magnitude of 0 68 m s the results of x y plan front view and x z plan top view are all shown through the velocity there was a large region of velocity reduction around and downstream of the bottom trawl net the velocity profiles highlight velocity deficits corresponding to the wakes astern of the trawl and the turbulent character of flow around the trawl net fig 13a and a these velocity deficits are due to the development of the turbulent boundary layer flow around the vicinity of the trawl structure and the presence of the vortex shedding in the wake downstream of the bottom trawl net fig 13 it can be observed that the velocity distribution around the trawl net calculated numerically was also divided into three zones low velocity zone 0 25 u 0 0 55 u 0 medium velocity zone 0 55 u 0 0 87 u 0 and high velocity zone 0 8 7 u 0 0 97 u 0 regardless of the normalizing flow fields the thickening of the velocity deficit areas along the structure was notable fig 13c these deficit zones evolved along the different parts of the trawl and more clearly around the trawl body and cod end in addition the flow field also changed according to the mesh opening because the small mesh openings on the trawl body and cod end restricted the flow passage and created a large velocity deficit zone in these parts fig 13c fig 13 also shows the velocity distribution on the vortex core region of the trawl net thus the flow velocity field was greater on the trawl bridle and on the top side of trawl square and trawl body fig 13 a greater difference was observed between the velocity contours obtained numerically and experimentally the experimental and numerical results clearly show that the reduction of flow velocity corresponded to the turbulent boundary layer development around the trawl net structure 3 3 effects of current twine diameter and mesh size on the trawl net structure configuration to quantify the effects of twine diameter mesh size and twine materials on the configuration of the bottom trawl net the total deformation equivalent stress and equivalent elastic strain of different trawl nets were analyzed the configuration of the trawl net structure was mainly evaluated from such aspects as net opening height equivalent stress and equivalent elastic deformation the net mouth height was calculated as the sum of headline height and displacement for each flow velocity the results were compared with flume tank experimental data as shown in fig 14 a it can be observed that the numerical results agreed well with the experimental data according to the numerical simulation and experimental results the net mouth height decreased with the increase in flow velocity at the slowest flow velocity 0 57 m s the net mouth heights of the three model trawl nets were greater than 0 4 m at the highest flow velocity 1 02 m s the net mouth height of both trawl net 1 and trawl net 2 was greater than 0 25 m and that of trawl net 3 was lower than 0 25 m in both the flume tank experimental study and the numerical simulation these results also show that the increase in mesh size and the decrease in twine diameter did not have a great effect on the net opening height fig 14b gives the relative error of net mouth height between numerical simulation results and flume tank experimental results the calculated values of net mouth height of trawl nets 1 and 3 by numerical simulation were significantly lower by 1 16 and 1 53 for trawl nets 1 and 2 respectively than the experimental values p 0 001 glm while that of trawl net 3 was lower than the experimental value by 2 15 table 3 the maximum relative error was 3 86 at 0 8 m s 4 42 at 0 57 m s and 4 82 at 0 8 m s for trawl nets 1 2 and 3 respectively the average net mouth height data are presented in table 6 fig 15 shows that the netting deformation distribution was mainly concentrated at the bottom of the netting therefore the netting experienced greater deformation at its bottom compared to its other parts because the top side of the netting was fixed the total deformation of nylon netting panel solidity ratio equal to 0 027 was greater than that of both dyneema solidity ratio equal to 0 029 and polyethylene solidity ratio equal to 0 071 netting panels one can see that the deformation distribution increased as the mesh size increased and twine diameter decreased fig 15 the calculated equivalent stress and equivalent elastic strain of the model trawl net are shown in fig 16 the equivalent stress and the equivalent elastic strain increased significantly with increase in flow velocity and mesh size and decrease in twine diameter it can be observed that the equivalent stress increased with the increase in equivalent strain the results followed the linear elastic theory because the young s modulus of each material was constant in the whole analysis obeying the hooke s law it should be noted that the equivalent stress of both model trawl nets 2 and 3 was much higher than that of trawl net 1 the equivalent elastic strain of trawl net 3 was much greater than those of trawl nets 1 and 2 also the equivalent stress of model trawl nets 2 and 3 was 61 greater than that of trawl net 1 therefore the decrease in twine diameter using nylon monofilament material and the increase in mesh size using dyneema material led to the increase in equivalent stress and equivalent elastic strain the total deformation represents the maximum value among all the time steps of each point along the trawl net the total deformation values increased with the increase in flow velocity fig 17 thus trawl net 1 was the model with lower mesh size and greater twine diameter its total deformation was 31 and 49 lower than that of trawl nets 2 and 3 respectively 4 discussion during the last few decades the main problem in bottom trawl fishery is the decline in fishery resources and the increase in fuel price thus bottom trawl optimization is necessary to make it more selective less destructive and hydrodynamically efficient this involves reducing the drag force of the bottom trawl to reduce fuel consumption while increasing its sweeping area according to the results of this study the use of numerical simulation considering the fluid structure interaction model and experimental flume test provides valuable knowledge regarding the hydrodynamic forces flow fields and their use in predicting the engineering performance of bottom trawl net the influence of twine diameter mesh size and twine material on the drag force and trawl deformation was demonstrated herein which in turn can influence the geometric performance of the trawl net tang et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 sala et al 2007 based on the results obtained in the present study and those obtained in the previous studies by khaled and priour 2010 balash 2012 sterling 2005 bi et al 2014a 2014b tang et al 2017 and chen and yao 2019 it is evident that the flume tank experimental study and numerical simulation are efficient methods for evaluating the performance of bottom trawl it was also found that the flume tank experimental study is better in terms of precision and the numerical simulation study is better in terms of cost regarding the hydrodynamic performance of the bottom trawl both numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrated good agreement in predicting the hydrodynamic force of trawl net different from the investigations of khaled and priour 2010 tang et al 2017 and wan et al 2019 this study showed that the changes in twine materials twine diameter and mesh size can strongly affect hydrodynamic performance of bottom trawl net by using cfd method as well as a combination of cfd method and large deformation nonlinear structural finite element method in two way coupling indeed the results obtained both experimentally and numerically in the present study showed that the use of nylon monofilament trawl net 3 with twine diameters 61 48 and 54 81 lower than that of trawl nets 1 and 2 respectively led to the corresponding decrease in drag force by 57 42 and 2 84 respectively this trend was confirmed by the experimental studies carried out by wray 2001 ward et al 2005 and kim et al 2007 which showed that the drag force of trawl net decreased as the twine diameter decreased leading to decrease in fuel consumption the present study also demonstrated that the use of dyneema with mesh size 52 22 and 50 56 greater than that of trawl nets 1 and 3 respectively led to 54 58 decrease in drag force this trend was consistent with the studies of wileman and hansen 1988 verhulst and jochems 1993 and balash and sterling 2012 which demonstrated that the increase in mesh size and the use of dyneema material can significantly decrease the drag force of trawl net the modification of the trawl in the present study reduced the drag force by 26 and 31 which is better than the results of sala et al 2008 who increased mesh size and used a strong twine material and wileman and hansen 1988 who used dyneema and also increased the mesh size respectively the simulated results of the bottom trawl hydrodynamic performance were close to the experimental results from the flume tank the average relative errors between drag forces from flume tank model tests and numerical simulations were about 1 71 2 07 and 1 67 for the trawl nets 1 2 and 3 respectively the differences between the numerical and experimental results can arise from the following sources which were difficult to avoid and control the uniformity of input velocity in the flume tank the error caused by the differences between the real net twine used in the flume tank and the cylinders used in the numerical study the setting of the trawl net structure and the measurement error of instruments wan et al 2019 the particularity of this numerical model is that it combines the fluid and solid solvers in two way coupling therefore it takes into account the deformation of trawl net and the flow fields during calculation of the hydrodynamic forces consequently the results of the present study improved upon the results obtained by tang et al 2017 and chen and yao 2019 who used one way fluid structure interaction fsi coupling method and hybrid volume method respectively the relative errors in drag force obtained in the present numerical model were 4 1 12 5 and 20 lower than those obtained in the studies of tang et al 2017 chen and yao 2019 chen and christensen 2016 and patursson et al 2010 respectively this discrepancy could be due to the difference in methods used in these studies in numerical setup experimental setup and the different factors considered in the simulation however it can be concluded that the fsi two way coupling method including sst k ω turbulent model with low reynolds number gives acceptable results compared to the fsi one way coupling method used by tang et al 2017 and the combination of porous media model and lumped mass model in two way coupling used by chen and christensen 2017 although the flume tank experimental study and the numerical simulation produced acceptable results and allowed the prediction of hydrodynamic performance in full scale some factors such as oceanographic conditions wind current swell etc were not taken into account in the simulation and flume tank experiment with regard to the flow velocity field inside and around the bottom trawl net the present study and previous studies by kim 2012 2013 pichot et al 2009 bouhoubeiny et al 2014 and druault et al 2015 demonstrated that the flow developing inside and around the bottom trawl is turbulent and particularly of the boundary layer type and the turbulence is due to the trawl wake it is clear that the development of this turbulent flow has an impact on drag force and fish behavior and therefore affects the bottom trawl net selectivity indeed according to the studies of kim 2013 and bi et al 2017 the velocity reduction around fishing net decreased as the mesh opening increased and the twine diameter decreased this lower flow velocity reduction and the large passage of flow through the mesh opening decreased the hydrodynamic force and made the trawl more selective pichot et al 2009 bouhoubeiny 2012 when the flow velocity was great 0 68 m s the mesh structure rose to its highest amplitude the spatial extent of the outer and internal turbulence flow was greater than that of the bottom trawl net structure when the flow velocity was low 0 57 m s this hypothesis was also evoked by bouhoubeiny 2012 the present study demonstrated that the higher velocity reduction was due to the hindrance of the mesh opening and twine diameter on the passage of the flow bouhoubeiny 2012 the turbulent stress characteristics in the wake region central line of a bottom trawl are close to that of a cylinder or sphere djeridi et al 2003 govardhan et al 2005 thus the velocity reductions around and inside the trawl were higher than those obtained by pichot 2007 and bouhoubeiny et al 2014 in their studies of the flow characteristics around the trawl net structure this difference was likely due to the measurement method used the type of structure used and the experimental conditions for both the measurements from the flume tank test using the adv method and calculated values using numerical simulation the maximum velocity reduction inside the trawl net near the cod end was 18 in contrast according to the results obtained by vincent 1996 and theret 1998 the measured velocity inside the bottom trawl net and near the cod end was close to the trawling speed this difference between our results and the previous work could be due to the fact that the present flow measurement was very limited thus it would be advisable to carry out more flow velocity field measurements in this study trawl net 2 was designed to show the effect of increasing the mesh size and trawl net 3 was designed to show the effect of decreasing the twine diameter on the trawl net configuration and the hydrodynamic performances the results showed that decreasing the twine diameter and increasing the mesh size significantly increased the vertical and horizontal deformations of the bottom trawl net and decreased its drag force according to the results obtained by tang et al 2017 and the results of the present study the net mouth heights obtained experimentally were greater than those obtained by numerical simulation for trawl nets 1 and 2 in contrast for trawl net 3 the numerical simulation results were greater than those obtained experimentally in the flume tank using dynami t software nguyen et al 2015 found that the net mouth height value obtained in numerical simulation was lower than that obtained in the flume tank experiment this discrepancy can be due to the differences in the simulation software used the method used the simulation conditions and the trawl design fiorentini et al 2004 by comparing the structural deformation numerical results it was evident that there was a very large difference between these trawl net models note that trawl net 3 was the model with the greatest equivalent stress equivalent elastic strain and total deformation compared to the other model trawl nets indeed the deformation of fishing gear with the bending stiffness is affected by many factors such as the elasticity of the twine material the twine diameter the mesh size the material density and initial deformations of fishing gear flexibility gansel et al 2013 o neill 2002 priour 1999a 2009 equivalent stress equivalent elastic strain net mouth height and total deformation vary based on the material twine diameter and mesh size therefore estimates of these parameters are very useful in the quantitative analysis of resistance and deformation of a bottom trawl net during the interaction between the fluid fishing gear and the fish and also in the hydrodynamic efficiency and selectivity of the trawl net o neill 1999 priour 1999a sala et al 2007 tang et al 2017 the methods presented here are useful for investigating the effect of twine diameter and mesh size on bottom trawl deformation and can be used for trawl nets with similar characteristics scientifically understanding and documenting the performance of trawls in the fishing industry development and application of numerical modelling in the design and efficiency improvement of fishing gear and study of the turbulent flow development inside and around fishing gear are all important research areas however further efforts are still required to address outstanding issues therefore future work will be focused on a further testing of bottom trawl net models using more twine materials decreasing twine diameter increasing mesh size and combining changes in twine diameter and mesh size which will create a more powerful set of data to robustly define the efficiency of trawl net and reduce fuel consumption b variations in the flow velocity field inside and around the different parts of the trawl net for more realistic and reliable calculation of the hydrodynamic drag however it is advisable to collect an experimental database on the velocity field inside and around the fishing gear with more reliable methods such as the particle image velocimetry method piv and laser doppler velocimetry method ldv for flow measurements inside and around the different parts of trawl net these measurements will make it possible to precisely characterize the flows developing inside and around the trawl net thus facilitating the study of its impact on the hydrodynamic performances and the selectivity of this fishing gear in order to improve the numerical tools software for the simulation of fishing gear the characteristics of the flow obtained experimentally are very important and should be considered 5 conclusion the effects of twine diameter mesh size and twine material on the hydrodynamic performance of flow fields around the trawl net were experimentally and numerically investigated the proposed numerical model for simulating the interaction between flow and flexible trawl net structure was based on fsi with two way coupling in the numerical model rans model in conjunction with the k ω sst model was solved by the finite volume method and was applied to describe the flow field around the trawl net the large deformation non linear structural finite element method was applied to describe the deformation of the trawl net structure and to capture the knots displacement the hydrodynamic forces of flow fields around the bottom trawl net were evaluated through numerical simulation and experiments the following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this work 1 the proposed fsi method in this study can integrate the effect of node displacement on the flow field around the trawl and integrate the effect of the structure flow field on the mesh deformation also the geometric shapes used for the flow simulation and the structure mechanics are independent of each other these characteristics make the fsi two way coupling especially suitable for fluid structure coupling analysis of meshes with large deformation 2 the relative error between the numerical model data and the experimental data was less than 2 1 4 5 and 2 4 respectively for hydrodynamic forces net mouth height and velocity fields inside and around the bottom trawl net therefore this method is suitable to simulate the flow around the trawl net calculate the drag forces of trawl net and quantify the deformation of the trawl net 3 when the flow velocity was very high the mesh structure rose to its highest amplitude the spatial extent of the outer and internal turbulence flow was greater than that of the bottom trawl net structure when the flow velocity was low also the velocity reduction measurements carried out experimentally in the flume tank test using the adv method inside the trawl net were about 18 5 and 16 less than those at lower 0 57 m s and higher 0 68 m s flow velocity respectively 4 the equivalent stress equivalent elastic strain and total deformation were greatly influenced by flow velocity twine diameter and mesh size their values increased with increasing flow velocity increasing mesh size and decreasing twine diameter 5 the use of high strength materials such as nylon monofilament and dyneema resulted in lower drag force on the bottom trawl structure thus it would be beneficial to select one of the two for trawl design 6 the results obtained in the flow field measurements can have direct applications in the implementation of numerical software for fishing gear design which can improve fishing gear mechanics using numerical simulation in china in particular post processing and analysis of the different databases will allow validation of numerical simulations and also provide data to initialize the calculations of hydrodynamic forces credit authorship contribution statement bruno thierry nyatchouba nsangue investigation methodology software writing original draft data curation conceptualization

20632,accurate prediction of sea level fluctuations is fundamental to coastal engineering however limited monitoring service on a regional scale is the most important constraint in analyzing identifying or predicting sea level fluctuations driven with several nonlinearly integrated deterministic processes the present study investigates the prediction performance of machine learning ml

future sea level has great importance in the planning and implementation stages of marine projects which are related to different issues such as environmental pollution maderich and konstantinov 2002 coastal management pethick 2001 transportation whittington 2016 renewable energy aboobacker 2017 and sub marine structures oda et al 2009 additionally sea level records can be utilized as a reference parameter in strait hydrodynamic modeling because surface water movement is the major operational factor that drives the coastal sea dynamics cucco et al 2016 concerns about local sea level rise and the potential impact of extreme events on coastal areas have increased the necessity of the development of the level of knowledge worldwide pachauri and reisinger 2007 however the prediction of the future sea level for a short lead time is still limited due to the lack of in situ records anderson 2013 hil 2020 generation of site specific information depending on the analysis of the cumulative consequence of the multiple synergic effects on a marine system needs long term monitoring and a compact measurement network erol 2011 yet economic and technical impossibilities can limit the number of tide gauge stations and their service life joseph 2014 the absence of sufficient data encourages modeling based on information transfer obtained from one dataset to another for filling data gaps in a particular study area huang et al 2003 chang and lin 2006 designed a neural network model to predict harmonic sea level components that depend on astronomical tide generating forces and extended the simulation to obtain future tides at six neighboring points to the location where the model is trained zhu et al 2020 transferred water level fluctuation memory compiled with neural network and deep learning methods from records of multiple lakes in a region to water level prediction models of each lake in the region the high potential of artificial intelligence based mathematical approaches in perceiving complex patterns and making rational decisions has brought them among the acceptable real world prediction methods the machine learning ml approach is a type of artificial intelligence ai technique that designs and develops processes based on algorithms that enable computers to learn from data the main benefit of these prediction methods is that they infer stochastic dependency

effect that contribute to sea level changes in the frequency domain however due to concerns about the loss of information resulting from the steady state assumption of classical methods that obscure

2016 the primary purpose of this study is to develop a predictive mathematical model to identify spatial and temporal relations in sea level time series that are collected through the bosphorus besides a developed methodology using alternative model structures serves the second aim of the present study which is to investigate the contribution and effects of pre processing and their impact on the prediction accuracy of machine learning methods a further objective of this study is to be able to predict the sea levels at any stations with developed models via one of the station data located in the bosphorus past studies have been focused on lead time prediction in a certain station with train and test components derived from a single data set of the station which is used for learning and testing purposes respectively in this study developed models are evaluated employing a non dimensional metric nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse and a classic error metric root mean squared error rmse the proposed modeling approach based on the transfer of existing system information to new situations is considered to be of practical benefit especially in regions where there are limited available or missing data 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data as the only waterway of the black sea to marmara and thereby the mediterranean sea is bosphorus it has crucial importance not only for local but also for international oceanographic projects myers et al 2003 how the vertical and horizontal movements of the water in the region influence the hydrodynamic behavior of bosphorus and connected oceanographic systems is still a current interest and topic of ongoing researches altunkaynak and kartal 2019 hossain and meng 2020 though several bosphorus sea level measurements have been obtained at different points during different periods in the scope of the local or global projects the absence of a widespread measurement network in the region is still a limiting factor in studies examining the water mobility in the strait however the oceanographic data pool generated with the contribution of some limited records collected in intermittent intervals within the scope of large projects in the bosphorus can be utilized as an important source in the generation of new local information if properly processed this study offers a methodology that can be used to transfer the knowledge acquired with trained models with the available records in the bosphorus to the sea level lead time prediction models to be simulated at another location and time three different data sets were used to transmit the information along the bosphorus fig 1 daily sea level data used in this study were initially observed in 2003 at n1 station located near the north entrance of bosphorus and in 2005 at n2 and s2 stations at the north entrance and south entrance of bosphorus the n1 n2 and s2 stations yearlong data sets have daily time scales the developed models are calibrated individually with n2 station data and then validated with data of n1 and s2 stations the same training and validation procedure is carried out circularly for all the stations n1 n2 and s2 the methodology presented in this study heavily relies on the accurate development of mathematical expressions that are able to represent non linear stochastic relationships between sea level time series via machine learning regression methods i e support vector machine svm k nearest neighbor knn and decision tree dt effective data preparation is central to improve the accuracy and the computational efficiency of prediction models predictive methods are supported by wavelet decomposition and standardization pre processing techniques to enhance the representative ability of learned knowledge in different situations the performance of machine learning methods is determined by evaluating their estimation skills on new data sets 2 2 standardization the methodological innovation presented in this study provides the opportunity of transferring information between different data sets however information transfer is only possible when data sets can be defined within the same solution range especially knn and svm regression methods generate new data by interpolation of learned data by implementing standardization pre process scale consistency is eliminated between trained and tested time series as well as common fluctuation information is revealed the prediction methodology used in this study explained later in detail enables to obtain sea level heights at any point through the strait based on the average and standard deviation values of the measurement in the past sea level time series data obtained from three stations n1 n2 and s2 are normalized that is the mean value of each time series is subtracted from itself and subsequently each time series is divided by its standard deviation 2 3 wavelet transform the wavelet transform is a filtering technique that is widely utilized for multi component non stationary time series analysis wavelet analysis which is based on fourier windowing provides simple subseries of data to analyze the time series more easily via extracting time frequency knowledge embedded into complex time series in different resolution stages the main purpose of the decomposition is to produce more homogenous sub series data in cases where many non stationary component effects persist periods of prediction methods vary over a wide time interval constructing past future connections in a series of overlapping time series fails in such circumstances more homogeneous sub components are useful in the analysis and prediction phase altunkaynak 2014 altunkaynak and ozger 2016 in the classical sea level decomposing technique harmonic analysis is preferred as an astronomic tidal component separator tool however it is inadequate to indicate underlying other components that generate the signal gan et al 2019 wavelet decomposition with scaling and stretching wavelet scale stands out as a powerful analysis tool altunkaynak 2019 özger et al 2020 wavelet algorithm that uses low pass and high pass filters to decompose original time series data into approximation and details bands mallat 1989 each decomposed sub band offers unique meaningful information at different resolution levels 1 a i t n h n a i t 2 i n 2 a i t n a i 1 t a i t while approximation bands a i t indicate slow variations in time scale such as trend cycle or seasonality detailed information embedded in the original time series data can be examined by detail bands d i t 3 y h i g h k t 0 n 1 x t g 2 k t y l o w k t 0 n 1 x t h 2 k t time series x t is simultaneously separated into two components in k steps by a pair of filters y h i g h k and y l o w k which are related to each other with the quadrature mirror property in favor of the conjugate mirror filters sub bands sub series are superimposed to produce input data at the previous decomposition level modeling procedures are implemented for each sub band individually and the final prediction is obtained by the superposition of the prediction of each sub band 2 4 k nearest neighbor the k nearest neighbor knn method defines the connections between the past and the future values over similarity relationships it is a machine learning algorithm that stands out with its easy applicability feature fix 1951 proposed knn as a non parametric machine learning method and it is further developed with the later contributions of hellman 1970 in knn applications new observation is associated with most similar observed samples according to the distance between data points the most general expression of distance measurement is minkowski distance 4 d x 1 x 2 2 y 1 y 2 2 in this metric distance d between two points x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 are defined in the euclidean spaces the number of closest samples to be evaluated in the classification or estimation is denoted by k which is a positive integer choosing the optimal number of neighbors that will affect the estimation results is of great importance for the model s successful performance in this study cross validation is used to optimize the value of k 2 5 support vector machines support vector machine svm is a statistical learning method that prioritizes the balance between error minimization and generalization capacity frunza 2016 it was originally developed to solve pattern classification problems but later found widespread use in myriad scientific applications such as function estimation regression signal processing and time series estimation problems cortes and vapnik 1995 svm provides a general solution by expressing complex processes with a decision hyperplane that is determined based on a small piece of data named as support vectors the formula for estimator function is 5 f x w t x b where w weight vector is the hyperplane normal the distance of the hyperplane from the origin is b bias and x is the vector of data points the optimal solution can be expressed with a constrained condition as following 6 m i n w 2 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i s t y i w t x i b 1 ξ i 0 y i w t x b 1 ξ i 0 herein x i and y i are the coordinates ξ i and ξ i are the loss parameters w t is the transpose of the weight vector c is the penalty factor that balances the complexity then the duality problem is introduced by applying karush kuhn tucker conditions as follows 7 m a x l d α i 1 n α i 1 2 i j 1 n y i y j α i α j x i j x j α i 0 i 1 n α i y i 0 l d function is maximized based on the non zero values of the dual variable α i that correspond to the support vectors in nonlinear problems kernel functions can be used to map input data to a high dimensional feature domain where the linear solution is possible radial basis function rbf is a popular kernel function which is given by the formula 8 k x i x j exp x i x j x i x j 2 γ 0 where k is the rbf kernel function x i and x j are the feature vectors γ is the parameter of the bell shaped curve the final form of the optimization problem in terms of lagrange multipliers is as follows 9 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 γ 0 svm can be obtained through adjustable parameters c γ ε the cross validation technique is used to determine the optimum parameter combination among many alternatives that could represent the problem under consideration 2 6 decision tree the tree based modeling approaches work by recursively splitting a training sample and searching for a sub group of specific solutions that can successively relate inputs with outputs the critical point in a successful partitioning process is that the homogeneity of sub groups allows them to be represented by a single mathematical expression in the classification and regression tree cart a classical branching technique designed by breiman et al 1984 learns consistently in deciding node points decision points that present conditionally splitting threshold values of predictor variables based on their directional influence on the predicted values by using the gini index gi 10 g i 1 i 1 m p i 2 where p i is the prediction error in each i class and m is the number of nodes while high node numbers contributing to the homogenization it becomes more difficult to adapt the learned expression to the new conditions to balance between generalization and overfitting the number of nodes is optimized with cross validation 2 7 evaluation criteria in this study the predictive ability of machine learning ml models is compared with utilizing classical performance indicators which are root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency criteria nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 rmse quadratically scores the difference between prediction value y pi and corresponding observation data y oi a decrease in rmse value obtained in the same unit as the observation measures the improvement in model performance 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n y pi y oi 2 the nse value is further utilized to evaluate the model performance a dimensionless metric nse is the ratio of prediction error residual variance to the observation variance that spans the range 1 a nse value of 1 implies a perfect model and models with nse value relatively close to 1 is relatively close to being a perfect model therefore for a model to be accurate the residual variance must be significantly smaller than the variance of dependable variable observed data if the residual variance is significantly greater than observed data variance then this implies that the model is unacceptable it can be defined as 12 nse 1 i 1 n y pi y oi 2 i 1 n y oi y o 2 the nse value is utilized to evaluate the model performance according to moriasi et al 2015 if nse value of a model is greater than 0 5 an acceptable success level 3 results and discussion 3 1 model structure development in complex system modeling determining modeling strategy and designing an appropriate model structure are foundational to enhance the efficiency of machine learning since sea level fluctuations are the cumulative responses to many hydrodynamic mechanisms varying in a wide frequency range decomposition of sea level data into its different components embedded into sea level time series is the advised methodology in the literature to extract meaningful information cheng et al 2017 löfgren et al 2014 in this study model structure optimization is achieved using mlr to assess the impact of input number decomposition and standardization on model performance the sea level time series data are gradually separated into sub series spectral bands by a special form of discrete wavelet transform mallat 1989 to produce homogeneous data of inputs for mlr models after filtering with the haar3 mother wavelet function time series data are decomposed into four 4 sub series namely 3 detail bands d1 d2 d3 and 1 approximation a band the data is further pre processed so that sea level time series data are standardized with zero 0 mean and unit 1 variance the effects of data pre processing standardization and decomposition and the number of inputs on multilinear regression mlr model predictions are evaluated under 6 different model structures which are summarized in fig 2 with an input based classification model alternatives can be collected in 3 categories firstly time series prediction based on past time series m1 m2 secondly time series prediction from composed bands based on past band values in a specific resolution level m3 m4 and finally times series prediction based on their all band components in different resolution levels m5 m6 in general terms all models except m1 and m2 are designed with decomposed sub samples of times series instead of original data forms while time series inputs serve overall time patterns to prediction methods band inputs serve simpler and more homogenous time scale patterns in different resolution levels to view model sensitivity from input number standpoint m2 m4 and m6 are designed via adding the previous value t 1 to the models m1 m3 m5 respectively which use time information obtained from the last available current value t in the present study predictive models are developed in predicting daily sea levels for lead times from 1 up to 7 days lead time is described as time steps time interval between predictor sea level value and occurrence of predicted sea level value data recorded during 12 months at the n2 station is used to establish the best architecture of the model subsequently developed models are calibrated trained with n2 station data and used in predicting sea levels in the bosphorus strait at the locations of n1 and s2 stations prediction performance of mlr models for stations as n1 and s2 are given in table 1 all developed model structures are tested with both original unstandardized and standardized data for lead times up to 7 days depending on the findings of the preliminary investigation it is clear that when the time series data are decomposed into simpler sub series sub bands models with wavelet m3 m4 m5 m6 strongly correlate past and future values first nonstationary time series involve many components with different periods that vary over a wide time interval prediction methods fail to construct an apparent relationship between past values and future value and thus more homogeneous sub series are useful for the analysis and prediction phase secondly standardization is necessary to define various data collected at different periods and or locations in the same solution additionally by eliminating periodicity and trend cycles from original data standardization contributes the accurate prediction results thirdly using sub series band t 1 and band t in the same spectral energy level obtained by individual decomposition of two previous values as are used as inputs into the model to enhance the prediction accuracy of sea level data by hybrid wavelet mlr models however m3 and m5 models with single input one band and m4 and m6 models with two inputs two bands are compared by considering the superposition stage via using all spectral bands in one model or superposition it is found that more than one individual band has no significant effect on the prediction results according to the various tested model structures m4 band models supported with standardization and decomposition provided the most accurate prediction results this distinguished model structure in linear modeling is adapted into machine learning regression models to accurately predict the sea level fluctuations for extended lead times 3 2 machine learning regression prediction models a methodology based on machine learning analysis enhanced by data preprocessing using wavelet decomposition has been developed to transfer sea level learning between stations in the bosphorus strait ml models predict the daily sea level extended lead times up to 7 days standardized and decomposed data are used as inputs into the machine learning predictor models to obtain daily sea level data in spatially different stations n1 n2 and s2 or different periods the accuracy of the models is quantified in terms of rmse and nse indicator criteria the performance of machine learning models which are trained by observed sea level data of n2 and tested predicted with s2 and n1 observed sea level data are evaluated according to criteria values given in table 2 daily sea level predictions of s2 southern station and n1 northern station follow the same measurement period and same location with n2 respectively in s2 predictor models which are trained and tested with the data observed in the same period but spatially different points k nearest neighbor knn and support vector machine svm performed closely with nse value around 0 90 while decision tree dt model resulted in nse value 0 78 was less successful for 1 day lead time prediction due to the decreasing correlation with lags the performance of all models reduces however svm models become more stable compared to other ml regression models for example the rmse value of dt models reaches up to 194 cm while knn and svm are more successful with the rmse values of 172 cm and 152 cm respectively by considering the acceptable limit of nse value of 0 5 in a study moriasi et al 2015 that involves a methodology with criteria based evaluations knn svm and dt models are not generated accurate predictions for lead times exceed 5 6 and 2 respectively for discussed data set results of ml regression models trained with n2 station s data and predicted tested sea level data of n1 station given on the right side of table 2 indicate the performance of ml models on transferring sea level information between data sets recorded different dates as a predictive error indicator rmse values of knn svm and dt models are found as 5 4 cm 8 cm and 12 cm respectively high accuracy of with knn in one day lead time nse 0 95 reduces as the time step increases yet an acceptable level even in seven day lead time is achieved nse 0 59 following the knn model svm provides accurate predictions for up to 6 days on the contrary its inefficacy to establish a strong connection between past and future values keeps dt from offering acceptable predictions from 4 up to 7 days the general evaluation of model sensitivity to data characteristics reveals that the methods were more successful in the information transfer between spatially close stations than periodically temporally close stations the performance of developed machine learning models based on the data recorded at the s2 station located at the southern of bosphorus is tested with data sets recorded observed sea level data sets at two northern stations n1 and n2 in different periods prediction accuracy of the models calibrated with s2 station data is used to predict daily sea level data of n1 and n2 stations is evaluated by rmse and nse values given in table 3 calculated rmse values of ml models at n2 for one day lead time prediction indicates the high performance of knn and svm methods at transferring information between two different stations data which are simultaneously recorded dt model is partly behind these two methods with rmse and nse values of 19 cm and 0 88 respectively while prediction performances of all models decrease with increasing time step between the input and predicted values the relative success of the methods remains almost the same for all lead times considering that the limit of nse value is 0 5 knn and svm models have acceptable accuracy up to 5 days however the mathematical function designed by the dt model is not sufficient to define relations between sea level components that exceed the lead time of 3 days according to the results of the models in terms of n1 data for one day lead time it can be stated that ml methods had high performance even in cases in which the predictor function was designed and tested with periodically and locally different conditions the nse value of knn svm and dt models that are trained by the data of the s2 station and predicted sea level observations of the n1 station are found to be 0 96 0 96 and 0 87 respectively for one day lead time as the lead time increases equality between svm and knn models is broken down in favor of the knn model for lead time predictions up to 3 days all developed models can generate acceptable prediction results based on the past sea level data according to the accuracy limit of nse given as 0 5 in the literature moriasi et al 2015 only knn provides acceptable results for four days lead time predictions when the lead time of four days is exceeded all developed models are insufficient for accurate prediction of sea level in bosphorus additionally to practically compare the performances of ml regression models in different locations and periods the nse values for each lead time are given with column graphs which are embedded in fig 3 graphs illustrate the sensitivity of the models to the conditions that change between training and testing data such as location difference measurement period difference and both measurement period and location difference in the model set illustrated in fig 3b for each prediction lead time the results within the acceptable limits are available and all nse values are positive it can be stated that location the consistency enhances the prediction performance and predictability period although recorded in different periods sea level data at closely located stations can be represented by a common mathematical expression on the other hand fig 3a and c reveal the performance level of the models with the same measurement periods the exchange in the data being trained and tested during the information transfer between locally different stations does not dramatically affect the results fig 3d demonstrates the relatively poor prediction performance of ml regression methods on locally and periodically different data which implies the impossibility of obtaining sea level time series after 3 days according to numerical results and visual inspections the dt model has the worst performance in predicting time series sea level data compared to knn and svm models for all scenarios and lead times 4 conclusion this study uses the performances of the developed predictive mathematical models in predicting future sea levels in bosphorus from available data that are tested in temporally and spatially different conditions the success of the modeling approach introduced in this study in transferring the learned modeling capabilities between stations located at different regions and or recorded on different dates were evaluated by means of rmse and nse metrics the essential point in transferring information between observed sea level data which have formed in response to different conditions and different statistical properties was to define a common solution space to develop machine learning models based on the generalization and adaptation capabilities with various modeling strategies were established as a result of the model structure optimization research it was determined that data pre processing such as standardization and wavelet decomposition positively contributes to the accuracy of the regression models gradual decomposition of data in different resolution levels is beneficial to the enhancement of a predictive model this distinguished model structure in linear modeling is adapted into machine learning regression models to accurately predict the sea level data for extended lead times up to 7 days it can be stated that location consistency increases the prediction performance and predictability period based on the acceptable success limits defined in terms of performance criteria ml models are able to predict accurately the daily sea level data of stations located at different regions in the bosphorus for all 7 days up to 6 days when recorded with close periods up to 3 days if recorded in different period and location considering the superiority of the estimation method independent of the scenarios svm and knn are generally performed well while dt is performed relatively poorly in transfer modeling information in the bosphorus ml models with high generalization capacity have been developed which can predict for a week ahead in variable conditions the proposed modeling approach based on the transfer of existing system information to new situations especially in regions where there are limited available or missing data are fundamental in scientific and engineering

future sea level has great importance in the planning and implementation stages of marine projects which are related to different issues such as environmental pollution maderich and konstantinov 2002 coastal management pethick 2001 transportation whittington 2016 renewable energy aboobacker 2017 and sub marine structures oda et al 2009 additionally sea level records can be utilized as a reference parameter in strait hydrodynamic modeling because surface water movement is the major operational factor that drives the coastal sea dynamics cucco et al 2016 concerns about local sea level rise and the potential impact of extreme events on coastal areas have increased the necessity of the development of the level of knowledge worldwide pachauri and reisinger 2007 however the prediction of the future sea level for a short lead time is still limited due to the lack of in situ records anderson 2013 hil 2020 generation of site specific information depending on the analysis of the cumulative consequence of the multiple synergic effects on a marine system needs long term monitoring and a compact measurement network erol 2011 yet economic and technical impossibilities can limit the number of tide gauge stations and their service life joseph 2014 the absence of sufficient data encourages modeling based on information transfer obtained from one dataset to another for filling data gaps in a particular study area huang et al 2003 chang and lin 2006 designed a neural network model to predict harmonic sea level components that depend on astronomical tide generating forces and extended the simulation to obtain future tides at six neighboring points to the location where the model is trained zhu et al 2020 transferred water level fluctuation memory compiled with neural network and deep learning methods from records of multiple lakes in a region to water level prediction models of each lake in the region the high potential of artificial intelligence based mathematical approaches in perceiving complex patterns and making rational decisions has brought them among the acceptable real world prediction methods the machine learning ml approach is a type of artificial intelligence ai technique that designs and develops processes based on algorithms that enable computers to learn from data the main benefit of these prediction methods is that they infer stochastic dependency

effect that contribute to sea level changes in the frequency domain however due to concerns about the loss of information resulting from the steady state assumption of classical methods that obscure dynamic changes wavelet has become to be used as a prominent preferred signal processing tool in sea level time series el diasty et al 2018 thanks to its capability in revealing time frequency

2016 the primary purpose of this study is to develop a predictive mathematical model to identify spatial and temporal relations in sea level time series that are collected through the bosphorus besides a developed methodology using alternative model structures serves the second aim of the present study which is to investigate the contribution and effects of pre processing and their impact on the prediction accuracy of machine learning methods a further objective of this study is to be able to predict the sea levels at any stations with developed models via one of the station data located in the bosphorus past studies have been focused on lead time prediction in a certain station with train and test components derived from a single data set of the station which is used for learning and testing purposes respectively in this study developed models are evaluated employing a non dimensional metric nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse and a classic error metric root mean squared error rmse the proposed modeling approach based on the transfer of existing system information to new situations is considered to be of practical benefit especially in regions where there are limited available or missing data 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data as the only waterway of the black sea to marmara and thereby the mediterranean sea is bosphorus it has crucial importance not only for local but also for international oceanographic projects myers et al 2003 how the vertical and horizontal movements of the water in the region influence the hydrodynamic behavior of bosphorus and connected oceanographic systems is still a current interest and topic of ongoing researches altunkaynak and kartal 2019 hossain and meng 2020 though several bosphorus sea level measurements have been obtained at different points during different periods in the scope of the local or global projects the absence of a widespread measurement network in the region is still a limiting factor in studies examining the water mobility in the strait however the oceanographic data pool generated with the contribution of some limited records collected in intermittent intervals within the scope of large projects in the bosphorus can be utilized as an important source in the generation of new local information if properly processed this study offers a methodology that can be used to transfer the knowledge acquired with trained models with the available records in the bosphorus to the sea level lead time prediction models to be simulated at another location and time three different data sets were used to transmit the information along the bosphorus fig 1 daily sea level data used in this study were initially observed in 2003 at n1 station located near the north entrance of bosphorus and in 2005 at n2 and s2 stations at the north entrance and south entrance of bosphorus the n1 n2 and s2 stations yearlong data sets have daily time scales the developed models are calibrated individually with n2 station data and then validated with data of n1 and s2 stations the same training and validation procedure is carried out circularly for all the stations n1 n2 and s2 the methodology presented in this study heavily relies on the accurate development of mathematical expressions that are able to represent non linear stochastic relationships between sea level time series via machine learning regression methods i e support vector machine svm k nearest neighbor knn and decision tree dt effective data preparation is central to improve the accuracy and the computational efficiency of prediction models predictive methods are supported by wavelet decomposition and standardization pre processing techniques to enhance the representative ability of learned knowledge in different situations the performance of machine learning methods is determined by evaluating their estimation skills on new data sets 2 2 standardization the methodological innovation presented in this study provides the opportunity of transferring information between different data sets however information transfer is only possible when data sets can be defined within the same solution range especially knn and svm regression methods generate new data by interpolation of learned data by implementing standardization pre process scale consistency is eliminated between trained and tested time series as well as common fluctuation information is revealed the prediction methodology used in this study explained later in detail enables to obtain sea level heights at any point through the strait based on the average and standard deviation values of the measurement in the past sea level time series data obtained from three stations n1 n2 and s2 are normalized that is the mean value of each time series is subtracted from itself and subsequently each time series is divided by its standard deviation 2 3 wavelet transform the wavelet transform is a filtering technique that is widely utilized for multi component non stationary time series analysis wavelet analysis which is based on fourier windowing provides simple subseries of data to analyze the time series more easily via extracting time frequency knowledge embedded into complex time series in different resolution stages the main purpose of the decomposition is to produce more homogenous sub series data in cases where many non stationary component effects persist periods of prediction methods vary over a wide time interval constructing past future connections in a series of overlapping time series fails in such circumstances more homogeneous sub components are useful in the analysis and prediction phase altunkaynak 2014 altunkaynak and ozger 2016 in the classical sea level decomposing technique harmonic analysis is preferred as an astronomic tidal component separator tool however it is inadequate to indicate underlying other components that generate the signal gan et al 2019 wavelet decomposition with scaling and stretching wavelet scale stands out as a powerful analysis tool altunkaynak 2019 özger et al 2020 wavelet algorithm that uses low pass and high pass filters to decompose original time series data into approximation and details bands mallat 1989 each decomposed sub band offers unique meaningful information at different resolution levels 1 a i t n h n a i t 2 i n 2 a i t n a i 1 t a i t while approximation bands a i t indicate slow variations in time scale such as trend cycle or seasonality detailed information embedded in the original time series data can be examined by detail bands d i t 3 y h i g h k t 0 n 1 x t g 2 k t y l o w k t 0 n 1 x t h 2 k t time series x t is simultaneously separated into two components in k steps by a pair of filters y h i g h k and y l o w k which are related to each other with the quadrature mirror property in favor of the conjugate mirror filters sub bands sub series are superimposed to produce input data at the previous decomposition level modeling procedures are implemented for each sub band individually and the final prediction is obtained by the superposition of the prediction of each sub band 2 4 k nearest neighbor the k nearest neighbor knn method defines the connections between the past and the future values over similarity relationships it is a machine learning algorithm that stands out with its easy applicability feature fix 1951 proposed knn as a non parametric machine learning method and it is further developed with the later contributions of hellman 1970 in knn applications new observation is associated with most similar observed samples according to the distance between data points the most general expression of distance measurement is minkowski distance 4 d x 1 x 2 2 y 1 y 2 2 in this metric distance d between two points x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 are defined in the euclidean spaces the number of closest samples to be evaluated in the classification or estimation is denoted by k which is a positive integer choosing the optimal number of neighbors that will affect the estimation results is of great importance for the model s successful performance in this study cross validation is used to optimize the value of k 2 5 support vector machines support vector machine svm is a statistical learning method that prioritizes the balance between error minimization and generalization capacity frunza 2016 it was originally developed to solve pattern classification problems but later found widespread use in myriad scientific applications such as function estimation regression signal processing and time series estimation problems cortes and vapnik 1995 svm provides a general solution by expressing complex processes with a decision hyperplane that is determined based on a small piece of data named as support vectors the formula for estimator function is 5 f x w t x b where w weight vector is the hyperplane normal the distance of the hyperplane from the origin is b bias and x is the vector of data points the optimal solution can be expressed with a constrained condition as following 6 m i n w 2 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i s t y i w t x i b 1 ξ i 0 y i w t x b 1 ξ i 0 herein x i and y i are the coordinates ξ i and ξ i are the loss parameters w t is the transpose of the weight vector c is the penalty factor that balances the complexity then the duality problem is introduced by applying karush kuhn tucker conditions as follows 7 m a x l d α i 1 n α i 1 2 i j 1 n y i y j α i α j x i j x j α i 0 i 1 n α i y i 0 l d function is maximized based on the non zero values of the dual variable α i that correspond to the support vectors in nonlinear problems kernel functions can be used to map input data to a high dimensional feature domain where the linear solution is possible radial basis function rbf is a popular kernel function which is given by the formula 8 k x i x j exp x i x j x i x j 2 γ 0 where k is the rbf kernel function x i and x j are the feature vectors γ is the parameter of the bell shaped curve the final form of the optimization problem in terms of lagrange multipliers is as follows 9 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 γ 0 svm can be obtained through adjustable parameters c γ ε the cross validation technique is used to determine the optimum parameter combination among many alternatives that could represent the problem under consideration 2 6 decision tree the tree based modeling approaches work by recursively splitting a training sample and searching for a sub group of specific solutions that can successively relate inputs with outputs the critical point in a successful partitioning process is that the homogeneity of sub groups allows them to be represented by a single mathematical expression in the classification and regression tree cart a classical branching technique designed by breiman et al 1984 learns consistently in deciding node points decision points that present conditionally splitting threshold values of predictor variables based on their directional influence on the predicted values by using the gini index gi 10 g i 1 i 1 m p i 2 where p i is the prediction error in each i class and m is the number of nodes while high node numbers contributing to the homogenization it becomes more difficult to adapt the learned expression to the new conditions to balance between generalization and overfitting the number of nodes is optimized with cross validation 2 7 evaluation criteria in this study the predictive ability of machine learning ml models is compared with utilizing classical performance indicators which are root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency criteria nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 rmse quadratically scores the difference between prediction value y pi and corresponding observation data y oi a decrease in rmse value obtained in the same unit as the observation measures the improvement in model performance 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n y pi y oi 2 the nse value is further utilized to evaluate the model performance a dimensionless metric nse is the ratio of prediction error residual variance to the observation variance that spans the range 1 a nse value of 1 implies a perfect model and models with nse value relatively close to 1 is relatively close to being a perfect model therefore for a model to be accurate the residual variance must be significantly smaller than the variance of dependable variable observed data if the residual variance is significantly greater than observed data variance then this implies that the model is unacceptable it can be defined as 12 nse 1 i 1 n y pi y oi 2 i 1 n y oi y o 2 the nse value is utilized to evaluate the model performance according to moriasi et al 2015 if nse value of a model is greater than 0 5 an acceptable success level 3 results and discussion 3 1 model structure development in complex system modeling determining modeling strategy and designing an appropriate model structure are foundational to enhance the efficiency of machine learning since sea level fluctuations are the cumulative responses to many hydrodynamic mechanisms varying in a wide frequency range decomposition of sea level data into its different components embedded into sea level time series is the advised methodology in the literature to extract meaningful information cheng et al 2017 löfgren et al 2014 in this study model structure optimization is achieved using mlr to assess the impact of input number decomposition and standardization on model performance the sea level time series data are gradually separated into sub series spectral bands by a special form of discrete wavelet transform mallat 1989 to produce homogeneous data of inputs for mlr models after filtering with the haar3 mother wavelet function time series data are decomposed into four 4 sub series namely 3 detail bands d1 d2 d3 and 1 approximation a band the data is further pre processed so that sea level time series data are standardized with zero 0 mean and unit 1 variance the effects of data pre processing standardization and decomposition and the number of inputs on multilinear regression mlr model predictions are evaluated under 6 different model structures which are summarized in fig 2 with an input based classification model alternatives can be collected in 3 categories firstly time series prediction based on past time series m1 m2 secondly time series prediction from composed bands based on past band values in a specific resolution level m3 m4 and finally times series prediction based on their all band components in different resolution levels m5 m6 in general terms all models except m1 and m2 are designed with decomposed sub samples of times series instead of original data forms while time series inputs serve overall time patterns to prediction methods band inputs serve simpler and more homogenous time scale patterns in different resolution levels to view model sensitivity from input number standpoint m2 m4 and m6 are designed via adding the previous value t 1 to the models m1 m3 m5 respectively which use time information obtained from the last available current value t in the present study predictive models are developed in predicting daily sea levels for lead times from 1 up to 7 days lead time is described as time steps time interval between predictor sea level value and occurrence of predicted sea level value data recorded during 12 months at the n2 station is used to establish the best architecture of the model subsequently developed models are calibrated trained with n2 station data and used in predicting sea levels in the bosphorus strait at the locations of n1 and s2 stations prediction performance of mlr models for stations as n1 and s2 are given in table 1 all developed model structures are tested with both original unstandardized and standardized data for lead times up to 7 days depending on the findings of the preliminary investigation it is clear that when the time series data are decomposed into simpler sub series sub bands models with wavelet m3 m4 m5 m6 strongly correlate past and future values first nonstationary time series involve many components with different periods that vary over a wide time interval prediction methods fail to construct an apparent relationship between past values and future value and thus more homogeneous sub series are useful for the analysis and prediction phase secondly standardization is necessary to define various data collected at different periods and or locations in the same solution additionally by eliminating periodicity and trend cycles from original data standardization contributes the accurate prediction results thirdly using sub series band t 1 and band t in the same spectral energy level obtained by individual decomposition of two previous values as are used as inputs into the model to enhance the prediction accuracy of sea level data by hybrid wavelet mlr models however m3 and m5 models with single input one band and m4 and m6 models with two inputs two bands are compared by considering the superposition stage via using all spectral bands in one model or superposition it is found that more than one individual band has no significant effect on the prediction results according to the various tested model structures m4 band models supported with standardization and decomposition provided the most accurate prediction results this distinguished model structure in linear modeling is adapted into machine learning regression models to accurately predict the sea level fluctuations for extended lead times 3 2 machine learning regression prediction models a methodology based on machine learning analysis enhanced by data preprocessing using wavelet decomposition has been developed to transfer sea level learning between stations in the bosphorus strait ml models predict the daily sea level extended lead times up to 7 days standardized and decomposed data are used as inputs into the machine learning predictor models to obtain daily sea level data in spatially different stations n1 n2 and s2 or different periods the accuracy of the models is quantified in terms of rmse and nse indicator criteria the performance of machine learning models which are trained by observed sea level data of n2 and tested predicted with s2 and n1 observed sea level data are evaluated according to criteria values given in table 2 daily sea level predictions of s2 southern station and n1 northern station follow the same measurement period and same location with n2 respectively in s2 predictor models which are trained and tested with the data observed in the same period but spatially different points k nearest neighbor knn and support vector machine svm performed closely with nse value around 0 90 while decision tree dt model resulted in nse value 0 78 was less successful for 1 day lead time prediction due to the decreasing correlation with lags the performance of all models reduces however svm models become more stable compared to other ml regression models for example the rmse value of dt models reaches up to 194 cm while knn and svm are more successful with the rmse values of 172 cm and 152 cm respectively by considering the acceptable limit of nse value of 0 5 in a study moriasi et al 2015 that involves a methodology with criteria based evaluations knn svm and dt models are not generated accurate predictions for lead times exceed 5 6 and 2 respectively for discussed data set results of ml regression models trained with n2 station s data and predicted tested sea level data of n1 station given on the right side of table 2 indicate the performance of ml models on transferring sea level information between data sets recorded different dates as a predictive error indicator rmse values of knn svm and dt models are found as 5 4 cm 8 cm and 12 cm respectively high accuracy of with knn in one day lead time nse 0 95 reduces as the time step increases yet an acceptable level even in seven day lead time is achieved nse 0 59 following the knn model svm provides accurate predictions for up to 6 days on the contrary its inefficacy to establish a strong connection between past and future values keeps dt from offering acceptable predictions from 4 up to 7 days the general evaluation of model sensitivity to data characteristics reveals that the methods were more successful in the information transfer between spatially close stations than periodically temporally close stations the performance of developed machine learning models based on the data recorded at the s2 station located at the southern of bosphorus is tested with data sets recorded observed sea level data sets at two northern stations n1 and n2 in different periods prediction accuracy of the models calibrated with s2 station data is used to predict daily sea level data of n1 and n2 stations is evaluated by rmse and nse values given in table 3 calculated rmse values of ml models at n2 for one day lead time prediction indicates the high performance of knn and svm methods at transferring information between two different stations data which are simultaneously recorded dt model is partly behind these two methods with rmse and nse values of 19 cm and 0 88 respectively while prediction performances of all models decrease with increasing time step between the input and predicted values the relative success of the methods remains almost the same for all lead times considering that the limit of nse value is 0 5 knn and svm models have acceptable accuracy up to 5 days however the mathematical function designed by the dt model is not sufficient to define relations between sea level components that exceed the lead time of 3 days according to the results of the models in terms of n1 data for one day lead time it can be stated that ml methods had high performance even in cases in which the predictor function was designed and tested with periodically and locally different conditions the nse value of knn svm and dt models that are trained by the data of the s2 station and predicted sea level observations of the n1 station are found to be 0 96 0 96 and 0 87 respectively for one day lead time as the lead time increases equality between svm and knn models is broken down in favor of the knn model for lead time predictions up to 3 days all developed models can generate acceptable prediction results based on the past sea level data according to the accuracy limit of nse given as 0 5 in the literature moriasi et al 2015 only knn provides acceptable results for four days lead time predictions when the lead time of four days is exceeded all developed models are insufficient for accurate prediction of sea level in bosphorus additionally to practically compare the performances of ml regression models in different locations and periods the nse values for each lead time are given with column graphs which are embedded in fig 3 graphs illustrate the sensitivity of the models to the conditions that change between training and testing data such as location difference measurement period difference and both measurement period and location difference in the model set illustrated in fig 3b for each prediction lead time the results within the acceptable limits are available and all nse values are positive it can be stated that location the consistency enhances the prediction performance and predictability period although recorded in different periods sea level data at closely located stations can be represented by a common mathematical expression on the other hand fig 3a and c reveal the performance level of the models with the same measurement periods the exchange in the data being trained and tested during the information transfer between locally different stations does not dramatically affect the results fig 3d demonstrates the relatively poor prediction performance of ml regression methods on locally and periodically different data which implies the impossibility of obtaining sea level time series after 3 days according to numerical results and visual inspections the dt model has the worst performance in predicting time series sea level data compared to knn and svm models for all scenarios and lead times 4 conclusion this study uses the performances of the developed predictive mathematical models in predicting future sea levels in bosphorus from available data that are tested in temporally and spatially different conditions the success of the modeling approach introduced in this study in transferring the learned modeling capabilities between stations located at different regions and or recorded on different dates were evaluated by means of rmse and nse metrics the essential point in transferring information between observed sea level data which have formed in response to different conditions and different statistical properties was to define a common solution space to develop machine learning models based on the generalization and adaptation capabilities with various modeling strategies were established as a result of the model structure optimization research it was determined that data pre processing such as standardization and wavelet decomposition positively contributes to the accuracy of the regression models gradual decomposition of data in different resolution levels is beneficial to the enhancement of a predictive model this distinguished model structure in linear modeling is adapted into machine learning regression models to accurately predict the sea level data for extended lead times up to 7 days it can be stated that location consistency increases the prediction performance and predictability period based on the acceptable success limits defined in terms of performance criteria ml models are able to predict accurately the daily sea level data of stations located at different regions in the bosphorus for all 7 days up to 6 days when recorded with close periods up to 3 days if recorded in different period and location considering the superiority of the estimation method independent of the scenarios svm and knn are generally performed well while dt is performed relatively poorly in transfer modeling information in the bosphorus ml models with high generalization capacity have been developed which can predict for a week ahead in variable conditions the proposed modeling approach based on the transfer of existing system information to new situations especially in regions where there are limited available or missing data are fundamental in scientific and engineering

20633,the effects of the control rod geometry on the oscillating forces and vortex shedding of one circular cylinder and another with square cross section were numerically investigated the reynolds number re based on the diameter of the main cylinder d is fixed at 200 the solutions were obtained by applying the finite volume method to the navier stokes in unsteady form the control rods cr geometries are square circular rectangle and ellipse accounting for different degrees of aerodynamic smoothness the gap spacing between the main cylinder and cr was set to 0 2d and their positions were varied in the angular range from θ 0 to θ 180 using intervals of 22 5 for both main cylinders the main flow features fall into three angular intervals representing conditions of the rods immersed in the near wake of the main cylinders located on their upper face and frontally in the first one the fluctuating lift coefficient decreased up to 58 for the main circular cylinder by using a square rod for the main square cylinder the maximum reduction was 73 the second range was characterized by gap flow formations which depended on the rod geometry and increased severely the lift forces at the frontal angular position the drag forces were reduced by rod interference these results have many potential applications in the control of fluid structure interactions since cylinders with either circular or square cross sections are ubiquitous in the engineering field keywords square cylinder circular cylinder laminar flow cfd control rod 1 introduction the study of forces generated in structures composed by cylinders with circular or square cross sections is important in the design of devices such as heat exchangers buildings bridges offshore structures marine drillers underwater pipes just to name a few the importance of the study of fluid structure interactions fsi becomes relevant in the structural integrity design of certain devices since the alternate vortex shedding in the near wake regions may induce fatigue to the element due to vibrational forces or upon entering resonance cause its collapse for a smooth cylinder of infinite length there is a classification of flow regimes as a function of the reynolds number re ρud μ which is defined by the free stream velocity u the fluid density ρ the body diameter d and the kinematic viscosity μ such classification ranges from the creeping flow dominated by viscous forces for re 5 the formation of two symmetric bubbles which grow along the streamwise direction proportionally to the re number at the range 5 re 49 the formation of a laminar oscillating and two dimensional wake at 49 re 140 194 until its subsequent transition to a three dimensional wake in the range 190 re 260 in the latter regime the end effects cause first velocity fluctuations along the spanwise coordinate karniadakis and triantafyllou 1992 and eventually the flow packages move out of phase with each other producing vortex dislocations which trigger the three dimensional vortex street apparition williamson 1989 from here in the interval 260 re 150 10 3 the wake structures present turbulent features being known as the subcritical regime williamson 1996 comprehensive reviews about the flow on a cylinder in its various flow regimes can be found in the works of williamson 1996 zdravkovich 1997 and norberg 2003 regarding the flow over arrays of two or more cylinders the resulting flow patterns are product of complex interactions among the wakes produced by the bodies commonly these are classified using additional parameters such as spacing between cylinders g d the alignment angle θ and the diameter ratio d d which are not present in the flow on an isolated cylinder for the flow over two cylinders of the same diameter a wide variety of works have been reported over the years important reviews of those works have been presented in the works of zdravkovich 1977 sumner 2010 and more recently zhou and mahbub alam 2016 in the last work the flow was classified accordingly to nine distinctive patterns depending on the spacing and angle of attack defined as single bluff body type 1 and 2 base bleed shear layer reattachment induced separation vortex impingement gap vortex pairing and enveloping gap vortex pairing splitting and enveloping and synchronized gap vortex shedding these flow patterns have been identified using visualization techniques and useful design charts have been developed for the averaged drag c d and lift coefficients c l as well as the fluctuating coefficients c d and c l in addition to the fundamental understanding of flow patterns several control methods focused on reducing drag and attenuating or eliminating vortex induced vibrations viv have been studied in general depending on the way they rely on an external energy source to operate the methods of control of blunt body wakes are classified in passive or active open or closed loop choi et al 2008 examples of active control methods for circular cylinders are rotationally oscillating cylinder lee and lee 2008 small rotating control cylinders mittal 2001 zhu and gao 2017 streamwise oscillating foil bao and tao 2013 distributed forcing kim and choi 2005 suction chen et al 2013 synthetic jets wang et al 2016 among others although promising such techniques require additional adjustments of control algorithms for optimal operation as stated by choi et al 2008 and their implementation for practical applications has been recognized as difficult zhu et al 2017 the other type of control is the passive one which does not need an external source of energy to operate for cylinders passive control implementations have commonly been focused on the flow separation and vortex shedding control examples are aligned grooved surfaces alonzo garcía et al 2015 transversal grooves i e cactus shapes by zhdanov and busse 2011 rigid or flexible splitter plates behind cylinder assi and bearman 2015 liang et al 2018 wavy surface lam and lin 2009 free to rotate triangular fairing zhu et al 2017 although simpler than the active control methods these techniques rely on changes or attachments on the cylinder walls an alternative for this latter consists of positioning a small control rod cr around the main cylinder strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 used a circular cr with d d 0 143 to control the flow over a main circular cylinder mcc at re 80 the authors reported a reduction of 20 in c d and linked the effect with partial cancellation of the vorticity ω produced by the shear layers due to rods presence similarly zhao et al 2005 studied the effect of a circular cr on a mcc at the three dimensional wake regime re 500 using a diameter ratio of 0 25 and varying the spacing between 0 05 g d 1 at small spacing g d 0 1 the wake is similar to that of an isolated circular cylinder and the c d values of the arrangement of two cylinders increase at the interval 45 θ 135 in addition given the interstitial flow the lift coefficient c l showed high negative values for other angular positions 0 θ 45 and 135 θ 180 the c d values were decreased and the repulsive forces between cylinders were considerably lower regardless of g d in such cases two mechanisms are recognized one is related to a repositioning of the separation point along the upper surface of the mcc and the other is a consequence of shear layer interference given by the small rod kuo et al 2007 used two crs of d d 0 125 located at a fixed streamwise position x d 0 5 and varied the vertical distance y d 0 6 over the range 80 re 300 it was reported that by the obstruction in the rear region created by the crs and directly related to re there is flow deflection between the cylinders gaps which increases the symmetry of the recirculating region decreases the vorticity levels and delays the main recirculation regions to downstream positions the latter effect is also related to the monotonous decreases of the fluctuating lift and drag forces another work is that of lu et al 2014 who used six circular crs over a mcc evaluating the effect of g d θ and d d in the periodic laminar regime at re 200 four flow regimes were identified and sustained reductions of c d and c l were reported in the range 0 2 g d 2 using a diameter ratio of 0 24 on other hand the square cross section cylinder is a common device used in a wide variety of engineering systems and as stated elsewhere it has not been studied as much as the circular cross section cylinder agrawal et al 2006 breuer et al 2000 chatterjee and biswas 2015 unlike circular cylinders square ones have fixed separation points and present different shedding frequencies pressure distributions and aerodynamic forces successful implementations of crs to control the flow over a main square cylinder msc in the turbulent subcritical regime have been stated in several works chauhan et al 2019 lesage and gartshore 1987 mahbub alam et al 2002 sakamoto et al 1991 sarioglu et al 2005 yen et al 2016 for example lesage and gartshore 1987 reduced the drag and fluctuating forces in the turbulent regime by using a circular cr located at different distances upstream a main cylinder of circular square and rectangular cross section shape the tested range covered the range 1 10 4 re 7 10 4 it was reported the existence of a jump spacing of around g d 2 where maximum drag reduction occurs for the three types of cylinders and the flow switches between two well defined regimes for the msc maximum attenuations of c d and c l of the order of 70 and 90 were obtained sakamoto et al 1991 studied the flow through a circular msc with a circular cr located in positions adjacent to the upper face of the square at re 4 10 4 the modifications in the structure of the shear layer induced by the control cylinder produced reductions in the order of 75 and 95 for the fluctuating draft and lift coefficients also a c d reduction of the order of 30 was reported mahbub alam et al 2002 analyzed the wake through two squares arranged in tandem varying the spacing between cylinders and using a small vertical plate as cr the work was performed at the subcritical regime at re 5 6 10 4 when the spacing between the cr and the first prism is between 1 5 g d 1 9 the alternation of vortices in the wake of the first cylinder is suppressed obtaining significant reductions in c d and c l for the front cylinder the maximum reductions in these parameters were of around 71 and 94 with the reductions for the rear cylinder being of 65 and 80 recently chauhan et al 2019 employed two circular control rods placed symmetrically in the upper and lower faces of the square using the values of re 485 re 805 and re 1290 a maximum drag reduction of 38 was reported at re 1290 when the crs are located in x d 0 5 and y d 0 6 in the same cr location a reduction of 30 in the strouhal number st was also found for the laminar periodic regime this problem seems to be less explored firat et al 2015 analyzed numerically the effect of a circular cr located in front of the msc rotating the assembly between 0 and 90 varying the spacing between 1 g l 4 at re 200 according to the authors when the cr is located in front of the msc and at g l 3 the c d could be reduced up to 46 whereas the c l about 68 according to the above extensive efforts have been made to study the suppression of hydrodynamic forces on mcc or msc for separated commonly in these works one or more circular rods or small vertical flat plates were used for the msc most of works have been made at the subcritical regime whereas the laminar flow has not been deeply explored also regardless of the geometry of the main cylinder to the authors knowledge a systematic study focused on the effect of the cr geometry on the flow over a blunt body at the laminar regime had not been attempted before in this sense it is known that the cr wake depends on its cross section and re number derakhshandeh and alam 2019 therefore rods of different shapes are expected to produce distinctive perturbations which in turn alter the main cylinder vortex street evolution and oscillating forces the main objective of this work is to assess the effect of the rod geometry in the flow over a main cylinder with either circular or square cross section as both geometries are ubiquitous in the engineering field four cr geometries are tested by considering gradual variations of their aerodynamic smoothness these are square fixed separation points and wide wake circular movable separations point and wide wake rectangle fixed separation points and narrow wake and the ellipse movable separation points and narrow wake the research was performed re 200 to provide more insight about the control effects in the periodic laminar regime the simulations were validated using experimental data and simulations for the isolated circular and square cylinder cases from other works also the flow over a main circular cylinder with a circular cr at different angular locations was used for comparison the information presented here can be used to optimize flow control through a cr of certain geometry on different devices operating on a laminar regime as most of the works of control by cylinders have been made with circular rods the results presented herein are promising for future analysis in the turbulent regime and in other applications related to heat transfer control 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations the flow is assumed to be two dimensional unsteady incompressible laminar and newtonian the governing equations for this type of fluids are expressed by the two dimensional navier stokes n s eqs 1 2b continuity 1 u x x u y y 0 momentum 2a u x t u x u x x u y u x y p x 1 r e 2 u x x 2 2 u x y 2 2b u y t u x u y x u y u y y p y 1 r e 2 u y x 2 2 u y y 2 in those equations u x u y are the dimensionless velocity components along x and y directions of a cartesian coordinate system and p is the pressure the time averaged drag and lift coefficients are defined by eqs 3 and 4 being f d and f l the time averaged drag and lift forces d represent the largest cylinder diameter u denotes the free stream velocity and ρ is the fluid density 3 c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 d 4 c l f l 1 2 ρ u 2 d in eqs 3 and 4 the time averaged drag and lift forces are defined by eqs 5

location upstream the pair of cylinders 2 2 computational domain and boundary conditions the simulations were performed using the fluent v 15 0 implicit pressure based solver which applies the finite volume method to solve the n s equations as shown in fig 1 a the computational domain was a square of 40d 40d which was based according to the recommendations stated on the works of kumar and mittal 2006 and lu et al 2014 all grids were composed of triangular cells at the inlet a dirichlet boundary condition bc u x u u y 0 was imposed while a pressure outlet bc was set for the outlet of the computational domain the non slip bc u x 0 u y 0 was imposed on cylinder walls and symmetry was employed on the upper and lower faces of the domain the pressure velocity coupling was performed by using the piso algorithm the spatial discretization was performed by a second order upwind scheme for the momentum equations whereas the standard algorithm was used for the pressure the temporal terms were treated with a bounded second order implicit scheme in the cylinder simulations which include a cr the angle between the positive x axis and the center of the control rods was denoted by θ which for all simulations varied from 0 to 180 using intervals of 22 5 as shown in fig 1 b four rod geometries were tested for each main cylinder these control rods were defined in terms of the characteristic length d shown in fig 2 and they were inspired on common engineering shapes of easy manufacture regarding the gap distance g between either the mcc or the msc and the small rod it was fixed to g d 0 2 being the diameter ratio of d d 0 25 from such a cylinder ratio the re of the crs have values around 50 thus two dimensional laminar vortex shedding is expected in the rear zones of the rods these spacing and diameter ratio have been previously associated to drag reduction in a mcc by means of one circular control rod by zhao et al 2005 2 3 mesh independence analysis to verify a grid independent solution four grids ranging from 44 5 103 to 399 103 cells were used to solve the base case of the flow over an isolated circular cylinder at the 2d unsteady wake regime re 200 in all simulations the computational time step δt was fixed according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criteria using an empirical safe coefficient c t 0 2 to assure stability on the predictions in eq 11 s e represents the area of the smallest mesh cell and u is the mean stream velocity 11 t c t m i n s e u each time step was solved with a convergence criterion of 1 10 6 in the continuity and flow velocities u x and u y and it was reached within 30 sub iterations in all simulations the time averaged results were obtained from data collected from at least 8 residence times collected after wake development as shown in table 1 the overall sizes for both the total number of cells and nodal count n uniformly imposed along the cylinder walls were sequentially doubled in order to avoid false spatial convergence especially in the near wall calculations in all grids the proximity and curvature algorithm of the ansys meshing software was applied starting from the value of 1 03 for the m1 grid the growth rate values were decreased to 1 01 in the m3 and m4 grids to obtain a smooth refinement near the cylinder walls the average and maximum skewness levels of the resulting grids were lower than the 0 33 and 0 95 values recommended in the ansys fluent user s guide ansys fluent v 12 0 2009 some details of the near cylinder regions are shown in fig 3 according to the results of the mean c d and the amplitude of the lift coefficient c l a shown in table 1 the percentage difference between m3 and m4 grids was of 0 4 for the c d 0 15 for the c l a and 0 051 for the st the grid convergence index gci is a conservative estimator of uncertainty between grids and it was calculated according to the procedure for non uniform grids reported by celik and karatekin 1997 using the m2 m3 and m4 grids solutions the resulting uncertainty values for c d and c l a were 0 31 and 0 13 between the m3 and m4 grids accordingly the m3 grid was considered as the outline for all other runs in order to alleviate the computational time needed for every run for this grid the minimum wall distance was of δy min 0 0051 which is around the 0 004 value used by kumar de and dalal 2006 and lower than the half of the 0 0115 value used by linnick and fasel 2005 2 4 validation of the numerical model with other literature data 2 4 1 fluid flow past an isolated circular cylinder and a square cylinder firstly it was validated the numerical model comparing the c d c l a and st by simulating the flow over an isolated circular cylinder at re 200 and comparing the results with available data from other works as shown in table 2 deviations smaller than 2 3 were found for c d in comparison to the implicit forced immersed boundary method ibm simulations performed by le et al 2008 which was the case that exhibited the largest difference in values for c l a a difference around 4 was found in comparison to the cell boundary element method cell bem performed by farrant et al 2000 see c l a 0 71 versus c l a 0 68 of the results reported in this work the non dimensional vortex shedding frequency st was slightly overestimated also by about 4 in comparison to the ibm simulations of le et al 2008 for the other works the differences were lower than 2 for the three assessed parameters thus the present results are considered in fair agreement with previously reported data another case used for validation purposes was the laminar flow past an isolated squared cylinder with unsteady wake to compare directly our results to other available data the simulation was performed at re 100 and the predicted results of c d c l and st are summarized in table 3 for the c d a maximum difference of 3 3 in comparison to the work of lam et al 2012 was found the fluctuating lift coefficient deviated about 5 5 from those of the works of kumar de and dalal 2006 and lam et al 2012 which applied the finite volume method finally for st the maximum deviation was 5 0 and corresponded to the work of breuer et al 2000 the differences of st between the work of breuer et al 2000 and those presented by other researchers might be caused by the higher conditions of blockage bl as well as the use of a parabolic velocity profile at the inlet in this sense the other works applied uniform inlet velocity profiles 2 4 2 fluid flow past two circular cylinders with different angles of attack furthermore the numerical model is validated considering an arrangement of a mcc and circular cr at re 500 for different θ positions such increase in re allows analyzing the response of our models in the onset of a turbulent wake which in our case may be generated by the local acceleration existent in the gap between cylinders for some particular cr shape also the nature of the repulsive forces could be assessed in this case the cr was discretized by using nd d 50 cells uniformly disposed in its periphery similarly to the work of lu et al 2014 the same discretization remained for the other cr geometries discussed in the results section fig 4 shows the comparison of c d and c l obtained using g d 0 2 with the works of zhao et al 2005 and lu et al 2014 a good correspondence between the results presented here and those works is shown the numerical model was able to replicate fairly well the wake interference caused by the cr at 0 θ 80 and the delay of the separation point induced when the cr is located in the frontal positions of the main cylinder in the range 124 θ 180 both mechanisms were associated to drag reduction in the main cylinder by zhao et al 2005 regarding the lift force the model reproduced the c l 0 in θ 0 and θ 180 which are related to the cr located either in the front part or in the rear part of the main cylinder also a negative lift at 67 5 θ 135 was present the maximum difference in c d was 3 8 at θ 45 in comparison to the work of zhao et al 2005 and 18 in c l at θ 90 a better agreement was achieved with the work of lu et al 2014 as the differences at the same angular positions were 2 7 and 4 9 for c d and c l respectively from the analysis above it was demonstrated the good agreement between the present results and other data from literature for the isolated circular and isolated square cases also the drag reduction effect induced by a circular cr located at certain θ was fairly reproduced even for re 500 which is related to turbulent wake structures at distant streamwise positions 2 4 3 the influence of the re number in the solutions for both main cylinder geometries it is recognized from the literature that some three dimensional features may not be captured in two dimensional simulations as the reynolds number of 200 may be considered strictly transitional therefore additional runs were performed at re 160 for the isolated circular cylinder and the mcc and a square cr at θ 67 5 the comparison of the results in terms of time averaged streamlines and dimensionless z vorticity patterns ω ω z d u between re 160 and re 200 are shown in fig 5 no significant differences were observed between the resulting flow patterns moreover as shown in table 4 for the isolated circular cylinder at re 200 the differences between the present results for st and c d and those of rajani et al 2009 who used 3d domains were below 3 this agreement is explained by considering that the reynolds number of 200 barely exceeded the value for the onset of the mode a instability which according to williamson 1989 appears at re 190 and it is not characterized by fine scale vortices furthermore for the mcc and the square cr the values of c d c l and st between both re were very similar confirming the notion that the results obtained for re 200 were not strongly influenced by the lack of the third spatial component of the domains further simulations were applied for the main square cylinder in this case the isolated square cylinder and the msc with a circular rod at θ 157 5 at re 100 were used as representative as shown in table 5 good agreement is observed between the present results and those reported by berrone et al 2011 for the isolated square case at both reynolds numbers although not shown here for brevity no significant differences in terms of flow patterns were also obtained for the representative cases between the two reynolds numbers at both re the msc with a circular rod case presented a drag reduction of about 13 15 depending on the re an increase of lift and similar st values thus for the msc the overall tendencies obtained at re 200 were considered as representative of the unsteady two dimensional wake regime 3 results 3 1 analysis of the main cylinders drag and lift coefficients as a function of θ the c d and c l for the mcc obtained at different θ positions from the tested crs are shown in fig 6 a and c for comparison purposes those corresponding to the msc are shown in fig 6 b and d at θ 0 the crs are fully immersed behind the main cylinder wake for the mcc the square cr induced a minimum value of c d 1 19 which is about 12 lower than the c d 1 35 of the isolated circular cylinder dashed line the drag reduction obtained by using the ellipse cr was modest and it was of around 8 the c d obtained by using the other two cr geometries were bounded by those values at θ 22 5 the tendency remained the same although all crs caused lower decreases of c d at θ 45 the c d value obtained by using the square cr almost reached that of the isolated cylinder whereas a slight drag reduction of about 7 was induced by the circular cr when the control rods were closer to the region where the upper primary shear layer is detached in 67 5 θ 90 the c d values were strongly influenced by the cr geometry while the ellipse cr induced about 10 in drag reduction at θ 67 5 the c d obtained using a square cr increased up to 12 6 here the mcc c d values produced by the rectangle and circular rods were close to the base case value at θ 112 5 the c d values were almost independent on the cr shape and no significant drag reductions or increases were observed as the crs are moved to frontal locations in the range of 135 θ 180 the most significant decreases in drag were observed at θ 157 5 a decrease of the order of 30 of c d was given by the square cr while about 22 5 was achieved the circular and the rectangular rods at the same θ the ellipse cr induced moderated decreases in drag in comparison to the other rods however this geometry presented a sustained drag reduction effect in almost all the θ positions being its maximum decrease of 17 at θ 180 for the msc case shown in fig 6 b when the crs are located in the rear part of the square at θ 22 5 slight drag reductions around 3 were obtained regardless of the cr geometry on the other hand in the range 45 θ 135 that is when the crs are located around the upper side of the cylinder the c d increased strongly in all cases the maximum value of 40 is given by the square cr at θ 67 5 while the lowest increase of 12 4 was produced by the ellipse cr thus at those angular locations the rod geometry is highly influential on the drag increase in the frontal region of the msc at 157 5 θ 180 all rods induced drag reduction at θ 180 the square cr induced a maximum drag reduction of c d of 24 in the same position a minimum decrease of 14 was obtained by using the ellipse cr the drag coefficients of the rectangle and circular crs were almost identical being about 17 lower than the base case value similarly to the mcc the ellipse cr induced the most moderated decreases or increases of c d in all angular locations by comparing fig 6 a and b in all θ range the msc coefficients were larger in comparison to those of the mcc as the body is less streamlined zhao et al 2005 explained the drag reduction by a circular cr at small angular locations i e θ 45 in terms of interference in the primary shear layers rolling up which takes place from the top and bottom walls of the main cylinder according to our results for the msc the cr geometry has a moderate impact on the drag reduction on the other hand at the frontal positions 135 θ 180 the drag reduction is a consequence of the shielding effect induced by the cr presence for the mcc this latter effect was found to be more dependent on the cr geometry especially at θ 157 5 the time averaged c l coefficients of both main cylinders are shown in fig 6 c and d in the angular positions θ 0 and θ 180 the wake is symmetric in the y direction and the c l 0 for both main cylinders as the crs are rotated in the range 45 θ 112 5 important repulsive forces arose as a consequence of a gap flow formation inducing negative lift coefficients on both main cylinders the maximum negative values of c l 0 6 for the mcc and c l 1 1 for the msc coincided with the square cr located at θ 67 5 independently of their shapes the rods produced a positive lift peak of around c l 0 1 in both main cylinders when located at θ 22 5 for the mcc a second positive peak of similar magnitude is observed at θ 157 5 corresponding to the crs located near the frontal part of the main cylinder similar positive peaks were also found by zhao et al 2005 3 2 the r m s of the cl and st of the main cylinders as a function of θ the fluctuating lift coefficient c l at the different θ positions obtained for the mcc and msc are shown in fig 7 a and b for the mcc all crs produced a sustained reduction of fluctuating lift when the crs were located in the rear part of the mcc at θ 0 the c l was decreased in around 48 using the ellipse and the rectangular rods here the values produced by the square and circular rods were 58 lower than the base case value at θ 22 5 the fluctuating coefficients of the different crs increased and the values presented some dispersion at θ 45 the c l of the mcc becomes highly dependent on the cr geometry excepting for the ellipse cr which produced an increase of c l from 0 35 at θ 22 5 to 0 40 at θ 45 the other rods decreased the c l values here a maximum reduction of about 75 of c l was given by the circular cr for all cases the maximum decreases of 88 92 were obtained when the small rods were immersed on the upper shear layer formation region at θ 67 5 it is noticeable that at this angular position the c d and c l values were highly dependent on the cr geometry but it was not the case for c l in the range 90 θ 180 the c l values were recovered and moderate influence on the cr geometry was observed at θ 180 the crs are located in front of the mcc without any interaction with the wake formation region in this position the highest decrease of 21 was induced by the square rod whereas the lowest decrease of 11 was produced by the ellipse rod for the msc case decreases in the c l were observed when the crs were located in the square rear at 0 θ 45 and at the frontal position θ 180 for the latter angles excepting for θ 45 the c l values were similar for all rods at θ 112 5 the circular and ellipse crs were capable to decrease the fluctuating forces the maximum decreases of around 68 73 were obtained for the circular and square crs at θ 45 at the same θ the rectangular cr decreased the c l by about 40 the ellipse cr presented the minimum c l value at θ 112 5 and it was 42 lower than the base case in contrast to the mcc case increases of the fluctuating lift forces were obtained in the positions θ 67 5 θ 90 and θ 135 which depended on the cr geometry being especially larger for the square rod for the latter geometry the c l increased more than 100 at θ 135 at this angular position the most streamlined rod ellipse cr induced a 50 of increase in the c l although not desirable for purposes of mitigation of viv the latter increases in the fluctuating lift forces may find some applications on energy harvester devices composed of oscillating slender cylinders chizfahm et al 2018 excepting for the cases where the crs were located directly in front of the mcc at θ 180 the st showed a dependency on the shape of the crs for the other angular locations all rod shapes induced minimum st values at θ 90 which coincided with the crs vertically aligned with the mcc the maximum decreases of st were bounded between the maximum of 25 given by the square cr and a minimum of 17 induced by the elliptic one for the mcc and this re the location of a cr in the range 67 5 θ 157 5 is favorable for st reduction purposes note that at θ 67 5 the c l values are also importantly attenuated and even a slight drag reduction was given by the ellipse cr about 10 for the msc the highest st attenuations were present at θ 135 for all cases which corresponded to angular shifting from the θ 90 present for the mcc to a frontal angular position here the largest decreases were produced by the square and circular crs being of 21 and 18 respectively in contrast to the mcc at the frontal position θ 0 the st of the msc increased between 12 and 18 depending on the rod shape 3 3 the total drag and lift coefficients of the two cylinder system the total drag and lift coefficients c d arr and c l arr obtained for the system of both cylinders are shown in fig 8 a and b they were calculated by adding the contribution of the mean averaged force of the corresponding cr and using d d as the equivalent diameter in eqs 3 and 4 for the mcc the total drag coefficients increased in the range 67 5 θ 135 forming a semi parabolic profile this is because at those θ locations the free flow impinges directly upon the crs causing additional positive contributions to the total drag force the values of the arrangements mcc and circular and square crs were maximum at θ 90 the corresponding values for these cylinder arrangements surpassed the base case value by 13 and 22 respectively at θ 0 the crs are fully immersed in the near wake formation region where pressure values are negative as a consequence the drag forces generated on the crs are opposite to the flow direction and the c d arr values were lower in comparison to those corresponding to c d shown in fig 6 a at this position the c d arr values were decreased about 30 regardless of the rod geometry at the frontal position θ 180 the c d arr values corresponding to all crs were 26 below the base case value for all angular positions the c d arr of the system mcc and ellipse cr showed a sustained drag reduction effect for the msc the c d arr values induced by the square circular and rectangle crs exceeded the base case value in the range 67 5 θ 135 for the msc and square cr arrangement the total drag was linearly attenuated from the maximum of c d arr 2 07 at θ 67 5 until c d arr 1 75 at θ 135 for the arrangements given by the rectangle and ellipse crs the c d arr profiles were flatter no significant increases of the c d arr were present for the arrangement msc and ellipse cr at θ 0 the total drag forces were decreased further about 25 vs 3 discussed in fig 6 b as the cr mean forces acted oppositely to the mean flow direction at θ 180 maximum drag reductions of about 30 were obtained for all arrangements almost independently on the cr shape excepting for θ 0 and θ 180 the overall repulsive lift forces experienced by the small rods are positive as a consequence the total negative lift coefficients in the range 45 θ 90 have smaller magnitudes than the corresponding c l plotted in fig 8 c and d for the mcc the total lift values are positive at θ 112 5 contrary to the negative values of c l in the same position this is because the positive lift contribution of the rods surpassed the negative repulsive force exerted over the main cylinder accounted for in c l the same effect but at θ 135 was observed in the c l arr of the msc arrangements as expected from the additional positive lift forces from rods the mcc c l arr values at θ 135 and θ 157 5 were higher than those of c l a similar effect was observed for the msc 3 4 time averaged pressure coefficient along the periphery of the cylinder from the previous section it could be seen that the dimensionless numbers are strongly influenced by the rod angular location to perform further analysis three significant angular intervals for the rod location were defined the first range 0 θ 45 represents conditions of the control rod immersed in the rear wake of the main cylinders in the second range given by 45 θ 135 the cr is located around the upper face of the main cylinder and in the third range 135 θ 180 the cr is located frontally figs 9 and 10 show the pressure coefficients obtained in the periphery of the mcc and msc for the crs located at the rear θ 0 in the upper face θ 67 5 θ 157 5 and frontally at θ 180 at θ 0 the base pressure behind the mcc was recovered as a consequence of the rod presence in the frontal angular positions close to the stagnation point at α 180 there were no differences in values regarding to the base case the decrease in the pressure deficit of the mcc rear is explained by considering that in such location the crs are immersed directly in the near wake formation region in this sense as the shedding takes place the flow packages which pass through the gap spacing between cylinders pressurize the rear part of the large cylinder by the formation of a gap flow and induce a negative drag in the small rod in the position θ 67 5 the crs were immersed in the formation region of the primary upper shear layer in this position the values of c l and st were highly attenuated while the c l values increased for the mcc excepting for the ellipse cr the other rod geometries induced increases of the c d values in the lower rear part of the mcc at 270 α 360 the base pressure raised the most moderate increase was given by the square cr in the upper rear part of the mcc at 0 α 50 the values of c p decayed here the c p 1 2 and c p 1 0 values of the square and circular rods were lower than the base case value from there pressures suffer a steep increase that persisted until α 180 producing two peculiar and opposite effects on drag that is at α 90 the pressure increases favoring drag reduction as the rear mcc pressure deficit is attenuated see dashed circle 1 in fig 9 b however at 90 α 180 the effect is contrary since now the pressure components are acting in the flow direction between these effects the second one dominates since in the frontal region i e the range 135 α 180 see dashed circle 2 the cosine components of c p which are acting directly in the x direction are larger than those around 45 α 90 on the other hand the sine components of c p acting on the upper face of the mcc at 67 5 α 135 induced high negative lift forces as they are larger than those acting oppositely at 225 α 292 5 when the crs are moved to a frontal position at θ 157 5 the c p profiles were asymmetric and almost independent on the rod geometry the base pressures suffered moderate recoveries of about 10 in the rear part of the mcc 0 α 90 and 270 α 360 for all cases because the crs shielded the pressures exerted on the front upper face of the mcc the drag forces were decreased at θ 180 the crs shielding effect in the range 157 α 203 is even more evident and again similar base pressure recoveries are produced the corresponding c p distributions for the msc at the same angular cr locations described for the mcc are shown in fig 10 at θ 0 the upper down and rear faces exhibited pressure deficits characterized by negative c p values as they are now fully immersed in the near wake formation two negative minimum peaks of about c p 2 25 coincided with the upper and lower vertices d and f of the front face where the flow is separated from there the pressures were gradually recovered until the c p 0 74 of the rear face h a b independently of their geometries the crs induced moderate pressure increases in the upper lower and rear walls at θ 67 5 the upper wall increased its pressure levels by the gap flow formation which explains the negative high lifts of fig 6 d also along the rear face h a b the pressure deficits were increased by rod presence at θ 157 5 the h a b rear pressure levels were the same as those of the base case however by flow interference the rods induced decreases of c p in the front msc face which in turn attenuated the msc drag forces at θ 180 the front face pressures were further decreased and the base pressures were slightly recovered independently of the cr geometry to assess comparatively the base pressure recovery induced by the rods fig 11 shows the ratio between the base pressures of the main cylinders at certain cr angular location c pb cr with their corresponding isolated cases here c pb mcc stands for the base pressure of the isolated circular cylinder whereas c pb msc refers to that for the isolated square one from fig 11 a all crs reduced the base pressure deficit in the mcc independently on their θ locations the values of c pb cr c pb mcc depended on the cr shape in the rear θ 0 and θ 67 5 cr locations the pressure deficits were reduced by a maximum of about 24 for the square cr at θ 0 and 25 for the ellipse cr at θ 67 5 at the other angular positions such dependence is small as now the crs are located in front of the main cylinder for the msc shown in fig 11 b it was observed a different behavior at θ 67 5 the pressure deficit surpassed in all cases the value given by the isolated square and they were influenced by the cr geometry the maximum pressure deficit was produced by the square cr being about 55 larger than that of the isolated cylinder in the other angular locations the ratios were almost independent on the cr shape and the decrease of pressure deficit was moderated the maximum decrease of around 12 was given by the square cr at θ 180 3 5 time averaged streamlines for the main circular and main square cylinders and cr models the time averaged streamlines patterns for the mcc and msc are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively for the cases where the flow is symmetric at θ 0 and θ 180 the two main recirculation bubbles defined by the shedding of the upper and lower shear layers were elongated along the streamwise direction also two new recirculation bubbles of low velocities were visible in the gap spacing between the mcc and the crs at θ 0 these recirculation bubbles represent regions where the vortex shedding is obstructed and repulsive forces that pressurized the rear cylinder appeared at θ 67 5 the flow symmetry has been lost and the bubbles were relocated an interstitial flow is visible in the spacing between mcc and cr this gap flow altered the vortex shedding process and shifted the upper separation and the stagnation point of the main cylinder in this angular position the flow features presented some resemblance to the base bleeding regime reported by sumner et al 2000 for two circular cylinders of the same diameter the recirculation regions induced by the square circular and rectangular rods were similar and they were defined by four bubbles as it is shown in the inset of fig 12 one large bubble 1 was visible behind each cr and two asymmetric ones 2 and 3 were visible on the lower rear part of the mcc in all cases the fourth bubble was located at a more distant position 4 at about x d 2 5 y d 0 5 for the flow patterns induced by the ellipse cr one of the two recirculation bubbles located at the rear of the mcc was not present and the remaining one 2 was larger and redirected in the streamwise direction also as this rod geometry has the most streamlined shape the bubble 1 located behind the rod is smaller and deflected in comparison to the other crs another difference is that the furthest bubble 3 is now located at a lower vertical position at x d 2 y d 0 25 these changes pointed out differences between the shear layer interactions given by the ellipse cr and the others at θ 157 5 the high velocity gap flow is located near the upper front face of the mcc injecting momentum to the upper main recirculation bubble which is now elongated and larger in comparison to the lower one and that of the base case for the more streamlined crs the lower main recirculation bubble is not formed at θ 180 the crs are located directly in front of the mcc and the flow impinged upon the main cylinder is shielded and the flow patterns showed resemblance to the cavity flow mode reported by prasad and williamson 1997 and tsutsui and igarashi 2002 at the subcritical regime the upper and lower separation points α 1 and α 2 as well as the angle of the stagnation point α 0 obtained for the mcc and the crs are shown in table 6 at θ 0 no important delay or anticipation of the separation points was observed and the values were similar to that of the base case as a consequence of the gap flow formation at θ 67 5 the upper separation point was notably delayed from the 70 5 value of the isolated circular cylinder for the square circular and rectangle the values were between α 1 13 6 and α 1 15 4 whereas for the ellipse cr the angle was of α 1 32 1 as the gap flow direction was different from the others the angles of the lower separation point α 2 were not highly affected besides the square cr induced shifting of the stagnation point from α 0 180 to an upper position of α 0 172 8 the other rods presented shifting variations lower than 3 5 this movement of the stagnation points is also related to the high negative lift forces shown in fig 6 c at the frontal position θ 157 5 the upper separation angle was delayed by about 10 2 for the square cylinder and 8 3 for the rectangle and ellipse crs the effect on the stagnation point is opposite as now it has been shifted to a lower position inducing at the same time a retardation of the lower separation point α 2 as a consequence the lift forces experienced by the mcc are now positive when the crs were located at the frontal position θ 180 some delay of the separation points of around 3 5 were present for the square circular and rectangle crs which are related to a lower pressure deficit in the rear cylinder part and the drag reduction effect as shown in fig 13 for the msc and at θ 0 the recirculation bubbles were the same as those of the isolated case that is two symmetric bubbles were located on the rear part between cylinders and two other ones at the upper and lower faces however similarly to the mcc two additional and smaller bubbles appeared in the gap spacing between cylinders for the msc they induced a lower deficit recovery of the base pressure in comparison to the mcc by considering that the shear layers of an isolated square are more elongated in comparison to those of the circular cylinder at re 200 derakhshandeh and alam 2019 the control rods were possibly located in a region where the shear layers had lower kinetic energy compared to the mcc case weakening the vortex shedding interference effect at the rear location θ 67 5 the gap flow between cylinders interrupted the formation length of the upper face vortex and injected additional momentum into the upper shear layer for the square and circular crs this additional momentum decomposed the upper rear bubble into two vortices whereas for the more streamlined crs the same upper bubble was only distorted in all cases the lower main bubble 3 was shifted to a downstream position and it was smaller than that of the base case at the frontal position θ 157 5 the gap flow decreased the size of the bubble attached in the upper face of the msc this is especially noticeable for the square and circular crs also the upper rear bubbles were slightly elongated along the flow direction almost independently of the cr shape at θ 180 the thickness and sizes of the bubbles attached to the upper and lower msc faces were decreased importantly for the square cr also the frontal msc faces were shielded from flow impingement some additional detail of the upper and lower bubbles attached on msc faces as well as the interference effect in terms of the magnitude of velocity are presented in fig 14 the area covered by the mean recirculation bubbles a cr in proportion to the corresponding main cylinder cross section area a cs is presented in fig 15 here the a r values were extracted from the time averaged streamlines of figs 12 and 13 for the mcc in the rear positions θ 0 and θ 67 5 the a r values were significantly larger in comparison to the base case at θ 0 the a r value of the square cr was two times larger in comparison to the isolated cylinder however the largest values were present at θ 67 5 where the a r given by the circular cr was 5 times larger in comparison to the base case by considering that the regions influenced by the shear layer motions were considerably extended slower shedding motions are expected which are reflected in the low values of st shown in fig 7 c in the frontal θ 157 5 and θ 180 locations the a r increases were not as large as those of the rear position and in general they were independent of the cr shape for the msc the largest a r values were present at θ 0 independent on the cr geometry the recirculation regions were about 40 larger than the base case value at θ 67 5 the circular cr induced an increase of 25 whereas the a r values given by the rectangle and square crs were similar to the 2 05 value of the base case at θ 157 5 the increases were moderated while at 180 the recirculation regions were slightly decreased in all cr cases note that in θ 180 the st of fig 7 d increased 3 6 mean velocity profiles along the wake centerline for the mcc and msc the time averaged dimensionless u x profiles obtained at the wake centerline at y d 0 for several angular cr locations and the mcc are shown in fig 16 at θ 0 the wake velocities suffered a sustained decrease in the range of 1 0 x d 5 0 in comparison to the isolated cylinder profile the lowest velocities were produced by the square cr and the highest were obtained for the rectangular cr the profiles obtained for the mcc and the circular and ellipse crs were similar also for all cr cases small plateaus of near zero velocity were found in the gap spacing between cylinders at x d 1 0 other effects included elongations of the rear recirculation length visible in the points where velocity passes from negative to positive i e x d 1 7 2 2 depending on the cr and higher peak values of negative velocity note that the recirculation length is a measure of the mean wake elongation along the x direction and it is different from the parameter a r discussed early at θ 67 5 the gap flow disrupted the near rear wall vortex formation region the profiles induced by the square circular and rectangle rods were very similar as a consequence of the gap flow see inset of fig 16 b there were positive velocities with maximums ranging from u x u 0 25 0 28 depending on the rod shape at the location x d 1 0 this latter was not the case for the ellipse cr as the gap flow is redirected the same line passes now through a negative velocity zone all cases presented deficits of velocity in the regions 2 0 x d 5 0 when the crs are located now in the frontal mcc positions θ 157 5 and θ 180 similar velocity deficits were observed in the range of 1 0 x d 5 0 however the profiles were almost independent of the cr shape note that at these positions the c d values were higher than those found at the rear θ 0 and θ 67 5 suggesting that the shielding effect dominates for such purposes as shown in fig 17 for the msc similar wake profiles were found between the crs at the four tested angular locations at θ 0 the profiles exhibited a velocity plateau at 0 5 x d 1 0 also the crs produced an elongation in the recirculation length at 0 5 x d 2 5 and moderate velocity deficits in the range 1 5 x d 5 0 here the negative peak values of u x u 0 34 were closer than the u x u 0 30 value of the base case in general these effects were less pronounced than those observed for the mcc at θ 67 5 now the base case profile presents the highest negative peak values and the recirculation lengths of the cr cases were shorter additionally the rods caused a velocity recovery in the range of 0 5 x d 5 5 at the downstream positions x d 6 5 excepting for the ellipse cr the other rods induced velocity deficits in this angular location all crs induced drag increases when the crs were located at the frontal positions θ 157 5 and θ 180 the wake profiles were almost identical between crs cases and showed slight velocity deficits at x d 3 5 3 7 vortex shedding features of the two main cylinders at significant angular locations the temporal evolution of dimensionless z vorticity ω ω z d u and streamlines corresponding to one period of vortex shedding at the cr locations of θ 0 θ 67 5 θ 157 5 and θ 180 are shown in figs 18 21 in the frontal and rear cr angular positions θ 0 and θ 180 the time averaged flow patterns exhibited low dependence on the cr geometry for both main cylinders see i e that the mean wake is symmetric at such angles in figs 12 and 13 furthermore as the square cr induced the lowest c d and c d arr values in both main cylinders it was selected as representative cr in the analysis of the wake formation originated in the main cylinders in the intermediate rear and frontal positions at θ 67 5 and θ 157 5 parameters as c l arr and the c p and c f distributions were strongly dependent on the cr geometry moreover the values of such parameters were bounded between the values given by the square and ellipse rods accordingly such geometries were chosen to depict the mcc and msc wake formations at these positions for comparison purposes in fig 18 a and b are included the wake formations of the isolated circular and isolated square cylinders for all cases the wake formation is defined by two primary shear layers of opposite signs which roll up alternately starting in the first quarter of the period t 4 c l 0 the primary positive vortex a created by the lower shear layer rotating anticlockwise is detached from the isolated circular cylinder in the upper main cylinder rear part a small upper vortex b is rotating in the clockwise direction and it is connected with the a through an alleyway flow as shown in the arrow path at the location of maximum c l at 2t 4 the upper primary shear layer has been elongated and the a vortex is absent now the b vortex has grown significantly covering most of the cylinder rear part below this vortex it is located a small anticlockwise vortex a at 3 4t and 4 4t the flow characteristics are the same as those of t 4 and 2t 4 but the vortices have opposite senses of rotations and locations when the cr is present the alleyway flows shown in t 4 and 3t 4 are redirected as a consequence the smaller vortices a and b are grown and extended along the cr and the main detached vortices a and b are shifted to downstream locations at 2t 4 and 4t 4 the b and a vortices attached on the rear cylinder fully enveloped the small rod and were larger in comparison to those of the isolated cylinder for the msc the separation points are fixed to the corners of its front face forming two new vortices on the cylinder upper and lower faces depicted as a and b the resulting shear layers and primary a and b vortices of the msc are more elongated and wide in comparison to those of the mcc at the time t 4 the small clockwise b neighbor to the rear upper msc face has a less rounded shape in comparison to that of the mcc at 2t 4 the vortex b grows and the b vortex covers a larger part of the upper square face now the lower face clockwise vortex a is almost detached from the square at the later instants 3t 4 and 4t 4 the wake evolves in symmetrical form the overall effects induced by the square cr were similar to those discussed for the mcc in the instant t 4 the upper secondary vortex b is elongated over the upper rod face causing an offset in the alleyway flow this effect brings in turn a shifting of the detached a vortex to a further downstream location at 2t 4 the b vortex grows enveloping fully the square rod at the same time the a vortex is almost detached from the lower corner at the instants 3t 4 and 4t 4 the same wake features were visible but now driven by their corresponding opposite rotating vortices as shown in fig 19 a and b when the rods are rotated at θ 67 5 the flow symmetry has been lost at the different instants of the wake evolution each cr develop its characteristic wake and new vortices of different sizes appear and interact creating complex wake structures for the mcc and t 4 the ellipse cr induced an important elongation of the lower primary shear layer in comparison to that of the isolated cylinder although more moderated the same effect was visible for the square cr in the spacing between cylinders there are two shear layers of opposite signs which divert the flow differently for the square cr the gap shear layers injected additional momentum to the lower primary shear layer causing the relocation of the detached counterclockwise vortex a to a further downstream position here the negative gap shear layer covered almost the upper half of the mcc and moved down the small b vortex to a lower y coordinate the latter effect is reflected in the important delay of the upper separation point α 1 discussed previously in section 3 5 for the square circular and rectangle crs for the mcc and the ellipse cr such negative shear layer not only relocated the small b vortex but also created an extended alleyway flow on the other hand the positive gap shear layer induced flow motions almost parallel to the flow direction retarding to farther positions the upwash flow from the lower primary shear layer besides this horizontally directed flow inhibited the upwash flow coming from the lower primary shear layer relocating the a vortex to a lower y coordinate in comparison to that of the isolated cylinder although not shown here the latter could be observed by comparing the u y profiles obtained at the wake centerline for the mcc and ellipse cr versus the isolated circular cylinder by its shape the square cr shielded the upper primary shear layer and its wake was mainly defined by a large clockwise vortex b for the ellipse cr the upper primary shear layer is thinner and more aligned to the flow direction behind the ellipse cr two small secondary counter rotating vortices a and b were found at 2t 2 and the square cr the upper shear layer vortex b has evolved and increased in size canceling the a vortex detached from the lower primary shear layer in the lower rear part of the rod a counterclockwise rotating vortex a is born furthermore behind the mcc a new small a vortex appears and the b continues growing both rear vortices are importantly deflected to a lower negative y direction by the gap flow here a shifting of the frontal stagnation pressure to an upper angle is observed in the front of the main cylinder for the ellipse cr the rear a and b vortices are significantly larger than those induced by the square cr and the rear rod a vortex is smaller additionally the detached a vortex decreased in size and it was moved to a distant position at the subsequent instant 3t 4 and the square cr the b vortex is almost detached from the upper primary shear layer and the a a and b vortices continue to grow for the ellipse cr the detached primary a vortex from the lower shear layer has been vanished and it has been replaced with the distorted clockwise vortex b coming from the upper primary shear layer here the growth of the a vortex located behind the mcc created a thick alleyway flow follow the black arrow which in turn canceled out the rear b vortex and distorted the vortex b in the last 4t 4 instant a new vortex b is formed in the upper part of the square rod the a vortex is now almost detached from the gap positive shear layer displacing the b vortex to a farther downstream position and elongating the b vortex for the ellipse cr case the a vortex increased in size and the b vortex was distanced further from the mcc as the wake behind the rod alternated the a vortex has been disappeared and the b vortex was born for the msc the wake patterns induced by either the blunt or the streamlined cr were very different from those of the mcc in fig 19 b and t 4 it is observed how the upper primary shear layer is interrupted by the square rod presence as a consequence its formation length is shortened and the a vortex of the lower primary shear layer is relocated to an upper y position in comparison to the isolated square see fig 18 b such cr interruption separated the upper primary shear layer into two currents the highest one induced the creation of the vortex c detached from the upper part of the cr the lowest current triggers a gap flow formed by two opposite rotating shear layers by flow incidence the gap negative shear layer stretched the length of the b vortex in the cylinders gap throat the positive shear layer compresses the negative one as a consequence the thickness of the negative shear layer that envelopes the upper msc rear corner is reduced causing a decrease of the b vortex size no positive a vortex is visible at the lower face of the msc for the ellipse cr the main wake difference is that the c vortex is not developed as the shape is more streamlined at the second instant 2t 4 the vortex b has increased its size the a vortex has disappeared and the square rod wake has alternated to the c vortex for the ellipse cr the vortex b is bounded by the a vortex located in the lower side of the msc for the square rod and at 3t 4 the b vortex separates from the msc rear forming the vortex b and the direction of the alleyway flow is switched in the lower msc face the a vortex appears and the vortex a located in its corner is elongated excepting for the c vortex the same wake features were observed for the ellipse cr case at the instant 4t 4 the b vortex has been disappeared and the a vortex located near the lower primary shear layer has grown for both cr cases the lateral vortices a and b presented very similar shapes and the c and c wake vortices of the square rod were absent for the ellipse cr as shown in fig 20 for θ 157 5 the impinging flow packages are shielded by the crs and the gap flow has moved near the upper front face of the main cylinders for the mcc and both crs the positive shear layer formed in the cylinders gap compressed the negative one as a result the primary upper shear layer loses some strength and its thickness is decreased in comparison to that of the isolated cylinder this effect is also observed in the formation of smaller b vortices at the instants t 4 and 2t 4 also for both rod cases the detached b vortex visible at 3t 4 is smaller than the counterclockwise a at t 4 this latter indicates that the upwash flow of the lower primary shear layer is more energetic than the downwash motions produced by the primary upper one as a consequence positive lift forces appear between both rods the only difference was given by the barely visible c vortex located in the square cr wake which was not present for the ellipse one for the msc and the square rod at the instants t 4 and 2t 4 the gap flow induced the shrinking of the upper lateral b and the rear b vortices at 3t 4 and 4t 4 no important differences in wake patterns and vortices were found in comparison to those of the isolated square cylinder again the rear square rod c and c vortices were absent for the ellipse cr for this main cylinder geometry the overall wake patterns and vortices in all instants were almost identical to those of the isolated square cylinder the cylinders shear layer evolutions of fig 21 corresponding to θ 180 showed a recovery of flow symmetry and the formation of a cavity flow in the cylinders gap for both main cylinders the direction of the cavity flow switches its direction as the wake is evolving from the c l 0 instant to other state of either maximum or minimum c l where the detached vortices a or b have been vanished for the mcc the wake vortices were very similar to those of the isolated cylinder for the msc and at t 4 the flow packages of the cavity flow are directed to a negative direction weakening the b rear vortex and disappearing the lateral upper b one the same effect was observed in the corresponding lower a and a vortices at 3t 4 as shown in table 7 the vortices generated behind the crs induced the apparition of a secondary oscillating frequency sts in the wake of the main cylinders for the two main geometries this new oscillating frequency was about twice that of the main st for illustrative purposes fig 22 shows the frequency peaks obtained from the fft of the c l signal for the mcc at θ 67 5 3 8 phase diagrams of the main cylinders at different angular locations the mcc and msc phase plots at four distinctive angular locations are shown in fig 23 at θ 0 the mcc presents lower drag forces in comparison to the msc for all cases for the mcc the square cr induced the lowest c d and c l oscillations for the msc case the different crs induced similar lift attenuations and the drag reductions were low again the square cr presented the lowest values of drag coefficient at θ 67 5 the main cylinders are influenced by the apparition of negative repulsive forces and gap flows which depended highly on the geometry of the cr for the msc the magnitudes of c d and c l oscillations were increased drastically by the rods here the c l oscillated mostly between negative at higher levels of drag the highest oscillations were induced by the square cr for the mcc the lift oscillations were highly suppressed and the c d forces were not strongly amplified in fact for the case of the ellipse cr some drag reduction is visible at θ 157 5 and the mcc the crs induced some decrease in the maximum and minimum magnitudes of c l and showed a slight distortion of the coefficients toward negative values which is related to the loss of symmetry of the wake similar decreases in the magnitudes were present for the msc however the distortion effect was not observable for both main cylinders the square rod delivers the highest drag reductions at θ 180 the rods are located in a frontal position shielding the front face of the main cylinders here the rods induced drag decreases and some attenuation of the c l fluctuations the cr geometry was more influential for the msc than for the mcc and the square rod delivers the lowest values in both cases 3 9 the effect of the relative orientation of the control rod the effect of the rod angle β was tested by using the square rod and the main circular cylinder as a representative case the corresponding profiles of the drag and lift coefficients as well as the fluctuating lift and st are shown in fig 24 a d for comparison purposes the square cr at the original angular positions as well as the circular cr were included as shown in fig 24 a excepting for the rear position θ 0 the drag coefficient depended on the rod angle at the other positions here the drag reduction effect was enhanced up to 30 at β 30 and β 60 at the angular position of θ 180 it is noticeable that at θ 67 5 the increase in c d given by the square at the base angle was damped by rotating the rod between 0 and 30 excepting for β 0 at θ 67 5 the lift coefficient values resulted independent of the rod angle for the fluctuating lift coefficient no significant differences in terms of β were found contrastingly the st number was dependent on the rod angle mostly in the rear θ 0 and θ 67 5 locations thus given the dependence on β observed in the drag forces and vortex shedding frequencies this parameter should be further assessed in a future paper the effect β using the other non circular rods and other influential parameters as gap spacing and re will be presented 4 conclusions the influence of the rod geometry in the forces and wake formation of one circular cylinder and other with squared cross section was numerically investigated according to the results for both main cylinders the flow parameters c d c l c l and st were strongly influenced according to three angular intervals representing conditions of the rods immersed in the rear area of the main cylinder 0 θ 45 around its upper face 45 θ 135 and frontally 135 θ 180 in the rear part the c d reductions obtained by both main cylinders were moderate and quite independent on the control rod geometry for the main circular cylinder at θ 0 the c l decreased about 48 using the ellipse and the rectangular rods while for the circular square rods these values decreased up to 58 for the main square cylinder maximum decreases of 68 73 were produced by the circular and square control rods at θ 45 the st of the main circular cylinder was decreased by a maximum of 10 for the square control rod at θ 0 in contrast for the main square cylinder the st increased up to 18 depending on the rod shape in the angular interval of 45 θ 135 significant negative lift forces appear and the c d values increased in this range most of the flow parameters are highly dependent on the rod geometry for the main circular cylinder the maximum value was of c l 0 6 whereas for the main square cylinder the c l value was 1 1 both of them coincided at θ 67 5 in this angle c l value of the main circular cylinder was reduced up to 92 by the square and circular rods in the frontal interval of 135 θ 180 the drag reduction effect is again presented for the main circular cylinder the maximum drag reduction of 30 was produced by the square control rod at θ 157 5 for the main square cylinder the same rod induced a maximum of 24 of drag reduction at θ 180 in this position the c l values of the main circular cylinder were decreased by 21 for the square rod whereas the ellipse induced the lowest decrease of 11 at θ 180 while the st values given by the rods were almost equal to that of the base case those of the main square cylinder increased the different values obtained at the three previous angular intervals obey to different flow characteristics in the rear range given by 0 θ 45 the rods interfere with the natural shedding process of the upper and lower shear layers detached from both main cylinders the drag reduction effect is related to a decrease in the pressure deficit behind the main cylinder given by the rod presence the control rod geometry was moderately influential in most of the parameters and both main cylinders in addition the recirculation regions behind main cylinders were increased and some deficits in the mean streamwise velocity components were observed when the rods were located at the upper face 45 θ 135 the gap flows impinged upon the upper main cylinders faces for the main square cylinder the flow separation is unaltered however for the main circular cylinder the gap flows delayed importantly the upper separation point altering the upper shear layer wake formation and inducing high negative lift forces which depended strongly on the rod geometry the recirculation regions of the main circular cylinders were highly extended inducing hence high decreases in the c l and st coefficients other effects include strong deficits in the streamwise velocity component of the wake and the apparition of additional frequencies given by the new vortices detached from the rods for the main square cylinder the lift forces where higher than those of the main circular cylinder and the fluctuating lift forces were increased this last effect is contrary to that observed for the main circular cylinder finally when the rods were located at 135 θ 180 the drag reduction effect of the main circular cylinder is explained in terms of rod interference and pressure base recovery as some elongation of the mean recirculation region remained the st was also reduced additionally some deficit in the streamwise velocities along the wake line were found independently on the rod geometry for the main square cylinder the rear pressure deficit increased and because the mean recirculation regions were smaller than that of the base case the st increased for both main cylinders the c l values were similar to those of their corresponding base cases in a future work an extensive analysis of the influence of the local rod angle re and gap spacing will be performed credit authorship contribution statement alejandro alonzo garcia conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft visualization supervision

20633,the effects of the control rod geometry on the oscillating forces and vortex shedding of one circular cylinder and another with square cross section were numerically investigated the reynolds number re based on the diameter of the main cylinder d is fixed at 200 the solutions were obtained by applying the finite volume method to the navier stokes in unsteady form the control rods cr geometries are square circular rectangle and ellipse accounting for different degrees of aerodynamic smoothness the gap spacing between the main cylinder and cr was set to 0 2d and their positions were varied in the angular range from θ 0 to θ 180 using intervals of 22 5 for both main cylinders the main flow features fall into three angular intervals representing conditions of the rods immersed in the near wake of the main cylinders located on their upper face and frontally in the first one the fluctuating lift coefficient decreased up to 58 for the main circular cylinder by using a square rod for the main square cylinder the maximum reduction was 73 the second range was characterized by gap flow formations which depended on the rod geometry and increased severely the lift forces at the frontal angular position the drag forces were reduced by rod interference these results have many potential applications in the control of fluid structure interactions since cylinders with either circular or square cross sections are ubiquitous in the engineering field keywords square cylinder circular cylinder laminar flow cfd control rod 1 introduction the study of forces generated in structures composed by cylinders with circular or square cross sections is important in the design of devices such as heat exchangers buildings bridges offshore structures marine drillers underwater pipes just to name a few the importance of the study of fluid structure interactions fsi becomes relevant in the structural integrity design of certain devices since the alternate vortex shedding in the near wake regions may induce fatigue to the element due to vibrational forces or upon entering resonance cause its collapse for a smooth cylinder of infinite length there is a classification of flow regimes as a function of the reynolds number re ρud μ which is defined by the free stream velocity u the fluid density ρ the body diameter d and the kinematic viscosity μ such classification ranges from the creeping flow dominated by viscous forces for re 5 the formation of two symmetric bubbles which grow along the streamwise direction proportionally to the re number at the range 5 re 49 the formation of a laminar oscillating and two dimensional wake at 49 re 140 194 until its subsequent transition to a three dimensional wake in the range 190 re 260 in the latter regime the end effects cause first velocity fluctuations along the spanwise coordinate karniadakis and triantafyllou 1992 and eventually the flow packages move out of phase with each other producing vortex dislocations which trigger the three dimensional vortex street apparition williamson 1989 from here in the interval 260 re 150 10 3 the wake structures present turbulent features being known as the subcritical regime williamson 1996 comprehensive reviews about the flow on a cylinder in its various flow regimes can be found in the works of williamson 1996 zdravkovich 1997 and norberg 2003 regarding the flow over arrays of two or more cylinders the resulting flow patterns are product of complex interactions among the wakes produced by the bodies commonly these are classified using additional parameters such as spacing between cylinders g d the alignment angle θ and the diameter ratio d d which are not present in the flow on an isolated cylinder for the flow over two cylinders of the same diameter a wide variety of works have been reported over the years important reviews of those works have been presented in the works of zdravkovich 1977 sumner 2010 and more recently zhou and mahbub alam 2016 in the last work the flow was classified accordingly to nine distinctive patterns depending on the spacing and angle of attack defined as single bluff body type 1 and 2 base bleed shear layer reattachment induced separation vortex impingement gap vortex pairing and enveloping gap vortex pairing splitting and enveloping and synchronized gap vortex shedding these flow patterns have been identified using visualization techniques and useful design charts have been developed for the averaged drag c d and lift coefficients c l as well as the fluctuating coefficients c d and c l in addition to the fundamental understanding of flow patterns several control methods focused on reducing drag and attenuating or eliminating vortex induced vibrations viv have been studied in general depending on the way they rely on an external energy source to operate the methods of control of blunt body wakes are classified in passive or active open or closed loop choi et al 2008 examples of active control methods for circular cylinders are rotationally oscillating cylinder lee and lee 2008 small rotating control cylinders mittal 2001 zhu and gao 2017 streamwise oscillating foil bao and tao 2013 distributed forcing kim and choi 2005 suction chen et al 2013 synthetic jets wang et al 2016 among others although promising such techniques require additional adjustments of control algorithms for optimal operation as stated by choi et al 2008 and their implementation for practical applications has been recognized as difficult zhu et al 2017 the other type of control is the passive one which does not need an external source of energy to operate for cylinders passive control implementations have commonly been focused on the flow separation and vortex shedding control examples are aligned grooved surfaces alonzo garcía et al 2015 transversal grooves i e cactus shapes by zhdanov and busse 2011 rigid or flexible splitter plates behind cylinder assi and bearman 2015 liang et al 2018 wavy surface lam and lin 2009 free to rotate triangular fairing zhu et al 2017 although simpler than the active control methods these techniques rely on changes or attachments on the cylinder walls an alternative for this latter consists of positioning a small control rod cr around the main cylinder strykowski and sreenivasan 1990 used a circular cr with d d 0 143 to control the flow over a main circular cylinder mcc at re 80 the authors reported a reduction of 20 in c d and linked the effect with partial cancellation of the vorticity ω produced by the shear layers due to rods presence similarly zhao et al 2005 studied the effect of a circular cr on a mcc at the three dimensional wake regime re 500 using a diameter ratio of 0 25 and varying the spacing between 0 05 g d 1 at small spacing g d 0 1 the wake is similar to that of an isolated circular cylinder and the c d values of the arrangement of two cylinders increase at the interval 45 θ 135 in addition given the interstitial flow the lift coefficient c l showed high negative values for other angular positions 0 θ 45 and 135 θ 180 the c d values were decreased and the repulsive forces between cylinders were considerably lower regardless of g d in such cases two mechanisms are recognized one is related to a repositioning of the separation point along the upper surface of the mcc and the other is a consequence of shear layer interference given by the small rod kuo et al 2007 used two crs of d d 0 125 located at a fixed streamwise position x d 0 5 and varied the vertical distance y d 0 6 over the range 80 re 300 it was reported that by the obstruction in the rear region created by the crs and directly related to re there is flow deflection between the cylinders gaps which increases the symmetry of the recirculating region decreases the vorticity levels and delays the main recirculation regions to downstream positions the latter effect is also related to the monotonous decreases of the fluctuating lift and drag forces another work is that of lu et al 2014 who used six circular crs over a mcc evaluating the effect of g d θ and d d in the periodic laminar regime at re 200 four flow regimes were identified and sustained reductions of c d and c l were reported in the range 0 2 g d 2 using a diameter ratio of 0 24 on other hand the square cross section cylinder is a common device used in a wide variety of engineering systems and as stated elsewhere it has not been studied as much as the circular cross section cylinder agrawal et al 2006 breuer et al 2000 chatterjee and biswas 2015 unlike circular cylinders square ones have fixed separation points and present different shedding frequencies pressure distributions and aerodynamic forces successful implementations of crs to control the flow over a main square cylinder msc in the turbulent subcritical regime have been stated in several works chauhan et al 2019 lesage and gartshore 1987 mahbub alam et al 2002 sakamoto et al 1991 sarioglu et al 2005 yen et al 2016 for example lesage and gartshore 1987 reduced the drag and fluctuating forces in the turbulent regime by using a circular cr located at different distances upstream a main cylinder of circular square and rectangular cross section shape the tested range covered the range 1 10 4 re 7 10 4 it was reported the existence of a jump spacing of around g d 2 where maximum drag reduction occurs for the three types of cylinders and the flow switches between two well defined regimes for the msc maximum attenuations of c d and c l of the order of 70 and 90 were obtained sakamoto et al 1991 studied the flow through a circular msc with a circular cr located in positions adjacent to the upper face of the square at re 4 10 4 the modifications in the structure of the shear layer induced by the control cylinder produced reductions in the order of 75 and 95 for the fluctuating draft and lift coefficients also a c d reduction of the order of 30 was reported mahbub alam et al 2002 analyzed the wake through two squares arranged in tandem varying the spacing between cylinders and using a small vertical plate as cr the work was performed at the subcritical regime at re 5 6 10 4 when the spacing between the cr and the first prism is between 1 5 g d 1 9 the alternation of vortices in the wake of the first cylinder is suppressed obtaining significant reductions in c d and c l for the front cylinder the maximum reductions in these parameters were of around 71 and 94 with the reductions for the rear cylinder being of 65 and 80 recently chauhan et al 2019 employed two circular control rods placed symmetrically in the upper and lower faces of the square using the values of re 485 re 805 and re 1290 a maximum drag reduction of 38 was reported at re 1290 when the crs are located in x d 0 5 and y d 0 6 in the same cr location a reduction of 30 in the strouhal number st was also found for the laminar periodic regime this problem seems to be less explored firat et al 2015 analyzed numerically the effect of a circular cr located in front of the msc rotating the assembly between 0 and 90 varying the spacing between 1 g l 4 at re 200 according to the authors when the cr is located in front of the msc and at g l 3 the c d could be reduced up to 46 whereas the c l about 68 according to the above extensive efforts have been made to study the suppression of hydrodynamic forces on mcc or msc for separated commonly in these works one or more circular rods or small vertical flat plates were used for the msc most of works have been made at the subcritical regime whereas the laminar flow has not been deeply explored also regardless of the geometry of the main cylinder to the authors knowledge a systematic study focused on the effect of the cr geometry on the flow over a blunt body at the laminar regime had not been attempted before in this sense it is known that the cr wake depends on its cross section and re number derakhshandeh and alam 2019 therefore rods of different shapes are expected to produce distinctive perturbations which in turn alter the main cylinder vortex street evolution and oscillating forces the main objective of this work is to assess the effect of the rod geometry in the flow over a main cylinder with either circular or square cross section as both geometries are ubiquitous in the engineering field four cr geometries are tested by considering gradual variations of their aerodynamic smoothness these are square fixed separation points and wide wake circular movable separations point and wide wake rectangle fixed separation points and narrow wake and the ellipse movable separation points and narrow wake the research was performed re 200 to provide more insight about the control effects in the periodic laminar regime the simulations were validated using experimental data and simulations for the isolated circular and square cylinder cases from other works also the flow over a main circular cylinder with a circular cr at different angular locations was used for comparison the information presented here can be used to optimize flow control through a cr of certain geometry on different devices operating on a laminar regime as most of the works of control by cylinders have been made with circular rods the results presented herein are promising for future analysis in the turbulent regime and in other applications related to heat transfer control 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations the flow is assumed to be two dimensional unsteady incompressible laminar and newtonian the governing equations for this type of fluids are expressed by the two dimensional navier stokes n s eqs 1 2b continuity 1 u x x u y y 0 momentum 2a u x t u x u x x u y u x y p x 1 r e 2 u x x 2 2 u x y 2 2b u y t u x u y x u y u y y p y 1 r e 2 u y x 2 2 u y y 2 in those equations u x u y are the dimensionless velocity components along x and y directions of a cartesian coordinate system and p is the pressure the time averaged drag and lift coefficients are defined by eqs 3 and 4 being f d and f l the time averaged drag and lift forces d represent the largest cylinder diameter u denotes the free stream velocity and ρ is the fluid density 3 c d f d 1 2 ρ u 2 d 4 c l f l 1 2 ρ u 2 d in eqs 3 and 4 the time averaged drag and lift forces are defined by eqs 5

location upstream the pair of cylinders 2 2 computational domain and boundary conditions the simulations were performed using the fluent v 15 0 implicit pressure based solver which applies the finite volume method to solve the n s equations as shown in fig 1 a the computational domain was a square of 40d 40d which was based according to the recommendations stated on the works of kumar and mittal 2006 and lu et al 2014 all grids were composed of triangular cells at the inlet a dirichlet boundary condition bc u x u u y 0 was imposed while a pressure outlet bc was set for the outlet of the computational domain the non slip bc u x 0 u y 0 was imposed on cylinder walls and symmetry was employed on the upper and lower faces of the domain the pressure velocity coupling was performed by using the piso algorithm the spatial discretization was performed by a second order upwind scheme for the momentum equations whereas the standard algorithm was used for the pressure the temporal terms were treated with a bounded second order implicit scheme in the cylinder simulations which include a cr the angle between the positive x axis and the center of the control rods was denoted by θ which for all simulations varied from 0 to 180 using intervals of 22 5 as shown in fig 1 b four rod geometries were tested for each main cylinder these control rods were defined in terms of the characteristic length d shown in fig 2 and they were inspired on common engineering shapes of easy manufacture regarding the gap distance g between either the mcc or the msc and the small rod it was fixed to g d 0 2 being the diameter ratio of d d 0 25 from such a cylinder ratio the re of the crs have values around 50 thus two dimensional laminar vortex shedding is expected in the rear zones of the rods these spacing and diameter ratio have been previously associated to drag reduction in a mcc by means of one circular control rod by zhao et al 2005 2 3 mesh independence analysis to verify a grid independent solution four grids ranging from 44 5 103 to 399 103 cells were used to solve the base case of the flow over an isolated circular cylinder at the 2d unsteady wake regime re 200 in all simulations the computational time step δt was fixed according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criteria using an empirical safe coefficient c t 0 2 to assure stability on the predictions in eq 11 s e represents the area of the smallest mesh cell and u is the mean stream velocity 11 t c t m i n s e u each time step was solved with a convergence criterion of 1 10 6 in the continuity and flow velocities u x and u y and it was reached within 30 sub iterations in all simulations the time averaged results were obtained from data collected from at least 8 residence times collected after wake development as shown in table 1 the overall sizes for both the total number of cells and nodal count n uniformly imposed along the cylinder walls were sequentially doubled in order to avoid false spatial convergence especially in the near wall calculations in all grids the proximity and curvature algorithm of the ansys meshing software was applied starting from the value of 1 03 for the m1 grid the growth rate values were decreased to 1 01 in the m3 and m4 grids to obtain a smooth refinement near the cylinder walls the average and maximum skewness levels of the resulting grids were lower than the 0 33 and 0 95 values recommended in the ansys fluent user s guide ansys fluent v 12 0 2009 some details of the near cylinder regions are shown in fig 3 according to the results of the mean c d and the amplitude of the lift coefficient c l a shown in table 1 the percentage difference between m3 and m4 grids was of 0 4 for the c d 0 15 for the c l a and 0 051 for the st the grid convergence index gci is a conservative estimator of uncertainty between grids and it was calculated according to the procedure for non uniform grids reported by celik and karatekin 1997 using the m2 m3 and m4 grids solutions the resulting uncertainty values for c d and c l a were 0 31 and 0 13 between the m3 and m4 grids accordingly the m3 grid was considered as the outline for all other runs in order to alleviate the computational time needed for every run for this grid the minimum wall distance was of δy min 0 0051 which is around the 0 004 value used by kumar de and dalal 2006 and lower than the half of the 0 0115 value used by linnick and fasel 2005 2 4 validation of the numerical model with other literature data 2 4 1 fluid flow past an isolated circular cylinder and a square cylinder firstly it was validated the numerical model comparing the c d c l a and st by simulating the flow over an isolated circular cylinder at re 200 and comparing the results with available data from other works as shown in table 2 deviations smaller than 2 3 were found for c d in comparison to the implicit forced immersed boundary method ibm simulations performed by le et al 2008 which was the case that exhibited the largest difference in values for c l a a difference around 4 was found in comparison to the cell boundary element method cell bem performed by farrant et al 2000 see c l a 0 71 versus c l a 0 68 of the results reported in this work the non dimensional vortex shedding frequency st was slightly overestimated also by about 4 in comparison to the ibm simulations of le et al 2008 for the other works the differences were lower than 2 for the three assessed parameters thus the present results are considered in fair agreement with previously reported data another case used for validation purposes was the laminar flow past an isolated squared cylinder with unsteady wake to compare directly our results to other available data the simulation was performed at re 100 and the predicted results of c d c l and st are summarized in table 3 for the c d a maximum difference of 3 3 in comparison to the work of lam et al 2012 was found the fluctuating lift coefficient deviated about 5 5 from those of the works of kumar de and dalal 2006 and lam et al 2012 which applied the finite volume method finally for st the maximum deviation was 5 0 and corresponded to the work of breuer et al 2000 the differences of st between the work of breuer et al 2000 and those presented by other researchers might be caused by the higher conditions of blockage bl as well as the use of a parabolic velocity profile at the inlet in this sense the other works applied uniform inlet velocity profiles 2 4 2 fluid flow past two circular cylinders with different angles of attack furthermore the numerical model is validated considering an arrangement of a mcc and circular cr at re 500 for different θ positions such increase in re allows analyzing the response of our models in the onset of a turbulent wake which in our case may be generated by the local acceleration existent in the gap between cylinders for some particular cr shape also the nature of the repulsive forces could be assessed in this case the cr was discretized by using nd d 50 cells uniformly disposed in its periphery similarly to the work of lu et al 2014 the same discretization remained for the other cr geometries discussed in the results section fig 4 shows the comparison of c d and c l obtained using g d 0 2 with the works of zhao et al 2005 and lu et al 2014 a good correspondence between the results presented here and those works is shown the numerical model was able to replicate fairly well the wake interference caused by the cr at 0 θ 80 and the delay of the separation point induced when the cr is located in the frontal positions of the main cylinder in the range 124 θ 180 both mechanisms were associated to drag reduction in the main cylinder by zhao et al 2005 regarding the lift force the model reproduced the c l 0 in θ 0 and θ 180 which are related to the cr located either in the front part or in the rear part of the main cylinder also a negative lift at 67 5 θ 135 was present the maximum difference in c d was 3 8 at θ 45 in comparison to the work of zhao et al 2005 and 18 in c l at θ 90 a better agreement was achieved with the work of lu et al 2014 as the differences at the same angular positions were 2 7 and 4 9 for c d and c l respectively from the analysis above it was demonstrated the good agreement between the present results and other data from literature for the isolated circular and isolated square cases also the drag reduction effect induced by a circular cr located at certain θ was fairly reproduced even for re 500 which is related to turbulent wake structures at distant streamwise positions 2 4 3 the influence of the re number in the solutions for both main cylinder geometries it is recognized from the literature that some three dimensional features may not be captured in two dimensional simulations as the reynolds number of 200 may be considered strictly transitional therefore additional runs were performed at re 160 for the isolated circular cylinder and the mcc and a square cr at θ 67 5 the comparison of the results in terms of time averaged streamlines and dimensionless z vorticity patterns ω ω z d u between re 160 and re 200 are shown in fig 5 no significant differences were observed between the resulting flow patterns moreover as shown in table 4 for the isolated circular cylinder at re 200 the differences between the present results for st and c d and those of rajani et al 2009 who used 3d domains were below 3 this agreement is explained by considering that the reynolds number of 200 barely exceeded the value for the onset of the mode a instability which according to williamson 1989 appears at re 190 and it is not characterized by fine scale vortices furthermore for the mcc and the square cr the values of c d c l and st between both re were very similar confirming the notion that the results obtained for re 200 were not strongly influenced by the lack of the third spatial component of the domains further simulations were applied for the main square cylinder in this case the isolated square cylinder and the msc with a circular rod at θ 157 5 at re 100 were used as representative as shown in table 5 good agreement is observed between the present results and those reported by berrone et al 2011 for the isolated square case at both reynolds numbers although not shown here for brevity no significant differences in terms of flow patterns were also obtained for the representative cases between the two reynolds numbers at both re the msc with a circular rod case presented a drag reduction of about 13 15 depending on the re an increase of lift and similar st values thus for the msc the overall tendencies obtained at re 200 were considered as representative of the unsteady two dimensional wake regime 3 results 3 1 analysis of the main cylinders drag and lift coefficients as a function of θ the c d and c l for the mcc obtained at different θ positions from the tested crs are shown in fig 6 a and c for comparison purposes those corresponding to the msc are shown in fig 6 b and d at θ 0 the crs are fully immersed behind the main cylinder wake for the mcc the square cr induced a minimum value of c d 1 19 which is about 12 lower than the c d 1 35 of the isolated circular cylinder dashed line the drag reduction obtained by using the ellipse cr was modest and it was of around 8 the c d obtained by using the other two cr geometries were bounded by those values at θ 22 5 the tendency remained the same although all crs caused lower decreases of c d at θ 45 the c d value obtained by using the square cr almost reached that of the isolated cylinder whereas a slight drag reduction of about 7 was induced by the circular cr when the control rods were closer to the region where the upper primary shear layer is detached in 67 5 θ 90 the c d values were strongly influenced by the cr geometry while the ellipse cr induced about 10 in drag reduction at θ 67 5 the c d obtained using a square cr increased up to 12 6 here the mcc c d values produced by the rectangle and circular rods were close to the base case value at θ 112 5 the c d values were almost independent on the cr shape and no significant drag reductions or increases were observed as the crs are moved to frontal locations in the range of 135 θ 180 the most significant decreases in drag were observed at θ 157 5 a decrease of the order of 30 of c d was given by the square cr while about 22 5 was achieved the circular and the rectangular rods at the same θ the ellipse cr induced moderated decreases in drag in comparison to the other rods however this geometry presented a sustained drag reduction effect in almost all the θ positions being its maximum decrease of 17 at θ 180 for the msc case shown in fig 6 b when the crs are located in the rear part of the square at θ 22 5 slight drag reductions around 3 were obtained regardless of the cr geometry on the other hand in the range 45 θ 135 that is when the crs are located around the upper side of the cylinder the c d increased strongly in all cases the maximum value of 40 is given by the square cr at θ 67 5 while the lowest increase of 12 4 was produced by the ellipse cr thus at those angular locations the rod geometry is highly influential on the drag increase in the frontal region of the msc at 157 5 θ 180 all rods induced drag reduction at θ 180 the square cr induced a maximum drag reduction of c d of 24 in the same position a minimum decrease of 14 was obtained by using the ellipse cr the drag coefficients of the rectangle and circular crs were almost identical being about 17 lower than the base case value similarly to the mcc the ellipse cr induced the most moderated decreases or increases of c d in all angular locations by comparing fig 6 a and b in all θ range the msc coefficients were larger in comparison to those of the mcc as the body is less streamlined zhao et al 2005 explained the drag reduction by a circular cr at small angular locations i e θ 45 in terms of interference in the primary shear layers rolling up which takes place from the top and bottom walls of the main cylinder according to our results for the msc the cr geometry has a moderate impact on the drag reduction on the other hand at the frontal positions 135 θ 180 the drag reduction is a consequence of the shielding effect induced by the cr presence for the mcc this latter effect was found to be more dependent on the cr geometry especially at θ 157 5 the time averaged c l coefficients of both main cylinders are shown in fig 6 c and d in the angular positions θ 0 and θ 180 the wake is symmetric in the y direction and the c l 0 for both main cylinders as the crs are rotated in the range 45 θ 112 5 important repulsive forces arose as a consequence of a gap flow formation inducing negative lift coefficients on both main cylinders the maximum negative values of c l 0 6 for the mcc and c l 1 1 for the msc coincided with the square cr located at θ 67 5 independently of their shapes the rods produced a positive lift peak of around c l 0 1 in both main cylinders when located at θ 22 5 for the mcc a second positive peak of similar magnitude is observed at θ 157 5 corresponding to the crs located near the frontal part of the main cylinder similar positive peaks were also found by zhao et al 2005 3 2 the r m s of the cl and st of the main cylinders as a function of θ the fluctuating lift coefficient c l at the different θ positions obtained for the mcc and msc are shown in fig 7 a and b for the mcc all crs produced a sustained reduction of fluctuating lift when the crs were located in the rear part of the mcc at θ 0 the c l was decreased in around 48 using the ellipse and the rectangular rods here the values produced by the square and circular rods were 58 lower than the base case value at θ 22 5 the fluctuating coefficients of the different crs increased and the values presented some dispersion at θ 45 the c l of the mcc becomes highly dependent on the cr geometry excepting for the ellipse cr which produced an increase of c l from 0 35 at θ 22 5 to 0 40 at θ 45 the other rods decreased the c l values here a maximum reduction of about 75 of c l was given by the circular cr for all cases the maximum decreases of 88 92 were obtained when the small rods were immersed on the upper shear layer formation region at θ 67 5 it is noticeable that at this angular position the c d and c l values were highly dependent on the cr geometry but it was not the case for c l in the range 90 θ 180 the c l values were recovered and moderate influence on the cr geometry was observed at θ 180 the crs are located in front of the mcc without any interaction with the wake formation region in this position the highest decrease of 21 was induced by the square rod whereas the lowest decrease of 11 was produced by the ellipse rod for the msc case decreases in the c l were observed when the crs were located in the square rear at 0 θ 45 and at the frontal position θ 180 for the latter angles excepting for θ 45 the c l values were similar for all rods at θ 112 5 the circular and ellipse crs were capable to decrease the fluctuating forces the maximum decreases of around 68 73 were obtained for the circular and square crs at θ 45 at the same θ the rectangular cr decreased the c l by about 40 the ellipse cr presented the minimum c l value at θ 112 5 and it was 42 lower than the base case in contrast to the mcc case increases of the fluctuating lift forces were obtained in the positions θ 67 5 θ 90 and θ 135 which depended on the cr geometry being especially larger for the square rod for the latter geometry the c l increased more than 100 at θ 135 at this angular position the most streamlined rod ellipse cr induced a 50 of increase in the c l although not desirable for purposes of mitigation of viv the latter increases in the fluctuating lift forces may find some applications on energy harvester devices composed of oscillating slender cylinders chizfahm et al 2018 excepting for the cases where the crs were located directly in front of the mcc at θ 180 the st showed a dependency on the shape of the crs for the other angular locations all rod shapes induced minimum st values at θ 90 which coincided with the crs vertically aligned with the mcc the maximum decreases of st were bounded between the maximum of 25 given by the square cr and a minimum of 17 induced by the elliptic one for the mcc and this re the location of a cr in the range 67 5 θ 157 5 is favorable for st reduction purposes note that at θ 67 5 the c l values are also importantly attenuated and even a slight drag reduction was given by the ellipse cr about 10 for the msc the highest st attenuations were present at θ 135 for all cases which corresponded to angular shifting from the θ 90 present for the mcc to a frontal angular position here the largest decreases were produced by the square and circular crs being of 21 and 18 respectively in contrast to the mcc at the frontal position θ 0 the st of the msc increased between 12 and 18 depending on the rod shape 3 3 the total drag and lift coefficients of the two cylinder system the total drag and lift coefficients c d arr and c l arr obtained for the system of both cylinders are shown in fig 8 a and b they were calculated by adding the contribution of the mean averaged force of the corresponding cr and using d d as the equivalent diameter in eqs 3 and 4 for the mcc the total drag coefficients increased in the range 67 5 θ 135 forming a semi parabolic profile this is because at those θ locations the free flow impinges directly upon the crs causing additional positive contributions to the total drag force the values of the arrangements mcc and circular and square crs were maximum at θ 90 the corresponding values for these cylinder arrangements surpassed the base case value by 13 and 22 respectively at θ 0 the crs are fully immersed in the near wake formation region where pressure values are negative as a consequence the drag forces generated on the crs are opposite to the flow direction and the c d arr values were lower in comparison to those corresponding to c d shown in fig 6 a at this position the c d arr values were decreased about 30 regardless of the rod geometry at the frontal position θ 180 the c d arr values corresponding to all crs were 26 below the base case value for all angular positions the c d arr of the system mcc and ellipse cr showed a sustained drag reduction effect for the msc the c d arr values induced by the square circular and rectangle crs exceeded the base case value in the range 67 5 θ 135 for the msc and square cr arrangement the total drag was linearly attenuated from the maximum of c d arr 2 07 at θ 67 5 until c d arr 1 75 at θ 135 for the arrangements given by the rectangle and ellipse crs the c d arr profiles were flatter no significant increases of the c d arr were present for the arrangement msc and ellipse cr at θ 0 the total drag forces were decreased further about 25 vs 3 discussed in fig 6 b as the cr mean forces acted oppositely to the mean flow direction at θ 180 maximum drag reductions of about 30 were obtained for all arrangements almost independently on the cr shape excepting for θ 0 and θ 180 the overall repulsive lift forces experienced by the small rods are positive as a consequence the total negative lift coefficients in the range 45 θ 90 have smaller magnitudes than the corresponding c l plotted in fig 8 c and d for the mcc the total lift values are positive at θ 112 5 contrary to the negative values of c l in the same position this is because the positive lift contribution of the rods surpassed the negative repulsive force exerted over the main cylinder accounted for in c l the same effect but at θ 135 was observed in the c l arr of the msc arrangements as expected from the additional positive lift forces from rods the mcc c l arr values at θ 135 and θ 157 5 were higher than those of c l a similar effect was observed for the msc 3 4 time averaged pressure coefficient along the periphery of the cylinder from the previous section it could be seen that the dimensionless numbers are strongly influenced by the rod angular location to perform further analysis three significant angular intervals for the rod location were defined the first range 0 θ 45 represents conditions of the control rod immersed in the rear wake of the main cylinders in the second range given by 45 θ 135 the cr is located around the upper face of the main cylinder and in the third range 135 θ 180 the cr is located frontally figs 9 and 10 show the pressure coefficients obtained in the periphery of the mcc and msc for the crs located at the rear θ 0 in the upper face θ 67 5 θ 157 5 and frontally at θ 180 at θ 0 the base pressure behind the mcc was recovered as a consequence of the rod presence in the frontal angular positions close to the stagnation point at α 180 there were no differences in values regarding to the base case the decrease in the pressure deficit of the mcc rear is explained by considering that in such location the crs are immersed directly in the near wake formation region in this sense as the shedding takes place the flow packages which pass through the gap spacing between cylinders pressurize the rear part of the large cylinder by the formation of a gap flow and induce a negative drag in the small rod in the position θ 67 5 the crs were immersed in the formation region of the primary upper shear layer in this position the values of c l and st were highly attenuated while the c l values increased for the mcc excepting for the ellipse cr the other rod geometries induced increases of the c d values in the lower rear part of the mcc at 270 α 360 the base pressure raised the most moderate increase was given by the square cr in the upper rear part of the mcc at 0 α 50 the values of c p decayed here the c p 1 2 and c p 1 0 values of the square and circular rods were lower than the base case value from there pressures suffer a steep increase that persisted until α 180 producing two peculiar and opposite effects on drag that is at α 90 the pressure increases favoring drag reduction as the rear mcc pressure deficit is attenuated see dashed circle 1 in fig 9 b however at 90 α 180 the effect is contrary since now the pressure components are acting in the flow direction between these effects the second one dominates since in the frontal region i e the range 135 α 180 see dashed circle 2 the cosine components of c p which are acting directly in the x direction are larger than those around 45 α 90 on the other hand the sine components of c p acting on the upper face of the mcc at 67 5 α 135 induced high negative lift forces as they are larger than those acting oppositely at 225 α 292 5 when the crs are moved to a frontal position at θ 157 5 the c p profiles were asymmetric and almost independent on the rod geometry the base pressures suffered moderate recoveries of about 10 in the rear part of the mcc 0 α 90 and 270 α 360 for all cases because the crs shielded the pressures exerted on the front upper face of the mcc the drag forces were decreased at θ 180 the crs shielding effect in the range 157 α 203 is even more evident and again similar base pressure recoveries are produced the corresponding c p distributions for the msc at the same angular cr locations described for the mcc are shown in fig 10 at θ 0 the upper down and rear faces exhibited pressure deficits characterized by negative c p values as they are now fully immersed in the near wake formation two negative minimum peaks of about c p 2 25 coincided with the upper and lower vertices d and f of the front face where the flow is separated from there the pressures were gradually recovered until the c p 0 74 of the rear face h a b independently of their geometries the crs induced moderate pressure increases in the upper lower and rear walls at θ 67 5 the upper wall increased its pressure levels by the gap flow formation which explains the negative high lifts of fig 6 d also along the rear face h a b the pressure deficits were increased by rod presence at θ 157 5 the h a b rear pressure levels were the same as those of the base case however by flow interference the rods induced decreases of c p in the front msc face which in turn attenuated the msc drag forces at θ 180 the front face pressures were further decreased and the base pressures were slightly recovered independently of the cr geometry to assess comparatively the base pressure recovery induced by the rods fig 11 shows the ratio between the base pressures of the main cylinders at certain cr angular location c pb cr with their corresponding isolated cases here c pb mcc stands for the base pressure of the isolated circular cylinder whereas c pb msc refers to that for the isolated square one from fig 11 a all crs reduced the base pressure deficit in the mcc independently on their θ locations the values of c pb cr c pb mcc depended on the cr shape in the rear θ 0 and θ 67 5 cr locations the pressure deficits were reduced by a maximum of about 24 for the square cr at θ 0 and 25 for the ellipse cr at θ 67 5 at the other angular positions such dependence is small as now the crs are located in front of the main cylinder for the msc shown in fig 11 b it was observed a different behavior at θ 67 5 the pressure deficit surpassed in all cases the value given by the isolated square and they were influenced by the cr geometry the maximum pressure deficit was produced by the square cr being about 55 larger than that of the isolated cylinder in the other angular locations the ratios were almost independent on the cr shape and the decrease of pressure deficit was moderated the maximum decrease of around 12 was given by the square cr at θ 180 3 5 time averaged streamlines for the main circular and main square cylinders and cr models the time averaged streamlines patterns for the mcc and msc are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively for the cases where the flow is symmetric at θ 0 and θ 180 the two main recirculation bubbles defined by the shedding of the upper and lower shear layers were elongated along the streamwise direction also two new recirculation bubbles of low velocities were visible in the gap spacing between the mcc and the crs at θ 0 these recirculation bubbles represent regions where the vortex shedding is obstructed and repulsive forces that pressurized the rear cylinder appeared at θ 67 5 the flow symmetry has been lost and the bubbles were relocated an interstitial flow is visible in the spacing between mcc and cr this gap flow altered the vortex shedding process and shifted the upper separation and the stagnation point of the main cylinder in this angular position the flow features presented some resemblance to the base bleeding regime reported by sumner et al 2000 for two circular cylinders of the same diameter the recirculation regions induced by the square circular and rectangular rods were similar and they were defined by four bubbles as it is shown in the inset of fig 12 one large bubble 1 was visible behind each cr and two asymmetric ones 2 and 3 were visible on the lower rear part of the mcc in all cases the fourth bubble was located at a more distant position 4 at about x d 2 5 y d 0 5 for the flow patterns induced by the ellipse cr one of the two recirculation bubbles located at the rear of the mcc was not present and the remaining one 2 was larger and redirected in the streamwise direction also as this rod geometry has the most streamlined shape the bubble 1 located behind the rod is smaller and deflected in comparison to the other crs another difference is that the furthest bubble 3 is now located at a lower vertical position at x d 2 y d 0 25 these changes pointed out differences between the shear layer interactions given by the ellipse cr and the others at θ 157 5 the high velocity gap flow is located near the upper front face of the mcc injecting momentum to the upper main recirculation bubble which is now elongated and larger in comparison to the lower one and that of the base case for the more streamlined crs the lower main recirculation bubble is not formed at θ 180 the crs are located directly in front of the mcc and the flow impinged upon the main cylinder is shielded and the flow patterns showed resemblance to the cavity flow mode reported by prasad and williamson 1997 and tsutsui and igarashi 2002 at the subcritical regime the upper and lower separation points α 1 and α 2 as well as the angle of the stagnation point α 0 obtained for the mcc and the crs are shown in table 6 at θ 0 no important delay or anticipation of the separation points was observed and the values were similar to that of the base case as a consequence of the gap flow formation at θ 67 5 the upper separation point was notably delayed from the 70 5 value of the isolated circular cylinder for the square circular and rectangle the values were between α 1 13 6 and α 1 15 4 whereas for the ellipse cr the angle was of α 1 32 1 as the gap flow direction was different from the others the angles of the lower separation point α 2 were not highly affected besides the square cr induced shifting of the stagnation point from α 0 180 to an upper position of α 0 172 8 the other rods presented shifting variations lower than 3 5 this movement of the stagnation points is also related to the high negative lift forces shown in fig 6 c at the frontal position θ 157 5 the upper separation angle was delayed by about 10 2 for the square cylinder and 8 3 for the rectangle and ellipse crs the effect on the stagnation point is opposite as now it has been shifted to a lower position inducing at the same time a retardation of the lower separation point α 2 as a consequence the lift forces experienced by the mcc are now positive when the crs were located at the frontal position θ 180 some delay of the separation points of around 3 5 were present for the square circular and rectangle crs which are related to a lower pressure deficit in the rear cylinder part and the drag reduction effect as shown in fig 13 for the msc and at θ 0 the recirculation bubbles were the same as those of the isolated case that is two symmetric bubbles were located on the rear part between cylinders and two other ones at the upper and lower faces however similarly to the mcc two additional and smaller bubbles appeared in the gap spacing between cylinders for the msc they induced a lower deficit recovery of the base pressure in comparison to the mcc by considering that the shear layers of an isolated square are more elongated in comparison to those of the circular cylinder at re 200 derakhshandeh and alam 2019 the control rods were possibly located in a region where the shear layers had lower kinetic energy compared to the mcc case weakening the vortex shedding interference effect at the rear location θ 67 5 the gap flow between cylinders interrupted the formation length of the upper face vortex and injected additional momentum into the upper shear layer for the square and circular crs this additional momentum decomposed the upper rear bubble into two vortices whereas for the more streamlined crs the same upper bubble was only distorted in all cases the lower main bubble 3 was shifted to a downstream position and it was smaller than that of the base case at the frontal position θ 157 5 the gap flow decreased the size of the bubble attached in the upper face of the msc this is especially noticeable for the square and circular crs also the upper rear bubbles were slightly elongated along the flow direction almost independently of the cr shape at θ 180 the thickness and sizes of the bubbles attached to the upper and lower msc faces were decreased importantly for the square cr also the frontal msc faces were shielded from flow impingement some additional detail of the upper and lower bubbles attached on msc faces as well as the interference effect in terms of the magnitude of velocity are presented in fig 14 the area covered by the mean recirculation bubbles a cr in proportion to the corresponding main cylinder cross section area a cs is presented in fig 15 here the a r values were extracted from the time averaged streamlines of figs 12 and 13 for the mcc in the rear positions θ 0 and θ 67 5 the a r values were significantly larger in comparison to the base case at θ 0 the a r value of the square cr was two times larger in comparison to the isolated cylinder however the largest values were present at θ 67 5 where the a r given by the circular cr was 5 times larger in comparison to the base case by considering that the regions influenced by the shear layer motions were considerably extended slower shedding motions are expected which are reflected in the low values of st shown in fig 7 c in the frontal θ 157 5 and θ 180 locations the a r increases were not as large as those of the rear position and in general they were independent of the cr shape for the msc the largest a r values were present at θ 0 independent on the cr geometry the recirculation regions were about 40 larger than the base case value at θ 67 5 the circular cr induced an increase of 25 whereas the a r values given by the rectangle and square crs were similar to the 2 05 value of the base case at θ 157 5 the increases were moderated while at 180 the recirculation regions were slightly decreased in all cr cases note that in θ 180 the st of fig 7 d increased 3 6 mean velocity profiles along the wake centerline for the mcc and msc the time averaged dimensionless u x profiles obtained at the wake centerline at y d 0 for several angular cr locations and the mcc are shown in fig 16 at θ 0 the wake velocities suffered a sustained decrease in the range of 1 0 x d 5 0 in comparison to the isolated cylinder profile the lowest velocities were produced by the square cr and the highest were obtained for the rectangular cr the profiles obtained for the mcc and the circular and ellipse crs were similar also for all cr cases small plateaus of near zero velocity were found in the gap spacing between cylinders at x d 1 0 other effects included elongations of the rear recirculation length visible in the points where velocity passes from negative to positive i e x d 1 7 2 2 depending on the cr and higher peak values of negative velocity note that the recirculation length is a measure of the mean wake elongation along the x direction and it is different from the parameter a r discussed early at θ 67 5 the gap flow disrupted the near rear wall vortex formation region the profiles induced by the square circular and rectangle rods were very similar as a consequence of the gap flow see inset of fig 16 b there were positive velocities with maximums ranging from u x u 0 25 0 28 depending on the rod shape at the location x d 1 0 this latter was not the case for the ellipse cr as the gap flow is redirected the same line passes now through a negative velocity zone all cases presented deficits of velocity in the regions 2 0 x d 5 0 when the crs are located now in the frontal mcc positions θ 157 5 and θ 180 similar velocity deficits were observed in the range of 1 0 x d 5 0 however the profiles were almost independent of the cr shape note that at these positions the c d values were higher than those found at the rear θ 0 and θ 67 5 suggesting that the shielding effect dominates for such purposes as shown in fig 17 for the msc similar wake profiles were found between the crs at the four tested angular locations at θ 0 the profiles exhibited a velocity plateau at 0 5 x d 1 0 also the crs produced an elongation in the recirculation length at 0 5 x d 2 5 and moderate velocity deficits in the range 1 5 x d 5 0 here the negative peak values of u x u 0 34 were closer than the u x u 0 30 value of the base case in general these effects were less pronounced than those observed for the mcc at θ 67 5 now the base case profile presents the highest negative peak values and the recirculation lengths of the cr cases were shorter additionally the rods caused a velocity recovery in the range of 0 5 x d 5 5 at the downstream positions x d 6 5 excepting for the ellipse cr the other rods induced velocity deficits in this angular location all crs induced drag increases when the crs were located at the frontal positions θ 157 5 and θ 180 the wake profiles were almost identical between crs cases and showed slight velocity deficits at x d 3 5 3 7 vortex shedding features of the two main cylinders at significant angular locations the temporal evolution of dimensionless z vorticity ω ω z d u and streamlines corresponding to one period of vortex shedding at the cr locations of θ 0 θ 67 5 θ 157 5 and θ 180 are shown in figs 18 21 in the frontal and rear cr angular positions θ 0 and θ 180 the time averaged flow patterns exhibited low dependence on the cr geometry for both main cylinders see i e that the mean wake is symmetric at such angles in figs 12 and 13 furthermore as the square cr induced the lowest c d and c d arr values in both main cylinders it was selected as representative cr in the analysis of the wake formation originated in the main cylinders in the intermediate rear and frontal positions at θ 67 5 and θ 157 5 parameters as c l arr and the c p and c f distributions were strongly dependent on the cr geometry moreover the values of such parameters were bounded between the values given by the square and ellipse rods accordingly such geometries were chosen to depict the mcc and msc wake formations at these positions for comparison purposes in fig 18 a and b are included the wake formations of the isolated circular and isolated square cylinders for all cases the wake formation is defined by two primary shear layers of opposite signs which roll up alternately starting in the first quarter of the period t 4 c l 0 the primary positive vortex a created by the lower shear layer rotating anticlockwise is detached from the isolated circular cylinder in the upper main cylinder rear part a small upper vortex b is rotating in the clockwise direction and it is connected with the a through an alleyway flow as shown in the arrow path at the location of maximum c l at 2t 4 the upper primary shear layer has been elongated and the a vortex is absent now the b vortex has grown significantly covering most of the cylinder rear part below this vortex it is located a small anticlockwise vortex a at 3 4t and 4 4t the flow characteristics are the same as those of t 4 and 2t 4 but the vortices have opposite senses of rotations and locations when the cr is present the alleyway flows shown in t 4 and 3t 4 are redirected as a consequence the smaller vortices a and b are grown and extended along the cr and the main detached vortices a and b are shifted to downstream locations at 2t 4 and 4t 4 the b and a vortices attached on the rear cylinder fully enveloped the small rod and were larger in comparison to those of the isolated cylinder for the msc the separation points are fixed to the corners of its front face forming two new vortices on the cylinder upper and lower faces depicted as a and b the resulting shear layers and primary a and b vortices of the msc are more elongated and wide in comparison to those of the mcc at the time t 4 the small clockwise b neighbor to the rear upper msc face has a less rounded shape in comparison to that of the mcc at 2t 4 the vortex b grows and the b vortex covers a larger part of the upper square face now the lower face clockwise vortex a is almost detached from the square at the later instants 3t 4 and 4t 4 the wake evolves in symmetrical form the overall effects induced by the square cr were similar to those discussed for the mcc in the instant t 4 the upper secondary vortex b is elongated over the upper rod face causing an offset in the alleyway flow this effect brings in turn a shifting of the detached a vortex to a further downstream location at 2t 4 the b vortex grows enveloping fully the square rod at the same time the a vortex is almost detached from the lower corner at the instants 3t 4 and 4t 4 the same wake features were visible but now driven by their corresponding opposite rotating vortices as shown in fig 19 a and b when the rods are rotated at θ 67 5 the flow symmetry has been lost at the different instants of the wake evolution each cr develop its characteristic wake and new vortices of different sizes appear and interact creating complex wake structures for the mcc and t 4 the ellipse cr induced an important elongation of the lower primary shear layer in comparison to that of the isolated cylinder although more moderated the same effect was visible for the square cr in the spacing between cylinders there are two shear layers of opposite signs which divert the flow differently for the square cr the gap shear layers injected additional momentum to the lower primary shear layer causing the relocation of the detached counterclockwise vortex a to a further downstream position here the negative gap shear layer covered almost the upper half of the mcc and moved down the small b vortex to a lower y coordinate the latter effect is reflected in the important delay of the upper separation point α 1 discussed previously in section 3 5 for the square circular and rectangle crs for the mcc and the ellipse cr such negative shear layer not only relocated the small b vortex but also created an extended alleyway flow on the other hand the positive gap shear layer induced flow motions almost parallel to the flow direction retarding to farther positions the upwash flow from the lower primary shear layer besides this horizontally directed flow inhibited the upwash flow coming from the lower primary shear layer relocating the a vortex to a lower y coordinate in comparison to that of the isolated cylinder although not shown here the latter could be observed by comparing the u y profiles obtained at the wake centerline for the mcc and ellipse cr versus the isolated circular cylinder by its shape the square cr shielded the upper primary shear layer and its wake was mainly defined by a large clockwise vortex b for the ellipse cr the upper primary shear layer is thinner and more aligned to the flow direction behind the ellipse cr two small secondary counter rotating vortices a and b were found at 2t 2 and the square cr the upper shear layer vortex b has evolved and increased in size canceling the a vortex detached from the lower primary shear layer in the lower rear part of the rod a counterclockwise rotating vortex a is born furthermore behind the mcc a new small a vortex appears and the b continues growing both rear vortices are importantly deflected to a lower negative y direction by the gap flow here a shifting of the frontal stagnation pressure to an upper angle is observed in the front of the main cylinder for the ellipse cr the rear a and b vortices are significantly larger than those induced by the square cr and the rear rod a vortex is smaller additionally the detached a vortex decreased in size and it was moved to a distant position at the subsequent instant 3t 4 and the square cr the b vortex is almost detached from the upper primary shear layer and the a a and b vortices continue to grow for the ellipse cr the detached primary a vortex from the lower shear layer has been vanished and it has been replaced with the distorted clockwise vortex b coming from the upper primary shear layer here the growth of the a vortex located behind the mcc created a thick alleyway flow follow the black arrow which in turn canceled out the rear b vortex and distorted the vortex b in the last 4t 4 instant a new vortex b is formed in the upper part of the square rod the a vortex is now almost detached from the gap positive shear layer displacing the b vortex to a farther downstream position and elongating the b vortex for the ellipse cr case the a vortex increased in size and the b vortex was distanced further from the mcc as the wake behind the rod alternated the a vortex has been disappeared and the b vortex was born for the msc the wake patterns induced by either the blunt or the streamlined cr were very different from those of the mcc in fig 19 b and t 4 it is observed how the upper primary shear layer is interrupted by the square rod presence as a consequence its formation length is shortened and the a vortex of the lower primary shear layer is relocated to an upper y position in comparison to the isolated square see fig 18 b such cr interruption separated the upper primary shear layer into two currents the highest one induced the creation of the vortex c detached from the upper part of the cr the lowest current triggers a gap flow formed by two opposite rotating shear layers by flow incidence the gap negative shear layer stretched the length of the b vortex in the cylinders gap throat the positive shear layer compresses the negative one as a consequence the thickness of the negative shear layer that envelopes the upper msc rear corner is reduced causing a decrease of the b vortex size no positive a vortex is visible at the lower face of the msc for the ellipse cr the main wake difference is that the c vortex is not developed as the shape is more streamlined at the second instant 2t 4 the vortex b has increased its size the a vortex has disappeared and the square rod wake has alternated to the c vortex for the ellipse cr the vortex b is bounded by the a vortex located in the lower side of the msc for the square rod and at 3t 4 the b vortex separates from the msc rear forming the vortex b and the direction of the alleyway flow is switched in the lower msc face the a vortex appears and the vortex a located in its corner is elongated excepting for the c vortex the same wake features were observed for the ellipse cr case at the instant 4t 4 the b vortex has been disappeared and the a vortex located near the lower primary shear layer has grown for both cr cases the lateral vortices a and b presented very similar shapes and the c and c wake vortices of the square rod were absent for the ellipse cr as shown in fig 20 for θ 157 5 the impinging flow packages are shielded by the crs and the gap flow has moved near the upper front face of the main cylinders for the mcc and both crs the positive shear layer formed in the cylinders gap compressed the negative one as a result the primary upper shear layer loses some strength and its thickness is decreased in comparison to that of the isolated cylinder this effect is also observed in the formation of smaller b vortices at the instants t 4 and 2t 4 also for both rod cases the detached b vortex visible at 3t 4 is smaller than the counterclockwise a at t 4 this latter indicates that the upwash flow of the lower primary shear layer is more energetic than the downwash motions produced by the primary upper one as a consequence positive lift forces appear between both rods the only difference was given by the barely visible c vortex located in the square cr wake which was not present for the ellipse one for the msc and the square rod at the instants t 4 and 2t 4 the gap flow induced the shrinking of the upper lateral b and the rear b vortices at 3t 4 and 4t 4 no important differences in wake patterns and vortices were found in comparison to those of the isolated square cylinder again the rear square rod c and c vortices were absent for the ellipse cr for this main cylinder geometry the overall wake patterns and vortices in all instants were almost identical to those of the isolated square cylinder the cylinders shear layer evolutions of fig 21 corresponding to θ 180 showed a recovery of flow symmetry and the formation of a cavity flow in the cylinders gap for both main cylinders the direction of the cavity flow switches its direction as the wake is evolving from the c l 0 instant to other state of either maximum or minimum c l where the detached vortices a or b have been vanished for the mcc the wake vortices were very similar to those of the isolated cylinder for the msc and at t 4 the flow packages of the cavity flow are directed to a negative direction weakening the b rear vortex and disappearing the lateral upper b one the same effect was observed in the corresponding lower a and a vortices at 3t 4 as shown in table 7 the vortices generated behind the crs induced the apparition of a secondary oscillating frequency sts in the wake of the main cylinders for the two main geometries this new oscillating frequency was about twice that of the main st for illustrative purposes fig 22 shows the frequency peaks obtained from the fft of the c l signal for the mcc at θ 67 5 3 8 phase diagrams of the main cylinders at different angular locations the mcc and msc phase plots at four distinctive angular locations are shown in fig 23 at θ 0 the mcc presents lower drag forces in comparison to the msc for all cases for the mcc the square cr induced the lowest c d and c l oscillations for the msc case the different crs induced similar lift attenuations and the drag reductions were low again the square cr presented the lowest values of drag coefficient at θ 67 5 the main cylinders are influenced by the apparition of negative repulsive forces and gap flows which depended highly on the geometry of the cr for the msc the magnitudes of c d and c l oscillations were increased drastically by the rods here the c l oscillated mostly between negative at higher levels of drag the highest oscillations were induced by the square cr for the mcc the lift oscillations were highly suppressed and the c d forces were not strongly amplified in fact for the case of the ellipse cr some drag reduction is visible at θ 157 5 and the mcc the crs induced some decrease in the maximum and minimum magnitudes of c l and showed a slight distortion of the coefficients toward negative values which is related to the loss of symmetry of the wake similar decreases in the magnitudes were present for the msc however the distortion effect was not observable for both main cylinders the square rod delivers the highest drag reductions at θ 180 the rods are located in a frontal position shielding the front face of the main cylinders here the rods induced drag decreases and some attenuation of the c l fluctuations the cr geometry was more influential for the msc than for the mcc and the square rod delivers the lowest values in both cases 3 9 the effect of the relative orientation of the control rod the effect of the rod angle β was tested by using the square rod and the main circular cylinder as a representative case the corresponding profiles of the drag and lift coefficients as well as the fluctuating lift and st are shown in fig 24 a d for comparison purposes the square cr at the original angular positions as well as the circular cr were included as shown in fig 24 a excepting for the rear position θ 0 the drag coefficient depended on the rod angle at the other positions here the drag reduction effect was enhanced up to 30 at β 30 and β 60 at the angular position of θ 180 it is noticeable that at θ 67 5 the increase in c d given by the square at the base angle was damped by rotating the rod between 0 and 30 excepting for β 0 at θ 67 5 the lift coefficient values resulted independent of the rod angle for the fluctuating lift coefficient no significant differences in terms of β were found contrastingly the st number was dependent on the rod angle mostly in the rear θ 0 and θ 67 5 locations thus given the dependence on β observed in the drag forces and vortex shedding frequencies this parameter should be further assessed in a future paper the effect β using the other non circular rods and other influential parameters as gap spacing and re will be presented 4 conclusions the influence of the rod geometry in the forces and wake formation of one circular cylinder and other with squared cross section was numerically investigated according to the results for both main cylinders the flow parameters c d c l c l and st were strongly influenced according to three angular intervals representing conditions of the rods immersed in the rear area of the main cylinder 0 θ 45 around its upper face 45 θ 135 and frontally 135 θ 180 in the rear part the c d reductions obtained by both main cylinders were moderate and quite independent on the control rod geometry for the main circular cylinder at θ 0 the c l decreased about 48 using the ellipse and the rectangular rods while for the circular square rods these values decreased up to 58 for the main square cylinder maximum decreases of 68 73 were produced by the circular and square control rods at θ 45 the st of the main circular cylinder was decreased by a maximum of 10 for the square control rod at θ 0 in contrast for the main square cylinder the st increased up to 18 depending on the rod shape in the angular interval of 45 θ 135 significant negative lift forces appear and the c d values increased in this range most of the flow parameters are highly dependent on the rod geometry for the main circular cylinder the maximum value was of c l 0 6 whereas for the main square cylinder the c l value was 1 1 both of them coincided at θ 67 5 in this angle c l value of the main circular cylinder was reduced up to 92 by the square and circular rods in the frontal interval of 135 θ 180 the drag reduction effect is again presented for the main circular cylinder the maximum drag reduction of 30 was produced by the square control rod at θ 157 5 for the main square cylinder the same rod induced a maximum of 24 of drag reduction at θ 180 in this position the c l values of the main circular cylinder were decreased by 21 for the square rod whereas the ellipse induced the lowest decrease of 11 at θ 180 while the st values given by the rods were almost equal to that of the base case those of the main square cylinder increased the different values obtained at the three previous angular intervals obey to different flow characteristics in the rear range given by 0 θ 45 the rods interfere with the natural shedding process of the upper and lower shear layers detached from both main cylinders the drag reduction effect is related to a decrease in the pressure deficit behind the main cylinder given by the rod presence the control rod geometry was moderately influential in most of the parameters and both main cylinders in addition the recirculation regions behind main cylinders were increased and some deficits in the mean streamwise velocity components were observed when the rods were located at the upper face 45 θ 135 the gap flows impinged upon the upper main cylinders faces for the main square cylinder the flow separation is unaltered however for the main circular cylinder the gap flows delayed importantly the upper separation point altering the upper shear layer wake formation and inducing high negative lift forces which depended strongly on the rod geometry the recirculation regions of the main circular cylinders were highly extended inducing hence high decreases in the c l and st coefficients other effects include strong deficits in the streamwise velocity component of the wake and the apparition of additional frequencies given by the new vortices detached from the rods for the main square cylinder the lift forces where higher than those of the main circular cylinder and the fluctuating lift forces were increased this last effect is contrary to that observed for the main circular cylinder finally when the rods were located at 135 θ 180 the drag reduction effect of the main circular cylinder is explained in terms of rod interference and pressure base recovery as some elongation of the mean recirculation region remained the st was also reduced additionally some deficit in the streamwise velocities along the wake line were found independently on the rod geometry for the main square cylinder the rear pressure deficit increased and because the mean recirculation regions were smaller than that of the base case the st increased for both main cylinders the c l values were similar to those of their corresponding base cases in a future work an extensive analysis of the influence of the local rod angle re and gap spacing will be performed credit authorship contribution statement alejandro alonzo garcia conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft visualization supervision

20634,the phenomenon of lateral buckling for subsea pipelines may result from the build up of axial force along the pipeline induced by high temperature difference the excessive lateral deflection resulting from lateral buckling may lead to fracture failure of welds or collapse of the pipeline in this study controlled lateral buckling triggered by imposed residual initial imperfections along the pipeline at designed locations is investigated mathematical models are proposed and analytical solutions are derived for subsea pipelines with the imposed residual initial imperfections which are validated by comparing with fea results the typical behaviour of lateral buckling triggered by unstressed or stressed initial imperfection is compared the effect of the amplitude and wavelength of the initial imperfection and the distance between adjacent initial imperfections on lateral buckling behaviour is discussed the results show that an appropriate wavelength of initial imperfection should be selected to mitigate the maximum stress in the post buckling state and to avoid snap through buckling phenomenon another efficient way to reduce the displacement amplitude and maximum stress is to reduce the distance between adjacent initial imperfections i e more buckles be triggered keywords subsea pipelines controlled lateral buckling imposed residual initial imperfection buckle initiation technique 1 introduction due to the high demand for oil and gas in recent years the exploration and production of offshore industry have moved to deep water in extreme high pressure and high temperature conditions subsea pipelines transporting oil and gas with high temperature and high pressure are the main component of subsea fields silva et al 2019 and will be subjected to axial compressive force due to thermal expansion and poisson s effect the pipeline laid on the seabed will buckle laterally to release the axial force when the critical compressive axial force reaches uncontrolled lateral buckling may lead to structural failure of the pipeline such as fracture fatigue or propagation buckling dnvgl rp f110 2018 in order to mitigate rogue buckles a number of lateral buckles will be initiated along the pipeline route at specific locations by means of buckle initiation techniques such as snake lay vertical upset local weight reduction and zero radius bends sinclair et al 2009 more recently another method creating intermittent residual curvature sections along the pipeline was first applied in statoil s skuld project to trigger buckles and to control the buckled deflection in an acceptable level endal et al 2014 when these residual curvature sections along the pipeline called initial imperfections are introduced the buckled configurations critical force and post buckling behaviour will all be affected the distance between adjacent initial imperfections determines the length between adjacent buckles called virtual anchor spacing which will eliminate the excessive thermal expansion into a single buckle along the pipeline route thus the influence of these introduced initial imperfections and the distance between them will be investigated analytically in this study many studies have been conducted for pipeline buckling throughout the past few years based on the proposed five classic types of lateral buckling modes analytical solutions for critical force wavelength and amplitude of the buckled deflection were derived by hobbs 1984 furthermore taking initial imperfections into account similar assumed buckling modes were employed to study the influence of initial imperfections on buckling behaviour by taylor and his colleagues taylor and gan 1986 taylor and tran 1993 then a simplified model was proposed by croll 1997 to study upheaval thermal buckling of imperfect subsea pipelines based on the response of upheaval buckling the difference between initially stressed and unstressed initial imperfections was compared by ju and kyriakides 1988 and karampour et al 2013 however the difference how the initially stressed and unstressed initial imperfections affect the lateral buckling response is still unclear shi et al 2013 investigated upheaval buckling by assuming the initial imperfection as an initially stressed state the total potential energy of the deformed state derived by hong et al 2015 and liu and wang 2018 was used to study lateral buckling of the subsea pipeline with a single arch symmetric initial imperfection by using the classic mode 3 proposed by hobbs 1984 the effect of the length between adjacent buckles on controlled lateral buckling was investigated by wang et al 2017b by assuming constant wavelength of the buckled section the effect of initial imperfection on critical force of lateral buckling with nonlinear soil resistance model was studied by karampour 2018 and zhang and guedes soares 2019 on the other hand the finite element method is widely used to study the buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines the critical force of upheaval buckling was studied by liu et al 2015 for buried pipelines by wang et al 2015a for pipe in pipe systems and by xu and lin 2017 for initially stressed submarine pipelines on the uneven seabed moreover simple formulas were proposed by zhang et al zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2018 to evaluate the critical force of lateral and upheaval buckling based on different profiles of initial imperfections an elastic plastic 3d explicit finite element model was proposed by li and liu 2019 to investigate the influences of the spacing relative direction and relative size of double imperfections on the global buckling characteristics the effect of the model length on the upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines with step imperfection was investigated by chen et al 2020 which was validated by the analytical models proposed by wang and van der heijden 2020 finite element models developed by abaqus were used to give a parametric solution for lateral buckling of subsea pipelines in terms of the various pipe material geometry parameters and the lateral and axial pipe soil interaction parameters guha et al 2020 as for the research about buckle initiation techniques lateral buckling triggered by buoyancy sections was investigated by peek and yun 2007 analytically by assuming the pipe section with buoyancy uplifted from the seabed lateral buckling triggered by a discrete single buoyancy was studied by shi and wang 2015 through assuming the contact regions between pipeline and seabed to be elastic soil resistance moreover the influence of the buoyancy sections on critical temperature difference and maximum stress was studied by wang and his colleagues wang et al 2017a 2018a symmetric and antisymmetric modes of lateral buckling triggered by sleeper were studied in wang and tang 2020 wang et al 2018a b the results showed that both symmetric and antisymmetric modes can be triggered depending on the sleeper friction and sleeper height the feature of lifting deformation for a pipeline laid on a sleeper was analysed by hong and liu 2020 through finite element analysis fea the method of introducing residual curvature along the pipeline prior to or during installation with prescribed radius and wavelength to control lateral buckling was studied by chee et al 2018 2019 through fea which could be a valuable modification of the practical design of offshore pipelines the objective of this paper is to propose a mathematical model that enables to predict lateral buckling response of subsea pipelines with imposed residual curvatures along the pipeline route the comparison between analytical solutions and fea results is carried out to verify the mathematical model typical buckling behaviour triggered by stressed and unstressed initial imperfections has been compared for single lateral buckle triggered by single initial imperfection snap through buckling phenomenon is discussed and the effect of the amplitude and wavelength of the initial imperfection on the buckled configuration and post buckling behaviour is studied then the response of multiple buckles triggered by multiple initial imperfections is analysed in the context of the distance between adjacent initial imperfections 2 mathematical formulation the buckle initiation technique creating local residual curvature along the pipeline at specified locations by adjustment of the reel ship s straightener system during installation endal et al 2014 was used to control thermal buckling during operation so that there is no need to employ other buckle initiation techniques such as sleeper distributed buoyancy section or snake lay this local residual curvature is initially unstressed imperfection which means that the curved pipeline is in a stress free state the other type of initial imperfection is the initially stressed imperfection which means that the straight pipeline is in a stress free state under external loading the initially stressed imperfection may be formed along the pipeline which can shrink back to the straight stress free state when the external loading disappears the local geometric initial imperfection see fig 3 is symmetric about x 0 defined by 1 w 0 x w m 0 2 1 cos λ e x 0 x l 0 0 x l 0 where λ e π l 0 w m 0 is the amplitude of initial imperfection and l 0 is the half wavelength of initial imperfection the axial compressive force p 0 induced by the operating temperature difference t 0 between the fluid flowing inside the pipe and the environment can be written as 2 p 0 e a α t 0 where e is the elastic modulus a is the cross sectional area of the pipeline and α is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion lateral buckling rather than upheaval buckling occurs for subsea pipeline laid on the seabed dnvgl rp f110 2018 the pipe section with initial imperfection is more likely to buckle due to the reduction of critical axial compressive force during the process of lateral buckling the pipe will deflect laterally which requires extra pipe to feed in to form the lateral deflection in view of this feed in the axial compressive force within the buckle drops the axial compressive force increases with increasing distance from the centre of the buckle which will increase to p 0 at x l s when the pipeline is long enough as shown in fig 1 a where l s is called the half length of feed in region in this study when multiple initial imperfections are created with a distance of 2 l a multiple buckles will be triggered along the pipeline with a distance of 2 l a the axial compressive force accumulates up to p a at x l a which is lower than p 0 as shown in fig 1 b the axial compressive force distribution p x shown in fig 1 is 3 p x p f a x 0 x l s l a where p

the pipeline with the introduced initial imperfections is shown in fig 2 where l 1 and l 2 are half length of the main lobe in the buckle and half length of the whole buckled section respectively and l 1 is always smaller than l 2 the relationships between l 0 and l 1 or l 2 should be determined since both l 1 and l 2 varies with the temperature difference on the basis of the relationship between l 0 and l 1 or l 2 there are three cases i e case a 0 l 0 l 1 case b l 1 l 0 l 2 case c l 0 l 2 based on the linear beam column theory the equilibrium equations that govern the buckled configuration

σ p σ m m where the stresses σ p and σ m m induced by axial force p and maximum bending moment m m respectively are 25 σ p p a σ m m m m d 2 i 3 results the effect of the introduced residual initial imperfection on the buckling behaviour is investigated based on the formulas derived in section 2 with the parameters listed in table 1 first the mathematical model is validated the comparison of the initially stressed and unstressed imperfection is presented subsequently the influence of the amplitude and wavelength of the initial imperfection on the buckled configuration typical buckling behaviour displacement amplitude and maximum stress is discussed finally controlled lateral buckling behaviour is studied under the circumstances of the effect of distance between adjacent initial imperfections 3 1 validation in order to validate the analytical solutions a nonlinear finite element model for lateral thermal buckling of subsea pipelines is proposed by abaqus harper 2009 the beam element pipe32h in abaqus is suitable for the simulation of pipeline wang et al 2015c the spring1 element is selected to simulate the axial and lateral soil resistances between pipeline and seabed spring1 is installed between pipeline and ground acting in a fixed direction which can be effectively used to simulate non linear pipe soil interaction wang et al 2015b both ends of the pipeline are pinned because each end of the pipeline represents the centre of two adjacent buckles where no axial displacement happens the length of the pipeline is 2000 m which simulates the situation l a 1000 m i e the distance between two buckles is 2000 m an initial imperfection expressed by eq 1 is introduced at the centre of the pipeline the half wavelength and the amplitude of initial imperfection are 25 m and 0 2 m respectively the implicit dynamic method is selected as the calculation method to simulate lateral buckling of subsea pipelines the parameters listed in table 1 are used in the finite element analyses the comparison between analytical solutions and fea results is showed in fig 4 from fig 4 it s clear to see that the displacement amplitude w m the maximum stress σ m and the axial force p of analytical solutions and fea results have good agreement even though some discrepancy exists the temperature difference corresponding to the peak value of axial force p is defined as the upper bound critical temperature difference denoted by t m u as shown in fig 4 c the upper bound critical temperature differences t m u of analytical solution and fea results are 20 258 c and 19 870 c respectively the difference between which is 1 915 from fig 4 a and b both the displacement amplitude w m and maximum stress σ m of analytical solutions are smaller than that of fea results when the temperature difference is smaller than t m u while they become larger than that of fea results when the temperature difference is larger than t m u taking t 0 40 c as an example the displacement amplitudes w m of analytical solutions and fea results are 3 770 m and 3 538 m respectively the difference between which is 6 154 the maximum stresses σ m of analytical solutions and fea results at t 0 40 c are 386 075 mpa and 365 776 mpa respectively the difference between which is 5 258 the axial forces p of analytical solutions and fea results at t 0 40 c are 0 212 mn and 0 205 mn respectively the difference between which is 3 415 these errors may come from the assumption of constant axial compressive force in the analytical formulations 3 2 comparison of initially stressed and unstressed imperfection the comparison of the initially stressed and unstressed imperfection illustrated in fig 5 will be discussed in this part for initially stressed imperfection the pipeline is stress free in the straight state and it s in the stressed state when the initial imperfection is introduced for initially stressed imperfection the governing equations of buckled configurations for the imperfect pipeline are the same as the ideal straight pipeline wang et al 2017b the introduction of the stressed initial imperfection only affects the requirement of the end shortening wang and van der heijden 2017 for initially unstressed imperfection the pipeline with initial curvature is stress free the introduced residual curvature belongs to the case of initially unstressed imperfection the governing equations of the pipeline with initially unstressed imperfection are different from that for the ideal straight pipeline from fig 5 the results for initially stressed imperfection are closer to the outcoming of ideal straight pipeline than that of initially unstressed imperfection because the governing equations of the buckled configurations for initially unstressed imperfect pipeline are affected due to the introduction of residual initial imperfection from fig 5 the displacement amplitude w m the maximum stress σ m and maximum bending stress σ m m are not zero and are equal to the stress of the introduced stressed initial imperfection both σ m and σ m m at t 0 0 for initially stressed imperfection are induced by the bending stress of initial imperfection for initially stressed imperfection w m at t 0 0 equals to the amplitude of the initial imperfection the straight path o m u in fig 5 is added by hand since the end shortening u 2 is smaller than u 20 which is invalid from fig 5 the influence of the initially unstressed imperfection on the buckling behaviour is larger than that of the initially stressed imperfection especially for σ m and σ m m in this study residual initial imperfections are introduced to trigger lateral buckles which belong to the case of initially unstressed imperfection thus in the following sections lateral buckling behaviour for pipeline with initially unstressed imperfection will be studied comprehensively 3 3 influence of w m 0 the influence of amplitude of initial imperfection w m 0 on the buckled configuration and typical buckling behaviour is analysed in this part 3 3 1 influence of w m 0 on buckled configuration the deformation and bending stress along the buckled pipeline with different w m 0 are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively in the circumstances of symmetry of the deformation only half solutions are illustrated here from the deformation shown in fig 6 a l 0 20 m is smaller than l 1 which belongs to case a the results shown in fig 6 b are case b since l 0 is larger than l 1 and smaller than l 2 from fig 6 the amplitude of the deflection in the centre i e x 0 is larger than the other one for each case so the displacement amplitude w m locates at x 0 from fig 6 a for l 0 20 m the deflection around the amplitude in the positive direction enlarges while the deflection in the negative direction shrinks when initial imperfection exists the amplitude of the deflection in the positive direction becomes larger when initial imperfection exists which increases further with increasing w m 0 however the amplitude of the deflection in the negative direction becomes smaller compared to the case of no imperfection which is smaller for larger w m 0 from fig 6 b for l 0 80 m the whole deflection in the positive direction enlarges when initial imperfection exists which becomes larger for larger w m 0 in fig 7 three amplitudes of bending stress exist along the buckled pipeline the amplitude of bending stress absolute value at x 0 is larger than others which is the maximum bending stress σ m m from fig 7 a for l 0 20 m σ m m becomes larger when initial imperfection exists which increases with increasing w m 0 however from fig 7 b for l 0 80 m σ m m becomes smaller when initial imperfection exists which decreases with increasing w m 0 3 3 2 influence of w m 0 on buckling behaviour the influences of w m 0 on typical buckling behaviour are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 for l 0 20 m and l 0 80 m respectively these two similar cases are presented because of the different effect on typical buckling behaviour the snap through phenomenon is also illustrated in fig 8 from fig 8 for the cases with the smaller value of w m 0 i e w m 0 0 1 m the response rises to a limit temperature difference t m u first during the process of decreasing temperature difference another limit temperature difference t m l is defined as the lower bound critical temperature difference the process that the axial force p increases with the uplifting temperature difference from t 0 0 to t 0 t m u is defined as the pre buckling state the branches m u m l and m l b are defined as post buckling branches which are unstable and stable respectively since the displacement amplitude w m diminishes and increases with increasing temperature difference along branches m u m l and m l b respectively in the pre buckling state both the axial force p and the stress induced by p increase with increasing temperature difference along paths p 0 e a α t 0 and σ 0 e α t 0 respectively as shown in fig 8 c and e the reason is that small reduction of axial force takes place since the lateral deflection is very small during this process see fig 8 a due to the small deflection both l s and σ m m are also small and close to zero in the pre buckling state the maximum stress σ m increases along the path σ 0 e α t 0 and is slightly larger than σ 0 since σ m is composed of σ p and σ m m when the temperature difference increases to t m u the pipeline will jump from pre buckling state to stable post buckling state i e from state m u to b during this process w m l s σ m m and σ m have a sudden increase while p and σ p have a sudden decrease during the process of decreasing temperature difference the pipeline will jump from post buckling state to pre buckling state at t m l i e from state m l to c during this process w m l s σ m m and σ m have a sudden decrease while p and σ p have a sudden increase from fig 8 for the cases with the larger value of w m 0 i e w m 0 0 2 m or 0 4 m the jumps between pre buckling state and post buckling state disappear from fig 8 c the upper bound critical temperature difference t m u still exists since a peak p always exists for each case while the lower bound critical temperature difference t m l disappears the process that the axial force p increases with increasing temperature difference is also defined as the pre buckling state while the process that the axial force p decreases with increasing temperature difference is also defined as the stable post buckling state the unstable post buckling state disappears from fig 8 in the stable post buckling state under the same temperature difference w m σ m l s and σ m m all become larger when initial imperfection exists which become further larger for larger w m 0 however p and σ p become smaller when initial imperfection exists which become further smaller for larger w m 0 the influence of w m 0 on σ m m and σ m is larger than other parameters the cases shown in fig 9 have the same ratios l 0 w m 0 with the cases shown in fig 8 the results shown in fig 9 are used to illustrate that different buckling behaviour appears even though they have the same ratios l 0 w m 0 the ratios l 0 w m 0 for the cases shown in figs 8 and 9 are 200 100 and 50 the black dots shown in fig 9 are the locations where the maximum axial forces locate for the cases with l 0 80 m shown in fig 9 the displacement amplitude w m is very small in the pre buckling state requiring small length of feed in region see fig 9 d so the maximum bending stress in the pre buckling state is also very small see fig 9 f the path that the axial force p increases with increasing temperature difference in the pre buckling state is almost the same with the path p 0 e a α t 0 σ m increases with temperature difference in the pre buckling state along the path σ 0 e α t 0 see fig 9 b which is controlled by σ p see fig 9 e in the post buckling state the most significant differences between the cases of l 0 20 m and l 0 80 m are maximum stress σ m and stress induced by maximum bending moment σ m m for l 0 80 m under the same temperature difference in the stable post buckling state both σ m and σ m m become smaller when the initial imperfection exists which are further smaller for larger w m 0 this is contrary to the conclusions for l 0 20 m 3 3 3 parametric analysis for w m 0 the influence of w m 0 on w m and σ m under a specific temperature difference t 0 40 c is illustrated in fig 10 the normalised w m and σ m shown in fig 10 a and b are normalised against the corresponding values of the cases without initial imperfection the values of w m and σ m for the cases without initial imperfection are 4 376 m and 403 694 mpa the ratios l 0 l 1 and l 0 l 2 are also shown in fig 10 to check which case they belong to in fig 10 the case of w m 0 0 m represents the case that no initial imperfection exists so that the normalised w m and σ m are 1 at w m 0 0 m from fig 10 c and d the case of l 0 20 m is case a since l 0 l 1 and the cases of l 0 40 m 60 m and 80 m are case b since l 1 l 0 l 2 and the case of l 0 100 m is case c since l 0 l 2 from fig 10 a the normalised w m increases with increasing w m 0 for each l 0 the conclusion can be drawn that the displacement amplitude will rise when initial imperfection exists which will increase further with expanding w m 0 from fig 10 b the normalised σ m increases with increasing w m 0 for l 0 20 m and 40 m however it decreases with rising w m 0 for l 0 60 m 80 m and 100 m the influence of w m 0 depends on the value of l 0 so in the following section the influence of l 0 will be analysed in detail 3 4 influence of l 0 the influence of half wavelength of initial imperfection l 0 on the buckled configuration and typical buckling behaviour is analysed 3 4 1 influence of l 0 on buckled configuration the deformation and bending stress along the buckled pipeline with different l 0 are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively two groups i e a group of relative small l 0 and a group of relative large l 0 are illustrated from fig 11 the case of l 0 20 m is case a and the cases of l 0 40 m 60 m and 80 m are case b and the cases of l 0 100 m and 120 m are case c from fig 11 the amplitude of the deflection at the centre becomes larger when initial imperfection exists which is barely affected by l 0 from fig 12 a compared to the case of no initial imperfection the maximum bending stress at the centre absolute value becomes larger for l 0 20 m and 40 m which becomes smaller for 60 m the maximum bending stresses at the centre absolute value for the cases shown in fig 12 b are all smaller when initial imperfection exists which are larger for larger l 0 3 4 2 influence of l 0 on buckling behaviour the influence of l 0 on typical buckling behaviour is presented in fig 13 in the pre buckling state the displacement amplitude w m becomes smaller for larger l 0 as shown in fig 13 a so the requirement of the feed in region l s is smaller for larger l 0 see fig 13 d the axial force approaches to the path p 0 e a α t 0 with increasing l 0 in the pre buckling state see fig 13 c the maximum stress σ m is adjacent to the path σ 0 e α t 0 for larger l 0 in the pre buckling state see fig 13 b since σ p is closer to the path σ 0 e α t 0 see fig 13 e and σ m m is closer to 0 see fig 13 f for larger l 0 the maximum value of p and the upper bound critical temperature difference t m u become larger with increasing l 0 the snap through phenomenon disappears gradually with decreasing l 0 in the post buckling state the effect of l 0 on w m l s p and σ p reduces with increasing temperature difference in the post buckling state compared to the case without initial imperfection σ m m and σ m are larger for l 0 20 m and 40 m however they become smaller for l 0 80 m 3 4 3 parametric analysis for l 0 the influence of l 0 on normalised w m and σ m under a specific temperature difference t 0 40 c is shown in fig 14 the normalised w m and σ m shown in fig 14 a and b are normalised against the corresponding values of the cases without initial imperfection the values of w m and σ m for the cases without initial imperfection are 4 376 m and 403 694 mpa the ratios l 0 l 1 and l 0 l 2 are also shown in fig 14 to check which case they belong to from the ratios l 0 l 1 and l 0 l 2 shown in fig 14 c and d all the regions shown in fig 14 a and b are divided into three parts in fig 14 the case of l 0 0 m represents the case that no initial imperfection exists so that the normalised w m and σ m are 1 at l 0 0 m from fig 14 a the normalised w m increases first and then decreases with increasing l 0 for each w m 0 the increasing or decreasing rates of w m become larger for larger w m 0 in fig 14 b the normalised σ m for small l 0 is much larger than that without initial imperfection because the initial imperfection is sharper for smaller l 0 the normalised σ m decreases first and then increases with increasing l 0 which approaches to 1 when l 0 is large enough the increasing or decreasing rates of σ m become larger for larger w m 0 when l 0 increases to l 0 e the normalised σ m reduces to 1 which means that the maximum stress for l 0 l 0 e equals to that without initial imperfection for different values of w m 0 l 0 e almost keeps the same which is also close to the length between the amplitudes of deflection in the positive and negative directions for 0 l 0 l 0 e the normalised σ m for the case with initial imperfection is larger than that without initial imperfection for l 0 l 0 e the normalised σ m for the case with initial imperfection is smaller than that without initial imperfection thus an appropriate l 0 should be introduced in order to mitigate the maximum stress 3 5 influence of l a the influence of the distance between adjacent initial imperfections on the typical buckling behaviour is analysed 3 5 1 influence of l a on buckling behaviour the influence of distance between adjacent initial imperfections on typical buckling behaviour is shown in fig 15 the case of l a represents that only one initial imperfection is introduced along the pipeline which means that only one lateral buckle at the location of initial imperfection is triggered for this case the requirement of the length of feed in region can always be satisfied p a for l a shown in fig 15 d increases with t 0 along the path p 0 e a α t 0 i e p a p 0 which represents the situation that no interaction between adjacent buckles takes place when multiple initial imperfections with a specific distance are introduced along the pipeline multiple buckles along the pipeline at the locations of initial imperfections can be triggered three cases for l a 500 m 1000 m and 1500 m are illustrated in fig 15 the case of l a 1000 m i e path b 1 b 2 will be used to analyse the influence of l a in the pre buckling state and unstable buckling state half length of feed in region l s is smaller than l a see fig 15 f and p a increases with increasing t 0 along the path p 0 e a α t 0 so that there is no interaction between adjacent buckles in the stable post buckling state l s increases to l a 1000 m see fig 15 f when t 0 increases up to t 0 b 1 the label b 1 in fig 15 corresponds to the situation that l s l a the results shown in fig 15 for l a and l a 1000 m are the same when l s l a since adjacent buckles develop separately and no interaction takes place between adjacent buckles the requirement of half length of feed in region will be larger than l a when t 0 is larger than t 0 b 1 however the maximum half length of feed in region is l a 1000 m from fig 15 f for the case l a 1000 m half length of feed in region l s equals to 1000 m when t 0 t 0 b 1 so that axial thermal expansion will be restricted compared to the case of l a see fig 15 e thus axial interaction between adjacent buckles occurs since p a reduces compared to the case of l a see fig 15 d therefore both w m and σ m will reduce due to less release in axial thermal expansion the axial force p becomes larger compared to the case of l a see fig 15 c the increasing rates of both w m and σ m with t 0 become smaller for smaller l a since the axial thermal expansion becomes smaller for smaller l a 3 5 2 parametric analysis for l a the influence of l a on different parameters under a specific temperature difference t 0 40 c is shown in fig 16 the normalised parameters shown in fig 16 are normalised against the corresponding values of the case l a for the case l a and t 0 40 c w m 4 412 m σ m 420 354 mpa u 1 0 351 m and l s 1937 943 m the label n illustrated in fig 16 corresponds to the situation that half length of feed in region l s equals to l a for l a l a n the normalised l s equals to 1 which means that half length of feed in region l s equals to the case of l a the distance between adjacent initial imperfections is large enough so that no interaction occurs between adjacent buckles thus all the other results shown in fig 16 are not affected when l a l a n for l a l a n l s equals to l a and the normalised l s is smaller than 1 which means that interaction between adjacent buckles takes place both the normalised w m and σ m decrease with decreasing l a since the normalised u 1 decreases with decreasing l a for l a 500 m the normalised w m and σ m have a reduction of 38 95 and 18 71 respectively compared to the case of l a 4 conclusions in this study the residual initial imperfections are introduced along the pipeline to trigger buckles at designed locations in a controlled manner mathematical models are proposed for subsea pipelines with the introduced residual initial imperfections and the corresponding analytical solutions are derived the analytical solutions are validated by comparing with finite element analysis results which show good agreement typical buckling behaviours for initially stressed and unstressed imperfection are compared the influence of the amplitude and wavelength of the initial imperfection and the distance between adjacent initial imperfections on the buckled configurations typical buckling behaviour displacement amplitude and maximum stress are discussed based on these parametric analysis the following conclusions can be drawn i from the comparison of the initially stressed and unstressed imperfection the influence of the initially unstressed imperfection on buckling behaviour is larger than that for initially stressed imperfection the reason is that for initially stressed imperfection the buckling behaviour is only affected by the initial end shortening introduced by initially stressed imperfection while for initially unstressed imperfection the governing equations of the buckled configuration change due to the introduction of residual initial curvature ii snap through buckling may occur when initial imperfection exists which disappears gradually with increasing amplitude of initial imperfection or with decreasing wavelength of initial imperfection the critical axial force and the corresponding critical temperature difference decrease with the elevating amplitude of initial imperfection or with the abating wavelength of initial imperfection iii the displacement amplitude becomes larger compared to the case of ideal straight pipeline when the initial imperfection is introduced it increases further with increasing amplitude of initial imperfection it first increases and then decreases with the increasing wavelength of initial imperfection iv when the half wavelength of initial imperfection is smaller than the distance between the amplitudes of the deflection in the positive and negative direction the maximum stress of imperfect pipeline is larger than that for ideal straight pipeline which increases further with increasing amplitude of initial imperfection when the half wavelength of initial imperfection is larger than the distance between the amplitudes of the deflection in the positive and negative direction the maximum stress for imperfect pipeline is smaller than that for ideal straight pipeline which decreases further with increasing amplitude of initial imperfection thus the selection of the wavelength of initial imperfection is very important v the interaction between adjacent buckles triggered by multiple introduced initial imperfections appears when the requirement of the length of feed in region is larger than the distance between adjacent initial imperfections the displacement amplitude and maximum stress will be restrained due to the limitation of length of feed in region after the appearance of interaction between adjacent buckles which also decrease with decreasing distance between adjacent initial

20634,the phenomenon of lateral buckling for subsea pipelines may result from the build up of axial force along the pipeline induced by high temperature difference the excessive lateral deflection resulting from lateral buckling may lead to fracture failure of welds or collapse of the pipeline in this study controlled lateral buckling triggered by imposed residual initial imperfections along the pipeline at designed locations is investigated mathematical models are proposed and analytical solutions are derived for subsea pipelines with the imposed residual initial imperfections which are validated by comparing with fea results the typical behaviour of lateral buckling triggered by unstressed or stressed initial imperfection is compared the effect of the amplitude and wavelength of the initial imperfection and the distance between adjacent initial imperfections on lateral buckling behaviour is discussed the results show that an appropriate wavelength of initial imperfection should be selected to mitigate the maximum stress in the post buckling state and to avoid snap through buckling phenomenon another efficient way to reduce the displacement amplitude and maximum stress is to reduce the distance between adjacent initial imperfections i e more buckles be triggered keywords subsea pipelines controlled lateral buckling imposed residual initial imperfection buckle initiation technique 1 introduction due to the high demand for oil and gas in recent years the exploration and production of offshore industry have moved to deep water in extreme high pressure and high temperature conditions subsea pipelines transporting oil and gas with high temperature and high pressure are the main component of subsea fields silva et al 2019 and will be subjected to axial compressive force due to thermal expansion and poisson s effect the pipeline laid on the seabed will buckle laterally to release the axial force when the critical compressive axial force reaches uncontrolled lateral buckling may lead to structural failure of the pipeline such as fracture fatigue or propagation buckling dnvgl rp f110 2018 in order to mitigate rogue buckles a number of lateral buckles will be initiated along the pipeline route at specific locations by means of buckle initiation techniques such as snake lay vertical upset local weight reduction and zero radius bends sinclair et al 2009 more recently another method creating intermittent residual curvature sections along the pipeline was first applied in statoil s skuld project to trigger buckles and to control the buckled deflection in an acceptable level endal et al 2014 when these residual curvature sections along the pipeline called initial imperfections are introduced the buckled configurations critical force and post buckling behaviour will all be affected the distance between adjacent initial imperfections determines the length between adjacent buckles called virtual anchor spacing which will eliminate the excessive thermal expansion into a single buckle along the pipeline route thus the influence of these introduced initial imperfections and the distance between them will be investigated analytically in this study many studies have been conducted for pipeline buckling throughout the past few years based on the proposed five classic types of lateral buckling modes analytical solutions for critical force wavelength and amplitude of the buckled deflection were derived by hobbs 1984 furthermore taking initial imperfections into account similar assumed buckling modes were employed to study the influence of initial imperfections on buckling behaviour by taylor and his colleagues taylor and gan 1986 taylor and tran 1993 then a simplified model was proposed by croll 1997 to study upheaval thermal buckling of imperfect subsea pipelines based on the response of upheaval buckling the difference between initially stressed and unstressed initial imperfections was compared by ju and kyriakides 1988 and karampour et al 2013 however the difference how the initially stressed and unstressed initial imperfections affect the lateral buckling response is still unclear shi et al 2013 investigated upheaval buckling by assuming the initial imperfection as an initially stressed state the total potential energy of the deformed state derived by hong et al 2015 and liu and wang 2018 was used to study lateral buckling of the subsea pipeline with a single arch symmetric initial imperfection by using the classic mode 3 proposed by hobbs 1984 the effect of the length between adjacent buckles on controlled lateral buckling was investigated by wang et al 2017b by assuming constant wavelength of the buckled section the effect of initial imperfection on critical force of lateral buckling with nonlinear soil resistance model was studied by karampour 2018 and zhang and guedes soares 2019 on the other hand the finite element method is widely used to study the buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines the critical force of upheaval buckling was studied by liu et al 2015 for buried pipelines by wang et al 2015a for pipe in pipe systems and by xu and lin 2017 for initially stressed submarine pipelines on the uneven seabed moreover simple formulas were proposed by zhang et al zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2018 to evaluate the critical force of lateral and upheaval buckling based on different profiles of initial imperfections an elastic plastic 3d explicit finite element model was proposed by li and liu 2019 to investigate the influences of the spacing relative direction and relative size of double imperfections on the global buckling characteristics the effect of the model length on the upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines with step imperfection was investigated by chen et al 2020 which was validated by the analytical models proposed by wang and van der heijden 2020 finite element models developed by abaqus were used to give a parametric solution for lateral buckling of subsea pipelines in terms of the various pipe material geometry parameters and the lateral and axial pipe soil interaction parameters guha et al 2020 as for the research about buckle initiation techniques lateral buckling triggered by buoyancy sections was investigated by peek and yun 2007 analytically by assuming the pipe section with buoyancy uplifted from the seabed lateral buckling triggered by a discrete single buoyancy was studied by shi and wang 2015 through assuming the contact regions between pipeline and seabed to be elastic soil resistance moreover the influence of the buoyancy sections on critical temperature difference and maximum stress was studied by wang and his colleagues wang et al 2017a 2018a symmetric and antisymmetric modes of lateral buckling triggered by sleeper were studied in wang and tang 2020 wang et al 2018a b the results showed that both symmetric and antisymmetric modes can be triggered depending on the sleeper friction and sleeper height the feature of lifting deformation for a pipeline laid on a sleeper was analysed by hong and liu 2020 through finite element analysis fea the method of introducing residual curvature along the pipeline prior to or during installation with prescribed radius and wavelength to control lateral buckling was studied by chee et al 2018 2019 through fea which could be a valuable modification of the practical design of offshore pipelines the objective of this paper is to propose a mathematical model that enables to predict lateral buckling response of subsea pipelines with imposed residual curvatures along the pipeline route the comparison between analytical solutions and fea results is carried out to verify the mathematical model typical buckling behaviour triggered by stressed and unstressed initial imperfections has been compared for single lateral buckle triggered by single initial imperfection snap through buckling phenomenon is discussed and the effect of the amplitude and wavelength of the initial imperfection on the buckled configuration and post buckling behaviour is studied then the response of multiple buckles triggered by multiple initial imperfections is analysed in the context of the distance between adjacent initial imperfections 2 mathematical formulation the buckle initiation technique creating local residual curvature along the pipeline at specified locations by adjustment of the reel ship s straightener system during installation endal et al 2014 was used to control thermal buckling during operation so that there is no need to employ other buckle initiation techniques such as sleeper distributed buoyancy section or snake lay this local residual curvature is initially unstressed imperfection which means that the curved pipeline is in a stress free state the other type of initial imperfection is the initially stressed imperfection which means that the straight pipeline is in a stress free state under external loading the initially stressed imperfection may be formed along the pipeline which can shrink back to the straight stress free state when the external loading disappears the local geometric initial imperfection see fig 3 is symmetric about x 0 defined by 1 w 0 x w m 0 2 1 cos λ e x 0 x l 0 0 x l 0 where λ e π l 0 w m 0 is the amplitude of initial imperfection and l 0 is the half wavelength of initial imperfection the axial compressive force p 0 induced by the operating temperature difference t 0 between the fluid flowing inside the pipe and the environment can be written as 2 p 0 e a α t 0 where e is the elastic modulus a is the cross sectional area of the pipeline and α is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion lateral buckling rather than upheaval buckling occurs for subsea pipeline laid on the seabed dnvgl rp f110 2018 the pipe section with initial imperfection is more likely to buckle due to the reduction of critical axial compressive force during the process of lateral buckling the pipe will deflect laterally which requires extra pipe to feed in to form the lateral deflection in view of this feed in the axial compressive force within the buckle drops the axial compressive force increases with increasing distance from the centre of the buckle which will increase to p 0 at x l s when the pipeline is long enough as shown in fig 1 a where l s is called the half length of feed in region in this study when multiple initial imperfections are created with a distance of 2 l a multiple buckles will be triggered along the pipeline with a distance of 2 l a the axial compressive force accumulates up to p a at x l a which is lower than p 0 as shown in fig 1 b the axial compressive force distribution p x shown in fig 1 is 3 p x p f a x 0 x l s l a where p is the axial compressive force at the centre of the buckle f a μ a w p i p e is the axial soil resistance μ a is the axial friction coefficient between pipe and seabed w p i p e is the submerged weight per unit length of the pipeline based on the axial force balance the following formulas are satisfied 4 p 0 p f a l s l s l a p a p f a l a l s l a the configuration and load distribution of the pipeline with the introduced initial imperfections is shown in fig 2 where l 1 and l 2 are half length of the main lobe in the buckle and half length of the whole buckled section respectively and l 1 is always smaller than l 2 the relationships between l 0 and l 1 or l 2 should be determined since both l 1 and l 2 varies with the temperature difference on the basis of the relationship between l 0 and l 1 or l 2 there are three cases i e case a 0 l 0 l 1 case b l 1 l 0 l 2 case c l 0 l 2 based on the linear beam column theory the equilibrium equations that govern the buckled configuration

imperfections 3 1 validation in order to validate the analytical solutions a nonlinear finite element model for lateral thermal buckling of subsea pipelines is proposed by abaqus harper 2009 the beam element pipe32h in abaqus is suitable for the simulation of pipeline wang et al 2015c the spring1 element is selected to simulate the axial and lateral soil resistances between pipeline and seabed spring1 is installed between pipeline and ground acting in a fixed direction which can be effectively used to simulate non linear pipe soil interaction wang et al 2015b both ends of the pipeline are pinned because each end of the pipeline represents the centre of two adjacent buckles where no axial displacement happens the length of the pipeline is 2000 m which simulates the situation l a 1000 m i e the distance between two buckles is 2000 m an initial imperfection expressed by eq 1 is introduced at the centre of the pipeline the half wavelength and the amplitude of initial imperfection are 25 m and 0 2 m respectively the implicit dynamic method is selected as the calculation method to simulate lateral buckling of subsea pipelines the parameters listed in table 1 are used in the finite element analyses the comparison between analytical solutions and fea results is showed in fig 4 from fig 4 it s clear to see that the displacement amplitude w m the maximum stress σ m and the axial force p of analytical solutions and fea results have good agreement even though some discrepancy exists the temperature difference corresponding to the peak value of axial force p is defined as the upper bound critical temperature difference denoted by t m u as shown in fig 4 c the upper bound critical temperature differences t m u of analytical solution and fea results are 20 258 c and 19 870 c respectively the difference between which is 1 915 from fig 4 a and b both the displacement amplitude w m and maximum stress σ m of analytical solutions are smaller than that of fea results when the temperature difference is smaller than t m u while they become larger than that of fea results when the temperature difference is larger than t m u taking t 0 40 c as an example the displacement amplitudes w m of analytical solutions and fea results are 3 770 m and 3 538 m respectively the difference between which is 6 154 the maximum stresses σ m of analytical solutions and fea results at t 0 40 c are 386 075 mpa and 365 776 mpa respectively the difference between which is 5 258 the axial forces p of analytical solutions and fea results at t 0 40 c are 0 212 mn and 0 205 mn respectively the difference between which is 3 415 these errors may come from the assumption of constant axial compressive force in the analytical formulations 3 2 comparison of initially stressed and unstressed imperfection the comparison of the initially stressed and unstressed imperfection illustrated in fig 5 will be discussed in this part for initially stressed imperfection the pipeline is stress free in the straight state and it s in the stressed state when the initial imperfection is introduced for initially stressed imperfection the governing equations of buckled configurations for the imperfect pipeline are the same as the ideal straight pipeline wang et al 2017b the introduction of the stressed initial imperfection only affects the requirement of the end shortening wang and van der heijden 2017 for initially unstressed imperfection the pipeline with initial curvature is stress free the introduced residual curvature belongs to the case of initially unstressed imperfection the governing equations of the pipeline with initially unstressed imperfection are different from that for the ideal straight pipeline from fig 5 the results for initially stressed imperfection are closer to the outcoming of ideal straight pipeline than that of initially unstressed imperfection because the governing equations of the buckled configurations for initially unstressed imperfect pipeline are affected due to the introduction of residual initial imperfection from fig 5 the displacement amplitude w m the maximum stress σ m and maximum bending stress σ m m are not zero and are equal to the stress of the introduced stressed initial imperfection both σ m and σ m m at t 0 0 for initially stressed imperfection are induced by the bending stress of initial imperfection for initially stressed imperfection w m at t 0 0 equals to the amplitude of the initial imperfection the straight path o m u in fig 5 is added by hand since the end shortening u 2 is smaller than u 20 which is invalid from fig 5 the influence of the initially unstressed imperfection on the buckling behaviour is larger than that of the initially stressed imperfection especially for σ m and σ m m in this study residual initial imperfections are introduced to trigger lateral buckles which belong to the case of initially unstressed imperfection thus in the following sections lateral buckling behaviour for pipeline with initially unstressed imperfection will be studied comprehensively 3 3 influence of w m 0 the influence of amplitude of initial imperfection w m 0 on the buckled configuration and typical buckling behaviour is analysed in this part 3 3 1 influence of w m 0 on buckled configuration the deformation and bending stress along the buckled pipeline with different w m 0 are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively in the circumstances of symmetry of the deformation only half solutions are illustrated here from the deformation shown in fig 6 a l 0 20 m is smaller than l 1 which belongs to case a the results shown in fig 6 b are case b since l 0 is larger than l 1 and smaller than l 2 from fig 6 the amplitude of the deflection in the centre i e x 0 is larger than the other one for each case so the displacement amplitude w m locates at x 0 from fig 6 a for l 0 20 m the deflection around the amplitude in the positive direction enlarges while the deflection in the negative direction shrinks when initial imperfection exists the amplitude of the deflection in the positive direction becomes larger when initial imperfection exists which increases further with increasing w m 0 however the amplitude of the deflection in the negative direction becomes smaller compared to the case of no imperfection which is smaller for larger w m 0 from fig 6 b for l 0 80 m the whole deflection in the positive direction enlarges when initial imperfection exists which becomes larger for larger w m 0 in fig 7 three amplitudes of bending stress exist along the buckled pipeline the amplitude of bending stress absolute value at x 0 is larger than others which is the maximum bending stress σ m m from fig 7 a for l 0 20 m σ m m becomes larger when initial imperfection exists which increases with increasing w m 0 however from fig 7 b for l 0 80 m σ m m becomes smaller when initial imperfection exists which decreases with increasing w m 0 3 3 2 influence of w m 0 on buckling behaviour the influences of w m 0 on typical buckling behaviour are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 for l 0 20 m and l 0 80 m respectively these two similar cases are presented because of the different effect on typical buckling behaviour the snap through phenomenon is also illustrated in fig 8 from fig 8 for the cases with the smaller value of w m 0 i e w m 0 0 1 m the response rises to a limit temperature difference t m u first during the process of decreasing temperature difference another limit temperature difference t m l is defined as the lower bound critical temperature difference the process that the axial force p increases with the uplifting temperature difference from t 0 0 to t 0 t m u is defined as the pre buckling state the branches m u m l and m l b are defined as post buckling branches which are unstable and stable respectively since the displacement amplitude w m diminishes and increases with increasing temperature difference along branches m u m l and m l b respectively in the pre buckling state both the axial force p and the stress induced by p increase with increasing temperature difference along paths p 0 e a α t 0 and σ 0 e α t 0 respectively as shown in fig 8 c and e the reason is that small reduction of axial force takes place since the lateral deflection is very small during this process see fig 8 a due to the small deflection both l s and σ m m are also small and close to zero in the pre buckling state the maximum stress σ m increases along the path σ 0 e α t 0 and is slightly larger than σ 0 since σ m is composed of σ p and σ m m when the temperature difference increases to t m u the pipeline will jump from pre buckling state to stable post buckling state i e from state m u to b during this process w m l s σ m m and σ m have a sudden increase while p and σ p have a sudden decrease during the process of decreasing temperature difference the pipeline will jump from post buckling state to pre buckling state at t m l i e from state m l to c during this process w m l s σ m m and σ m have a sudden decrease while p and σ p have a sudden increase from fig 8 for the cases with the larger value of w m 0 i e w m 0 0 2 m or 0 4 m the jumps between pre buckling state and post buckling state disappear from fig 8 c the upper bound critical temperature difference t m u still exists since a peak p always exists for each case while the lower bound critical temperature difference t m l disappears the process that the axial force p increases with increasing temperature difference is also defined as the pre buckling state while the process that the axial force p decreases with increasing temperature difference is also defined as the stable post buckling state the unstable post buckling state disappears from fig 8 in the stable post buckling state under the same temperature difference w m σ m l s and σ m m all become larger when initial imperfection exists which become further larger for larger w m 0 however p and σ p become smaller when initial imperfection exists which become further smaller for larger w m 0 the influence of w m 0 on σ m m and σ m is larger than other parameters the cases shown in fig 9 have the same ratios l 0 w m 0 with the cases shown in fig 8 the results shown in fig 9 are used to illustrate that different buckling behaviour appears even though they have the same ratios l 0 w m 0 the ratios l 0 w m 0 for the cases shown in figs 8 and 9 are 200 100 and 50 the black dots shown in fig 9 are the locations where the maximum axial forces locate for the cases with l 0 80 m shown in fig 9 the displacement amplitude w m is very small in the pre buckling state requiring small length of feed in region see fig 9 d so the maximum bending stress in the pre buckling state is also very small see fig 9 f the path that the axial force p increases with increasing temperature difference in the pre buckling state is almost the same with the path p 0 e a α t 0 σ m increases with temperature difference in the pre buckling state along the path σ 0 e α t 0 see fig 9 b which is controlled by σ p see fig 9 e in the post buckling state the most significant differences between the cases of l 0 20 m and l 0 80 m are maximum stress σ m and stress induced by maximum bending moment σ m m for l 0 80 m under the same temperature difference in the stable post buckling state both σ m and σ m m become smaller when the initial imperfection exists which are further smaller for larger w m 0 this is contrary to the conclusions for l 0 20 m 3 3 3 parametric analysis for w m 0 the influence of w m 0 on w m and σ m under a specific temperature difference t 0 40 c is illustrated in fig 10 the normalised w m and σ m shown in fig 10 a and b are normalised against the corresponding values of the cases without initial imperfection the values of w m and σ m for the cases without initial imperfection are 4 376 m and 403 694 mpa the ratios l 0 l 1 and l 0 l 2 are also shown in fig 10 to check which case they belong to in fig 10 the case of w m 0 0 m represents the case that no initial imperfection exists so that the normalised w m and σ m are 1 at w m 0 0 m from fig 10 c and d the case of l 0 20 m is case a since l 0 l 1 and the cases of l 0 40 m 60 m and 80 m are case b since l 1 l 0 l 2 and the case of l 0 100 m is case c since l 0 l 2 from fig 10 a the normalised w m increases with increasing w m 0 for each l 0 the conclusion can be drawn that the displacement amplitude will rise when initial imperfection exists which will increase further with expanding w m 0 from fig 10 b the normalised σ m increases with increasing w m 0 for l 0 20 m and 40 m however it decreases with rising w m 0 for l 0 60 m 80 m and 100 m the influence of w m 0 depends on the value of l 0 so in the following section the influence of l 0 will be analysed in detail 3 4 influence of l 0 the influence of half wavelength of initial imperfection l 0 on the buckled configuration and typical buckling behaviour is analysed 3 4 1 influence of l 0 on buckled configuration the deformation and bending stress along the buckled pipeline with different l 0 are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 respectively two groups i e a group of relative small l 0 and a group of relative large l 0 are illustrated from fig 11 the case of l 0 20 m is case a and the cases of l 0 40 m 60 m and 80 m are case b and the cases of l 0 100 m and 120 m are case c from fig 11 the amplitude of the deflection at the centre becomes larger when initial imperfection exists which is barely affected by l 0 from fig 12 a compared to the case of no initial imperfection the maximum bending stress at the centre absolute value becomes larger for l 0 20 m and 40 m which becomes smaller for 60 m the maximum bending stresses at the centre absolute value for the cases shown in fig 12 b are all smaller when initial imperfection exists which are larger for larger l 0 3 4 2 influence of l 0 on buckling behaviour the influence of l 0 on typical buckling behaviour is presented in fig 13 in the pre buckling state the displacement amplitude w m becomes smaller for larger l 0 as shown in fig 13 a so the requirement of the feed in region l s is smaller for larger l 0 see fig 13 d the axial force approaches to the path p 0 e a α t 0 with increasing l 0 in the pre buckling state see fig 13 c the maximum stress σ m is adjacent to the path σ 0 e α t 0 for larger l 0 in the pre buckling state see fig 13 b since σ p is closer to the path σ 0 e α t 0 see fig 13 e and σ m m is closer to 0 see fig 13 f for larger l 0 the maximum value of p and the upper bound critical temperature difference t m u become larger with increasing l 0 the snap through phenomenon disappears gradually with decreasing l 0 in the post buckling state the effect of l 0 on w m l s p and σ p reduces with increasing temperature difference in the post buckling state compared to the case without initial imperfection σ m m and σ m are larger for l 0 20 m and 40 m however they become smaller for l 0 80 m 3 4 3 parametric analysis for l 0 the influence of l 0 on normalised w m and σ m under a specific temperature difference t 0 40 c is shown in fig 14 the normalised w m and σ m shown in fig 14 a and b are normalised against the corresponding values of the cases without initial imperfection the values of w m and σ m for the cases without initial imperfection are 4 376 m and 403 694 mpa the ratios l 0 l 1 and l 0 l 2 are also shown in fig 14 to check which case they belong to from the ratios l 0 l 1 and l 0 l 2 shown in fig 14 c and d all the regions shown in fig 14 a and b are divided into three parts in fig 14 the case of l 0 0 m represents the case that no initial imperfection exists so that the normalised w m and σ m are 1 at l 0 0 m from fig 14 a the normalised w m increases first and then decreases with increasing l 0 for each w m 0 the increasing or decreasing rates of w m become larger for larger w m 0 in fig 14 b the normalised σ m for small l 0 is much larger than that without initial imperfection because the initial imperfection is sharper for smaller l 0 the normalised σ m decreases first and then increases with increasing l 0 which approaches to 1 when l 0 is large enough the increasing or decreasing rates of σ m become larger for larger w m 0 when l 0 increases to l 0 e the normalised σ m reduces to 1 which means that the maximum stress for l 0 l 0 e equals to that without initial imperfection for different values of w m 0 l 0 e almost keeps the same which is also close to the length between the amplitudes of deflection in the positive and negative directions for 0 l 0 l 0 e the normalised σ m for the case with initial imperfection is larger than that without initial imperfection for l 0 l 0 e the normalised σ m for the case with initial imperfection is smaller than that without initial imperfection thus an appropriate l 0 should be introduced in order to mitigate the maximum stress 3 5 influence of l a the influence of the distance between adjacent initial imperfections on the typical buckling behaviour is analysed 3 5 1 influence of l a on buckling behaviour the influence of distance between adjacent initial imperfections on typical buckling behaviour is shown in fig 15 the case of l a represents that only one initial imperfection is introduced along the pipeline which means that only one lateral buckle at the location of initial imperfection is triggered for this case the requirement of the length of feed in region can always be satisfied p a for l a shown in fig 15 d increases with t 0 along the path p 0 e a α t 0 i e p a p 0 which represents the situation that no interaction between adjacent buckles takes place when multiple initial imperfections with a specific distance are introduced along the pipeline multiple buckles along the pipeline at the locations of initial imperfections can be triggered three cases for l a 500 m 1000 m and 1500 m are illustrated in fig 15 the case of l a 1000 m i e path b 1 b 2 will be used to analyse the influence of l a in the pre buckling state and unstable buckling state half length of feed in region l s is smaller than l a see fig 15 f and p a increases with increasing t 0 along the path p 0 e a α t 0 so that there is no interaction between adjacent buckles in the stable post buckling state l s increases to l a 1000 m see fig 15 f when t 0 increases up to t 0 b 1 the label b 1 in fig 15 corresponds to the situation that l s l a the results shown in fig 15 for l a and l a 1000 m are the same when l s l a since adjacent buckles develop separately and no interaction takes place between adjacent buckles the requirement of half length of feed in region will be larger than l a when t 0 is larger than t 0 b 1 however the maximum half length of feed in region is l a 1000 m from fig 15 f for the case l a 1000 m half length of feed in region l s equals to 1000 m when t 0 t 0 b 1 so that axial thermal expansion will be restricted compared to the case of l a see fig 15 e thus axial interaction between adjacent buckles occurs since p a reduces compared to the case of l a see fig 15 d therefore both w m and σ m will reduce due to less release in axial thermal expansion the axial force p becomes larger compared to the case of l a see fig 15 c the increasing rates of both w m and σ m with t 0 become smaller for smaller l a since the axial thermal expansion becomes smaller for smaller l a 3 5 2 parametric analysis for l a the influence of l a on different parameters under a specific temperature difference t 0 40 c is shown in fig 16 the normalised parameters shown in fig 16 are normalised against the corresponding values of the case l a for the case l a and t 0 40 c w m 4 412 m σ m 420 354 mpa u 1 0 351 m and l s 1937 943 m the label n illustrated in fig 16 corresponds to the situation that half length of feed in region l s equals to l a for l a l a n the normalised l s equals to 1 which means that half length of feed in region l s equals to the case of l a the distance between adjacent initial imperfections is large enough so that no interaction occurs between adjacent buckles thus all the other results shown in fig 16 are not affected when l a l a n for l a l a n l s equals to l a and the normalised l s is smaller than 1 which means that interaction between adjacent buckles takes place both the normalised w m and σ m decrease with decreasing l a since the normalised u 1 decreases with decreasing l a for l a 500 m the normalised w m and σ m have a reduction of 38 95 and 18 71 respectively compared to the case of l a 4 conclusions in this study the residual initial imperfections are introduced along the pipeline to trigger buckles at designed locations in a controlled manner mathematical models are proposed for subsea pipelines with the introduced residual initial imperfections and the corresponding analytical solutions are derived the analytical solutions are validated by comparing with finite element analysis results which show good agreement typical buckling behaviours for initially stressed and unstressed imperfection are compared the influence of the amplitude and wavelength of the initial imperfection and the distance between adjacent initial imperfections on the buckled configurations typical buckling behaviour displacement amplitude and maximum stress are discussed based on these parametric analysis the following conclusions can be drawn i from the comparison of the initially stressed and unstressed imperfection the influence of the initially unstressed imperfection on buckling behaviour is larger than that for initially stressed imperfection the reason is that for initially stressed imperfection the buckling behaviour is only affected by the initial end shortening introduced by initially stressed imperfection while for initially unstressed imperfection the governing equations of the buckled configuration change due to the introduction of residual initial curvature ii snap through buckling may occur when initial imperfection exists which disappears gradually with increasing amplitude of initial imperfection or with decreasing wavelength of initial imperfection the critical axial force and the corresponding critical temperature difference decrease with the elevating amplitude of initial imperfection or with the abating wavelength of initial imperfection iii the displacement amplitude becomes larger compared to the case of ideal straight pipeline when the initial imperfection is introduced it increases further with increasing amplitude of initial imperfection it first increases and then decreases with the increasing wavelength of initial imperfection iv when the half wavelength of initial imperfection is smaller than the distance between the amplitudes of the deflection in the positive and negative direction the maximum stress of imperfect pipeline is larger than that for ideal straight pipeline which increases further with increasing amplitude of initial imperfection when the half wavelength of initial imperfection is larger than the distance between the amplitudes of the deflection in the positive and negative direction the maximum stress for imperfect pipeline is smaller than that for ideal straight pipeline which decreases further with increasing amplitude of initial imperfection thus the selection of the wavelength of initial imperfection is very important v the interaction between adjacent buckles triggered by multiple introduced initial imperfections appears when the requirement of the length of feed in region is larger than the distance between adjacent initial imperfections the displacement amplitude and maximum stress will be restrained due to the limitation of length of feed in region after the appearance of interaction between adjacent buckles which also decrease with decreasing distance between adjacent initial
