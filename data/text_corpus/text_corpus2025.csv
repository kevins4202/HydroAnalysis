10125,kernel weight kw is the key to ensuring seed vigor in hybrid maize zea mays l production and irrigation is important for ensuring kw in arid regions irrigation experiments were conducted in an arid region of northwest china to investigate the effects of water deficit on kw plant growth rate per kernel after silking pgrkas lag phase duration lpd kernel growth rate during effective grain filling kgregf and effective grain filling duration egfd which included a 50 water deficit at the vegetative stage and a 50 and 100 water deficit at the flowering and grain filling stages in 2018 and 2019 a restricted pollination treatment and two defoliation treatments three and six leaves were removed from the top 14 days after silking were conducted under each irrigation treatment in 2019 to obtain a wide range of data on grain filling characteristics and aboveground biomass the results showed that a 50 water deficit at the vegetative stage shortened egfd and lpd in both years the 50 and 100 water deficit at the grain filling stage decreased kw pgrkas egfd and kgregf in 2019 but had no significant differences in each indices in 2018 due to heavy rainfall we found a bilinear plateau relationship between relative kgregf rkgregf and relative pgrkas rpgrkas as well as a logistic relationship between relative egfd and rpgrkas rkgregf combined with the jensen model to simulate biomass characteristic parameters the maximum aboveground biomass the day of year of the maximum absolute growth rate and the initial growth rate the kw water model performed well in predicting the kw of hybrid maize seed production under different irrigation treatments this research provides a quantitative method for modeling the kw of hybrid maize seed production which considers the source sink relationship under different water regimes in arid areas keywords grain filling characteristic water deficit plant growth rate kernel weight model source sink relationship 1 introduction seed vigor is an important index of seed quality and determines the potential for rapid and uniform emergence of plants wen et al 2018 kernel weight kw is one of the components of seed quality that affects crop performance high seed quality can increase yield by 15 20 ambika et al 2014 studies have shown that kw is positively correlated with seed vigor roy et al 1996 gholami et al 2009 ghazi and al karaki 2010 in addition the difference in yield can be observed for similar kernel number per unit land indicating that the difference in kw can significantly affect yield determination the irrigation schedule is key to increasing kw while deficit irrigation is an important strategy to improve water use efficiency in arid regions therefore modeling the kw under a water deficit is useful for ensuring yield and seed vigor however few studies have been conducted on modeling kw under different water regimes maize is the third most widely grown cereal after rice and wheat in the world eskandari et al 2018 hybrid maize lines shows numerous agronomic benefits including higher yield and disease resistance compared with conventional maize the production of hybrid maize seeds is the key to ensuring the wide planting of maize unlike conventional maize hybrid maize seed production is divided into male and female inbreds in order to prevent self pollination female inbreds are detached from the top the grain filling process of maize is often divided into three phases the lag phase effective grain filling phase and physiological maturity phase bewley and black 1985 the lag phase begins after ovary fertilization and is characterized by a rapid increase in kernel water content and relatively little dry matter accumulation prado et al 2013 the effective grain filling phase is the key period of kernel formation and is characterized by a rapid nearly linear increase in dry matter accumulation in the third phase the kernel growth rate decreases and the kernels reach the final kw melchiori and caviglia 2008 a bilinear plateau model of kw is often used to describe this process which includes a linear growth period before reaching the final weight but neglects kw gained during the lag phase borrás et al 2003 gambín et al 2007 severini et al 2011 edreira et al 2014 a water deficit at different growth stages affects kw by changing the source sink ratio after flowering borrás and westgate 2006 wang et al 2019 ouattar et al 1987 found that no irrigation from the lag phase to maturity reduced kw by 50 but no irrigation from linear filling to maturity did not significantly change kw however nesmith and ritchie 1992a found that a water deficit duration for 12 days at the flowering stage produced larger kernels however a water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages significantly decreased kernel numbers wang et al 2017 in addition assimilation supply may be insufficient because of a water deficit at different growth stages therefore an efficient irrigation schedule is of great significance for realizing high yield and quality of hybrid maize seeds the effective grain filling duration and kernel growth rate are two important grain filling characteristics and primary kw drivers borrás and gambín 2010 wei et al 2019 the lag phase is critical for establishing the potential kw and kernel growth rate gambín et al 2008 the grain filling characteristics are affected by water deficits during the grain filling stage studies have shown that no irrigation at the grain filling stage significantly shortened the effective grain filling duration but did not significantly reduce the kernel growth rate ouattar et al 1987 nesmith and ritchie 1992b westgate 1994 however the grain filling characteristics of maize under a water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages have not been studied kw is usually simulated by kernel growth rate and grain filling duration and many researchers have related the two grain filling characteristics to other factors at the kernel level the kernel growth rate is positively correlated with kernel maximum water content and the potential kernel growth rate can be estimated from kernel water content at the end of the lag phase borrás et al 2003 borrás and gambín 2010 the grain filling duration is correlated to the kernel desiccation rate and it can be studied as a linear function of thermal time from maximum water content to physiological maturity gambín et al 2007 at the single plant level plant growth rate per kernel is often used to estimate the kernel growth rate borrás and westgate 2006 echarte et al 2006 gambín et al 2006 2008 borrás and gambín 2010 in the ceres maize model kernel growth rate is calculated from the potential kernel growth rate environmental factors and assimilate availability jones et al 2003 ma et al 2018 in this study we quantified the relationships between grain filling characteristics kernel growth rate during effective grain filling and effective grain filling duration and plant growth rate to simulate the kw of hybrid maize seed production under different water deficits at different growth stages water shortages are a major factor restricting the development of the seed industry in arid regions and it is important to ensure the seed vigor of hybrid maize under a water deficit to realize sustainable development therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the response of grain filling characteristics of hybrid maize seed production to a water deficit at different growth stages 2 establish the relationships between grain filling characteristics and plant growth rate and 3 predict the kw under different water regimes in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment field experiments were conducted in 2018 and 2019 at shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province 37 52n 102 50e altitude 1581 m the experimental site has a typical continental temperate climate with an annual average temperature of 8 8 c mean sunshine duration of 3000 h and a frost free period of 150 d the annual mean precipitation is 164 4 mm and the annual mean evaporation is 2000 mm the groundwater table is below 25 m the soil in the experimental station is classified as sandy loam with a mean dry bulk density of 1 38 g cm 3 wilting point water content of 0 12 cm3 cm 3 and field water capacity water content of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 in the 0 1 m soil layer before sowing all plots were fertilized with 100 kg n ha 1 225 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 60 kg k2o ha 1 as basal fertilizers after fertilization the soil surface in each plot was partially covered with transparent plastic film polyethylene blown film 0 015 mm thick and 1 2 m wide shandong jining zhongqu double star plastic products factory jining china the width of the bare soil between the two strips of plastic film mulch was 0 4 m the drip irrigated plots with four rows of hybrid maize were top dressed with 100 kg n ha 1 during the vegetative and flowering stages the spacing of drip irrigation belts was 0 8 m the distance between emitters was 0 3 m and the flow rate was 2 5 l h 1 the total planting density of male and female inbreds was 9 75 plants m 2 the row spacing was 40 cm and the planting spacing was 25 cm for male and female inbreds to ensure the emergence of seedlings the female parents were irrigated with 30 mm immediately after sowing for all treatments during both years the cultivars planting dates of female parents first and second batch of male parents and planting proportions are given in table 1 maize was sown in one row of male parents with six rows of female parents in 2018 and one row of male parents with five rows of female parents in 2019 the two batches of male inbreds were planted in the same rows with six plants each from the first and second batches placed in an alternating pattern the female inbreds were detasseled on 3 july 2018 and 15 july 2019 and the harvesting dates were 17 sept in each year weeding and pest control measures followed local practices the study consisted of two experiments of which exp i was an irrigation experiment and exp ii added defoliation and restricted pollination treatments based on exp i in exp i 16 irrigation treatments during vegetative v flowering f and grain filling g stages were carried out each year the sufficient irrigation depth per event i was the difference between evapotranspiration and effective precipitation 5 mm wang et al 2021 the evapotranspiration was the product of the crop coefficient k c and reference crop evapotranspiration et0 where k c values were 0 33 0 90 1 10 1 02 and 0 80 at the seedling vegetative flowering grain filling and maturity stages respectively jiang 2016 and et0 was calculated by the meteorological data during the last irrigation period allen et al 1998 there were no irrigation treatments at the seedling and maturity stages the two irrigation levels applied at the vegetative stage were 100 i and 50 i and the three irrigation levels applied at the flowering and grain filling stages were 100 i 50 i and 0 i the irrigation depth and times during each growth stage in 2018 and 2019 are presented in table 2 under the control treatment v2f2g2 the maize inbred lines were irrigated every 10 days starting from june 5 2018 and june 4 2019 and all the irrigation events in the different treatments were made in the same day a randomized block design with three replicates per irrigation treatment was used the experimental plot size was 4 8 m wide and 46 m long and a buffer area 6 m wide and 46 m long separated the different treatments female inbreds were planted in the buffer zones in order to obtain the grain filling characteristics and aboveground plant biomass with different source sink relationships another experiment was added in 2019 in exp ii a split plot design was used to decrease the kernel number and assimilation during the effective grain filling phase the 16 irrigation treatments for exp i in 2019 were the main effects and a restricted pollination treatment and two defoliation treatments were secondary effects pollination was prevented in approximately 50 apical ears with paper bags two days after silking as a restricted pollination treatment about 10 leaves remained after detasseling of female inbreds and three and six leaves were removed from the top as the 30 and 60 defoliation treatments respectively under each treatment 50 female inbreds plants were defoliated 14 days after silking the exp ii was only used to establish the relationships between grain filling characteristics and plant growth rate under different irrigation treatments 30 female inbreds plants were tagged to record the dates of silking at least one silk exposed 1 cm from the husk silking date was the day when 50 of female inbreds reached silking every 4 7 days in each year four plants and 1500 kernels 300 kernels 5 replicates per treatment were dried in an oven at 85 c to a constant weight to obtain aboveground biomass and kw respectively the growth of kw was obtained using a bilinear plateau model 1 kw a b tt as tt as c a b c

growth rate during effective grain filling kgregf mg c 1 d 1 c is the total grain filling duration c d a b is the lag phase duration lpd c d and the effective grain filling duration egfd c d was calculated by the difference between c and lpd the soil water content was measured every 3 5 days using a diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd adelaide australia at a depth of 1 m in each plot two pvc tubes were installed below the bare soil and mulch and the measurements were calibrated by the gravimetric method fig 1 shows the trends of mean soil volumetric water content in the 0 1 m soil layer under different irrigation treatments in 2018 and 2019 the crop evapotranspiration was calculated as 2 et p e i w r d w where et is evapotranspiration mm p e is the effective precipitation mm i is the irrigation depth mm w is the supplement from groundwater mm r is the surface runoff mm d is the deep drainage mm and δw is the variation in soil water storage mm w is negligible because the groundwater table is below 25 m r is zero because the experimental site is flat d was ignored because the soil water content at the 0 9 1 0 m layer did not change before and after irrigation meteorological data were logged by an automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp bourne ma usa the meteorological data for both growth stages are shown in fig 2 2 2 kw water model the kw was estimated using the following equation echarte et al 2006 3 kw kgr egf egfd because the cultivars were different during the two years the values of kgregf egfd and plant growth rate per kernel after silking pgrkas mg c 1 d 1 were expressed relative to the control treatment v2f2g2 each year studies have shown that there is a linear relationship between kernel growth rate and plant growth rate gambín et al 2006 2008 borrás and gambín 2010 however when the assimilate availability approaches saturation the kernel growth rate reaches its maximum borrás et al 2004 therefore we developed a bilinear plateau model to establish the relationship between relative kgregf rkgregf and relative pgrkas rpgrkas 4 rkgr egf d e rpgrk as rpgrk as f d e f rpgrk as f 5 pgrk as δ b as tt as kn 10 3 in

fitting parameters a water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages delayed silking therefore we used a logistic curve to fit biomass dynamics and calculate aboveground biomass gain after

rate per kernel after silking and grain filling characteristics the et kw lpd kgregf pgrkas and egfd are shown in table 3 because of the high rainfall during the grain filling stage in 2018 fig 1 there were no significant differences in et kw pgrkas kgregf and egfd under irrigation treatments at this stage the whole stage et ranged from 257 6 to 436 5 mm in 2018 and from 300 5 to 530 9 mm in 2019 and the kw ranged from 308 5 to 341 0 mg in 2018 and from 171 7 to 312 3 mg in 2019 a water deficit at vegetative and grain filling stages significantly reduced kw the treatment of v2f0g2 had the highest kw and increased by 1 7 in 2018 and 3 8 in 2019 compared to the control treatment v2f2g2 this result was similar to that of nesmith and ritchie 1992a borrás et al 2004 suggested that increasing the assimilate availability per kernel post flowering could only increase the kw marginally however when maize crops were exposed to the source strength reduction kw showed a large decrease compared to v2f2g2 et decreased by 16 6 and 19 3 in v2f0g2 treatment but pgrkas increased by 6 0 and 6 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the increasing assimilate availability per kernel after silking may be the reason for the increased kw under a water deficit at the flowering stage the plant growth rate per kernel is usually reduced with stress gambín et al 2008 severini et al 2011 pgrkas ranged from 0 463 to 0 569 mg c 1 d 1 in 2018 and 0 212 0 693 mg c 1 d 1 in 2019 a 50 water deficit at the vegetative stage shortened lpd significantly in both years but a 50 and 100 water deficit at flowering and grain filling stages had no effects on lpd except for v1f0g2 and v1f0g1 in 2018 a water deficit of 50 at the vegetative stage shortened egfd significantly in both years but decreased kgregf only in 2019 the kernel water content at the end of the lag phase is often used to estimate the kernel sink capacity borrás and gambín 2010 therefore the shorter lpd under a water deficit at the vegetative stage is one reason for the reduction of kw kgregf and egfd maddonni et al 1998 a water deficit of 50 and 100 at the grain filling stage decreased pgrkas kgregf and egfd in 2019 some studies showed that a water deficit at the grain filling stage significantly shortened the egpd by accelerating kernel desiccation but did not reduce kernel growth rate significantly ouattar et al 1987 nesmith and ritchie 1992b westgate 1994 sala et al 2007 in this study the shortage of assimilates caused by a water deficit at the grain filling stage may be the reason for the reduction in kgregf a water deficit at the flowering stage increased kgregf significantly but had no significant effects on egfd the increase in kw caused by a water deficit at the flowering stage was due to the increase in kgregf rather than increasing egfd gambín et al 2007 also suggested that increasing the assimilate availability per kernel did not increase egfd in maize 3 2 the relationships between grain filling characteristics and plant growth rate the bilinear plateau relationship between rkgregf and rpgrkas for exps i and ii is shown in fig 4a rkgregf increased with increasing rpgrkas when rpgrkas 1 06 rkgregf 1 03 which is the potential rkgregf when rpgrkas 0 rkgregf 0 67 which is rkgregf of δb as 0 the logistic relationship between regfd and rpgrkas rkgregf fitted by the data of exps i and ii is shown in fig 4b the regfd increased as rpgrkas rkgregf increased when rpgrkas rkgregf approached infinity regfd 1 03 which was a potential regfd when rpgrkas rkgregf 0 regfd 0 73 which is the regfd of δb as 0 the amount of assimilates available per kernel during lag phase determines the endosperm cell number and potential kw jones et al 1996 borrás and westgate 2006 borrás and gambín 2010 studies have shown that the plant growth rate around flowering is positively correlated with kernel growth rate but plant growth rate during the effective grain filling stage had little effect on kernel growth rate andrade and ferreiro 1996 echarte et al 2006 gambín et al 2006 2008 borrás and gambín 2010 although the potential kernel size has been established at the end of the lag phase reducing the amount of assimilates during the effective filling phase such as defoliation and shading will disrupt the source sink balance borrás and gambín 2010 in this study the plant growth rate after silking was used to establish a relationship with kgregf fig 4a which considered the source sink changes throughout the total grain filling phase the egfd is affected by the source sink ratio during the grain filling period cirilo and andrade 1996 borrás and otegui 2001 echarte et al 2006 gambín et al 2006 suggested that egfd tended to be longer for genotypes with higher ratios between plant growth rate per kernel and kernel growth rate during the effective grain filling period which is consistent with our results when δb as 0 the kernel growth is mainly restricted by the source and the assimilates stored in vegetative organs of the plant are transferred to kernels uhart and andrade 1995 wang et al 2019 suggested that the upper limit of kw was 178 4 mg and the lower limit of kw was 155 6 mg when the post flowering biomass gain of hybrid maize seed production was zero in this study when δb as 0 kw 164 0 and 147 2 mg in 2018 and 2019 respectively borrás et al 2004 showed that the kw increased by 16 at the assimilate availability per kernel saturation during the grain filling stage we found that the potential kernel weights were 355 6 and 319 3 mg in each year and increased by 6 1 compared with the control treatment 3 3 modeling biomass characteristic parameters and kernel weight under different irrigation treatments the models of rao jensen and minhas were used to simulate the biomass characteristic parameters b m k and t the water sensitivity indices of biomass characteristic parameters at vegetative flowering and grain filling stages calibrated for 12 irrigation treatments during both years are shown in table 4 for b m the highest r 2 of 0 93 and the lowest rrmse of 0 042 were obtained for the jensen model the b m was found to be more sensitive to a water deficit at the grain filling stage than the vegetative and flowering stages for k the jensen model produced the highest r 2 of 0 97 and the lowest rrmse of 0 035 the negative values of water sensitivity indices indicated that a water deficit at each growth stage increased k for t the minhas model gave the highest r 2 of 0 92 and the lowest rrmse of 0 008 the lower values of water sensitivity indices at each growth stage indicated that a water deficit had little effect on t the measured biomass characteristic parameters and the predicted values by different models validated by 20 irrigation treatments during both years are shown in fig 5 although the rao model had the best validation results for b m the jensen model had the highest r 2 ef and d ia and the lowest are for k and t among the three models therefore the jensen model was the most suitable for simulating aboveground biomass gain after silking water production functions are often used to describe the relationship between crop yield and evapotranspiration at different growth stages chen et al 2014 developed water production functions to predict the fruit quality of tomatoes under a water deficit at different growth stages wang et al 2018 used water production functions to estimate the flowering characteristics of hybrid maize seed production under a water deficit at different growth stages in this study the forms of water production functions were used to quantify the relationships between biomass characteristic parameters b m k and t and crop evapotranspiration at the vegetative flowering and grain filling stages using the jensen model to simulate aboveground biomass gain after silking the fitted results of the kw water model are shown in fig 6 kw was underestimated by 1 under different irrigation treatments the kw water model performed well in predicting the kw of hybrid maize seed production over a wide range 171 7 340 2 mg and it can be used to simulate kw under different water regimes in arid regions our previous results indicated that a water deficit at the flowering stage improved seed vigor by increasing kw and water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages reduced seed vigor by decreasing kw shi et al 2020 therefore combined with the water flowering model wang et al 2018 to predict kernel number the optimal irrigation depth at the different growth stages to ensure yield and seed vigor of hybrid maize under a water deficit must be investigated in next research plan 4 conclusions this study was conducted to investigate the effects of water deficit at different growth stages on grain filling characteristics of hybrid maize seed production and to simulate kernel weight kw under a water deficit by kernel growth rate during effective grain filling kgregf and effective grain filling duration egfd research has shown that a 50 water deficit at the vegetative stage shortened egfd and the lag phase duration while a 100 water deficit at the flowering stage increased kw because of the increase in plant growth rate per kernel after silking pgrkas we established a bilinear plateau relationship between relative kgregf rkgregf and relative pgrkas rpgrkas and a logistic relationship between relative egfd and rpgrkas rkgregf the jensen model was the best for predicting biomass characteristic parameters to obtain aboveground biomass gains after silking the kw water model performed well in predicting the kw of hybrid maize seed production and underestimated by 1 under different water regimes our research is useful for ensuring seed vigor of hybrid maize production under limited water availability in arid areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

obtain a wide range of data on grain filling characteristics and aboveground biomass the results showed that a 50 water deficit at the vegetative stage shortened egfd and lpd in both years the 50 and 100 water deficit at the grain filling stage decreased kw pgrkas egfd and kgregf in 2019 but had no significant differences in each indices in 2018 due to heavy rainfall we found a bilinear plateau

characteristic parameters the maximum aboveground biomass the day of year of the maximum absolute growth rate and the initial growth rate the kw water model performed well in predicting the kw of hybrid maize seed production under different irrigation treatments this research provides a quantitative method for modeling the kw of hybrid maize seed production which considers the source sink relationship under different water regimes in arid areas keywords grain filling characteristic water deficit plant growth rate kernel weight model source sink relationship 1 introduction seed vigor is an important index of seed quality and determines the potential for rapid and uniform emergence of plants wen et al 2018 kernel weight kw is one of the components of seed quality that affects crop performance high seed quality can increase yield by 15 20 ambika et al 2014 studies have shown that kw is positively correlated with seed vigor roy et al 1996 gholami et al 2009 ghazi and al karaki 2010 in addition the difference in yield can be observed for similar kernel number per unit land indicating that the difference in kw can significantly affect yield determination the irrigation schedule is key to increasing kw while deficit irrigation is an important strategy to improve water use efficiency in arid regions therefore modeling the kw under a water deficit is useful for ensuring yield and seed vigor however few studies have been conducted on modeling kw under different water regimes maize is the third most widely grown cereal after rice and wheat in the world eskandari et al 2018 hybrid maize lines shows numerous agronomic benefits including higher yield and disease resistance compared with conventional maize the production of hybrid maize seeds is the key to ensuring the wide planting of maize unlike conventional maize hybrid maize seed production is divided into male and female inbreds in order to prevent self pollination female inbreds are detached from the top the grain filling process of maize is often divided into three phases the lag phase effective grain filling phase and physiological maturity phase bewley and black 1985 the lag phase begins after ovary fertilization and is characterized by a rapid increase in kernel water content and relatively little dry matter accumulation prado et al 2013 the effective grain filling phase is the key period of kernel formation and is characterized by a rapid nearly linear increase in dry matter accumulation in the third phase the kernel growth rate decreases and the kernels reach the final kw melchiori and caviglia 2008 a bilinear plateau model of kw is often used to describe this process which includes a linear growth period before reaching the final weight but neglects kw gained during the lag phase borrás et al 2003 gambín et al 2007 severini et al 2011 edreira et al 2014 a water deficit at different growth stages affects kw by changing the source sink ratio after flowering borrás and westgate 2006 wang et al 2019 ouattar et al 1987 found that no irrigation from the lag phase to maturity reduced kw by 50 but no irrigation from linear filling to maturity did not significantly change kw however nesmith and ritchie 1992a found that a water deficit duration for 12 days at the flowering stage produced larger kernels however a water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages significantly decreased kernel numbers wang et al 2017 in addition assimilation supply may be insufficient because of a water deficit at different growth stages therefore an efficient irrigation schedule is of great significance for realizing high yield and quality of hybrid maize seeds the effective grain filling duration and kernel growth rate are two important grain filling characteristics and primary kw drivers borrás and gambín 2010 wei et al 2019 the lag phase is critical for establishing the potential kw and kernel growth rate gambín et al 2008 the grain filling characteristics are affected by water deficits during the grain filling stage studies have shown that no irrigation at the grain filling stage significantly shortened the effective grain filling duration but did not significantly reduce the kernel growth rate ouattar et al 1987 nesmith and ritchie 1992b westgate 1994 however the grain filling characteristics of maize under a water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages have not been studied kw is usually simulated by kernel growth rate and grain filling duration and many researchers have related the two grain filling characteristics to other factors at the kernel level the kernel growth rate is positively correlated with kernel maximum water content and the potential kernel growth rate can be estimated from kernel water content at the end of the lag phase borrás et al 2003 borrás and gambín 2010 the grain filling duration is correlated to the kernel desiccation rate and it can be studied as a linear function of thermal time from maximum water content to physiological maturity gambín et al 2007 at the single plant level plant growth rate per kernel is often used to estimate the kernel growth rate borrás and westgate 2006 echarte et al 2006 gambín et al 2006 2008 borrás and gambín 2010 in the ceres maize model kernel growth rate is calculated from the potential kernel growth rate environmental factors and assimilate availability jones et al 2003 ma et al 2018 in this study we quantified the relationships between grain filling characteristics kernel growth rate during effective grain filling and effective grain filling duration and plant growth rate to simulate the kw of hybrid maize seed production under different water deficits at different growth stages water shortages are a major factor restricting the development of the seed industry in arid regions and it is important to ensure the seed vigor of hybrid maize under a water deficit to realize sustainable development therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the response of grain filling characteristics of hybrid maize seed production to a water deficit at different growth stages 2 establish the relationships between grain filling characteristics and plant growth rate and 3 predict the kw under different water regimes in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment field experiments were conducted in 2018 and 2019 at shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province 37 52n 102 50e altitude 1581 m the experimental site has a typical continental temperate climate with an annual average temperature of 8 8 c mean sunshine duration of 3000 h and a frost free period of 150 d the annual mean precipitation is 164 4 mm and the annual mean evaporation is 2000 mm the groundwater table is below 25 m the soil in the experimental station is classified as sandy loam with a mean dry bulk density of 1 38 g cm 3 wilting point water content of 0 12 cm3 cm 3 and field water capacity water content of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 in the 0 1 m soil layer before sowing all plots were fertilized with 100 kg n ha 1 225 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 60 kg k2o ha 1 as basal fertilizers after fertilization the soil surface in each plot was partially covered with transparent plastic film polyethylene blown film 0 015 mm thick and 1 2 m wide shandong jining zhongqu double star plastic products factory jining china the width of the bare soil between the two strips of plastic film mulch was 0 4 m the drip irrigated plots with four rows of hybrid maize were top dressed with 100 kg n ha 1 during the vegetative and flowering stages the spacing of drip irrigation belts was 0 8 m the distance between emitters was 0 3 m and the flow rate was 2 5 l h 1 the total planting density of male and female inbreds was 9 75 plants m 2 the row spacing was 40 cm and the planting spacing was 25 cm for male and female inbreds to ensure the emergence of seedlings the female parents were irrigated with 30 mm immediately after sowing for all treatments during both years the cultivars planting dates of female parents first and second batch of male parents and planting proportions are given in table 1 maize was sown in one row of male parents with six rows of female parents in 2018 and one row of male parents with five rows of female parents in 2019 the two batches of male inbreds were planted in the same rows with six plants each from the first and second batches placed in an alternating pattern the female inbreds were detasseled on 3 july 2018 and 15 july 2019 and the harvesting dates were 17 sept in each year weeding and pest control measures followed local practices the study consisted of two experiments of which exp i was an irrigation experiment and exp ii added defoliation and restricted pollination treatments based on exp i in exp i 16 irrigation treatments during vegetative v flowering f and grain filling g stages were carried out each year the sufficient irrigation depth per event i was the difference between evapotranspiration and effective precipitation 5 mm wang et al 2021 the evapotranspiration was the product of the crop coefficient k c and reference crop evapotranspiration et0 where k c values were 0 33 0 90 1 10 1 02 and 0 80 at the seedling vegetative flowering grain filling and maturity stages respectively jiang 2016 and et0 was calculated by the meteorological data during the last irrigation period allen et al 1998 there were no irrigation treatments at the seedling and maturity stages the two irrigation levels applied at the vegetative stage were 100 i and 50 i and the three irrigation levels applied at the flowering and grain filling stages were 100 i 50 i and 0 i the irrigation depth and times during each growth stage in 2018 and 2019 are presented in table 2 under the control treatment v2f2g2 the maize inbred lines were irrigated every 10 days starting from june 5 2018 and june 4 2019 and all the irrigation events in the different treatments were made in the same day a randomized block design with three replicates per irrigation treatment was used the experimental plot size was 4 8 m wide and 46 m long and a buffer area 6 m wide and 46 m long separated the different treatments female inbreds were planted in the buffer zones in order to obtain the grain filling characteristics and aboveground plant biomass with different source sink relationships another experiment was added in 2019 in exp ii a split plot design was used to decrease the kernel number and assimilation during the effective grain filling phase the 16 irrigation treatments for exp i in 2019 were the main effects and a restricted pollination treatment and two defoliation treatments were secondary effects pollination was prevented in approximately 50 apical ears with paper bags two days after silking as a restricted pollination treatment about 10 leaves remained after detasseling of female inbreds and three and six leaves were removed from the top as the 30 and 60 defoliation treatments respectively under each treatment 50 female inbreds plants were defoliated 14 days after silking the exp ii was only used to establish the relationships between grain filling characteristics and plant growth rate under different irrigation treatments 30 female inbreds plants were tagged to record the dates of silking at least one silk exposed 1 cm from the husk silking date was the day when 50 of female inbreds reached silking every 4 7 days in each year four plants and 1500 kernels 300 kernels 5 replicates per treatment were dried in an oven at 85 c to a constant weight to obtain aboveground biomass and kw respectively the growth of kw was obtained using a bilinear plateau model 1 kw a b tt as tt as c a b c

calculated by the difference between c and lpd the soil water content was measured every 3 5 days using a diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd adelaide australia at a depth of 1 m in each plot two pvc tubes were installed below the bare soil and mulch and the measurements were calibrated by the gravimetric method fig 1 shows the trends of mean soil volumetric water content in the 0 1 m soil layer under different irrigation treatments in 2018 and 2019 the crop evapotranspiration was calculated as 2 et p e i w r d w where et is evapotranspiration mm p e is the effective precipitation mm i is the irrigation depth mm w is the supplement from groundwater mm r is the surface runoff mm d is the deep drainage mm and δw is the variation in soil water storage mm w is negligible because the groundwater table is below 25 m r is zero because the experimental site is flat d was ignored because the soil water content at the 0 9 1 0 m layer did not change before and after irrigation meteorological data were logged by an automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp bourne ma usa the meteorological data for both growth stages are shown in fig 2 2 2 kw water model the kw was estimated using the following equation echarte et al 2006 3 kw kgr egf egfd because the cultivars were different during the two years the values of kgregf egfd and plant growth rate per kernel after silking pgrkas mg c 1 d 1 were expressed relative to the control treatment v2f2g2 each year studies have shown that there is a linear relationship between kernel growth rate and plant growth rate gambín et al 2006 2008 borrás and gambín 2010 however when the assimilate availability approaches saturation the kernel growth rate reaches its maximum borrás et al 2004 therefore we developed a bilinear plateau model to establish the relationship between relative kgregf rkgregf and relative pgrkas rpgrkas 4 rkgr egf d e rpgrk as rpgrk as f d e f rpgrk as f 5 pgrk as δ b as tt as kn 10 3 in

rate per kernel after silking and grain filling characteristics the et kw lpd kgregf pgrkas and egfd are shown in table 3 because of the high rainfall during the grain filling stage in 2018 fig 1 there were no significant differences in et kw pgrkas kgregf and egfd under irrigation treatments at this stage the whole stage et ranged from 257 6 to 436 5 mm in 2018 and from 300 5 to 530 9 mm in 2019 and the kw ranged from 308 5 to 341 0 mg in 2018 and from 171 7 to 312 3 mg in 2019 a water deficit at vegetative and grain filling stages significantly reduced kw the treatment of v2f0g2 had the highest kw and increased by 1 7 in 2018 and 3 8 in 2019 compared to the control treatment v2f2g2 this result was similar to that of nesmith and ritchie 1992a borrás et al 2004 suggested that increasing the assimilate availability per kernel post flowering could only increase the kw marginally however when maize crops were exposed to the source strength reduction kw showed a large decrease compared to v2f2g2 et decreased by 16 6 and 19 3 in v2f0g2 treatment but pgrkas increased by 6 0 and 6 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the increasing assimilate availability per kernel after silking may be the reason for the increased kw under a water deficit at the flowering stage the plant growth rate per kernel is usually reduced with stress gambín et al 2008 severini et al 2011 pgrkas ranged from 0 463 to 0 569 mg c 1 d 1 in 2018 and 0 212 0 693 mg c 1 d 1 in 2019 a 50 water deficit at the vegetative stage shortened lpd significantly in both years but a 50 and 100 water deficit at flowering and grain filling stages had no effects on lpd except for v1f0g2 and v1f0g1 in 2018 a water deficit of 50 at the vegetative stage shortened egfd significantly in both years but decreased kgregf only in 2019 the kernel water content at the end of the lag phase is often used to estimate the kernel sink capacity borrás and gambín 2010 therefore the shorter lpd under a water deficit at the vegetative stage is one reason for the reduction of kw kgregf and egfd maddonni et al 1998 a water deficit of 50 and 100 at the grain filling stage decreased pgrkas kgregf and egfd in 2019 some studies showed that a water deficit at the grain filling stage significantly shortened the egpd by accelerating kernel desiccation but did not reduce kernel growth rate significantly ouattar et al 1987 nesmith and ritchie 1992b westgate 1994 sala et al 2007 in this study the shortage of assimilates caused by a water deficit at the grain filling stage may be the reason for the reduction in kgregf a water deficit at the flowering stage increased kgregf significantly but had no significant effects on egfd the increase in kw caused by a water deficit at the flowering stage was due to the increase in kgregf rather than increasing egfd gambín et al 2007 also suggested that increasing the assimilate availability per kernel did not increase egfd in maize 3 2 the relationships between grain filling characteristics and plant growth rate the bilinear plateau relationship between rkgregf and rpgrkas for exps i and ii is shown in fig 4a rkgregf increased with increasing rpgrkas when rpgrkas 1 06 rkgregf 1 03 which is the potential rkgregf when rpgrkas 0 rkgregf 0 67 which is rkgregf of δb as 0 the logistic relationship between regfd and rpgrkas rkgregf fitted by the data of exps i and ii is shown in fig 4b the regfd increased as rpgrkas rkgregf increased when rpgrkas rkgregf approached infinity regfd 1 03 which was a potential regfd when rpgrkas rkgregf 0 regfd 0 73 which is the regfd of δb as 0 the amount of assimilates available per kernel during lag phase determines the endosperm cell number and potential kw jones et al 1996 borrás and westgate 2006 borrás and gambín 2010 studies have shown that the plant growth rate around flowering is positively correlated with kernel growth rate but plant growth rate during the effective grain filling stage had little effect on kernel growth rate andrade and ferreiro 1996 echarte et al 2006 gambín et al 2006 2008 borrás and gambín 2010 although the potential kernel size has been established at the end of the lag phase reducing the amount of assimilates during the effective filling phase such as defoliation and shading will disrupt the source sink balance borrás and gambín 2010 in this study the plant growth rate after silking was used to establish a relationship with kgregf fig 4a which considered the source sink changes throughout the total grain filling phase the egfd is affected by the source sink ratio during the grain filling period cirilo and andrade 1996 borrás and otegui 2001 echarte et al 2006 gambín et al 2006 suggested that egfd tended to be longer for genotypes with higher ratios between plant growth rate per kernel and kernel growth rate during the effective grain filling period which is consistent with our results when δb as 0 the kernel growth is mainly restricted by the source and the assimilates stored in vegetative organs of the plant are transferred to kernels uhart and andrade 1995 wang et al 2019 suggested that the upper limit of kw was 178 4 mg and the lower limit of kw was 155 6 mg when the post flowering biomass gain of hybrid maize seed production was zero in this study when δb as 0 kw 164 0 and 147 2 mg in 2018 and 2019 respectively borrás et al 2004 showed that the kw increased by 16 at the assimilate availability per kernel saturation during the grain filling stage we found that the potential kernel weights were 355 6 and 319 3 mg in each year and increased by 6 1 compared with the control treatment 3 3 modeling biomass characteristic parameters and kernel weight under different irrigation treatments the models of rao jensen and minhas were used to simulate the biomass characteristic parameters b m k and t the water sensitivity indices of biomass characteristic parameters at vegetative flowering and grain filling stages calibrated for 12 irrigation treatments during both years are shown in table 4 for b m the highest r 2 of 0 93 and the lowest rrmse of 0 042 were obtained for the jensen model the b m was found to be more sensitive to a water deficit at the grain filling stage than the vegetative and flowering stages for k the jensen model produced the highest r 2 of 0 97 and the lowest rrmse of 0 035 the negative values of water sensitivity indices indicated that a water deficit at each growth stage increased k for t the minhas model gave the highest r 2 of 0 92 and the lowest rrmse of 0 008 the lower values of water sensitivity indices at each growth stage indicated that a water deficit had little effect on t the measured biomass characteristic parameters and the predicted values by different models validated by 20 irrigation treatments during both years are shown in fig 5 although the rao model had the best validation results for b m the jensen model had the highest r 2 ef and d ia and the lowest are for k and t among the three models therefore the jensen model was the most suitable for simulating aboveground biomass gain after silking water production functions are often used to describe the relationship between crop yield and evapotranspiration at different growth stages chen et al 2014 developed water production functions to predict the fruit quality of tomatoes under a water deficit at different growth stages wang et al 2018 used water production functions to estimate the flowering characteristics of hybrid maize seed production under a water deficit at different growth stages in this study the forms of water production functions were used to quantify the relationships between biomass characteristic parameters b m k and t and crop evapotranspiration at the vegetative flowering and grain filling stages using the jensen model to simulate aboveground biomass gain after silking the fitted results of the kw water model are shown in fig 6 kw was underestimated by 1 under different irrigation treatments the kw water model performed well in predicting the kw of hybrid maize seed production over a wide range 171 7 340 2 mg and it can be used to simulate kw under different water regimes in arid regions our previous results indicated that a water deficit at the flowering stage improved seed vigor by increasing kw and water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages reduced seed vigor by decreasing kw shi et al 2020 therefore combined with the water flowering model wang et al 2018 to predict kernel number the optimal irrigation depth at the different growth stages to ensure yield and seed vigor of hybrid maize under a water deficit must be investigated in next research plan 4 conclusions this study was conducted to investigate the effects of water deficit at different growth stages on grain filling characteristics of hybrid maize seed production and to simulate kernel weight kw under a water deficit by kernel growth rate during effective grain filling kgregf and effective grain filling duration egfd research has shown that a 50 water deficit at the vegetative stage shortened egfd and the lag phase duration while a 100 water deficit at the flowering stage increased kw because of the increase in plant growth rate per kernel after silking pgrkas we established a bilinear plateau relationship between relative kgregf rkgregf and relative pgrkas rpgrkas and a logistic relationship between relative egfd and rpgrkas rkgregf the jensen model was the best for predicting biomass characteristic parameters to obtain aboveground biomass gains after silking the kw water model performed well in predicting the kw of hybrid maize seed production and underestimated by 1 under different water regimes our research is useful for

10126,climate variability and changing cropping patterns are two main factors directly influencing catchment hydrological processes and agricultural productivity assessing the response of hydrological processes and agricultural production to the combined impacts is of great importance for enhancing water resources management water productivity and agriculture sustainability swat soil and water assessment tools models embedded with 2007 and 2018 land use were built for the san joaquin watershed sjws in california s central valley global sensitivity analysis were conducted to select

crops using county level reported yields during the periods of 2001 2009 and 2010 2018 based on the outputs of the calibrated sjws swat model regional et showed a significant increase which was caused by rises in temperature and changing cropping patterns associated with increase in area under nut crop production seven major crop yields increased excluding alfalfa implying that the impacts of increasing temperature and small decreases in precipitation were not dominant factors in explaining observed changes in yield from periods 2001 2009 2010 2018 total water productivity wp increased slightly from 2 11 to 2 15 kg m3 associated with more water intensive permanent crop production systems total economic water productivity ewp increased significantly by 111 from 0 55 to 1 16 us m3 which also indicated the substantial economic benefit brought to the sjws by expanding the land area under high ewp crops such as nut crops and vegetables nutritional water productivity nwp for energy protein and fat were reduced from 1211 kcal m3 183 g m3 and 105 g m3 to 1141 kcal m3 111 g m3 and 88 g m3 during the period 2010 2018 mostly due to high water use total nwp for calcium was increased from 114 to 145 mg m3 respectively this study provides initial insights into the response of wp ewp and nwp to the changing cropping patterns and climate variability for major crops in the sjws which could be used by a wide range of stakeholders including farmers commodity boards irrigation districts groundwater sustainability basins environmental justice groups and policy makers to optimize water

regional spatial temporal variations in et and wp which could help with wp improvement and water resources management it is widely agreed that changing climate and cropping patterns may both alter hydrologic processes and agricultural production in predominantly agricultural watersheds according to the pachauri et al 2014 a rise of about 0 85 0 65 1 06 c global temperature was detected over the period 1880 2012 and higher temperatures are expected to affect all aspects of the hydrological cycle rising temperature and decreasing precipitation will result in decreased river runoff aquifer

increasing food supply to meet demand cannot be achieved by expanding agricultural land area because of the scarce natural resource and fierce competition for water among agricultural industrial environmental domestic water use and other uses which makes the possibility of expanding irrigated agriculture unlikely carruthers et al 1997 thus farmers commonly reduce the irrigation water use and shift the area of water intensive crops to ones with efficient water use or higher economic value sun et al 2015 human induced cropping pattern changes could affect the hydrological processes such as et surface runoff interception and infiltration zhang et al 2016 vaghefi et al 2015 mahesh 1999 and agricultural production such as crop yield and wp li et al 2009 thus evaluating the impacts of climate variability and cropping patterns change on et and wp variations could help shade light on optimum uses of water resources in agriculture hydrological modelling provides a physical based framework to investigate the relationships between climate variability and land use change on hydrologic processes crop production and water productivity numerous researchers have used hydrologic

cropping patterns and groundwater depth in a large irrigation district of yellow river basin in china and no significant changes in et were detected at from 2000 to 2015 in spite of the substantial changes in cropping patterns li et al 2009 concluded that changing climate had more significant impacts on hydrological processes compared to changing land use in the loess plateau of china vaghefi et al 2015 recommended cropping pattern changes as an effective tool that could be adapted to offset the negative impacts of climate variability on crop production the sjws of california s central valley produces a significant portion of total us agricultural production van lienden et al 2014 zelezny et al 2015 the major crops grown in the watershed include nuts vegetables cotton fruits and field crops the watershed is highly agricultural and a large part of the population of the area is involved in all aspects of agricultural production ficklin et al 2009 recently stress on the water supply system is growing with limited surface water used for irrigation due to worsening droughts many farmers turned to groundwater under constrained water supplies farmers changed cropping patterns to respond to reduced water supplies or market prices hanak et al 2019 for example the southwestern portion of the sjws has long been known for its cotton production with cotton prices dropping in recent years large areas under cotton were shifted to other crops such as almonds walnuts etc also many farmers have planted lower water use crops or increased fallowing to reduce irrigation needs during a particular year studies in sjws were mainly about impacts of climate variability temperature precipitation and co2 on hydrological processes components especially surface runoff ficklin et al 2009 2010 he et al 2012 and the eco environmental system quinn et al 2001 hidalgo et al 2006 ficklin et al 2013 studies on effects of land use change on hydrological processes and eco environment were also conducted by sobota et al 2009 and zhen et al 2010 studies assessing the impacts of climate variability and land use change on water productivity at a regional scale are not available in literature for the sjws there is a great need for quantifying the impacts of changing climate and cropping patterns on evapotranspiration and water productivity for various crops grown in the sjws to support water resources planning and to foster sustainable agricultural water management the soil and water assessment tool swat is a physically based semi distributed eco hydrologic model developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars to predict the impact of agricultural or land management on hydrological hydrochemical and biophysical processes at the

geographic information system gis using an interface called arcswat to support the preparation of input data winchell et al 2008 swat has also been integrated with qgis objectives of this study were to 1 analyze trends in climate variability and changes in cropping patterns in the sjws during the period of 1999 2018 2 perform calibration and validation of the sjws swat model for et and crop yield

land use types in sjws include cropland pasture based livestock farming and forests about 7400 km2 is occupied by pasture and 1100 km2 is occupied by forest chen et al 2017 with about 38 of its total cropland covered by nuts and fruits about 36 covered by field crops such as corn tomato cotton beans etc and less than 10 covered by grain crops california department of water resources dwr 2007 the sjws has a typical mediterranean climate with cool rainy winters and hot dry summers its annual average rainfall ranges from 200 to 300 mm and most of the rainfall occurs from november to april and very little rainfall between may to october national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2008 the soil type is mostly clay loam to fine sandy loams the san joaquin river originates from the sierra nevada mountains and flows northwest before reaching the sacramento san joaquin delta san joaquin river at vernalis is defined as the watershed outlet which is shown in fig 1 agriculture in the sjws depends highly on irrigation due to its arid climatic conditions a combination of surface water and groundwater is used by local famers to meet their irrigation needs public water distribution projects such as the state water project and the central valley project are used to deliver water to end users with long term water contracts in 2014 california passed the sustainable groundwater management act sgma that created a framework for local and regional management of groundwater with the goal of achieving sustainable groundwater in california by 2042 this act forces farmers to adapt to constrained water supplies when the new regulations are fully implemented 2 2 swat model description a detailed description of swat can be found in nietsch et al 2005 in this section we provide a brief description related to hydrological processes and crop growth based on the topography and stream network swat partitions a watershed into multiple sub watersheds which are then divided into multiple hydrological response units hrus as the basic simulation units for swat hru is defined as a homogeneous spatial unit characterized by a unique combination of homogeneous soil slope and land use types flügel 1995 users could specify the thresholds of land use soil and slope to limit the number of hrus in each sub watershed which could greatly reduce the model running time while maintaining the model simulation accuracy regional hydrological process components such as soil water content et surface runoff percolation groundwater flow etc are calculated independently in each hru on the basis of the water balance method the swat provides several options when simulating hydrologic processes which can be chosen by users based on their data availability in our study we selected the penman monteith method monteith 1965 in swat to calculate et with the requirement of solar radiation relative humidity air temperature and wind speed the plant growth module of swat is a simplified version of the environmental policy integrated calculator epic crop model williams et al 1984 leaf area development biomass accumulation and crop yield are simulated in this module for different crop species 2 3 data input and model setup in this study arcswat version 2012 was applied the main input data for swat are dem describing topography land use map soil map weather data and land and management data which are summarized in table 1 table 2 lists the detailed information of 10 noaa ncdc weather stations in the sjws two swat models were built in this study based on all the same model inputs except for the land use the land use maps of 2007 and 2018 representing the cropping patterns of periods 1999 2009 and 2010 2018 were adopted in these two models respectively although using dynamic land use maps for each year would provide a more accurate representation of the actual land use however a single land use map still could be very useful to represent an entire simulation period ranging from several years to decades especially for those areas with no access to annually dynamic land use map also land use under perennial crops does not change annually due to multiyear life cycle of these crops based on the usda national agricultural statistic service nass statistical results the acreage change in most of the 8 major crops were detected as significant between 1999 and 2018 meanwhile the earliest land use map sourced from the usda nass cropland data layer was in 2007 thus we used land use maps for 2007 and 2018 to investigate cropping pattern changes in this study 2007 and 2018 land use maps both include 16 same land use types which are alfalfa alfa almond almd pistachio pist walnut waln grape grap cotton cotp corn silage csil processing tomato toma agricultural land row crops agrr fallow crop land barr forest frst pasture past wetland wetl shrubland rngb urban urbn and water watr fig 2 in addition to the 8 main crops all the other cropland planted with different crops were reclassified into agrr in this study due to their small area ratio the sjws was divided into 29 sub basins and these sub basins were further subdivided into 920 hrus and 1032 hrus for model with land use of 2007 and 2018 respectively in our study only land use soil and slopes with over 5 coverage of the sub basin were used for hru definition which could eliminate minor slope soil and land use classes with the first two years as warm up period the simulations for swat models with 2007 and 2018 land use maps were performed from 1999 to 2009 and 2008 2018 respectively weather data including daily precipitation the maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and relative humidity for the period of 1999 2018 were obtained from 10 noaa ncdc weather stations located in the sjws these stations were evenly distributed and both cultivated area and forest were considered in selecting weather stations which better captured the spatial distribution of precipitation and eliminated the errors in input precipitation and temperature caused by elevations overall higher elevation will bring higher precipitation and lower temperature epelde et al 2015 for those missing data in these ncds weather datasets gridded 1 km 1 km weather data from nasapower were adopted in this study agricultural management practices for 8 major crops including planting irrigation fertilization and harvesting were determined according to the state level crop progress from the usda nass quick stats 2 0 and recommendations from relevant agricultural specialists nass reports weekly farmer activities and crop growth stages at the state level thus in the swat model agricultural management practices for each crop were uniformly applied for a given crop this may differ from grower to grower actual practices in sjws which introduces a bias in the hydrological and production simulations in addition the swat model was run for agrr and other uncultivated land use types based on default management parameters 2 4 model calibration 2 4 1 remotely sensed et based on pysebal model we used remotely sensed et estimated using pysebal to calibrate the swat based et pysebal unesco ihe 2018 a new version of the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal developed in python environment provides daily et mm d estimates using different satellite imagery sources more details about the algorithms in the pysebal can be obtained from hessels et al 2017 with clear sky conditions 146 path 43 row 34 landsat 7 etm c1 level 1 imageries during 1999 2012 and 74 path 43 row 34 landsat 8 oli tirs c1 level 1 imageries during 2013 2018 were obtained from the usgs eros center http eros usgs gov the images were used to estimate daily et on satellite overpass dates due to the scan line corrector on landsat 7 failing on may 31 of 2003 a gap filling product extension tool in envi was used in this study to provide complete ground coverage for the downloaded landsat 7 etm imageries from 2003 to 2012 as the input data of pysebal daily and hourly gridded weather datasets including precipitation relative humidity air temperature incoming solar radiation and wind speed were collected from nasa power stackhouse et al 2018 and gldas rodell et al 2004 products to estimate the monthly et for the sjws rs based daily et values were linearly interpolated between two adjacent satellite overpasses and time series of daily et values were then reconstructed using the time interpolation module embedded in pysebal for better model adaptability daily pysebal based et values were compared to the 1 km gridded daily modis product mod16a2 usgs lp daac 2020 and the ground based et values from ameriflux law 2005 at the beginning to get the input parameters of pysebal optimized as the summation of daily et values pysebal based monthly et from 2001 to 2018 were finally used for swat based et calibration 2 4 2 county level crop yield statistics county level yield data for the major crops in the sjws were collected for the period of 1999 2018 from the usda nass based on the cropping patterns of the year 2007 and 2018 8 major crops alfalfa almond pistachio walnut grapes cotton corn silage and processing tomato with the highest planting acreage in the sjws were included in this study swat reports crop yields in units of kilograms of dry biomass per hectare and most of the usda nass crop yields reported could be treated as dry weights of biomass thus most of the nass crop yields could be compared directly to the swat crop yields by converting their units accordingly corn silage reported by usda nass tend to have a high moisture content thus its yield predictions from swat was multiplied by a factor of 1 65 for comparison to usda nass corn silage yield lauer 2006 as a fruit crop the yield of processing tomato reported by usda nass is considered as fresh weight while the swat simulated yield of processing tomato is dry weight a conversion factor of dry weight to fresh weight as 13 1 is considered for the comparison of these two yield datasets klemenčič and bulc 2015 2 5 climate variability and trend analysis in order to assess climate variability during the period of 1999 2018 the non parametric mann kendall mk trend test was used in this study to analyze the variation in trend of annual mean temperature and total precipitation from 10 weather stations in the sjws table 1 the mk test statistic was calculated following burn 1994 pohlert 2016 1 z s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 2 s j 1 n 1 i j 1 n sgn x i x j 3 sgn x i x j 1 if x i x j 0 0 if x i x j 0 1 if x i x j 0 4 var s n n 1 2 n 5 t t t 1 2 t 5 18 where x i and x j are two sequential data values and n is the length of the data set the value of s represents the number of positive differences minus the number of negative differences in the analyzed time series under the null hypothesis there is no trend in the data and no correlation between the analyzed variable and time which means each ordering of the data set could be considered equally t is the extent of any given ties and σt refers to the summation of all ties z is the standard normal variate which is used to evaluate the presence of a statistically significant trend a positive z indicates an increasing trend in the time series while a negative z indicates a decreasing trend the null hypothesis is accepted only if the absolute value of z is less than z 1 p 2 which could be obtained from standard normal cumulative distribution tables table s1 lists the z value at significance level of 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 which were applied in this study also another index named kendall slope was also used in mk test in this study and it quantifies the magnitude of the monotonic trend as follows 5 β median x i x j i j where β is the median over all combination of record pairs for the dataset similar to z a positive β also indicates an upward trend and a negative β indicates a downward trend 2 6 model calibration validation and parameter sensitivity analysis et and crop yield are important components for the calculation of crop wp thus calibration and validation of et and crop yield were both conducted in this study sensitivity analysis of parameters involved in et processes were conducted in the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 module embedded in swat cup software abbaspour 2013 global sensitivity analysis based on latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method was adopted in this study to identify the parameters to be calibrated van griensven et al 2006 the impact of each parameter on the model results was quantified and ranked from high to low and parameters to which the model was most sensitive were identified seventeen hydrological parameters were included in the sensitivity analysis for et estimation monthly et data for the period from 2010 to 2018 were used for calibration and data for the period from 2001 to 2009 were used for validation in this study the main variables of interest were et and wp thus only sub basins with more than 70 land use as cultivated area were selected as representative sub basins for et calibration and validation also considering the differences in land use maps for calibration lu map in year of 2018 and validation lu map in year of 2007 monthly et from 16 sub basins and 13 sub basins were finally used for calibration and validation respectively the remotely sensed monthly et are gridded data with 30 m 30 m spatial resolution these et maps were geo referenced and spatially aggregated into each of the 29 sub basins in arcgis only values of remotely sensed monthly et for those selected sub basins were used as the observed et in the spatially distributed calibration and validation processes parameters involved in et process were determined based on the results of sensitivity analysis and some parameters having insignificant impacts on et prediction were ignored the calibration of major crop yields was manually performed after the et calibration was completed by changing 12 parameters which control the development of crop biomass leaf area index crop height and crop yield nair et al 2011 four counties including madera merced fresno and stanislaus were considered in this study and some other counties san joaquin county and mariposa county that have only small ratio of cultivated area in the sjws were excluded swat yield predictions are based on hru while usda nass reports yields at county level this spatial scale difference in observed versus simulated yields creates difficulties in comparing yields directly thus all the swat based simulated yield at hru level were aggregated and up scaled to county level yield in arcgis based on their acreage ratio in each county using the weighted summation method in swat 12 selected parameters were manually adjusted one at time for yield calibration for example the light extinction coefficient ext coef is one of the important parameters for simulating the potential increase in biomass on a given day with a default value of 0 65 however for different crop species ext coef was varied goodness of fit indicators including coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe coefficient nse root mean square error rmse root mean square percentage error rmspe bibby and toutenburg 1977

model outputs respectively r is the linear correlation between measurements and simulations σ s and σ m indicate the standard deviation in simulations and measurements respectively the r 2 describes the proportion of the variance in the measured data that is explained by the model with a range between 0 and 1 with a range from to 1 the nse 1 indicates a perfect match between measurements and simulations and the value between 0 and 1 are usually considered as an acceptable level of model performance negative nse value indicates unacceptable performance when the observed mean is a better indicator than the model simulations the rmse indicates a good match between measurements and simulations when it approaches 0 and higher rmse indicates large errors between model simulations and measurements rmspe comprises three sources of error including errors due to bias deviation of the regression slope from 1 and random error which could allow readers to make a visual comparisons between model outputs with different scales kge is an increasingly used indicator for model calibration it decomposes nse into three constitutive components including correlation variability bias and mean bias which could address existing perceived shortcomings in nse negative kge values similar with negative nse values also imply the poor model performance rogelis et al 2016 and knoben et al 2019 both consider model performance to be good for kge 0 5 sutanudjaja et al 2018 only considered catchments where kge 0 as places where their model was successfully applied moriasi et al 2015 summarized the results of statistical analyses on the pbias for hydrological and water quality model s calibration and validation at different spatial and temporal scales for monthly simulated components at watershed scale acceptable pbias ranges from 38 4 53 1 with its mean value at 7 51 2 7 assessing variability in et crop yield wp ewp and nwp as affected by climate variability and changes in cropping patterns meteorological data of two time periods including 2001 2009 and 2010 2018 and cropping patterns of 2007 and 2018 were adopted in the two calibrated sjws swat models with the same set of calibrated parameters based on the calibrated sjws swat model not only water balance components including surface runoff soil water and evapotranspiration were simulated but also crop yield and wp were also simulated this makes the sjws swat model a valuable tool for exploring how regional et crop yield and wp responds to the climate variability and cropping patterns changes which in turn could provide further insights into the underlying drivers of the local agricultural development for the evaluation of yield wp and ewp of the 8 major crops only the yield of each crop and the prices of the saleable parts for each crop were considered in this study according to nass s annual crop report manual nass 2020 for three nut trees kernel yield hull yield for almond and in shell yield for pistachio and walnut with their corresponding prices were considered for cotton lint yield and seed yield and their prices were considered for corn silage processing tomato and grapes the fresh market yield and the corresponding prices were considered for alfalfa dry biomass weight and its price were considered to comprehensively explain the productivity of water and reach a wider audience for this study the evaluations of wp ewp and nwp during the period of 2001 2018 were described by eqs 12 15 according to fao 2002 energy protein and fat are three main metrics among numerous nutritional components of food which should be considered in evaluating the nwp we also considered calcium in this study because it is a vital element for preventing people from malnutrition renault and wallender

parts of a crop and its corresponding market prices us t e g for almond y 1 and y 2 are kernel yield and hull yield respectively and for cotton y 1 and y 2 are lint yield and seed yield respectively nwp is the nutritional water productivity nutrition unit m3 and np is the nutrition content contained in 1 kg of product nutrition unit kg and for detailed information on np including energy protein fat and calcium content per unit of weight for different crops the reader is referred to fao balance sheets 2002 and dunne 1990 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessing changes in cropping patterns table 3 lists all the land use types in the sjws for 2007 and 2018 that were considered in this study the farmland area occupied about 34 and 40 of the entire area in the sjws for 2007 and 2018 respectively three main trends in cropping pattern changes were detected during 2007 2018 increase in the acreage of nut trees fruits and vegetables and the decrease in the acreage of conventional field crops and the increase of fallow cropland almonds pistachios walnuts grapes and processing tomatoes increased by 47 117 74 45 and 12 respectively in 2018 compared to 2007 cotton corn silage and alfalfa decreased by 35 50 and 29 from 2007 to 2018 the change in acreage of various crops in the sjws indicates a shift towards high value crops such as nuts fruits vegetables and other specialty crops and away from conventional low value field crops including corn cotton and wheat johnson and cody 2015 reported that there has been a continued shift toward growing more permanent orchard crops such as fruit nut trees and vineyard in some parts of california central valley although these orchard crops often require long periods before first harvest their relatively higher market prices drive farmers to plant these crops another factor driving changes in cropping patterns is increasing constraints on water supplies causing growers to fallow more land 3 2 climate variability trend analysis table s2 shows the trend statistic for annual average temperature and precipitation during the period 1999 2018 of the ten weather stations four are located in the cultivated area in the middle of the sjws while the other six stations are located in the uncultivated area forests at higher elevations for temperature there was a significant increase for all the ten weather stations from 1999 to 2018 with significance level less than 0 1 the increasing trend in annual mean temperature for five of these ten stations reached a significance level of p 0 01 according to the kendall slopes all the four weather stations located in cultivated area tended to decrease during the period of 1999 2018 while the other six weather stations located in forest did not show a consistent decreasing or increasing trend the changing trend in annual precipitation for all the ten weather stations were not significant for the period of 1999 2018 thus the above results suggest that climate in the sjws was getting warmer cultivated area in the sjws tended to be drier while uncultivated area especially forestry area had higher precipitation annual mean temperature for 2010 2018 increased by 3 c relative to the period from 2001 to 2009 such climate variability would influence hydrological processes such as surface runoff and et an increase of annual temperature would result in an increase of et in the cultivated areas because higher amounts of energy are available to convert liquid water in the soil and plant to water vapor and the rate of et will increase consequently 3 3 sensitivity analysis calibration and validation for et and crop yields the sensitivity analysis results for the et processes are listed in table 4 among the two indicators of parameter sensitivity t stat represents the degree of sensitivity and p value represents the significance of t stat a higher absolute value of t implies a more sensitive parameter and the closer the p value to 0 the less the probability of accidentally assigning a parameter as sensitive in this study 14 parameters with the absolute value of t stat higher than 0 5 were selected as relatively sensitive for the estimation of et in the sjws swat model thus the calibration and validation of et would include these 14 parameters in this study table 5 provides initial range and the calibrated values of the 14 selected parameters involved in the et calibration and validation as mentioned above the monthly et calibration and validation were conducted using sufi 2 in swat cup for the 16 and 13 sub basins in 2010 2018 and 2001 2009 respectively the comparison of monthly simulated et and remotely sensed et with corresponding goodness of fit performance statistics are presented in fig 3 fig s1 provides the temporal variation in monthly swat based et and the remotely sensed et for both calibration and validation periods the range of r 2 nse rmse kge and pbias for the 15 sub basins in the calibration were 0 79 0 91 0 69 0 90 13 23 24 36 0 55 0 92 and 12 78 22 84 respectively only sub basin no 27 showed a relatively low performance of monthly et estimation with these indicators with values of 0 79 0 39 25 68 0 48 and 49 47 which could mostly be attributed to a low cultivated area ratio of 41 for sub basin 27 in 2007 land use map in this study only parameters related to et processes and crop production for 8 major crops were selected for calibration and default swat parameters for land use types except cultivated area were adopted in model setup this could result in discrepancy between simulated swat based et and rs based et on non agricultural land uses for 11 of the 13 sub basins in the validation period these indicators were 0 69 0 90 0 61 0 85 14 22 28 93 0 51 0 76 and 15 36 26 74 respectively the comparison of simulated and remotely sensed monthly et in sub basins no 19 and no 26 showed acceptable agreement with rmse of 28 52 mm and 35 5 mm and pbias valued in 51 54 and 50 89 respectively sub basin no 27 showed better performance during validation period probably due to an increase ratio of its cultivated area compared to calibration period according to the model evaluation performance criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2015 the sjws swat model provided overall good estimations of spatially distributed monthly et for both calibration and validation periods fig s1 also demonstrates that the sjws swat model captures the temporal monthly et dynamics very well the results for crop yield calibration and validation are shown in table 6 the 12 parameters involved in the simulation of crop leaf area index height biomass and yield for the major crops in this study are shown in table 6 the last parameter bmx trees in table 6 pertains to trees only thus it is a very important parameter for yield calibration in an area with lots of fruit and nut trees according to the calibration results most of the default base growth temperature t base of each crop was modified to a lower value and the harvest index hvsti was increased for trees almond pistachio walnut and grape corn silage processing tomato while hvsti for alfalfa and cotton were left at their default values these 12 parameters were modified within a reasonable range 30 for all the other 7 main crops except for processing tomatoes the parameters and algorithms in the epic crop model embedded in swat for toma defaulted to fresh market tomato which finally resulted in a substantial adjustment in the selected parameters in table 6 to make the crop yield calibration satisfactory southern san joaquin valley management practices evaluation program committee 2017 also pointed out several specific refinements in swat using new information among which revisions of several crop growth models including processing tomatoes were required to allow swat model to better reflect the intensive high yielding systems that are common in the california s central valley it is worth noting that the crop models in swat are simplistic and do not simulate detailed crop growth processes such as photosynthesis or respiration but if well calibrated can produce acceptable results particularly under non stress conditions detailed crop modeling with models e g using apsim dssat rzwqm swap designed to simulate detailed processes such as photosynthesis and respiration have a large number of parameters and demand a large amount of data for calibration and validation such amounts of data are not usually available when simulating crop growth processes at a landscape scale motha 2011 kisekka et al 2016 the comparison between the annual simulated and observed crop yields at county level for 8 major crops are shown in fig 4 swat simulated crop yields matched well with the nass reported values although low nse values less than 0 2 were detected for corn silage and processing tomato the goodness of fit statistical performance indicators showed that the rmspe for the 8 major crops in the four counties were less than 20 and the absolute values of pbias were less than 6 the kge values were above 0 49 for all 8 major crops in the four counties the unknown moisture content of corn silage and processing tomato in the nass reports and the previously mentioned simplistic crop growth models in swat could be the primary causes of the relatively poor prediction of corn silage and processing tomatoes and due to the lack of actual historical data on agricultural management practices misrepresenting these model inputs could greatly affect the yield estimations overall the annual yield estimations of the 8 major crops in this study were well simulated in four counties in the sjws 3 4 assessing variations in et crop yield wp ewp and nwp under climate variability and changing cropping patterns as mentioned in section 2 5 only sub basins with more than 70 land use classified as cultivated area were selected as representative agricultural sub basins based on the sjws model outputs annual et for these 13 agricultural based sub basins from 2001 to 2018 is summarized in fig 5 the mann kendall trend test was adopted to assess the temporal trend of annual et which indicated that et had a significantly increasing trend p 0 05 for these 13 sub basins the range in temporal averaged et increased from 379 738 mm for the period 2001 2009 to 505 891 mm for period 2010 2018 the combined effect of changing cropping patterns and climate variability increased regional et by 25 compared to the previous 9 years according to the cropping pattern change results in table 3 an increase increased by 103 in area under fallow and a decrease decreased by 50 in area of the largest single consumer of water alfalfa were detected in the sjws in the latter 9 years 2010 2018 which would have resulted in a decrease in et however an increase in area of water intensive crops such as nut trees including almonds pistachios and walnuts could be the main reason for the increased regional et in the sjws among these cropping patterns changes the planting area under almonds and walnuts were substantially increased by 47 and 74 respectively and that of pistachios even doubled when compared to the period of 2001 2009 a report from the pacific institution noted that almonds along with pistachios are among the top consumers of water they consume about 41 64 million cubic meter of water per year gleick 2015 reisman 2020 grower focused organizations such as the almond board of california have prioritized the need to reduce the amount of water needed to grow a unit of nuts by 20 by the year 2025 almond board of california 2019 as mentioned in section 2 3 agricultural management practices including irrigation fertilization and harvesting for a given crop were applied uniformly in swat thus the spatiotemporal variation in et crop yield and wp were considered to only be caused by climate variability and cropping patterns changes fig s2 shows the temporal variation in crop yields for 8 major crops in the sjws for the period 2001 2018 compared to the period of 2001 2009 the average yield of almonds kernel hull pistachio in shell walnut in shell grapes fresh cotton lint seed corn silage fresh and processing tomato fresh in the sjws for period of 2010 2018 were increased from 6 39 2 91 4 61 24 92 4 51 64 13 and 92 71 t ha to 7 89 3 23 4 45 25 67 5 63 64 51 128 98 t ha the mann kendall trend test results showed that yields of all these 7 major crops had an increasing trend except for alfalfa under impacts of the significantly rising temperature and insignificant changes in precipitation in general increasing temperature tend to result in higher crop water consumption thus result in a higher crop yield if water is non limiting trends in yields varied greatly from significant to not significant which may be attributed to the differences in crop growth responses to the impacts of temperature on yield formation processes previous studies have shown that rising temperatures may have a positive or negative effect on alfalfa yield depending on the real time climatic conditions at a given location the species specific temperature range suitable for growth and photosynthesis and soil resources hatfield et al 2011 lee et al 2013 thivierge et al 2016 from period 2001 2009 to 2010 2018 reductions in alfalfa yields from 18 70 to 18 02 t ha under increasing temperature and relatively small decreases in precipitation could be supported by the conclusions of previous studies on alfalfa yield reduction under warmer and drier environments fig 6 shows the temporal variation in wp for each major crop and the total wp summarizing the wp of 8 major crops based on their planting area ratio during the period of 2001 2018 in the sjws the mann kendall trend test results indicated that seven crops excluding alfalfa all had a significant increasing trend in wp while alfalfa had a significant decreasing trend in wp p 0 01 the comprehensive total wp of 8 major crops in the sjws show an insignificantly increasing trend this may due to the change of cropping patterns including the greatly increased planting area of nut trees while their wp were relatively small compared to other crops compared to the period 2001 2009 the average wp during the period 2010 2018 for almonds kernel hull pistachios in shell walnuts in shell grapes fresh cotton lint seed corn silage fresh and processing tomatoes fresh increased from 0 69 0 28 0 48 4 48 0 52 9 32 10 87 and 0 23 0 83 0 35 0 45 4 67 0 62 9 82 14 55 and 0 28 kg m3 respectively wp for alfalfa decreased by 8 from 2 16 to 1 98 kg m3 as an index reflecting the combined positive and negative impacts of climate variability and changing cropping patterns total wp for 8 major crops was only slightly increased from 2 11 to 2 15 on one hand increasing temperatures in the agricultural areas of the sjws will increase the crop water use and yield which could improve the wp for each crop due to the highly positive correlation between crop yield and wp on the other hand substantial increase in the acreage of water intensive nut trees with low wp values will eventually reduce the regional total productivity per unit of water consumed fig s3 shows the correlations between crop wp and yield for 8 major crops in the sjws which also shows the strong relevance between crop yield and wp the value of r 2 for almonds pistachios walnuts cotton and processing tomatoes were all above 0 9 which means that crop yield is the dominate factor in determining wp besides the wp of each crop farmers would also take into consideration the ewp as a key factor determining which crops to grow ewp is an index considering production crop water use cropping patterns and crop prices thus the crop price fluctuations from year to year were included in ewp for each crop in this study we did not separate the impact of crop price fluctuations from climate variability and cropping patterns changes in this study fig 7 shows the temporal variation in ewp during the period 2001 2018 for the 8 major crops and a comprehensive indicator named total ewp representing ewp for all these 8 major crops based on their acreage ratio the top five crops with relatively high ewp are pistachios almonds grapes walnuts and processing tomatoes their planted area were increased substantially from the period 2001 2009 to period 2010 2018 cotton corn silage and alfalfa had relatively low ewp in the sjws overall the ewp for all the 8 major crops was improved greatly from the former 9 years to the latter 9 years due to the increasing market prices nass 2020 despite their low wp nut trees including almonds pistachios and walnuts produced substantially higher economic return per cubic of water use which made them more popular crop choices among farmers in the sjws during this period fig 7 the average ewp for almonds pistachios and walnuts were increased from 0 83 0 92 and 0 72 during the period 2001 2009 to 1 44 1 64 and 1 13 us m3 during the period 2010 2018 as a less water intensive crop compared to nut trees grapes also produced higher ewp which increased from 0 94 us m3 during the period 2001 2018 1 70 us m3 alfalfa as the most water intensive crop among the 8 major crops had a relatively low average ewp of 0 29 us m3 for the period from 2001 to 2009 and 0 4 us m3 for the period of 2010 2018 thus under the warmer and drier climate and expensive scare water resources during the period 2001 2018 it was reasonable that more farmers shifted from growing field crops to high value nuts and grapes low ewp of cotton mean value as 0 34 us m3 for 2001 2009 and 0 57 us m3 for 2010 2018 and corn silage mean value as 0 25 us m3 for 2001 2009 and 0 45 us m3 for 2010 2018 was definitely reason for their decrease in planted acreage in the sjws from a microeconomic standpoint it would make more sense to produce and export more high value crops and import more low value crops in order to maximize the ewp as the fifth high ewp crop the mean ewp of processing tomato improved from 0 64 us m3 during 2001 2009 to 1 05 us m3 during 2010 2018 and its increasing planted acreage confirms the market demand california produces 90 of the us total tonnage of processing tomatoes and approximately 50 of the world s production making it an important crop among growers geisseler and horwath 2014 different from the small increase of total wp from 2 11 to 2 15 kg m3 total ewp for these 8 main crops was greatly increased by 111 from 0 55 to 1 16 us m3 which was mainly induced by the changing cropping patterns with more high ewp crops such as nut trees fruit tree and vegetables planted fig 8 shows comparison of the nwp among the 8 major crops between the two periods from 2001 to 2009 and 2010 2018 a total nwp combining all 8 major crops together based on the planting area ratio was also estimated in the figure for five human eaten crops almonds pistachios walnuts grapes processing tomatoes in the sjws nwp for energy mean value as 2000 kcal m3 for period 2001 2009 and 2677 kcal m3 for period 2010 2018 and protein mean value as 87 g m3 for period 2001 2009 and 101 g m3 for period 2010 2018 of processing tomatoes were higher than three nut trees mean value as 488 kcal m3 and 13 g m3 for period 2001 2009 mean value as 568 kcal m3 and 15 g m3 for period 2010 2018 and grapes mean value as 498 kcal m3 and 27 g m3 for period 2001 2009 mean value as 546 kcal m3 and 28 g m3 for period 2010 2018 according to fao balance sheets 2002 a person s daily energy and protein requirement are 2700 kcal day and 75 g daily which indicated that processing tomato could cover one person s daily needs with less than 1 m3 water consumed as one of the most important elements alleviating the malnutrition nwp for calcium for grapes mean value as 412 mg m3 for period 2001 2009 and 429 mg m3 for period 2010 2018 and processing tomatoes mean value as 282 mg m3 for period 2001 2009 and 378 mg m3 for period 2010 2018 had much higher values than nut trees mean value as 58 mg m3 for period 2001 2009 and 67 mg m3 for period 2010 2018 grapes and processing tomato could use about 2 m3 of water to support one person s daily calcium requirement 800 mg m3 while nut trees need to consume more than 8 m3 water to meet the same daily requirement referring to renault and wallender 2000 nut trees have much higher energy protein and calcium content 2482 kcal kg 66 g kg and 377 mg kg than grapes 617 kcal kg 6 g kg and 92 mg kg and processing tomatoes 184 kcal kg 8 g kg and 26 mg kg it is worth noting that a higher energy protein and calcium content per kg but a lower nwp for energy protein and calcium of three nut trees was mainly due to the higher water consumption to produce per kg nut when compared to grapes and processing tomato besides nut trees have higher fat content 215 g kg than processing tomato 1 g kg and grapes 0 g kg and the nwp for fat of nut trees 42 g kg for period 2001 2009 and 49 g kg for period 2010 2018 were slightly higher than grapes 0 g kg and processing tomatoes 11 g kg for period 2001 2009 and 15 g kg for period 2010 2018 processing tomato and grapes as examples of a vegetable and fruit tree their nwp for fat were considered close to 0 dunne 1990 had recommended that an intake of fat providing 25 30 of the energy is compatible with good health and more or less than this range will cause health problems as widely used feed products for livestock especially for beef and dairy cattle alfalfa and corn silage and cottonseed were compared in a group to see their nwp change during these two periods cottonseed is an important commercial product for its oil and can be used in livestock feeds after the oil is extracted the nwp for energy and fat of cottonseed were both much higher than that of alfalfa and corn silage and its nwp for protein and calcium are 0 for it does not contain these two elements nwp for fat of alfalfa and corn silage were similar while corn silage could provide about 2 5 times the nwp for energy 1 5 times the nwp for protein and 17 times the nwp for calcium compared to alfalfa compared with the period 2001 2009 nwp for energy protein fat and calcium during period the 2010 2018 were improved for 7 crops except for alfalfa under the climate variability and changing cropping patterns these changes of nwp between the period 2001 2009 and 2010 2018 were consistent with the variation in yield and wp for the 8 major crops figs s2 and 6 compared to the period 2001 2009 total nwp for energy protein and fat during the period 2010 2018 were reduced from 1211 kcal m3 183 g m3 and 105 g m3 to 1141 kcal m3 111 g m3 and 88 g m3 and total nwp for calcium was increased from 114 to 145 mg m3 decreased nwp for energy protein fat and calcium of alfalfa its relatively higher nwp value than nut trees and its large planting area ratio could be then main reasons for the decrease in total nwp for energy protein and fat despite the decrease in energy and protein the improvement in nwp for calcium and decrease in nwp for fat would benefit the local water and nutrition security future research is needed to understand what types of crops need to be grown to enhance human nutritional security specifically under changing climate and constrained water supplies 3 5 role of wp ewp and nwp evaluations in decision making some of the grand challenges facing humanity in the 21st century include climate change nutritional food security and sustainable use of finite water resources under uncertain climate at a macro level policy maker have to find a balance between increased production of nutritious food to meet the needs of growing populations and sustainable utilization of natural resources to achieve economic goals while at a micro level a grower for example may make decisions targeted towards optimization of net profitability and minimization risk to production for long term sustainability regulations and agricultural incentives need to target increasing ewp in regions where water supplies for agricultural production are severely constrained the premise behind this recommendation is crops with high ewp would increase the economic value of water within a regulated framework that controls over extraction of the finite water resources for irrigation for example in california under sgma groundwater sustainability agencies gsas are required to work with stakeholders within the groundwater basin including growers to achieve groundwater sustainability under this framework farmers can grow high value crops that increase ewp without depleting groundwater resources on the other hand for regions where water supplies are not severely constrained and primarily grow low value crops increasing wp can be promoted as way to achieving overall water resources sustainability rising incomes and urbanization rate have been associated with a nutritional transition that has driven up demand for plant based protein from crops such as almonds walnuts and pistachios to meet nutritional demands at global national levels and local levels policy makers commodity boards and growers need to consider cropping systems that provide the highest amount of nutritional value per unit of water use i e systems that produce the highest nwp developed countries can play a role in helping developing countries achieve not only food security but also nutritional security the benefits of such a partnership would be far ranging from enhanced human health and reduced obesity and elimination of malnutrition for policy makers at regional national or international levels we recommend creating a comprehensive index considering all these three indices i e wp ewp and nwp with different weights for different regional context e g using the analytic hierarchy process method or other comprehensive evaluation methods the analysis employed in this study that comprehensively assesses the benefits of water use in agriculture can be applied to any region with constrained water supplies to determine the optimum use of limited water resources 4 conclusions swat was adopted for assessing the response of et and crop yield to climate variability and changing cropping patterns in the sjws during the period from 1999 to 2018 the model was calibrated and validated for simulating monthly et and crop yield for 8 major crops during the period from 2001 to 2009 and 2010 2018 respectively global sensitivity analysis and calibration were implemented using swat cup temporal variation in monthly swat simulated et and the remotely sensed et for both calibration and validation periods agreed well based on goodness of fit indicators the annual variation in reported yields for the 8 major crops in the sjws were adequately simulated by the swat model in comparison to county level reported yields during the calibration and validation of yield rmspe for the 8 major crops was less than 20 and the absolute values of pbias were less than 6 nse were acceptable and the kge values were above 0 49 future work should consider spatiotemporal variability in management practices that are not typically uniform among farmers e g irrigation scheduling future work should also consider using annual land use maps where possible to capture land use changes on an annual basis our analysis showed a significant increase in regional et in the sjws during the period 2001 2018 which was due to changes in cropping patterns with more water intensive nut trees increasing in area planted increased regional evaporative demand along with the increased temperature and very small decreasing trend in precipitation yield and wp of the 8 major crops all showed increasing trends except for alfalfa which had a decreasing trend ewp of all the 8 major crops increased during the same period indicating a much higher value use for agricultural water compared to the small increase in total wp by only 0 04 kg m3 total ewp increased by 111 from 0 55 to 1 16 us m3 indicating enhanced economic benefits brought to the sjws s by both increasing market price and changing cropping patterns characterized by an expansion in the area under woody perennials including nut trees and vegetables also total nwp for energy protein and fat decreased from 1211 kcal m3 183 g m3 and 105 g m3 to 1141 kcal m3 111 g m3 and 88 g m3 during the period 2010 2018 and total nwp for calcium was increased from 114 to 145 mg m3 compared to processing tomatoes and grapes nut trees provided higher protein and calcium content per kg but had lower nwp for these three elements because of the higher water consumption in producing a kg nut for the three crops primarily used for livestock feeds cottonseed which does not contain calcium had much higher nwp for energy and fat than alfalfa and corn silage the improvement in nwp for calcium and decrease in nwp for fat would definitely benefit the local water and nutrition security to the best of our knowledge this is the first study providing a comparative analysis of different wp ewp and nwp of the major crops in california at a regional scale under changing cropping patterns and climate variability all the three concepts of wp could be used by different stakeholders e g farmers commodity boards irrigation districts groundwater sustainability basins environmental justice groups and policy makers this study also highlights the need to consider various aspects of water use in order to provide comprehensive recommendations for enhancing agricultural water management regional water resources planning food and

10126,climate variability and changing cropping patterns are two main factors directly influencing catchment hydrological processes and agricultural productivity assessing the response of hydrological processes and agricultural production to the combined impacts is of great importance for enhancing water resources management water productivity and agriculture sustainability swat soil and water assessment tools models embedded with 2007 and 2018 land use were built for the san joaquin watershed sjws in california s central valley global sensitivity analysis were conducted to select parameters that have the largest influence on evapotranspiration et processes the model was calibrated and validated produced good agreement for monthly et from remote sensing and yield of 8 major crops using county level reported yields during the periods of 2001 2009 and 2010 2018 based on the outputs of the calibrated sjws swat model regional et showed a significant increase which was caused by rises in temperature and changing cropping patterns associated with increase in area under nut crop production seven major crop yields increased excluding alfalfa implying that the impacts of increasing temperature and small decreases in precipitation were not dominant factors in explaining observed changes in yield from periods 2001 2009 2010 2018 total water productivity wp increased slightly from 2 11 to 2 15 kg m3 associated with more water intensive permanent crop production systems total economic water productivity ewp increased significantly by 111 from 0 55 to 1 16 us m3 which also indicated the substantial economic benefit brought to the sjws by expanding the land area under high ewp crops such as nut crops and vegetables nutritional water productivity nwp for energy protein and fat were reduced from 1211 kcal m3 183 g m3 and 105 g m3 to 1141 kcal m3 111 g m3 and 88 g m3 during the period 2010 2018 mostly due to high water use total nwp for calcium was increased from 114 to 145 mg m3 respectively this study provides initial insights into the response of wp ewp and nwp to the changing cropping patterns and climate variability for major crops in the sjws which could be used by a wide range of stakeholders including farmers commodity boards irrigation districts groundwater sustainability basins environmental justice groups and policy makers to optimize water resources planning and management we recommend creating a comprehensive index that incorporates wp ewp and nwp for making sustainable water resources planning and management decisions keywords evapotranspiration water productivity economic water productivity nutritional water productivity san joaquin swat 1 introduction with more frequent droughts and increasing demand for nutritious food around the world especially in arid and semi arid regions water scarcity is the main constraint to enhancing agricultural productivity improvement in crop water productivity wp has become imperative for sustainability in many cases crop wp is below optimal levels and thus farmers have substantial opportunities to improve brauman et al 2013 wp is defined as the crop production per unit of water consumed with its unit as kg m3 molden 1997 depending on the context and scope of analysis e g farm level decision making by farmers or irrigation managers policy making at regional national or international scale the meaning and concepts of water productivity may vary greatly playán and mateos 2006 the economic water productivity ewp expressed as the gross income in us per unit water consumed is certainly relevant for farmers to pursue higher net benefits on a larger scale national policy makers are usually interested in sustainable management of water resources for various uses to meet present and future needs e g they could encourage through incentives production and exporting of high value crops and importing of low value crops in order to maximize the ewp for examples recently closures of borders and social distancing orders meant to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus covid 19 extended to many countries across the world causing the international food trade to be reduced or suspended based on that the united nations un world food programme wfp estimated that at least 265 million people were at risk of going hungry in 2020 which is almost twice the number in 2019 johnsen et al 2020 considering the quality of life of the human population in the world the nutritional water productivity nwp nutritional value per unit of water use indicates how diet relates to scarce water resources and should also be included in making the agricultural water and dietary policies renault and wallender 2000 evapotranspiration et as a major hydrological component in agricultural systems and the driving factor in forming crop yield and wp is important in agricultural water management assessments thus it is important to identify the major drivers affecting regional spatial temporal variations in et and wp which could help with wp improvement and water resources management it is widely agreed that changing climate and cropping patterns may both alter hydrologic processes and agricultural production in predominantly agricultural watersheds according to the pachauri et al 2014 a rise of about 0 85 0 65 1 06 c global temperature was detected over the period 1880 2012 and higher temperatures are expected to affect all aspects of the hydrological cycle rising temperature and decreasing precipitation will result in decreased river runoff aquifer recharge and inflow and increased crop water demand prowse et al 2006 turral et al 2011 as well as crop yield and water productivity wp niu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 with increasing global population increasing food supply to meet demand cannot be achieved by expanding agricultural land area because of the scarce natural resource and fierce competition for water among agricultural industrial environmental domestic water use and other uses which makes the possibility of expanding irrigated agriculture unlikely carruthers et al 1997 thus farmers commonly reduce the irrigation water use and shift the area of water intensive crops to ones with efficient water use or higher economic value sun et al 2015 human induced cropping pattern changes could affect the hydrological processes such as et surface runoff interception and infiltration zhang et al 2016 vaghefi et al 2015 mahesh 1999 and agricultural production such as crop yield and wp li et al 2009 thus evaluating the impacts of climate variability and cropping patterns change on et and wp variations could help shade light on optimum uses of water resources in agriculture hydrological modelling provides a physical based framework to investigate the relationships between climate variability and land use change on hydrologic processes crop production and water productivity numerous researchers have used hydrologic models in assessing the impacts of changing climate and land use change on hydrological processes all over the world tollan 2002 brath et al 2006 caloiero et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 rani et al 2019 studied fluctuations in potential et under different climate change scenarios in the upper beas basin of the western indian himalaya with the goal of understanding local water availability and demand in the near future wang et al 2017 reported that the crop growth and final yield would decrease in the future due to climate variability bai et al 2017 investigated changes in et under changing cropping patterns and groundwater depth in a large irrigation district of yellow river basin in china and no significant changes in et were detected at from 2000 to 2015 in spite of the substantial changes in cropping patterns li et al 2009 concluded that changing climate had more significant impacts on hydrological processes compared to changing land use in the loess plateau of china vaghefi et al 2015 recommended cropping pattern changes as an effective tool that could be adapted to offset the negative impacts of climate variability on crop production the sjws of california s central valley produces a significant portion of total us agricultural production van lienden et al 2014 zelezny et al 2015 the major crops grown in the watershed include nuts vegetables cotton fruits and field crops the watershed is highly agricultural and a large part of the population of the area is involved in all aspects of agricultural production ficklin et al 2009 recently stress on the water supply system is growing with limited surface water used for irrigation due to worsening droughts many farmers turned to groundwater under constrained water supplies farmers changed cropping patterns to respond to reduced water supplies or market prices hanak et al 2019 for example the southwestern portion of the sjws has long been known for its cotton production with cotton prices dropping in recent years large areas under cotton were shifted to other crops such as almonds walnuts etc also many farmers have planted lower water use crops or increased fallowing to reduce irrigation needs during a particular year studies in sjws were mainly about impacts of climate variability temperature precipitation and co2 on hydrological processes components especially surface runoff ficklin et al 2009 2010 he et al 2012 and the eco environmental system quinn et al 2001 hidalgo et al 2006 ficklin et al 2013 studies on effects of land use change on hydrological processes and eco environment were also conducted by sobota et al 2009 and zhen et al 2010 studies assessing the impacts of climate variability and land use change on water productivity at a regional scale are not available in literature for the sjws there is a great need for quantifying the impacts of changing climate and cropping patterns on evapotranspiration and water productivity for various crops grown in the sjws to support water resources planning and to foster sustainable agricultural water management the soil and water assessment tool swat is a physically based semi distributed eco hydrologic model developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars to predict the impact of agricultural or land management on hydrological hydrochemical and biophysical processes at the watershed scale with heterogeneous soil and land use conditions arnold et al 1998 this model has undergone continued development by the usda ars over 30 years swat s algorithm is integrated in geographic information system gis using an interface called arcswat to support the preparation of input data winchell et al 2008 swat has also been integrated with qgis objectives of this study were to 1 analyze trends in climate variability and changes in cropping patterns in the sjws during the period of 1999 2018 2 perform calibration and validation of the sjws swat model for et and crop yield and 3 assess variations in et yield wp ewp and nwp under climate variability and changing cropping pattern during the period from 2001 to 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 watershed description fig 1 shows the location of the sjws selected for this study we selected this watershed in part because it has experienced both land use change and climate variability over the last 20 years the total area of this watershed is approximately 15 000 km2 which is predominately under agricultural production the majority of the farms are in the merced madera stanislaus san joaquin and fresno counties the land use types in sjws include cropland pasture based livestock farming and forests about 7400 km2 is occupied by pasture and 1100 km2 is occupied by forest chen et al 2017 with about 38 of its total cropland covered by nuts and fruits about 36 covered by field crops such as corn tomato cotton beans etc and less than 10 covered by grain crops california department of water resources dwr 2007 the sjws has a typical mediterranean climate with cool rainy winters and hot dry summers its annual average rainfall ranges from 200 to 300 mm and most of the rainfall occurs from november to april and very little rainfall between may to october national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 2008 the soil type is mostly clay loam to fine sandy loams the san joaquin river originates from the sierra nevada mountains and flows northwest before reaching the sacramento san joaquin delta san joaquin river at vernalis is defined as the watershed outlet which is shown in fig 1 agriculture in the sjws depends highly on irrigation due to its arid climatic conditions a combination of surface water and groundwater is used by local famers to meet their irrigation needs public water distribution projects such as the state water project and the central valley project are used to deliver water to end users with long term water contracts in 2014 california passed the sustainable groundwater management act sgma that created a framework for local and regional management of groundwater with the goal of achieving sustainable groundwater in california by 2042 this act forces farmers to adapt to constrained water supplies when the new regulations are fully implemented 2 2 swat model description a detailed description of swat can be found in nietsch et al 2005 in this section we provide a brief description related to hydrological processes and crop growth based on the topography and stream network swat partitions a watershed into multiple sub watersheds which are then divided into multiple hydrological response units hrus as the basic simulation units for swat hru is defined as a homogeneous spatial unit characterized by a unique combination of homogeneous soil slope and land use types flügel 1995 users could specify the thresholds of land use soil and slope to limit the number of hrus in each sub watershed which could greatly reduce the model running time while maintaining the model simulation accuracy regional hydrological process components such as soil water content et surface runoff percolation groundwater flow etc are calculated independently in each hru on the basis of the water balance method the swat provides several options when simulating hydrologic processes which can be chosen by users based on their data availability in our study we selected the penman monteith method monteith 1965 in swat to calculate et with the requirement of solar radiation relative humidity air temperature and wind speed the plant growth module of swat is a simplified version of the environmental policy integrated calculator epic crop model williams et al 1984 leaf area development biomass accumulation and crop yield are simulated in this module for different crop species 2 3 data input and model setup in this study arcswat version 2012 was applied the main input data for swat are dem describing topography land use map soil map weather data and land and management data which are summarized in table 1 table 2 lists the detailed information of 10 noaa ncdc weather stations in the sjws two swat models were built in this study based on all the same model inputs except for the land use the land use maps of 2007 and 2018 representing the cropping patterns of periods 1999 2009 and 2010 2018 were adopted in these two models respectively although using dynamic land use maps for each year would provide a more accurate representation of the actual land use however a single land use map still could be very useful to represent an entire simulation period ranging from several years to decades especially for those areas with no access to annually dynamic land use map also land use under perennial crops does not change annually due to multiyear life cycle of these crops based on the usda national agricultural statistic service nass statistical results the acreage change in most of the 8 major crops were detected as significant between 1999 and 2018 meanwhile the earliest land use map sourced from the usda nass cropland data layer was in 2007 thus we used land use maps for 2007 and 2018 to investigate cropping pattern changes in this study 2007 and 2018 land use maps both include 16 same land use types which are alfalfa alfa almond almd pistachio pist walnut waln grape grap cotton cotp corn silage csil processing tomato toma agricultural land row crops agrr fallow crop land barr forest frst pasture past wetland wetl shrubland rngb urban urbn and water watr fig 2 in addition to the 8 main crops all the other cropland planted with different crops were reclassified into agrr in this study due to their small area ratio the sjws was divided into 29 sub basins and these sub basins were further subdivided into 920 hrus and 1032 hrus for model with land use of 2007 and 2018 respectively in our study only land use soil and slopes with over 5 coverage of the sub basin were used for hru definition which could eliminate minor slope soil and land use classes with the first two years as warm up period the simulations for swat models with 2007 and 2018 land use maps were performed from 1999 to 2009 and 2008 2018 respectively weather data including daily precipitation the maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and relative humidity for the period of 1999 2018 were obtained from 10 noaa ncdc weather stations located in the sjws these stations were evenly distributed and both cultivated area and forest were considered in selecting weather stations which better captured the spatial distribution of precipitation and eliminated the errors in input precipitation and temperature caused by elevations overall higher elevation will bring higher precipitation and lower temperature epelde et al 2015 for those missing data in these ncds weather datasets gridded 1 km 1 km weather data from nasapower were adopted in this study agricultural management practices for 8 major crops including planting irrigation fertilization and harvesting were determined according to the state level crop progress from the usda nass quick stats 2 0 and recommendations from relevant agricultural specialists nass reports weekly farmer activities and crop growth stages at the state level thus in the swat model agricultural management practices for each crop were uniformly applied for a given crop this may differ from grower to grower actual practices in sjws which introduces a bias in the hydrological and production simulations in addition the swat model was run for agrr and other uncultivated land use types based on default management parameters 2 4 model calibration 2 4 1 remotely sensed et based on pysebal model we used remotely sensed et estimated using pysebal to calibrate the swat based et pysebal unesco ihe 2018 a new version of the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal developed in python environment provides daily et mm d estimates using different satellite imagery sources more details about the algorithms in the pysebal can be obtained from hessels et al 2017 with clear sky conditions 146 path 43 row 34 landsat 7 etm c1 level 1 imageries during 1999 2012 and 74 path 43 row 34 landsat 8 oli tirs c1 level 1 imageries during 2013 2018 were obtained from the usgs eros center http eros usgs gov the images were used to estimate daily et on satellite overpass dates due to the scan line corrector on landsat 7 failing on may 31 of 2003 a gap filling product extension tool in envi was used in this study to provide complete ground coverage for the downloaded landsat 7 etm imageries from 2003 to 2012 as the input data of pysebal daily and hourly gridded weather datasets including precipitation relative humidity air temperature incoming solar radiation and wind speed were collected from nasa power stackhouse et al 2018 and gldas rodell et al 2004 products to estimate the monthly et for the sjws rs based daily et values were linearly interpolated between two adjacent satellite overpasses and time series of daily et values were then reconstructed using the time interpolation module embedded in pysebal for better model adaptability daily pysebal based et values were compared to the 1 km gridded daily modis product mod16a2 usgs lp daac 2020 and the ground based et values from ameriflux law 2005 at the beginning to get the input parameters of pysebal optimized as the summation of daily et values pysebal based monthly et from 2001 to 2018 were finally used for swat based et calibration 2 4 2 county level crop yield statistics county level yield data for the major crops in the sjws were collected for the period of 1999 2018 from the usda nass based on the cropping patterns of the year 2007 and 2018 8 major crops alfalfa almond pistachio walnut grapes cotton corn silage and processing tomato with the highest planting acreage in the sjws were included in this study swat reports crop yields in units of kilograms of dry biomass per hectare and most of the usda nass crop yields reported could be treated as dry weights of biomass thus most of the nass crop yields could be compared directly to the swat crop yields by converting their units accordingly corn silage reported by usda nass tend to have a high moisture content thus its yield predictions from swat was multiplied by a factor of 1 65 for comparison to usda nass corn silage yield lauer 2006 as a fruit crop the yield of processing tomato reported by usda nass is considered as fresh weight while the swat simulated yield of processing tomato is dry weight a conversion factor of dry weight to fresh weight as 13 1 is considered for the comparison of these two yield datasets klemenčič and bulc 2015 2 5 climate variability and trend analysis in order to assess climate variability during the period of 1999 2018 the non parametric mann kendall mk trend test was used in this study to analyze the variation in trend of annual mean temperature and total precipitation from 10 weather stations in the sjws table 1 the mk test statistic was calculated following burn 1994 pohlert 2016 1 z s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 2 s j 1 n 1 i j 1 n sgn x i x j 3 sgn x i x j 1 if x i x j 0 0 if x i x j 0 1 if x i x j 0 4 var s n n 1 2 n 5 t t t 1 2 t 5 18 where x i and x j are two sequential data values and n is the length of the data set the value of s represents the number of positive differences minus the number of negative differences in the analyzed time series under the null hypothesis there is no trend in the data and no correlation between the analyzed variable and time which means each ordering of the data set could be considered equally t is the extent of any given ties and σt refers to the summation of all ties z is the standard normal variate which is used to evaluate the presence of a statistically significant trend a positive z indicates an increasing trend in the time series while a negative z indicates a decreasing trend the null hypothesis is accepted only if the absolute value of z is less than z 1 p 2 which could be obtained from standard normal cumulative distribution tables table s1 lists the z value at significance level of 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 which were applied in this study also another index named kendall slope was also used in mk test in this study and it quantifies the magnitude of the monotonic trend as follows 5 β median x i x j i j where β is the median over all combination of record pairs for the dataset similar to z a positive β also indicates an upward trend and a negative β indicates a downward trend 2 6 model calibration validation and parameter sensitivity analysis et and crop yield are important components for the calculation of crop wp thus calibration and validation of et and crop yield were both conducted in this study sensitivity analysis of parameters involved in et processes were conducted in the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 module embedded in swat cup software abbaspour 2013 global sensitivity analysis based on latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method was adopted in this study to identify the parameters to be calibrated van griensven et al 2006 the impact of each parameter on the model results was quantified and ranked from high to low and parameters to which the model was most sensitive were identified seventeen hydrological parameters were included in the sensitivity analysis for et estimation monthly et data for the period from 2010 to 2018 were used for calibration and data for the period from 2001 to 2009 were used for validation in this study the main variables of interest were et and wp thus only sub basins with more than 70 land use as cultivated area were selected as representative sub basins for et calibration and validation also considering the differences in land use maps for calibration lu map in year of 2018 and validation lu map in year of 2007 monthly et from 16 sub basins and 13 sub basins were finally used for calibration and validation respectively the remotely sensed monthly et are gridded data with 30 m 30 m spatial resolution these et maps were geo referenced and spatially aggregated into each of the 29 sub basins in arcgis only values of remotely sensed monthly et for those selected sub basins were used as the observed et in the spatially distributed calibration and validation processes parameters involved in et process were determined based on the results of sensitivity analysis and some parameters having insignificant impacts on et prediction were ignored the calibration of major crop yields was manually performed after the et calibration was completed by changing 12 parameters which control the development of crop biomass leaf area index crop height and crop yield nair et al 2011 four counties including madera merced fresno and stanislaus were considered in this study and some other counties san joaquin county and mariposa county that have only small ratio of cultivated area in the sjws were excluded swat yield predictions are based on hru while usda nass reports yields at county level this spatial scale difference in observed versus simulated yields creates difficulties in comparing yields directly thus all the swat based simulated yield at hru level were aggregated and up scaled to county level yield in arcgis based on their acreage ratio in each county using the weighted summation method in swat 12 selected parameters were manually adjusted one at time for yield calibration for example the light extinction coefficient ext coef is one of the important parameters for simulating the potential increase in biomass on a given day with a default value of 0 65 however for different crop species ext coef was varied goodness of fit indicators including coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe coefficient nse root mean square error rmse root mean square percentage error rmspe bibby and toutenburg 1977

the proportion of the variance in the measured data that is explained by the model with a range between 0 and 1 with a range from to 1 the nse 1 indicates a perfect match between measurements and simulations and the value between 0 and 1 are usually considered as an acceptable level of model performance negative nse value indicates unacceptable performance when the observed mean is a better indicator than the model simulations the rmse indicates a good match between measurements and simulations when it approaches 0 and higher rmse indicates large errors between model simulations and measurements rmspe comprises three sources of error including errors due to bias deviation of the regression slope from 1 and random error which could allow readers to make a visual comparisons

mean bias which could address existing perceived shortcomings in nse negative kge values similar with negative nse values also imply the poor model performance rogelis et al 2016 and knoben et al 2019 both consider model performance to be good for kge 0 5 sutanudjaja et al 2018 only considered catchments where kge 0 as places where their model was successfully applied moriasi et al 2015 summarized the results of statistical analyses on the pbias for hydrological and water quality model s calibration and validation at different spatial and temporal scales for monthly simulated components at watershed scale acceptable pbias ranges from 38 4 53 1 with its mean value at 7 51 2 7 assessing variability in et crop yield wp ewp and nwp as affected by climate variability and changes in cropping patterns meteorological data of two time periods including 2001 2009 and 2010 2018 and cropping patterns of 2007 and 2018 were adopted in the two calibrated sjws swat models with the same set of calibrated parameters based on the calibrated sjws swat model not only water balance components including surface runoff soil water and evapotranspiration were simulated but also crop yield and wp were also simulated this makes the sjws swat model a valuable tool for exploring how regional et crop yield and wp responds to the climate variability and cropping patterns changes which in turn could provide further insights into the underlying drivers of the local agricultural development for the evaluation of yield wp and ewp of the 8 major crops only the yield of each crop and the prices of the saleable parts for each crop were considered in this study according to nass s annual crop report manual nass 2020 for three nut trees kernel yield hull yield for almond and in shell yield for pistachio and walnut with their corresponding prices were considered for cotton lint yield and seed yield and their prices were considered for corn silage processing tomato and grapes the fresh market yield and the corresponding prices were considered for alfalfa dry biomass weight and its price were considered to comprehensively explain the productivity of water and reach a wider audience for this study the evaluations of wp ewp and nwp during the period of 2001 2018 were described by eqs 12 15 according to fao 2002 energy protein and fat are three main metrics among numerous nutritional components of food which should be considered in evaluating the nwp we also considered calcium in this study because it is a vital element for preventing people from malnutrition renault and wallender 2000 12 wp y et 13 ewp 10 3 gi et 14 gi i 1 n p i y i 15 nwp y et np where wp is the crop water productivity kg m3 and y is the crop harvested yield t ha et is the crop evapotranspiration flux during

parts of a crop and its corresponding market prices us t e g for almond y 1 and y 2 are kernel yield and hull yield respectively and for cotton y 1 and y 2 are lint yield and seed yield respectively nwp is the nutritional water productivity nutrition unit m3 and np is the nutrition content contained in 1 kg of product nutrition unit kg and for detailed information on np including energy protein fat and calcium content per unit of weight for different crops the reader is referred to fao balance sheets 2002 and dunne 1990 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessing changes in cropping patterns table 3 lists all the land use types in the sjws for 2007 and 2018 that were considered in this study the farmland area occupied about 34 and 40 of the entire area in the sjws for 2007 and 2018 respectively three main trends in cropping pattern changes were detected during 2007 2018 increase in the acreage of nut trees fruits and vegetables and the decrease in the acreage of conventional field crops and the increase of fallow cropland almonds pistachios walnuts grapes and processing tomatoes increased by 47 117 74 45 and 12 respectively in 2018 compared to 2007 cotton corn silage and alfalfa decreased by 35 50 and 29 from 2007 to 2018 the change in acreage of various crops in the sjws indicates a shift towards high value crops such as nuts fruits vegetables and other specialty crops and away from conventional low value field crops including corn cotton and wheat johnson and cody 2015 reported that there has been a continued shift toward growing more permanent orchard crops such as fruit nut trees and vineyard in some parts of california central valley although these orchard crops often require long periods before first harvest their relatively higher market prices drive farmers to plant these crops another factor driving changes in cropping patterns is increasing constraints on water supplies causing growers to fallow more land 3 2 climate variability trend analysis table s2 shows the trend statistic for annual average temperature and precipitation during the period 1999 2018 of the ten weather stations four are located in the cultivated area in the middle of the sjws while the other six stations are located in the uncultivated area forests at higher elevations for temperature there was a significant increase for all the ten weather stations from 1999 to 2018 with significance level less than 0 1 the increasing trend in annual mean temperature for five of these ten stations reached a significance level of p 0 01 according to the kendall slopes all the four weather stations located in cultivated area tended to decrease during the period of 1999 2018 while the other six weather stations located in forest did not show a consistent decreasing or increasing trend the changing trend in annual precipitation for all the ten weather stations were not significant for the period of 1999 2018 thus the above results suggest that climate in the sjws was getting warmer cultivated area in the sjws tended to be drier while uncultivated area especially forestry area had higher precipitation annual mean temperature for 2010 2018 increased by 3 c relative to the period from 2001 to 2009 such climate variability would influence hydrological processes such as surface runoff and et an increase of annual temperature would result in an increase of et in the cultivated areas because higher amounts of energy are available to convert liquid water in the soil and plant to water vapor and the rate of et will increase consequently 3 3 sensitivity analysis calibration and validation for et and crop yields the sensitivity analysis results for the et processes are listed in table 4 among the two indicators of parameter sensitivity t stat represents the degree of sensitivity and p value represents the significance of t stat a higher absolute value of t implies a more sensitive parameter and the closer the p value to 0 the less the probability of accidentally assigning a parameter as sensitive in this study 14 parameters with the absolute value of t stat higher than 0 5 were selected as relatively sensitive for the estimation of et in the sjws swat model thus the calibration and validation of et would include these 14 parameters in this study table 5 provides initial range and the calibrated values of the 14 selected parameters involved in the et calibration and validation as mentioned above the monthly et calibration and validation were conducted using sufi 2 in swat cup for the 16 and 13 sub basins in 2010 2018 and 2001 2009 respectively the comparison of monthly simulated et and remotely sensed et with corresponding goodness of fit performance statistics are presented in fig 3 fig s1 provides the temporal variation in monthly swat based et and the remotely sensed et for both calibration and validation periods the range of r 2 nse rmse kge and pbias for the 15 sub basins in the calibration were 0 79 0 91 0 69 0 90 13 23 24 36 0 55 0 92 and 12 78 22 84 respectively only sub basin no 27 showed a relatively low performance of monthly et estimation with these indicators with values of 0 79 0 39 25 68 0 48 and 49 47 which could mostly be attributed to a low cultivated area ratio of 41 for sub basin 27 in 2007 land use map in this study only parameters related to et processes and crop production for 8 major crops were selected for calibration and default swat parameters for land use types except cultivated area were adopted in model setup this could result in discrepancy between simulated swat based et and rs based et on non agricultural land uses for 11 of the 13 sub basins in the validation period these indicators were 0 69 0 90 0 61 0 85 14 22 28 93 0 51 0 76 and 15 36 26 74 respectively the comparison of simulated and remotely sensed monthly et in sub basins no 19 and no 26 showed acceptable agreement with rmse of 28 52 mm and 35 5 mm and pbias valued in 51 54 and 50 89 respectively sub basin no 27 showed better performance during validation period probably due to an increase ratio of its cultivated area compared to calibration period according to the model evaluation performance criteria proposed by moriasi et al 2015 the sjws swat model provided overall good estimations of spatially distributed monthly et for both calibration and validation periods fig s1 also demonstrates that the sjws swat model captures the temporal monthly et dynamics very well the results for crop yield calibration and validation are shown in table 6 the 12 parameters involved in the simulation of crop leaf area index height biomass and yield for the major crops in this study are shown in table 6 the last parameter bmx trees in table 6 pertains to trees only thus it is a very important parameter for yield calibration in an area with lots of fruit and nut trees according to the calibration results most of the default base growth temperature t base of each crop was modified to a lower value and the harvest index hvsti was increased for trees almond pistachio walnut and grape corn silage processing tomato while hvsti for alfalfa and cotton were left at their default values these 12 parameters were modified within a reasonable range 30 for all the other 7 main crops except for processing tomatoes the parameters and algorithms in the epic crop model embedded in swat for toma defaulted to fresh market tomato which finally resulted in a substantial adjustment in the selected parameters in table 6 to make the crop yield calibration satisfactory southern san joaquin valley management practices evaluation program committee 2017 also pointed out several specific refinements in swat using new information among which revisions of several crop growth models including processing tomatoes were required to allow swat model to better reflect the intensive high yielding systems that are common in the california s central valley it is worth noting that the crop models in swat are simplistic and do not simulate detailed crop growth processes such as photosynthesis or respiration but if well calibrated can produce acceptable results particularly under non stress conditions detailed crop modeling with models e g using apsim dssat rzwqm swap designed to simulate detailed processes such as photosynthesis and respiration have a large number of parameters and demand a large amount of data for calibration and validation such amounts of data are not usually available when simulating crop growth processes at a landscape scale motha 2011 kisekka et al 2016 the comparison between the annual simulated and observed crop yields at county level for 8 major crops are shown in fig 4 swat simulated crop yields matched well with the nass reported values although low nse values less than 0 2 were detected for corn silage and processing tomato the goodness of fit statistical performance indicators showed that the rmspe for the 8 major crops in the four counties were less than 20 and the absolute values of pbias were less than 6 the kge values were above 0 49 for all 8 major crops in the four counties the unknown moisture content of corn silage and processing tomato in the nass reports and the previously mentioned simplistic crop growth models in swat could be the primary causes of the relatively poor prediction of corn silage and processing tomatoes and due to the lack of actual historical data on agricultural management practices misrepresenting these model inputs could greatly affect the yield estimations overall the annual yield estimations of the 8 major crops in this study were well simulated in four counties in the sjws 3 4 assessing variations in et crop yield wp ewp and nwp under climate variability and changing cropping patterns as mentioned in section 2 5 only sub basins with more than 70 land use classified as cultivated area were selected as representative agricultural sub basins based on the sjws model outputs annual et for these 13 agricultural based sub basins from 2001 to 2018 is summarized in fig 5 the mann kendall trend test was adopted to assess the temporal trend of annual et which indicated that et had a significantly increasing trend p 0 05 for these 13 sub basins the range in temporal averaged et increased from 379 738 mm for the period 2001 2009 to 505 891 mm for period 2010 2018 the combined effect of changing cropping patterns and climate variability increased regional et by 25 compared to the previous 9 years according to the cropping pattern change results in table 3 an increase increased by 103 in area under fallow and a decrease decreased by 50 in area of the largest single consumer of water alfalfa were detected in the sjws in the latter 9 years 2010 2018 which would have resulted in a decrease in et however an increase in area of water intensive crops such as nut trees including almonds pistachios and walnuts could be the main reason for the increased regional et in the sjws among these cropping patterns changes the planting area under almonds and walnuts were substantially increased by 47 and 74 respectively and that of pistachios even doubled when compared to the period of 2001 2009 a report from the pacific institution noted that almonds along with pistachios are among the top consumers of water they consume about 41 64 million cubic meter of water per year gleick 2015 reisman 2020 grower focused organizations such as the almond board of california have prioritized the need to reduce the amount of water needed to grow a unit of nuts by 20 by the year 2025 almond board of california 2019 as mentioned in section 2 3 agricultural management practices including irrigation fertilization and harvesting for a given crop were applied uniformly in swat thus the spatiotemporal variation in et crop yield and wp were considered to only be caused by climate variability and cropping patterns changes fig s2 shows the temporal variation in crop yields for 8 major crops in the sjws for the period 2001 2018 compared to the period of 2001 2009 the average yield of almonds kernel hull pistachio in shell walnut in shell grapes fresh cotton lint seed corn silage fresh and processing tomato fresh in the sjws for period of 2010 2018 were increased from 6 39 2 91 4 61 24 92 4 51 64 13 and 92 71 t ha to 7 89 3 23 4 45 25 67 5 63 64 51 128 98 t ha the mann kendall trend test results showed that yields of all these 7 major crops had an increasing trend except for alfalfa under impacts of the significantly rising temperature and insignificant changes in precipitation in general increasing temperature tend to result in higher crop water consumption thus result in a higher crop yield if water is non limiting trends in yields varied greatly from significant to not significant which may be attributed to the differences in crop growth responses to the impacts of temperature on yield formation processes previous studies have shown that rising temperatures may have a positive or negative effect on alfalfa yield depending on the real time climatic conditions at a given location the species specific temperature range suitable for growth and photosynthesis and soil resources hatfield et al 2011 lee et al 2013 thivierge et al 2016 from period 2001 2009 to 2010 2018 reductions in alfalfa yields from 18 70 to 18 02 t ha under increasing temperature and relatively small decreases in precipitation could be supported by the conclusions of previous studies on alfalfa yield reduction under warmer and drier environments fig 6 shows the temporal variation in wp for each major crop and the total wp summarizing the wp of 8 major crops based on their planting area ratio during the period of 2001 2018 in the sjws the mann kendall trend test results indicated that seven crops excluding alfalfa all had a significant increasing trend in wp while alfalfa had a significant decreasing trend in wp p 0 01 the comprehensive total wp of 8 major crops in the sjws show an insignificantly increasing trend this may due to the change of cropping patterns including the greatly increased planting area of nut trees while their wp were relatively small compared to other crops compared to the period 2001 2009 the average wp during the period 2010 2018 for almonds kernel hull pistachios in shell walnuts in shell grapes fresh cotton lint seed corn silage fresh and processing tomatoes fresh increased from 0 69 0 28 0 48 4 48 0 52 9 32 10 87 and 0 23 0 83 0 35 0 45 4 67 0 62 9 82 14 55 and 0 28 kg m3 respectively wp for alfalfa decreased by 8 from 2 16 to 1 98 kg m3 as an index reflecting the combined positive and negative impacts of climate variability and changing cropping patterns total wp for 8 major crops was only slightly increased from 2 11 to 2 15 on one hand increasing temperatures in the agricultural areas of the sjws will increase the crop water use and yield which could improve the wp for each crop due to the highly positive correlation between crop yield and wp on the other hand substantial increase in the acreage of water intensive nut trees with low wp values will eventually reduce the regional total productivity per unit of water consumed fig s3 shows the correlations between crop wp and yield for 8 major crops in the sjws which also shows the strong relevance between crop yield and wp the value of r 2 for almonds pistachios walnuts cotton and processing tomatoes were all above 0 9 which means that crop yield is the dominate factor in determining wp besides the wp of each crop farmers would also take into consideration the ewp as a key factor determining which crops to grow ewp is an index considering production crop water use cropping patterns and crop prices thus the crop price fluctuations from year to year were included in ewp for each crop in this study we did not separate the impact of crop price fluctuations from climate variability and cropping patterns changes in this study fig 7 shows the temporal variation in ewp during the period 2001 2018 for the 8 major crops and a comprehensive indicator named total ewp representing ewp for all these 8 major crops based on their acreage ratio the top five crops with relatively high ewp are pistachios almonds grapes walnuts and processing tomatoes their planted area were increased substantially from the period 2001 2009 to period 2010 2018 cotton corn silage and alfalfa had relatively low ewp in the sjws overall the ewp for all the 8 major crops was improved greatly from the former 9 years to the latter 9 years due to the increasing market prices nass 2020 despite their low wp nut trees including almonds pistachios and walnuts produced substantially higher economic return per cubic of water use which made them more popular crop choices among farmers in the sjws during this period fig 7 the average ewp for almonds pistachios and walnuts were increased from 0 83 0 92 and 0 72 during the period 2001 2009 to 1 44 1 64 and 1 13 us m3 during the period 2010 2018 as a less water intensive crop compared to nut trees grapes also produced higher ewp which increased from 0 94 us m3 during the period 2001 2018 1 70 us m3 alfalfa as the most water intensive crop among the 8 major crops had a relatively low average ewp of 0 29 us m3 for the period from 2001 to 2009 and 0 4 us m3 for the period of 2010 2018 thus under the warmer and drier climate and expensive scare water resources during the period 2001 2018 it was reasonable that more farmers shifted from growing field crops to high value nuts and grapes low ewp of cotton mean value as 0 34 us m3 for 2001 2009 and 0 57 us m3 for 2010 2018 and corn silage mean value as 0 25 us m3 for 2001 2009 and 0 45 us m3 for 2010 2018 was definitely reason for their decrease in planted acreage in the sjws from a microeconomic standpoint it would make more sense to produce and export more high value crops and import more low value crops in order to maximize the ewp as the fifth high ewp crop the mean ewp of processing tomato improved from 0 64 us m3 during 2001 2009 to 1 05 us m3 during 2010 2018 and its increasing planted acreage confirms the market demand california produces 90 of the us total tonnage of processing tomatoes and approximately 50 of the world s production making it an important crop among growers geisseler and horwath 2014 different from the small increase of total wp from 2 11 to 2 15 kg m3 total ewp for these 8 main crops was greatly increased by 111 from 0 55 to 1 16 us m3 which was mainly induced by the changing cropping patterns with more high ewp crops such as nut trees fruit tree and vegetables planted fig 8 shows comparison of the nwp among the 8 major crops between the two periods from 2001 to 2009 and 2010 2018 a total nwp combining all 8 major crops together based on the planting area ratio was also estimated in the figure for five human eaten crops almonds pistachios walnuts grapes processing tomatoes in the sjws nwp for energy mean value as 2000 kcal m3 for period 2001 2009 and 2677 kcal m3 for period 2010 2018 and protein mean value as 87 g m3 for period 2001 2009 and 101 g m3 for period 2010 2018 of processing tomatoes were higher than three nut trees mean value as 488 kcal m3 and 13 g m3 for period 2001 2009 mean value as 568 kcal m3 and 15 g m3 for period 2010 2018 and grapes mean value as 498 kcal m3 and 27 g m3 for period 2001 2009 mean value as 546 kcal m3 and 28 g m3 for period 2010 2018 according to fao balance sheets 2002 a person s daily energy and protein requirement are 2700 kcal day and 75 g daily which indicated that processing tomato could cover one person s daily needs with less than 1 m3 water consumed as one of the most important elements alleviating the malnutrition nwp for calcium for grapes mean value as 412 mg m3 for period 2001 2009 and 429 mg m3 for period 2010 2018 and processing tomatoes mean value as 282 mg m3 for period 2001 2009 and 378 mg m3 for period 2010 2018 had much higher values than nut trees mean value as 58 mg m3 for period 2001 2009 and 67 mg m3 for period 2010 2018 grapes and processing tomato could use about 2 m3 of water to support one person s daily calcium requirement 800 mg m3 while nut trees need to consume more than 8 m3 water to meet the same daily requirement referring to renault and wallender 2000 nut trees have much higher energy protein and calcium content 2482 kcal kg 66 g kg and 377 mg kg than grapes 617 kcal kg 6 g kg and 92 mg kg and processing tomatoes 184 kcal kg 8 g kg and 26 mg kg it is worth noting that a higher energy protein and calcium content per kg but a lower nwp for energy protein and calcium of three nut trees was mainly due to the higher water consumption to produce per kg nut when compared to grapes and processing tomato besides nut trees have higher fat content 215 g kg than processing tomato 1 g kg and grapes 0 g kg and the nwp for fat of nut trees 42 g kg for period 2001 2009 and 49 g kg for period 2010 2018 were slightly higher than grapes 0 g kg and processing tomatoes 11 g kg for period 2001 2009 and 15 g kg for period 2010 2018 processing tomato and grapes as examples of a vegetable and fruit tree their nwp for fat were considered close to 0 dunne 1990 had recommended that an intake of fat providing 25 30 of the energy is compatible with good health and more or less than this range will cause health problems as widely used feed products for livestock especially for beef and dairy cattle alfalfa and corn silage and cottonseed were compared in a group to see their nwp change during these two periods cottonseed is an important commercial product for its oil and can be used in livestock feeds after the oil is extracted the nwp for energy and fat of cottonseed were both much higher than that of alfalfa and corn silage and its nwp for protein and calcium are 0 for it does not contain these two elements nwp for fat of alfalfa and corn silage were similar while corn silage could provide about 2 5 times the nwp for energy 1 5 times the nwp for protein and 17 times the nwp for calcium compared to alfalfa compared with the period 2001 2009 nwp for energy protein fat and calcium during period the 2010 2018 were improved for 7 crops except for alfalfa under the climate variability and changing cropping patterns these changes of nwp between the period 2001 2009 and 2010 2018 were consistent with the variation in yield and wp for the 8 major crops figs s2 and 6 compared to the period 2001 2009 total nwp for energy protein and fat during the period 2010 2018 were reduced from 1211 kcal m3 183 g m3 and 105 g m3 to 1141 kcal m3 111 g m3 and 88 g m3 and total nwp for calcium was increased from 114 to 145 mg m3 decreased nwp for energy protein fat and calcium of alfalfa its relatively higher nwp value than nut trees and its large planting area ratio could be then main reasons for the decrease in total nwp for energy protein and fat despite the decrease in energy and protein the improvement in nwp for calcium and decrease in nwp for fat would benefit the local water and nutrition security future research is needed to understand what types of crops need to be grown to enhance human nutritional security specifically under changing climate and constrained water supplies 3 5 role of wp ewp and nwp evaluations in decision making some of the grand challenges facing humanity in the 21st century include climate change nutritional food security and sustainable use of finite water resources under uncertain climate at a macro level policy maker have to find a balance between increased production of nutritious food to meet the needs of growing populations and sustainable utilization of natural resources to achieve economic goals while at a micro level a grower for example may make decisions targeted towards optimization of net profitability and minimization risk to production for long term sustainability regulations and agricultural incentives need to target increasing ewp in regions where water supplies for agricultural production are severely constrained the premise behind this recommendation is crops with high ewp would increase the economic value of water within a regulated framework that controls over extraction of the finite water resources for irrigation for example in california under sgma groundwater sustainability agencies gsas are required to work with stakeholders within the groundwater basin including growers to achieve groundwater sustainability under this framework farmers can grow high value crops that increase ewp without depleting groundwater resources on the other hand for regions where water supplies are not severely constrained and primarily grow low value crops increasing wp can be promoted as way to achieving overall water resources sustainability rising incomes and urbanization rate have been associated with a nutritional transition that has driven up demand for plant based protein from crops such as almonds walnuts and pistachios to meet nutritional demands at global national levels and local levels policy makers commodity boards and growers need to consider cropping systems that provide the highest amount of nutritional value per unit of water use i e systems that produce the highest nwp developed countries can play a role in helping developing countries achieve not only food security but also nutritional security the benefits of such a partnership would be far ranging from enhanced human health and reduced obesity and elimination of malnutrition for policy makers at regional national or international levels we recommend creating a comprehensive index considering all these three indices i e wp ewp and nwp with different weights for different regional context e g using the analytic hierarchy process method or other comprehensive evaluation methods the analysis employed in this study that comprehensively assesses the benefits of water use in agriculture can be applied to any region with constrained water supplies to determine the optimum use of limited water resources 4 conclusions swat was adopted for assessing the response of et and crop yield to climate variability and changing cropping patterns in the sjws during the period from 1999 to 2018 the model was calibrated and validated for simulating monthly et and crop yield for 8 major crops during the period from 2001 to 2009 and 2010 2018 respectively global sensitivity analysis and calibration were implemented using swat cup temporal variation in monthly swat simulated et and the remotely sensed et for both calibration and validation periods agreed well based on goodness of fit indicators the annual variation in reported yields for the 8 major crops in the sjws were adequately simulated by the swat model in comparison to county level reported yields during the calibration and validation of yield rmspe for the 8 major crops was less than 20 and the absolute values of pbias were less than 6 nse were acceptable and the kge values were above 0 49 future work should consider spatiotemporal variability in management practices that are not typically uniform among farmers e g irrigation scheduling future work should also consider using annual land use maps where possible to capture land use changes on an annual basis our analysis showed a significant increase in regional et in the sjws during the period 2001 2018 which was due to changes in cropping patterns with more water intensive nut trees increasing in area planted increased regional evaporative demand along with the increased temperature and very small decreasing trend in precipitation yield and wp of the 8 major crops all showed increasing trends except for alfalfa which had a decreasing trend ewp of all the 8 major crops increased during the same period indicating a much higher value use for agricultural water compared to the small increase in total wp by only 0 04 kg m3 total ewp increased by 111 from 0 55 to 1 16 us m3 indicating enhanced economic benefits brought to the sjws s by both increasing market price and changing cropping patterns characterized by an expansion in the area under woody perennials including nut trees and vegetables also total nwp for energy protein and fat decreased from 1211 kcal m3 183 g m3 and 105 g m3 to 1141 kcal m3 111 g m3 and 88 g m3 during the period 2010 2018 and total nwp for calcium was increased from 114 to 145 mg m3 compared to processing tomatoes and grapes nut trees provided higher protein and calcium content per kg but had lower nwp for these three elements because of the higher water consumption in producing a kg nut for the three crops primarily used for livestock feeds cottonseed which does not contain calcium had much higher nwp for energy and fat than alfalfa and corn silage the improvement in nwp for calcium and decrease in nwp for fat would definitely benefit the local water and nutrition security to the best of our knowledge this is the first study providing a comparative analysis of different wp ewp and nwp of the major crops in california at a regional scale under changing cropping patterns and climate variability all the three concepts of wp could be used by different stakeholders e g farmers commodity boards irrigation districts groundwater sustainability basins environmental justice groups and policy makers this study also highlights the need to consider various aspects of water use in order to provide comprehensive recommendations for enhancing agricultural water management regional water resources planning food and

10127,irrigated agriculture is a major consumer of freshwater and acreage of irrigated land has increased as producers have become increasingly reliant on irrigation to ensure adequate yields and reduce production risks information about the soil s field capacity or the water content after a saturated soil has drained for at least 24 h is needed to determine the soil s readily available water or the amount of water that can be safely removed by plants to address the challenges associated with using soil water sensors in highly variable soils soil water measurements were included in ongoing cotton irrigation studies during the 2017 through 2019 growing seasons at the university of missouri fisher delta research center near portageville sensor based field capacity values were compared among multiple commercially available sensors time domain reflectometry sensors acclima tdr 315 were installed at four depths and five locations each of the three years in addition resistance type sensors irrometer watermark 200ss were installed at five depths and five locations for two years the goal was to provide guidance on how best to use soil moisture sensor data for irrigation management although water continued to move in the profile for more than 24 h after saturation the average change between 24 and 48 h at each observed depth was 0 015 m3 m 3 observed values for coarser textured soils were much wetter after 24 h than expected based on published field capacity values and in one case even a small difference in sensor location had a large effect on the observed field capacity furthermore soil apparent electrical conductivity was highly correlated to measured field capacity which could result in a much faster and less expensive way to estimate field capacity compared to collecting and analyzing soil cores these findings demonstrate that the application of soil moisture sensors for irrigation management is site specific and differences can be observed over short distances within a field the research is continuing to better meet the needs of agricultural producers consultants research and extension personnel and others for information to improve irrigation management keywords soil moisture sensor soil water content irrigation scheduling water management 1 introduction irrigated agriculture in the usa is a major consumer of freshwater and accounts for approximately 80 of the nation s consumptive water use schaible and aillery 2015 irrigation is required for crop production in arid and semiarid regions however acreage of irrigated land has increased in more humid portions of the usa the usa mid south region including the lower mississippi river valley is one of the major crop production regions in the united states and producers there have become increasingly reliant on irrigation to ensure adequate yields and reduce production risks vories and evett 2014 typical precipitation exceeds 1000 mm annually in this area but generally 20 occurs during june to august when crops require large quantities of water precipitation patterns frequently include heavy rainfall events that cause runoff with only a small amount of the rainfall becoming available for plant use while a producer can control the application rate to minimize runoff from sprinkler irrigation knowing how much of a rainfall or a surface irrigation was effective in reaching the root zone is challenging irrigation scheduling methods include weather based soil moisture based and plant based methods weather based methods schedule irrigation based on the estimated amount of water lost by plant evapotranspiration et and the amount of effective rainfall and irrigation water entering the plant root zone soil based methods measure soil water content or matric potential levels in the plant root zone and irrigation is applied when there is a shortage of available water for plants plant based methods directly detect plant responses to water stress and irrigation is initialized as plants indicate water stress stetson and mecham 2011 soil water content can be directly determined using the manual gravimetric method asabe standards 2019 collecting weighing and drying soil samples however the method is time consuming and expensive similarly the neutron probe is reliable and accurate for measuring soil water content chanasyk and naeth 1996 but its application has been limited by the cost and special requirements associated with handling the radioactive source electromagnetic em sensors such as electrical capacitance and resistance type sensors and time domain reflectometry tdr devices have been developed and widely adopted for soil moisture measurement in irrigation scheduling evett and parkin 2005 miranda et al 2005 o shaughnessy and sui 2018 sui 2018 sui and vories 2020 sui and baggard 2015 in general previous research indicated that the em sensors were inexpensive easy to install and maintain and able to provide useful information for irrigation scheduling feng and sui 2020 investigated sensor calibration in undisturbed soil for multiple sensors and observed improved performance above factory calibration with in situ calibration however datta et al 2018 showed strong agreement between the factory calibration and a local calibration for the acclima tdr 315 tdr sensors acclima meridian id usa in a low salinity low clay soil similarly evett et al 2019 reported reasonable accuracy for the acclima tdr 315l tdr sensors an update to the 315 with a lower energy requirement across a range of soil textures from fine sandy loam to clay to determine the operating parameters for weather based or sensor based irrigation schedulers some idea of the soil water retention curve or the relationship between water content and matric potential is needed to determine the amount of water that can be removed from the soil before needing replacement in general the total available water is considered to be the portion between field capacity fc and permanent wilting point wp fc is the soil water content after a thoroughly wetted soil has drained for some period typically 24 h evett et al 2019 a laboratory determined value of the water content of a soil core after a pressure of 33 kpa has been applied to a saturated soil is often considered the fc however a simple definition of fc is not always possible because water retention in a soil profile depends on the transmission properties of the entire profile rather than at a particular point baver et al 1972 large errors in water retention estimates may occur from the association of field capacity with a particular water potential hansen et al 1979 and some researchers refer to the field drained value as a well drained upper limit to avoid confusion with the laboratory value similarly a laboratory determined value of the water content of a soil core after a pressure of 1 5 mpa has been applied to a saturated soil is generally considered the wp while the wp value is also not a constant the fact that water content does not change very much at high tensions makes the exact wp value much less important than fc laboratory determined fc and wp values based on soil texture are widely available in the literature e g hansen et al 1979 ratliff et al 1983 while some published values are from single sites rawls et al 1982 reported values based on 1323 soils from 32 usa states however even within a texture class there is a wide range of observed values and rawls et al 1982 reported an average value for sand of 0 091 m3 m 3 with a standard deviation of 0 073 m3 m 3 furthermore how the texture class is determined for a specific sensor location can be a challenge soil cores can be collected near the sensors and tested but few row crop producers would go to that trouble and expense for one season even when soil cores were used sui and vories 2020 observed that in a highly variable soil the sensor readings did not always agree with the core analyses the u s department of agriculture s natural resources conservation service nrcs has published county soil surveys for most usa counties often the only spatial soil texture data available to farmers is the county soil survey but the precision is not adequate for many site specific applications electrical conductivity measurement of bulk soil referred to as apparent electrical conductivity eca integrates conductance through the soil solution through contact of solid soil particles and via exchangeable cations that exist at the solid liquid interface of clay minerals corwin and lesch 2003 mobile measurements of soil eca have become widely used to map soil variability because eca responds to several important soil properties and mobile measurements are relatively quick and inexpensive in non saline soils most of the variation in eca is a function of soil texture moisture content bulk density and cation exchange capacity cec corwin and lesch 2005 samples collected from the field and analyzed for texture can be used to relate texture and eca in a field eca data have been used to estimate the depth of flood induced sand deposition kitchen et al 1996 the topsoil depth above a subsoil claypan horizon doolittle et al 1994 or soil texture over a complete profile or for specific layers sudduth et al 2005 vories et al 2020 in some regions fields contain very sandy areas that are too small to appear on most soil surveys freeland et al 2008 such areas can be important to irrigation management due to the low plant available water associated with sand although the sandy areas will appear as relatively low eca many agricultural soils have high sand content and the especially sandy areas might be difficult to differentiate from the surrounding soil in addition because the eca response with depth is non linear dualem 2014 the eca associated with sand at one depth in the profile is not the same as for sand at a different depth vories et al 2020 were only able to achieve r2 0 658 between sand in the top 533 mm and eca for 0 5 m depth of exploration doe the depth at which 70 of the cumulative response is obtained in a highly variable soil with the challenges associated with using soil water sensors in highly variable soils there are always questions regarding understanding and interpreting the data therefore the objective of this study was to compare sensor based fc values among multiple commercial sensors based on factory calibration over three years and investigate trends to provide guidance on how best to use the sensor data to aid in irrigation scheduling 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site soil water content measurements were included in ongoing cotton irrigation studies during the 2017 through 2019 growing seasons similarly soil matric potential measurements were included during the 2017 and 2018 seasons the study field located at the university of missouri fisher delta research center near portageville 36 41 n 89 70 w is approximately 10 ha i e 320 m by 320 m with the primary slope 2 mm m 1 in the south to north direction and a cross slope 1 mm m 1 in the west to east direction daily and hourly weather data were collected approximately 600 m from the most distant part of the study site and placed on the university of missouri agricultural electronic bulletin board agebb http agebb missouri edu the study was in the east half of the field in 2017 and 2019 and the west half in 2018 the field is located roughly 14 km west of the mississippi river and lies within the new madrid seismic zone the combination of alluvial eolian and seismic activity over the years has resulted in highly variable soils in the region 2 2 soils soil map units within the study field included dundee silt loam de fine silty mixed active thermic typic endoaqualfs reelfoot loam re and sandy loam overwash rf fine silty mixed superactive thermic aquic argiudolls steele sandy loam st sandy over clayey mixed superactive nonacid thermic aquic udifluvents and tiptonville silt loam tp fine silty mixed superactive thermic oxyaquic argiudolls with tp comprising the majority of the field usda scs 1971 fig 1 however the field contains areas of high sand content that are often too small to show up in the soils map and the county soil survey reported that sandy loam overwash makes up about 20 of the tiptonville area usda scs 1971 to provide higher resolution soil information mobile eca data were collected on 13 june 2019 east half and 17 june 2019 west half the dualem 1hs system dualem milton on canada used has dual geometry receivers at separations of 1 and ½ m from the transmitter to provide simultaneous 0 3 0 5 0 8 and 1 6 m does dualem 2014 data were collected on a 1 s interval at a 2 1 m s 1 overland speed and a 3 9 m transect spacing location of each data point was determined with a global navigation satellite system gnss using an ag leader gps 7500 receiver ag leader technology ames ia usa with terrastar c pro differential correction with pass to pass accuracy of 30 60 mm ag leader technology 2019 in addition soil texture data sand silt and clay fractions from laboratory analysis were obtained from multiple locations within the study field the sampling locations were selected for their proximity to soil moisture sensors placed in the field in 2017 additional cores were obtained near two of the 2018 locations fig 1 the soil cores were 51 mm in diameter and generally 838 mm in length and were divided into five to seven sections with the uppermost section comprising the layer from the surface to 76 mm and each of the lower sections in 152 mm increments 2 3 sensors before planting the field was bedded using disc hippers in the north south direction with a row spacing of 0 97 m the fields were planted in may and two types of soil sensors were installed in early to mid july and remained in the field until early october a total of sixteen acclima tdr 315 and four acclima tdr 315l tdr sensors included in the ongoing cotton study were placed at depths of 152 305 457 and 610 mm below the soil surface on 12 july 2017 16 july 2018 and 3 july 2019 fig 1 the 315l was an update of the 315 with lower power requirements additional information regarding the acclima sensors was provided by schwartz et al 2016 and wilson et al 2020 the first portion of the sensor label in fig 1 represents the irrigation plot of the ongoing study with the final two digits denoting the year the sensor was installed in that location e g p15 18 represents the sensors in plot p15 in 2018 the surface of the soil bed was approximately 10 cm above the bottom of the furrow when the sensors were installed a hole was dug in the furrow beside the bed and the sensors were inserted horizontally into the undisturbed bed at the desired depths a probe guide was used to ensure that the waveguide rods remained parallel when the probe was pushed into the soil the four sensors at each location were connected to a cr206x datalogger campbell scientific logan ut usa and read at hourly 2017 or 15 minute 2018 2019 intervals with the data wirelessly transmitted to a central computer equipped with a campbell scientific rf401a spread spectrum radio the sensors were removed shortly before harvest each year on 2 october 2017 11 october 2018 and 10 october 2019 watermark 200ss sensors irrometer co riverside calif usa were installed at five depths 152 305 457 610 and 762 mm below the soil surface within approximately 1 m of the tdr sensors fig 1 in 2017 and 2018 the watermark sensor which estimates tension based on resistance was selected because it is a relatively inexpensive sensor that is widely used e g vellidis research group undated henry et al 2020 rix et al 2020 the five sensors were constructed in a single probe by advanced ag systems dothan al usa to minimize the soil disturbance that would have been caused by five individual sensors while many users recommend pouring a soil slurry into the hole before placing the sensors irmak et al 2016 reported that the slurry could introduce additional measurement problems therefore no slurry was used the sensors were inserted in the plant row from the top of the soil bed which minimized the chance of water ponding near the sensor the five sensors at each location were connected to a 900 m watermark monitor and the data were recorded at 30 minute intervals no soil temperature sensor was used and no temperature adjustments were made the recorded soil moisture tension values based on the internal calibration in the 900 m monitor were manually downloaded 2 4 data management the large spatially referenced data sets were managed with arcgis for desktop 10 4 1 esri redlands ca usa to construct a data set containing the eca data nearest a soil sensor location the aggregating procedure described by griffin et al 2007 and vories et al 2015 was followed with all eca data points within 2 2 m of a sensor location averaged the 2 2 m radius was selected to ensure that each location had at least one associated eca value sas for windows 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa was used for statistical analyses and tests of significance were conducted at the alpha 5 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall fig 2 shows the cumulative rainfall observed after sensor installation each year for the months of august and september while rain events large enough to saturate the soil profile often do not occur during the growing season during the time the sensors were logging in each of the three years there were extended wet periods table 1 contains the saturation rainfall dates for all three years in 2017 and 2018 the adjacent watermark sensors confirmed that the profile was saturated as seen for plot p11 in 2017 fig 3 as is often the case in hydrologic studies it was difficult to delineate the rainfall events in this case the beginning was defined as a measurable hourly rainfall i e 0 25 mm after at least one day with no rainfall recorded similarly the end was defined as the last measurable hourly rainfall before at least one day with no rainfall the sensor based fc was the value 24 h after the end of the rainfall period while evett et al 2019 stated that 24 h is a typical drain time and colman 1947 reported that soil moisture remained substantially constant after the first day some researchers recommend a longer period sui and vories 2020 used 48 h to determine a sensor based fc however the sensor reading difference between 24 h and 48 h was generally less than 0 01 m3 m 3 r sui personal communication 9 september 2020 in this study rainfall was observed before 48 h in 2018 however in 2017 and 2019 it was possible to compare the sensor based values at 24 h and 48 h after the rainfall event the average value at 48 h was 0 0084 m3 m 3 less than the 24 h value and since there was a crop in the field evapotranspiration would account for some of the difference although the effect of year was not significant sensor depth was significant table 2 indicating that water was still moving in the profile after 24 h however the average change at any depth was 0 015 m3 m 3 3 2 watermark sensors initially it was hoped that a site specific relationship between soil matric potential and volumetric water content could be developed by locating the tdrs and watermark sensors adjacent to each other even though the watermark sensors only measure tension 239 kpa as seen in fig 3 that is the range most important to crop production many sources e g irmak et al 2016 present general relationships however the specific relationships determined in different locations in a highly variable field would be useful in interpreting the data for irrigation management one of the best examples of the observed data in this study was for the 152 mm sensors in plot p11 in 2017 fig 4 the same plot included in fig 3 the effects of hysteresis observed in the data together with the frequent rainfalls and irrigations and the narrow range of tension observed in some of the deeper sensors led to weak relationships in almost all cases in addition data losses were common often due to wildlife damage while watermark sensors are often recommended for irrigation scheduling e g vellidis research group undated henry et al 2020 rix et al 2020 this study did not provide sufficient information on which to base any guidelines for their use therefore the watermark data were primarily used qualitatively to indicate whether the soil around a sensor was saturated no watermark sensors were installed in 2019 3 3 county soil survey even though soil eca surveys have become common most only indicate variability and are not calibrated to indicate actual soil texture standard grower practice in many areas is to use the county soil survey map units rather than extensive soil sampling and testing it can be seen in fig 1 that based on the pemiscot county missouri soil survey usda scs 1971 13 of the sensor sites 52 sensors were located within the tiptonville silt loam map unit tp while 2 sites 8 sensors were located within the steele sandy loam map unit st table 3 contains the fc averages based on map unit with only two sites in st little can be concluded however the high coefficients of variation cv show that there was much variability between the two sites the averages for the 13 sites in tp all fell within the 1 standard deviation sd values reported by rawls et al 1982 for laboratory values for silt loam there was quite a lot of variability which is not surprising considering that sandy loam overwash was reported to make up about 20 of the tp area usda scs 1971 for site specific irrigation more precise soil information and fc values are needed 3 4 soil cores by design all ten of the sensor sites in 2017 and 2019 were located very near soil sampling sites fig 1 fewer samples were collected from the west half of the field and only two of the sites in 2018 were near soil sampling sites although three samples were damaged and one of the sensors malfunctioned for a short time there were 44 combinations of measured texture for the cores and the observed sensor based fc for the adjacent sensors table 4 the coarser textures especially sand and loamy sand had the largest differences with the values published by rawls et al 1982 with much higher moisture content at fc than the texture suggested this is not surprising because all of rawls values were for water retained at a pressure of 33 kpa while hansen et al 1979 reported that fc for sandy soils tended to be nearer 10 kpa baver et al 1972 presented graphs of 16 soils based on five pressures from 10 kpa to 1 5 mpa that demonstrated the large differences in moisture content between 10 and 33 kpa hansen et al 1979 who discussed the tendency for fc at lower tension for coarser textured soils presented an average fc value for sandy texture of 0 15 m3 m 3 which is higher than the rawls et al 1982 value for sand 0 09 m3 m 3 but lower than the average for the sand measurements in this study 0 20 m3 m 3 ratliff et al 1983 reported a field determined average fc for 76 samples of sand as 0 11 m3 m 3 which was also much lower than the average in this study averages from the 9 sand and 12 loamy sand samples in this study were both 1 sd higher than the averages for 762 sand and 338 loamy sand samples reported by rawls et al 1982 table 4 values for the other textures were within 1 sd of the rawls et al 1982 value the higher values can occur when there is clay in the deeper layers causing perched water however clay contents were low in this field in all but two cases at least one deeper sample was collected below the sensor depth two of the sites had 90 sand content and were not stable enough to collect a deeper sample of all the samples tested the highest observed clay content was 34 and most were 20 it is unlikely that there was perched water in this study therefore the observed differences were probably due to fc for these sandy soils being nearer to 10 than 33 kpa as hansen et al 1979 and others reported in practice the higher than expected fc values could have a negative impact on irrigated crops if weather based irrigation scheduling calculated available water based on the lower fc value there would be more water than expected remaining in the soil when water was added and waterlogging could occur conversely if irrigation thresholds for sensor based scheduling were based on the lower fc value more of the total available water i e fc wp would be used before irrigation was recommended which could result in some degree of water deficit stress sensors were placed in two of the same plots in 2019 as 2017 fig 1 p8 and p15 which presented the opportunity to compare the sensor based fc between years table 5 the same sensors were used in the same plot and at the same depth in both years it is seldom possible to return to the exact same site and the two sensor locations in p8 were approximately 1 5 m apart while the sites in p15 were approximately 2 5 m apart in plot p8 the fc values were lower in 2017 even though the watermark sensor indicated that soil at all depths to 762 mm was saturated however the relationship among the sensors suggested the soil profiles were different fig 5 in 2017 three of the sensors appeared to be in a coarser soil texture while the fourth 457 mm appeared to be in a finer textured soil fig 5a however in 2019 the two shallower sensors appeared to be in a coarser soil texture and the two deeper appeared to be in a finer textured soil fig 5b even though the locations were not far apart the complex soil layering in the field affected the observed fc values which suggests that new texture samples would be needed each year the sensor responses were more similar in p15 even though the sensor locations were further apart with regard to irrigation scheduling these findings suggest that published values for moisture content at 33 kpa pressure that are based on many samples e g rawls et al 1982 are adequate for predicting fc in most soils without layers of high clay content that could result in perched water however for soils with high sand content like the sand and loamy sand in this study the published values will probably be too low in every case observing the sensor data after rainfall or irrigation even if it was not a large enough event to saturate the soil will help to indicate if the fc value being used is appropriate 3 5 apparent electrical conductivity in non saline soils like the field in this study eca is often used as a proxy for soil texture and vories et al 2020 used eca from the 0 5 m doe to estimate the average sand in the top 533 mm of the soil profile in the east half of this study field fig 6 shows the eca quartiles for the field based on the 0 5 m doe the eca survey of the west half of the field occurred 4 days later than the east and therefore the soil would have dried some which would affect the measurements however for this preliminary analysis any differences were considered negligible because of the relationship between eca and texture possible correlations between eca at different does and the sensor based fc values were investigated using the procedure described in section 2 4 each of the 15 sensor locations was assigned eca values for the four does 0 3 m 0 5 m 0 8 m and 1 6 m based on the one or two values recorded within 2 2 m of the site those values were correlated with the four fc values obtained for each site table 6 no significant correlations were observed with fc at the shallowest depth 152 mm or eca at the minimum doe 0 3 m however there were significant correlations between fc at each of the deeper sensors and eca at each of the deeper does much more data will be required to determine if a relationship between eca and fc exists however soil eca has become a common measurement and many agricultural service providers offer the service if a relationship can be developed it would be a much faster and less expensive way to estimate fc than collecting and analyzing soil cores 4 conclusions field capacity or a well drained upper limit of soil moisture content is an essential component for determining plant available water or the difference between moisture content at field capacity and permanent wilting point for irrigation management laboratory measurements are widely available in the literature and in many cases they are adequate however field measurements often differ from the published values for coarser textured soils as seen in this study the higher than expected field capacity values observed in this study could negatively impact irrigated crops due to waterlogging or water deficit stress observing the sensor data after rainfall or irrigation even if it was not a large enough event to saturate the soil will help to indicate if the value being used is appropriate county soil surveys do not provide detailed enough information on soil texture in many cases and with the capability for site specific water application more precise methods are needed for determining plant available water these findings suggest that apparent electrical conductivity may be able to replace extensive soil sampling in the future but more research is needed the principal findings of this study were although water continued to move in the profile for more than 24 h after saturation with more change at the shallower depths the average change between 24 and 48 h at each observed depth was 0 015 m3 m 3 coarser textured soils were much wetter after 24 h than expected based on published values at 33 kpa these findings are consistent with information from other researchers that suggested field capacity for sandy soils is at 10 kpa even a small difference in sensor location between years 1 5 m had a large effect on the observed field capacity at some depths which suggests that new texture samples

10127,irrigated agriculture is a major consumer of freshwater and acreage of irrigated land has increased as producers have become increasingly reliant on irrigation to ensure adequate yields and reduce production risks information about the soil s field capacity or the water content after a saturated soil has drained for at least 24 h is needed to determine the soil s readily available water or the amount of water that can be safely removed by plants to address the challenges associated with using soil water sensors in highly variable soils soil water measurements were included in ongoing cotton irrigation studies during the 2017 through 2019 growing seasons at the university of missouri fisher delta research center near portageville sensor based field capacity values were compared among multiple commercially available sensors time domain reflectometry sensors acclima tdr 315 were installed at four depths and five locations each of the three years in addition resistance type sensors irrometer watermark 200ss were installed at five depths and five locations for two years the goal was to provide guidance on how best to use soil moisture sensor data for irrigation management although water continued to move in the profile for more than 24 h after saturation the average change between 24 and 48 h at each observed depth was 0 015 m3 m 3 observed values for coarser textured soils were much wetter after 24 h than expected based on published field capacity values and in one case even a small difference in sensor location had a large effect on the observed field capacity furthermore soil apparent electrical conductivity was highly correlated to measured field capacity which could result in a much faster and less expensive way to estimate field capacity compared to collecting and analyzing soil cores these findings demonstrate that the application of soil moisture sensors for irrigation management is site specific and differences can be observed over short distances within a field the research is continuing to better meet the needs of agricultural producers consultants research and extension personnel and others for information to improve irrigation management keywords soil moisture sensor soil water content irrigation scheduling water management 1 introduction irrigated agriculture in the usa is a major consumer of freshwater and accounts for approximately 80 of the nation s consumptive water use schaible and aillery 2015 irrigation is required for crop production in arid and semiarid regions however acreage of irrigated land has increased in more humid portions of the usa the usa mid south region including the lower mississippi river valley is one of the major crop production regions in the united states and producers there have become increasingly reliant on irrigation to ensure adequate yields and reduce production risks vories and evett 2014 typical precipitation exceeds 1000 mm annually in this area but generally 20 occurs during june to august when crops require large quantities of water precipitation patterns frequently include heavy rainfall events that cause runoff with only a small amount of the rainfall becoming available for plant use while a producer can control the application rate to minimize runoff from sprinkler irrigation knowing how much of a rainfall or a surface irrigation was effective in reaching the root zone is challenging irrigation scheduling methods include weather based soil moisture based and plant based methods weather based methods schedule irrigation based on the estimated amount of water lost by plant evapotranspiration et and the amount of effective rainfall and irrigation water entering the plant root zone soil based methods measure soil water content or matric potential levels in the plant root zone and irrigation is applied when there is a shortage of available water for plants plant based methods directly detect plant responses to water stress and irrigation is initialized as plants indicate water stress stetson and mecham 2011 soil water content can be directly determined using the manual gravimetric method asabe standards 2019 collecting weighing and drying soil samples however the method is time consuming and expensive similarly the neutron probe is reliable and accurate for measuring soil water content chanasyk and naeth 1996 but its application has been limited by the cost and special requirements associated with handling the radioactive source electromagnetic em sensors such as electrical capacitance and resistance type sensors and time domain reflectometry tdr devices have been developed and widely adopted for soil moisture measurement in irrigation scheduling evett and parkin 2005 miranda et al 2005 o shaughnessy and sui 2018 sui 2018 sui and vories 2020 sui and baggard 2015 in general previous research indicated that the em sensors were inexpensive easy to install and maintain and able to provide useful information for irrigation scheduling feng and sui 2020 investigated sensor calibration in undisturbed soil for multiple sensors and observed improved performance above factory calibration with in situ calibration however datta et al 2018 showed strong agreement between the factory calibration and a local calibration for the acclima tdr 315 tdr sensors acclima meridian id usa in a low salinity low clay soil similarly evett et al 2019 reported reasonable accuracy for the acclima tdr 315l tdr sensors an update to the 315 with a lower energy requirement across a range of soil textures from fine sandy loam to clay to determine the operating parameters for weather based or sensor based irrigation schedulers some idea of the soil water retention curve or the relationship between water content and matric potential is needed to determine the amount of water that can be removed from the soil before needing replacement in general the total available water is considered to be the portion between field capacity fc and permanent wilting point wp fc is the soil water content after a thoroughly wetted soil has drained for some period typically 24 h evett et al 2019 a laboratory determined value of the water content of a soil core after a pressure of 33 kpa has been applied to a saturated soil is often considered the fc however a simple definition of fc is not always possible because water retention in a soil profile depends on the transmission properties of the entire profile rather than at a particular point baver et al 1972 large errors in water retention estimates may occur from the association of field capacity with a particular water potential hansen et al 1979 and some researchers refer to the field drained value as a well drained upper limit to avoid confusion with the laboratory value similarly a laboratory determined value of the water content of a soil core after a pressure of 1 5 mpa has been applied to a saturated soil is generally considered the wp while the wp value is also not a constant the fact that water content does not change very much at high tensions makes the exact wp value much less important than fc laboratory determined fc and wp values based on soil texture are widely available in the literature e g hansen et al 1979 ratliff et al 1983 while some published values are from single sites rawls et al 1982 reported values based on 1323 soils from 32 usa states however even within a texture class there is a wide range of observed values and rawls et al 1982 reported an average value for sand of 0 091 m3 m 3 with a standard deviation of 0 073 m3 m 3 furthermore how the texture class is determined for a specific sensor location can be a challenge soil cores can be collected near the sensors and tested but few row crop producers would go to that trouble and expense for one season even when soil cores were used sui and vories 2020 observed that in a highly variable soil the sensor readings did not always agree with the core analyses the u s department of agriculture s natural resources conservation service nrcs has published county soil surveys for most usa counties often the only spatial soil texture data available to farmers is the county soil survey but the precision is not adequate for many site specific applications electrical conductivity measurement of bulk soil referred to as apparent electrical conductivity eca integrates conductance through the soil solution through contact of solid soil particles and via exchangeable cations that exist at the solid liquid interface of clay minerals corwin and lesch 2003 mobile measurements of soil eca have become widely used to map soil variability because eca responds to several important soil properties and mobile measurements are relatively quick and inexpensive in non saline soils most of the variation in eca is a function of soil texture moisture content bulk density and cation exchange capacity cec corwin and lesch 2005 samples collected from the field and analyzed for texture can be used to relate texture and eca in a field eca data have been used to estimate the depth of flood induced sand deposition kitchen et al 1996 the topsoil depth above a subsoil claypan horizon doolittle et al 1994 or soil texture over a complete profile or for specific layers sudduth et al 2005 vories et al 2020 in some regions fields contain very sandy areas that are too small to appear on most soil surveys freeland et al 2008 such areas can be important to irrigation management due to the low plant available water associated with sand although the sandy areas will appear as relatively low eca many agricultural soils have high sand content and the especially sandy areas might be difficult to differentiate from the surrounding soil in addition because the eca response with depth is non linear dualem 2014 the eca associated with sand at one depth in the profile is not the same as for sand at a different depth vories et al 2020 were only able to achieve r2 0 658 between sand in the top 533 mm and eca for 0 5 m depth of exploration doe the depth at which 70 of the cumulative response is obtained in a highly variable soil with the challenges associated with using soil water sensors in highly variable soils there are always questions regarding understanding and interpreting the data therefore the objective of this study was to compare sensor based fc values among multiple commercial sensors based on factory calibration over three years and investigate trends to provide guidance on how best to use the sensor data to aid in irrigation scheduling 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site soil water content measurements were included in ongoing cotton irrigation studies during the 2017 through 2019 growing seasons similarly soil matric potential measurements were included during the 2017 and 2018 seasons the study field located at the university of missouri fisher delta research center near portageville 36 41 n 89 70 w is approximately 10 ha i e 320 m by 320 m with the primary slope 2 mm m 1 in the south to north direction and a cross slope 1 mm m 1 in the west to east direction daily and hourly weather data were collected approximately 600 m from the most distant part of the study site and placed on the university of missouri agricultural electronic bulletin board agebb http agebb missouri edu the study was in the east half of the field in 2017 and 2019 and the west half in 2018 the field is located roughly 14 km west of the mississippi river and lies within the new madrid seismic zone the combination of alluvial eolian and seismic activity over the years has resulted in highly variable soils in the region 2 2 soils soil map units within the study field included dundee silt loam de fine silty mixed

thermic aquic udifluvents and tiptonville silt loam tp fine silty mixed superactive thermic oxyaquic argiudolls with tp comprising the majority of the field usda scs 1971 fig 1 however the field contains areas of high sand content that are often too small to show up in the soils map and the county soil survey reported that sandy loam overwash makes up about 20 of the tiptonville area usda scs 1971 to provide higher resolution soil information mobile eca data were collected on 13 june 2019 east half and 17 june 2019 west half the dualem 1hs system dualem milton on canada used has dual geometry receivers at separations of 1 and ½ m from the transmitter to provide simultaneous 0 3 0 5 0 8 and 1 6 m does dualem 2014 data were collected on a 1 s interval at a 2 1 m s 1 overland speed and a 3 9 m transect spacing location of each data point was determined with a global navigation satellite system gnss using an ag leader gps 7500 receiver ag leader technology ames ia usa with terrastar c pro differential correction with pass to pass accuracy of 30 60 mm ag leader technology 2019 in addition soil texture data sand silt and clay fractions from laboratory analysis were obtained from multiple locations within the study field the sampling locations were selected for their proximity to soil moisture sensors placed in the field in 2017 additional cores were obtained near two of the 2018 locations fig 1 the soil cores were 51 mm in diameter and generally 838 mm in length and were divided into five to seven sections with the uppermost section comprising the layer from the surface to 76 mm and each of the lower sections in 152 mm increments 2 3 sensors before planting the field was bedded using disc hippers in the north south direction with a row spacing of 0 97 m the fields were planted in may and two types of soil sensors were installed in early to mid july and remained in the field until early october a total of sixteen acclima tdr 315 and four acclima tdr 315l tdr sensors included in the ongoing cotton study were placed at depths of 152 305 457 and 610 mm below the soil surface on 12 july 2017 16 july 2018 and 3 july 2019 fig 1 the 315l was an update of the 315 with lower power requirements additional information regarding the acclima sensors was provided by schwartz et al 2016 and wilson et al 2020 the first portion of the sensor label in fig 1 represents the irrigation plot of the ongoing study with the final two digits denoting the year the sensor was installed in that location e g p15 18 represents the sensors in plot p15 in 2018 the surface of the soil bed was approximately 10 cm above the bottom of the furrow when the sensors were installed a hole was dug in the furrow beside the bed and the sensors were inserted horizontally into the undisturbed bed at the desired depths a probe guide was used to ensure that the waveguide rods remained parallel when the probe was pushed into the soil the four sensors at each location were connected to a cr206x datalogger campbell scientific logan ut usa and read at hourly 2017 or 15 minute 2018 2019 intervals with the data wirelessly transmitted to a central computer equipped with a campbell scientific rf401a spread spectrum radio the sensors were removed shortly before harvest each year on 2 october 2017 11 october 2018 and 10 october 2019 watermark 200ss sensors irrometer co riverside calif usa were installed at five depths 152 305 457 610 and 762 mm below the soil surface within approximately 1 m of the tdr sensors fig 1 in 2017 and 2018 the watermark sensor which estimates tension based on resistance was selected because it is a relatively inexpensive sensor that is widely used e g vellidis research group undated henry et al 2020 rix et al 2020 the five sensors were constructed in a single probe by advanced ag systems dothan al usa to minimize the soil disturbance that would have been caused by five individual sensors while many users recommend pouring a soil slurry into the hole before placing the sensors irmak et al 2016 reported that the slurry could introduce additional measurement problems therefore no slurry was used the sensors were inserted in the plant row from the top of the soil bed which minimized the chance of water ponding near the sensor the five sensors at each location were connected to a 900 m watermark monitor and the data were recorded at 30 minute intervals no soil temperature sensor was used and no temperature adjustments were made the recorded soil moisture tension values based on the internal calibration in the 900 m monitor were manually downloaded 2 4 data management the large spatially referenced data sets were managed with arcgis for desktop 10 4 1 esri redlands ca usa to construct a data set containing the eca data nearest a soil sensor location the aggregating procedure described by griffin et al 2007 and vories et al 2015 was followed with all eca data points within 2 2 m of a sensor location averaged the 2 2 m radius was selected to ensure that each location had at least one associated eca value sas for windows 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc usa was used for statistical analyses and tests of significance were conducted at the alpha 5 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall fig 2 shows the cumulative rainfall observed after sensor installation each year for the months of august and september while rain events large enough to saturate the soil profile often do not occur during the growing season during the time the sensors were logging in each of the three years there were extended wet periods table 1 contains the saturation rainfall dates for all three years in 2017 and 2018 the adjacent watermark sensors confirmed that the profile was saturated as seen for plot p11 in 2017 fig 3 as is often the case in hydrologic studies it was difficult to delineate the rainfall events in this case the beginning was defined as a measurable hourly rainfall i e 0 25 mm after at least one day with no rainfall recorded similarly the end was defined as the last measurable hourly rainfall before at least one day with no rainfall the sensor based fc was the value 24 h after the end of the rainfall period while evett et al 2019 stated that 24 h is a typical drain time and colman 1947 reported that soil moisture remained substantially constant after the first day some researchers recommend a longer period sui and vories 2020 used 48 h to determine a sensor based fc however the sensor reading difference between 24 h and 48 h was generally less than 0 01 m3 m 3 r sui personal communication 9 september 2020 in this study rainfall was observed before 48 h in 2018 however in 2017 and 2019 it was possible to compare the sensor based values at 24 h and 48 h after the rainfall event the average value at 48 h was 0 0084 m3 m 3 less than the 24 h value and since there was a crop in the field evapotranspiration would account for some of the difference although the effect of year was not significant sensor depth was significant table 2 indicating that water was still moving in the profile after 24 h however the average change at any depth was 0 015 m3 m 3 3 2 watermark sensors initially it was hoped that a site specific relationship between soil matric potential and volumetric water content could be developed by locating the tdrs and watermark sensors adjacent to each other even though the watermark sensors only measure tension 239 kpa as seen in fig 3 that is the range most important to crop production many sources e g irmak et al 2016 present general relationships however the specific relationships determined in different locations in a highly variable field would be useful in interpreting the data for irrigation management one of the best examples of the observed data in this study was for the 152 mm sensors in plot p11 in 2017 fig 4 the same plot included in fig 3 the effects of hysteresis observed in the data together with the frequent rainfalls and irrigations and the narrow range of tension observed in some of the deeper sensors led to weak relationships in almost all cases in addition data losses were common often due to wildlife damage while watermark sensors are often recommended for irrigation scheduling e g vellidis research group undated henry et al 2020 rix et al 2020 this study did not provide sufficient information on which to base any guidelines for their use therefore the watermark data were primarily used qualitatively to indicate whether the soil around a sensor was saturated no watermark sensors were installed in 2019 3 3 county soil survey even though soil eca surveys have become common most only indicate variability and are not calibrated to indicate actual soil texture standard grower practice in many areas is to use the county soil survey map units rather than extensive soil sampling and testing it can be seen in fig 1 that based on the pemiscot county missouri soil survey usda scs 1971 13 of the sensor sites 52 sensors were located within the tiptonville silt loam map unit tp while 2 sites 8 sensors were located within the steele sandy loam map unit st table 3 contains the fc averages based on map unit with only two sites in st little can be concluded however the high coefficients of variation cv show that there was much variability between the two sites the averages for the 13 sites in tp all fell within the 1 standard deviation sd values reported by rawls et al 1982 for laboratory values for silt loam there was quite a lot of variability which is not surprising considering that sandy loam overwash was reported to make up about 20 of the tp area usda scs 1971 for site specific irrigation more precise soil information and fc values are needed 3 4 soil cores by design all ten of the sensor sites in 2017 and 2019 were located very near soil sampling sites fig 1 fewer samples were collected from the west half of the field and only two of the sites in 2018 were near soil sampling sites although three samples were damaged and one of the sensors malfunctioned for a short time there were 44 combinations of measured texture for the cores and the observed sensor based fc for the adjacent sensors table 4 the coarser textures especially sand and loamy sand had the largest differences with the values published by rawls et al 1982 with much higher moisture content at fc than the texture suggested this is not surprising because all of rawls values were for water retained at a pressure of 33 kpa while hansen et al 1979 reported that fc for sandy soils tended to be nearer 10 kpa baver et al 1972 presented graphs of 16 soils based on five pressures from 10 kpa to 1 5 mpa that demonstrated the large differences in moisture content between 10 and 33 kpa hansen et al 1979 who discussed the tendency for fc at lower tension for coarser textured soils presented an average fc value for sandy texture of 0 15 m3 m 3 which is higher than the rawls et al 1982 value for sand 0 09 m3 m 3 but lower than the average for the sand measurements in this study 0 20 m3 m 3 ratliff et al 1983 reported a field determined average fc for 76 samples of sand as 0 11 m3 m 3 which was also much lower than the average in this study averages from the 9 sand and 12 loamy sand samples in this study were both 1 sd higher than the averages for 762 sand and 338 loamy sand samples reported by rawls et al 1982 table 4 values for the other textures were within 1 sd of the rawls et al 1982 value the higher values can occur when there is clay in the deeper layers causing perched water however clay contents were low in this field in all but two cases at least one deeper sample was collected below the sensor depth two of the sites had 90 sand content and were not stable enough to collect a deeper sample of all the samples tested the highest observed clay content was 34 and most were 20 it is unlikely that there was perched water in this study therefore the observed differences were probably due to fc for these sandy soils being nearer to 10 than 33 kpa as hansen et al 1979 and others reported in practice the higher than expected fc values could have a negative impact on irrigated crops if weather based irrigation scheduling calculated available water based on the lower fc value there would be more water than expected remaining in the soil when water was added and waterlogging could occur conversely if irrigation thresholds for sensor based scheduling were based on the lower fc value more of the total available water i e fc wp would be used before irrigation was recommended which could result in some degree of water deficit stress sensors were placed in two of the same plots in 2019 as 2017 fig 1 p8 and p15 which presented the opportunity to compare the sensor based fc between years table 5 the same sensors were used in the same plot and at the same depth in both years it is seldom possible to return to the exact same site and the two sensor locations in p8 were approximately 1 5 m apart while the sites in p15 were approximately 2 5 m apart in plot p8 the fc values were lower in 2017 even though the watermark sensor indicated that soil at all depths to 762 mm was saturated however the relationship among the sensors suggested the soil profiles were different fig 5 in 2017 three of the sensors appeared to be in a coarser soil texture while the fourth 457 mm appeared to be in a finer textured soil fig 5a however in 2019 the two shallower sensors appeared to be in a coarser soil texture and the two deeper appeared to be in a finer textured soil fig 5b even though the locations were not far apart the complex soil layering in the field affected the observed fc values which suggests that new texture samples would be needed each year the sensor responses were more similar in p15 even though the sensor locations were further apart with regard to irrigation scheduling these findings suggest that published values for moisture content at 33 kpa pressure that are based on many samples e g rawls et al 1982 are adequate for predicting fc in most soils without layers of high clay content that could result in perched water however for soils with high sand content like the sand and loamy sand in this study the published values will probably be too low in every case observing the sensor data after rainfall or irrigation even if it was not a large enough event to saturate the soil will help to indicate if the fc value being used is appropriate 3 5 apparent electrical conductivity in non saline soils like the field in this study eca is often used as a proxy for soil texture and vories et al 2020 used eca from the 0 5 m doe to estimate the average sand in the top 533 mm of the soil profile in the east half of this study field fig 6 shows the eca quartiles for the field based on the 0 5 m doe the eca survey of the west half of the field occurred 4 days later than the east and therefore the soil would have dried some which would affect the measurements however for this preliminary analysis any differences were considered negligible because of the relationship between eca and texture possible correlations between eca at different does and the sensor based fc values were investigated using the procedure described in section 2 4 each of the 15 sensor locations was assigned eca values for the four does 0 3 m 0 5 m 0 8 m and 1 6 m based on the one or two values recorded within 2 2 m of the site those values were correlated with the four fc values obtained for each site table 6 no significant correlations were observed with fc at the shallowest depth 152 mm or eca at the minimum doe 0 3 m however there were significant correlations between fc at each of the deeper sensors and eca at each of the deeper does much more data will be required to determine if a relationship between eca and fc exists however soil eca has become a common measurement and many agricultural service providers offer the service if a relationship can be developed it would be a much faster and less expensive way to estimate fc than collecting and analyzing soil cores 4 conclusions field capacity or a well drained upper limit of soil moisture content is an essential component for determining plant available water or the difference between moisture content at field capacity and permanent wilting point for irrigation management laboratory measurements are widely available in the literature and in many cases they are adequate however field measurements often differ from the published values for coarser textured soils as seen in this study the higher than expected field capacity values observed in this study could negatively impact irrigated crops due to waterlogging or water deficit stress observing the sensor data after rainfall or irrigation even if it was not a large enough event to saturate the soil will help to indicate if the value being used is appropriate county soil surveys do not provide detailed enough information on soil texture in many cases and with the capability for site specific water application more precise methods are needed for determining plant available water these findings suggest that apparent electrical conductivity may be able to replace extensive soil sampling in the future but more research is needed the principal findings of this study were although water continued to move in the profile for more than 24 h after saturation with more change at the shallower depths the average change between 24 and 48 h at each observed depth was 0 015 m3 m 3 coarser textured soils were much wetter after 24 h than expected based on published values at 33 kpa these findings are consistent with information from other researchers that suggested field capacity for sandy soils is at 10 kpa even a small difference in sensor location between years 1 5 m had a large effect on the observed field capacity at some depths which suggests that new texture samples would be needed each year in some cases soil apparent electrical conductivity was highly correlated to measured field capacity and should be investigated further disclaimer the mention of trade names

10128,rice is the high water consumption crop that feeds more than half of the world population the planting area of cold region rice is expanded rapidly in recent years due to the high market values also resulting in increasing water shortages and eco environmental problems on a regional scale pursuing high benefits and increasing water use efficiency become more significant both for stakeholders and managers to understand the yield variation and water saving potential the specific rice model oryza2000 was adopted to predict the responses of rice growth yield and water use to the various climatic and irrigation conditions in a typical cold region of northeast china field experiments were conducted for the japonica rice in cold regions jrc during 2018 and 2019 with detailed observations on rice growth and development the oryza2000 was calibrated and validated using two year experimental data simulated ponded water depth various organ development and yield fitted well with field observations a set of recommended values of crop parameters for jrc was obtained through the systematic parametrization showing very specific and different characters from the varieties in warmer regions the irrigation scheduling module was modified for adapting to the various irrigation regimes after that the scenario simulation with 30 year different climatic data i e 1990 2019 and three different irrigation regimes i e traditional flood irrigation tfi shallow wet irrigation swi and controlled irrigation cti were conducted using the calibrated model status evaluation and scenario analyses indicated that the crop yield of jrc varied significantly due to relatively large fluctuations of photothermal conditions in different years the inter annual potential yield varied from 6790 to 9516 kg ha 1 with an average of 8210 kg ha 1 evaluation on water saving scenarios indicated that adopting swi and cti regimes could averagely save up to 90 mm and 140 mm 20 and 30 of irrigation water in dry years respectively compared with tfi regime overall the obtained set of parameters for jrc could efficiently complement the parameter database for rice modeling in cold regions meanwhile the yield and water saving evaluation could provide very useful information and the basis for supporting the future jrc production and water saving management keywords rice growth simulation crop model parameters potential yield water saving analysis oryza cold regions 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is a major staple food for the world s population which is cultivated under a range of environments at latitudes ranging from 35 s to 53 n and at elevations reaching to 2000 m yoshida 1981 rice production is essential to the worldwide food security it is also the largest water consumer in agriculture and 75 of the world s rice production is grown with irrigation devkota et al 2013 the indica rice and japonica rice are two widely cultivated rice types the former is mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical areas reaching maturity twice or three times per year the latter is planted in temperate and cold regions with higher latitude with one growing season per year and less sensitive to the low temperature guo et al 2019 in recent years the japonica rice becomes more popular as main food on the table due to its good taste while the indica rice is increasingly processed into rice products particularly the japonica rice in cold regions hereafter called jrc which is mainly concentrated in northeast china north japan and korean peninsula has obviously higher quality price and economic values than that in other regions mao et al 2017 shimono 2011 wang et al 2013 nakajima et al 2017 thus it is very attractive to understand the possible yield variation of jrc under different conditions both for farmers and policy makers during the last decade the planting area of cold region rice has expanded rapidly in northeast china due to the increasing food demand and the high benefits e g with plant area increased from 2 68 million ha in 2000 5 11 million ha in 2018 nbsc 2020 irrigation is critical for rice growth in cold regions where the rainfall is not timely and sufficient enough in normal years the rising irrigation demand exacerbates the water shortages and conflicts for different water users in the watersheds this has caused agricultural drought and grain yield reduction in local regions yang et al 2017 and as well some eco environment problems due to excessive groundwater exploitation and aquifer drawdown liu and liu 2006 zhang et al 2012 various water saving practices wsps are proposed to reduce irrigation water use for jrc on both farm and regional scales particularly with emphasis on field water saving irrigation e g controlled irrigation and shallow wet irrigation wang and zhang 2015 zhao et al 2015 therefore a thorough understanding of water saving potential with different wsps is very necessary and significant for rational water use management and jrc planting in the future rice growth and water consumption are various and affected by genotype environment and management field experiment is the basis to understand these relationships while it is costly laborious and time consuming due to the various and changing conditions ren et al 2016 using the well calibrated validated crop model is an effective way to evaluate the effects of ambient environmental changes on rice production and the coping strategies crop models could simulate the plant biomass or organ development based on the plant physiology or morphology processes yang et al 2004 van ittersum et al 2003 one kind belongs to the generic models that simulate multi processes without regards to crop species which is often fine tuned to describe the phonological and physiological traits of rice e g the application of aquacrop epic and cropsyst maniruzzaman et al 2015 xu et al 2019 sandra et al 2016 confalonieri and bocchi 2005 in contrast another kind of rice specific model has more detailed and accurate description for rice variety attributes and paddy field conditions typically as oryza and ceres rice bouman et al 2001 ritchie et al 1987 hoogenboom et al 2015 researchers have conducted extensive modeling studies on rice in tropical subtropical areas however to our knowledge there are still few studies which focus on the systematical parameterization and simulation of rice growth in cold regions in particular the reference values of crop growth parameters are rarely reported for jrc the objectives of this paper are to 1 conduct a systematical parameterization of growth model and provide the reference parameter values for rice modeling in cold regions 2 assess the yield variation under various climatic years and analyze the main impact factors and 3 evaluate the water saving potential with adopting water saving irrigation regimes the detailed field observation experiments were carried out in the cold region of northeast china the widely used rice model oryza2000 was parameterized and calibrated and then used to evaluate the climatic yields and water saving potential with various climatic years and irrigation regimes the research could provide the significant parameter reference for future modeling work on jrc and very valuable information for improving rice production and water use in cold regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments 2 1 1 location climate soils crop and irrigation field experiments were conducted at qing an irrigation experimental station 46 58 06 n 127 39 37 e in the songnen plain of northeast china in 2018 and 2019 the region where the station located is a typical cold area of china with the mean annual temperature of 2 5 and mean monthly temperature ranging from 30 3 in january to 27 1 in july it has the middle temperate and sub humid continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is 635 mm during 1990 2019 with about 75 occurring between june and september the number of frost free days average 130 per year daily meteorological data of sunshine duration maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity and wind speed for 2018 and 2019 were taken from the nearby tieli weather station and were used to compute the fao penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto according to allen et al 1998 the monthly averages of the main weather variables are presented in fig 1 the soil profile at the experimental site has very typical layered soil characteristics of lowland paddy fields the upper layer is a muddy puddled layer with silty loam soils about 25 cm thickness with little resistance to water flow the second interlayer layer is a plow sole about 15 cm thickness with a large resistance to water flow and the deeper layer is the non puddled soils with sandy type texture table 1 lists the main soil physical properties and soil hydraulic parameters of the studied soil experimental site soil samples were collected by a soil auger from surface to 100 cm soil depth for texture analysis the particle size distribution was measured using a laser particle size analyzer malvern ms2000 uk the dry bulk density was obtained by oven drying undisturbed soil samples of 100 cm3 ring sampler for 48 h the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s of each soil layer i e 0 10 cm 10 25 cm and 25 40 cm was measured by using guelph permeameter 2800k1 usa after harvest for soil depth of 40 80 cm k s was estimated using the hypres pedo transfer functions wösten et al 1999 according to the measured percentages of sand silt and clay particles and bulk density the japonica rice variety of suijing 18 was used because it is widely grown in the region with high quality and benefits the crop was sown on april 15th and transplanted on may 16th in both 2018 and 2019 while it was harvested on september 18th and 21st in 2018 and 2019 respectively the planting density was 20 hills per m2 and 5 plants per hill the field conditions could be more representative of the situations of high standard farmland which has uniform and regular field size and could benefit from the realization of fully mechanized operations and efficient irrigation fertilization management compared to lysimeter pit or small plot experiments traditional flood irrigation i e basin irrigation was applied in our experiment other cultivation practices including fertilizer application and pest crop disease and weed control were similar to the practices commonly recommended by agricultural technician in the region 2 1 2 field observation and data field hydrological conditions and crop growth were monitored from planting to harvest during the crop seasons of 2018 and 2019 in particular a detailed observation was carried out for crop growth including monitoring the development of various crop organs the observations related to soils and crops were carried out in three experimental fields with three time replications in each field during 2018 while the similar observations were conducted in one field with three time replications during 2019 considering the labor and time consumption and field planning rearrangement the ponded water depth was measured using a vertical ruler when there was ponding water in the field soil water content was measured by oven drying method at the depth of 0 10 cm 10 25 cm 25 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm during field drying stages irrigation amount in each field was recorded by water meter 100 ml precision which was installed at the inlet of the water supply pipe rainfall was recorded every hour with an automatic rain gauge hobo rg3 m usa during the crop seasons groundwater depth was monitored every an hour with an automatic water level recorder hobo u20 usa buried in an observation well the observed crop data included the various organ development biomass accumulation leaf area index lai and crop yield the complete plant was sampled and separated into different components roots stems green leaves dead leaves and storage organ i e panicles the dry biomass was measured by oven drying at 80 to the constant mass including the dry aboveground green biomass d agb and the dry biomass of stems green leaves dead leaves and panicles i e dwst dwgl dwdl and dwso for lai measurement the leaf length and width were measured for each leaf and the lai was calculated using eq 1 as follows han et al 2009 1 l a i 0 75 ρ 1 3 i 1 3 j 1 n l i j b i j where 0 75 is a shape factor ρ is the plant density which was calculated from the plant spacing n is the leaf number of each plant l is the leaf length and b is the leaf broad crop sampling and observation were taken at three sites within the experimental field about every 10 days during the crop seasons with higher frequency during critical development stages from transplanting to harvesting a total of 9 and 10 samplings were carried out in 2018 and 2019 respectively covering every growth stage dry grain yield was collected at 1 m2 with six replicates during harvest 2 2 model description the oryza2000 and its modification the oryza2000 is a mechanistic and dynamic eco physiological model developed for simulating the rice growth bouman et al 2001 it can simulate the rice growth and yield formation with water limited and nitrogen limited conditions oryza2000 is consisted of different modules of crop growth evapotranspiration soil water balance and nitrogen dynamics it is assumed that the crop is free from disease pests and weeds in oryza2000 the model has been widely used in improving field water nitrogen management and guaranteeing rice production under various environmental conditions artacho et al 2011 yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 more comprehensive theory and description of the model could be found in detail in bouman et al 2001 a brief introduction of model principles related to this paper is given in the following parts 2 2 1 soil water balance there are four different soil water balance modules in oryza2000 and the paddy module is adopted in this study paddy is a one dimensional multi layer up to 10 model that can be used for both puddled and non puddled conditions in irrigated and rainfed environments the water balance of a lowland rice field is calculated as follows 2 δ w δ w s δ h p o n d i r c e t s p d where all units in mm d 1 δw is the change of total stored water δw s and δh pond are the changes of soil water storage and surface ponded water depth respectively i is the irrigation supply r is the rainfall c is the capillary rise from groundwater e is the soil evaporation t is the crop transpiration s is the seepage loss through the lateral ridge p is the vertical percolation and d is the surface drainage runoff bund overflow the calculation of water balance is applied to the surface ponded water layer and each of the layers in the soil profile see detail in bouman et al 2001 the model could simulate all the water balance components and the status of ponded water depth and layered soil moistures at a given time step the irrigation rainfall and capillary rise are the sources to recharge to soil water capillary rise from the groundwater to a soil layer is assumed to occur only if soil water tension is greater than that corresponding to field capacity it is estimated as a function of hydraulic conductivity soil water tension and distance to water table on the basis of the darcy equation the penman monteith method is adopted to calculate eto it is further separated into the radiation term et rd and the aerodynamic term et ae for estimating the potential evaporation rate and transpiration rate e p and t p the actual evaporation rate and transpiration rate e a and t a were finally determined with considering the soil water stress lateral seepage occurring in terraces is estimated based on the darcy equation vertical percolation through plough sole layer is calculated using an iterative newton raphson procedure wolfram 1991 from hydraulic conductivity characteristics soil water potential gradient and soil thickness of the plow sole the water in excess of field capacity is drained out of the layer with a maximum rate equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the layer the ponded water depth exceeding bund height is assumed as runoff after accounting for evapotranspiration and percolation loss in addition the soil moisture characteristics and hydraulic conductivity are described with van genuchten mualem vg m equations van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 2 2 2 crop growth and yield the crop module in oryza2000 is specifically developed for simulating the rice growth and yield formulation this crop model is driven by radiation and accumulated temperature taking good account of photosynthesis respiration and senescence it follows the daily calculation scheme for the rates of dry matter production of the plant organs and the rate of phenological development bouman et al 2001 the dry matter production is simulated on the basis of the balance between daily co2 assimilation and respiration and partitioned among the various plant organs depending on the allocation rates this model could be applied for various rice varieties with given specific parameters the crop development stage dvs is divided into two parts based on accumulated temperature vegetative growth period and reproductive growth period the total daily dry matter increment is partitioned into roots stems leaves and panicles according to the partition coefficient of various development stages the effects of water stress and nitrogen stress on crop growth could be considered when the soil moisture or nitrogen is deficit in the root zone the other factors including maximum minimum temperature and photoperiod may affect the crop development rate and biomass production 2 2 3 irrigation scheduling design in oryza2000 irrigation can be scheduled according to the controlled criteria of irrigation timing and application depth irrigation time can be determined by different trigger conditions including the lower limit options of critical ponded water depth critical soil water tension content or days after the disappearance of ponded water only one kind of trigger conditions can be selected in a simulation however some water saving irrigation regimes e g shallow wet irrigation may require different trigger conditions during different stages thus the module was modified so that the lower limit options could be changed with crop development stages according to user setting the application depth is determined by a user specified value which is kept the same throughout the whole growing season however this value should be dynamic in practice for different stages more importantly the application depth for the kinds of controlled irrigation are almost determined based on the desired ponded water depth after irrigation thus the application depth criteria were modified to be as a function of crop development stages and a new option was added for computing the irrigation application depth irad cm as follows 3 i r a d x t i 1 n δ d i θ s i θ i where n is the number of soil layers above the plow sole layer d is the thickness of i th soil layer cm θ is the actual soil water content cm3 cm 3 θ s is the saturated soil water content cm3 cm 3 t is the time d and x is the user specified value of ponded water depth after irrigation i e the upper limit of ponded water depth cm 2 3 model setup parameterization calibration and validation a soil profile with 80 cm depth which had three horizons according to the observation table 1 was specified during simulations the soil domain was further divided into ten layers in simulation 5 cm thickness for the first five layers 15 cm thickness for the sixth layer i e plough sole layer and 10 cm thickness for the below four layers the simulation period was from late april to late september covering the entire rice growing season initial soil water contents were set up based on the observation value before steeping field i e the initial flooding before transplant all of the balance terms in eq 2 were considered in simulation except the lateral seepage loss through field ridge due to the relatively flat terrain in experimental sites the datasets relative to 2018 and 2019 were used to calibrate and validate the model respectively the calibration was first performed for soil hydrological process and then for crop growth process for the soil hydraulic parameters θ s and k s were set up with the measured values while the initial values of other parameters in vg m equations were estimated using the hypres pedo transfer functions wösten et al 1999 table 1 some initial crop parameters were determined on the basis of the measured values mainly including basic temperature values for development and leaf area growth specific leaf area sla and partition coefficients of dry matter while other parameters were set as default values bouman et al 2001 the irrigation depth and time during the calibration and validation were specified according to the experimental records table 2 the calibration was conducted by a trial and error approach particularly aiming to provide the basic reference values of crop parameters for the cold region rice the calibration is first performed for field hydrological process and then for crop growth process the soil parameters were calibrated based on the observed ponded water depth the crop parameters were calibrated based on the observed biomass of various plant organs i e stems leaves and panicles and lai most crop parameters are universal for all rice cultivars while some are variety specific ones bouman et al 2001 according to the previous studies bouman et al 2001 tan et al 2019 and our field observations the main calibrated crop parameters were basic temperature parameters development rates partition coefficients of dry matter sla leaf death rate drlv table 3 since some soil and crop parameters as shown in tables 1 and 3 were actually measured in field or laboratory with less uncertainty they were only slightly adjusted during calibration table 3 and table a1 the simulated values were then compared with the observed ones through the fitness performance indicator parameter adjustment was repeated until the simulation results can be accepted in both calibration and validation the statistical analysis was conducted for evaluating the goodness of fit between simulated and observed values the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and coefficient of regression b were used to quantify the model fitting performance detailed definitions and equations for the above indicators could be found in xu et al 2013 2 4 using the model for evaluating yield variation and irrigation water saving after proper calibration and validation the model was applied to predict the responses of rice growth yield and water use to the various climatic and irrigation conditions in scenarios the simulation was carried out for 30 years from 1990 to 2019 in order to assess the yield variation under different climatic conditions meanwhile three different irrigation regimes were adopted for assessing the water saving potential involving traditional flood irrigation tfi shallow wet irrigation swi and controlled irrigation cti the detailed controlled criteria for above irrigation regimes are presented in table 4 the swi and cti corresponded to the water saving irrigation regimes which were proposed and recommended by the local irrigation research institute lv et al 2012 the variation of rice yield during 1990 2019 was analyzed for understanding the yield potential and the adaptability of different irrigation regimes the potential yield which is defined here as the possible yield only limited by climatic factors mainly radiation and temperature could be almost obtained under tfi regimes due to no water stress with ponding conditions in addition the crop water productivity wpet kg m 3 and field water productivity wpnet kg m 3 were calculated and used to assess the water use efficiency they were defined as the grain yield divided by the actual crop evapotranspiration and by the net field water use i r d respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation results showed that the model performed well in simulating the fluctuations of ponded water depth pwd and the crop growth and yield for jrc during the calibration with 2018 data fig 2a 3a and b and table 5 the calibrated parameters related to soil hydraulic properties and crop growth are provided in tables 1 and 4 the simulated pwds were in an agreement with the observed ones fig 2a producing a mre 0 8 a rmse 1 7 cm and a nse 0 5 table 5 the simulated values for the various dry biomass i e d agb dwst dwgl and dwso and lai satisfactorily matched with the measured values fig 3ab for d agb the mre and rmse were respectively 17 9 and 638 kg ha 1 with nse reaching to 0 98 for the dwst dwgl and dwso relative to different organs the mre and rmse ranged from 22 9 0 9 and from 188 kg ha 1 to 526 kg ha 1 respectively and the nse values were between 0 86 and 0 96 table 5 the mre rmse and nse values for lai were 5 4 0 25 m2 m 2 and 0 96 respectively the simulated crop yield in 2018 was 8074 kg ha 1 which was slightly higher than the observed one 7604 738 kg ha 1 some discrepancies may be related to the destructive crop sampling which could not reflect the real continuous growth of a rice plant fig 3 all calibrated soil and crop parameters were directly used as model inputs during validation results showed that the goodness of fit indicators for pwd were also satisfactory between the simulated and observed values mre 0 7 rmse 1 3 cm nse 0 59 observations of d agb and dry organ biomass were well reproduced by the calibrated model fig 3c and table 5 the simulation produced small error rmse 584 kg ha 1 and high modeling efficiency nse 0 98 for d agb for the dwst dwgl and dwso the rmse values were between 185 and 425 kg ha 1 and the nse values were greater than 0 89 the dynamics of lai were reasonably captured by the model as well fig 3d with rmse 0 3 m2 m 2 and nse 0 95 the mre values for d agb dwst and dwgl were relatively large table 5 due to the very small observed values in initial period actually the mre would be less than 25 if the initial two observed values were not considered overall results indicated an acceptably good simulation of the crop growth process the simulated crop yield 7005 kg ha 1 was also close to the observed one 7081 566 kg ha 1 the general agreement between the simulated and measured data both calibration and validation indicated that the model performance was generally good after a detailed parameterization the calibrated model could be considered a valuable tool to evaluate field water use and crop growth yield for jrc 3 2 parameterization for jrc the values of primary crop parameters for jrc are provided in table 3 with comparison to the default values mainly for tropical subtropical rice results indicated that many crop parameters of jrc were specific and different from those of rice in warmer regions the base temperature and optimum temperature for jrc were 8 and 30 respectively which was found similar to the values for tropical subtropical rice however the lower air temperature threshold coldmin should be 8 for jrc and was obviously lower than the default value 12 this is because the jrc variety was more resistant to cold temperatures note that the phenological development parameters of jrc were quite distinctive jrc had longer growing period 130 140 days and lower development rates during various phases e g dvrj dvri dvrr and dvrp in table 3 with the lower ambient temperature the maximum relative growth rate of leaf area rgrlmx 0 0088 d 1 was relatively higher than the default value 0 0085 d 1 in tropical areas as the default value may underestimate the leaf growth in addition the fraction of photosynthetically active sunlight energy frpar that was a sensitive parameter was calibrated to be 0 45 less than the default value 0 5 this should be attributed to the lower plant density higher latitude and leaf morphology for jrc yan et al 2019 zhu et al 2010 rocha et al 2021 the dry matter partitioning coefficients of leaves stems and panicles i e flv fst and fso and the sla were obtained from measurement data and slightly adjusted during calibration table 3 these values of jrc were significantly different from the default values for example the flv was equal to 0 5 at dvs 0 5 and lower than default value of 0 6 fst was adjusted to 0 5 and 0 6 at dvs of 0 5 and 0 75 respectively the stem of jrc grew faster than tropical rice at first and then slower but with longer growth period the panicles of jrc appeared earlier but grew more slowly than the tropical rice and thus the fso was set as 0 1 and 0 4 at dvs of 0 75 and 1 0 respectively the sla was very important parameter affecting the lai changes and estimated based on the observed data and slightly adjusted in our study table 3 presented its variable values in different stages which showed significant differences between our values and the default values more other parameters affected by the difference of variety characteristic or field management are supplemented in the appendix table a1 above parameterization of crop parameters could be very meaningful to the future modeling work related to japonica rice in cold regions 3 3 water use performance and rice growth during the experimental years the dynamics of main water balance terms during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 are presented in fig 2 the two years had relatively wet climate during the growing season the rainfall amount was 655 8 mm and 804 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively with rainfall frequency of 20 and 5 based on the amounts of annual precipitation during the crop growth period however the rainfall was often unevenly distributed in time mainly occurring in summer rainy season but with less amount in spring season like 2019 this led to a spring drought and more irrigation requirement about 120 mm in 2018 compared to the very wet year 2019 table 2 and fig 2 after june the rainfall was very plentiful and irrigation was almost not needed in wet years drainage became a major issue for avoiding waterlogging especially after the continuous heavy rainfall in the summer therefore the amount of irrigation including for steeping field was 407 7 mm and 289 6 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively while drainage amount was about 231 2 mm and 247 6 mm the irrigation for jrc was mainly concentrated in the seeding and tillering stages and the difference of irrigation amount was related to the distribution of rainfall in the spring season the actual evaporation and transpiration were 246 6 mm and 270 7 mm in 2018 respectively similar to those in 2019 263 1 mm and 245 1 mm the fraction of e a to et a could be about 0 5 which was higher than the reported values of tropical subtropical rice about 0 18 0 41 jensen and rahman 1987 belder et al 2005 because the leaf coverage effects were weaker for jrc due to the slower growth rates the evapotranspiration of whole growth period for jrc about 520 mm was lower than that in warmer and rainy regions about 550 800 mm alberto et al 2011 zhang 1964 mao et al 1994 the evapotranspiration rate was about 4 2 mm d 1 which was lower than the tropical area such as india 4 9 mm d 1 and thailand 7 4 mm d 1 jensen and rahman 1987 tyagi et al 2000 the percolation through plow sole can reach to 159 9 mm and 187 9 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively this was mainly resulted from the differences of pwd fluctuations between 2018 and 2019 fig 2 due to the presence of the plow sole the effect of capillary rise from groundwater was very weak with total amount less than 1 mm in both two years although there was no significant difference in evaporation and transpiration for 2018 and 2019 the yields were different between the two years crop yield was largely affected by temperature and radiation conditions the radiation and average temperature in july and august of 2018 were higher than that of 2019 fig 1 resulting in about 7 higher of crop yield in 2018 3 4 scenario analysis for yield variation and water saving 3 4 1 responses of yield and water productivity to climatic conditions the 30 year prediction indicated that the inter annual potential yield of jrc ranged from 6790 to 9516 kg ha 1 with an average of 8210 kg ha 1 it varied significantly due to the relatively large fluctuations of photothermal conditions in cold regions compared with tropical subtropical regions fig 4 the potential yield can reach to around 8550 kg ha 1 in high radiation years e g 2001 2002 and 2017 for normal radiation years crop yield ranged from about 7900 kg ha 1to 8600 kg ha 1 e g 1991 1996 and 2000 potential yield was only 7500 7700 kg ha 1 during low radiation years in addition crop yield of jrc was also more significantly affected by the uneven distribution of radiation compared with warmer regions for example the total seasonal radiation of 2017 was similar to 2019 but the potential yield of 2017 8554 kg ha 1 was much higher than that of 2019 6837 kg ha 1 due to more radiation distributed in the critical stages for yield formation i e from late june to early september correspondingly the wpet ranged from about 1 2 kg m 3 to 1 9 kg m 3 averaging at 1 6 kg m 3 in 30 year simulation fig 5 the wpet of jrc was obviously higher than the most reported values of field rice in tropical subtropical regions the wpnet varied between 0 8 and 1 5 kg m 3 with an average of 1 1 kg m 3 moreover results showed that the crop yield with swi and cti regimes was close to the potential one however there was a slightly reductions 3 in very dry years e g 2007 2008 and 2010 due to the water stress occurring in the naturally drying period meanwhile swi and cti had the higher field water use efficiency than tfi fig 5 overall the above understanding of yield variation may provide very useful information in planting planning and policy making for farmers stakeholders or managers 3 4 2 potential for water saving irrigation tfi with the lowest cost was the highest water consuming regime for the 30 year scenario simulation the average irrigation depth of swi and cti was 293 mm and 266 mm respectively less than that of tfi 365 mm this meant that about 70 mm and 100 mm of irrigation water could be saved compared to tfi fig 6 in wet years e g 1998 2014 and 2019 the irrigation depth for tfi swi and cti was about 260 mm 195 mm and 203 mm respectively swi and cti could reduce 25 and 22 of irrigation water use compared to tfi irrigation was mainly applied in the early crop growing period especially for the year with less rainfall in spring season irrigation was almost not required in the middle and late growth period due to the sufficient rainfall in wet years for normal years e g in 2000 2005 and 2006 the irrigation depth of tfi averagely increased to 367 mm meanwhile that of swi and cti was 294 mm and 280 mm respectively saving 20 and 24 of irrigation water compared with tfi supplementary irrigation was also needed in the reproductive period for normal years due to the insufficient rainfall in the summer season compared to wet years in dry years e g in 2001 2004 and 2007 the irrigation depth was much larger and its average value reached to about 473 mm 379 mm and 333 mm for tfi swi and cti respectively swi and cti could save 20 and 30 i e 90 mm and 140 mm of irrigation water compared to tfi scenario analyses indicated that adopting swi and cti regimes could significantly reduce the irrigation water demand especially during the peak period of water use in spring season this should be very benefit to relieve the water shortage and allocation conflicts on a watershed scale particularly in dry years actually the real implementation of water saving regimes was dependent on the modernized irrigation systems e g the efficient water delivery and service system and the high standard farmland this required a large amount of investment both from the government and stakeholders and also a balance between water saving and cost thus our water saving evaluation could provide a significant basis support for making water saving practices and allocating water resources 4 conclusion the specific rice model oryza2000 was calibrated and validated for japonica rice in cold regions jrc of northeast china with using detailed field experimental data of 2018 and 2019 respectively the calibrated model could well simulate the fluctuations of ponded water depth various organ development and yield formation a set of completed crop parameter values were determined for jrc through combining the detailed observations and model parameterization results indicated that many crop parameters of jrc were quite specific especially for those related to the phenological development organ biomass partition temperature and radiation utilization our recommended sets of parameters could complement the parameter database for rice modeling in cold regions scenario prediction was carried out with 30 year different climatic data of 1990 2019 and three irrigation regimes of traditional flood irrigation tfi shallow wet irrigation swi and controlled irrigation cti status performance and scenario simulation indicated that the crop yield of jrc varied very significantly due to the large fluctuations of photothermal conditions the inter annual potential crop yield i e with tfi could range from 6790 to 9516 kg ha 1 with an average of 8210 kg ha 1 besides crop yield was also more noticeably affected by the uneven distribution of radiation during the growing season in the cold regions compared with warmer regions the wpet of jrc was higher than the most reported values of field rice in tropical subtropical regions varying between 1 2 and 1 8 kg m 3 under no water stress conditions above understanding of crop yield responses may provide very useful information in planting planning and policy making for farmers and managers simulation analysis on water saving potential indicated that the irrigation for jrc was mainly concentrated in seeding and tillering stages during the spring season after june the rainfall was relatively plentiful and the inter annual difference of irrigation amount was mainly caused by rainfall distribution in the drier spring season compared to tfi swi and cti could averagely save about 70 mm and 90 mm 20 and 24 of irrigation water in normal years respectively meanwhile they could save about 90 mm and 140 mm 20 and 30 of irrigation water in dry years respectively this should be very benefit to relieve the water shortage and allocation conflicts at the watershed scale during the peak water use season above water saving evaluation could be a reference for making water saving practices and increasing water use

10128,rice is the high water consumption crop that feeds more than half of the world population the planting area of cold region rice is expanded rapidly in recent years due to the high market values also resulting in increasing water shortages and eco environmental problems on a regional scale pursuing high benefits and increasing water use efficiency become more significant both for stakeholders and managers to understand the yield variation and water saving potential the specific rice model oryza2000 was adopted to predict the responses of rice growth yield and water use to the various climatic and irrigation conditions in a typical cold region of northeast china field experiments were conducted for the japonica rice in cold regions jrc during 2018 and 2019 with detailed observations on rice growth and development the oryza2000 was calibrated and validated using two year experimental data simulated ponded water depth various organ development and yield fitted well with field observations a set of recommended values of crop parameters for jrc was obtained through the systematic parametrization showing very specific and different characters from the varieties in warmer regions the irrigation scheduling module was modified for adapting to the various irrigation regimes after that the scenario simulation with 30 year different climatic data i e 1990 2019 and three different irrigation regimes i e traditional flood irrigation tfi shallow wet irrigation swi and controlled irrigation cti were conducted using the calibrated model status evaluation and scenario analyses indicated that the crop yield of jrc varied significantly due to relatively large fluctuations of photothermal conditions in different years the inter annual potential yield varied from 6790 to 9516 kg ha 1 with an average of 8210 kg ha 1 evaluation on water saving scenarios indicated that adopting swi and cti regimes could averagely save up to 90 mm and 140 mm 20 and 30 of irrigation water in dry years respectively compared with tfi regime overall the obtained set of parameters for jrc could efficiently complement the parameter database for rice modeling in cold regions meanwhile the yield and water saving evaluation could provide very useful information and the basis for supporting the future jrc production and water saving management keywords rice growth simulation crop model parameters potential yield water saving analysis oryza cold regions 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is a major staple food for the world s population which is cultivated under a range of environments at latitudes ranging from 35 s to 53 n and at elevations reaching to 2000 m yoshida 1981 rice production is essential to the worldwide food security it is also the largest water consumer in agriculture and 75 of the world s rice production is grown with irrigation devkota et al 2013 the indica rice and japonica rice are two widely cultivated rice types the former is mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical areas reaching maturity twice or three times per year the latter is planted in temperate and cold regions with higher latitude with one growing season per year and less sensitive to the low temperature guo et al 2019 in recent years the japonica rice becomes more popular as main food on the table due to its good taste while the indica rice is increasingly processed into rice products particularly the japonica rice in cold regions hereafter called jrc which is mainly concentrated in northeast china north japan and korean peninsula has obviously higher quality price and economic values than that in other regions mao et al 2017 shimono 2011 wang et al 2013 nakajima et al 2017 thus it is very attractive to understand the possible yield variation of jrc under different conditions both for farmers and policy makers during the last decade the planting area of cold region rice has expanded rapidly in northeast china due to the increasing food demand and the high benefits e g with plant area increased from 2 68 million ha in 2000 5 11 million ha in 2018 nbsc 2020 irrigation is critical for rice growth in cold regions where the rainfall is not timely and sufficient enough in normal years the rising irrigation demand exacerbates the water shortages and conflicts for different water users in the watersheds this has caused agricultural drought and grain yield reduction in local regions yang et al 2017 and as well some eco environment problems due to excessive groundwater exploitation and aquifer drawdown liu and liu 2006 zhang et al 2012 various water saving practices wsps are proposed to reduce irrigation water use for jrc on both farm and regional scales particularly with emphasis on field water saving irrigation e g controlled irrigation and shallow wet irrigation wang and zhang 2015 zhao et al 2015 therefore a thorough understanding of water saving potential with different wsps is very necessary and significant for rational water use management and jrc planting in the future rice growth and water consumption are various and affected by genotype environment and management field experiment is the basis to understand these relationships while it is costly laborious and time consuming due to the various and changing conditions ren et al 2016 using the well calibrated validated crop model is an effective way to evaluate the effects of ambient environmental changes on rice production and the coping strategies crop models could simulate the plant biomass or organ development based on the plant physiology or morphology processes yang et al 2004 van ittersum et al 2003 one kind belongs to the generic models that simulate multi processes without regards to crop species which is often fine tuned to describe the phonological and physiological traits of rice e g the application of aquacrop epic and cropsyst maniruzzaman et al 2015 xu et al 2019 sandra et al 2016 confalonieri and bocchi 2005 in contrast another kind of rice specific model has more detailed and accurate description for rice variety attributes and paddy field conditions typically as oryza and ceres rice bouman et al 2001 ritchie et al 1987 hoogenboom et al 2015 researchers have conducted extensive modeling studies on rice in tropical subtropical areas however to our knowledge there are still few studies which focus on the systematical parameterization and simulation of rice growth in cold regions in particular the reference values of crop growth parameters are rarely reported for jrc the objectives of this paper are to 1 conduct a systematical parameterization of growth model and provide the reference parameter values for rice modeling in cold regions 2 assess the yield variation under various climatic years and analyze the main impact factors and 3 evaluate the water saving potential with adopting water saving irrigation regimes the detailed field observation experiments were carried out in the cold region of northeast china the widely used rice model oryza2000 was parameterized and calibrated and then used to evaluate the climatic yields and water saving potential with various climatic years and irrigation regimes the research could provide the significant parameter reference for future modeling work on jrc and very valuable information for improving rice production and water use in cold regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments 2 1 1 location climate soils crop and irrigation field experiments were conducted at qing an irrigation experimental station 46 58 06 n 127 39 37 e in the songnen plain of northeast china in 2018 and 2019 the region where the station located is a typical cold area of china with the mean annual temperature of 2 5 and mean monthly temperature ranging from 30 3 in january to 27 1 in july it has the middle temperate and sub humid continental monsoon climate the average annual precipitation is 635 mm during 1990 2019 with about 75 occurring between june and september the number of frost free days average 130 per year daily meteorological data of sunshine duration maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity and wind speed for 2018 and 2019 were taken from the nearby tieli weather station and were used to compute the fao penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto according to allen et al 1998 the monthly averages of the main weather variables are presented in fig 1 the soil profile at the experimental site has very typical layered soil characteristics of lowland paddy fields the upper layer is a muddy puddled layer with silty loam soils about 25 cm thickness with little resistance to water flow the second interlayer layer is a plow sole about 15 cm thickness with a large resistance to water flow and the deeper layer is the non puddled soils with sandy type texture table 1 lists the main soil physical properties and soil hydraulic parameters of the studied soil experimental site soil samples were collected by a soil auger from surface to 100 cm soil depth for texture analysis the particle size distribution was measured using a laser particle size analyzer malvern ms2000 uk the dry bulk density was obtained by oven drying undisturbed soil samples of 100 cm3 ring sampler for 48 h the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s of each soil layer i e 0 10 cm 10 25 cm and 25 40 cm was measured by using guelph permeameter 2800k1 usa after harvest for soil depth of 40 80 cm k s was estimated using the hypres pedo transfer functions wösten et al 1999 according to the measured percentages of sand silt and clay particles and bulk density the japonica rice variety of suijing 18 was used because it is widely grown in the region with high quality and benefits the crop was sown on april 15th and transplanted on may 16th in both 2018 and 2019 while it was harvested on september 18th and 21st in 2018 and 2019 respectively the planting density was 20 hills per m2 and 5 plants per hill the field conditions could be more representative of the situations of high standard farmland which has uniform and regular field size and could benefit from the realization of fully mechanized operations and efficient irrigation fertilization management compared to lysimeter pit or small plot experiments traditional flood irrigation i e basin irrigation was applied in our experiment other cultivation practices including fertilizer application and pest crop disease and weed control were similar to the practices commonly recommended by agricultural technician in the region 2 1 2 field observation and data field hydrological conditions and crop growth were monitored from planting to harvest during the crop seasons of 2018 and 2019 in particular a detailed observation was carried out for crop growth including monitoring the development of various crop organs the observations related to soils and crops were carried out in three experimental fields with three time replications in each field during 2018 while the similar observations were conducted in one field with three time replications during 2019 considering the labor and time consumption and field planning rearrangement the ponded water depth was measured using a vertical ruler when there was ponding water in the field soil water content was measured by oven drying method at the depth of 0 10 cm 10 25 cm 25 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm during field drying stages irrigation amount in each field was recorded by water meter 100 ml precision which was installed at the inlet of the water supply pipe rainfall was recorded every hour with an automatic rain gauge hobo rg3 m usa during the crop seasons groundwater depth was monitored every an hour with an automatic water level recorder hobo u20 usa buried in an observation well the observed crop data included the various organ development biomass accumulation leaf area index lai and crop yield the complete plant was sampled and separated into different components roots stems green leaves dead leaves and storage organ i e panicles the dry biomass was measured by oven drying at 80 to the constant mass including the dry aboveground green biomass d agb and the dry biomass of stems green leaves dead leaves and panicles i e dwst dwgl dwdl and dwso for lai measurement the leaf length and width were measured for each leaf and the lai was calculated using eq 1 as follows han et al 2009 1 l a i 0 75 ρ 1 3 i 1 3 j 1 n l i j b i j where 0 75 is a shape factor ρ is the plant density which was calculated from the plant spacing n is the leaf number of each plant l is the leaf length and b is the leaf broad crop sampling and observation were taken at three sites within the experimental field about every 10 days during the crop seasons with higher frequency during critical development stages from transplanting to harvesting a total of 9 and 10 samplings were carried out in 2018 and 2019 respectively covering every growth stage dry grain yield was collected at 1 m2 with six replicates during harvest 2 2 model description the oryza2000 and its modification the oryza2000 is a mechanistic and dynamic eco physiological model developed for simulating the rice growth bouman et al 2001 it can simulate the rice growth and yield formation with water limited and nitrogen limited conditions oryza2000 is consisted of different modules of crop growth evapotranspiration soil water balance and nitrogen dynamics it is assumed that the crop is free from disease pests and weeds in oryza2000 the model has been widely used in improving field water nitrogen management and guaranteeing rice production under various environmental conditions artacho et al 2011 yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 more comprehensive theory and description of the model could be found in detail in bouman et al 2001 a brief introduction of model principles related to this paper is given in the following parts 2 2 1 soil water balance there are four different soil water balance modules in oryza2000 and the paddy module is adopted in this study paddy is a one dimensional multi layer up to 10 model that can be used for both puddled and non puddled conditions in irrigated and rainfed environments the water balance of a lowland rice field is calculated as follows 2 δ w δ w s δ h p o n d i r c e t s p d where all units in mm d 1 δw is the change of total stored water δw s and δh pond are the changes of soil water storage and surface ponded water depth respectively i is the irrigation supply r is the rainfall c is the capillary rise from groundwater e is the soil evaporation t is the crop transpiration s is the seepage loss through the lateral ridge p is the vertical percolation and d is the surface drainage runoff bund overflow the calculation of water balance is applied to the surface ponded water layer and each of the layers in the soil profile see detail in bouman et al 2001 the model could simulate all the water balance components and the status of ponded water depth and layered soil moistures at a given time step the irrigation rainfall and capillary rise are the sources to recharge to soil water capillary rise from the groundwater to a soil layer is assumed to occur only if soil water tension is greater than that corresponding to field capacity it is estimated as a function of hydraulic conductivity soil water tension and distance to water table on the basis of the darcy equation the penman monteith method is adopted to calculate eto it is further separated into the radiation term et rd and the aerodynamic term et ae for estimating the potential evaporation rate and transpiration rate e p and t p the actual evaporation rate and transpiration rate e a and t a were finally determined with considering the soil water stress lateral seepage occurring in terraces is estimated based on the darcy equation vertical percolation through plough sole layer is calculated using an iterative newton raphson procedure wolfram 1991 from hydraulic conductivity characteristics soil water potential gradient and soil thickness of the plow sole the water in excess of field capacity is drained out of the layer with a maximum rate equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the layer the ponded water depth exceeding bund height is assumed as runoff after accounting for evapotranspiration and percolation loss in addition the soil moisture characteristics and hydraulic conductivity are described with van genuchten mualem vg m equations van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 2 2 2 crop growth and yield the crop module in oryza2000 is specifically developed for simulating the rice growth and yield formulation this crop model is driven by radiation and accumulated temperature taking good account of photosynthesis respiration and senescence it follows the daily calculation scheme for the rates of dry matter production of the plant organs and the rate of phenological development bouman et al 2001 the dry matter production is simulated on the basis of the balance between daily co2 assimilation and respiration and partitioned among the various plant organs depending on the allocation rates this model could be applied for various rice varieties with given specific parameters the crop development stage dvs is divided into two parts based on accumulated temperature vegetative growth period and reproductive growth period the total daily dry matter increment is partitioned into roots stems leaves and panicles according to the partition coefficient of various development stages the effects of water stress and nitrogen stress on crop growth could be considered when the soil moisture or nitrogen is deficit in the root zone the other factors including maximum minimum temperature and photoperiod may affect the crop development rate and biomass production 2 2 3 irrigation scheduling design in oryza2000 irrigation can be scheduled according to the controlled criteria of irrigation timing and application depth irrigation time can be determined by different trigger conditions including the lower limit options of critical ponded water depth critical soil water tension content or days after the disappearance of ponded water only one kind of trigger conditions can be selected in a simulation however some water saving irrigation regimes e g shallow wet irrigation may require different trigger conditions during different stages thus the module was modified so that the lower limit options could be changed with crop development stages according to user setting the application depth is determined by a user specified value which is kept the same throughout the whole growing season however this value should be dynamic in practice for different stages more importantly the application depth for the kinds of controlled irrigation are almost determined based on the desired ponded water depth after irrigation thus the application depth criteria were modified to be as a function of crop development stages and a new option was added for computing the irrigation application depth irad cm as follows 3 i r a d x t i 1 n δ d i θ s i θ i where n is the number of soil layers above the plow sole layer d is the thickness of i th soil layer cm θ is the actual soil water content cm3 cm 3 θ s is the saturated soil water content cm3 cm 3 t is the time d and x is the user specified value of ponded water depth after irrigation i e the upper limit of ponded water depth cm 2 3 model setup parameterization calibration and validation a soil profile with 80 cm depth which had three horizons according to the observation table 1 was specified during simulations the soil domain was further divided into ten layers in simulation 5 cm thickness for the first five layers 15 cm thickness for the sixth layer i e plough sole layer and 10 cm thickness for the below four layers the simulation period was from late april to late september covering the entire rice growing season initial soil water contents were set up based on the observation value before steeping field i e the initial flooding before transplant all of the balance terms in eq 2 were considered in simulation except the lateral seepage loss through field ridge due to the relatively flat terrain in experimental sites the datasets relative to 2018 and 2019 were used to calibrate and validate the model respectively the calibration was first performed for soil hydrological process and then for crop growth process for the soil hydraulic parameters θ s and k s were set up with the measured values while the initial values of other parameters in vg m equations were estimated using the hypres pedo transfer functions wösten et al 1999 table 1 some initial crop parameters were determined on the basis of the measured values mainly including basic temperature values for development and leaf area growth specific leaf area sla and partition coefficients of dry matter while other parameters were set as default values bouman et al 2001 the irrigation depth and time during the calibration and validation were specified according to the experimental records table 2 the calibration was conducted by a trial and error approach particularly aiming to provide the basic reference values of crop parameters for the cold region rice the calibration is first performed for field hydrological process and then for crop growth process the soil parameters were calibrated based on the observed ponded water depth the crop parameters were calibrated based on the observed biomass of various plant organs i e stems leaves and panicles and lai most crop parameters are universal for all rice cultivars while some are variety specific ones bouman et al 2001 according to the previous studies bouman et al 2001 tan et al 2019 and our field observations the main calibrated crop parameters were basic temperature parameters development rates partition coefficients of dry matter sla leaf death rate drlv table 3 since some soil and crop parameters as shown in tables 1 and 3 were actually measured in field or laboratory with less uncertainty they were only slightly adjusted during calibration table 3 and table a1 the simulated values were then compared with the observed ones through the fitness performance indicator parameter adjustment was repeated until the simulation results can be accepted in both calibration and validation the statistical analysis was conducted for evaluating the goodness of fit between simulated and observed values the mean relative error mre root mean square error rmse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and coefficient of regression b were used to quantify the model fitting performance detailed definitions and equations for the above indicators could be found in xu et al 2013 2 4 using the model for evaluating yield variation and irrigation water saving after proper calibration and validation the model was applied to predict the responses of rice growth yield and water use to the various climatic and irrigation conditions in scenarios the simulation was carried out for 30 years from 1990 to 2019 in order to assess the yield variation under different climatic conditions meanwhile three different irrigation regimes were adopted for assessing the water saving potential involving traditional flood irrigation tfi shallow wet irrigation swi and controlled irrigation cti the detailed controlled criteria for above irrigation regimes are presented in table 4 the swi and cti corresponded to the water saving irrigation regimes which were proposed and recommended by the local irrigation research institute lv et al 2012 the variation of rice yield during 1990 2019 was analyzed for understanding the yield potential and the adaptability of different irrigation regimes the potential yield which is defined here as the possible yield only limited by climatic factors mainly radiation and temperature could be almost obtained under tfi regimes due to no water stress with ponding conditions in addition the crop water productivity wpet kg m 3 and field water productivity wpnet kg m 3 were calculated and used to assess the water use efficiency they were defined as the grain yield divided by the actual crop evapotranspiration and by the net field water use i r d respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation results showed that the model performed well in simulating the fluctuations of ponded water depth pwd and the crop growth and yield for jrc during the calibration with 2018 data fig 2a 3a and b and table 5 the calibrated parameters related to soil hydraulic properties and crop growth are provided in tables 1 and 4 the simulated pwds were in an agreement with the observed ones fig 2a producing a mre 0 8 a rmse 1 7 cm and a nse 0 5 table 5 the simulated values for the various dry biomass i e d agb dwst dwgl and dwso and lai satisfactorily matched with the measured values fig 3ab for d agb the mre and rmse were respectively 17 9 and 638 kg ha 1 with nse reaching to 0 98 for the dwst dwgl and dwso relative to different organs the mre and rmse ranged from 22 9 0 9 and from 188 kg ha 1 to 526 kg ha 1 respectively and the nse values were between 0 86 and 0 96 table 5 the mre rmse and nse values for lai were 5 4 0 25 m2 m 2 and 0 96 respectively the simulated crop yield in 2018 was 8074 kg ha 1 which was slightly higher than the observed one 7604 738 kg ha 1 some discrepancies may be related to the destructive crop sampling which could not reflect the real continuous growth of a rice plant fig 3 all calibrated soil and crop parameters were directly used as model inputs during validation results showed that the goodness of fit indicators for pwd were also satisfactory between the simulated and observed values mre 0 7 rmse 1 3 cm nse 0 59 observations of d agb and dry organ biomass were well reproduced by the calibrated model fig 3c and table 5 the simulation produced small error rmse 584 kg ha 1 and high modeling efficiency nse 0 98 for d agb for the dwst dwgl and dwso the rmse values were between 185 and 425 kg ha 1 and the nse values were greater than 0 89 the dynamics of lai were reasonably captured by the model as well fig 3d with rmse 0 3 m2 m 2 and nse 0 95 the mre values for d agb dwst and dwgl were relatively large table 5 due to the very small observed values in initial period actually the mre would be less than 25 if the initial two observed values were not considered overall results indicated an acceptably good simulation of the crop growth process the simulated crop yield 7005 kg ha 1 was also close to the observed one 7081 566 kg ha 1 the general agreement between the simulated and measured data both calibration and validation indicated that the model performance was generally good after a detailed parameterization the calibrated model could be considered a valuable tool to evaluate field water use and crop growth yield for jrc 3 2 parameterization for jrc the values of primary crop parameters for jrc are provided in table 3 with comparison to the default values mainly for tropical subtropical rice results indicated that many crop parameters of jrc were specific and different from those of rice in warmer regions the base temperature and optimum temperature for jrc were 8 and 30 respectively which was found similar to the values for tropical subtropical rice however the lower air temperature threshold coldmin should be 8 for jrc and was obviously lower than the default value 12 this is because the jrc variety was more resistant to cold temperatures note that the phenological development parameters of jrc were quite distinctive jrc had longer growing period 130 140 days and lower development rates during various phases e g dvrj dvri dvrr and dvrp in table 3 with the lower ambient temperature the maximum relative growth rate of leaf area rgrlmx 0 0088 d 1 was relatively higher than the default value 0 0085 d 1 in tropical areas as the default value may underestimate the leaf growth in addition the fraction of photosynthetically active sunlight energy frpar that was a sensitive parameter was calibrated to be 0 45 less than the default value 0 5 this should be attributed to the lower plant density higher latitude and leaf morphology for jrc yan et al 2019 zhu et al 2010 rocha et al 2021 the dry matter partitioning coefficients of leaves stems and panicles i e flv fst and fso and the sla were obtained from measurement data and slightly adjusted during calibration table 3 these values of jrc were significantly different from the default values for example the flv was equal to 0 5 at dvs 0 5 and lower than default value of 0 6 fst was adjusted to 0 5 and 0 6 at dvs of 0 5 and 0 75 respectively the stem of jrc grew faster than tropical rice at first and then slower but with longer growth period the panicles of jrc appeared earlier but grew more slowly than the tropical rice and thus the fso was set as 0 1 and 0 4 at dvs of 0 75 and 1 0 respectively the sla was very important parameter affecting the lai changes and estimated based on the observed data and slightly adjusted in our study table 3 presented its variable values in different stages which showed significant differences between our values and the default values more other parameters affected by the difference of variety characteristic or field management are supplemented in the appendix table a1 above parameterization of crop parameters could be very meaningful to the future modeling work related to japonica rice in cold regions 3 3 water use performance and rice growth during the experimental years the dynamics of main water balance terms during the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 are presented in fig 2 the two years had relatively wet climate during the growing season the rainfall amount was 655 8 mm and 804 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively with rainfall frequency of 20 and 5 based on the amounts of annual precipitation during the crop growth period however the rainfall was often unevenly distributed in time mainly occurring in summer rainy season but with less amount in spring season like 2019 this led to a spring drought and more irrigation requirement about 120 mm in 2018 compared to the very wet year 2019 table 2 and fig 2 after june the rainfall was very plentiful and irrigation was almost not needed in wet years drainage became a major issue for avoiding waterlogging especially after the continuous heavy rainfall in the summer therefore the amount of irrigation including for steeping field was 407 7 mm and 289 6 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively while drainage amount was about 231 2 mm and 247 6 mm the irrigation for jrc was mainly concentrated in the seeding and tillering stages and the difference of irrigation amount was related to the distribution of rainfall in the spring season the actual evaporation and transpiration were 246 6 mm and 270 7 mm in 2018 respectively similar to those in 2019 263 1 mm and 245 1 mm the fraction of e a to et a could be about 0 5 which was higher than the reported values of tropical subtropical rice about 0 18 0 41 jensen and rahman 1987 belder et al 2005 because the leaf coverage effects were weaker for jrc due to the slower growth rates the evapotranspiration of whole growth period for jrc about 520 mm was lower than that in warmer and rainy regions about 550 800 mm alberto et al 2011 zhang 1964 mao et al 1994 the evapotranspiration rate was about 4 2 mm d 1 which was lower than the tropical area such as india 4 9 mm d 1 and thailand 7 4 mm d 1 jensen and rahman 1987 tyagi et al 2000 the percolation through plow sole can reach to 159 9 mm and 187 9 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively this was mainly resulted from the differences of pwd fluctuations between 2018 and 2019 fig 2 due to the presence of the plow sole the effect of capillary rise from groundwater was very weak with total amount less than 1 mm in both two years although there was no significant difference in evaporation and transpiration for 2018 and 2019 the yields were different between the two years crop yield was largely affected by temperature and radiation conditions the radiation and average temperature in july and august of 2018 were higher than that of 2019 fig 1 resulting in about 7 higher of crop yield in 2018 3 4 scenario analysis for yield variation and water saving 3 4 1 responses of yield and water productivity to climatic conditions the 30 year prediction indicated that the inter annual potential yield of jrc ranged from 6790 to 9516 kg ha 1 with an average of 8210 kg ha 1 it varied significantly due to the relatively large fluctuations of photothermal conditions in cold regions compared with tropical subtropical regions fig 4 the potential yield can reach to around 8550 kg ha 1 in high radiation years e g 2001 2002 and 2017 for normal radiation years crop yield ranged from about 7900 kg ha 1to 8600 kg ha 1 e g 1991 1996 and 2000 potential yield was only 7500 7700 kg ha 1 during low radiation years in addition crop yield of jrc was also more significantly affected by the uneven distribution of radiation compared with warmer regions for example the total seasonal radiation of 2017 was similar to 2019 but the potential yield of 2017 8554 kg ha 1 was much higher than that of 2019 6837 kg ha 1 due to more radiation distributed in the critical stages for yield formation i e from late june to early september correspondingly the wpet ranged from about 1 2 kg m 3 to 1 9 kg m 3 averaging at 1 6 kg m 3 in 30 year simulation fig 5 the wpet of jrc was obviously higher than the most reported values of field rice in tropical subtropical regions the wpnet varied between 0 8 and 1 5 kg m 3 with an average of 1 1 kg m 3 moreover results showed that the crop yield with swi and cti regimes was close to the potential one however there was a slightly reductions 3 in very dry years e g 2007 2008 and 2010 due to the water stress occurring in the naturally drying period meanwhile swi and cti had the higher field water use efficiency than tfi fig 5 overall the above understanding of yield variation may provide very useful information in planting planning and policy making for farmers stakeholders or managers 3 4 2 potential for water saving irrigation tfi with the lowest cost was the highest water consuming regime for the 30 year scenario simulation the average irrigation depth of swi and cti was 293 mm and 266 mm respectively less than that of tfi 365 mm this meant that about 70 mm and 100 mm of irrigation water could be saved compared to tfi fig 6 in wet years e g 1998 2014 and 2019 the irrigation depth for tfi swi and cti was about 260 mm 195 mm and 203 mm respectively swi and cti could reduce 25 and 22 of irrigation water use compared to tfi irrigation was mainly applied in the early crop growing period especially for the year with less rainfall in spring season irrigation was almost not required in the middle and late growth period due to the sufficient rainfall in wet years for normal years e g in 2000 2005 and 2006 the irrigation depth of tfi averagely increased to 367 mm meanwhile that of swi and cti was 294 mm and 280 mm respectively saving 20 and 24 of irrigation water compared with tfi supplementary irrigation was also needed in the reproductive period for normal years due to the insufficient rainfall in the summer season compared to wet years in dry years e g in 2001 2004 and 2007 the irrigation depth was much larger and its average value reached to about 473 mm 379 mm and 333 mm for tfi swi and cti respectively swi and cti could save 20 and 30 i e 90 mm and 140 mm of irrigation water compared to tfi scenario analyses indicated that adopting swi and cti regimes could significantly reduce the irrigation water demand especially during the peak period of water use in spring season this should be very benefit to relieve the water shortage and allocation conflicts on a watershed scale particularly in dry years actually the real implementation of water saving regimes was dependent on the modernized irrigation systems e g the efficient water delivery and service system and the high standard farmland this required a large amount of investment both from the government and stakeholders and also a balance between water saving and cost thus our water saving evaluation could provide a significant basis support for making water saving practices and allocating water resources 4 conclusion the specific rice model oryza2000 was calibrated and validated for japonica rice in cold regions jrc of northeast china with using detailed field experimental data of 2018 and 2019 respectively the calibrated model could well simulate the fluctuations of ponded water depth various organ development and yield formation a set of completed crop parameter values were determined for jrc through combining the detailed observations and model parameterization results indicated that many crop parameters of jrc were quite specific especially for those related to the phenological development organ biomass partition temperature and radiation utilization our recommended sets of parameters could complement the parameter database for rice modeling in cold regions scenario prediction was carried out with 30 year different climatic data of 1990 2019 and three irrigation regimes of traditional flood irrigation tfi shallow wet irrigation swi and controlled irrigation cti status performance and scenario simulation indicated that the crop yield of jrc varied very significantly due to the large fluctuations of photothermal conditions the inter annual potential crop yield i e with tfi could range from 6790 to 9516 kg ha 1 with an average of 8210 kg ha 1 besides crop yield was also more noticeably affected by the uneven distribution of radiation during the growing season in the cold regions compared with warmer regions the wpet of jrc was higher than the most reported values of field rice in tropical subtropical regions varying between 1 2 and 1 8 kg m 3 under no water stress conditions above understanding of crop yield responses may provide very useful information in planting planning and policy making for farmers and managers simulation analysis on water saving potential indicated that the irrigation for jrc was mainly concentrated in seeding and tillering stages during the spring season after june the rainfall was relatively plentiful and the inter annual difference of irrigation amount was mainly caused by rainfall distribution in the drier spring season compared to tfi swi and cti could averagely save about 70 mm and 90 mm 20 and 24 of irrigation water in normal years respectively meanwhile they could save about 90 mm and 140 mm 20 and 30 of irrigation water in dry years respectively this should be very benefit to relieve the water shortage and allocation conflicts at the watershed scale during the peak water use season above water saving evaluation could be a reference for making water saving practices and increasing water use

10129,mulched drip irrigation using saline water has the potential to alleviate pressure on crop production from limited freshwater resources in arid and semi arid regions to explore the potential of saline water irrigation it is necessary to investigate how salt stress caused by saline water irrigation affects soil physico chemical properties and the physiology and growth of crops the effects of salt stress caused by saline water irrigation are complex and to date they are not well understood we aimed to analyse the distribution and dynamics of these properties to assess their effects on cotton growth yield and water productivity during a two year field experiment using saline water irrigation with various salinity levels 1 3 6 9 and 12 g l 1 cotton yield water productivity and their related components were significantly affected by the different salinity levels 1 irrigation water derived salt accumulated in the soil especially in the surface soil layer 0 20 cm but not in the 60 80 cm layer it was possible to rank cotton main root length based on salinity level as follows 3 1 6 9 12 g l 1 2 during the growth stage plants in the 3 g l 1 salinity treatment had transpiration rates 10 30 higher net photosynthetic rates 20 40 higher and yields 25 55 higher than those in the other treatments 3 the 3 g l 1 salinity treatment provided the optimal watering conditions for cotton and plants in this treatment displayed no salt stress symptoms in terms of their physiology or growth therefore this salinity level is suitable for the mulched drip irrigation of cotton using saline water our research provides guidance for further exploitation and utilisation of brackish and saline water resources and sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in semi arid and arid areas

et al 2012 wang et al 2014 ning et al 2015 xinjiang is located in the hinterlands of northwest china and has a typical dry continental climate yang et al 2020a this area is suitable for cotton growth as the growing conditions are optimal for high dry matter accumulation and high quality long fibre growth the xinjiang cotton production area constitutes 30 of the total global area devoted to cotton and it produces 75 of the chinese cotton output in the past few decades mulched drip irrigation which can increase soil moisture and prevent soil secondary salinisation has been widely implemented in cotton cultivation in xinjiang to combat drought and water shortages an underground saline water resource in this region is gradually starting to be used to meet the increasing irrigation demands shen

respiration by roots and accumulation of toxic substances bouksila et al 2013 the correct balance of salt and water in the soil is central to successful crop growth increasing salt stress causes membrane lipid peroxidation protein oxidation and other damage to lipids proteins and nucleic acids leading to abnormal plant metabolism initial chlorophyll fluorescence is also reduced as are the maximum photochemical efficiency and maximum net photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2006 pang et al 2010 excess salt affects root water absorption photosynthesis and transpiration this leads to growth inhibition of roots stems leaves and other organs and reduces dry matter production ultimately leading to a reduction in crop yield parida et al 2005 stomata are the main channels for the exchange of co2 and o2 and the escape of water vapour from leaves maas and hoffman 1977 wu et al 2014 they use variable opening to regulate these transport processes thereby controlling leaf photosynthetic and transpiration rates guo et al 2005 rahman et al 2015 zhang et al 2006 the photosynthetic rate affects the roots stems leaves fruits and other plant organs and is therefore related to crop yield transpiration inevitably leads to water loss affecting crop photosynthesis and its rate has an important effect on available water resources and agricultural water utilisation efficiency yang et al 2015 ghaderi et al 2012 kang et al 2012 singh et al 2010 cotton can adapt to drought to a certain degree pettigrew 2004 however when under salt stress cotton growth is inhibited and plant height gain is significantly slowed this results in shorter plants grown under full irrigation liu et al 2012 salt stress can also affect the morphology and distribution of root growth and affect the ability of roots to absorb water and nutrients salt stress at the seedling stage promotes the growth of the main root and increases the number of lateral roots yazar et al 2002 moreover salt stress can inhibit the production of bolls and promote boll abscission resulting in reduced cotton yields on the one hand using saline water for agricultural irrigation can provide the necessary amount of water for crop growth but on the other hand saline water increases the accumulation of salt in the soil which negatively affects soil conditions and crop yield chen et al 2010 however many factors remain unclear such as 1 what is the appropriate irrigation water salinity level for cotton that ensures optimal yield and water productivity wp under saline water mulched drip irrigation and 2 what are the effects of different irrigation salinity levels on soil physico chemical properties and cotton physiological and biochemical processes and growth indices including the main root length leaf area index and dry mass accumulation to answer these questions we conducted a two year growing season field experiment to evaluate saline water utilisation by cotton under mulched drip irrigation the main objectives of this study were to 1 assess the effect of different water salinity levels applied via mulched drip irrigation on the soil salinity balance within the root zone 2 measure the effects of different water salinity levels on cotton growth physiological and biochemical processes yield and wp and 3 to determine the most suitable yield compatible salinity level for mulched drip irrigation using saline water to guide the sustainable development of future irrigation schemes and water resource utilisation planning for cotton production within semi arid and arid regions 2 material and methods 2 1

significant differences between the salinity treatments at p 0 05 the figures were created using originpro 2020b originlab usa 3 results 3 1 soil ph variations in soil ph under different salinity treatments are shown in fig 3 the soil ph followed a curved pattern across the entire growth period culminating in a single peak at the flowering stage in 2018 in general the soil ph increased with increasing salinity however the average ph was higher in treatment a than in treatments b c or d by 4 2 2 5 and 2 5 respectively the average ph in treatment a was lower than that in treatment e by 0 8 but there was no significant difference between a and e 3 2 soil moisture and ec the vertical distribution of soil moisture in the different soil layers under each treatment during 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 4 soil moisture fluctuated within the 0 100 cm soil layer in the 0 20 cm layer the observed soil moisture was 5 15 this large range may be a result of precipitation and the associated intense evaporation that follows soil moisture was high in the 20 80 cm layer in which the cotton root system is mainly distributed water consumption by cotton was high and the resulting change in soil moisture was clear in the 80 100 cm layer soil moisture levels were at their lowest for the duration of the experiment the soil moisture levels in the different salinity treatments were ordered as follows e d c b a root water absorption was restricted in the higher salinity 6 g l 1 treatments while plants in the lower salinity treatments a and b had improved root water absorption fig 5 shows the distribution of soil ec at different soil depths soil salinity increased slightly during the growth period particularly in the 0 20 cm surface soil layer however a reduction in salinity was observed in the 60 80 cm soil layer the soil ec range within the different treatments was 0 30 2 38 ms cm 1 with most values close to or greater than 1 5 ms cm 1 during the squaring stage in 2018 the experimental plots were first irrigated with saline water and the ec values measured at this stage were assigned as the ec background values representing long term mulched drip irrigation with fresh water as the growth period progressed the soil ec of each treatment was found to develop into a single peaked curve soil ec levels also varied with depth in the 0 100 cm sampling zone the maximum values of all treatments a b c d and e were observed in the 0 20 cm layer during the boll opening stage in 2018 1 30 1 72 2 01 and 2 10 ms cm 1 respectively the minimum ec values occurred in the 60 80 cm layer during the flowering stage in 2018 0 53 0 38 0 72 0 71 and 0 34 ms cm 1 respectively 3 3 soil hydro chemical characteristics piper diagrams were used to illustrate the hydro chemical species observed in the soil samples from the different salinity treatments in 2018 and 2019 fig 6 in all treatments in both years the ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl and hco3 concentrations were higher than those of the other ions measured the two main cations accounted for 50 80 of the milligram equivalent and the three anions accounted for 80 100 from 2018 2019 the main hydro chemical species in treatment a evolved from so4 2 ca2 to so4 2 mg2 ca2 similarly in treatment b so4 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 evolved into so4 2 ca2 mg2 in treatment c so4 2 ca2 evolved to so4 2 cl ca2 mg2 in treatment d so4 2 ca2 mg2 evolved into so4 2 cl ca2 mg2 na finally in treatment e so4 2 cl ca2 k evolved into so4 2 ca2 mg2 as salinity increased the milligram equivalent of anions gradually evolved from ca2 to mg2 and na and the cations gradually evolved from so4 2 to cl this was the main reason that the soil water hydro chemical species evolved from so4 2 ca2 to so4 2 cl ca2 mg2 na 3 4 net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate the pn of cotton varied throughout the 2018 growth period and followed a double peaked curve which reached its highest points during the flowering and bolling stages however in 2019 the pn followed a

and intercellular co2 concentration gs and ci greatly affect photosynthesis in cotton leaves gs tends to decrease with increasing water salinity the gs values of the plants in treatment b were higher than those of any other treatments across all growth stages fig 8 the gs of cotton plants was significantly affected by the different salinity levels in the treatments during the flowering stage compared to the gs values in treatment b those in treatments a c d and e decreased by 6 1 38 5 46 2 and 51 9 respectively in 2018 and by 9 1 47 0 52 0 and 58 2 respectively in 2019 the ci increased with increasing water salinity and the levels in each treatment followed the shape of a single peaked curve throughout the two growing seasons these curves reached their maximum points during the bolling stage fig 8 during the bolling stage the ci values in treatment b were 27 5 and 21 2 high than those in treatment a in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared to the ci values in treatment b those

salinity in all growth stages fig 9 following irrigation with saline water the fo of the plants in each treatment increased throughout the experiment the fo values of the plants in treatment e were higher than those in all the other treatments at each growth stage however regarding fm a contrasting result was observed fm decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity the fm values of the plants in treatment e were the lowest of all the treatments at each growth stage and they reached their minimum values during the boll opening stage throughout the growth stage in 2018 the fo values of the plants in treatments b c d and e were 2 3 5 1 10 1 and 13 8 higher respectively than that in treatment a and they were 1 6 5 2 14 4 and 19 3 higher in 2019 in 2018 the fm values of the plants in treatments b c d and e were 7 2 15 9 23 9 and 27 7 lower than that in treatment a respectively and they were 12 3 18 1 27 1 and 40 5 lower in 2019 the potential photosynthetic activity fv fo and maximum photosynthetic efficiency fv fm of ps ii both decreased as irrigation water salinity increased fig 10 throughout the growth stage in 2018 the fv fo values of the plants in treatments b c d and e were 3 4 8 0 9 4 and 19 3 lower respectively than that in treatment a and they were 5 4 8 1 14 7 and 22 8 lower in 2019 the fv fm values of the plants in treatments b c d and e were 6 6 19 4 26 2 and 41 4 lower than that in treatment a in 2018 respectively and they were 5 9 19 4 26 2 and 41 4 lower in 2019 3 7 cotton growth index the largest main root length and lai were both significantly affected by the different salinity treatments both indices were highest in plants grown in treatment b compared to those in the other treatments throughout the two year field experiment fig 11 in addition both indices were lower in plants from treatment e than in plants from any of the other treatments fig 11 the main root system lengths of the plants in treatment b were 45 3 and 10 6 longer than those in treatment a in 2018 and 2019 respectively the lai values of the plants in treatment b were also 1 2 and 29 2 higher in 2018 and 2019 respectively than those in treatment a in 2018 the main root lengths of the plants in treatments c d and e were 25 8 44 1 and 53 8 shorter respectively than those of the plants in treatment b and they were 15 1 23 3 and 30 1 shorter in 2019 in a similar comparison the lai values were 25 2 32 9 and 65 1 shorter in 2018 respectively and they were 39 7 68 2 and 69 6 shorter in 2019 respectively of all the treatments the dry matter production of roots stems and leaves were highest in the plants from treatment b in both years fig 12 the root dry matter production of the plants in treatment b was 10 1 and 12 7 higher than that of the plants in treatment a in 2018 and 2019 respectively comparing the same two treatments stem dry matter was 5 8 and 22 9 higher in 2018 and 2019 respectively and leaf dry matter was 1 7 and 3 2 higher in 2018 and 2019 respectively in 2018 the root dry matter production of the plants in treatments c d and e was 13 8 15 2 and 24 7 lower respectively than that of the plants in treatment b and they were 17 8 20 9 and 24 2 lower respectively in 2019 stem dry matter production in the same comparison of treatments c d and e vs b was 21 28 6 and 47 3 lower respectively in 2018 and 19 8 29 3 and 41 3 lower respectively in 2019 leaf dry matter production when comparing the same treatments was 10 5 25 7 and 9 0 lower respectively in 2018 and 9 5 22 4 and 26 3 lower respectively in 2019 3 8 cotton yield and wp cotton yield and wp were significantly affected by the different salinity treatments in both years fig 13 both indices decreased with increasing salinity yield and wp were higher in the plants grown in treatments a b and c than in those grown in the other treatments when the salinity level was greater than 6 g l 1 yield and wp were significantly negatively affected when the cotton plants were exposed to salinity levels between 1 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 yield and wp greatly increased the yields of treatment b were 13 1 and 24 1 higher than those of treatment a in 2018 and 2019 respectively using the optimal irrigation water salinity level may therefore improve cotton yield finally in 2018 the yields in treatments c d and e were 17 8 38 0 and 55 6 lower respectively than that in treatment b and they were 25 1 43 5 and 60 lower respectively in 2019 the wp of the cotton grown in treatment b was the highest across all treatments and it was 12 5 and 24 higher than that in treatment a in 2018 and 2019 respectively given that the plants were irrigated with saline water in 2018 treatments c d and e used 17 5 38 1 and 55 6 less water respectively than the plants in treatment b and they used 25 1 43 1 and 58 7 less water respectively in 2019 4 discussion 4 1 effect of water salinity on the soil salinity balance in the root zone area saline water irrigation causes salt leaching and the accumulation of salts in the soil when the leaching process is dominant irrigation with saline water can be carried out without significant negative effects when there is significant salt accumulation saline water irrigation systems need to be supplemented with freshwater alternatively during periods of high evaporation the irrigation quantity needs to be increased to wash the salt away from the root zone a correlation matrix between soil moisture and soil salinity at different soil depths is shown in fig 14 the correlation between soil moisture and ec gradually decreased with increasing soil depth soil moisture content increases with increasing salinity in the middle and later periods of cotton growth liu et al 2016 salt that infiltrates the soil via mulched drip irrigation reduces soil water potential causing salt stress in the cotton root system and affecting soil moisture absorption and utilisation chen et al 2010 in our study soil ec was strongly affected by the irrigation water salinity levels used in the treatments the salt content of the surface soil 0 20 cm is directly affected by irrigation and evaporation as both leaching and salt accumulation are significant in this zone when we compared the salt content of the soils at different depths we found that the surface layer contained the highest amount of salt across all the different salinity treatments salt accumulates in the surface layer of soil in response to high surface temperatures low vegetation coverage and high evaporation rates in addition owing to the concurrent action of water uptake by the cotton roots and capillary force saline water can be transported from lower soil depths to the surface soil layer liu et al 2012 this can also determine the salt levels in the surface soil layer this may explain why the salt levels in the surface soil layers were greater than those of the deeper soil layers under all the different salinity treatments in our study the 20 60 cm zone is where the cotton roots are located and the mulched drip irrigation wetting zone causes salt to leach out of the crop cultivation layer these factors can have a significant effect on salt distribution in the soil under mulched drip irrigation we found that soil salt levels were generally highest in the periphery below 60 cm of the wetted zone removal of the salts that have accumulated in this wetting zone front would be required in the long term to maintain production levels although soil salt levels increased significantly in the first year of treatments with salinity levels from 1 to 3 g l 1 they then stabilised and remained stable during the second year similar results were obtained by li et al 2016 2017 in another type of saline soil therefore from the perspective of soil water salt movement it is feasible to use water with salt concentrations of 3 g l 1 for the irrigation of cotton in arid and semi arid regions as it is unlikely to result in secondary salinisation of the soil 4 2 effect of water salinity on root zone soil hydro chemical characteristics effectively controlling or reducing the accumulation of soil salts by accelerating the discharge of harmful ions from the soil layer is an important step towards the safe use of saline water in farmland irrigation the salts dissolved in irrigation water disperse as ions each affecting soil conditions and cotton growth in a different way the effects of the different salinity treatments were mainly related to changes in eight ions and the hydro chemical characteristics of the soil solution zhang et al 2006 following saline water irrigation the composition of the saline ions in the soil changed harmful ions such as na and cl increased while k and ca2 decreased in this study the levels of k na ca2 so4 2 and cl were highest in the 0 20 cm soil layer in each treatment when the salinity level was less than or equal to 6 g l 1 the surface soil s salt levels were in equilibrium the so4 2 content varied widely across the salinity range and it was the most prevalent ion throughout the cotton growth period the higher the salinity the higher the ca2 k na so4 2 and cl content in the soil brackish or saline water irrigation causes the salt in the soil to migrate with the irrigation water and salt ions are carried into the soil body guo et al 2005 in our study salt accumulation increased with increasing irrigation water salinity i e the higher the irrigation water salt content the greater the salt accumulation and ion content in the soil soil ion migration differs depending on the type of salt ion considered single valence ions such as na cl k and hco3 are not easily adsorbed onto soil colloids and these ions tend to move with soil water accumulating where the water slows double valence ions such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 and co3 2 are more easily adsorbed onto soil particles so they accumulate in the wetted soil body and are evenly distributed through the soil profile in this study a small amount of salt accumulation occurred at depths below 60 cm piper diagrams use the milligram equivalent percentage of the main cations na k ca2 and mg2 and anions cl so4 2 and hco3 co3 2 in each litre of water to illustrate the chemical characteristics of the hydrological system in the soil ray and mukherjee 2008 combined with the hydrogeological conditions of an area they can be used to analyse the evolution of its groundwater chemistry chadha 1999 in our study the main cation type at the outset was ca2 at a milligram equivalent percentage of 50 80 and the main anion types were so4 2 cl and hco3 at 80 100 at high irrigation salinities the soil hydro chemical characteristics in the root zone changed from so4 2 and hco3 to cl and fromca2 to mg2 and k 4 3 effect of water salinity on physiological and biochemical processes in cotton salts had both general and specific effects on cotton growth that directly affected crop yields although cotton is relatively salt tolerant high soil salinity levels affect its growth and development ahmed et al 2012 saline water irrigation reduces the water potential of the soil solution thus causing soil root leaf osmotic stress which causes water absorption problems in the plant roots fig 15 these effects induce a series of physiological and biochemical changes in cotton under salt stress niu et al 2010 including partial stomatal closure and a reductions in stomatal conductance and the transpiration rate of leaves affecting growth photosynthesis and co2 balance these changes ultimately affect dry matter accumulation and yield koyro et al 2008 canopy photosynthesis can provide 90 95 of total dry matter production ludlow 1985 we found that saltwater irrigation can cause salt stress which can reduce the pn tr and gs of cotton analysing the causes showed that salt stress caused by saltwater irrigation increased the osmotic potential of the soil solution reduced the effectiveness of soil water use damaged the cytoplasmic membranes of cotton roots increased the water potential gradient of cotton leaves caused cellular osmotic stress hindered the absorption of nutrients and water decreased stomatal opening on cotton leaf surfaces and decreased the rate of co2 entering the mesophyll cells this all leads to a decrease in photosynthesis at higher irrigation water salinity levels the ci of the cotton increased moreover salt stress also leads to leaf stomatal contraction which limits the absorption of atmospheric co2 by the leaves and leads to insufficient photosynthesis this may have resulted in the observed reduction in cotton yield analysing the causes showed that the accumulated salt ions absorbed from the soil by the cotton plants destruction of chloroplast structures and the decrease in mesophyll cells photosynthetic activity led to higher ci values this indicates that the pn tr and gs of cotton are limited by ci our results showed that the fm fv fo and fv fm of cotton decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity with an increase in salt stress the concentrations of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide hydroxyl groups oh hydrogen peroxide h2o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and other non free radicals increase this causes membrane lipid peroxidation protein oxidation and damage to lipids proteins and nucleic acid which all contribute to abnormal metabolism functioning this in turn results in reductions in the initial chlorophyll fluorescence maximum photochemical efficiency photochemical quenching coefficient apparent quantum efficiency light compensation and saturation points electron transfer rate maximum net photosynthetic rate and dark respiration rate in summary it is likely that the salt stress in our study led to a reduction in cotton photosynthesis when the dark reaction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain was impaired photosynthesis between photosystem ii and i was undermined and co2 assimilation was limited 4 4 effect of water salinity on cotton growth processes it has been found that 85 of the cotton root system is distributed in the 30 50 cm soil layer under mulched drip irrigation yang et al 2017b cotton root growth is extremely sensitive to variations in soil conditions the presence of salt in the root zone can have a major effect on growth this is the largest problem facing cotton growers who depend on irrigation cotton root systems grow better in irrigation systems when there is a high soil moisture content and low soil salinity cotton roots first absorb soil water through their deep roots which have a high water potential therefore most of the water initially taken up by the roots is from a less saline soil depth however as more water is removed the total water stress increases to a level equal to that in the lower depths after this water is also absorbed from the shallower more saline soil layers and the effect of salinity on cotton growth is magnified in this study the main root length and dry matter production were highest in plants grown in the 3 g l 1 salinity treatment a good root system increases water and nutrient uptake and consequently improves cotton yield and wp feng et al 2017 the leaf is an important vegetative organ in cotton as in many plants as it is the key site of photosynthesis landivar et al 1983 in our study the effect of salt stress on cotton growth was indicated by changes in leaf growth lai values measured over time reflected changes in leaf area within the experimental plant populations lai is also indicative in terms of several important parameters including photosynthesis transpiration and biomass formation sinclair and horie 1989 the amount of salt in the soil affects plant biomass and the distribution of the root system with increasing soil salt levels the growth of cotton roots becomes seriously inhibited and the yield is reduced miura and tada 2014 our results show that a salinity level of more than 6 g l 1 inhibited the expansion of cotton leaf cover leading to a decrease in the lai and leaf dry mass higher salinities caused slower growth and lower roots stems and leaf qualities as well as lower lais and yields the accumulation of cotton biomass is the basis for obtaining high yield and high quality cotton cotton has a high salt tolerance and soil salt may increase the dry matter accumulation of cotton within a range suitable for cotton growth with increasing irrigation frequency we found that the soil salt content also gradually increased the treatment which induced only slight salt stress in the cotton plants had little effect on dry matter accumulation per cotton plant whereas the severe treatment strongly inhibited it optimal levels of saline water irrigation are favourable to the development of cotton root systems under mulched drip irrigation as it causes the dry matter accumulation and wp to increase water salinity levels of 3 g l 1 may significantly increase the accumulation of dry matter in cotton and promote the transfer of nutrients from the vegetative organs to the reproductive organs we found that when the water salinity level was greater than or equal to 6 g l 1 the accumulation of dry matter greatly inhibited nutrient transfer the question of how to compensate for this effect to create optimal conditions for crop roots to absorb water when the soil osmotic potential has been reduced by saline water irrigation remains unanswered and requires significant future research fig 15 4 5 effect of water salinity on cotton yield and wp generally the water potential of soil of any given texture depends on its moisture and salt levels at any fixed drip irrigation input rate the more saline the irrigation water the more salt ions are carried into the soil body and the lower the soil water potential and osmotic effects this inhibits plant water absorption and causes a chemical drought where crops wither owing to water shortage despite the soil remaining moist fig 15 rengasamy 2010 in contrast water salinity has a greater effect on water consumption by cotton and wp strongly affects total water consumption sinclair et al 1984 our research has shown that wp was significantly compromised when the water salinity was greater than 9 g l 1 however we also found that the wp improved as the salinity levels increased from 1 to 6 g l 1 the main reasons for this were that cotton stops growing during the bolling stage and that the water consumption of cotton mainly depends on the evaporation intensity at ground level and the total amount of water contained in the soil when mulched drip irrigation with highly saline water is used there are more salts in the soil and it has a lower water potential which makes it difficult for the cotton roots to absorb water saline water always contains high concentration of trace elements zn b which may be conducive to cotton growth because the cooperation and antagonism between trace elements and salt can lessen salt damage chen et al 2017 2018 cotton yield was significantly influenced by the salinity levels of the irrigation water in addition the high concentrations of salt in the irrigation water inhibited cotton growth the long term use of brackish and saline water irrigation causes a dramatic decrease in cotton yield when irrigated with saline water the cotton yields in treatments c d and e were substaintially lower than those in treatments a and b this indicates that low concentrations of saline water may reduce salt accumulation thereby reducing salt stress in the root zone 4 6 utilisation of saline water for agricultural irrigation in semi arid and arid regions ocean covers approximately 71 of the globe saline water constitutes 97 5 of all water resources with only 2 5 being freshwater agricultural practices consume a large portion of these freshwater resources and global agricultural irrigation is still dependent on freshwater while most brackish and saline water resources have not been used for irrigation in china 5 569 billion m3 of 1 3 g l 1 saline water is exploited every year moreover approximately 151 million m3 of 3 5 g l 1 saline water is also exploited the sustainable development and utilisation of saline water resources are imperative as this would not only increase agricultural water resources but also alleviate the water shortage crises in semi arid and arid areas such as in xinjiang in north western china salinity management is a significant step towards the safe utilisation of saline water irrigation and it involves the reduction of the salt content in the soil to levels that are not harmful to cotton this results in more water being added to the soil than is needed for cotton growth this excess water infiltrates the soil and percolates through the root zone soil layer during percolation it takes a portion of the salt with it and leaches this salt into the deeper soil layers interestingly saline water also leaches salt out of the root zone however the excess irrigation water that causes leaching needs to be eliminated from the root zone and the deeper soil layer if it is not eliminated it can lead to a rise in the groundwater which may transport the salt back into the root zone through capillary forces therefore water loss and groundwater levels must be rigorously monitored and controlled to permit adequate root development to that end soil salinity management under long term saline water irrigation must enable leaching and sub surface drainage to allow for the removal of salts and the maintenance of an optimal salt balance fig 15 these processes are essential for the prevention and reduction of salinisation certain irrigation water salinity levels may induce a salt inhibition effect the effect of irrigation volumes times and periods on soil conditions and cotton growth especially during periods when crops are sensitive to salt levels needs further study to date most research has been based on indoor simulation experiments and short term field experiments however the effects of brackish and saline water on soil and crops are long term it is therefore essential to establish long term field experiments that evaluate the effects of saline water irrigation on soil water salt movement dynamics cotton physiology and crop yield further study is needed to evaluate the sustainability of saline water irrigation and provide management principles and practices for the safe utilisation of saline water irrigation in semi arid and arid regions 5 conclusions ensuring the effective exploitation and utilisation of saline water resources as well as establishing normative salinity water irrigation schedules are pressing problems in semi arid and arid regions based on the results obtained from a two year field experiment performed in 2018 and 2019 our main conclusions are as follows using the optimal water salinity level in mulched drip irrigation can accelerate photosynthesis thereby improving cotton yield irrigation water salinity levels above or below this optimum level will retard photosynthesis and reduce cotton yield the transpiration rates net photosynthetic rates main root lengths and cotton yields of the plants grown under irrigation water salinity levels of 3 g l 1 were the highest among our treatments this salinity level therefore is the most suitable for mulched drip irrigation it ensures that the water demand for cotton growth is met and does not cause salt stress that affects cotton physiology or growth wp decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity levels above 3 g l 1 the maximum wp values were observed at salinity level of 3 g l 1 at salinities of 1 6 g l 1 the wp values were significantly higher than those of plants grown under higher salinity conditions while the cotton yields remained unchanged when cotton was irrigated with saline water under mulched drip irrigation in a natural environment a salinity level of 3 g l 1 was found to benefit cotton growth and improve wp and did not result in secondary soil salinisation under long term saline water irrigation and water salt stress the mechanisms by which water and salt move through the cotton root zone and their influence on cotton yield and quality need further study to improve cotton production efficiency and control soil salinisation funding this work was supported by

10129,mulched drip irrigation using saline water has the potential to alleviate pressure on crop production from limited freshwater resources in arid and semi arid regions to explore the potential of saline water irrigation it is necessary to investigate how salt stress caused by saline water irrigation affects soil physico chemical properties and the physiology and growth of crops the effects of salt stress caused by saline water irrigation are complex and to date they are not well understood we aimed to analyse the distribution and dynamics of these properties to assess their effects on cotton growth yield and water productivity during a two year field experiment using saline water irrigation with various salinity levels 1 3 6 9 and 12 g l 1 cotton yield water productivity and their related components were significantly affected by the different salinity levels 1 irrigation water derived salt accumulated in the soil especially in the surface soil layer 0 20 cm but not in the 60 80 cm layer it was possible to rank cotton main root length based on salinity level as follows 3 1 6 9 12 g l 1 2 during the growth stage plants in the 3 g l 1 salinity treatment had transpiration rates 10 30 higher net photosynthetic rates 20 40 higher and yields 25 55 higher than those in the other treatments 3 the 3 g l 1 salinity treatment provided the optimal watering conditions for cotton and plants in this treatment displayed no salt stress symptoms in terms of their physiology or growth therefore this salinity level is suitable for the mulched drip irrigation of cotton using saline water our research provides guidance for further exploitation and utilisation of brackish and saline water resources and sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in semi arid and arid areas graphical abstract ga1 keywords saline water soil properties water and salt transport physiological indicators manas river basin arid land agriculture 1 introduction fresh water shortages and soil salinisation are the two primary factors limiting sustainable agriculture in many semi arid and arid regions worldwide the exploitation and utilisation of saline water resources have the potential to alleviate the ongoing freshwater shortages grillot 1954 pasternak et al 1986 rahman et al 2015 cotton gossypium hirsutum l is a salt tolerant crop that requires ample light christianson et al 2010 liu et al 2012 wang et al 2014 ning et al 2015 xinjiang is located in the hinterlands of northwest china and has a typical dry continental climate yang et al 2020a this area is suitable for cotton growth as the growing conditions are optimal for high dry matter accumulation and high quality long fibre growth the xinjiang cotton production area constitutes 30 of the total global area devoted to cotton and it produces 75 of the chinese cotton output in the past few decades mulched drip irrigation which can increase soil moisture and prevent soil secondary salinisation has been widely implemented in cotton cultivation in xinjiang to combat drought and water shortages an underground saline water resource in this region is gradually starting to be used to meet the increasing irrigation demands shen

respiration by roots and accumulation of toxic substances bouksila et al 2013 the correct balance of salt and water in the soil is central to successful crop growth increasing salt stress causes membrane lipid peroxidation protein oxidation and other damage to lipids proteins and nucleic acids leading to abnormal plant metabolism initial chlorophyll fluorescence is also reduced as are the maximum photochemical efficiency and maximum net photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2006 pang et al 2010 excess salt affects root water absorption photosynthesis and transpiration this leads to growth inhibition of roots stems leaves and other organs and reduces dry matter production ultimately leading to a reduction in crop yield parida et al 2005 stomata are the main channels for the exchange of co2 and o2 and the escape of water vapour from leaves maas and hoffman 1977 wu et al 2014 they use variable opening to regulate these transport processes thereby controlling leaf photosynthetic and transpiration rates guo et al 2005 rahman et al 2015 zhang et al 2006 the photosynthetic rate affects the roots stems leaves fruits and other plant organs and is therefore related to crop yield transpiration inevitably leads to water loss affecting crop photosynthesis and its rate has an important effect on available water resources and agricultural water utilisation efficiency yang et al 2015 ghaderi et al 2012 kang et al 2012 singh et al 2010 cotton can adapt to drought to a certain degree pettigrew 2004 however when under salt stress cotton growth is inhibited and plant height gain is significantly slowed this results in shorter plants grown under full irrigation liu et al 2012 salt stress can also affect the morphology and distribution of root growth and affect the ability of roots to absorb water and nutrients salt stress at the seedling stage promotes the growth of the main root and increases the number of lateral roots yazar et al 2002 moreover salt stress can inhibit the production of bolls and promote boll abscission resulting in reduced cotton yields on the one hand using saline water for agricultural irrigation can provide the necessary amount of water for crop growth but on the other hand saline water increases the accumulation of salt in the soil which negatively affects soil conditions and crop yield chen et al 2010 however many factors remain unclear such as 1 what is the appropriate irrigation water salinity level for cotton that ensures optimal yield and water productivity wp under saline water mulched drip irrigation and 2 what are the effects of different irrigation salinity levels on soil physico chemical properties and cotton physiological and biochemical processes and growth indices including the main root length leaf area index and dry mass accumulation to answer these questions we conducted a two year growing season field experiment to evaluate saline water utilisation by cotton under mulched drip irrigation the main objectives of this study were to 1 assess the effect of different water salinity levels applied via mulched drip irrigation on the soil salinity balance within the root zone 2 measure the effects of different water salinity levels on cotton growth physiological and biochemical processes yield and wp and 3 to determine the most suitable yield compatible salinity level for mulched drip irrigation using saline water to guide the sustainable development of future irrigation schemes and water resource utilisation planning for cotton production within semi arid and arid regions 2 material and methods 2 1

mm and 92 1 mm respectively 2 4 statistical analysis variance analysis was carried out using the spss 24 0 package spss inc chicago usa tukey s significant difference test was used to determine significant differences between the salinity treatments at p 0 05 the figures were created using originpro 2020b originlab usa 3 results 3 1 soil ph variations in soil ph under different salinity treatments are shown in fig 3 the soil ph followed a curved pattern across the entire growth period culminating in a single peak at the flowering stage in 2018 in general the soil ph increased with increasing salinity however the average ph was higher in treatment a than in treatments b c or d by 4 2 2 5 and 2 5 respectively the average ph in treatment a was lower than that in treatment e by 0 8 but there was no significant difference between a and e 3 2 soil moisture and ec the vertical distribution of soil moisture in the different soil layers under each treatment during 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 4 soil moisture fluctuated within the 0 100 cm soil layer in the 0 20 cm layer the observed soil moisture was 5 15 this large range may be a result of precipitation and the associated intense evaporation that follows soil moisture was high in the 20 80 cm layer in which the cotton root system is mainly distributed water consumption by cotton was high and the resulting change in soil moisture was clear in the 80 100 cm layer soil moisture levels were at their lowest for the duration of the experiment the soil moisture levels in the different salinity treatments were ordered as follows e d c b a root water absorption was restricted in the higher salinity 6 g l 1 treatments while plants in the lower salinity treatments a and b had improved root water absorption fig 5 shows the distribution of soil ec at different soil depths soil salinity increased slightly during the growth period particularly in the 0 20 cm surface soil layer however a reduction in salinity was observed in the 60 80 cm soil layer the soil ec range within the different treatments was 0 30 2 38 ms cm 1 with most values close to or greater than 1 5 ms cm 1 during the squaring stage in 2018 the experimental plots were first irrigated with saline water and the ec values measured at this stage were assigned as the ec background values representing long term mulched drip irrigation with fresh water as the growth period progressed the soil ec of each treatment was found to develop into a single peaked curve soil ec levels also varied with depth in the 0 100 cm sampling zone the maximum values of all treatments a b c d and e were observed in the 0 20 cm layer during the boll opening stage in 2018 1 30 1 72 2 01 and 2 10 ms cm 1 respectively the minimum ec values occurred in the 60 80 cm layer during the flowering stage in 2018 0 53 0 38 0 72 0 71 and 0 34 ms cm 1 respectively 3 3 soil hydro chemical characteristics piper diagrams were used to illustrate the hydro chemical species observed in the soil samples from the different salinity treatments in 2018 and 2019 fig 6 in all treatments in both years the ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl and hco3 concentrations were higher than those of the other ions measured the two main cations accounted for 50 80 of the milligram equivalent and the three anions accounted for 80 100 from 2018 2019 the main hydro chemical species in treatment a evolved from so4 2 ca2 to so4 2 mg2 ca2 similarly in treatment b so4 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 evolved into so4 2 ca2 mg2 in treatment c so4 2 ca2 evolved to so4 2 cl ca2 mg2 in treatment d so4 2 ca2 mg2 evolved into so4 2 cl ca2 mg2 na finally in treatment e so4 2 cl ca2 k evolved into so4 2 ca2 mg2 as salinity increased the milligram equivalent of anions gradually evolved from ca2 to mg2 and na and the cations gradually evolved from so4 2 to cl this was the main reason that the soil water hydro chemical species evolved from so4 2 ca2 to so4 2 cl ca2 mg2 na 3 4 net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate the pn of cotton varied throughout the 2018 growth period and followed a double peaked curve which reached its highest points during the flowering and bolling stages however in 2019 the pn followed a single peaked curve which reached its highest point during the flowering stage fig 7 treatment b showed the highest pn values in all growth stages during boll setting the pn values of the plants in treatment b were 8 2 and 10 9 higher in 2018 and 2019 respectively than those in treatment a in 2018 the pn values of the plants in the high salinity c d and e treatments were 21 2 29 7 and 40 7 lower

respectively in 2018 the tr values in treatments c d and e were 9 9 21 1 and 30 6 lower than those in treatment b respectively and they were 9 9 31 7 and 30 5 lower in 2019 3 5 stomatal conductance and intercellular co2 concentration gs and ci greatly affect photosynthesis in cotton leaves gs tends to decrease with increasing water salinity the gs values of the plants in treatment b were higher than those of any other treatments across all growth stages fig 8 the gs of cotton plants was significantly affected by the different salinity levels in the treatments during the flowering stage compared to the gs values in treatment b those in treatments a c d and e decreased by 6 1 38 5 46 2 and 51 9 respectively in 2018 and by 9 1 47 0 52 0 and 58 2 respectively in 2019 the ci increased with increasing water salinity and the levels in each treatment followed the shape of a single peaked curve throughout the two growing seasons these curves reached their maximum points during the bolling stage fig 8 during the bolling stage the ci values in treatment b were 27 5 and 21 2 high than those in treatment a in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared to the ci values in treatment b those in treatments c d and e increased by 5 2 7 8 and 15 7 respectively in 2018 and by 5 3 8 5 and 15 7 respectively in 2019 3 6 chlorophyll fluorescence the fo increased with increasing irrigation water salinity in all growth stages fig 9 following irrigation with saline water the fo of the plants in each treatment increased throughout the experiment the fo values of the plants in treatment e were higher than those in all the other treatments at each growth stage however regarding fm a contrasting result was observed fm decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity the fm values of the plants in treatment e were the lowest of all the treatments at each growth stage and they reached their minimum values during the boll opening stage throughout the growth stage in 2018 the fo values of the plants in treatments b c d and e were 2 3 5 1 10 1 and 13 8 higher respectively than that in treatment a and they were 1 6 5 2 14 4 and 19 3 higher in 2019 in 2018 the fm values of the plants in treatments b c d and e were 7 2 15 9 23 9 and 27 7 lower than that in treatment a respectively and they were 12 3 18 1 27 1 and 40 5 lower in 2019 the potential photosynthetic activity fv fo and maximum photosynthetic efficiency fv fm of ps ii both decreased as irrigation water salinity increased fig 10 throughout the growth stage in 2018 the fv fo values of the plants in treatments b c d and

affected by the different salinity treatments both indices were highest in plants grown in treatment b compared to those in the other treatments throughout the two year field experiment fig 11 in addition both indices were lower in plants from treatment e than in plants from any of the other treatments fig 11 the main root system lengths of the plants in treatment b were 45 3 and 10 6 longer than those in treatment a in 2018 and 2019 respectively the lai values of the plants in treatment b were also 1 2 and 29 2 higher in 2018 and 2019 respectively than those in treatment a in 2018 the main root lengths of the plants in treatments c d and e were 25 8 44 1 and 53 8 shorter respectively than those of the plants in treatment b and they were 15 1 23 3 and 30 1 shorter in 2019 in a similar comparison the lai values were 25 2 32 9 and 65 1 shorter in 2018 respectively and they were 39 7 68 2 and 69 6 shorter in 2019 respectively of all the treatments the dry matter production of roots stems and leaves were highest in the plants from treatment b in both years fig 12 the root dry matter production of the plants in treatment b was 10 1 and 12 7 higher than that of the plants in treatment a in 2018 and 2019 respectively comparing the same two treatments stem dry matter was 5 8 and 22 9 higher in 2018 and 2019 respectively and leaf dry matter was 1 7 and 3 2 higher in 2018 and 2019 respectively in 2018 the root dry matter production of the plants in treatments c d and e was 13 8 15 2 and 24 7 lower respectively than that of the plants in treatment b and they were 17 8 20 9 and 24 2 lower respectively in 2019 stem dry matter production in the same comparison of treatments c d and e vs b was 21 28 6 and 47 3 lower respectively in 2018 and 19 8 29 3 and 41 3 lower respectively in 2019 leaf dry matter production when comparing the same treatments was 10 5 25 7 and 9 0 lower respectively in 2018 and 9 5 22 4 and 26 3 lower respectively in 2019 3 8 cotton yield and wp cotton yield and wp were significantly affected by the different salinity treatments in both years fig 13 both indices decreased with increasing salinity yield and wp were higher in the plants grown in treatments a b and c than in those grown in the other treatments when the salinity level was greater than 6 g l 1 yield and wp were significantly negatively affected when the cotton plants were exposed to salinity levels between 1 g l 1 and 6 g l 1 yield and wp greatly increased the yields of treatment b were 13 1 and 24 1 higher than those of treatment a in 2018 and 2019 respectively using the optimal irrigation water salinity level may therefore improve cotton yield finally in 2018 the yields in treatments c d and e were 17 8 38 0 and 55 6 lower respectively than that in treatment b and they were 25 1 43 5 and 60 lower respectively in 2019 the wp of the cotton grown in treatment b was the highest across all treatments and it was 12 5 and 24 higher than that in treatment a in 2018 and 2019 respectively given that the plants were irrigated with saline water in 2018 treatments c d and e used 17 5 38 1 and 55 6 less water respectively than the plants in treatment b and they used 25 1 43 1 and 58 7 less water respectively in 2019 4 discussion 4 1 effect of water salinity on the soil salinity balance in the root zone area saline water irrigation causes salt leaching and the accumulation of salts in the soil when the leaching process is dominant irrigation with saline water can be carried out without significant negative effects when there is significant salt accumulation saline water irrigation systems need to be supplemented with freshwater alternatively during periods of high evaporation the irrigation quantity needs to be increased to wash the salt away from the root zone a correlation matrix between soil moisture and soil salinity at different soil depths is shown in fig 14 the correlation between soil moisture and ec gradually decreased with increasing soil depth soil moisture content increases with increasing salinity in the middle and later periods of cotton growth liu et al 2016 salt that infiltrates the soil via mulched drip irrigation reduces soil water potential causing salt stress in the cotton root system and affecting soil moisture absorption and utilisation chen et al 2010 in our study soil ec was strongly affected by the irrigation water salinity levels used in the treatments the salt content of the surface soil 0 20 cm is directly affected by irrigation and evaporation as both leaching and salt accumulation are significant in this zone when we compared the salt content of the soils at different depths we found that the surface layer contained the highest amount of salt across all the different salinity treatments salt accumulates in the surface layer of soil in response to high surface temperatures low vegetation coverage and high evaporation rates in addition owing to the concurrent action of water uptake by the cotton roots and capillary force saline water can be transported from lower soil depths to the surface soil layer liu et al 2012 this can also determine the salt levels in the surface soil layer this may explain why the salt levels in the surface soil layers were greater than those of the deeper soil layers under all the different salinity treatments in our study the 20 60 cm zone is where the cotton roots are located and the mulched drip irrigation wetting zone causes salt to leach out of the crop cultivation layer these factors can have a significant effect on salt distribution in the soil under mulched drip irrigation we found that soil salt levels were generally highest in the periphery below 60 cm of the wetted zone removal of the salts that have accumulated in this wetting zone front would be required in the long term to maintain production levels although soil salt levels increased significantly in the first year of treatments with salinity levels from 1 to 3 g l 1 they then stabilised and remained stable during the second year similar results were obtained by li et al 2016 2017 in another type of saline soil therefore from the perspective of soil water salt movement it is feasible to use water with salt concentrations of 3 g l 1 for the irrigation of cotton in arid and semi arid regions as it is unlikely to result in secondary salinisation of the soil 4 2 effect of water salinity on root zone soil hydro chemical characteristics effectively controlling or reducing the accumulation of soil salts by accelerating the discharge of harmful ions from the soil layer is an important step towards the safe use of saline water in farmland irrigation the salts dissolved in irrigation water disperse as ions each affecting soil conditions and cotton growth in a different way the effects of the different salinity treatments were mainly related to changes in eight ions and the hydro chemical characteristics of the soil solution zhang et al 2006 following saline water irrigation the composition of the saline ions in the soil changed harmful ions such as na and cl increased while k and ca2 decreased in this study the levels of k na ca2 so4 2 and cl were highest in the 0 20 cm soil layer in each treatment when the salinity level was less than or equal to 6 g l 1 the surface soil s salt levels were in equilibrium the so4 2 content varied widely across the salinity range and it was the most prevalent ion throughout the cotton growth period the higher the salinity the higher the ca2 k na so4 2 and cl content in the soil brackish or saline water irrigation causes the salt in the soil to migrate with the irrigation water and salt ions are carried into the soil body guo et al 2005 in our study salt accumulation increased with increasing irrigation water salinity i e the higher the irrigation water salt content the greater the salt accumulation and ion content in the soil soil ion migration differs depending on the type of salt ion considered single valence ions such as na cl k and hco3 are not easily adsorbed onto soil colloids and these ions tend to move with soil water accumulating where the water slows double valence ions such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 and co3 2 are more easily adsorbed onto soil particles so they accumulate in the wetted soil body and are evenly distributed through the soil profile in this study a small amount of salt accumulation occurred at depths below 60 cm piper diagrams use the milligram equivalent percentage of the main cations na k ca2 and mg2 and anions cl so4 2 and hco3 co3 2 in each litre of water to illustrate the chemical characteristics of the hydrological system in the soil ray and mukherjee 2008 combined with the hydrogeological conditions of an area they can be used to analyse the evolution of its groundwater chemistry chadha 1999 in our study the main cation type at the outset was ca2 at a milligram equivalent percentage of 50 80 and the main anion types were so4 2 cl and hco3 at 80 100 at high irrigation salinities the soil hydro chemical characteristics in the root zone changed from so4 2 and hco3 to cl and fromca2 to mg2 and k 4 3 effect of water salinity on physiological and biochemical processes in cotton salts had both general and specific effects on cotton growth that directly affected crop yields although cotton is relatively salt tolerant high soil salinity levels affect its growth and development ahmed et al 2012 saline water irrigation reduces the water potential of the soil solution thus causing soil root leaf osmotic stress which causes water absorption problems in the plant roots fig 15 these effects induce a series of physiological and biochemical changes in cotton under salt stress niu et al 2010 including partial stomatal closure and a reductions in stomatal conductance and the transpiration rate of leaves affecting growth photosynthesis and co2 balance these changes ultimately affect dry matter accumulation and yield koyro et al 2008 canopy photosynthesis can provide 90 95 of total dry matter production ludlow 1985 we found that saltwater irrigation can cause salt stress which can reduce the pn tr and gs of cotton analysing the causes showed that salt stress caused by saltwater irrigation increased the osmotic potential of the soil solution reduced the effectiveness of soil water use damaged the cytoplasmic membranes of cotton roots increased the water potential gradient of cotton leaves caused cellular osmotic stress hindered the absorption of nutrients and water decreased stomatal opening on cotton leaf surfaces and decreased the rate of co2 entering the mesophyll cells this all leads to a decrease in photosynthesis at higher irrigation water salinity levels the ci of the cotton increased moreover salt stress also leads to leaf stomatal contraction which limits the absorption of atmospheric co2 by the leaves and leads to insufficient photosynthesis this may have resulted in the observed reduction in cotton yield analysing the causes showed that the accumulated salt ions absorbed from the soil by the cotton plants destruction of chloroplast structures and the decrease in mesophyll cells photosynthetic activity led to higher ci values this indicates that the pn tr and gs of cotton are limited by ci our results showed that the fm fv fo and fv fm of cotton decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity with an increase in salt stress the concentrations of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide hydroxyl groups oh hydrogen peroxide h2o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 and other non free radicals increase this causes membrane lipid peroxidation protein oxidation and damage to lipids proteins and nucleic acid which all contribute to abnormal metabolism functioning this in turn results in reductions in the initial chlorophyll fluorescence maximum photochemical efficiency photochemical quenching coefficient apparent quantum efficiency light compensation and saturation points electron transfer rate maximum net photosynthetic rate and dark respiration rate in summary it is likely that the salt stress in our study led to a reduction in cotton photosynthesis when the dark reaction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain was impaired photosynthesis between photosystem ii and i was undermined and co2 assimilation was limited 4 4 effect of water salinity on cotton growth processes it has been found that 85 of the cotton root system is distributed in the 30 50 cm soil layer under mulched drip irrigation yang et al 2017b cotton root growth is extremely sensitive to variations in soil conditions the presence of salt in the root zone can have a major effect on growth this is the largest problem facing cotton growers who depend on irrigation cotton root systems grow better in irrigation systems when there is a high soil moisture content and low soil salinity cotton roots first absorb soil water through their deep roots which have a high water potential therefore most of the water initially taken up by the roots is from a less saline soil depth however as more water is removed the total water stress increases to a level equal to that in the lower depths after this water is also absorbed from the shallower more saline soil layers and the effect of salinity on cotton growth is magnified in this study the main root length and dry matter production were highest in plants grown in the 3 g l 1 salinity treatment a good root system increases water and nutrient uptake and consequently improves cotton yield and wp feng et al 2017 the leaf is an important vegetative organ in cotton as in many plants as it is the key site of photosynthesis landivar et al 1983 in our study the effect of salt stress on cotton growth was indicated by changes in leaf growth lai values measured over time reflected changes in leaf area within the experimental plant populations lai is also indicative in terms of several important parameters including photosynthesis transpiration and biomass formation sinclair and horie 1989 the amount of salt in the soil affects plant biomass and the distribution of the root system with increasing soil salt levels the growth of cotton roots becomes seriously inhibited and the yield is reduced miura and tada 2014 our results show that a salinity level of more than 6 g l 1 inhibited the expansion of cotton leaf cover leading to a decrease in the lai and leaf dry mass higher salinities caused slower growth and lower roots stems and leaf qualities as well as lower lais and yields the accumulation of cotton biomass is the basis for obtaining high yield and high quality cotton cotton has a high salt tolerance and soil salt may increase the dry matter accumulation of cotton within a range suitable for cotton growth with increasing irrigation frequency we found that the soil salt content also gradually increased the treatment which induced only slight salt stress in the cotton plants had little effect on dry matter accumulation per cotton plant whereas the severe treatment strongly inhibited it optimal levels of saline water irrigation are favourable to the development of cotton root systems under mulched drip irrigation as it causes the dry matter accumulation and wp to increase water salinity levels of 3 g l 1 may significantly increase the accumulation of dry matter in cotton and promote the transfer of nutrients from the vegetative organs to the reproductive organs we found that when the water salinity level was greater than or equal to 6 g l 1 the accumulation of dry matter greatly inhibited nutrient transfer the question of how to compensate for this effect to create optimal conditions for crop roots to absorb water when the soil osmotic potential has been reduced by saline water irrigation remains unanswered and requires significant future research fig 15 4 5 effect of water salinity on cotton yield and wp generally the water potential of soil of any given texture depends on its moisture and salt levels at any fixed drip irrigation input rate the more saline the irrigation water the more salt ions are carried into the soil body and the lower the soil water potential and osmotic effects this inhibits plant water absorption and causes a chemical drought where crops wither owing to water shortage despite the soil remaining moist fig 15 rengasamy 2010 in contrast water salinity has a greater effect on water consumption by cotton and wp strongly affects total water consumption sinclair et al 1984 our research has shown that wp was significantly compromised when the water salinity was greater than 9 g l 1 however we also found that the wp improved as the salinity levels increased from 1 to 6 g l 1 the main reasons for this were that cotton stops growing during the bolling stage and that the water consumption of cotton mainly depends on the evaporation intensity at ground level and the total amount of water contained in the soil when mulched drip irrigation with highly saline water is used there are more salts in the soil and it has a lower water potential which makes it difficult for the cotton roots to absorb water saline water always contains high concentration of trace elements zn b which may be conducive to cotton growth because the cooperation and antagonism between trace elements and salt can lessen salt damage chen et al 2017 2018 cotton yield was significantly influenced by the salinity levels of the irrigation water in addition the high concentrations of salt in the irrigation water inhibited cotton growth the long term use of brackish and saline water irrigation causes a dramatic decrease in cotton yield when irrigated with saline water the cotton yields in treatments c d and e were substaintially lower than those in treatments a and b this indicates that low concentrations of saline water may reduce salt accumulation thereby reducing salt stress in the root zone 4 6 utilisation of saline water for agricultural irrigation in semi arid and arid regions ocean covers approximately 71 of the globe saline water constitutes 97 5 of all water resources with only 2 5 being freshwater agricultural practices consume a large portion of these freshwater resources and global agricultural irrigation is still dependent on freshwater while most brackish and saline water resources have not been used for irrigation in china 5 569 billion m3 of 1 3 g l 1 saline water is exploited every year moreover approximately 151 million m3 of 3 5 g l 1 saline water is also exploited the sustainable development and utilisation of saline water resources are imperative as this would not only increase agricultural water resources but also alleviate the water shortage crises in semi arid and arid areas such as in xinjiang in north western china salinity management is a significant step towards the safe utilisation of saline water irrigation and it involves the reduction of the salt content in the soil to levels that are not harmful to cotton this results in more water being added to the soil than is needed for cotton growth this excess water infiltrates the soil and percolates through the root zone soil layer during percolation it takes a portion of the salt with it and leaches this salt into the deeper soil layers interestingly saline water also leaches salt out of the root zone however the excess irrigation water that causes leaching needs to be eliminated from the root zone and the deeper soil layer if it is not eliminated it can lead to a rise in the groundwater which may transport the salt back into the root zone through capillary forces therefore water loss and groundwater levels must be rigorously monitored and controlled to permit adequate root development to that end soil salinity management under long term saline water irrigation must enable leaching and sub surface drainage to allow for the removal of salts and the maintenance of an optimal salt balance fig 15 these processes are essential for the prevention and reduction of salinisation certain irrigation water salinity levels may induce a salt inhibition effect the effect of irrigation volumes times and periods on soil conditions and cotton growth especially during periods when crops are sensitive to salt levels needs further study to date most research has been based on indoor simulation experiments and short term field experiments however the effects of brackish and saline water on soil and crops are long term it is therefore essential to establish long term field experiments that evaluate the effects of saline water irrigation on soil water salt movement dynamics cotton physiology and crop yield further study is needed to evaluate the sustainability of saline water irrigation and provide management principles and practices for the safe utilisation of saline water irrigation in semi arid and arid regions 5 conclusions ensuring the effective exploitation and utilisation of saline water resources as well as establishing normative salinity water irrigation schedules are pressing problems in semi arid and arid regions based on the results obtained from a two year field experiment performed in 2018 and 2019 our main conclusions are as follows using the optimal water salinity level in mulched drip irrigation can accelerate photosynthesis thereby improving cotton yield irrigation water salinity levels above or below this optimum level will retard photosynthesis and reduce cotton yield the transpiration rates net photosynthetic rates main root lengths and cotton yields of the plants grown under irrigation water salinity levels of 3 g l 1 were the highest among our treatments this salinity level therefore is the most suitable for mulched drip irrigation it ensures that the water demand for cotton growth is met and does not cause salt stress that affects cotton physiology or growth wp decreased with increasing irrigation water salinity levels above 3 g l 1 the maximum wp values were observed at salinity level of 3 g l 1 at salinities of 1 6 g l 1 the wp values were significantly higher than those of plants grown under higher salinity conditions while the cotton yields remained unchanged when cotton was irrigated with saline water under mulched drip irrigation in a natural environment a salinity level of 3 g l 1 was found to benefit cotton growth and improve wp and did not result in secondary soil salinisation under long term saline water irrigation and water salt stress the mechanisms by which water and salt move through the cotton root zone and their influence on cotton yield and quality need further study to improve cotton production efficiency and control soil salinisation funding this work was supported by
