19520,legionella infections are among the most important waterborne infections with constantly increasing numbers of cases in industrialized countries as a result of aging populations rising numbers of immunocompromised individuals and increased need for conditioned water due to climate change surveillance of water systems is based on microbiological culture based techniques however it has been shown that high percentages of the legionella populations in water systems are not culturable in the past two decades the relevance of such viable but non culturable vbnc legionellae has been controversially discussed and whether vbnc legionellae can directly infect human macrophages the primary targets of legionella infections remains unclear in this study it was demonstrated for the first time that several starved vbnc legionella strains four l pneumophila serogroup 1 strains a serogroup 6 strain and a l micdadei strain can directly infect different types of human macrophages and amoebae even after one year of starvation in ultrapure water however under these conditions the strains caused infection with reduced efficacy as represented by the lower percentages of infected cells prolonged time in co culture and higher multiplicities of infection required interestingly the vbnc cells remained mostly non culturable even after multiplication within the host cells amoebal infection by starved vbnc legionella which likely occurs in oligotrophic biofilms would result in an increase in the bacterial concentration in drinking water systems if cells remain in the vbnc state the real number of active legionellae will be underestimated by the use of culture based standard techniques thus further quantitative research is needed in order to determine whether and how many starved vbnc legionella cells are able to cause disease in humans graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella vbnc starvation acanthamoeba macrophages 1 introduction legionellae are mostly waterborne pathogenic gram negative bacteria that cause legionnaires disease ld and a milder form of infection known as pontiac fever fields et al 2002 in 2015 7034 notified cases of ld were reported in the european union norway iceland and switzerland ecdc 2017 of the culture confirmed cases 81 belonged to l pneumophila serogroup 1 ecdc 2017 however these numbers are unlikely to reflect the true incidence of ld in some countries due to the low notification rate in these countries leading to a high number of unreported cases ecdc 2017 von baum et al 2008 engineered water systems with elevated temperatures are common sources of legionellae associated with human disease bartram et al 2007 showers cooling towers hot and cold water distribution systems and air conditioning systems are frequently densely colonized by legionellae as part of naturally formed biofilms bartram et al 2007 it is in these biofilms that legionellae encounter free living amoebae fla which are the natural hosts of legionellae not only are fla facultative pathogens themselves visvesvara et al 2007 but they also play a very important role in aquatic ecosystems as predators of bacteria rodríguez zaragoza 1994 the co existence of fla and bacteria in the environment triggered the selection of grazing resistance strategies which influenced the pathogenesis of several bacterial genera amaro et al 2015 among these bacteria legionella spp not only evolved to resist amoebal digestion but also to exploit their hosts as nutrient sources and to replicate within the hosts fields et al 2002 moreover fla transform partially to extremely resistant cysts and can thus protect intracellular bacteria from disinfectants and other adverse environmental stressors cervero aragó et al 2015 dupuy et al 2011 thomas et al 2004 the transmission of legionellae occurs via the inhalation of small aerosols from improperly operated and monitored water systems once in the lungs the bacteria encounter another type of phagocytic cells namely alveolar macrophages legionella then use a very similar strategy to the one used within the amoebae to not only survive digestion but also replicate within the new host greub and raoult 2004 swanson and hammer 2000 thus humans are accidental hosts of legionella amaro et al 2015 ashbolt 2015 among the human populations elderly males and immunocompromised people are particularly susceptible ecdc 2017 in the aquatic environment exposure to stress can induce gram negative bacteria to enter the viable but non culturable vbnc state as a survival strategy oliver 2010 generally vbnc cells are viable cells that have lost their culturability in standard culture media but little is known regarding the physiological processes the underlying genetic or epigenetic regulation and the virulence of these cells kirschner 2016 different stressors that induce the transition of legionellae to the vbnc state have been described most important among these stressors are starvation schrammel et al submitted steinert et al 1997 chemical treatments such as chlorination garcía et al 2007 and heat allegra et al 2008 these vbnc cells have also been shown to potentially resuscitate regaining culturability via passage through amoebae ducret et al 2014 garcía et al 2007 steinert et al 1997 quantitative information has only been presented by al bana et al 2014 who reported that only one to three out of 100 000 starved vbnc cells were able to resuscitate in amoebae so far direct infection of human cells by vbnc legionellae or resuscitation from the vbnc state after contact with these cells has never been observed the aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the infectivity of six strains of vbnc legionellae during short term and long term starvation in ultrapure water in amoebae macrophages derived from the human monocytic cell line thp 1 and two primary human macrophage cell types in addition the recovery of culturability after host cell infection was analysed at the same time the transition from culture to the vbnc state and the vbnc state itself of the six legionella strains were monitored and characterized in detail for up to one year see companion paper schrammel et al submitted 2 material and methods 2 1 selected legionella strains in total six different legionella strains were used for the experiments four l pneumophila serogroup 1 sg1 strains were obtained from different sources l pneumophila sg1 mab subtype olda lpolda strain collection nctc 12008 public health england l pneumophila sg1 mab subtype france allentown isolated from an environmental source lpenv and l pneumophila sg1 subtype mab benidorm isolated from a clinical source lpclin both strains provided by a indra austrian agency for health and food safety vienna austria and l pneumophila sg1 mab subtype philadelphia lpparis provided by y héchard university of poitiers france the three latter strains belong to the most virulent mab 3 1 subtype according to the dresden panel helbig et al 2002 additionally we used one l pneumophila serogroup 6 strain lpsg6 strain collection nctc 11287 and a clinical l micdadei isolate lmic technical university dresden germany all strains were stored at 80 c in cryotubes rotistore carl roth karlsruhe germany 2 2 acanthamoeba culture acanthamoeba castellanii genotype t4 strain spa08 isolated from a keratitis patient pumidonming et al 2010 was chosen as a model system the strain was cultivated at room temperature on non nutrient agar nna plates previously coated with heat killed e coli axenic cultures and trophozoite sub cultures for infection assays were prepared as previously described dietersdorfer et al 2016 for co culturing axenic trophozoite suspensions of 1 105 amoeba cells ml 1 were transferred to 12 well cell culture plates plates were incubated at 30 c for 1 h to allow amoebal adherence to the bottoms of the wells then the peptone yeast glucose pyg medium was replaced with 1 ml of 1 10 pyg medium diluted in page s amoeba saline pas atcc1323 2 3 generation of thp 1 macrophages thp 1 a gift from alexandre m carmo instituto de biologia molecular e celular porto portugal is a human monocytic cell line derived from an acute monocytic leukaemia patient the cells were maintained in rpmi 1640 medium sigma aldrich steinheim germany supplemented with 100 μg ml 1 streptomycin 100 u ml 1 penicillin sigma aldrich and 10 fetal bovine serum fbs sigma aldrich in a humidified atmosphere with 5 co2 at 37 c the cells were counted and adjusted to a final concentration of 1 105 cells ml 1 using a hemocytometer then 1 ml of the cell suspension was transferred to a 12 well cell culture plate for the differentiation of thp 1 cells into macrophage like cells 50 ng ml 1 of phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate pma sigma aldrich was added and the cells were incubated for 72 h as described abdelhady and garduño 2013 differentiation was accompanied by increased cell adherence to the cell culture plastics and by upregulation of the cell surface antigens cd11b cd18 and cd87 which we monitored by flow cytometry as previously described machacek et al 2016 after 3 days the cells were washed twice with pre warmed phosphate buffered saline pbs finally 1 ml of fresh rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10 fbs without antibiotics was added to each well 2 4 generation of monocyte derived primary human macrophages peripheral blood leukocytes of healthy donors obtained from the blood bank of the medical university of vienna austria were separated into plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs and granulocytes with erythrocytes using lymphoprep gradient centrifugation axis shield oslo norway cd14 monocytes were further purified from pbmcs using cd14 macs microbeads miltenyi biotech bergisch gladbach germany and differentiated to macrophages with either 25 ng ml 1 recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor gm csf novartis basel switzerland or 50 ng ml 1 recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor m csf peprotech rocky hill nj as detailed elsewhere ohradanova repic et al 2016 after 7 days both types of differentiated macrophages were detached by trypsinization washed twice with pbs and resuspended in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l glutamine 5 fetal calf serum and 5 ng ml 1 gm csf or m csf then macrophages were seeded into 12 well plates at 1 105 cells well 1 and were left to recover for 24 h prior to infection assays 2 5 generation of starvation microcosms all legionella microcosms were prepared as explained in detail in our companion paper schrammel et al submitted briefly l pneumophila strains were grown in liquid buffered yeast extract broth libye modified from edelstein 1981 fifty millilitre tubes containing 7 5 ml of libye were inoculated with one bead from the cryoculture and incubated at 37 c at an angle of 45 under rotation at 150 rpm until the cells reached the stationary phase lpolda lpclin and lpsg6 73 h lpparis 103 h and lpenv 90 h fifty microliters of stationary phase culture were transferred into new 50 ml tubes with 7 5 ml of fresh libye under the same conditions for 47 h except for lpparis which took 63 h lmic was first grown on bcye plates biomerieux vienna austria at 37 c for 72 h three colonies from the plate were then transferred into libye and incubated like the other strains for 48 h stationary phase legionella cultures were then washed twice by centrifugation at 3500 g at 20 c supernatants were discarded and the cells were resuspended in ultrapure water by vortexing after checking the od600 value the volume required to achieve a legionella concentration of 1 108 cells ml 1 in 350 ml of autoclaved ultrapure water was inoculated into the starvation microcosms in sterile glass bottles for each strain three different microcosms originating from three different beads were prepared legionella microcosms were then incubated without shaking at 45 c and analysed at different time points for up to one year fig 1 2 6 experimental design the experiment was divided into short term and long term starvation periods for over one year fig 1 in the short term period all microcosms 3 bottles per legionellae strain were monitored from time 0 until complete loss of culturability followed by an additional two to three weeks for the l pneumophila sg1 strains five weeks in total in the case of lpsg6 and lmic 7 and 10 weeks respectively samples of each microcosm were taken once a week and co cultured with acanthamoeba castellanii and thp 1 macrophages in the long term starvation period a pooled sample of the 3 microcosm bottles per strain was co cultured with the same two hosts and with primary macrophages derived from human monocytes at 2 4 extra timepoints for up to one year in parallel culturability viability parameters amino acid uptake see schrammel et al submitted and the presence of outer membrane related virulence factors of legionella microcosms schrammel et al in preparation were also analysed fig 1 2 7 legionella culturability during starvation at each sampling timepoint the culturability of the starved legionella strains was analysed before and after co culture with the different hosts first tenfold dilution series of legionella microcosm samples were transferred to bcye buffered charcoal yeast extract agar plates without antibiotics biomerieux vienna austria then once an ongoing infection was confirmed by microscopy see section 2 8 1 ml of co culture suspension was directly plated on bcye agar all plates were incubated at 37 c for at least 10 days and checked every 3 4 days for growth of legionella colonies 2 8 infection of amoebae thp 1 macrophages and monocyte derived primary human macrophages for the short term starvation period three legionella starvation microcosms per strain were analysed in parallel for the long term period a pool of the three replicates per strain was used every bacterial suspension was directly added to amoeba and macrophage cultures prepared as explained above at different multiplicities of infection moi 1 50 100 and 400 legionellae per amoeba 1 10 50 100 and 200 legionellae per thp 1 macrophages and 50 and 100 legionellae per primary human macrophage cell type to enhance the interaction between legionellae and host cells the plates were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min in the case of amoebae and at 300 g for 5 min in the case of thp 1 macrophages amoeba co cultures were then incubated at 30 c while co cultures with human cells were incubated at 37 c in a 5 co2 atmosphere 2 9 monitoring of legionella infections co cultures were observed daily by using an inverted microscope olympus ck 2 vienna austria when the host cells showed any sign of infection intracellular replication of legionella cells the cells from the corresponding well were harvested samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min 300 g for macrophage co cultures the supernatant was discarded and 10 μl of the suspension was transferred onto a 10 well teflon coated slide medco health solutions inc münchen germany which were dried at 37 c for 30 min samples were then fixed in 20 μl of 4 paraformaldehyde in pbs for 10 min at room temperature washed twice with pbs and dehydrated for 3 min in an aqueous ethanol series 50 80 and 96 l pneumophila cells were then stained using the monofluo l pneumophila ifa test kit bio rad laboratories inc redmont usa dietersdorfer et al 2016 l micdadei lmic cells were stained by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish

staining solution was added to the fixed cells on the slides and the slides were incubated in a humid chamber in the dark at 46 c for 2 h then the slides were washed in pre warmed washing buffer 2 15 ml of 5 mol l 1 nacl 1 ml of 1 mol l 1 tris hcl and 0 5 ml of 0 5 mol l 1 edta filled to a volume of 50 ml with ultrapure water for 15 min at 48 c in a water bath subsequently the slides were briefly dipped into 80 ethanol and dried in the dark the slides were mounted with dapi mix 40 μl of 50 μg ml 1 dapi 1540 μl of citifluor hatfield pennsylvania usa 280 μl of vectashield vector laboratories inc peterborough uk and 140 μl of pbs for counterstaining finally all slides were observed using a nikon eclipse 8000 epifluorescence microscope and images were captured by using a nikon ds qimc camera and nis elements br 2 3 software nikon the cells were considered to be infected when vesicles of more than five legionella bright cells were observed within the host cells co cultures of hosts without bacteria were used as negative controls andfresh legionella suspensions prepared as described above were used as positive controls slides with stained primary monocyte derived macrophage co cultures were used to calculate the percentage of infected hosts in relation to the total number of host cells 3 results 3 1 infectivity of short term starved vbnc legionella in amoebae and thp 1 macrophages the time required to observe the total loss of culturability i e approximately 8 log10 reduction in the number of colony forming units was dependent on the legionella strain investigated fig 2 more details in schrammel et al submitted all l pneumophila sg1 strains lost their culturability within 14 days lpsg6 and lmic lost their culturability after 4 and 8 weeks respectively likewise the infectivity patterns of the legionellae strongly depended on the respective strains and differences between hosts were observed all legionella strains were able to replicate within amoebae at least as long as the strains were culturable at all mois tested fig 2 with the exception of lmic which became non infectious shortly before total loss of culturability and lpsg6 which infected amoebae at all timepoints analysed at timepoint 0 vesicles of replicating bacteria within amoebae were already observable for all l pneumophila sg1 strains within 24 h of co culture after one week of starvation it was observed that the time in co culture until replication was prolonged to 4 days after total loss of culturability four out of the five l pneumophila strains lpolda lpclin lpparis and lpsg6 further infected the amoebae during the short term starvation period infectious vbnc lpolda lpparis and lpclin cells were observed only for the highest mois 50 and 100 and only at day 28 and day 35 of starvation requiring long co culturing times of 7 22 days lpsg6 remained infective until the end of the short term starvation period up to 49 days for different mois requiring 2 3 days for the highest mois tested 100 and 400 and 7 days for the lowest mois 1 and 50 in co culture with amoebae fig 2 all l pneumophila sg 1 strains replicated within thp 1 macrophages at least as long as culturable cells were present lpsg6 although still culturable only infected thp 1 macrophages right after inoculation in ultrapure water timepoint 0 lmic similar to the results of the amoeba co culture stopped infecting thp 1 macrophages shortly before the total loss of culturability after 7 weeks of starvation for all six strains no thp 1 macrophages infection was observed after the legionella strains lost their culturability in the short term period none of the vbnc legionella strains regained their culturability after co culture with the two host models used not even after passage through the host cells fig 2 3 2 infectivity of long term starved vbnc legionellae in amoeba and thp 1 macrophages the infectivity of long term starved vbnc legionella cells was studied by pooling the triplicate samples of the starvation microcosms all legionella strains infected amoebae at least at one timepoint after more than 115 days of starvation figs 2 and 3 lpolda infected amoebae after 115 197 and 315 days in ultrapure water but only at mois of 100 and 400 replication in the host cells was already visible after 3 7 days at each timepoint of the long term starvation period lpclin replicated in amoebae only at the highest moi 400 after 3 8 days in co culture lpparis and lpenv were infective after 277 344 only lpparis and 396 days of starvation only at the higher mois after 4 8 days in co culture after 126 221 and 273 days of starvation and at high mois lpsg6 also replicated in amoebae and was the only strain that remained infective in amoebae at each time point tested throughout the experiment with a small increase in the time in co culture required to observe infection throughout the long time period lmic infected amoebae only after 221 days at an moi of 400 figs 2 and 3 all l pneumophila sg1 strains infected thp 1 macrophages during the long term starvation period but only at single timepoints however neither lpsg6 nor lmic caused infection interestingly vbnc lpolda and lpclin cells infected thp 1 macrophages only after 263 days of starvation for the three mois tested 50 100 and 400 the time required to observe the infection ranged from 3 to 7 days lpenv and lpparis infected thp 1 macrophages only after 344 days of starvation lpparis infected thp 1 macrophages after 3 7 days at all three mois tested and lpenv infected thp 1 macrophages after 7 days only at an moi of 100 figs 2 and 3 as observed in the short term period even after positive infection events none of the vbnc legionella strains regained their culturability in the long term starvation period fig 2 3 3 infectivity of long term starved vbnc legionellae in monocyte derived primary human macrophages thp 1 macrophages due to the leukaemic monocytic nature of the parental thp 1 cells are an excellent model for generating high numbers of macrophage like cells however these cells have a limitation because we do not know which natural macrophage type they most closely resemble therefore to get one step closer to an in vivo model we differentiated human peripheral blood monocytes with either m csf or gm csf to generate primary human macrophages resembling either tissue or alveolar macrophages respectively patel et al 2017 co cultures with these monocyte derived primary human macrophages were performed at three timepoints for the long term starved vbnc legionellae figs 3 and 4 overall legionella strains were more infective on gm csf macrophages than on m csf macrophages lpolda infected gm csf macrophages after 200 263 and 315 days of starvation at mois of 50 and 100 whereas the same strain infected m csf macrophages only at the two last timepoints at the highest mois lpclin infected gm csf macrophages after 200 and 263 days of starvation and m csf macrophages only after 263 days lpenv lpparis and lpsg6 infected both macrophage cell types at all the timepoints tested lmic infected m csf macrophages only after 221 days of starvation but never infected gm csf macrophages figs 3 and 4 the time required to observe legionella infections in gm csf and m csf macrophage co cultures ranged between 3 and 8 days regardless of the primary macrophage cell type used interestingly unlike what was observed in the previous co cultures some vbnc legionella strains regained their culturability after passage through m csf and gm csf macrophages fig 4 colonies of lpenv on bcye plates were observed after infection of gm csf macrophages after 281 days of starvation lpparis regained culturability after infecting both cell types after 344 days of starvation and after 221 days of starvation lmic grew on bcye plates after passage through m csf macrophages 3 4 estimation of the number of starved vbnc legionellae that caused infection in primary monocyte derived macrophages in an attempt to estimate the number of starved vbnc legionellae that caused infection in primary monocyte derived macrophages the percentage of infected m csf and gm csf macrophages in relation to the total number of macrophages per well was calculated table 1 percentages in each co culture were calculated by counting at least 200 macrophages per well per moi and per timepoint in the co culture analysed such estimations were only made for primary macrophages because these macrophages are the closest model to an in vivo situation and almost all the strains infected these macrophages at all the timepoints analysed in spite of the limitations of the methodology used such as different starvation timepoints or different days in co culture a general trend could be observed culturable cells of lpclin and lpparis were used as positive controls the two strains infected approximately 62 of gm csf macrophages and 43 of m csf macrophages at an moi of 50 right after inoculation in ultrapure water in contrast after at least 221 days of starvation the six legionella strains replicated in 0 7 4 6 of gm csf macrophages and in 0 9 6 3 of m csf macrophages at an moi of 100 requiring at least 3 days in co culture table 1 for an moi of 100 1 107 legionella cells ml 1 were added to 1 105 host cells ml 1 assuming that one legionella cell is enough to cause an infection we can calculate that between 700 and 6300 starved vbnc legionella cells out of 1 107 cells ml 1 remained infective in primary macrophages after at least 221 days under starvation conditions compared to 40 000 and 65 000 out of 5 106 cells ml 1 of culturable legionella cells supplementary information 4 discussion since the discovery of the vbnc state in 1982 the role of the state and the impact that vbnc cells have on the environment have been under discussion the vbnc state is either considered to be a long term survival strategy of mostly gram negative bacteria with a specific program of differentiation or the vbnc state is seen as an injured state from which the cells may recover or possibly die bogosian and bourneuf 2001 ducret et al 2014 in this state bacteria stop growing on standard media but maintain certain characteristics of viable cells such as metabolic activity membrane integrity and most controversially discussed virulence oliver 2010 in the present study changes in the infectivity of six starved vbnc legionella strains were assessed at different timepoints over one year by using three host models the methodology used enabled us for the first time to semi quantitatively assess variations in the efficacy of legionella to cause infection as represented by the percentage of infected cells mois and the days in co culture required to observe an infection remarkably we demonstrated that several vbnc legionella strains can directly infect human macrophages one macrophage like cell differentiated from thp 1 cells and two primary human macrophages derived from peripheral blood monocytes even after one year of starvation in ultrapure water however these cells caused infection at a low percentage in comparison with culturable cells and required higher concentrations mois and longer time in co culture with the host models tested moreover the vbnc legionellae remained non culturable after passage through amoebae and thp 1 macrophages but recovered culturability after passage through human primary macrophages in contrast to most other studies of vbnc legionella cells in which only one legionella strain or only l pneumophila sg1 strains were studied ducret et al 2014 ohno et al 2003 steinert et al 2007 in the present study six different strains were investigated including four l pneumophila sg1 strains with environmental and clinical origins a l pneumophila sg6 strain and a l micdadei strain changes in the infectivity of each strain were analysed over two different time periods from the inoculation time up to 3 weeks after the total loss of culturability short term period and three to four extra timepoints for at least 100 days after the total loss of culturability long term period representing one of the longest studies performed with vbnc legionella under starvation conditions for the short term period in which the transition to the vbnc state was closely monitored the four l pneumophila sg1 strains regardless of the mab subtype helbig et al 2002 showed a similar infectivity pattern as long as culturable cells were present legionella cells infected amoebae and thp 1 macrophages at all mois including the lowest moi 1 after 1 4 days in co culture once non culturable three of the four l pneumophila sg1 strains sporadically infected amoebae but only at high mois 100 or 400 and required more than 7 days in co culture none of the strains infected thp 1 macrophages again during the short term period in a similar study with starved vbnc l pneumophila sg1 cells produced from two developmental states al bana et al 2014 detected amoebal infection only by vbnc cells produced from post exponential forms in tap water but not in ultrapure water using exclusively an moi of 1 in the same study no infection was observed in any of the co cultures of vbnc cells with u937 derived human macrophages l929 murine fibroblasts or human epithelial hela cells for the same moi al bana et al 2014 the use of higher mois may have resulted in higher infectivity rates the l micdadei strain remained culturable for the longest period of time the efficiency of infection of this strain decreased in parallel with its culturability requiring higher mois and longer time in co culture until one week before the total loss of culturability when the strain no longer infected any amoeba or thp 1 macrophages allegra et al 2008 observed in their study that l micdadei membranes were among the most resistant against thermal shock at 70 c thus differences in envelope composition might determine the distinct survival and infectivity of legionella species and even strains shevchuk et al 2011 in comparison lpsg6 which also remained culturable for a prolonged period of time infected amoebae throughout the experiment including both short and long time periods regardless of culturability but infected thp 1 macrophages only at timepoint 0 interestingly over the long term starvation period in which legionella was kept between 115 and 396 days in ultrapure water at 45 c several strains became infective again after a period in which no infections were observed the four l pneumophila sg1 strains infected amoebae at almost all the timepoints analysed for up to 396 days of starvation but mostly at an moi of 400 whereas these strains infected thp 1 macrophages only once at mois of 50 100 and 200 263 315 days of starvation these results are in agreement with those of steinert et al 1997 who studied the infectivity of a starved vbnc l pneumophila sg1 strain after 180 days in tap water microcosms using an moi of 0 1 steinert et al 1997 observed bacterial infection after only 24 h of co culture with amoebae at 37 c but did not observe similar results with human monocytes or in a guinea pig model in our study l micdadei never infected thp 1 macrophages but infected amoebae once after 221 days in ultrapure water at an moi of 400 all the strains studied required longer co culture times compared to timepoint 0 to observe an infection consequently culturable bacterial cells were the most effective in infecting amoebae and thp 1 macrophages because the total number of active cells was higher at the earlier timepoints analysed and because the active cells were healthier schrammel et al submitted in the long term starvation period two additional co culture models were implemented using primary monocyte derived macrophages m csf and gm csf macrophages our results showed that all legionella strains except l micdadei infected primary m csf and especially primary gm csf macrophages resembling tissue and alveolar macrophages respectively more often requiring generally shorter co culture times compared to the thp 1 macrophages that are less differentiated due to the leukemic nature of the parental thp 1 cells interestingly unlike what we observed in the previous co cultures some vbnc legionella strains regained their culturability after passage through m csf and gm csf macrophages in general resuscitation from the vbnc state is defined as the recovery of bacterial culturability in the media in which they were grown previously however in the case of legionella the recovery of culturability after the vbnc state has been mostly preceded by replication within amoebae epalle et al 2014 garcía et al 2007 steinert et al 1997 or as in the present study within macrophages for example ohno et al 2003 and steinert et al 1997 observed that starved vbnc legionella cells regained culturability after passage through amoebae however in the first study this recovery of culturability was observed in a minor proportion of the cells and only in one out of three serotypes interestingly in al bana et al 2014 l pneumophila regained culturability after passage through amoebae in 1 3 cells out of 105 starved vbnc cells produced in tap water but not in ultrapure water in our case recovery of culturability was only observed after passage through primary monocyte derived macrophages even though infective cells were observed in co culture with the other two host models thus the recovery of culturability is not straightforward and further research is needed to understand the mechanisms involved according to robertson et al 2014 the bacterial developmental form and different stressors trigger different types of vbnc cells this fact needs to be considered when comparing results with other studies several researchers such as garcía et al 2007 alleron et al 2008 and dusserre et al 2008 who have studied the impact of common disinfectants used in man made water systems as triggers that produce vbnc legionellae observed that vbnc l pneumophila infected amoebae however in a second study by alleron et al 2013 monochloramine triggered vbnc cells did not recover infectivity or culturability for the same amoeba strain even when the accumulation of some virulence related proteins was detected e g macrophage infectivity potentiator mip protein which is required in early stages of host cell infection following an approach closer to what might occur in the environment some researchers have tested the infectivity of vbnc legionellae toward human cells after passage through amoebae for example epalle et al 2014 found that heat generated vbnc l pneumophila were only infective for macrophage like or alveolar epithelial cells after previous interaction with a polyphaga and steinert et al 1997 only observed infection in human monocytes and in guinea pigs by starved vbnc l pneumophila after passage through a castellanii in the present study we showed that six vbnc legionella strains can directly infect primary monocyte derived macrophages after being under starvation conditions for 220 days at 45 c although small differences between strains were observed most of the strains infected macrophages after 3 days in co culture and some of the strains even went on to recover the culturability the experimental strategy to investigate vbnc cells at different timepoints and the use of different mois enabled us to monitor changes in the effectivity of infection over time in summary vbnc cell resuscitation culture and or infectivity may be dependent on the initial developmental stage of the cells al bana et al 2014 ohno et al 2003 the triggering stressor type dose etc robertson et al 2014 the degree of damage suffered oliver 2010 the host model used and the moi applied present study and may only be possible within a certain time window pinto et al 2015 on the one hand the behaviour of the vbnc legionella strains observed in the present study fits the microbial scout hypothesis epstein 2009 in which individual bacterial cells periodically and stochastically exit dormancy as a result of random events this could explain why lpenv suddenly infected amoebae after 277 and 396 days however when considering the infectivity patterns of all strains in co culture with amoebae and thp 1 macrophages we observed some trends that do not support such a theory for example one would have expected more sporadic legionella infections throughout the short term period in the two hosts tested larger differences between strains processed at the same time e g lpolda and lpclin or one strain being infective against all hosts at a certain timepoint e g lmic at day 221 one the other hand several authors demonstrated that asymmetrical aging and division stochasticity in gene expression and cell differentiation promote the formation of diverse sub populations in terms of morphology physiology and hypothetically virulence under identical environmental conditions ducret et al 2014 present study in the companion study by schrammel et al submitted we monitored the transition to the vbnc state of the six legionella strains presented here for one year by using a combination of different viability parameters including membrane integrity enzymatic activity esterase activity and global uptake of an essential amino acid indeed distinct legionella sub populations were identified as were distinct developmental phases of vbnc cell formation the biggest changes in terms of viability parameters until total loss of culturability were observed when analysing the number of highly esterase active cells which decreased between 1 5 and 3 log10 depending on the strain used once the strains were completely non culturable the number of highly esterase active cells remained stable close to the quantification limit of the parameter for up to more than 200 days of starvation considering the percentage of m csf and gm csf macrophages infected by starved vbnc legionella we could roughly estimate that between 7000 and 63 000 out of 1 108 cells ml 1 from the starvation microcosms remained infective after at least 221 days under such conditions these numbers correspond to a 1 3 2 log10 reduction in the number of infective cells compared to culturable cells the quantification limit for all viability parameters analysed by flow cytometry was 1 104 cells ml 1 therefore a relation between viability parameters and infectivity at the latter timepoints could not be determined on the other hand the subpopulation of cells with intact membranes was the most stable fraction among viable cell populations hence infectivity may be related to low esterase activity and the presence of cells with intact membranes legionellae are common inhabitants of engineered water systems where they live mostly associated with biofilms and the survival of legionellae is closely linked to the presence of free living amoebae legionellae not only survive amoebal digestion but also use the nutritional resources of the host to replicate within the host and persist in adverse environmental conditions and or in the presence of disinfectants cervero aragó et al 2015 fields et al 2002 nutrient depletion is the goal of many treatment strategies to limit biofilm formation in drinking water systems dws flemming et al 2016 thus dws are likely to have oligotrophic biofilms that contain starved vbnc legionellae standard surveillance of dws and outbreak investigations are commonly performed using culture based standard techniques in such cases the vbnc legionellae undetected would be an underestimation of the real number of active cells and the source of clinical cases of legionellosis might remain unknown although in the present study we observed that starved vbnc legionella infected amoebae primary human macrophages and thp 1 macrophages the legionellae did so with reduced efficacy because of the reduced number of active cells and because the remaining active cells were harmed in the starvation microcosms however it is known that passage through amoebae enhances legionella pathogenicity fields et al 2002 consequently if environmental conditions change after several passages through amoebae a pathogenic population of legionella that is likely to colonize dws may arise 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that several starved vbnc legionella strains including clinical and environmental l pneumophila sg1 strains an sg6 strain and a l micdadei strain can directly infect different primary human macrophage cell types thp 1 macrophages and amoebae even after one year of starvation in ultrapure water however they do so with reduced efficacy which is observed as lower percentages of infected cells prolonged co incubation periods and higher mois required whether these vbnc legionella populations can effectively infect human individuals in vivo and cause disease remains an open question in this hypothetical case potential negative culture results in spite of an ongoing pulmonary infection and difficulties in tracing the source of infection by culture based diagnostic techniques can be expected we also demonstrated that starved vbnc legionella cells infected amoebae consequently amoebae could act in oligotrophic biofilms as natural replicators of such cells that do or do not recover culturability in standard culture media further research is needed in order to improve vbnc legionella detection and enumeration techniques to avoid for example overestimating the performance of disinfection strategies applied and underestimating the risk that a dws may pose moreover more quantitative data regarding the infectivity of vbnc legionella is needed to feed the risk

19520,legionella infections are among the most important waterborne infections with constantly increasing numbers of cases in industrialized countries as a result of aging populations rising numbers of immunocompromised individuals and increased need for conditioned water due to climate change surveillance of water systems is based on microbiological culture based techniques however it has been shown that high percentages of the legionella populations in water systems are not culturable in the past two decades the relevance of such viable but non culturable vbnc legionellae has been controversially discussed and whether vbnc legionellae can directly infect human macrophages the primary targets of legionella infections remains unclear in this study it was demonstrated for the first time that several starved vbnc legionella strains four l pneumophila serogroup 1 strains a serogroup 6 strain and a l micdadei strain can directly infect different types of human macrophages and amoebae even after one year of starvation in ultrapure water however under these conditions the strains caused infection with reduced efficacy as represented by the lower percentages of infected cells prolonged time in co culture and higher multiplicities of infection required interestingly the vbnc cells remained mostly non culturable even after multiplication within the host cells amoebal infection by starved vbnc legionella which likely occurs in oligotrophic biofilms would result in an increase in the bacterial concentration in drinking water systems if cells remain in the vbnc state the real number of active legionellae will be underestimated by the use of culture based standard techniques thus further quantitative research is needed in order to determine whether and how many starved vbnc legionella cells are able to cause disease in humans graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella vbnc starvation acanthamoeba macrophages 1 introduction legionellae are mostly waterborne pathogenic gram negative bacteria that cause legionnaires disease ld and a milder form of infection known as pontiac fever fields et al 2002 in 2015 7034 notified cases of ld were reported in the european union norway iceland and switzerland ecdc 2017 of the culture confirmed cases 81 belonged to l pneumophila serogroup 1 ecdc 2017 however these numbers are unlikely to reflect the true incidence of ld in some countries due to the low notification rate in these countries leading to a high number of unreported cases ecdc 2017 von baum et al 2008 engineered water systems with elevated temperatures are common sources of legionellae associated with human disease bartram et al 2007 showers cooling towers hot and cold water distribution systems and air conditioning systems are frequently densely colonized by legionellae as part of naturally formed biofilms bartram et al 2007 it is in these biofilms that legionellae encounter free living amoebae fla which are the natural hosts of legionellae not only are fla facultative pathogens themselves visvesvara et al 2007 but they also play a very important role in aquatic ecosystems as predators of bacteria rodríguez zaragoza 1994 the co existence of fla and bacteria in the environment triggered the selection of grazing resistance strategies which influenced the pathogenesis of several bacterial genera amaro et al 2015 among these bacteria legionella spp not only evolved to resist amoebal digestion but also to exploit their hosts as nutrient sources and to replicate within the hosts fields et al 2002 moreover fla transform partially to extremely resistant cysts and can thus protect intracellular bacteria from disinfectants and other adverse environmental stressors cervero aragó et al 2015 dupuy et al 2011 thomas et al 2004 the transmission of legionellae occurs via the inhalation of small aerosols from improperly operated and monitored water systems once in the lungs the bacteria encounter another type of phagocytic cells namely alveolar macrophages legionella then use a very similar strategy to the one used within the amoebae to not only survive digestion but also replicate within the new host greub and raoult 2004 swanson and hammer 2000 thus humans are accidental hosts of legionella amaro et al 2015 ashbolt 2015 among the human populations elderly males and immunocompromised people are particularly susceptible ecdc 2017 in the aquatic environment exposure to stress can induce gram negative bacteria to enter the viable but non culturable vbnc state as a survival strategy oliver 2010 generally vbnc cells are viable cells that have lost their culturability in standard culture media but little is known regarding the physiological processes the underlying genetic or epigenetic regulation and the virulence of these cells kirschner 2016 different stressors that induce the transition of legionellae to the vbnc state have been described most important among these stressors are starvation schrammel et al submitted steinert et al 1997 chemical treatments such as chlorination garcía et al 2007 and heat allegra et al 2008 these vbnc cells have also been shown to potentially resuscitate regaining culturability via passage through amoebae ducret et al 2014 garcía et al 2007 steinert et al 1997 quantitative information has only been presented by al bana et al 2014 who reported that only one to three out of 100 000 starved vbnc cells were able to resuscitate in amoebae so far direct infection of human cells by vbnc legionellae or resuscitation from the vbnc state after contact with these cells has never been observed the aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the infectivity of six strains of vbnc legionellae during short term and long term starvation in ultrapure water in amoebae macrophages derived from the human monocytic cell line thp 1 and two primary human macrophage cell types in addition the recovery of culturability after host cell infection was analysed at the same time the transition from culture to the vbnc state and the vbnc state itself of the six legionella strains were monitored and characterized in detail for up to one year see companion paper schrammel et al submitted 2 material and methods 2 1 selected legionella strains in total six different legionella strains were used for the experiments four l pneumophila serogroup 1 sg1 strains were obtained from different sources l pneumophila sg1 mab subtype olda lpolda strain collection nctc 12008 public health england l pneumophila sg1 mab subtype france allentown isolated from an environmental source lpenv and l pneumophila sg1 subtype mab benidorm isolated from a clinical source lpclin both strains provided by a indra austrian agency for health and food safety vienna austria and l pneumophila sg1 mab subtype philadelphia lpparis provided by y héchard university of poitiers france the three latter strains belong to the most virulent mab 3 1 subtype according to the dresden panel helbig et al 2002 additionally we used one l pneumophila serogroup 6 strain lpsg6 strain collection nctc 11287 and a clinical l micdadei isolate lmic technical university dresden germany all strains were stored at 80 c in cryotubes rotistore carl roth karlsruhe germany 2 2 acanthamoeba culture acanthamoeba castellanii genotype t4 strain spa08 isolated from a keratitis patient pumidonming et al 2010 was chosen as a model system the strain was cultivated at room temperature on non nutrient agar nna plates previously coated with heat killed e coli axenic cultures and trophozoite sub cultures for infection assays were prepared as previously described dietersdorfer et al 2016 for co culturing axenic trophozoite suspensions of 1 105 amoeba cells ml 1 were transferred to 12 well cell culture plates plates were incubated at 30 c for 1 h to allow amoebal adherence to the bottoms of the wells then the peptone yeast glucose pyg medium was replaced with 1 ml of 1 10 pyg medium diluted in page s amoeba saline pas atcc1323 2 3 generation of thp 1 macrophages thp 1 a gift from alexandre m carmo instituto de biologia molecular e celular porto portugal is a human monocytic cell line derived from an acute monocytic leukaemia patient the cells were maintained in rpmi 1640 medium sigma aldrich steinheim germany supplemented with 100 μg ml 1 streptomycin 100 u ml 1 penicillin sigma aldrich and 10 fetal bovine serum fbs sigma aldrich in a humidified atmosphere with 5 co2 at 37 c the cells were counted and adjusted to a final concentration of 1 105 cells ml 1 using a hemocytometer then 1 ml of the cell suspension was transferred to a 12 well cell culture plate for the differentiation of thp 1 cells into macrophage like cells 50 ng ml 1 of phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate pma sigma aldrich was added and the cells were incubated for 72 h as described abdelhady and garduño 2013 differentiation was accompanied by increased cell adherence to the cell culture plastics and by upregulation of the cell surface antigens cd11b cd18 and cd87 which we monitored by flow cytometry as previously described machacek et al 2016 after 3 days the cells were washed twice with pre warmed phosphate buffered saline pbs finally 1 ml of fresh rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10 fbs without antibiotics was added to each well 2 4 generation of monocyte derived primary human macrophages peripheral blood leukocytes of healthy donors obtained from the blood bank of the medical university of vienna austria were separated into plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs and granulocytes with erythrocytes using lymphoprep gradient centrifugation axis shield oslo norway cd14 monocytes were further purified from pbmcs using cd14 macs microbeads miltenyi biotech bergisch gladbach germany and differentiated to macrophages with either 25 ng ml 1 recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor gm csf novartis basel switzerland or 50 ng ml 1 recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor m csf peprotech rocky hill nj as detailed elsewhere ohradanova repic et al 2016 after 7 days both types of differentiated macrophages were detached by trypsinization washed twice with pbs and resuspended in rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm l glutamine 5 fetal calf serum and 5 ng ml 1 gm csf or m csf then macrophages were seeded into 12 well plates at 1 105 cells well 1 and were left to recover for 24 h prior to infection assays 2 5 generation of starvation microcosms all legionella microcosms were prepared as explained in detail in our companion paper schrammel et al submitted briefly l pneumophila strains were grown in liquid buffered yeast extract broth libye modified from edelstein 1981 fifty millilitre tubes containing 7 5 ml of libye were inoculated with one bead from the cryoculture and incubated at 37 c at an angle of 45 under rotation at 150 rpm until the cells reached the stationary phase lpolda lpclin and lpsg6 73 h lpparis 103 h and lpenv 90 h fifty microliters of stationary phase culture were transferred into new 50 ml tubes with 7 5 ml of fresh libye under the same conditions for 47 h except for lpparis which took 63 h lmic was first grown on bcye plates biomerieux vienna austria at 37 c for 72 h three colonies from the plate were then transferred into libye and incubated like the other strains for 48 h stationary phase legionella cultures were then washed twice by centrifugation at 3500 g at 20 c supernatants were discarded and the cells were resuspended in ultrapure water by vortexing after checking the od600 value the volume required to achieve a legionella concentration of 1 108 cells ml 1 in 350 ml of autoclaved ultrapure water was inoculated into the starvation microcosms in sterile glass bottles for each strain three different microcosms originating from three different beads were prepared legionella microcosms were then incubated without shaking at 45 c and analysed at different time points for up to one year fig 1 2 6 experimental design the experiment was divided into short term and long term starvation periods for over one year fig 1 in the short term period all microcosms 3 bottles per legionellae strain were monitored from time 0 until complete loss of culturability followed by an additional two to three weeks for the l pneumophila sg1 strains five weeks in total in the case of lpsg6 and lmic 7 and 10 weeks respectively samples of each microcosm were taken once a week and co cultured with acanthamoeba castellanii and thp 1 macrophages in the long term starvation period a pooled sample of the 3 microcosm bottles per strain was co cultured with the same two hosts and with primary macrophages derived from human monocytes at 2 4 extra timepoints for up to one year in parallel culturability viability parameters amino acid uptake see schrammel et al submitted and the presence of outer membrane related virulence factors of legionella microcosms schrammel et al in preparation were also analysed fig 1 2 7 legionella culturability during starvation at each sampling timepoint the culturability of the starved legionella strains was analysed before and after co culture with the different hosts first tenfold dilution series of legionella microcosm samples were transferred to bcye buffered charcoal yeast extract agar plates without antibiotics biomerieux vienna austria then once an ongoing infection was confirmed by microscopy see section 2 8 1 ml of co culture suspension was directly plated on bcye agar all plates were incubated at 37 c for at least 10 days and checked every 3 4 days for growth of legionella colonies 2 8 infection of amoebae thp 1 macrophages and monocyte derived primary human macrophages for the short term starvation period three legionella starvation microcosms per strain were analysed in parallel for the long term period a pool of the three replicates per strain was used every bacterial suspension was directly added to amoeba and macrophage cultures prepared as explained above at different multiplicities of infection moi 1 50 100 and 400 legionellae per amoeba 1 10 50 100 and 200 legionellae per thp 1 macrophages and 50 and 100 legionellae per primary human macrophage cell type to enhance the interaction between legionellae and host cells the plates were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min in the case of amoebae and at 300 g for 5 min in the case of thp 1 macrophages amoeba co cultures were then incubated at 30 c while co cultures with human cells were incubated at 37 c in a 5 co2 atmosphere 2 9 monitoring of legionella infections co cultures were observed daily by using an inverted microscope olympus ck 2 vienna austria when the host cells showed any sign of infection intracellular replication of legionella cells the cells from the corresponding well were harvested samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min 300 g for macrophage co cultures the supernatant was discarded and 10 μl of the suspension was transferred onto a 10 well teflon coated slide medco health solutions inc münchen germany which were dried at 37 c for 30 min samples were then fixed in 20 μl of 4 paraformaldehyde in pbs for 10 min at room temperature washed twice with pbs and dehydrated for 3 min in an aqueous ethanol series 50 80 and 96 l pneumophila cells were then stained using the monofluo l pneumophila ifa test kit bio rad laboratories inc redmont usa dietersdorfer et al 2016 l micdadei lmic cells were stained by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish

staining solution was added to the fixed cells on the slides and the slides were incubated in a humid chamber in the dark at 46 c for 2 h then the slides were washed in pre warmed washing buffer 2 15 ml of 5 mol l 1 nacl 1 ml of 1 mol l 1 tris hcl and 0 5 ml of 0 5 mol l 1 edta filled to a volume of 50 ml with ultrapure water for 15 min at 48 c in a water bath subsequently the slides were briefly dipped into 80 ethanol and dried in the dark the slides were mounted with dapi mix 40 μl of 50 μg ml 1 dapi 1540 μl of citifluor hatfield pennsylvania usa 280 μl of vectashield vector laboratories inc peterborough uk and 140 μl of pbs for counterstaining finally all slides were observed using a nikon eclipse 8000 epifluorescence microscope and images were captured by using a nikon ds qimc camera and nis elements br 2 3 software nikon the cells were considered to be infected when vesicles of more than five legionella bright cells were observed within the host cells co cultures of hosts without bacteria were used as negative controls andfresh legionella suspensions prepared as described above were used as positive controls slides with stained primary monocyte derived macrophage co cultures were used to calculate the percentage of infected hosts in relation to the total number of host cells 3 results 3 1 infectivity of short term starved vbnc legionella in amoebae and thp 1 macrophages the time required to observe the total loss of culturability i e approximately 8 log10 reduction in the number of colony forming units was dependent on the legionella strain investigated fig 2 more details in schrammel et al submitted all l pneumophila sg1 strains lost their culturability within 14 days lpsg6 and lmic lost their culturability after 4 and 8 weeks respectively likewise the infectivity patterns of the legionellae strongly depended on the respective strains and differences between hosts were observed all legionella strains were able to replicate within amoebae at least as long as the strains were culturable at all mois tested fig 2 with the exception of lmic which became non infectious shortly before total loss of culturability and lpsg6 which infected amoebae at all timepoints analysed at timepoint 0 vesicles of replicating bacteria within amoebae were already observable for all l pneumophila sg1 strains within 24 h of co culture after one week of starvation it was observed that the time in co culture until replication was prolonged to 4 days after total loss of culturability four out of the five l pneumophila strains lpolda lpclin lpparis and lpsg6 further infected the amoebae during the short term starvation period infectious vbnc lpolda lpparis and lpclin cells were observed only for the highest mois 50 and 100 and only at day 28 and day 35 of starvation requiring long co culturing times of 7 22 days lpsg6 remained infective until the end of the short term starvation period up to 49 days for different mois requiring 2 3 days for the highest mois tested 100 and 400 and 7 days for the lowest mois 1 and 50 in co culture with amoebae fig 2 all l pneumophila sg 1 strains replicated within thp 1 macrophages at least as long as culturable cells were present lpsg6 although still culturable only infected thp 1 macrophages right after inoculation in ultrapure water timepoint 0 lmic similar to the results of the amoeba co culture stopped infecting thp 1 macrophages shortly before the total loss of culturability after 7 weeks of starvation for all six strains no thp 1 macrophages infection was observed after the legionella strains lost their culturability in the short term period none of the vbnc legionella strains regained their culturability after co culture with the two host models used not even after passage through the host cells fig 2 3 2 infectivity of long term starved vbnc legionellae in amoeba and thp 1 macrophages the infectivity of long term starved vbnc legionella cells was studied by pooling the triplicate samples of the starvation microcosms all legionella strains infected amoebae at least at one timepoint after more than 115 days of starvation figs 2 and 3 lpolda infected amoebae after 115 197 and 315 days in ultrapure water but only at mois of 100 and 400 replication in the host cells was already visible after 3 7 days at each timepoint of the long term starvation period lpclin replicated in amoebae only at the highest moi 400 after 3 8 days in co culture lpparis and lpenv were infective after 277 344 only lpparis and 396 days of starvation only at the higher mois after 4 8 days in co culture after 126 221 and 273 days of starvation and at high mois lpsg6 also replicated in amoebae and was the only strain that remained infective in amoebae at each time point tested throughout the experiment with a small increase in the time in co culture required to observe infection throughout the long time period lmic infected amoebae only after 221 days at an moi of 400 figs 2 and 3 all l pneumophila sg1 strains infected thp 1 macrophages during the long term starvation period but only at single timepoints however neither lpsg6 nor lmic caused infection interestingly vbnc lpolda and lpclin cells infected thp 1 macrophages only after 263 days of starvation for the three mois tested 50 100 and 400 the time required to observe the infection ranged from 3 to 7 days lpenv and lpparis infected thp 1 macrophages only after 344 days of starvation lpparis infected thp 1 macrophages after 3 7 days at all three mois tested and lpenv infected thp 1 macrophages after 7 days only at an moi of 100 figs 2 and 3 as observed in the short term period even after positive infection events none of the vbnc legionella strains regained their culturability in the long term starvation period fig 2 3 3 infectivity of long term starved vbnc legionellae in monocyte derived primary human macrophages thp 1 macrophages due to the leukaemic monocytic nature of the parental thp 1 cells are an excellent model for generating high numbers of macrophage like cells however these cells have a limitation because we do not know which natural macrophage type they most closely resemble therefore to get one step closer to an in vivo model we differentiated human peripheral blood monocytes with either m csf or gm csf to generate primary human macrophages resembling either tissue or alveolar macrophages respectively patel et al 2017 co cultures with these monocyte derived primary human macrophages were performed at three timepoints for the long term starved vbnc legionellae figs 3 and 4 overall legionella strains were more infective on gm csf macrophages than on m csf macrophages lpolda infected gm csf macrophages after 200 263 and 315 days of starvation at mois of 50 and 100 whereas the same strain infected m csf macrophages only at the two last timepoints at the highest mois lpclin infected gm csf macrophages after 200 and 263 days of starvation and m csf macrophages only after 263 days lpenv lpparis and lpsg6 infected both macrophage cell types at all the timepoints tested lmic infected m csf macrophages only after 221 days of starvation but never infected gm csf macrophages figs 3 and 4 the time required to observe legionella infections in gm csf and m csf macrophage co cultures ranged between 3 and 8 days regardless of the primary macrophage cell type used interestingly unlike what was observed in the previous co cultures some vbnc legionella strains regained their culturability after passage through m csf and gm csf macrophages fig 4 colonies of lpenv on bcye plates were observed after infection of gm csf macrophages after 281 days of starvation lpparis regained culturability after infecting both cell types after 344 days of starvation and after 221 days of starvation lmic grew on bcye plates after passage through m csf macrophages 3 4 estimation of the number of starved vbnc legionellae that caused infection in primary monocyte derived macrophages in an attempt to estimate the number of starved vbnc legionellae that caused infection in primary monocyte derived macrophages the percentage of infected m csf and gm csf macrophages in relation to the total number of macrophages per well was calculated table 1 percentages in each co culture were calculated by counting at least 200 macrophages per well per moi and per timepoint in the co culture analysed such estimations were only made for primary macrophages because these macrophages are the closest model to an in vivo situation and almost all the strains infected these macrophages at all the timepoints analysed in spite of the limitations of the methodology used such as different starvation timepoints or different days in co culture a general trend could be observed culturable cells of lpclin and lpparis were used as positive controls the two strains infected approximately 62 of gm csf macrophages and 43 of m csf macrophages at an moi of 50 right after inoculation in ultrapure water in contrast after at least 221 days of starvation the six legionella strains replicated in 0 7 4 6 of gm csf macrophages and in 0 9 6 3 of m csf macrophages at an moi of 100 requiring at least 3 days in co culture table 1 for an moi of 100 1 107 legionella cells ml 1 were added to 1 105 host cells ml 1 assuming that one legionella cell is enough to cause an infection we can calculate that between 700 and 6300 starved vbnc legionella cells out of 1 107 cells ml 1 remained infective in primary macrophages after at least 221 days under starvation conditions compared to 40 000 and 65 000 out of 5 106 cells ml 1 of culturable legionella cells supplementary information 4 discussion since the discovery of the vbnc state in 1982 the role of the state and the impact that vbnc cells have on the environment have been under discussion the vbnc state is either considered to be a long term survival strategy of mostly gram negative bacteria with a specific program of differentiation or the vbnc state is seen as an injured state from which the cells may recover or possibly die bogosian and bourneuf 2001 ducret et al 2014 in this state bacteria stop growing on standard media but maintain certain characteristics of viable cells such as metabolic activity membrane integrity and most controversially discussed virulence oliver 2010 in the present study changes in the infectivity of six starved vbnc legionella strains were assessed at different timepoints over one year by using three host models the methodology used enabled us for the first time to semi quantitatively assess variations in the efficacy of legionella to cause infection as represented by the percentage of infected cells mois and the days in co culture required to observe an infection remarkably we demonstrated that several vbnc legionella strains can directly infect human macrophages one macrophage like cell differentiated from thp 1 cells and two primary human macrophages derived from peripheral blood monocytes even after one year of starvation in ultrapure water however these cells caused infection at a low percentage in comparison with culturable cells and required higher concentrations mois and longer time in co culture with the host models tested moreover the vbnc legionellae remained non culturable after passage through amoebae and thp 1 macrophages but recovered culturability after passage through human primary macrophages in contrast to most other studies of vbnc legionella cells in which only one legionella strain or only l pneumophila sg1 strains were studied ducret et al 2014 ohno et al 2003 steinert et al 2007 in the present study six different strains were investigated including four l pneumophila sg1 strains with environmental and clinical origins a l pneumophila sg6 strain and a l micdadei strain changes in the infectivity of each strain were analysed over two different time periods from the inoculation time up to 3 weeks after the total loss of culturability short term period and three to four extra timepoints for at least 100 days after the total loss of culturability long term period representing one of the longest studies performed with vbnc legionella under starvation conditions for the short term period in which the transition to the vbnc state was closely monitored the four l pneumophila sg1 strains regardless of the mab subtype helbig et al 2002 showed a similar infectivity pattern as long as culturable cells were present legionella cells infected amoebae and thp 1 macrophages at all mois including the lowest moi 1 after 1 4 days in co culture once non culturable three of the four l pneumophila sg1 strains sporadically infected amoebae but only at high mois 100 or 400 and required more than 7 days in co culture none of the strains infected thp 1 macrophages again during the short term period in a similar study with starved vbnc l pneumophila sg1 cells produced from two developmental states al bana et al 2014 detected amoebal infection only by vbnc cells produced from post exponential forms in tap water but not in ultrapure water using exclusively an moi of 1 in the same study no infection was observed in any of the co cultures of vbnc cells with u937 derived human macrophages l929 murine fibroblasts or human epithelial hela cells for the same moi al bana et al 2014 the use of higher mois may have resulted in higher infectivity rates the l micdadei strain remained culturable for the longest period of time the efficiency of infection of this strain decreased in parallel with its culturability requiring higher mois and longer time in co culture until one week before the total loss of culturability when the strain no longer infected any amoeba or thp 1 macrophages allegra et al 2008 observed in their study that l micdadei membranes were among the most resistant against thermal shock at 70 c thus differences in envelope composition might determine the distinct survival and infectivity of legionella species and even strains shevchuk et al 2011 in comparison lpsg6 which also remained culturable for a prolonged period of time infected amoebae throughout the experiment including both short and long time periods regardless of culturability but infected thp 1 macrophages only at timepoint 0 interestingly over the long term starvation period in which legionella was kept between 115 and 396 days in ultrapure water at 45 c several strains became infective again after a period in which no infections were observed the four l pneumophila sg1 strains infected amoebae at almost all the timepoints analysed for up to 396 days of starvation but mostly at an moi of 400 whereas these strains infected thp 1 macrophages only once at mois of 50 100 and 200 263 315 days of starvation these results are in agreement with those of steinert et al 1997 who studied the infectivity of a starved vbnc l pneumophila sg1 strain after 180 days in tap water microcosms using an moi of 0 1 steinert et al 1997 observed bacterial infection after only 24 h of co culture with amoebae at 37 c but did not observe similar results with human monocytes or in a guinea pig model in our study l micdadei never infected thp 1 macrophages but infected amoebae once after 221 days in ultrapure water at an moi of 400 all the strains studied required longer co culture times compared to timepoint 0 to observe an infection consequently culturable bacterial cells were the most effective in infecting amoebae and thp 1 macrophages because the total number of active cells was higher at the earlier timepoints analysed and because the active cells were healthier schrammel et al submitted in the long term starvation period two additional co culture models were implemented using primary monocyte derived macrophages m csf and gm csf macrophages our results showed that all legionella strains except l micdadei infected primary m csf and especially primary gm csf macrophages resembling tissue and alveolar macrophages respectively more often requiring generally shorter co culture times compared to the thp 1 macrophages that are less differentiated due to the leukemic nature of the parental thp 1 cells interestingly unlike what we observed in the previous co cultures some vbnc legionella strains regained their culturability after passage through m csf and gm csf macrophages in general resuscitation from the vbnc state is defined as the recovery of bacterial culturability in the media in which they were grown previously however in the case of legionella the recovery of culturability after the vbnc state has been mostly preceded by replication within amoebae epalle et al 2014 garcía et al 2007 steinert et al 1997 or as in the present study within macrophages for example ohno et al 2003 and steinert et al 1997 observed that starved vbnc legionella cells regained culturability after passage through amoebae however in the first study this recovery of culturability was observed in a minor proportion of the cells and only in one out of three serotypes interestingly in al bana et al 2014 l pneumophila regained culturability after passage through amoebae in 1 3 cells out of 105 starved vbnc cells produced in tap water but not in ultrapure water in our case recovery of culturability was only observed after passage through primary monocyte derived macrophages even though infective cells were observed in co culture with the other two host models thus the recovery of culturability is not straightforward and further research is needed to understand the mechanisms involved according to robertson et al 2014 the bacterial developmental form and different stressors trigger different types of vbnc cells this fact needs to be considered when comparing results with other studies several researchers such as garcía et al 2007 alleron et al 2008 and dusserre et al 2008 who have studied the impact of common disinfectants used in man made water systems as triggers that produce vbnc legionellae observed that vbnc l pneumophila infected amoebae however in a second study by alleron et al 2013 monochloramine triggered vbnc cells did not recover infectivity or culturability for the same amoeba strain even when the accumulation of some virulence related proteins was detected e g macrophage infectivity potentiator mip protein which is required in early stages of host cell infection following an approach closer to what might occur in the environment some researchers have tested the infectivity of vbnc legionellae toward human cells after passage through amoebae for example epalle et al 2014 found that heat generated vbnc l pneumophila were only infective for macrophage like or alveolar epithelial cells after previous interaction with a polyphaga and steinert et al 1997 only observed infection in human monocytes and in guinea pigs by starved vbnc l pneumophila after passage through a castellanii in the present study we showed that six vbnc legionella strains can directly infect primary monocyte derived macrophages after being under starvation conditions for 220 days at 45 c although small differences between strains were observed most of the strains infected macrophages after 3 days in co culture and some of the strains even went on to recover the culturability the experimental strategy to investigate vbnc cells at different timepoints and the use of different mois enabled us to monitor changes in the effectivity of infection over time in summary vbnc cell resuscitation culture and or infectivity may be dependent on the initial developmental stage of the cells al bana et al 2014 ohno et al 2003 the triggering stressor type dose etc robertson et al 2014 the degree of damage suffered oliver 2010 the host model used and the moi applied present study and may only be possible within a certain time window pinto et al 2015 on the one hand the behaviour of the vbnc legionella strains observed in the present study fits the microbial scout hypothesis epstein 2009 in which individual bacterial cells periodically and stochastically exit dormancy as a result of random events this could explain why lpenv suddenly infected amoebae after 277 and 396 days however when considering the infectivity patterns of all strains in co culture with amoebae and thp 1 macrophages we observed some trends that do not support such a theory for example one would have expected more sporadic legionella infections throughout the short term period in the two hosts tested larger differences between strains processed at the same time e g lpolda and lpclin or one strain being infective against all hosts at a certain timepoint e g lmic at day 221 one the other hand several authors demonstrated that asymmetrical aging and division stochasticity in gene expression and cell differentiation promote the formation of diverse sub populations in terms of morphology physiology and hypothetically virulence under identical environmental conditions ducret et al 2014 present study in the companion study by schrammel et al submitted we monitored the transition to the vbnc state of the six legionella strains presented here for one year by using a combination of different viability parameters including membrane integrity enzymatic activity esterase activity and global uptake of an essential amino acid indeed distinct legionella sub populations were identified as were distinct developmental phases of vbnc cell formation the biggest changes in terms of viability parameters until total loss of culturability were observed when analysing the number of highly esterase active cells which decreased between 1 5 and 3 log10 depending on the strain used once the strains were completely non culturable the number of highly esterase active cells remained stable close to the quantification limit of the parameter for up to more than 200 days of starvation considering the percentage of m csf and gm csf macrophages infected by starved vbnc legionella we could roughly estimate that between 7000 and 63 000 out of 1 108 cells ml 1 from the starvation microcosms remained infective after at least 221 days under such conditions these numbers correspond to a 1 3 2 log10 reduction in the number of infective cells compared to culturable cells the quantification limit for all viability parameters analysed by flow cytometry was 1 104 cells ml 1 therefore a relation between viability parameters and infectivity at the latter timepoints could not be determined on the other hand the subpopulation of cells with intact membranes was the most stable fraction among viable cell populations hence infectivity may be related to low esterase activity and the presence of cells with intact membranes legionellae are common inhabitants of engineered water systems where they live mostly associated with biofilms and the survival of legionellae is closely linked to the presence of free living amoebae legionellae not only survive amoebal digestion but also use the nutritional resources of the host to replicate within the host and persist in adverse environmental conditions and or in the presence of disinfectants cervero aragó et al 2015 fields et al 2002 nutrient depletion is the goal of many treatment strategies to limit biofilm formation in drinking water systems dws flemming et al 2016 thus dws are likely to have oligotrophic biofilms that contain starved vbnc legionellae standard surveillance of dws and outbreak investigations are commonly performed using culture based standard techniques in such cases the vbnc legionellae undetected would be an underestimation of the real number of active cells and the source of clinical cases of legionellosis might remain unknown although in the present study we observed that starved vbnc legionella infected amoebae primary human macrophages and thp 1 macrophages the legionellae did so with reduced efficacy because of the reduced number of active cells and because the remaining active cells were harmed in the starvation microcosms however it is known that passage through amoebae enhances legionella pathogenicity fields et al 2002 consequently if environmental conditions change after several passages through amoebae a pathogenic population of legionella that is likely to colonize dws may arise 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that several starved vbnc legionella strains including clinical and environmental l pneumophila sg1 strains an sg6 strain and a l micdadei strain can directly infect different primary human macrophage cell types thp 1 macrophages and amoebae even after one year of starvation in ultrapure water however they do so with reduced efficacy which is observed as lower percentages of infected cells prolonged co incubation periods and higher mois required whether these vbnc legionella populations can effectively infect human individuals in vivo and cause disease remains an open question in this hypothetical case potential negative culture results in spite of an ongoing pulmonary infection and difficulties in tracing the source of infection by culture based diagnostic techniques can be expected we also demonstrated that starved vbnc legionella cells infected amoebae consequently amoebae could act in oligotrophic biofilms as natural replicators of such cells that do or do not recover culturability in standard culture media further research is needed in order to improve vbnc legionella detection and enumeration techniques to avoid for example overestimating the performance of disinfection strategies applied and underestimating the risk that a dws may pose moreover more quantitative data regarding the infectivity of vbnc legionella is needed to feed the risk assessment models and predict the risk of acquiring legionellosis from vbnc cells funding information this study was supported by the austrian science fund fwf project p24535 b22 the austrian federal

19521,rice is the main staple carbohydrate source for billions of people worldwide natural geogenic and anthropogenic sources has led to high arsenic as concentrations in rice grains this is because as is highly bioavailable to rice roots under conditions in which rice is cultivated a multifaceted and interdisciplinary understanding both of short term and long term effects are required to identify spatial and temporal changes in as contamination levels in paddy soil water systems during flooding soil pore waters are elevated in inorganic as compared to dryland cultivation systems as anaerobism results in poorly mobile as v being reduced to highly mobile as iii the formation of iron fe plaque on roots availability of metal hydro oxides fe and mn organic matter clay mineralogy and competing ions and compounds po4 3 and si oh 4 are all known to influence as v and as iii mobility in paddy soil water environments microorganisms play a key role in as transformation through oxidation reduction and methylation volatilization reactions but transformation kinetics are poorly understood scientific based optimization of all biogeochemical parameters may help to significantly reduce the bioavailability of inorganic as graphical abstract image keywords irrigation water geogenic arsenic redox chemistry arsenic speciation metal hydro oxides arsenic accumulation 1 introduction around the world many countries have levels of arsenic as present that are of concern to the environment abedin et al 2002a bissen and frimmel 2003 the united states environmental protection agency usepa classifies inorganic as as a group a carcinogen iarc 2004 long term chronic exposure to inorganic as in humans causes cancers i e skin lung kidney liver and bladder along with cardiovascular neurological hematological renal and respiratory diseases furthermore it is a root cause of diabetes mellitus damage to dna proteins and lipids and as significant affects on the intellectual development of children johnson et al 2010 melak et al 2014 sharma et al 2014 as a consequence of the chronic toxicological effects of as recommended and regulatory limits established by various authorities have been revised the world health organization s who permissible level for total as in drinking water was decreased in 1993 from 50 to 10 μg l 1 who 1993 followed by the usepa in 2001 usepa 2001 arsenic tends to accumulate in higher concentrations in some food items most notably rice oryza sativa l lin et al 2015 rahman and hasegawa 2011 rice is the staple food for approximately three billion people predominantly in asia supplying 70 and 50 of their energy and protein needs respectively according to laborte et al 2017 115 countries worldwide produce rice with about half of the countries in asia having 2 3 cropping seasons whereas african latin american and the caribbean countries have a maximum of two seasons per annum rice production in all temperate regions is restricted to one season per year with peak rice planting months in each season differing between countries laborte et al 2017 paddy rice is managed to ensure a standing head of water above the soil and includes a plowing to homogenize waterlogged top soils b maintaining a standing head of water in the fields during the cropping period and c water drained and soil allowed to dry out before harvest winkler et al 2016 flooding and draining are used to manage the redox chemistry of the paddy soil water environment arsenic builds up in paddy soil water through natural i e rock weathering and alluvial deposits processes the use of as contaminated groundwater to irrigate rice additionally causes a build up of as jia et al 2015 sofuoglu et al 2014 the food and agricultural organization fao recommends that total as in irrigation water should be under 100 μg l 1 mining of ag au cu pb w and zn and associated activities can lead to as contamination of neighboring paddies buschmann et al 2007 fitzmaurice et al 2009 zhu et al 2008 other sources of as in paddy soils are from phosphate po4 3 based fertilizers cattle manures and use of arsenical based pesticides on cotton rice rotations meharg and zhao 2012 the european union eu has established the maximum limit for as in agricultural soils as 20 mg kg 1 in this review we explore the current understanding of as dynamics in rice paddy ecosystems discussing the temporal and spatial distributions of as in paddy soil water environments with respect to physico chemical properties of the soil furthermore the role of microbiome on as mobility and transformation between different arsenic species in paddy soil water will be assessed 2 arsenic speciation and its association with physico chemical properties 2 1 ph and eh arsenic exists in the environment in several oxidation states i e 3 0 3 and 5 and occurs in both solid and liquid phases however it rarely exists in nature in its native state as 0 or as as 3 wang and mulligan 2006 in groundwater with a typical ph range of 6 5 8 5 as tends to readily mobilize in paddy soil pore waters as is mainly present in its inorganic form as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite as iii or pentavalent arsenate as v with the most common organic as species being monomethylarsonic acid mma v and dimethylarsinic acid dma v which are generally present at lower concentrations campbell and nordstrom 2014 keller et al 2014 ahmed et al 2011 found that soil ph is positively correlated with total as concentration in rice grains this is because high ph induces negative surface charges which may promote the desorption of as iii and as v into the soil solution redox potential eh determines the speciation mobility and bioavailability of as species under oxidizing conditions arsenic acid h3aso4 is a dominant species at low ph 2 whereas h2aso4 and haso4 2 are predominant at ph ranges of 2 11 bissen and frimmel 2003 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 when reduction conditions develop arsenious acid h3aso3 is prominent and is converted into h2aso3 at lower ph and haso3 2 for higher ph levels 12 different mechanisms such as the reductive dissolution of metal hydro oxides formation of root plaques and microbial mediated reduction and oxidation are all factors in as speciation in the paddy environment smedley and kinniburgh 2002 2 2 organic matter organic carbon derived from decomposed plant and animal products plays an important role in as dynamics in the paddy environment tareq et al 2013 in rice farming organic matter is often added to soil in the form of manure in most cases rice stubble and roots are incorporated back into paddy fields after harvest said pullicino et al 2016 such practice will lead to the formation of dissolved organic carbon doc in paddy soils accentuated under flooded conditions organic matter has a high affinity with as leading to the formation of organo as complexes paikaray et al 2005 radloff et al 2007 williams et al 2011 rahaman et al 2011 demonstrated that the combined amendment of lathyrus vermicompost and poultry manure into as contaminated paddy soils decreased total as concentration in rice tissues similarly fu et al 2011 observed that soil organic matter levels exhibited a close negative correlation with total as concentration in rice grains however doc can be adsorbed onto fe iii hydro oxides feooh via ligand exchange and subsequently compete with both as iii and as v for active adsorption sites as a result doc found in the soil solution may enhance both as iii and as v mobility and bioavailability mladenov et al 2015 in addition doc stimulates fe iii reducing bacteria promoting microbial feooh reduction and leading to the release of as iii into the soil solution chen et al 2016 mladenov et al 2009 2 3 clay mineralogy clay minerals such as kaolinite montmorillonite and illite are primarily formed due to the weathering of rocks by physical chemical and biological factors regmi et al 2013 wimpenny et al 2014 a lower eh developed under flooded conditions leads to enhanced flocculation and dispersion of clay particles in this regard clay minerals migrate into the bottom of the ploughed layer and form a plough pan li et al 1997 mechanical manipulation by farmers animals and heavy machinery also promote the plough pan formation repeated tilling over many years increases the micropores 0 2 μm instead of mesopores and macropores in the plough pan therefore water retention capacity in ploughed layers is enhanced kögel knabner et al 2010 increased water retention is an important consideration in order to minimize irrigation water requirements particularly those with as contamination the presence of clay minerals leads to finer textured soils with a relatively high surface area feooh is mainly incorporated in the clay size soil fraction and therefore clay soils may promote both as iii and as v retention in paddy soils sahoo and kim 2013 surface runoff due to the heavy rainfall and the subsequent destruction of soil structure through ploughing is responsible for the loss of clay minerals during paddy cultivation kögel knabner et al 2010 and has a negative impact on as immobilization 2 4 redox sensitive ions 2 4 1 iron iron chemistry plays an important role in determining the as iii and as v mobility in paddy soils eq 1 and eq 2 pan et al 2014 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 paddy soils may contain feooh minerals such as ferrihydrite goethite lepidocrocite and hematite in addition the formation of fe plaque under flooded conditions leads to sequestered as species discussed in detail in section 3 2 both as v and as iii can be adsorbed or can co precipitate at the oxic anoxic boundary of feooh which has a large specific surface area i e ferrihydrite 100 700 m2 g 1 goethite 8 200 m2 g 1 lepidocrocite 15 260 m2 g 1 hematite 2 115 m2 g 1 the ligand exchange between inorganic as species and oh2 and oh in coordination spheres of fe atoms facilitates the sorption process jain et al 1999 in this regard feooh decreases as iii and as v bioavailability for rice plants youngran et al 2007 1 f e o h s a s o 3 a q 3 3 h a q f e h 2 a s o 3 s h 2 o l 2 f e o h s a s o 4 a q 3 3 h a q f e h 2 a s o 4 s h 2 o l as mentioned above reductive dissolution of feooh increases as iii mobility in paddy soil water systems huang et al 2012 yamaguchi et al 2011 therefore rice plants are more likely to be susceptible to enhanced as accumulation when compared to other cereal crops overall agronomic practices lead to changes in the fe chemistry in paddy soils and indirectly affect as mobility and distribution 2 4 2 manganese manganese oxide minerals interact with as speciation in paddy environments being an electron acceptor during the oxidation process manganese oxides have the ability to decrease as mobility in paddy soil water in two ways oxidizing as iii to as v and by adsorbing as v eq 3 and eq 4 lafferty et al 2011 for example phyllomanganates one of the most notable layered mn oxides can readily oxidize as iii to as v manning et al 2002 tani et al 2004 demonstrated that some microorganisms could act to catalyze the manganese oxide induction of as iii oxidation manganese plaque in rice roots also sequesters as therefore there is often an inverse correlation between total as in rice tissue and the mn level in paddy soils hossain et al 2008 3 m n o 2 s h 3 a s o 3 a q 2 h a q m n a q 2 h 3 a s o 4 a q h 2 o l 4 2 m n o h s h 3 a s o 4 a q m n o 2 a s o o h s 2 h 2 o l 2 4 3 sulfur sulfate so4 2 in the soil matrix reduces into sulfide s2 as the redox potential decreases from 120 to 180 mv during flooded conditions microbial so4 2 reduction also plays an important role in determining as mobility in paddy soils jia et al 2015 wilkin et al 2003 sulfate reduction to s2 results in immobilization of as iii due to the precipitation of as iii as arsenic sulfide and iron sulfide minerals burton et al 2014 fisher et al 2007 however only limited studies have focused on so4 2 and inorganic as interactions in paddy soils burton et al 2014 demonstrated that microbial so4 2 reduction leads to lower concentrations of both fe ii and as iii in flooded soil owing to mackinawite formation and as iii co precipitation whereas as iii sorption onto iron sulfide depends upon as speciation in aqueous media and iron sulfide mineralogy jönsson and sherman 2008 moreover under flooded conditions as iii can react with s2 and form aqueous thioarsenite complexes which may precipitate as as s solid phases i e amorphous as2s3 or ass bostick et al 2005 typically thioarsenite complexes are formed under low fe ii and high organic matter environments however thioarsenite complexes are not commonly found in paddy soils 2 5 other competing ions and compounds the presence of competing anions such as po4 3 influences as mobility and bioavailability in paddy soils sharma et al 2014 phosphate an analogue to as v affects as v mobilization by desorbing as v associated with soil mineral particles or adsorbed onto soil surfaces cao et al 2003 fitz and wenzel 2002 similarly silicic acid si oh 4 competes with as iii for binding sites on mineral phases in paddy soils and influences as iii concentrations in soil pore water however silicon si fertilization as sio2 of as contaminated paddy soil has shown both negative and positive effects on rice plants silicic acid can compete with as iii for retention sites on soil mineral surfaces and consequently increase the as iii concentration in the soil solution as a result rice plants may acquire high concentrations of as iii however li et al 2009 demonstrated that sio2 application greater than the recommended rate decreased the as iii uptake in rice plants this is because both si oh 4 and as iii are acquired by the same transporter osnip2 1 lsi1 in rice plant and higher sio2 application promotes the si oh 4 uptake rather than as iii 3 arsenic dynamics in the paddy environment natural and anthropogenic sources contribute to as distribution in a paddy environment table 1 summarizes the main causes i e as contaminated irrigation water industrial waste wastewater discharges mining activities and natural geogenic sources for as introduction into the paddy environment and total as concentrations in paddy soils in as affected rice cultivation regions around the world in the following subsections the main causes that introduce as into paddy ecosystems are discussed in detail fig 1 illustrates key features and reactions in as contaminated paddy soil water systems at different stages of the rice growth cycle 3 1 geogenic as elevation geogenic sources such as rock weathering and alluvial deposits lead to contaminate paddy soils with as however limited studies have focused on geogenic as accumulation in the paddy environment table 1 weathering of as bearing minerals such as bearsite be2 aso4 oh 8h2o wallisite cu ag tlpbas2s5 and claudetite as2o3 are largely responsible for as in paddy soils in manipur india eq 5 chandrashekhar et al 2016 such minerals lead to relatively high total concentrations of as in paddy soils for example total as concentrations in paddy soils in manipur india ranged between 50 and 90 mg kg 1 5 a s 2 o 3 s 3 h 2 o l 2 h a 3 s o 3 a q it is therefore important to investigate the geological background in and around paddy environments to identify possible primary and secondary as bearing minerals the solubility constants for respective minerals different greatly from each other and are dependent upon various physico chemical and biological factors arsenic in loosely bound fractions primarily in the bioavailable fraction and redox sensitive phases are vulnerable to release as into the paddy soil solution fu et al 2011 hsu et al 2012 alluvial deposition of sediments is also responsible for long distance transport of as from point sources to floodplain paddy fields hundal et al 2013 found that alluvial soils collected from north west india released as iii from a soil water suspension under flooded conditions therefore paddy environments located along the floodplains and near as bearing mineral deposits are required to be investigated for possible as accumulation affects 3 2 effect of as contaminated irrigation water rice plant yield is mostly dependent on the water type used for irrigation over the respective growth cycle to prepare the land for rice planting approximately 150 200 mm of water is added however this figure may extend up to 900 mm of water in some instances bouman and tuong 2001 throughout the growing season 3 months a volume of between 500 and 3000 mm of water is needed and this figure differs with climatic conditions soil type and rice genotypes abedin et al 2002b when dry conditions exist water losses are relatively high and paddy soils become partially or completely dry rice cultivation in dryer periods is dependent on the available surface water i e river pond lake dam or groundwater sources surface water sources are largely safe from as contamination sharma et al 2014 however mineral weathering and anthropogenic activities such as industrial discharge and municipal solid waste dump sites may add inorganic and organic as species into surface water liu et al 2007 zheng et al 2015 due to a lack of accessibility and poor infrastructure development most farmers in rice producing localities have to depend on the readily available groundwater sources brammer 2009 in this regard as contaminated groundwater is extensively used in the form of irrigation water in many rice producing countries table 2 as a result paddy soils can be easily contaminated with as over time and in some instances the total as level in soil exceeds the recommended level for agricultural purposes table 1 therefore most researchers have mainly paid attention to as accumulation in paddy soils with as contaminated irrigation water dittmar et al 2007 huang et al 2016 rahman et al 2010 aquifer chemistry is an important aspect in determining as concentrations in groundwater especially for as impacted aquifer regions table 2 well depth differs from region to region and does not necessarily show a close correlation with as concentrations in groundwater table 2 groundwater tables tend to fluctuate during the year due to the large differences between rainfall and extensive withdrawal as a result oxygen reacts with as bearing minerals i e pyrite fes2 and arsenopyrite feass to release as eqs 6 and 7 fakhreddine et al 2015 sun et al 2016 the reduction of feooh under reducing conditions also releases as iii into the groundwater eq 8 xie et al 2015 iron iii reducing microorganisms also enhance the reduction of feooh to release as iii therefore the combination of natural processes together with human involvement lead to the introduction of inorganic as species into rice cultivating areas through groundwater irrigation 6 2 f e s 2 s

groundwater is usually fed by channels into paddy fields kabir et al 2016 polizzotto et al 2013 when as contaminated groundwater is used for irrigation typically a gradient in total as concentration in paddy soil water is observed high concentrations found near the channel inlet tapering down to relatively low levels at significant distances dittmar et al 2007 panaullah et al 2009 however a number of studies have demonstrated that flow velocity has a close relationship with as concentrations in the irrigation water along the irrigation channel at a slower flow velocity aggregation and subsequent settling of as bearing colloids occur due to the long residence time therefore slower flow velocity leads to a gradual decrease in total as concentrations observed along the irrigation channel fig 2 dittmar et al 2007 roberts et al 2007 in contrast a faster flow velocity has a short residence time which restricts the aggregation and subsequent settling down of as bearing colloids along the irrigation channels in this regard total as concentrations in irrigation water along the irrigation channel remains relatively unchanged at higher operating flow velocities dittmar et al 2007 roberts et al 2007 the type of irrigation channel i e man made concrete channel or soil clay ditch channel also change the total as concentration found in irrigation water along the channel length to a greater extent neumann et al 2014 chemical changes can also lead to decreased total as concentrations observed along irrigation channels most studies have focused on the total as concentration rather than as speciation as iii and as v in irrigation water however limited studies revealed that as iii which represents the majority of total as in groundwater gradually decreases as it travels along irrigation channels the rationale for this is that diffusion of atmospheric o2 into the irrigation water may oxidize as iii into as v reactive intermediates i e fe iv species formed during fe ii oxidation by o2 may also partly oxidize as iii into as v roberts et al 2004 as the irrigation water flows through the irrigation channel dissolved fe ii and mn ii are oxidized by diffused atmospheric o2 and consequently precipitated as fe oh 3 and mno2 dittmar et al 2007 the complexation and co precipitation of as v with metal hydro oxides i e fe and mn further reduce the total as concentrations found along irrigation channels fig 2 total as concentration further decreases once the irrigation water enters the paddy field for a range of different reasons it is obvious that once irrigation water comes into the paddy field that water flow rate across the paddy field will significantly decrease as a result colloid settling and as adsorption onto mineral particles takes place polizzotto et al 2013 demonstrated that total as concentration dropped by almost 50 of initial well water concentrations once irrigation water first entered the fields located only 40 m from the irrigation well when paddy fields were in static or standing conditions after being completely filled with irrigation water dissolved total as concentrations declined across the fields exhibiting little lateral variation within 4 h after irrigation polizzotto et al 2013 moreover as input with irrigation water mainly accumulates on top soil i e the root zone of the rice plants table 1 possibly due mainly to the oxidation adsorption and co precipitation of as species the paddy soil is submerged flooded for a long period of time out of the growing cycle and consequently undergoes a number of physico chemical reactions the water replaces the gaseous phase in the soil pores resulting in a decrease of eh for a flooded environment a number of redox reactions from high eh 700 mv to low eh 300 mv aerobic respiration nitrification denitrification mn iv reduction fe iii reduction so4 2 reduction and methanogenesis mainly governed by microorganisms occurs either sequentially or simultaneously during this period sahrawat 2015 if the paddy soil is initially acidic the ph of the soil tends to increase during the flooded conditions as reduction processes consume protons the reverse is true for alkaline paddy soils since co2 induces mineralization triggers of acidification sahrawat 2015 arsenic speciation and distribution in flooded and non flooded conditions during rice growth is a completely different process soil pore water contains higher concentrations of total as fe and mn than the irrigation water under flooded conditions in addition as iii as v ratios in the soil solution and submerged soil increase over time during the flooded period takahashi et al 2004 as stated above the development of a lower eh value in submerged paddy soils is the main reason for such results garnier et al 2010 assessed the changes in eh in paddy soil profile 0 20 cm during the rice growth cycle over 3 months from paddy soil preparation through to rice harvesting they found that the eh value had decreased along the soil profile with only slight variations except for a depth of 7 cm where less reduced conditions were observed possibly due to micro aeration by rice plant roots formation of root plaques greatly influence as mobility and bioavailability in paddy soil water systems with fe and mn co existing in rice root plaques liu et al 2005b however fe is the main element followed by mn in the plaques since feooh precipitates at lower eh levels than mn oxides therefore most of the previous studies have mainly focused on as species sequestration onto fe plaques in rice roots iron plaque mainly consists of ferrihydrite goethite and lepidocrocite violante et al 2003 radial oxygen loss rol which is the phenomenon releasing o2 into the rhizosphere through the root aerenchyma promotes fe plaque formation even though flooded conditions exist eq 9 colmer 2002 9 4 f e a q 2 3 o 2 g 6 h 2 o l 4 f e o h 3 s since rol depends on plant anatomy i e root porosity and root density and growth stage the amount of fe plaque on rice roots varies among rice genotypes liu et al 2004 mei et al 2009 violante et al 2003 indigenous fe levels in paddy soil systems also plays a key role in determining the amount of root plaque to be formed therefore a rice genotype grown in paddy soils with high fe concentration could have higher amounts of fe plaque than the same rice genotype grown in paddy soils with low fe concentrations iron plaque has high affinity with both as v and as iii hence fe plaque directly reduces the total as concentration in the paddy soil water systems and subsequently in rice plants external supplementation of fooh to paddy soils has been found to have positive effects on fe plaque formation suda et al 2016 yun et al 2016b one of the main drawbacks related to fe plaque is that the high density of fe plaque on rice roots may restrict the diffusion of o2 into the rhizosphere for this reason rhizospheric microorganisms associated with rice plant growth and health promotion may be adversely affected fe precipitation could also further hinder the nutrient uptake by rice roots ultra et al 2009 therefore a detailed investigation is required to further assess the role of fe plaque on the immobilization of as species in the rice plant growth cycle another important concern regarding the total as accumulation in paddy soils is interpretation of the total as content extent with respect to irrigation water i e mass balance calculations different studies have revealed that usage of as contaminated irrigation water in the concentration range of 100 400 μg l 1 leads to accumulation of total as in top paddy soil at a rate of 1 0 1 6 mg kg 1 y 1 dittmar et al 2007 martin et al 2007 meharg and rahman 2003 therefore long term studies are required to assess how loosely bound as fractions behave over time in addition as accumulation predictions can vary for many different reasons arsenic in paddy soil can also be removed through various different processes as mentioned earlier paddy fields which are subjected to seasonal flooding due to high rainfall remove a large amount of as roberts et al 2010 estimated that seasonal flooding removes 13 62 of as added to the paddy soils through irrigation each year in addition rapid as transfer below the plow pan i e a depth of approximately 20 25 cm may enhance preferential flow paths e g soil cracks formed under dry condition and mouse burrows dittmar et al 2007 evapotranspiration might also concentrate as in the soil solution on a short term basis but the link between evapotranspiration and as concentrations in paddy soil water system has not been comprehensively evaluated 3 3 effect of mining activities paddy soils can be contaminated by as if mining activities are active in close proximity to paddy fields table 1 so far a limited number of studies has reported the effects of mining on as contamination in paddy soils and there is no reporting thus far on as speciation dynamics in mining impacted paddy soils throughout the growth stage of rice plants mining of as bearing minerals i e arsenopyrite pyrite realgar ass and orpiment as2s3 and accompanied secondary as minerals are responsible for as contamination in paddy soils tailings and waste rocks acid mine drainage and wet and dry deposition of dust due to high rainfall and strong winds are responsible for as accumulation in rice fields in the vicinity of mining areas kwon et al 2017 yun et al 2016a china is the world s largest rice producer and is the best example for mining related as in paddy fields for instance long term mining activities in hunan province one of the largest rice producing regions in china led to high total as concentrations in adjacent paddy soils table 1 the pattern of the total as distribution in rice soils through mining operations varies due to different parent materials patel et al 2005 total as concentrations in paddy soils in hainan island china ranged between 0 1 and 45 9 mg kg 1 depending on the different rock types metamorphic rocks 18 9 45 9 mg kg 1 acid igneous rocks and basalt 0 1 5 9 and 0 2 4 2 mg kg 1 clastic sediments 0 4 10 9 mg kg 1 fu et al 2011 however total as concentrations in mining impacted paddy soils cannot provide sufficient information regarding the mobility and bioavailability of as therefore the associated environmental risks are to be required to be accessed focusing on speciation levels chemical fractionation through sequential extraction methods provides detailed information on as in paddy soils farooq et al 2010 fu et al 2011 hsu et al 2012 norra et al 2005 paddy soils affected by mining activities can have a higher percentage of residual phase as than the easily mobile phase and redox sensitive phases of as fig 3 arsenic binding to residual phases can only be released by strong environmental changes i e strong acids therefore the residual bound fraction is more stable than those loosely bound phases and redox sensitive phases however paddy soils contaminated with as contaminated irrigation water have a different story on chemical fractionation those soils have a higher concentration of as retained in loosely bound phases and redox sensitive phases whereas only the lowest concentration of as is associated with residual phases fig 3 accumulation of as in paddy soils due to as rich groundwater is primarily due to its co precipitation with or sorption onto poorly crystalline metal hydro oxides or other components such as crystalline metal hydro oxides clay minerals and organic matter of the soil matrix in contrast paddy soils contaminated with mining operations mainly contain residual bound as which limits both the mobility and bioavailability of as 4 role of microorganisms on as dynamics in paddy soil water systems aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms are in paddy soils involved in the as speciation through different processes zhang et al 2015b fig 4 illustrates the variety of direct as transformation pathways governed by microorganisms in paddy soil water systems 4 1 arsenic oxidation and reduction microorganisms inhabiting in the rhizosphere and bulk paddy soil are responsible for both as oxidation and reduction a range of genes present in microorganisms are encoded for as transformation enzymes and transporters zecchin et al 2017b microbial oxidation of as iii to as v which is less toxic and less mobile than as iii is considered as a detoxification mechanism of microorganisms coded for by the aioa gene zhang et al 2015b microbial oxidation of as iii takes place in both flooded and non flooded conditions in paddy soils paracoccus species can oxidize as iii under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in paddy soil by using o2 and no3 as the respective electron acceptor zhang et al 2015a in addition as iii acts as an electron donor during the bacterial metabolism zheng et al 2013 once abiotic oxidation of as iii ceases due to passivation of reactive sites on the mineral surfaces microbiologically mediated as iii oxidation becomes prevalent in non flooded paddy soil even though the rate of conversion of as iii to as v is a slow process around 2 5 2 8 per day dong et al 2014 as iii oxidizing bacteria enhance plant growth promoting pgp substances for example a gram positive bacterium bacillus flexus aso 6 isolated from the rhizosphere of rice paddy plants showed elevated rates of as iii oxidation vmax 1 34 μm min 1 10 7 cell and had secreted plant growth promoting substances such as siderophores indole 3 acetic acid iaa and 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylate acc deaminase das et al 2016b therefore inoculation of as iii oxidizing bacteria is beneficial to not only minimize the as burden but also to promote growth in rice plants microorganisms are able to reduce as v to as iii in paddy soils mainly under flooded conditions two different pathways namely as detoxification and the respiratory pathway coded for by the arsc and arra genes respectively are involved in as v reduction malasarn et al 2004 villegas torres et al 2011 phylogenetically diverse bacteria can reduce as v to as iii even under non flooded conditions bachate et al 2009 microbial reduction of as v to more mobile as iii under both flooded and non flooded conditions may also enhance the as mobility and bioavailability in the paddy environment apart from direct as transformations microorganisms could indirectly govern the as speciation in paddy soil water systems for instance fe iii reducing and fe ii oxidizing bacteria play an important role in as transformation zecchin et al 2017b the relative abundance of fe iii reducing bacteria is high in continuous ﬂooded conditions therefore the reduction of fe iii minerals and consequent release of as iii is expected to be high under flooded conditions ohtsuka et al 2013 the application of soil amendments such as biochar may influence as v reduction wang et al 2017 the biochar can stimulate the growth and abundance of fe iii reducing bacterial growth i e clostridium bacillus and caloramator to facilitate as v reduction wang et al 2017 unfavorable low concentrations of fe ii and high levels of fe iii may also decrease the activity and abundance of fe iii reducing bacteria in paddy soils however little is known about the microbial community responsible for fe ii oxidation nitrate dependent fe ii oxidizing bacteria in flooded paddy soils can oxidize fe ii to fe iii arsenic species may precipitate or adsorb onto fe iii minerals in root plaque and bulk soils under such conditions dong et al 2016 as already stated in section 2 4 3 so4 2 reducing and so4 2 oxidizing bacteria could also influence as speciation in paddy soil water systems overall water management practices i e flooded and non flooded conditions together with physico chemical and environmental factors greatly determine the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in paddy soil systems zecchin et al 2017a 2017b for example the relative abundance of as fe and s reducing bacteria is increased under flooded conditions and the reverse is true under non flooded conditions das et al 2016a zecchin et al 2017a however there is no detailed report on microbial mediated as oxidation reduction kinetics and related rate limiting factors which may also slow down the reactions 4 2 arsenic methylation and volatilization microorganisms including bacteria fungi eukaryotic algae and archaea are mainly responsible for the conversion of inorganic as iii into methylated as species the microbial gene for as iii methylation arsm that encodes for as processing leads to the formation of mono di tri and tetra methyl as species wang et al 2014 zhao et al 2013 several factors contribute to the as methylation process under flooded conditions first increased diversity and activities of anaerobic microorganisms second extended flooded conditions for as iii transformation and increased substrate availability for as methylation third the reductive dissolution of metal hydro oxides desorb already sorbed methylated as species i e mma v and dma v into the soil solution rice plants are unable to methylate inorganic as in vivo therefore methylated as species present in rice may come through microbial mediated methylation in the rhizosphere lomax et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 arsenic volatilization from paddy environments accounted for 0 9 2 6 of global as emissions into the atmosphere mestrot et al 2011a it has been estimated that paddy soils contribute 419 1252 t of as emissions annually which is about 15 45 and 3 10 fold greater than the as emissions from sea spray and forest fires respectively mestrot et al 2011b zheng et al 2013 microorganisms are capable of volatilizing inorganic as to arsines fig 4 primarily as trimethylarsines tmas ch3 3as with low quantities of arsine ash3 monomethylarsine meash2 ch3 ash2 dimethylarsine me2ash ch3 2ash jia et al 2012 mestrot et al 2011a after volatilization tmas is rapidly oxidized by atmospheric o2 into trimethylarsine oxide tmas v o bhattacharya et al 2007 since as volatilization is strictly governed by microbial activities the rate and efficiency of as volatilization can be induced through the biostimulation promoting microbial activities and bioaugmentation inoculation of microbes processes chen et al 2017 total as concentration in soil pore water showed a positive correlation with total released arsines jia et al 2012 mestrot et al 2011a initial conversion of as iii to mma v determines the rate of arsines volatilization from paddy soils in this respect mma v and dma v application into paddy soil have shown an increase in yearly arsines volatilization rate of 3 5 mestrot et al 2011a 5 conclusions the distribution of as species in paddy soil water is obviously heterogeneous in space both laterally and vertically and varies over time it is clear that total as concentration in paddy soil water does not reflect the measurement from a single point and therefore an accurate understanding of spatial and temporal distribution of as species is essential the key knowledge gaps have been identified and are required to be addressed in future studies more importantly the consequence of natural geogenic sources i e weathering of as bearing minerals and alluvial deposits with respect to paddy soil as loadings needs more consideration a detailed investigation of soil mineralogy in areas under rice cultivation is essential the following aspects are also important 1 assessing the rate limiting factors i e physico chemical parameters on as speciation mobility and bioavailability 2 investigation of element levels for fe mn and s which are direct influences on as speciation and mobility at paddy soil profile levels 3 study the levels of ions and compounds po4 3 and si oh 4 that compete with inorganic as species for adsorption sites and influenced as species uptake by rice roots 4 identify key microorganisms and their mechanisms with regards to as speciation in paddy soil water 5 determination of how as biotransformation kinetics are regulated by different microorganisms 6 investigation of rice genotype variations in root plaque formation and as speciation in the rhizosphere moreover perturbed environmental conditions such as more frequent flooding acid rain and global warming may change the as dynamics in the paddy environment therefore impacts of extreme environmental conditions on as speciation and the mobility of rice ecosystems should be further explored scientific based knowledge on as dynamics in paddy ecosystems is important to design management practices to decrease as uptake into rice grain since water management practices mainly change the biogeochemical processes in paddy soil water systems aerobic and intermittent irrigation water management practices rather than the conventional irrigation management long period of flooded condition and short period of non flooded condition may decrease as levels in paddy soil pore water external supplementation of fe mn and s into the as contaminated paddy environments could immobilize inorganic as species through promotion of root plaque formation complexation and precipitation similarly incorporation of po4 3 and si oh 4 into the as contaminated rice fields may reduce as species uptake by rice roots however secondary contamination could be a major drawback related to the above amendments biostimulation by providing nutrients required for microbial growth may decrease as toxicity in paddy environments due to the enhancement of microbial mediated processes including as oxidation methylation and volatilization breeding and introduction of rice cultivars that decrease grain as accumulation would be another option and this area of research may prove fruitful 
19521,rice is the main staple carbohydrate source for billions of people worldwide natural geogenic and anthropogenic sources has led to high arsenic as concentrations in rice grains this is because as is highly bioavailable to rice roots under conditions in which rice is cultivated a multifaceted and interdisciplinary understanding both of short term and long term effects are required to identify spatial and temporal changes in as contamination levels in paddy soil water systems during flooding soil pore waters are elevated in inorganic as compared to dryland cultivation systems as anaerobism results in poorly mobile as v being reduced to highly mobile as iii the formation of iron fe plaque on roots availability of metal hydro oxides fe and mn organic matter clay mineralogy and competing ions and compounds po4 3 and si oh 4 are all known to influence as v and as iii mobility in paddy soil water environments microorganisms play a key role in as transformation through oxidation reduction and methylation volatilization reactions but transformation kinetics are poorly understood scientific based optimization of all biogeochemical parameters may help to significantly reduce the bioavailability of inorganic as graphical abstract image keywords irrigation water geogenic arsenic redox chemistry arsenic speciation metal hydro oxides arsenic accumulation 1 introduction around the world many countries have levels of arsenic as present that are of concern to the environment abedin et al 2002a bissen and frimmel 2003 the united states environmental protection agency usepa classifies inorganic as as a group a carcinogen iarc 2004 long term chronic exposure to inorganic as in humans causes cancers i e skin lung kidney liver and bladder along with cardiovascular neurological hematological renal and respiratory diseases furthermore it is a root cause of diabetes mellitus damage to dna proteins and lipids and as significant affects on the intellectual development of children johnson et al 2010 melak et al 2014 sharma et al 2014 as a consequence of the chronic toxicological effects of as recommended and regulatory limits established by various authorities have been revised the world health organization s who permissible level for total as in drinking water was decreased in 1993 from 50 to 10 μg l 1 who 1993 followed by the usepa in 2001 usepa 2001 arsenic tends to accumulate in higher concentrations in some food items most notably rice oryza sativa l lin et al 2015 rahman and hasegawa 2011 rice is the staple food for approximately three billion people predominantly in asia supplying 70 and 50 of their energy and protein needs respectively according to laborte et al 2017 115 countries worldwide produce rice with about half of the countries in asia having 2 3 cropping seasons whereas african latin american and the caribbean countries have a maximum of two seasons per annum rice production in all temperate regions is restricted to one season per year with peak rice planting months in each season differing between countries laborte et al 2017 paddy rice is managed to ensure a standing head of water above the soil and includes a plowing to homogenize waterlogged top soils b maintaining a standing head of water in the fields during the cropping period and c water drained and soil allowed to dry out before harvest winkler et al 2016 flooding and draining are used to manage the redox chemistry of the paddy soil water environment arsenic builds up in paddy soil water through natural i e rock weathering and alluvial deposits processes the use of as contaminated groundwater to irrigate rice additionally causes a build up of as jia et al 2015 sofuoglu et al 2014 the food and agricultural organization fao recommends that total as in irrigation water should be under 100 μg l 1 mining of ag au cu pb w and zn and associated activities can lead to as contamination of neighboring paddies buschmann et al 2007 fitzmaurice et al 2009 zhu et al 2008 other sources of as in paddy soils are from phosphate po4 3 based fertilizers cattle manures and use of arsenical based pesticides on cotton rice rotations meharg and zhao 2012 the european union eu has established the maximum limit for as in agricultural soils as 20 mg kg 1 in this review we explore the current understanding of as dynamics in rice paddy ecosystems discussing the temporal and spatial distributions of as in paddy soil water environments with respect to physico chemical properties of the soil furthermore the role of microbiome on as mobility and transformation between different arsenic species in paddy soil water will be assessed 2 arsenic speciation and its association with physico chemical properties 2 1 ph and eh arsenic exists in the environment in several oxidation states i e 3 0 3 and 5 and occurs in both solid and liquid phases however it rarely exists in nature in its native state as 0 or as as 3 wang and mulligan 2006 in groundwater with a typical ph range of 6 5 8 5 as tends to readily mobilize in paddy soil pore waters as is mainly present in its inorganic form as oxyanions of trivalent arsenite as iii or pentavalent arsenate as v with the most common organic as species being monomethylarsonic acid mma v and dimethylarsinic acid dma v which are generally present at lower concentrations campbell and nordstrom 2014 keller et al 2014 ahmed et al 2011 found that soil ph is positively correlated with total as concentration in rice grains this is because high ph induces negative surface charges which may promote the desorption of as iii and as v into the soil solution redox potential eh determines the speciation mobility and bioavailability of as species under oxidizing conditions arsenic acid h3aso4 is a dominant species at low ph 2 whereas h2aso4 and haso4 2 are predominant at ph ranges of 2 11 bissen and frimmel 2003 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 when reduction conditions develop arsenious acid h3aso3 is prominent and is converted into h2aso3 at lower ph and haso3 2 for higher ph levels 12 different mechanisms such as the reductive dissolution of metal hydro oxides formation of root plaques and microbial mediated reduction and oxidation are all factors in as speciation in the paddy environment smedley and kinniburgh 2002 2 2 organic matter organic carbon derived from decomposed plant and animal products plays an important role in as dynamics in the paddy environment tareq et al 2013 in rice farming organic matter is often added to soil in the form of manure in most cases rice stubble and roots are incorporated back into paddy fields after harvest said pullicino et al 2016 such practice will lead to the formation of dissolved organic carbon doc in paddy soils accentuated under flooded conditions organic matter has a high affinity with as leading to the formation of organo as complexes paikaray et al 2005 radloff et al 2007 williams et al 2011 rahaman et al 2011 demonstrated that the combined amendment of lathyrus vermicompost and poultry manure into as contaminated paddy soils decreased total as concentration in rice tissues similarly fu et al 2011 observed that soil organic matter levels exhibited a close negative correlation with total as concentration in rice grains however doc can be adsorbed onto fe iii hydro oxides feooh via ligand exchange and subsequently compete with both as iii and as v for active adsorption sites as a result doc found in the soil solution may enhance both as iii and as v mobility and bioavailability mladenov et al 2015 in addition doc stimulates fe iii reducing bacteria promoting microbial feooh reduction and leading to the release of as iii into the soil solution chen et al 2016 mladenov et al 2009 2 3 clay mineralogy clay minerals such as kaolinite montmorillonite and illite are primarily formed due to the weathering of rocks by physical chemical and biological factors regmi et al 2013 wimpenny et al 2014 a lower eh developed under flooded conditions leads to enhanced flocculation and dispersion of clay particles in this regard clay minerals migrate into the bottom of the ploughed layer and form a plough pan li et al 1997 mechanical manipulation by farmers animals and heavy machinery also promote the plough pan formation repeated tilling over many years increases the micropores 0 2 μm instead of mesopores and macropores in the plough pan therefore water retention capacity in ploughed layers is enhanced kögel knabner et al 2010 increased water retention is an important consideration in order to minimize irrigation water requirements particularly those with as contamination the presence of clay minerals leads to finer textured soils with a relatively high surface area feooh is mainly incorporated in the clay size soil fraction and therefore clay soils may promote both as iii and as v retention in paddy soils sahoo and kim 2013 surface runoff due to the heavy rainfall and the subsequent destruction of soil structure through ploughing is responsible for the loss of clay minerals during paddy cultivation kögel knabner et al 2010 and has a negative impact on as immobilization 2 4 redox sensitive ions 2 4 1 iron iron chemistry plays an important role in determining the as iii and as v mobility in paddy soils eq 1 and eq 2 pan et al 2014 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 paddy soils may contain feooh minerals such as ferrihydrite goethite lepidocrocite and hematite in addition the formation of fe plaque under flooded conditions leads to sequestered as species discussed in detail in section 3 2 both as v and as iii can be adsorbed or can co precipitate at the oxic anoxic boundary of feooh which has a large specific surface area i e ferrihydrite 100 700 m2 g 1 goethite 8 200 m2 g 1 lepidocrocite 15 260 m2 g 1 hematite 2 115 m2 g 1 the ligand exchange between inorganic as species and oh2 and oh in coordination spheres of fe atoms facilitates the sorption process jain et al 1999 in this regard feooh decreases as iii and as v bioavailability for rice plants youngran et al 2007 1 f e o h s a s o 3 a q 3 3 h a q f e h 2 a s o 3 s h 2 o l 2 f e o h s a s o 4 a q 3 3 h a q f e h 2 a s o 4 s h 2 o l as mentioned above reductive dissolution of feooh increases as iii mobility in paddy soil water systems huang et al 2012 yamaguchi et al 2011 therefore rice plants are more likely to be susceptible to enhanced as accumulation when compared to other cereal crops overall agronomic practices lead to changes in the fe chemistry in paddy soils and indirectly affect as mobility and distribution 2 4 2 manganese manganese oxide minerals interact with as speciation in paddy environments being an electron acceptor during the oxidation process manganese oxides have the ability to decrease as mobility in paddy soil water in two ways oxidizing as iii to as v and by adsorbing as v eq 3 and eq 4 lafferty et al 2011 for example phyllomanganates one of the most notable layered mn oxides can readily oxidize as iii to as v manning et al 2002 tani et al 2004 demonstrated that some microorganisms could act to catalyze the manganese oxide induction of as iii oxidation manganese plaque in rice roots also sequesters as therefore there is often an inverse correlation between total as in rice tissue and the mn level in paddy soils hossain et al 2008 3 m n o 2 s h 3 a s o 3 a q 2 h a q m n a q 2 h 3 a s o 4 a q h 2 o l 4 2 m n o h s h 3 a s o 4 a q m n o 2 a s o o h s 2 h 2 o l 2 4 3 sulfur sulfate so4 2 in the soil matrix reduces into sulfide s2 as the redox potential decreases from 120 to 180 mv during flooded conditions microbial so4 2 reduction also plays an important role in determining as mobility in paddy soils jia et al 2015 wilkin et al 2003 sulfate reduction to s2 results in immobilization of as iii due to the precipitation of as iii as arsenic sulfide and iron sulfide minerals burton et al 2014 fisher et al 2007 however only limited studies have focused on so4 2 and inorganic as interactions in paddy soils burton et al 2014 demonstrated that microbial so4 2 reduction leads to lower concentrations of both fe ii and as iii in flooded soil owing to mackinawite formation and as iii co precipitation whereas as iii sorption onto iron sulfide depends upon as speciation in aqueous media and iron sulfide mineralogy jönsson and sherman 2008 moreover under flooded conditions as iii can react with s2 and form aqueous thioarsenite complexes which may precipitate as as s solid phases i e amorphous as2s3 or ass bostick et al 2005 typically thioarsenite complexes are formed under low fe ii and high organic matter environments however thioarsenite complexes are not commonly found in paddy soils 2 5 other competing ions and compounds the presence of competing anions such as po4 3 influences as mobility and bioavailability in paddy soils sharma et al 2014 phosphate an analogue to as v affects as v mobilization by desorbing as v associated with soil mineral particles or adsorbed onto soil surfaces cao et al 2003 fitz and wenzel 2002 similarly silicic acid si oh 4 competes with as iii for binding sites on mineral phases in paddy soils and influences as iii concentrations in soil pore water however silicon si fertilization as sio2 of as contaminated paddy soil has shown both negative and positive effects on rice plants silicic acid can compete with as iii for retention sites on soil mineral surfaces and consequently increase the as iii concentration in the soil solution as a result rice plants may acquire high concentrations of as iii however li et al 2009 demonstrated that sio2 application greater than the recommended rate decreased the as iii uptake in rice plants this is because both si oh 4 and as iii are acquired by the same transporter osnip2 1 lsi1 in rice plant and higher sio2 application promotes the si oh 4 uptake rather than as iii 3 arsenic dynamics in the paddy environment natural and anthropogenic sources contribute to as distribution in a paddy environment table 1 summarizes the main causes i e as contaminated irrigation water industrial waste wastewater discharges mining activities and natural geogenic sources for as introduction into the paddy environment and total as concentrations in paddy soils in as affected rice cultivation regions around the world in the following subsections the main causes that introduce as into paddy ecosystems are discussed in detail fig 1 illustrates key features and reactions in as contaminated paddy soil water systems at different stages of the rice growth cycle 3 1 geogenic as elevation geogenic sources such as rock weathering and alluvial deposits lead to contaminate paddy soils with as however limited studies have focused on geogenic as accumulation in the paddy environment table 1 weathering of as bearing minerals such as bearsite be2 aso4 oh 8h2o wallisite cu ag tlpbas2s5 and claudetite as2o3 are largely responsible for as in paddy soils in manipur india eq 5 chandrashekhar et al 2016 such minerals lead to relatively high total concentrations of as in paddy soils for example total as concentrations in paddy soils in manipur india ranged between 50 and 90 mg kg 1 5 a s 2 o 3 s 3 h 2 o l 2 h a 3 s o 3 a q it is therefore important to investigate the geological background in and around paddy environments to identify possible primary and secondary as bearing minerals the solubility constants for respective minerals different greatly from each other and are dependent upon various physico chemical and biological factors arsenic in loosely bound fractions primarily in the bioavailable fraction and redox sensitive phases are vulnerable to release as into the paddy soil solution fu et al 2011 hsu et al 2012 alluvial deposition of sediments is also responsible for long distance transport of as from point sources to floodplain paddy fields hundal et al 2013 found that alluvial soils collected from north west india released as iii from a soil water suspension under flooded conditions therefore paddy environments located along the floodplains and near as bearing mineral deposits are required to be investigated for possible as accumulation affects 3 2 effect of as contaminated irrigation water rice plant yield is mostly dependent on the water type used for irrigation over the respective growth cycle to prepare the land for rice planting approximately 150 200 mm of water is added however this figure may extend up to 900 mm of water in some instances bouman and tuong 2001 throughout the growing season 3 months a volume of between 500 and 3000 mm of water is needed and this figure differs with climatic conditions soil type and rice genotypes abedin et al 2002b when dry conditions exist water losses are relatively high and paddy soils become partially or completely dry rice cultivation in dryer periods is dependent on the available surface water i e river pond lake dam or groundwater sources surface water sources are largely safe from as contamination sharma et al 2014 however mineral weathering and anthropogenic activities such as industrial discharge and municipal solid waste dump sites may add inorganic and organic as species into surface water liu et al 2007 zheng et al 2015 due to a lack of accessibility and poor infrastructure development most farmers in rice producing localities have to depend on the readily available groundwater sources brammer 2009 in this regard as contaminated groundwater is extensively used in the form of irrigation water in many rice producing countries table 2 as a result paddy soils can be easily contaminated with as over time and in some instances the total as level in soil exceeds the recommended level for agricultural purposes table 1 therefore most researchers have mainly paid attention to as accumulation in paddy soils with as contaminated irrigation water dittmar et al 2007 huang et al 2016 rahman et al 2010 aquifer chemistry is an important aspect in determining as concentrations in groundwater especially for as impacted aquifer regions table 2 well depth differs from region to region and does not necessarily show a close correlation with as concentrations in groundwater table 2 groundwater tables tend to fluctuate during the year due to the large differences between rainfall and extensive withdrawal as a result oxygen reacts with as bearing minerals i e pyrite fes2 and arsenopyrite feass to release as eqs 6 and 7 fakhreddine et al 2015 sun et al 2016 the reduction of feooh under reducing conditions also releases as iii into the groundwater eq 8 xie et al 2015 iron iii reducing microorganisms also enhance the reduction of feooh to release as iii therefore the combination of natural processes together with human involvement lead to the introduction of inorganic as species into rice cultivating areas through groundwater irrigation 6 2 f e s 2 s

groundwater is usually fed by channels into paddy fields kabir et al 2016 polizzotto et al 2013 when as contaminated groundwater is used for irrigation typically a gradient in total as concentration in paddy soil water is observed high concentrations found near the channel inlet tapering down to relatively low levels at significant distances dittmar et al 2007 panaullah et al 2009 however a number of studies have demonstrated that flow velocity has a close relationship with as concentrations in the irrigation water along the irrigation channel at a slower flow velocity aggregation and subsequent settling of as bearing colloids occur due to the long residence time therefore slower flow velocity leads to a gradual decrease in total as concentrations observed along the irrigation channel fig 2 dittmar et al 2007 roberts et al 2007 in contrast a faster flow velocity has a short residence time which restricts the aggregation and subsequent settling down of as bearing colloids along the irrigation channels in this regard total as concentrations in irrigation water along the irrigation channel remains relatively unchanged at higher operating flow velocities dittmar et al 2007 roberts et al 2007 the type of irrigation channel i e man made concrete channel or soil clay ditch channel also change the total as concentration found in irrigation water along the channel length to a greater extent neumann et al 2014 chemical changes can also lead to decreased total as concentrations observed along irrigation channels most studies have focused on the total as concentration rather than as speciation as iii and as v in irrigation water however limited studies revealed that as iii which represents the majority of total as in groundwater gradually decreases as it travels along irrigation channels the rationale for this is that diffusion of atmospheric o2 into the irrigation water may oxidize as iii into as v reactive intermediates i e fe iv species formed during fe ii oxidation by o2 may also partly oxidize as iii into as v roberts et al 2004 as the irrigation water flows through the irrigation channel dissolved fe ii and mn ii are oxidized by diffused atmospheric o2 and consequently precipitated as fe oh 3 and mno2 dittmar et al 2007 the complexation and co precipitation of as v with metal hydro oxides i e fe and mn further reduce the total as concentrations found along irrigation channels fig 2 total as concentration further decreases once the irrigation water enters the paddy field for a range of different reasons it is obvious that once irrigation water comes into the paddy field that water flow rate across the paddy field will significantly decrease as a result colloid settling and as adsorption onto mineral particles takes place polizzotto et al 2013 demonstrated that total as concentration dropped by almost 50 of initial well water concentrations once irrigation water first entered the fields located only 40 m from the irrigation well when paddy fields were in static or standing conditions after being completely filled with irrigation water dissolved total as concentrations declined across the fields exhibiting little lateral variation within 4 h after irrigation polizzotto et al 2013 moreover as input with irrigation water mainly accumulates on top soil i e the root zone of the rice plants table 1 possibly due mainly to the oxidation adsorption and co precipitation of as species the paddy soil is submerged flooded for a long period of time out of the growing cycle and consequently undergoes a number of physico chemical reactions the water replaces the gaseous phase in the soil pores resulting in a decrease of eh for a flooded environment a number of redox reactions from high eh 700 mv to low eh 300 mv aerobic respiration nitrification denitrification mn iv reduction fe iii reduction so4 2 reduction and methanogenesis mainly governed by microorganisms occurs either sequentially or simultaneously during this period sahrawat 2015 if the paddy soil is initially acidic the ph of the soil tends to increase during the flooded conditions as reduction processes consume protons the reverse is true for alkaline paddy soils since co2 induces mineralization triggers of acidification sahrawat 2015 arsenic speciation and distribution in flooded and non flooded conditions during rice growth is a completely different process soil pore water contains higher concentrations of total as fe and mn than the irrigation water under flooded conditions in addition as iii as v ratios in the soil solution and submerged soil increase over time during the flooded period takahashi et al 2004 as stated above the development of a lower eh value in submerged paddy soils is the main reason for such results garnier et al 2010 assessed the changes in eh in paddy soil profile 0 20 cm during the rice growth cycle over 3 months from paddy soil preparation through to rice harvesting they found that the eh value had decreased along the soil profile with only slight variations except for a depth of 7 cm where less reduced conditions were observed possibly due to micro aeration by rice plant roots formation of root plaques greatly influence as mobility and bioavailability in paddy soil water systems with fe and mn co existing in rice root plaques liu et al 2005b however fe is the main element followed by mn in the plaques since feooh precipitates at lower eh levels than mn oxides therefore most of the previous studies have mainly focused on as species sequestration onto fe plaques in rice roots iron plaque mainly consists of ferrihydrite goethite and lepidocrocite violante et al 2003 radial oxygen loss rol which is the phenomenon releasing o2 into the rhizosphere through the root aerenchyma promotes fe plaque formation even though flooded conditions exist eq 9 colmer 2002 9 4 f e a q 2 3 o 2 g 6 h 2 o l 4 f e o h 3 s since rol depends on plant anatomy i e root porosity and root density and growth stage the amount of fe plaque on rice roots varies among rice genotypes liu et al 2004 mei et al 2009 violante et al 2003 indigenous fe levels in paddy soil systems also plays a key role in determining the amount of root plaque to be formed therefore a rice genotype grown in paddy soils with high fe concentration could have higher amounts of fe plaque than the same rice genotype grown in paddy soils with low fe concentrations iron plaque has high affinity with both as v and as iii hence fe plaque directly reduces the total as concentration in the paddy soil water systems and subsequently in rice plants external supplementation of fooh to paddy soils has been found to have positive effects on fe plaque formation suda et al 2016 yun et al 2016b one of the main drawbacks related to fe plaque is that the high density of fe plaque on rice roots may restrict the diffusion of o2 into the rhizosphere for this reason rhizospheric microorganisms associated with rice plant growth and health promotion may be adversely affected fe precipitation could also further hinder the nutrient uptake by rice roots ultra et al 2009 therefore a detailed investigation is required to further assess the role of fe plaque on the immobilization of as species in the rice plant growth cycle another important concern regarding the total as accumulation in paddy soils is interpretation of the total as content extent with respect to irrigation water i e mass balance calculations different studies have revealed that usage of as contaminated irrigation water in the concentration range of 100 400 μg l 1 leads to accumulation of total as in top paddy soil at a rate of 1 0 1 6 mg kg 1 y 1 dittmar et al 2007 martin et al 2007 meharg and rahman 2003 therefore long term studies are required to assess how loosely bound as fractions behave over time in addition as accumulation predictions can vary for many different reasons arsenic in paddy soil can also be removed through various different processes as mentioned earlier paddy fields which are subjected to seasonal flooding due to high rainfall remove a large amount of as roberts et al 2010 estimated that seasonal flooding removes 13 62 of as added to the paddy soils through irrigation each year in addition rapid as transfer below the plow pan i e a depth of approximately 20 25 cm may enhance preferential flow paths e g soil cracks formed under dry condition and mouse burrows dittmar et al 2007 evapotranspiration might also concentrate as in the soil solution on a short term basis but the link between evapotranspiration and as concentrations in paddy soil water system has not been comprehensively evaluated 3 3 effect of mining activities paddy soils can be contaminated by as if mining activities are active in close proximity to paddy fields table 1 so far a limited number of studies has reported the effects of mining on as contamination in paddy soils and there is no reporting thus far on as speciation dynamics in mining impacted paddy soils throughout the growth stage of rice plants mining of as bearing minerals i e arsenopyrite pyrite realgar ass and orpiment as2s3 and accompanied secondary as minerals are responsible for as contamination in paddy soils tailings and waste rocks acid mine drainage and wet and dry deposition of dust due to high rainfall and strong winds are responsible for as accumulation in rice fields in the vicinity of mining areas kwon et al 2017 yun et al 2016a china is the world s largest rice producer and is the best example for mining related as in paddy fields for instance long term mining activities in hunan province one of the largest rice producing regions in china led to high total as concentrations in adjacent paddy soils table 1 the pattern of the total as distribution in rice soils through mining operations varies due to different parent materials patel et al 2005 total as concentrations in paddy soils in hainan island china ranged between 0 1 and 45 9 mg kg 1 depending on the different rock types metamorphic rocks 18 9 45 9 mg kg 1 acid igneous rocks and basalt 0 1 5 9 and 0 2 4 2 mg kg 1 clastic sediments 0 4 10 9 mg kg 1 fu et al 2011 however total as concentrations in mining impacted paddy soils cannot provide sufficient information regarding the mobility and bioavailability of as therefore the associated environmental risks are to be required to be accessed focusing on speciation levels chemical fractionation through sequential extraction methods provides detailed information on as in paddy soils farooq et al 2010 fu et al 2011 hsu et al 2012 norra et al 2005 paddy soils affected by mining activities can have a higher percentage of residual phase as than the easily mobile phase and redox sensitive phases of as fig 3 arsenic binding to residual phases can only be released by strong environmental changes i e strong acids therefore the residual bound fraction is more stable than those loosely bound phases and redox sensitive phases however paddy soils contaminated with as contaminated irrigation water have a different story on chemical fractionation those soils have a higher concentration of as retained in loosely bound phases and redox sensitive phases whereas only the lowest concentration of as is associated with residual phases fig 3 accumulation of as in paddy soils due to as rich groundwater is primarily due to its co precipitation with or sorption onto poorly crystalline metal hydro oxides or other components such as crystalline metal hydro oxides clay minerals and organic matter of the soil matrix in contrast paddy soils contaminated with mining operations mainly contain residual bound as which limits both the mobility and bioavailability of as 4 role of microorganisms on as dynamics in paddy soil water systems aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms are in paddy soils involved in the as speciation through different processes zhang et al 2015b fig 4 illustrates the variety of direct as transformation pathways governed by microorganisms in paddy soil water systems 4 1 arsenic oxidation and reduction microorganisms inhabiting in the rhizosphere and bulk paddy soil are responsible for both as oxidation and reduction a range of genes present in microorganisms are encoded for as transformation enzymes and transporters zecchin et al 2017b microbial oxidation of as iii to as v which is less toxic and less mobile than as iii is considered as a detoxification mechanism of microorganisms coded for by the aioa gene zhang et al 2015b microbial oxidation of as iii takes place in both flooded and non flooded conditions in paddy soils paracoccus species can oxidize as iii under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions in paddy soil by using o2 and no3 as the respective electron acceptor zhang et al 2015a in addition as iii acts as an electron donor during the bacterial metabolism zheng et al 2013 once abiotic oxidation of as iii ceases due to passivation of reactive sites on the mineral surfaces microbiologically mediated as iii oxidation becomes prevalent in non flooded paddy soil even though the rate of conversion of as iii to as v is a slow process around 2 5 2 8 per day dong et al 2014 as iii oxidizing bacteria enhance plant growth promoting pgp substances for example a gram positive bacterium bacillus flexus aso 6 isolated from the rhizosphere of rice paddy plants showed elevated rates of as iii oxidation vmax 1 34 μm min 1 10 7 cell and had secreted plant growth promoting substances such as siderophores indole 3 acetic acid iaa and 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylate acc deaminase das et al 2016b therefore inoculation of as iii oxidizing bacteria is beneficial to not only minimize the as burden but also to promote growth in rice plants microorganisms are able to reduce as v to as iii in paddy soils mainly under flooded conditions two different pathways namely as detoxification and the respiratory pathway coded for by the arsc and arra genes respectively are involved in as v reduction malasarn et al 2004 villegas torres et al 2011 phylogenetically diverse bacteria can reduce as v to as iii even under non flooded conditions bachate et al 2009 microbial reduction of as v to more mobile as iii under both flooded and non flooded conditions may also enhance the as mobility and bioavailability in the paddy environment apart from direct as transformations microorganisms could indirectly govern the as speciation in paddy soil water systems for instance fe iii reducing and fe ii oxidizing bacteria play an important role in as transformation zecchin et al 2017b the relative abundance of fe iii reducing bacteria is high in continuous ﬂooded conditions therefore the reduction of fe iii minerals and consequent release of as iii is expected to be high under flooded conditions ohtsuka et al 2013 the application of soil amendments such as biochar may influence as v reduction wang et al 2017 the biochar can stimulate the growth and abundance of fe iii reducing bacterial growth i e clostridium bacillus and caloramator to facilitate as v reduction wang et al 2017 unfavorable low concentrations of fe ii and high levels of fe iii may also decrease the activity and abundance of fe iii reducing bacteria in paddy soils however little is known about the microbial community responsible for fe ii oxidation nitrate dependent fe ii oxidizing bacteria in flooded paddy soils can oxidize fe ii to fe iii arsenic species may precipitate or adsorb onto fe iii minerals in root plaque and bulk soils under such conditions dong et al 2016 as already stated in section 2 4 3 so4 2 reducing and so4 2 oxidizing bacteria could also influence as speciation in paddy soil water systems overall water management practices i e flooded and non flooded conditions together with physico chemical and environmental factors greatly determine the abundance and diversity of microorganisms in paddy soil systems zecchin et al 2017a 2017b for example the relative abundance of as fe and s reducing bacteria is increased under flooded conditions and the reverse is true under non flooded conditions das et al 2016a zecchin et al 2017a however there is no detailed report on microbial mediated as oxidation reduction kinetics and related rate limiting factors which may also slow down the reactions 4 2 arsenic methylation and volatilization microorganisms including bacteria fungi eukaryotic algae and archaea are mainly responsible for the conversion of inorganic as iii into methylated as species the microbial gene for as iii methylation arsm that encodes for as processing leads to the formation of mono di tri and tetra methyl as species wang et al 2014 zhao et al 2013 several factors contribute to the as methylation process under flooded conditions first increased diversity and activities of anaerobic microorganisms second extended flooded conditions for as iii transformation and increased substrate availability for as methylation third the reductive dissolution of metal hydro oxides desorb already sorbed methylated as species i e mma v and dma v into the soil solution rice plants are unable to methylate inorganic as in vivo therefore methylated as species present in rice may come through microbial mediated methylation in the rhizosphere lomax et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 arsenic volatilization from paddy environments accounted for 0 9 2 6 of global as emissions into the atmosphere mestrot et al 2011a it has been estimated that paddy soils contribute 419 1252 t of as emissions annually which is about 15 45 and 3 10 fold greater than the as emissions from sea spray and forest fires respectively mestrot et al 2011b zheng et al 2013 microorganisms are capable of volatilizing inorganic as to arsines fig 4 primarily as trimethylarsines tmas ch3 3as with low quantities of arsine ash3 monomethylarsine meash2 ch3 ash2 dimethylarsine me2ash ch3 2ash jia et al 2012 mestrot et al 2011a after volatilization tmas is rapidly oxidized by atmospheric o2 into trimethylarsine oxide tmas v o bhattacharya et al 2007 since as volatilization is strictly governed by microbial activities the rate and efficiency of as volatilization can be induced through the biostimulation promoting microbial activities and bioaugmentation inoculation of microbes processes chen et al 2017 total as concentration in soil pore water showed a positive correlation with total released arsines jia et al 2012 mestrot et al 2011a initial conversion of as iii to mma v determines the rate of arsines volatilization from paddy soils in this respect mma v and dma v application into paddy soil have shown an increase in yearly arsines volatilization rate of 3 5 mestrot et al 2011a 5 conclusions the distribution of as species in paddy soil water is obviously heterogeneous in space both laterally and vertically and varies over time it is clear that total as concentration in paddy soil water does not reflect the measurement from a single point and therefore an accurate understanding of spatial and temporal distribution of as species is essential the key knowledge gaps have been identified and are required to be addressed in future studies more importantly the consequence of natural geogenic sources i e weathering of as bearing minerals and alluvial deposits with respect to paddy soil as loadings needs more consideration a detailed investigation of soil mineralogy in areas under rice cultivation is essential the following aspects are also important 1 assessing the rate limiting factors i e physico chemical parameters on as speciation mobility and bioavailability 2 investigation of element levels for fe mn and s which are direct influences on as speciation and mobility at paddy soil profile levels 3 study the levels of ions and compounds po4 3 and si oh 4 that compete with inorganic as species for adsorption sites and influenced as species uptake by rice roots 4 identify key microorganisms and their mechanisms with regards to as speciation in paddy soil water 5 determination of how as biotransformation kinetics are regulated by different microorganisms 6 investigation of rice genotype variations in root plaque formation and as speciation in the rhizosphere moreover perturbed environmental conditions such as more frequent flooding acid rain and global warming may change the as dynamics in the paddy environment therefore impacts of extreme environmental conditions on as speciation and the mobility of rice ecosystems should be further explored scientific based knowledge on as dynamics in paddy ecosystems is important to design management practices to decrease as uptake into rice grain since water management practices mainly change the biogeochemical processes in paddy soil water systems aerobic and intermittent irrigation water management practices rather than the conventional irrigation management long period of flooded condition and short period of non flooded condition may decrease as levels in paddy soil pore water external supplementation of fe mn and s into the as contaminated paddy environments could immobilize inorganic as species through promotion of root plaque formation complexation and precipitation similarly incorporation of po4 3 and si oh 4 into the as contaminated rice fields may reduce as species uptake by rice roots however secondary contamination could be a major drawback related to the above amendments biostimulation by providing nutrients required for microbial growth may decrease as toxicity in paddy environments due to the enhancement of microbial mediated processes including as oxidation methylation and volatilization breeding and introduction of rice cultivars that decrease grain as accumulation would be another option and this area of research may prove fruitful 
19522,organic waste residues can be hydrothermally treated to produce organic acid rich liquors these hydrothermal liquors are a potential feedstock for polyhydroxyalkanoate pha production we investigated the effect of dissolved oxygen concentration and substrate feeding regimes on pha accumulation and yield using two hydrothermal liquors derived from a mixture of primary and secondary municipal wastewater treatment sludge and food waste the enriched culture accumulated a maximum of 41 pha of cell dry weight within 7 h which is among the highest reported for n and p rich hydrothermal liquors recovered pha was 77 polyhydroxybutyrate and 23 polyhydroxyvalerate by mass the families rhodocyclaceae 84 and saprospiraceae 20 5 were the dominant proteobacteria 73 in the enriched culture the third most abundant bacterial genus bdellovibrio includes species of known predators of pha producers which may lead to suboptimal pha accumulation the pha yield was directly proportional to do concentration for ammonia stripped liquor asl and inversely proportional to do concentration for low strength liquor lsl the highest yield of 0 50 cmol pha cmol substrate was obtained for asl at 25 do saturation a progressively increasing substrate feeding regime resulted in increased pha yields these findings demonstrate that substrate feeding regime and oxygen concentration can be used to control the pha yield and accumulation rate thereby enhancing pha production viability from nutrient rich biomass streams graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved oxygen feeding regime hydrothermal liquor nutrients polyhydroxyalkanoate pha accumulation 1 introduction polyhydroxyalkanoates pha are biopolymers of hydroxyl fatty acids that act as storage compounds during unbalanced microbial growth some bacterial species induce pha production as an intracellular carbon and energy reserve strategy under feast and famine conditions or limited nutrient conditions albuquerque et al 2010 venkateswar reddy and venkata mohan 2012 these pha polymers are fully biodegradable and possess thermoplastic properties similar to petrochemically derived polypropylene and polyethylene morgan sagastume et al 2010 bioplastics are increasingly recognised as able to offset growing concerns around the deleterious effects from petrochemically derived plastics such as environmental impact of non degradable plastics and green house gas emissions bugnicourt et al 2014 venkateswar reddy and venkata mohan 2012 the phas are the only class of polymers fully anabolised and catabolised by living cells where as other bioplastics such as polylactic acids are renewable resource based but chemically synthesized khanna and srivastava 2005 the high cost of bacterial fermentations remains a major hurdle to commercial production and application even though phas are an attractive substitute for petroleum derived polymers stringent requirements for pha production using pure cultures result in a process operation costs 5 10 times more expensive than conventional petroleum derived polymers serafim et al 2008 venkata mohan and venkateswar reddy 2013 mixed culture operations could substantially reduce costs related to pha production albuquerque et al 2011 carvalho et al 2014 dai et al 2015 morgan sagastume et al 2010 pittmann and steinmetz 2014 however mixed culture systems are constrained by low yields and poor volumetric productivities serafim et al 2008 low volumetric productivities are due to reduced 1 5 g l bacterial cell concentrations in mixed culture systems compared to pure culture systems 80 g l nevertheless some studies have reported pha accumulations 75 89 pha per biomass as total suspended solids tss on a mass basis comparable to those reported in pure cultures albuquerque et al 2010 jiang et al 2012 johnson et al 2009 these findings hold promise for commercial scale pha production from mixed bacterial cultures with waste derived feedstocks since external costs associated with sterilisation reactor construction materials and use of pure carbon substrates are minimised during mixed culture operation agro industry wastes have been previously investigated as low cost substrates for pha production albuquerque et al 2007 2011 bengtsson et al 2008 dionisi et al 2005 organic waste residues can be anaerobically fermented and or hydrothermally treated to produce organic acid rich liquors these volatile fatty acid vfa rich liquors are an ideal feedstock for pha production wastewater treatment plant sludges and food waste are two organic carbon rich solid waste streams that can be pre processed to produce vfa rich liquors previous work by morgan sagastume et al 2010 however reported pha accumulation of only 25 of dry cell weight using substrates derived from high pressure thermal hydrolyzed waste activated sludge followed by fermentation the elevated concentration of nutrients 3 5 g n l and 0 5 g p l in these liquors was reported to be a challenge to increasing pha yields morgan sagastume et al 2010 and an impediment to commercialization of pha production from high nutrient biomass sub critical wet oxidation involves processing at temperatures up to the critical point of water 374 c an oxidative environment is maintained usually through the addition of oxygen mishra et al 1995 van amstel and rietema 1973 yousefifar et al 2017 free radical reactions drive the conversion of organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water oxidation is generally incomplete and soluble organics are formed with acetic acid being the major identified product baroutian et al 2016 jin et al 2005 wet oxidation liquor thus has strong appeal as a candidate feedstock for mixed culture pha production apart from a conceptual description morgan sagastume et al 2014 we cannot find any literature that provides a technical description of pha production from wet oxidation liquors to the best of our knowledge oxidative hydrothermal liquors from wet oxidation of organic residues have not been investigated for pha production wet oxidation is highly effective in destructing vss eliminating pathogens from biological sludge and converting organic material to vfa particularly acetic acid hii et al 2014 therefore pha production from such liquors would enable minimizing sludge disposal from biological wastewater treatment plants and recovering part of the carbon in wastewaters mixed cultures may exhibit preference to substrate type concentration and nutrient forms that affect pha production and composition albuquerque et al 2010 cui et al 2016 morgan sagastume et al 2014 the effect of process parameters such as aeration feeding regime carbon loading and ph maintenance on pha production have been reported previously albuquerque et al 2011 liu et al 2011 venkateswar reddy and venkata mohan 2012 however significant knowledge gaps remain with respect to the conditions under which pha yields and production rates can be improved for example the influence of dissolved oxygen do content on the production of pha using complex organic substrates remains unresolved oxygen limitation during pha accumulation using glycerol as a substrate has been described previously to show little to no effect on pha accumulation moralejo gárate et al 2013 other studies however have reported that a greater fraction of substrate is accumulated as pha under microaerophilic conditions pratt et al 2012 satoh et al 1998 this work explores the pha production potential of substrates generated through sub critical wet oxidation wo of organic biomass in particular we have tested two aspects of mixed culture pha fermentation i the impact of a feed characterized by low carbon nitrogen ratio this being a natural characteristic of wet oxidized biomass conversion ii the influence of dissolved oxygen limitation as an alternative substrate limitation to enhance metabolism of carbon into pha storage in this study we report the production of high pha content and yield using nutrient rich hydrothermal liquor substrates in response to do concentration and substrate feeding regimes 2 methodology 2 1

feeding regime with diluted hydrothermal liquor hsl table 1 subsequently one of the sbrs was switched to lsl hydrothermal liquor table 1 to obtain a pha producing enriched culture acclimatised to lsl the lsl was characterized by a lower nutrient and vfa concentration and was used at 50 dilution 1 part liquor with 1 part local tap water by volume to give an organic loading rate of 38 g c m3 h and

either progressively increasing progressively decreasing or continuous addition during 9 h accumulation experiments equal volumes of liquor were added under each feeding regime and thus organic loading over the experimental period was identical progressive feeding regimes were operated according to the following discreet hourly volumes beginning with a feed volume of 40 ml liquor volumes were progressively increased by 10 ml every hour for 9 h progressively increasing progressively decreasing regimes operated in the reverse order beginning with 120 ml of liquor and reducing volumes by

edgar 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 culture enrichment enriching bacterial cultures for pha production require successive periods of feast famine a typical reaction phase of sbr cycle for reactors r1 and r2 for this enrichment is shown in fig 1 a samples taken at the end of feeding cycle t 0 contained 32 cmmol l 380 mg l of doc out of which 9 cmmol l 270 mg l was acetic acid both reactors exhibited nearly identical performance and demonstrated efficient consumption of hsl organic carbon the predominant vfa was acetic acid that constituted 28 of the initial doc and was exhausted below detectable limits within 75 min within the same period 89 of the degradable doc was also oxidized of which 45 was carbon from acetic acid accumulation of pha ceased within 120 min accounting for a feast famine ratio of 0 17 this feast famine proportionality is a critical parameter influencing the enrichment of pha producing bacterial cultures albuquerque et al 2010 dionisi et al 2006 2007 jiang et al 2011 feast famine ratios greater than 0 25 are reportedly detrimental to the enrichment of pha producing species with ratios of 0 13 0 20 cited as optimal when using synthetic substrates dionisi et al 2006 2007 jiang et al 2011 johnson et al 2009 organic waste derived liquors such as the ones used in this study contain a range of unidentified carbon containing compounds in addition to those vfas preferred for pha production by providing an extended feast period it is speculated that these alternative sources of carbon may affect the enrichment of pha producing bacterial species baseline pha production in acclimatised enriched cultures was established during the reaction phase of an sbr cycle we observed a maximum pha content of 12 8 w w r2 following 75 min of reaction fig 1b this result is consistent with the observation of acetic acid depletion and suggests this vfa serves as the preferred substrate for pha production following exhaustion of acetic acid t 75 min pha content within r1 biomass continued to increase for an additional 45 min t 120 min suggesting the presence of additional unidentified organic compounds were capable of supporting pha production the remaining degradable organic compounds t 120 min were inadequate or unable to support pha production as the levels of pha steadily declined in both reactors the observed accumulation and consumption of pha correlating with exhaustion of external organic substrates is demonstrative of an effective feed famine enrichment regime all measured vfas were degraded concurrently with acetic acid the only vfa detectable following 25 min incubation propionic acid the second most abundant vfa in hsl and implicated in production of hv monomers serafim et al 2008 was exhausted within 25 min of incubation the production of polyhydroxyvalerate phv occurred as propionic acid was consumed confirming that hsl liquor is capable of supporting phv production when present hv and its co polymers confers beneficial properties to pha biopolymers such as lower glass transition and melting temperatures reduction in the degree of crystallinity improved mechanical properties such as decreased stiffness brittleness and increased flexibility tensile strength and toughness albuquerque et al 2011 a polyhydroxybutyrate phb and phv containing co polymer phbv is a better amorphous product than the acetate or sugar substrate derived brittle pure phb albuquerque et al 2011 it is generally accepted that limiting one or more essential nutrients will induce pha accumulation in microorganisms basak et al 2011 salehizadeh and van loosdrecht 2004 serafim et al 2008 this triggering mechanism can also be induced by using alternating feast famine feeding regimes where carbon is depleted towards the end of each cycle analysis of hsl nutrients confirmed biologically available n and p were present at sufficient concentrations to support growth throughout feast famine feeding regimes in both sbr reactors reactor decants possessed 450 550 mg l of dissolved kjeldhal nitrogen dkn 330 400 mg l nitrogen as ammonium nh4 n and 15 40 mg l dissolved reactive phosphorus drp nitrate concentrations were below 1 mg l and therefore it was concluded that the enriched cultures did not possess nitrification capability it has been previously reported that the presence of ammonia throughout feast famine feeding regimes does not inhibit enrichment for pha storing organisms albuquerque et al 2007 likewise pha accumulation in nutrient rich substrates has been linked to carbon limitation morgan sagastume et al 2010 our findings support a carbon limiting mechanism during feast famine feeding of nutrient rich substrates resulting in mixed bacterial cultures enriched for pha accumulating microorganisms 3 2 microbial community composition microbial analysis of sbr reactor r1 was consistent with a stable enriched microbial community dominated by pha producing bacteria phylum level distributions of bacterial populations within enrichment reactor r1 were primarily divided among the proteobacteria 73 0 and bacteroidetes 25 2 the verrucomicrobia 0 6 actinobacteria 0 2 gemmatimonadetes 0 1 and firmicutes 0 1 accounted for less than 1 of identified operational taxonomic units otus of the proteobacteria 84 were classified to the family rhodocyclaceae beta sub group gram negative genus thauera fig 2 thauera are known to produce pha within both feast famine enrichments fed with acetate propionate and lactate lemos et al 2008 and fermented molasses fed sbrs albuquerque et al 2013 in contrast the paracoccus and azoarcus genera other proteobacteria commonly associated with pha production accounted for less than 0 03 of total otus the family saprospiraceae was the second most abundant 20 5 otu identified these bacteroidetes are abundant in wastewater treatment plants and associated with biological phosphorous removal kong et al 2007 and protein hydrolysis xia et al 2008 however they are not known to produce pha xia et al 2008 it seems likely the n and p content of hsl was sufficient to support their growth and enrichment throughout successive feast famine cycles the genus bdellovibrio was identified as the third most abundant 3 5 otu members of this genus are known to parasitize other gram negative species by entering into their periplasmic space where they feed on various complex biopolymers rendulic et al 2004 during predation bdellovibrio bacteriovorus hd100 efficiently hydrolyses and consumes the medium chain length phas produced by pseudomonas putida martinez et al 2013 but is inactive towards short chain length phas such as phb martínez et al 2012 studies investigating the population dynamics of bdellovibrio in pha accumulating mixed culture systems are lacking however kandel et al 2014 have reported the abundance of these obligate parasites to be 0 13 1 4 in aquaculture zero discharge systems over a seven month period a complete loss of pha accumulation potential was not encountered during the study period suggesting that bdellovibrio was never the dominant organism in our mixed culture abundance of bdellovibrio in r1 therefore suggests sub optimal pha production may in part be a consequence of a basal level of predation on pha producers by these species while it is possible dramatic drops in pha accumulation levels fig 1 may also be attributed to such predation events this eventuality seems likely and would require experimental verification even at low levels however predation by these bacteria is likely to have significant impact on pha productivity and future efforts to improve reactor productivity should seek to quantify and minimise pha predation by these species 3 3 batch pha accumulation 3 3 1 substrate composition rates of pha production when using hsl and asl liquors as feeds in batch reactors were similar throughout the entire 700 min incubation fig 3 both liquors degraded at equivalent rates with similar residual carbon concentrations at 10 do saturation rates of doc consumption decreased following 75 min incubation from above 70 cmmol hr to below 40 cmmol hr in both hsl and asl fed reactors cumulative specific carbon consumption steadily increased throughout incubation with no significant differences between liquors thus there was no advantage of ammonia stripping from liquors in terms of pha production there was steady accumulation of pha in both reactors for the first 250 min with only 10 w w additional pha accumulating in the following 250 min although 12 40 cmmol h 1 was consumed in the final 250 min incubation period pha accumulation was minimal the value gained from carbon consumption during this period was thus being diverted towards energy maintenance and cell growth rather than pha production total pha accumulation in both reactors reached 40 1 w w of tss at the end of the 700 min accumulation period analyzed pha biopolymers were 30 8 w w phb and 9 3 w w phv the pha contents reported in this study are therefore among the highest reported using high nutrient liquors in a comparable study production of pha from fermented waste activated sludge pretreated by high pressure thermal hydrolysis and containing excess n and p achieved contents around 25 per unit dry biomass morgan sagastume et al 2010 important differences between the two studies are the sequence of fermentation and hydrothermal treatment used for production of substrate from sludge use of thermal hydrolysis as against wet oxidation and the different enrichment cycles and organic loading rates employed the longer feast famine ratio 0 26 0 37 applied by morgan sagastume et al 2010 would have led to suboptimal enrichment of the culture leading to lower pha accumulation levels jiang et al 2011 in another more recent study pha accumulation of 0 39 g pha g vss was reported using fermented sludge as a substrate morgan sagastume et al 2015 in that study too the nutrients in fermented sludge are cited as a challenge to pha accumulation with cell growth rather than an accumulation response resulting in lower pha yields the use of a non acclimatized substrate for pha accumulation possibly lead to suboptimal accumulation as acclimation of a microbial culture to substrate is reported to improve pha accumulation and productivity morgan sagastume et al 2017 in this study we report a pha yield of 0 55 cmol cmol for asl based on consumed doc which is within the range reported in literature albuquerque et al 2011 morgan sagastume et al 2010 we anticipate that greater yields could have been achieved if the accumulation period had been terminated after 300 min at which point pha had reached around 92 of its potential subsequent carbon utilization that is not associated with pha production had reduced the total yield 3 3 2 dissolved oxygen at low do concentrations reduced levels of adenosine triphosphate limit the anabolic activities required for bacterial growth and pha accumulation is induced salehizadeh and van loosdrecht 2004 under conditions of oxygen depleted redox stress high intracellular ratios of reduced to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh nad are observed phb synthesis allows for the oxidation of reduced electron carriers nadh and the continuation of metabolism the low do concentrations 10 saturation equating to 0 8 mg o2 l employed in the study described in section 3 3 1 therefore likely contributed to the high content of pha observed the do concentrations further investigated were 5 15 and 25 saturation 0 4 1 1 and 1 9 mg o2 l respectively the rate of pha accumulation and pha content in biomass incubated under the different do concentrations with asl and lsl substrates is shown in fig 4 a and b there were clear differences in pha accumulation rates among the range of do saturation levels in asl fed bioreactors fig 4a table 4 both the greatest rates of pha accumulation and highest pha content in biomass were observed at 25 do saturation level when 80 100 do saturation was applied the pha content in biomass 39 was comparable to that obtained under 25 do saturation supplementary data fig s1 as lower do saturations were applied 5 and 15 pha accumulation rates also decreased the rate of pha accumulation decreased with time in both liquor fed reactors likely as a consequence of pha accumulation approaching saturation and pha production kinetics exhibiting saturation kinetics however when the pha content approached maximum value fig 4b t 6 h the pha accumulation rates for 5 and 15 do cultures exceeded that of the 25 do culture after 5 h of accumulation the rates were below 2 pha hr even though some carbon consumption was apparent from the data supplementary data figs s4 and s5 for lsl the rate of pha accumulation among the three do conditions investigated was not significantly different table 4 the greatest accumulation rate and the highest pha content 26 6 w w was observed in 5 do saturation level experiments following 9 h incubation pha continued to accumulate with 5 do indicating further production potential the specific rate of pha increase for both 5 and 15 do were greater for lsl than for asl fig 4a this suggests that when carbon is limiting reduced do concentrations are favourable for pha accumulation conversely greater do saturation is appropriate when total doc is high these results suggest do control can influence the rate of pha accumulation but not necessarily the maximum potential our results demonstrate that regardless of do concentrations more than 85 of pha potential is accumulated within the first 5 h except for lsl at 5 do when only 72 of the potential was accumulated at higher do concentrations the rate of carbon uptake increased and maximum pha storage occurred earlier this observation is in agreement with the conclusions of moralejo gárate et al 2013 who used glycerol as a substrate carbon uptake and utilization for energy maintenance and cell growth during the pha accumulation phase will reduce the pha yield and constitute wastage of substrate unutilized residual carbon may inhibit microbial activity which results in substrate toxicity and complications in waste disposal substrate costs account for the largest economic component of operation within a pha production facility therefore efforts should seek to minimise residual doc following fermentations in this research there was no clear relationship between residual doc concentration and pha accumulation observed supplementary data figs s2 and s3 up to 40 pha content of the biomass was obtained when residual doc concentrations were above 1000 mg l there appears to be no benefit to adding excess carbon during the production of pha an optimised accumulation stage managing inputs in response to residual carbon in the system therefore could reduce the costs of pha production 3 3 3 feeding regime the accumulation of pha in biomass under the different feeding regimes for the asl liquor is shown in fig 5 a cultures continuously fed with asl resulted in the highest accumulation of pha 33 pha tss all feeding regimes exhibited a linear increase in pha content during the initial 3 h of incubation with higher initial rates of accumulation observed for continuous and progressively increasing regimes the accumulation profiles for continuous and progressively increasing feeding regimes show a plateau for the remaining 6 h period during which very little pha accumulation occurred fig 5a however higher initial rates of accumulation for both continuous and progressively increasing regimes are apparent being 3 6 fold greater than the hourly and decreasing regimes when initial liquor loading was low continuous and increasing feeding regimes an elevated rate of pha accumulation was observed an increase in pha accumulation from continuous feeding compared to pulse feeding was also reported in a recent study with low biomass loading rate of 3 5 5 5 cmol vfa cmol x d chen et al 2015 the authors of that study attribute the increase to self balanced ph state in the continuous feeding system however the impact on ph with feed addition was minimal in our study due to neutral ph of asl continuous feeding with asl led to a 7 4 increase in the hv content compared to the hourly feeding regime indicating that polymer composition may be manipulated via feeding strategy the progressively increasing and decreasing regimes also produced 5 3 and 4 0 greater hv content in pha compared to the hourly fed regime these increases are comparable with reports of 8 hv content increase when continuous feeding regimes were compared to pulse feeding of a mixed synthetic vfas substrate albuquerque et al 2011 although the pha synthesis is dependent on substrate uptake rates which are governed by the saturation kinetics as described by monod expression such an explicit relationship with substrate concentration was not observed in this study fig 5b maximum pha accumulation potential is biomass specific and depends on the culture enrichment efficacy however the do concentration and feeding regimen do influence the rate of pha accumulation as seen in fig 5b and c during the initial 3 h most of the carbon taken up is used for pha production subsequent carbon uptake is inefficient in terms of pha synthesis and directed towards cellular growth and maintenance requirements 3 4 pha yield on carbon yield provides the efficiency of conversion of a substrate to pha the pha yield rather than the maximum pha content in biomass is a critical parameter for assessing pha production most reported pha yields are based on vfa substrates with values of 0 77 0 80 cmol pha cmol vfa albuquerque et al 2011 0 4 cmol pha cmol vfa for a substrate derived by fermentation and pressurised thermal hydrolysis of waste activated sludge morgan sagastume et al 2010 0 48 0 68 cmol phb cmol acetate for synthetic substrate containing acetate as the sole carbon source third et al 2003 0 75 0 93 cmol phb cmol substrate containing butyrate marang et al 2013 and 0 25 0 44 cmol phv cmol vfa for paper mill wastewater with nutrient excess and nutrient limited conditions bengtsson et al 2008 the pha yields calculated for asl and lsl under the different do concentrations and feeding regimes are given in table 4 the effect of sampling and feed addition was considered in the calculation the highest yield for lsl was obtained under the lowest do saturation employed and the yield decreased with increasing do saturation results show that at lower do concentrations a greater proportion of consumed carbon is converted into pha under carbon limitation this is consistent with previous reports on do supply rates in acetate fed third et al 2003 and glycerol fed moralejo gárate et al 2013 sbrs a similar result is reported by pratt et al 2012 for a vfa fed bacterial enrichment they also concluded that the microaerophilic conditions decrease the pha production rates which are in accordance with the observations of this study under increased do concentrations a greater proportion of carbon is taken up but this is used for respiration and growth table 4 however for asl the pha yields increased with increasing do saturation table 4 it seems to be less incentive energetically for microorganisms to store carbon as pha under low do saturation and in the presence of abundant carbon the limited carbon taken up at the rate of 0 13 cmol cmol x h is mostly used for respiration and cell maintenance table 4 in the presence of high do flux and ample carbon the carbon uptake rate is high at 0 8 cmol cmol x h and more carbon is stored as pha this hypothesis needs further scientific verification via the modelling of cellular energetics feeding regimes also influenced the pha yield and the carbon uptake rates the progressively increasing feeding of asl and lsl liquors resulted in the highest yield and continuous addition of the two liquors resulted in the lowest pha yields when ample carbon and nutrients are available the incentive for storage polymer production is reduced and carbon is used for growth and respiration under limiting conditions a greater proportion of carbon is converted into pha approaching pha accumulating capacity of biomass the higher loading of substrate helped preserve the accumulated pha as well as accumulation of further pha at a lower rate the highest average specific pha productivity was obtained for asl continuous feeding regime which is consistent with prior reports albuquerque et al 2011 even with asl as substrate there was sufficient n as organic n and p in liquor and residual nutrients in the seed culture that resulted in sufficient nutrients for microbial growth to occur in the accumulation phase thus growth was not controlled by nutrient limitation as in most other studies which reduce the pha yield consequently the maximum pha yield obtained in this study was 0 50 cmol pha cmol substrate consumed compared to yields of 0 75 0 93 cmol pha cmol vfa in some other studies albuquerque et al 2011 marang et al 2013 the reduced yield values obtained in this study could be due to the substrate type used poor culture enrichment predation of pha producers by species such as bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and excessive microbial growth during the accumulation stage however the yield for asl was significantly higher than for lsl which can be attributed to the lower concentration of vfa carbon 4 conclusions we investigated for the first time the production of pha from nutrient rich wet oxidation liquors organic waste derived hydrothermal liquors were found to be a good substrate for pha production the enriched culture accumulated a maximum of 41 pha of dry cell weight containing 77 phb and 23 phv this is among the highest reported pha accumulations for substrates containing n and p rich hydrothermal liquors the enriched mixed bacterial culture contained a rarely reported bdellovibrio bacteriovorus species accounting for 3 5 of the total otus a known predator of gram negative pha producers strategies to improve pha yield on substrate in the two stage pha production process were investigated with two hydrothermal liquors controlling do in the accumulation stage was effective at diverting more carbon into pha production for low carbon concentration liquor substrates equal doses of substrate fed hourly at 25 do saturation was found to be the best conditions based on pha yield on substrate feeding regimes also affected the rate of pha accumulation and composition this suggests novel opportunities for manipulating polymer composition it is recommended that a residual carbon based feeding strategy be further investigated to reduce substrate

19522,organic waste residues can be hydrothermally treated to produce organic acid rich liquors these hydrothermal liquors are a potential feedstock for polyhydroxyalkanoate pha production we investigated the effect of dissolved oxygen concentration and substrate feeding regimes on pha accumulation and yield using two hydrothermal liquors derived from a mixture of primary and secondary municipal wastewater treatment sludge and food waste the enriched culture accumulated a maximum of 41 pha of cell dry weight within 7 h which is among the highest reported for n and p rich hydrothermal liquors recovered pha was 77 polyhydroxybutyrate and 23 polyhydroxyvalerate by mass the families rhodocyclaceae 84 and saprospiraceae 20 5 were the dominant proteobacteria 73 in the enriched culture the third most abundant bacterial genus bdellovibrio includes species of known predators of pha producers which may lead to suboptimal pha accumulation the pha yield was directly proportional to do concentration for ammonia stripped liquor asl and inversely proportional to do concentration for low strength liquor lsl the highest yield of 0 50 cmol pha cmol substrate was obtained for asl at 25 do saturation a progressively increasing substrate feeding regime resulted in increased pha yields these findings demonstrate that substrate feeding regime and oxygen concentration can be used to control the pha yield and accumulation rate thereby enhancing pha production viability from nutrient rich biomass streams graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved oxygen feeding regime hydrothermal liquor nutrients polyhydroxyalkanoate pha accumulation 1 introduction polyhydroxyalkanoates pha are biopolymers of hydroxyl fatty acids that act as storage compounds during unbalanced microbial growth some bacterial species induce pha production as an intracellular carbon and energy reserve strategy under feast and famine conditions or limited nutrient conditions albuquerque et al 2010 venkateswar reddy and venkata mohan 2012 these pha polymers are fully biodegradable and possess thermoplastic properties similar to petrochemically derived polypropylene and polyethylene morgan sagastume et al 2010 bioplastics are increasingly recognised as able to offset growing concerns around the deleterious effects from petrochemically derived plastics such as environmental impact of non degradable plastics and green house gas emissions bugnicourt et al 2014 venkateswar reddy and venkata mohan 2012 the phas are the only class of polymers fully anabolised and catabolised by living cells where as other bioplastics such as polylactic acids are renewable resource based but chemically synthesized khanna and srivastava 2005 the high cost of bacterial fermentations remains a major hurdle to commercial production and application even though phas are an attractive substitute for petroleum derived polymers stringent requirements for pha production using pure cultures result in a process operation costs 5 10 times more expensive than conventional petroleum derived polymers serafim et al 2008 venkata mohan and venkateswar reddy 2013 mixed culture operations could substantially reduce costs related to pha production albuquerque et al 2011 carvalho et al 2014 dai et al 2015 morgan sagastume et al 2010 pittmann and steinmetz 2014 however mixed culture systems are constrained by low yields and poor volumetric productivities serafim et al 2008 low volumetric productivities are due to reduced 1 5 g l bacterial cell concentrations in mixed culture systems compared to pure culture systems 80 g l nevertheless some studies have reported pha accumulations 75 89 pha per biomass as total suspended solids tss on a mass basis comparable to those reported in pure cultures albuquerque et al 2010 jiang et al 2012 johnson et al 2009 these findings hold promise for commercial scale pha production from mixed bacterial cultures with waste derived feedstocks since external costs associated with sterilisation reactor construction materials and use of pure carbon substrates are minimised during mixed culture operation agro industry wastes have been previously investigated as low cost substrates for pha production albuquerque et al 2007 2011 bengtsson et al 2008 dionisi et al 2005 organic waste residues can be anaerobically fermented and or hydrothermally treated to produce organic acid rich liquors these volatile fatty acid vfa rich liquors are an ideal feedstock for pha production wastewater treatment plant sludges and food waste are two organic carbon rich solid waste streams that can be pre processed to produce vfa rich liquors previous work by morgan sagastume et al 2010 however reported pha accumulation of only 25 of dry cell weight using substrates derived from high pressure thermal hydrolyzed waste activated sludge followed by fermentation the elevated concentration of nutrients 3 5 g n l and 0 5 g p l in these liquors was reported to be a challenge to increasing pha yields morgan sagastume et al 2010 and an impediment to commercialization of pha production from high nutrient biomass sub critical wet oxidation involves processing at temperatures up to the critical point of water 374 c an oxidative environment is maintained usually through the addition of oxygen mishra et al 1995 van amstel and rietema 1973 yousefifar et al 2017 free radical reactions drive the conversion of organic compounds to carbon dioxide and water oxidation is generally incomplete and soluble organics are formed with acetic acid being the major identified product baroutian et al 2016 jin et al 2005 wet oxidation liquor thus has strong appeal as a candidate feedstock for mixed culture pha production apart from a conceptual description morgan sagastume et al 2014 we cannot find any literature that provides a technical description of pha production from wet oxidation liquors to the best of our knowledge oxidative hydrothermal liquors from wet oxidation of organic residues have not been investigated for pha production wet oxidation is highly effective in destructing vss eliminating pathogens from biological sludge and converting organic material to vfa particularly acetic acid hii et al 2014 therefore pha production from such liquors would enable minimizing sludge disposal from biological wastewater treatment plants and recovering part of the carbon in wastewaters mixed cultures may exhibit preference to substrate type concentration and nutrient forms that affect pha production and composition albuquerque et al 2010 cui et al 2016 morgan sagastume et al 2014 the effect of process parameters such as aeration feeding regime carbon loading and ph maintenance on pha production have been reported previously albuquerque et al 2011 liu et al 2011 venkateswar reddy and venkata mohan 2012 however significant knowledge gaps remain with respect to the conditions under which pha yields and production rates can be improved for example the influence of dissolved oxygen do content on the production of pha using complex organic substrates remains unresolved oxygen limitation during pha accumulation using glycerol as a substrate has been described previously to show little to no effect on pha accumulation moralejo gárate et al 2013 other studies however have reported that a greater fraction of substrate is accumulated as pha under microaerophilic conditions pratt et al 2012 satoh et al 1998 this work explores the pha production potential of substrates generated through sub critical wet oxidation wo of organic biomass in particular we have tested two aspects of mixed culture pha fermentation i the impact of a feed characterized by low carbon nitrogen ratio this being a natural characteristic of wet oxidized biomass conversion ii the influence of dissolved oxygen limitation as an alternative substrate limitation to enhance metabolism of carbon into pha storage in this study we report the production of high pha content and yield using nutrient rich hydrothermal liquor substrates in response to do concentration and substrate feeding regimes 2 methodology 2 1

edgar 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 culture enrichment enriching bacterial cultures for pha production require successive periods of feast famine a typical reaction phase of sbr cycle for reactors r1 and r2 for this enrichment is shown in fig 1 a samples taken at the end of feeding cycle t 0 contained 32 cmmol l 380 mg l of doc out of which 9 cmmol l 270 mg l was acetic acid both reactors exhibited nearly identical performance and demonstrated efficient consumption of hsl organic carbon the predominant vfa was acetic acid that constituted 28 of the initial doc and was exhausted below detectable limits within 75 min within the same period 89 of the degradable doc was also oxidized of which 45 was carbon from acetic acid accumulation of pha ceased within 120 min accounting for a feast famine ratio of 0 17 this feast famine proportionality is a critical parameter influencing the enrichment of pha producing bacterial cultures albuquerque et al 2010 dionisi et al 2006 2007 jiang et al 2011 feast famine ratios greater than 0 25 are reportedly detrimental to the enrichment of pha producing species with ratios of 0 13 0 20 cited as optimal when using synthetic substrates dionisi et al 2006 2007 jiang et al 2011 johnson et al 2009 organic waste derived liquors such as the ones used in this study contain a range of unidentified carbon containing compounds in addition to those vfas preferred for pha production by providing an extended feast period it is speculated that these alternative sources of carbon may affect the enrichment of pha producing bacterial species baseline pha production in acclimatised enriched cultures was established during the reaction phase of an sbr cycle we observed a maximum pha content of 12 8 w w r2 following 75 min of reaction fig 1b this result is consistent with the observation of acetic acid depletion and suggests this vfa serves as the preferred substrate for pha production following exhaustion of acetic acid t 75 min pha content within r1 biomass continued to increase for an additional 45 min t 120 min suggesting the presence of additional unidentified organic compounds were capable of supporting pha production the remaining degradable organic compounds t 120 min were inadequate or unable to support pha production as the levels of pha steadily declined in both reactors the observed accumulation and consumption of pha correlating with exhaustion of external organic substrates is demonstrative of an effective feed famine enrichment regime all measured vfas were degraded concurrently with acetic acid the only vfa detectable following 25 min incubation propionic acid the second most abundant vfa in hsl and implicated in production of hv monomers serafim et al 2008 was exhausted within 25 min of incubation the production of polyhydroxyvalerate phv occurred as propionic acid was consumed confirming that hsl liquor is capable of supporting phv production when present hv and its co polymers confers beneficial properties to pha biopolymers such as lower glass transition and melting temperatures reduction in the degree of crystallinity improved mechanical properties such as decreased stiffness brittleness and increased flexibility tensile strength and toughness albuquerque et al 2011 a polyhydroxybutyrate phb and phv containing co polymer phbv is a better amorphous product than the acetate or sugar substrate derived brittle pure phb albuquerque et al 2011 it is generally accepted that limiting one or more essential nutrients will induce pha accumulation in microorganisms basak et al 2011 salehizadeh and van loosdrecht 2004 serafim et al 2008 this triggering mechanism can also be induced by using alternating feast famine feeding regimes where carbon is depleted towards the end of each cycle analysis of hsl nutrients confirmed biologically available n and p were present at sufficient concentrations to support growth throughout feast famine feeding regimes in both sbr reactors reactor decants possessed 450 550 mg l of dissolved kjeldhal nitrogen dkn 330 400 mg l nitrogen as ammonium nh4 n and 15 40 mg l dissolved reactive phosphorus drp nitrate concentrations were below 1 mg l and therefore it was concluded that the enriched cultures did not possess nitrification capability it has been previously reported that the presence of ammonia throughout feast famine feeding regimes does not inhibit enrichment for pha storing organisms albuquerque et al 2007 likewise pha accumulation in nutrient rich substrates has been linked to carbon limitation morgan sagastume et al 2010 our findings support a carbon limiting mechanism during feast famine feeding of nutrient rich substrates resulting in mixed bacterial cultures enriched for pha accumulating microorganisms 3 2 microbial community composition microbial analysis of sbr reactor r1 was consistent with a stable enriched microbial community dominated by pha producing bacteria phylum level distributions of bacterial populations within enrichment reactor r1 were primarily divided among the proteobacteria 73 0 and bacteroidetes 25 2 the verrucomicrobia 0 6 actinobacteria 0 2 gemmatimonadetes 0 1 and firmicutes 0 1 accounted for less than 1 of identified operational taxonomic units otus of the proteobacteria 84 were classified to the family rhodocyclaceae beta sub group gram negative genus thauera fig 2 thauera are known to produce pha within both feast famine enrichments fed with acetate propionate and lactate lemos et al 2008 and fermented molasses fed sbrs albuquerque et al 2013 in contrast the paracoccus and azoarcus genera other proteobacteria commonly associated with pha production accounted for less than 0 03 of total otus the family saprospiraceae was the second most abundant 20 5 otu identified these bacteroidetes are abundant in wastewater treatment plants and associated with biological phosphorous removal kong et al 2007 and protein hydrolysis xia et al 2008 however they are not known to produce pha xia et al 2008 it seems likely the n and p content of hsl was sufficient to support their growth and enrichment throughout successive feast famine cycles the genus bdellovibrio was identified as the third most abundant 3 5 otu members of this genus are known to parasitize other gram negative species by entering into their periplasmic space where they feed on various complex biopolymers rendulic et al 2004 during predation bdellovibrio bacteriovorus hd100 efficiently hydrolyses and consumes the medium chain length phas produced by pseudomonas putida martinez et al 2013 but is inactive towards short chain length phas such as phb martínez et al 2012 studies investigating the population dynamics of bdellovibrio in pha accumulating mixed culture systems are lacking however kandel et al 2014 have reported the abundance of these obligate parasites to be 0 13 1 4 in aquaculture zero discharge systems over a seven month period a complete loss of pha accumulation potential was not encountered during the study period suggesting that bdellovibrio was never the dominant organism in our mixed culture abundance of bdellovibrio in r1 therefore suggests sub optimal pha production may in part be a consequence of a basal level of predation on pha producers by these species while it is possible dramatic drops in pha accumulation levels fig 1 may also be attributed to such predation events this eventuality seems likely and would require experimental verification even at low levels however predation by these bacteria is likely to have significant impact on pha productivity and future efforts to improve reactor productivity should seek to quantify and minimise pha predation by these species 3 3 batch pha accumulation 3 3 1 substrate composition rates of pha production when using hsl and asl liquors as feeds in batch reactors were similar throughout the entire 700 min incubation fig 3 both liquors degraded at equivalent rates with similar residual carbon concentrations at 10 do saturation rates of doc consumption decreased following 75 min incubation from above 70 cmmol hr to below 40 cmmol hr in both hsl and asl fed reactors cumulative specific carbon consumption steadily increased throughout incubation with no significant differences between liquors thus there was no advantage of ammonia stripping from liquors in terms of pha production there was steady accumulation of pha in both reactors for the first 250 min with only 10 w w additional pha accumulating in the following 250 min although 12 40 cmmol h 1 was consumed in the final 250 min incubation period pha accumulation was minimal the value gained from carbon consumption during this period was thus being diverted towards energy maintenance and cell growth rather than pha production total pha accumulation in both reactors reached 40 1 w w of tss at the end of the 700 min accumulation period analyzed pha biopolymers were 30 8 w w phb and 9 3 w w phv the pha contents reported in this study are therefore among the highest reported using high nutrient liquors in a comparable study production of pha from fermented waste activated sludge pretreated by high pressure thermal hydrolysis and containing excess n and p achieved contents around 25 per unit dry biomass morgan sagastume et al 2010 important differences between the two studies are the sequence of fermentation and hydrothermal treatment used for production of substrate from sludge use of thermal hydrolysis as against wet oxidation and the different enrichment cycles and organic loading rates employed the longer feast famine ratio 0 26 0 37 applied by morgan sagastume et al 2010 would have led to suboptimal enrichment of the culture leading to lower pha accumulation levels jiang et al 2011 in another more recent study pha accumulation of 0 39 g pha g vss was reported using fermented sludge as a substrate morgan sagastume et al 2015 in that study too the nutrients in fermented sludge are cited as a challenge to pha accumulation with cell growth rather than an accumulation response resulting in lower pha yields the use of a non acclimatized substrate for pha accumulation possibly lead to suboptimal accumulation as acclimation of a microbial culture to substrate is reported to improve pha accumulation and productivity morgan sagastume et al 2017 in this study we report a pha yield of 0 55 cmol cmol for asl based on consumed doc which is within the range reported in literature albuquerque et al 2011 morgan sagastume et al 2010 we anticipate that greater yields could have been achieved if the accumulation period had been terminated after 300 min at which point pha had reached around 92 of its potential subsequent carbon utilization that is not associated with pha production had reduced the total yield 3 3 2 dissolved oxygen at low do concentrations reduced levels of adenosine triphosphate limit the anabolic activities required for bacterial growth and pha accumulation is induced salehizadeh and van loosdrecht 2004 under conditions of oxygen depleted redox stress high intracellular ratios of reduced to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh nad are observed phb synthesis allows for the oxidation of reduced electron carriers nadh and the continuation of metabolism the low do concentrations 10 saturation equating to 0 8 mg o2 l employed in the study described in section 3 3 1 therefore likely contributed to the high content of pha observed the do concentrations further investigated were 5 15 and 25 saturation 0 4 1 1 and 1 9 mg o2 l respectively the rate of pha accumulation and pha content in biomass incubated under the different do concentrations with asl and lsl substrates is shown in fig 4 a and b there were clear differences in pha accumulation rates among the range of do saturation levels in asl fed bioreactors fig 4a table 4 both the greatest rates of pha accumulation and highest pha content in biomass were observed at 25 do saturation level when 80 100 do saturation was applied the pha content in biomass 39 was comparable to that obtained under 25 do saturation supplementary data fig s1 as lower do saturations were applied 5 and 15 pha accumulation rates also decreased the rate of pha accumulation decreased with time in both liquor fed reactors likely as a consequence of pha accumulation approaching saturation and pha production kinetics exhibiting saturation kinetics however when the pha content approached maximum value fig 4b t 6 h the pha accumulation rates for 5 and 15 do cultures exceeded that of the 25 do culture after 5 h of accumulation the rates were below 2 pha hr even though some carbon consumption was apparent from the data supplementary data figs s4 and s5 for lsl the rate of pha accumulation among the three do conditions investigated was not significantly different table 4 the greatest accumulation rate and the highest pha content 26 6 w w was observed in 5 do saturation level experiments following 9 h incubation pha continued to accumulate with 5 do indicating further production potential the specific rate of pha increase for both 5 and 15 do were greater for lsl than for asl fig 4a this suggests that when carbon is limiting reduced do concentrations are favourable for pha accumulation conversely greater do saturation is appropriate when total doc is high these results suggest do control can influence the rate of pha accumulation but not necessarily the maximum potential our results demonstrate that regardless of do concentrations more than 85 of pha potential is accumulated within the first 5 h except for lsl at 5 do when only 72 of the potential was accumulated at higher do concentrations the rate of carbon uptake increased and maximum pha storage occurred earlier this observation is in agreement with the conclusions of moralejo gárate et al 2013 who used glycerol as a substrate carbon uptake and utilization for energy maintenance and cell growth during the pha accumulation phase will reduce the pha yield and constitute wastage of substrate unutilized residual carbon may inhibit microbial activity which results in substrate toxicity and complications in waste disposal substrate costs account for the largest economic component of operation within a pha production facility therefore efforts should seek to minimise residual doc following fermentations in this research there was no clear relationship between residual doc concentration and pha accumulation observed supplementary data figs s2 and s3 up to 40 pha content of the biomass was obtained when residual doc concentrations were above 1000 mg l there appears to be no benefit to adding excess carbon during the production of pha an optimised accumulation stage managing inputs in response to residual carbon in the system therefore could reduce the costs of pha production 3 3 3 feeding regime the accumulation of pha in biomass under the different feeding regimes for the asl liquor is shown in fig 5 a cultures continuously fed with asl resulted in the highest accumulation of pha 33 pha tss all feeding regimes exhibited a linear increase in pha content during the initial 3 h of incubation with higher initial rates of accumulation observed for continuous and progressively increasing regimes the accumulation profiles for continuous and progressively increasing feeding regimes show a plateau for the remaining 6 h period during which very little pha accumulation occurred fig 5a however higher initial rates of accumulation for both continuous and progressively increasing regimes are apparent being 3 6 fold greater than the hourly and decreasing regimes when initial liquor loading was low continuous and increasing feeding regimes an elevated rate of pha accumulation was observed an increase in pha accumulation from continuous feeding compared to pulse feeding was also reported in a recent study with low biomass loading rate of 3 5 5 5 cmol vfa cmol x d chen et al 2015 the authors of that study attribute the increase to self balanced ph state in the continuous feeding system however the impact on ph with feed addition was minimal in our study due to neutral ph of asl continuous feeding with asl led to a 7 4 increase in the hv content compared to the hourly feeding regime indicating that polymer composition may be manipulated via feeding strategy the progressively increasing and decreasing regimes also produced 5 3 and 4 0 greater hv content in pha compared to the hourly fed regime these increases are comparable with reports of 8 hv content increase when continuous feeding regimes were compared to pulse feeding of a mixed synthetic vfas substrate albuquerque et al 2011 although the pha synthesis is dependent on substrate uptake rates which are governed by the saturation kinetics as described by monod expression such an explicit relationship with substrate concentration was not observed in this study fig 5b maximum pha accumulation potential is biomass specific and depends on the culture enrichment efficacy however the do concentration and feeding regimen do influence the rate of pha accumulation as seen in fig 5b and c during the initial 3 h most of the carbon taken up is used for pha production subsequent carbon uptake is inefficient in terms of pha synthesis and directed towards cellular growth and maintenance requirements 3 4 pha yield on carbon yield provides the efficiency of conversion of a substrate to pha the pha yield rather than the maximum pha content in biomass is a critical parameter for assessing pha production most reported pha yields are based on vfa substrates with values of 0 77 0 80 cmol pha cmol vfa albuquerque et al 2011 0 4 cmol pha cmol vfa for a substrate derived by fermentation and pressurised thermal hydrolysis of waste activated sludge morgan sagastume et al 2010 0 48 0 68 cmol phb cmol acetate for synthetic substrate containing acetate as the sole carbon source third et al 2003 0 75 0 93 cmol phb cmol substrate containing butyrate marang et al 2013 and 0 25 0 44 cmol phv cmol vfa for paper mill wastewater with nutrient excess and nutrient limited conditions bengtsson et al 2008 the pha yields calculated for asl and lsl under the different do concentrations and feeding regimes are given in table 4 the effect of sampling and feed addition was considered in the calculation the highest yield for lsl was obtained under the lowest do saturation employed and the yield decreased with increasing do saturation results show that at lower do concentrations a greater proportion of consumed carbon is converted into pha under carbon limitation this is consistent with previous reports on do supply rates in acetate fed third et al 2003 and glycerol fed moralejo gárate et al 2013 sbrs a similar result is reported by pratt et al 2012 for a vfa fed bacterial enrichment they also concluded that the microaerophilic conditions decrease the pha production rates which are in accordance with the observations of this study under increased do concentrations a greater proportion of carbon is taken up but this is used for respiration and growth table 4 however for asl the pha yields increased with increasing do saturation table 4 it seems to be less incentive energetically for microorganisms to store carbon as pha under low do saturation and in the presence of abundant carbon the limited carbon taken up at the rate of 0 13 cmol cmol x h is mostly used for respiration and cell maintenance table 4 in the presence of high do flux and ample carbon the carbon uptake rate is high at 0 8 cmol cmol x h and more carbon is stored as pha this hypothesis needs further scientific verification via the modelling of cellular energetics feeding regimes also influenced the pha yield and the carbon uptake rates the progressively increasing feeding of asl and lsl liquors resulted in the highest yield and continuous addition of the two liquors resulted in the lowest pha yields when ample carbon and nutrients are available the incentive for storage polymer production is reduced and carbon is used for growth and respiration under limiting conditions a greater proportion of carbon is converted into pha approaching pha accumulating capacity of biomass the higher loading of substrate helped preserve the accumulated pha as well as accumulation of further pha at a lower rate the highest average specific pha productivity was obtained for asl continuous feeding regime which is consistent with prior reports albuquerque et al 2011 even with asl as substrate there was sufficient n as organic n and p in liquor and residual nutrients in the seed culture that resulted in sufficient nutrients for microbial growth to occur in the accumulation phase thus growth was not controlled by nutrient limitation as in most other studies which reduce the pha yield consequently the maximum pha yield obtained in this study was 0 50 cmol pha cmol substrate consumed compared to yields of 0 75 0 93 cmol pha cmol vfa in some other studies albuquerque et al 2011 marang et al 2013 the reduced yield values obtained in this study could be due to the substrate type used poor culture enrichment predation of pha producers by species such as bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and excessive microbial growth during the accumulation stage however the yield for asl was significantly higher than for lsl which can be attributed to the lower concentration of vfa carbon 4 conclusions we investigated for the first time the production of pha from nutrient rich wet oxidation liquors organic waste derived hydrothermal liquors were found to be a good substrate for pha production the enriched culture accumulated a maximum of 41 pha of dry cell weight containing 77 phb and 23 phv this is among the highest reported pha accumulations for substrates containing n and p rich hydrothermal liquors the enriched mixed bacterial culture contained a rarely reported bdellovibrio bacteriovorus species accounting for 3 5 of the total otus a known predator of gram negative pha producers strategies to improve pha yield on substrate in the two stage pha production process were investigated with two hydrothermal liquors controlling do in the accumulation stage was effective at diverting more carbon into pha production for low carbon concentration liquor substrates equal doses of substrate fed hourly at 25 do saturation was found to be the best conditions based on pha yield on substrate feeding regimes also affected the rate of pha accumulation and composition this suggests novel opportunities for manipulating polymer composition it is recommended that a residual carbon based feeding strategy be further investigated to reduce substrate

19523,a highly efficient electrolysis catalyzed ozone eco process was developed for n n dimethylacetamide dmac degradation the pseudo first order rate constants k obs of dmac degradation by eco process were 1 73 19 09 times greater than those by ozonation and electrolysis processes in a wide ph range of 3 0 10 0 interestingly we found o2 could be generated from ozone decomposition by a radical chain mechanism instead of monovalent reduction of o2 in eco system at the initial ph of 3 0 subsequently the h2o2 derived from o2 could participate in fenton like and peroxone reactions with the released fe2 from iron anode and the aerated o3 respectively therefore the extraordinary dmac removal efficiency was mainly caused by the more generation of oh through the multiple reactions of homogeneous catalytic ozonation fenton like and peroxone in eco system importantly the roles of involved reactions in eco system at various initial ph were quantitatively evaluated according to a series of trapping experiments the results reveal that the solution ph could significantly affect the contributions of various reactions and convert the reaction mechanisms of multiple reactions in eco system finally the degradation intermediates were detected to propose a possible dmac oxidation pathway in the eco system this work provides a deep insight into the quantitative analysis of the role of multiple oxidation reactions mechanism and the design of efficient electrochemical advanced oxidation technology for recalcitrant organic pollutant removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords

and internal micro electrolysis liu et al 2012 for instance a 500 ml of 50 mg l dmac aqueous solution was degraded by internal micro electrolysis the degradation efficiency of dmac was decreased with the elevation of initial solution ph from 3 0 to 8 0 liu et al 2012 but conventional processes are not efficient for complete dmac removal from industrial wastewater due to the highly resistant to biological and chemical degradation of dmac nowadays advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed as the effective alternative methods for the degradation of refractory pollutants these aops are based on the in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals oh which is a very powerful and nonselective oxidizing agent and can promote the degradation of a wide range of contaminants barrera díaz et al 2012 akbari et al 2016 thereinto combining with electrochemistry and ozone e g electro peroxone or photoelectron peroxone is one of the efficient processes due to its simplicity strong oxidation potential environment friendly and do not require addition reagent asaithambi et al 2012 li et al 2014 the electro peroxone process can drive the peroxone reaction the reaction between o3 and h2o2 via sparged o3 and o2 mixed gas into a reactor that has a carbon polytetrafluorethylene carbon ptfe cathode to in situ electro generated h2o2 eq 1 the generated h2o2 then reacts with the o3 to produce oh

carbon ptfe in electro peroxone systems are too expensive to limit the practical application therefore electrolysis ec using iron electrode combined with o3 electrolysis ozone was developed as a progressive process when o3 is aerated in the ec system fe2 acts as a catalyst for the ozone decomposition to generate oh meanwhile catalytic reaction of fe2 with o3 generates the intermediate feo2 a species that evolves to oh eqs 3 and 4 song et al 2008 akbari et al 2016 3 fe 2 o 3 feo 2 o 2 4 feo 2 h 2 o fe 3 oh oh although previous studies suggest that o3 assisted ec process was more effective than single ec and ozonation for wastewater treatment due to the synergistic effect of released fe2 and o3 song et al 2008 orescanin et al 2011 garcía garcía et al 2014 however these studies just only focused on the homogenous catalytic ozonation by released fe2 the possible formation of other reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide ion o2 and or h2o2 in o3 assisted ec process had not been reported the generation of h2o2 can induce the reactions of fenton like and peroxone in the presence of fe2 and o3 respectively thus explore the feasibility of h2o2 generation in o3 assisted ec system is urgent to preferably understand generating pathway of oh besides the relative contributions of catalytic ozonation fenton like and peroxone reactions toward dmac degradation in o3 assisted ec system has not been investigated yet to the best of our knowledge therefore it is of great importance to quantitatively analyze the role of above involved reactions and the generating pathway of oh in o3 assisted ec system herein o3 gas was aerated into ec system with iron plate electrode to construct a highly efficient electrolysis ozone eco system for dmac treatment in aqueous solution the main objectives of this study were to i investigate the effect of key operational parameters on removal efficiency of dmac by eco process ii explore the feasibility of o2 and h2o2 generation pathway in eco system iii quantitatively evaluate the contribution of catalytic ozonation fenton like and peroxone reactions toward dmac degradation by analyzing the generation of ros e g h2o2 oh and or o2 iv determine the degradation intermediates to propose a possible dmac oxidation pathway in eco system 2 material and methods 2 1 materials n n dimethylacetamide dmac and its five degradation products n

without further purification deionized water was used throughout the whole experiment process 2 2 experimental setup the degradation of dmac in eco process was carried out in a single electrolytic

meanwhile na2so4 as the supporting electrolyte 15 mmol l was added into the dmac aqueous solution the initial ph of dmac solution was 6 6 without adjustment the eco system was conducted under

aerated into the bottom of the reactor using a fine bubble diffuser at desired flow rate 100 500 ml min to ensure the complete fluidization of reaction solution the slurry was stirred by a mechanical stirrer 300 rpm the whole experiment process was performed at a running temperature of 25 1 c by heating in thermostatic bath for 60 min h2so4 or naoh 0 5 mol l was used to adjust the initial ph of solution to investigate the effect of initial ph e g 3 0 6 6 without adjustment 10 0 on the dmac degradation efficiency during the reaction process the samples were withdrawn at pre determined time intervals and filtered through a ptfe syringe filter disc 0 45 μm for analysis the concentration of dmac and dissolved iron concentrations in addition a separated electrochemical system was employed

and all points in the figures were the mean of the results and the error bars represented standard deviation of the means 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of dmac and degradation intermediates was achieved by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity agilent usa equipped with the eclipse xdb c 18 column 5 μm 250 4 6 mm agilent the mobile phase was composed of water with 0 1 h3po4 methanol and acetonitrile with the volume ratio of 60 20 20 samples were analyzed at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min and the injection volume was set as 10 μl detection was performed using a g1365mwd uv detector set at 204 nm furthermore to quantify the yield of oh benzoic acid was employed as a probe compound to capture oh joo et al 2004 the initial concentration of benzoic acid was 1000 mg l which was sufficient to capture all the generated oh benzoic acid could react with oh to produce three isomers of hydroxyl benzoic acid total hydroxybenzoic acid yield was calculated from this ratio by measuring para hydroxybenzoic acid p hba joo et al 2004 yi et al 2017 the concentrations of p hba was determined by hplc 1260 infinity agilent usa with the eclipse xdb c 18 column 5 μm 250 4 6 mm agilent and an ultraviolet detector wavelength 256 nm the mobile phase was composed of water with 0 1 h3po4 and acetonitrile with the volume ratio of 60 40 samples were analyzed at a

degradation efficiency of pollutants in all chemical oxidation processes herein three levels of ph i e 3 0 6 6 without adjustment and 10 0 were selected to evaluate the effect of initial ph on dmac degradation by different processes fig 1 shows the degradation curves of dmac under different initial ph by ec ozonation and eco processes as shown in fig 1 a it can be observed that less than 5 and 20 of dmac was degraded after 60 min of ec and ozonation treatment respectively in comparison all of the dmac were removed to below detection limit within 50 min by eco process additionally kinetic analysis indicates that the degradation of dmac by different treatment processes all were described by the pseudo first order and the correlation of determinations r2 were all greater than 0 91 as shown in fig 1 b at the initial ph of 3 0 the pseudo first order rate constant k obs for dmac degradation obtained by eco process 8 97 10 2 min 1 was about 69 and 26 times greater than those of single ec 0 13 10 2 min 1 and ozonation 0 34 10 2 min 1 process respectively these results suggest that the eco system was of high efficiency due to the synergistic effects of ec and ozonation in addition k obs for dmac degradation in eco system decreased from 8 97 10 2 to 3 74 10 2 min 1 with the increasing of initial ph to 10 0 fig 1 on the contrary fig 1 also shows that k obs in ozonation system increased from 0 34 10 2 to 2 14 10 2 min 1 with the increasing of initial ph which mainly due to the strongly ph dependence of ozone decomposition in water kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 on the other hand the dmac degradation in ec system was negligible within 60 min under whole initial ph range the slow degradation of dmac in ec system was attributed to the limitation of degradation kinetics by the mass transfer of dmac to the anode surface and dmac could not be efficient removal by coagulation of iron hydroxides in ec system to preferably understand the enhancement of dmac degradation in eco process the enhancement ratio f was calculated according to eq 5 weavers et al 1998 wang et al 2015a therefore f 1 indicates enhancement and f 1 indicates inhibition in the rate of the measured process also when f 0 the combined process is simply additive or cumulative 5 f k obs eco k obs ozone k obs ec fig s2 shows that f could achieve to 19 09 7 15 and 1 73 at the initial ph of 3 0 6 6 and 10 0 respectively this result provides robust evidence to demonstrate that eco system performed high efficiency for dmac degradation at overall examined ph values especially at acidic condition generally when iron is used as anode material fe2 is released from anode and many ionic monomeric hydrolysis species are formed depending on the ph of the solution khandegar and saroha 2013 the reactions taking place at electrodes in ec system are as follows song et al 2008 hernández ortega et al 2010 oxidation reaction takes place at the anode 6 fe s fe 2 aq 2 e reduction reaction takes place at the cathode 7 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 g 2 oh aq overall reaction during electrolysis 8 fe s 2 h 2 o l fe oh 2 s h 2 g in addition it is a well known fact that ozonation can proceed via two routes direct molecular ozone reactions and or indirect pathway to generate oh induced by the ozone decomposition in water nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 asaithambi et al 2012 the eco process can release fe2 to homogeneous catalyze ozone to produce oh eq 3 and 4 in order to evaluate the generation of oh for dmac degradation in both eco and ozonation systems benzoic acid was then used to quantify the generated oh fig 2 benzoic acid of a high initial concentration 1000 mg l was used to ensure all oh could be captured by benzoic acid wang et al 2015b fig 2 a shows that the generation of oh at different initial ph during 60 min of reaction in ozonation system it can be observed that the yield of oh achieved 226 4 μmol l at initial ph of 10 0 which much higher than others two cases 14 1 μmol l at ph 3 0 and 74 5 μmol l at ph 6 6 respectively this result indicates that ph value of the solution can significantly affect ozone decomposition and ozone decomposition occurs faster with an increase of ph in traditional ozonation system by contrast the concentration of cumulative oh at initial ph of 3 0 6 6 and 10 0 was 697 9 μmol l 523 5 μmol l and 392 5 μmol l respectively after 60 min of reaction in eco system fig 2 b the acidic condition stimulated iron anode to release more dissolved fe2 to participate in homogeneous catalytic ozonation generating more oh meanwhile the yield of oh in eco system was much higher than that of ozonation system at corresponding reaction condition this result demonstrates that much more oh could be generated inducing by homogeneous catalytic ozonation and provided the reason of high efficiency for dmac degradation at overall examined ph values in eco system in addition considering the indispensable role of fe2 to the generation of oh in homogeneous catalytic ozonation the variations of dissolved and total iron species were monitored under different initial ph in eco system fig 3 the amounts of dissolved fe2 were negligible at different initial ph owing to the rapid transformation of fe2 to fe3 and the subsequent formation of ferric hydroxides wang et al 2015b in contrast the dissolved fe3 concentrations gradually increased to 11 1 mg l and 2 0 mg l at initial ph of 3 0 and 6 6 respectively within 60 min in eco system fig 3 a this result indicates more dissolved fe2 was released in the reaction solution at strong acidic condition simultaneously the total iron ions in solution and precipitation were also determined under different initial ph in eco system fig 3 b the highest concentration 951 1 mg l of total iron ions at initial ph of 3 0 implied that strong acidic condition could stimulate iron anode to release more dissolved iron ions to participate in catalytic ozonation generating more oh and thus facilitating the dmac degradation this result also confirms that the more generation of oh at initial ph of 3 0 in eco system was attributed to the enhancement of ozone decomposition by the more released iron ions aforementioned results reveal that eco process can profoundly accelerate dmac degradation under specific conditions consequently additional sets of experiments should be performed to investigate the effects of additional factors such as applied current and ozone flow rate 3 2 effects of operating parameters on dmac degradation by eco process to get more insights into dmac degradation by eco system others key operating parameters such as applied current and ozone flow rate should be evaluated systematically the parametric optimization experiments demonstrated the eco process was more effective for dmac degradation under the conditions of initial ph 3 0 applied current 300 ma and ozone flow rate 300 ml min therefore these optimal conditions were selected to carry out the following experiments unless otherwise indicated details pertaining of this section are provided in the supporting information 3 3 the role of reactive oxidative species on dmac degradation in order to clarify the roles of reactive oxygen species ros on the dmac degradation in eco system a series of trapping experiments were carried out to compare the contribution of ros in eco system by adding excess tert butanol tba and isopropanol ipa oh scavenger catalase cat h2o2 scavenger and superoxide dismutase sod o2 scavenger as scavengers herein cat and sod were selected as scavengers for h2o2 and o2 rather than p nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and p benzoquinone due to their better stability and selectivity wang et al 2015b ding et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 a the dmac degradation was largely depressed by the addition of tba and ipa revealing the pivotal role of oh on the degradation of dmac interestingly the degradation rates of dmac also decreased after adding cat and sod indicating that h2o2 and o2 were also involved in eco system it can be observed from fig s5 and fig 4 b that k obs of dmac degradation was 8 97 10 2 min 1 in the absence of scavengers while k obs decreased to 0 87 10 2 min 1 0 40 10 2 min 1 5 44 10 2 min 1 and 5 81 10 2 min 1 in the presence of tba ipa cat and sod respectively to preferably manifest the contribution of different ros for dmac degradation the inhibitory efficiency η of different scavengers that had been proven to be useful in recent studies was estimated during the dmac degradation in eco system through eq 9 liu et al 2014 yi et al 2017 9 η k 0 k s k 0 100 where k 0 was the degradation rate constant in the absence of scavengers and k s was the degradation rate constant in the presence of scavengers the inhibitory efficiencies of tba ipa cat and sod were found to be 90 3 95 6 39 3 and 35 3 respectively it has long been known that the h2o2 can be electro generated on the suitable carbon based cathode follows a two electron transfer by dissolving o2 or air in the solution eq 1 enric brillas and oturan 2009 therefore h2o2 cannot directly generate on iron cathode in the reaction of ec system according to existing theories besides h2o2 can be indirectly generated by the single electron transfer derived from o2 in the presence of o2 eq 10 enric brillas and oturan 2009 hayyan et al 2016 there are two reduction paths for the generation of h2o2 derived from o2 one is the disproportionation of single electron reduced species o2 eq 11 and 12 and another is the reduction of o2 by photoinduced conduction band electrons eq 13 nosaka and nosaka 2017 10 o 2 e o 2 11 o 2 h ho 2 12 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 o 2 oh 13 o 2 2 h e h 2 o 2 however h2o2 cannot direct generate in the presence of iron cathode in this study we originally thought that the sequential single electron transfer route o2 o2 h2o2 oh was involved in the ros production due to the similar inhibitory efficiencies of cat and sod thus it could be supposed that the h2o2 might be generated from o2 that aerated with o3 in eco system according our hypothesis to verify the possibility of this hypothesis ec with pure oxygen aeration ec o2 for dmac degradation was carried out however only about 5 of dmac was degraded after 60 min of ec o2 treatment fig 5 a which was almost corresponding to the removal efficiency of single ec system this result indicates that fenton like reaction could not be commenced and h2o2 might not be generated in ec o2 system subsequently the concentrations of h2o2 in eco and ec o2 systems were compared to further confirm the generation pathway of h2o2 it is important to emphasize that detecting the real yield of h2o2 in the presence of fe2 is difficult due to the quick h2o2 decomposition catalyzed by fe2 at initial ph of 3 0 then the accumulative concentrations of h2o2 in eco and ec o2 systems were measured by replacing the iron anode with a ti ruo2 iro2 plate electrode which did not catalyze the direct decomposition of h2o2 fig s1 b yuan et al 2011 wang et al 2015b it was found that the h2o2 concentration increased to 227 5 μmol l in eco system while the accumulative concentrations of h2o2 approached zero in ec o2 system fig 5 b furthermore the concentrations of h2o2 in the presence of iron anode approached zero in both eco and ec o2 systems fig 5 c as expected which due to the quick decomposition of h2o2 by fe2 released from the iron anode these results provide the direct evidence to confirm that h2o2 cannot be generated in ec o2 system and then negated the hypothesis that h2o2 was generated from o2 in eco system therefore we deem that the generation of o2 and h2o2 were derived from ozone decomposition this decomposition of ozone occurs by a radical chain mechanism through the reaction between hydroxyl ions oh and ozone eq 14 buehler et al 1984 staehelin et al 1984 ozone decomposition proceeds through the following five step chain reactions kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 hernández ortega et al 2010 mehrjouei et al 2015 14 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 15 2 ho 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 16 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 17 o 3 h ho 3 18 ho 3 o 2 oh during the course of ozone decomposition h2o2 forms from the bimolecular decay reaction of o2 zhang et al 2011 the apparent bimolecular rate constant k obs for o2 to generate h2o2 is ph dependent eq 11 and 12 the k obs becomes largest at around ph 5 and decreases with the increase of ph as expressed by k obs 6 1012 ph m 1 s 1 nosaka and nosaka 2017 the oh could be continuously generated from iron cathode in eco system according to eq 7 and then ozone decomposition with oh could be sharply promoted in the presence of electrolysis in this study at ph 3 the second order rate constant for the reaction of o2 with o3 is about two orders of magnitude smaller than at higher ph therefore the disproportionation of o2 to form h2o2 and the reaction of o2 with o3 to form oh would took place competitively in eco system as a result o2 and h2o2 could be generated in the current reaction condition e g initial ph of 3 0 of this study in eco system in order to verify whether ozone react with oh to form o2 could be promoted in the presence of electrolysis degradation of dmac in ozonation system with the addition of sod to scavenge o2 was carried out the result was shown in fig s6 it can be observed that the degradation rate of dmac was almost coincident both by ozonation with or without sod this result indicates that o2 was not involved at initial ph of 3 0 in ozonation system additionally the accumulative concentration of h2o2 in ozonation system was much lower than that of eco system under corresponding conditions fig 5 c these phenomena indicates that the electrolysis took part in the radical chain reactions of ozone decomposition enhancing the formation of o2 and h2o2 consequently o2 and h2o2 could be generated in eco system under initial ph of 3 0 and o2 as an intermediate to form h2o2 then the generated h2o2 could be involved in fenton like and peroxone reactions with the released fe2 and the aerated o3 respectively as a result much more oh could be generated inducing by fenton like and peroxone reactions eq 2 and 19 19 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 3 4 quantitative evaluation the role of various reactions in eco system under different initial ph above analysis results reveal h2o2 could be generated in eco system for dmac degradation at initial ph of 3 0 catalytic ozonation fenton like peroxone reactions coagulation and direct molecule ozone reaction could be performed in eco system due to the interaction among released fe2 generated h2o2 and aerated o3 therefore it is urgent to quantitatively analyze the contributions of these reactions to preferably shed light on the degradation mechanisms for dmac degradation in eco system at initial ph of 3 0 in this study it is important to emphasize that the proportion of pseudo first order rate constant k obs of each reaction in whole eco system k obs 8 97 10 2 min 1 was used to evaluate the contribution of these reactions first of all in view of the indispensable role of coagulation in eco system the concentrations of total iron ions were monitored to evaluate the amount of generated ferric hydroxides in both ec and eco systems the concentrations of total iron ions were almost keep the similar growth trend in both ec and eco systems and the concentrations of total iron ions in effluent were 946 2 mg l and 951 1 mg l after 60 min of ec and eco treatment respectively fig s7 in consideration of the similar amount of ferric hydroxides formed in both ec and eco systems the contribution of coagulation removal rate of dmac in eco system might be represented by the removal rate in ec system since the coagulation might be the sole reaction involved in ec system the k obs of dmac obtained by ec and eco systems were 0 13 10 2 min 1 and 8 97 10 2 min 1 respectively fig 1 b therefore it can be approximately calculated that the contribution of coagulation was 1 4 in eco system subsequently the contribution of direct molecule ozone reaction could be calculated by the proportion of oh 95 6 and coagulation 1 4 in whole eco system and the result of the calculation was about 3 0 in order to further confirm the scientificity of this result by using simple subtraction the degradation of dmac with the addition of ipa was compared in eco and ozonation systems this method is intent to eliminate the leading role of oh in both eco and ozonation systems as shown in fig s8 a only 17 of dmac was degraded in ozonation in the presence of ipa which less than that of eco with ipa besides k obs obtained in eco system with ipa 0 40 10 2 min 1 was higher than that of ozonation with ipa 0 29 10 2 min 1 fig s8 b this phenomenon was mainly ascribed to the enhanced ozone transfer and coagulation removal of dmac in eco system with ipa therefore the role of direct molecule ozone reaction for dmac degradation can be evaluated by calculating the proportion of ozonation with ipa in eco system and the result of the calculation is about 3 2 the error 0 2 between the different calculation methods is acceptable due to the experimental errors therefore the difference value 3 0 was used to evaluate the contribution of direct molecule ozone reaction for dmac degradation in eco system furthermore in consideration of the indispensable role of fe2 to the generation of oh in fenton like and homogeneous catalytic ozonation the iron anode was replaced with a ti ruo2 iro2 plate electrode as the measurement method of h2o2 fig s1 b it can be observed that only peroxone reaction and direct molecule ozone reaction were involved in eco system without iron anode as shown in fig s9 a the dmac degradation was largely depressed without released fe2 revealing the main role of fe2 in the generation of oh for the degradation of dmac meanwhile fig s9 b shows the k obs of ti ruo2 iro2 plate anode was declined to 0 96 10 2 min 1 which demonstrates that the contribution of peroxone reaction and direct molecule ozone reaction were about 10 7 and then the contribution of peroxone reaction was about 7 7 10 7 3 0 of direct molecule ozone reaction on the other hand the coagulation fenton like reaction and homogeneous catalytic ozonation could not involve in the eco system with ti ruo2 iro2 plate anode since the absence of the released fe2 thus the contribution of fenton like reaction and homogeneous catalytic ozonation was about 87 9 100 7 7 of peroxone reaction 3 0 of direct molecule ozone reaction 1 4 of coagulation besides fig 4 b shows that the role of h2o2 was about 39 3 by addition of cat in eco system it is well known that the h2o2 was involved in fenton like and peroxone reactions therefore it can be calculated that the contribution of fenton like and peroxone reactions was about 39 3 in eco system then the contribution of fenton like reaction could be calculated and the result was 31 6 39 3 7 7 of peroxone reaction subsequently the contribution of catalytic ozonation was about 56 3 87 9 31 6 of fenton like reaction aforementioned analysis reveals the different roles of involved reactions for dmac treatment in eco system under the optimal conditions on the basis of above results and analysis the initiative and reactive species and the contribution of various reactions involved in eco system were summarized in table 1 additionally the generation pathway of h2o2 and the role of all reaction mechanisms involved in the eco process at initial ph of 3 0 were illustrated clearly in fig 6 firstly o2 and h2o2 could be generated from ozone decomposition under initial ph of 3 0 and o2 as an intermediate to form h2o2 then the generated h2o2 could be involved in fenton like and peroxone reactions with the released fe2 from iron anode and the aerated o3 respectively simultaneously the released fe2 could catalyze ozone decomposition to induce homogeneous ozonation and the released fe2 could be oxidized to fe3 which can precipitates as iron hydroxide to removal dmac by coagulation in particular the role of catalytic ozonation fenton like peroxone direct molecule ozone reaction and coagulation were about 56 3 31 6 7 7 3 0 and 1 4 respectively in order to evaluate the contributions of the involved reactions under different ph conditions a series of trapping experiments were implemented under initial ph of 6 6 and 10 0 respectively the results and analysis demonstrates that the homogenous catalytic ozonation 69 5 and peroxone reaction 16 8 were the pivotal reactions under initial ph of 6 6 and the homogenous catalytic ozonation 84 5 and direct molecule ozone reaction 12 6 were the dominating reactions under initial ph of 10 0 in eco system for dmac degradation these phenomena also reveal that the solution ph could significantly affect the reaction mechanisms of multiple reactions in eco system finally details pertaining of the experiments and analysis of this section are provided in the supporting information 3 5 intermediate analysis and degradation pathways two different pathways have been proposed for the degradation of dmac in the first pathway dmac splits to dimethylamine dma and acetic acid dma is further transformed to monomethylamine mma hasegawa et al 1997 veeranagouda et al 2006 chen et al 2017 in the second pathway dmac is degraded by sequential oxidative demethylations leading to the generation of n methylacetamide acetamide and acetic acid princivalle et al 2010 ge et al 2012 chen et al 2017 to get more insight on the degradation pathway of dmac five possible oxidation intermediates n methyl n hydroxymethylacetamide n methylacetamide n hydroxymethylacetamide acetamide and acetic acid generated from the dmac decomposition during the two different oxidation processes eco and ozonation systems were detected by hplc analyses fig 7 it is important to emphasize that dma and mma could not be detected in eco and ozonation systems the intermediates identified in eco or ozonation process were generally the same as those reported in the previous studies on dmac degradation ge et al 2012 chen et al 2017 during the dmac degradation in the eco system all the five intermediates appeared at the early stage fig 7 a in particular the concentrations of n methyl n hydroxymethylacetamide n methylacetamide and n hydroxymethylacetamide increased to maximum values and then decreased gradually during 60 min of eco process treatment concurrently with the fast degradation of dmac a certain amount of acetamide and acetic acid were generated in eco system the concentrations of acetamide and acetic acid were substantially elevated to their highest concentrations and then reached a relative plateau in eco system in contrast the concentrations of these five intermediates increased much more slowly during the whole dmac degradation process in ozonation system the complete degradation of these intermediates would spend much more time fig 7 b apparently the faster degradation of dmac and its intermediates further confirms that the higher ozone mass transfer and higher ozone decomposition rate to oh in eco system compared with ozonation system the initial reaction step in dmac degradation by eco process can be mainly ascribed to the oh attack of dmac a series of mainly oh induced reactions such as hydroxylation demethylation and deamination would be involved in eco system for dmac treatment which lead to the degradation of dmac and generation of intermediates based on the above results and analysis a possible dmac degradation pathway during eco treatment was proposed in fig 8 the dmac was firstly oxidized to n methyl n hydroxymethylacetamide through hydroxylation of oh attack and then transformed into n methylacetamide with the shedding of hydroxymethyl groups via demethylation the n methylacetamide was further oxidized to n hydroxymethylacetamide via hydroxylation of oh attack and then transformed into acetamide through sequentially demethylation with the shedding of hydroxymethyl groups chen et al 2017 subsequently the acetamide could transform to acetic acid via deamination by consecutive oh attack ultimately most of the acetic acid was oxidized by oh to co2 and h2o accomplishing the degradation of dmac in addition in order to confirm the possibility of existence of unidentified intermediates total organic carbon toc values were determined before and after ozone and eco systems treatment at initial ph of 3 0 firstly the toc theoretical value of initial dmac 200 mg l and the identified intermediates after 120 min of single ozone and eco processes treatment are 110 2 mg l 108 2 mg l and 66 4 mg l respectively the determined initial toc of dmac 200 mg l was 109 6 mg l and the residual toc after 120 min of single ozone and eco processes reaction were 107 4 mg l and 65 9 mg l respectively this result indicates that dmac could approximately be degraded to above identified intermediates by eco process and there is barely unidentified intermediates remain in effluent after 120 min of eco system treatment besides fig 7 a shows that there is a downward trend for the concentration of the identified intermediates and a continued reaction can accomplish the completely mineralization 3 6 the use of electro generated sludge above all the morphology and composition of the electro generated sludge after 60 min of reaction in eco system under optimal conditions were analyzed by sem eds fig 9 it can be observed that the electro generated sludge exhibited to be amorphous in shape meanwhile the eds spectrum shows that three main elements e g o 51 4 wt fe 38 7 wt c 7 8 wt were observed on the surface of electro generated sludge the formation of sludge is the issue in many iron based technologies due to the generation of iron hydroxides such as in electrocoagulation with iron electrode zero valence iron and fenton like systems it s an urgent problem to solve that how to properly use and dispose the iron sludge the electro generated sludge of eco contains iron hydroxides that can be considered for different applications such as the addition agent in cement production and or building industry for resource utilization in full scale wastewater treatment since the catalytic actions of the electro generated metal ions are advantageous the reuse of electro generated iron sludge as a catalyst for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation and or fenton like reaction is a relatively appropriate method akbari et al 2016 to this end the electro generated iron hydroxides in eco system was recycled in a new reactor with previous property without ec set up but merely aerated o3 the electro generated sludge was separated and added to 200 mg l dmac aqueous solution initial ph of 3 0 and ozone 300 ml min was continuously dispersed into the reacting solution the result of the experiment was presented in fig s14 it can be observed that more than 30 of dmac was degraded after 60 min of sludge ozone treatment which was higher than that of ozonation 20 this phenomenon demonstrates that the electro generated sludge could effectively catalyze ozone decomposition in comparison with application of ozone alone therefore the reuse of electro generated sludge for catalyze ozone decomposition can be a simple and promising way for alleviation of sludge disposing and handling problems 4 conclusion in summary dmac can be effectively degraded by the eco process under a variety of tested reaction conditions the extraordinary efficiency was mainly caused by the more generation of oh derived from multiple oxidation reactions including catalytic ozonation fenton like and peroxone in eco system comparing the ros generated in eco system the h2o2 derived from o2 could be involved in fenton like and peroxone reactions with the released fe2 and the aerated o3 respectively importantly the evaluation of multiple reactions contribution reveals that the homogenous catalytic ozonation 56 3 and fenton like reaction 31 6 were the pivotal reactions under initial ph of 3 0 the homogenous catalytic ozonation 69 5 and peroxone reaction 16 8 were the pivotal reactions under initial ph of 6 6 and the homogenous catalytic ozonation 84 5 and direct molecule ozone reaction 12 6 were the dominating reactions under initial ph of 10 0 in eco system for dmac degradation furthermore electro generated sludge in eco system could effectively catalyze ozone decomposition in comparison with application of ozone alone therefore the eco process may have great potential to improve the treatment efficiency of existing ozonation and ec processes both of which are widely used in wastewater treatment acknowledgement the

19523,a highly efficient electrolysis catalyzed ozone eco process was developed for n n dimethylacetamide dmac degradation the pseudo first order rate constants k obs of dmac degradation by eco process were 1 73 19 09 times greater than those by ozonation and electrolysis processes in a wide ph range of 3 0 10 0 interestingly we found o2 could be generated from ozone decomposition by a radical chain mechanism instead of monovalent reduction of o2 in eco system at the initial ph of 3 0 subsequently the h2o2 derived from o2 could participate in fenton like and peroxone reactions with the released fe2 from iron anode and the aerated o3 respectively therefore the extraordinary dmac removal efficiency was mainly caused by the more generation of oh through the multiple reactions of homogeneous catalytic ozonation fenton like and peroxone in eco system importantly the roles of involved reactions in eco system at various initial ph were quantitatively evaluated according to a series of trapping experiments the results reveal that the solution ph could significantly affect the contributions of various reactions and convert the reaction mechanisms of multiple reactions in eco system finally the degradation intermediates were detected to propose a possible dmac oxidation pathway in the eco system this work provides a deep insight into the quantitative analysis of the role of multiple oxidation reactions mechanism and the design of efficient electrochemical advanced oxidation technology for recalcitrant organic pollutant removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords n n dimethylacetamide ozone electrolysis reactive oxygen species quantitative analysis reaction mechanism 1 introduction n n dimethylacetamide dmac is an important organic polar solvent widely used in the chemical industry especially in the manufacture of synthetic leather polymer dissolution and fiber industry and also as a reagent in the production of medical intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry li et al 2009 ghazali and inayat hussain 2014 jia et al 2017 due to the wide use of dmac in industry a large amount of industrial wastewater with different concentrations of dmac is produced in 2000 the production of dmac worldwide was estimated to be from 50 000 to 60 000 tons per year ghazali and inayat hussain 2014 the ecotoxicological testing results indicate that dmac is not acutely toxic to aquatic organisms but very toxic to earthworms oechtering et al 2006 ghazali and inayat hussain 2014 dmac also has been listed as a chemical to cause reproductive toxicity ghazali and inayat hussain 2014 potential human exposure to dmac through inhalation of vapors or skin contact with the liquid substance in the workplace may cause skin irritation headache inappetence fatigue and hepatic damage ge et al 2012 ghazali and inayat hussain 2014 chen et al 2017 the current permissible exposure limit is 10 ppm assigned by the us occupational safety and health administration princivalle et al 2010 ghazali and inayat hussain 2014 in view of its wide presence toxicity and recalcitrance dmac has an adverse effect on the environment and public health if the dmac wastewater is directly discharged into the environment princivalle et al 2010 ge et al 2012 with the aggravation of environmental pollution many countermeasures have been developed to remove dmac contamination from the industrial effluents the technologies mainly include biodegradation chen et al 2017 sorptive microextraction li et al 2009 photocatalytic oxidation ge et al 2012 adsorption takatsuji and yoshida 1998 and internal micro electrolysis liu et al 2012 for instance a 500 ml of 50 mg l dmac aqueous solution was degraded by internal micro electrolysis the degradation efficiency of dmac was decreased with the elevation of initial solution ph from 3 0 to 8 0 liu et al 2012 but conventional processes are not efficient for complete dmac removal from industrial wastewater due to the highly resistant to biological and chemical degradation of dmac nowadays advanced oxidation processes aops have been developed as the effective alternative methods for the degradation of refractory pollutants these aops are based on the in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals oh which is a very powerful and nonselective oxidizing agent and can promote the degradation of a wide range of contaminants barrera díaz et al 2012 akbari et al 2016 thereinto combining with electrochemistry and ozone e g electro peroxone or photoelectron peroxone is one of the efficient processes due to its simplicity strong oxidation potential environment friendly and do not require addition reagent asaithambi et al 2012 li et al 2014 the electro peroxone process can drive the peroxone reaction the reaction between o3 and h2o2 via sparged o3 and o2 mixed gas into a reactor that has a carbon polytetrafluorethylene carbon ptfe cathode to in situ electro generated h2o2 eq 1 the generated h2o2 then reacts with the o3 to produce oh

carbon ptfe in electro peroxone systems are too expensive to limit the practical application therefore electrolysis ec using iron electrode combined with o3 electrolysis ozone was developed as a progressive process when o3 is aerated in the ec system fe2 acts as a catalyst for the ozone decomposition to generate oh meanwhile catalytic reaction of fe2 with o3 generates the intermediate feo2 a species that evolves to oh eqs 3 and 4 song et al 2008 akbari et al 2016 3 fe 2 o 3 feo 2 o 2 4 feo 2 h 2 o fe 3 oh oh although previous studies suggest that o3 assisted ec process was more effective than single ec and ozonation for wastewater treatment due to the synergistic effect of released fe2 and o3 song et al 2008 orescanin et al 2011 garcía garcía et al 2014 however these studies just only focused on the homogenous catalytic ozonation by released fe2 the possible formation of other reactive oxygen species ros such as superoxide ion o2 and or h2o2 in o3 assisted ec process had not been reported the generation of h2o2 can induce the reactions of fenton like and peroxone in the presence of fe2 and o3 respectively thus explore the feasibility of h2o2 generation in o3 assisted ec system is urgent to preferably understand generating pathway of oh besides the relative contributions of catalytic ozonation fenton like and peroxone reactions toward dmac degradation in o3 assisted ec system has not been investigated yet to the best of our knowledge therefore it is of great importance to quantitatively analyze the role of above involved reactions and the generating pathway of oh in o3 assisted ec system herein o3 gas was aerated into ec system with iron plate electrode to construct a highly efficient electrolysis ozone eco system for dmac treatment in aqueous solution the main objectives of this study were to i investigate the effect of key operational parameters on removal efficiency of dmac by eco process ii explore the feasibility of o2 and h2o2 generation pathway in eco system iii quantitatively evaluate the contribution of catalytic ozonation fenton like and peroxone reactions toward dmac degradation by analyzing the generation of ros e g h2o2 oh and or o2 iv determine the degradation intermediates to propose a possible dmac oxidation pathway in eco system 2 material and methods 2 1 materials n n dimethylacetamide dmac and its five degradation products n

aerated into the bottom of the reactor using a fine bubble diffuser at desired flow rate 100 500 ml min to ensure the complete fluidization of reaction solution the slurry was stirred by a mechanical stirrer 300 rpm the whole experiment process was performed at a running temperature of 25 1 c by heating in thermostatic bath for 60 min h2so4 or naoh 0 5 mol l was used to adjust the initial ph of solution to investigate the effect of initial ph e g 3 0 6 6 without adjustment 10 0 on the dmac degradation efficiency during the reaction process the samples were withdrawn at pre determined time intervals and filtered through a ptfe syringe filter disc 0 45 μm for analysis the concentration of dmac and dissolved iron concentrations in addition a separated electrochemical system was employed to evaluate the individual contribution of fe2 on the dmac degradation by replaced iron anode to ti ruo2 iro2 anode 12 0 cm 5 0 cm 0 1 cm fig s1 b all experiments were run in duplicates or triplicates and all points in the figures were the mean of the results and the error bars represented standard deviation of the means 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of dmac and degradation intermediates was achieved by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity agilent usa equipped with the eclipse xdb c 18 column 5 μm 250 4 6 mm agilent the mobile phase was composed of water with 0 1 h3po4 methanol and acetonitrile with the volume ratio of 60 20 20 samples were analyzed at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min and the injection volume was set as 10 μl detection was performed using a g1365mwd uv detector set at 204 nm furthermore to quantify the yield of oh benzoic acid was employed as a probe compound to capture oh joo et al 2004 the initial concentration of benzoic acid was 1000 mg l which was sufficient to capture all the generated oh benzoic acid could react with oh to produce three isomers of hydroxyl benzoic acid total hydroxybenzoic acid yield was calculated from this ratio by measuring para hydroxybenzoic acid p hba joo et al 2004 yi et al 2017 the concentrations of p hba was determined by hplc 1260 infinity agilent usa with the eclipse xdb c 18 column 5 μm 250 4 6 mm agilent and an ultraviolet detector wavelength 256 nm the mobile phase was composed of water with 0 1 h3po4 and acetonitrile with the volume ratio of 60 40 samples were analyzed at a

spectroscopy eds s 3500n hitachi japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics for dmac degradation under different initial ph by different processes the solution ph can significantly affect the degradation efficiency of pollutants in all chemical oxidation processes herein three levels of ph i e 3 0 6 6 without adjustment and 10 0 were selected to evaluate the effect of initial ph on dmac degradation by different processes fig 1 shows the degradation curves of dmac under different initial ph by ec ozonation and eco processes as shown in fig 1 a it can be observed that less than 5 and 20 of dmac was degraded after 60 min of ec and ozonation treatment respectively in comparison all of the dmac were removed to below detection limit within 50 min by eco process additionally kinetic analysis indicates that the degradation of dmac by different treatment processes all were described by the pseudo first order and the correlation of determinations r2 were all greater than 0 91 as shown in fig 1 b at the initial ph of 3 0 the pseudo first order rate constant k obs for dmac degradation obtained by eco process 8 97 10 2 min 1 was about 69 and 26 times greater than those of single ec 0 13 10 2 min 1 and ozonation 0 34 10 2 min 1 process respectively these results suggest that the eco system was of high efficiency due to the synergistic effects of ec and ozonation in addition k obs for dmac degradation in eco system decreased from 8 97 10 2 to 3 74 10 2 min 1 with the increasing of initial ph to 10 0 fig 1 on the contrary fig 1 also shows that k obs in ozonation system increased from 0 34 10 2 to 2 14 10 2 min 1 with the increasing of initial ph which mainly due to the strongly ph dependence of ozone decomposition in water kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 on the other hand the dmac degradation in ec system was negligible within 60 min under whole initial ph range the slow degradation of dmac in ec system was attributed to the limitation of degradation kinetics by the mass transfer of dmac to the anode surface and dmac could not be efficient removal by coagulation of iron hydroxides in ec system to preferably understand the enhancement of dmac degradation in eco process the enhancement ratio f was calculated according to eq 5 weavers et al 1998 wang et al 2015a therefore f 1 indicates enhancement and f 1 indicates inhibition in the rate of the measured process also when f 0 the combined process is simply additive or cumulative 5 f k obs eco k obs ozone k obs ec fig s2 shows that f could achieve to 19 09 7 15 and 1 73 at the initial ph of 3 0 6 6 and 10 0 respectively this result provides robust evidence to demonstrate that eco system performed high efficiency for dmac degradation at overall examined ph values especially at acidic condition generally when iron is used as anode material fe2 is released from anode and many ionic monomeric hydrolysis species are formed depending on the ph of the solution khandegar and saroha 2013 the reactions taking place at electrodes in ec system are as follows song et al 2008 hernández ortega et al 2010 oxidation reaction takes place at the anode 6 fe s fe 2 aq 2 e reduction reaction takes place at the cathode 7 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 g 2 oh aq overall reaction during electrolysis 8 fe s 2 h 2 o l fe oh 2 s h 2 g in addition it is a well known fact that ozonation can proceed via two routes direct molecular ozone reactions and or indirect pathway to generate oh induced by the ozone decomposition in water nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 asaithambi et al 2012 the eco process can release fe2 to homogeneous catalyze ozone to produce oh eq 3 and 4 in order to evaluate the generation of oh for dmac degradation in both eco and ozonation systems benzoic acid was then used to quantify the generated oh fig 2 benzoic acid of a high initial concentration 1000 mg l was used to ensure all oh could be captured by benzoic acid wang et al 2015b fig 2 a shows that the generation of oh at different initial ph during 60 min of reaction in ozonation system it can be observed that the yield of oh achieved 226 4 μmol l at initial ph of 10 0 which much higher than others two cases 14 1 μmol l at ph 3 0 and 74 5 μmol l at ph 6 6 respectively this result indicates that ph value of the solution can significantly affect ozone decomposition and ozone decomposition occurs faster with an increase of ph in traditional ozonation system by contrast the concentration of cumulative oh at initial ph of 3 0 6 6 and 10 0 was 697 9 μmol l 523 5 μmol l and 392 5 μmol l respectively after 60 min of reaction in eco system fig 2 b the acidic condition stimulated iron anode to release more dissolved fe2 to participate in homogeneous catalytic ozonation generating more oh meanwhile the yield of oh in eco system was much higher than that of ozonation system at corresponding reaction condition this result demonstrates that much more oh could be generated inducing by homogeneous catalytic ozonation and provided the reason of high efficiency for dmac degradation at overall examined ph values in eco system in addition considering the indispensable role of fe2 to the generation of oh in homogeneous catalytic ozonation the variations of dissolved and total iron species were monitored under different initial ph in eco system fig 3 the amounts of dissolved fe2 were negligible at different initial ph owing to the rapid transformation of fe2 to fe3 and the subsequent formation of ferric hydroxides wang et al 2015b in contrast the dissolved fe3 concentrations gradually increased to 11 1 mg l and 2 0 mg l at initial ph of 3 0 and 6 6 respectively within 60 min in eco system fig 3 a this result indicates more dissolved fe2 was released in the reaction solution at strong acidic condition simultaneously the total iron ions in solution and precipitation were also determined under different initial ph in eco system fig 3 b the highest concentration 951 1 mg l of total iron ions at initial ph of 3 0 implied that strong acidic condition could stimulate iron anode to release more dissolved iron ions to participate in catalytic ozonation generating more oh and thus facilitating the dmac degradation this result also confirms that the more generation of oh at initial ph of 3 0 in eco system was attributed to the enhancement of ozone decomposition by the more released iron ions aforementioned results reveal that eco process can profoundly accelerate dmac degradation under specific conditions consequently additional sets of experiments should be performed to investigate the effects of additional factors such as applied current and ozone flow rate 3 2 effects of operating parameters on dmac degradation by eco process to get more insights into dmac degradation by eco system others key operating parameters such as applied current and ozone flow rate should be evaluated systematically the parametric optimization experiments demonstrated the eco process was more effective for dmac degradation under the conditions of initial ph 3 0 applied current 300 ma and ozone flow rate 300 ml min therefore these optimal conditions were selected to carry out the following experiments unless otherwise indicated details pertaining of this section are provided in the supporting information 3 3 the role of reactive oxidative species on dmac degradation in order to clarify the roles of reactive oxygen species ros on the dmac degradation in eco system a series of trapping experiments were carried out to compare the contribution of ros in eco system by adding excess tert butanol tba and isopropanol ipa oh scavenger catalase cat h2o2 scavenger and superoxide dismutase sod o2 scavenger as scavengers herein cat and sod were selected as scavengers for h2o2 and o2 rather than p nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and p benzoquinone due to their better stability and selectivity wang et al 2015b ding et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 a the dmac degradation was largely depressed by the addition of tba and ipa revealing the pivotal role of oh on the degradation of dmac interestingly the degradation rates of dmac also decreased after adding cat and sod indicating that h2o2 and o2 were also involved in eco system it can be observed from fig s5 and fig 4 b that k obs of dmac degradation was 8 97 10 2 min 1 in the absence of scavengers while k obs decreased to 0 87 10 2 min 1 0 40 10 2 min 1 5 44 10 2 min 1 and 5 81 10 2 min 1 in the presence of tba ipa cat and sod respectively to preferably manifest the contribution of different ros for dmac degradation the inhibitory efficiency η of different scavengers that had been proven to be useful in recent studies was estimated during the dmac degradation in eco system through eq 9 liu et al 2014 yi et al 2017 9 η k 0 k s k 0 100 where k 0 was the degradation rate constant in the absence of scavengers and k s was the degradation rate constant in the presence of scavengers the inhibitory efficiencies of tba ipa cat and sod were found to be 90 3 95 6 39 3 and 35 3 respectively it has long been known that the h2o2 can be electro generated on the suitable carbon based cathode follows a two electron transfer by dissolving o2 or air in the solution eq 1 enric brillas and oturan 2009 therefore h2o2 cannot directly generate on iron cathode in the reaction of ec system according to existing theories besides h2o2 can be indirectly generated by the single electron transfer derived from o2 in the presence of o2 eq 10 enric brillas and oturan 2009 hayyan et al 2016 there are two reduction paths for the generation of h2o2 derived from o2 one is the disproportionation of single electron reduced species o2 eq 11 and 12 and another is the reduction of o2 by photoinduced conduction band electrons eq 13 nosaka and nosaka 2017 10 o 2 e o 2 11 o 2 h ho 2 12 o 2 ho 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 o 2 oh 13 o 2 2 h e h 2 o 2 however h2o2 cannot direct generate in the presence of iron cathode in this study we originally thought that the sequential single electron transfer route o2 o2 h2o2 oh was involved in the ros production due to the similar inhibitory efficiencies of cat and sod thus it could be supposed that the h2o2 might be generated from o2 that aerated with o3 in eco system according our hypothesis to verify the possibility of this hypothesis ec with pure oxygen aeration ec o2 for dmac degradation was carried out however only about 5 of dmac was degraded after 60 min of ec o2 treatment fig 5 a which was almost corresponding to the removal efficiency of single ec system this result indicates that fenton like reaction could not be commenced and h2o2 might not be generated in ec o2 system subsequently the concentrations of h2o2 in eco and ec o2 systems were compared to further confirm the generation pathway of h2o2 it is important to emphasize that detecting the real yield of h2o2 in the presence of fe2 is difficult due to the quick h2o2 decomposition catalyzed by fe2 at initial ph of 3 0 then the accumulative concentrations of h2o2 in eco and ec o2 systems were measured by replacing the iron anode with a ti ruo2 iro2 plate electrode which did not catalyze the direct decomposition of h2o2 fig s1 b yuan et al 2011 wang et al 2015b it was found that the h2o2 concentration increased to 227 5 μmol l in eco system while the accumulative concentrations of h2o2 approached zero in ec o2 system fig 5 b furthermore the concentrations of h2o2 in the presence of iron anode approached zero in both eco and ec o2 systems fig 5 c as expected which due to the quick decomposition of h2o2 by fe2 released from the iron anode these results provide the direct evidence to confirm that h2o2 cannot be generated in ec o2 system and then negated the hypothesis that h2o2 was generated from o2 in eco system therefore we deem that the generation of o2 and h2o2 were derived from ozone decomposition this decomposition of ozone occurs by a radical chain mechanism through the reaction between hydroxyl ions oh and ozone eq 14 buehler et al 1984 staehelin et al 1984 ozone decomposition proceeds through the following five step chain reactions kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 hernández ortega et al 2010 mehrjouei et al 2015 14 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 15 2 ho 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 16 o 2 o 3 o 2 o 3 17 o 3 h ho 3 18 ho 3 o 2 oh during the course of ozone decomposition h2o2 forms from the bimolecular decay reaction of o2 zhang et al 2011 the apparent bimolecular rate constant k obs for o2 to generate h2o2 is ph dependent eq 11 and 12 the k obs becomes largest at around ph 5 and decreases with the increase of ph as expressed by k obs 6 1012 ph m 1 s 1 nosaka and nosaka 2017 the oh could be continuously generated from iron cathode in eco system according to eq 7 and then ozone decomposition with oh could be sharply promoted in the presence of electrolysis in this study at ph 3 the second order rate constant for the reaction of o2 with o3 is about two orders of magnitude smaller than at higher ph therefore the disproportionation of o2 to form h2o2 and the reaction of o2 with o3 to form oh would took place competitively in eco system as a result o2 and h2o2 could be generated in the current reaction condition e g initial ph of 3 0 of this study in eco system in order to verify whether ozone react with oh to form o2 could be promoted in the presence of electrolysis degradation of dmac in ozonation system with the addition of sod to scavenge o2 was carried out the result was shown in fig s6 it can be observed that the degradation rate of dmac was almost coincident both by ozonation with or without sod this result indicates that o2 was not involved at initial ph of 3 0 in ozonation system additionally the accumulative concentration of h2o2 in ozonation system was much lower than that of eco system under corresponding conditions fig 5 c these phenomena indicates that the electrolysis took part in the radical chain reactions of ozone decomposition enhancing the formation of o2 and h2o2 consequently o2 and h2o2 could be generated in eco system under initial ph of 3 0 and o2 as an intermediate to form h2o2 then the generated h2o2 could be involved in fenton like and peroxone reactions with the released fe2 and the aerated o3 respectively as a result much more oh could be generated inducing by fenton like and peroxone reactions eq 2 and 19 19 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 3 4 quantitative evaluation the role of various reactions in eco system under different initial ph above analysis results reveal h2o2 could be generated in eco system for dmac degradation at initial ph of 3 0 catalytic ozonation fenton like peroxone reactions coagulation and direct molecule ozone reaction could be performed in eco system due to the interaction among released fe2 generated h2o2 and aerated o3 therefore it is urgent to quantitatively analyze the contributions of these reactions to preferably shed light on the degradation mechanisms for dmac degradation in eco system at initial ph of 3 0 in this study it is important to emphasize that the proportion of pseudo first order rate constant k obs of each reaction in whole eco system k obs 8 97 10 2 min 1 was used to evaluate the contribution of these reactions first of all in view of the indispensable role of coagulation in eco system the concentrations of total iron ions were monitored to evaluate the amount of generated ferric hydroxides in both ec and eco systems the concentrations of total iron ions were almost keep the similar growth trend in both ec and eco systems and the concentrations of total iron ions in effluent were 946 2 mg l and 951 1 mg l after 60 min of ec and eco treatment respectively fig s7 in consideration of the similar amount of ferric hydroxides formed in both ec and eco systems the contribution of coagulation removal rate of dmac in eco system might be represented by the removal rate in ec system since the coagulation might be the sole reaction involved in ec system the k obs of dmac obtained by ec and eco systems were 0 13 10 2 min 1 and 8 97 10 2 min 1 respectively fig 1 b therefore it can be approximately calculated that the contribution of coagulation was 1 4 in eco system subsequently the contribution of direct molecule ozone reaction could be calculated by the proportion of oh 95 6 and coagulation 1 4 in whole eco system and the result of the calculation was about 3 0 in order to further confirm the scientificity of this result by using simple subtraction the degradation of dmac with the addition of ipa was compared in eco and ozonation systems this method is intent to eliminate the leading role of oh in both eco and ozonation systems as shown in fig s8 a only 17 of dmac was degraded in ozonation in the presence of ipa which less than that of eco with ipa besides k obs obtained in eco system with ipa 0 40 10 2 min 1 was higher than that of ozonation with ipa 0 29 10 2 min 1 fig s8 b this phenomenon was mainly ascribed to the enhanced ozone transfer and coagulation removal of dmac in eco system with ipa therefore the role of direct molecule ozone reaction for dmac degradation can be evaluated by calculating the proportion of ozonation with ipa in eco system and the result of the calculation is about 3 2 the error 0 2 between the different calculation methods is acceptable due to the experimental errors therefore the difference value 3 0 was used to evaluate the contribution of direct molecule ozone reaction for dmac degradation in eco system furthermore in consideration of the indispensable role of fe2 to the generation of oh in fenton like and homogeneous catalytic ozonation the iron anode was replaced with a ti ruo2 iro2 plate electrode as the measurement method of h2o2 fig s1 b it can be observed that only peroxone reaction and direct molecule ozone reaction were involved in eco system without iron anode as shown in fig s9 a the dmac degradation was largely depressed without released fe2 revealing the main role of fe2 in the generation of oh for the degradation of dmac meanwhile fig s9 b shows the k obs of ti ruo2 iro2 plate anode was declined to 0 96 10 2 min 1 which demonstrates that the contribution of peroxone reaction and direct molecule ozone reaction were about 10 7 and then the contribution of peroxone reaction was about 7 7 10 7 3 0 of direct molecule ozone reaction on the other hand the coagulation fenton like reaction and homogeneous catalytic ozonation could not involve in the eco system with ti ruo2 iro2 plate anode since the absence of the released fe2 thus the contribution of fenton like reaction and homogeneous catalytic ozonation was about 87 9 100 7 7 of peroxone reaction 3 0 of direct molecule ozone reaction 1 4 of coagulation besides fig 4 b shows that the role of h2o2 was about 39 3 by addition of cat in eco system it is well known that the h2o2 was involved in fenton like and peroxone reactions therefore it can be calculated that the contribution of fenton like and peroxone reactions was about 39 3 in eco system then the contribution of fenton like reaction could be calculated and the result was 31 6 39 3 7 7 of peroxone reaction subsequently the contribution of catalytic ozonation was about 56 3 87 9 31 6 of fenton like reaction aforementioned analysis reveals the different roles of involved reactions for dmac treatment in eco system under the optimal conditions on the basis of above results and analysis the initiative and reactive species and the contribution of various reactions involved in eco system were summarized in table 1 additionally the generation pathway of h2o2 and the role of all reaction mechanisms involved in the eco process at initial ph of 3 0 were illustrated clearly in fig 6 firstly o2 and h2o2 could be generated from ozone decomposition under initial ph of 3 0 and o2 as an intermediate to form h2o2 then the generated h2o2 could be involved in fenton like and peroxone reactions with the released fe2 from iron anode and the aerated o3 respectively simultaneously the released fe2 could catalyze ozone decomposition to induce homogeneous ozonation and the released fe2 could be oxidized to fe3 which can precipitates as iron hydroxide to removal dmac by coagulation in particular the role of catalytic ozonation fenton like peroxone direct molecule ozone reaction and coagulation were about 56 3 31 6 7 7 3 0 and 1 4 respectively in order to evaluate the contributions of the involved reactions under different ph conditions a series of trapping experiments were implemented under initial ph of 6 6 and 10 0 respectively the results and analysis demonstrates that the homogenous catalytic ozonation 69 5 and peroxone reaction 16 8 were the pivotal reactions under initial ph of 6 6 and the homogenous catalytic ozonation 84 5 and direct molecule ozone reaction 12 6 were the dominating reactions under initial ph of 10 0 in eco system for dmac degradation these phenomena also reveal that the solution ph could significantly affect the reaction mechanisms of multiple reactions in eco system finally details pertaining of the experiments and analysis of this section are provided in the supporting information 3 5 intermediate analysis and degradation pathways two different pathways have been proposed for the degradation of dmac in the first pathway dmac splits to dimethylamine dma and acetic acid dma is further transformed to monomethylamine mma hasegawa et al 1997 veeranagouda et al 2006 chen et al 2017 in the second pathway dmac is degraded by sequential oxidative demethylations leading to the generation of n methylacetamide acetamide and acetic acid princivalle et al 2010 ge et al 2012 chen et al 2017 to get more insight on the degradation pathway of dmac five possible oxidation intermediates n methyl n hydroxymethylacetamide n methylacetamide n hydroxymethylacetamide acetamide and acetic acid generated from the dmac decomposition during the two different oxidation processes eco and ozonation systems were detected by hplc analyses fig 7 it is important to emphasize that dma and mma could not be detected in eco and ozonation systems the intermediates identified in eco or ozonation process were generally the same as those reported in the previous studies on dmac degradation ge et al 2012 chen et al 2017 during the dmac degradation in the eco system all the five intermediates appeared at the early stage fig 7 a in particular the concentrations of n methyl n hydroxymethylacetamide n methylacetamide and n hydroxymethylacetamide increased to maximum values and then decreased gradually during 60 min of eco process treatment concurrently with the fast degradation of dmac a certain amount of acetamide and acetic acid were generated in eco system the concentrations of acetamide and acetic acid were substantially elevated to their highest concentrations and then reached a relative plateau in eco system in contrast the concentrations of these five intermediates increased much more slowly during the whole dmac degradation process in ozonation system the complete degradation of these intermediates would spend much more time fig 7 b apparently the faster degradation of dmac and its intermediates further confirms that the higher ozone mass transfer and higher ozone decomposition rate to oh in eco system compared with ozonation system the initial reaction step in dmac degradation by eco process can be mainly ascribed to the oh attack of dmac a series of mainly oh induced reactions such as hydroxylation demethylation and deamination would be involved in eco system for dmac treatment which lead to the degradation of dmac and generation of intermediates based on the above results and analysis a possible dmac degradation pathway during eco treatment was proposed in fig 8 the dmac was firstly oxidized to n methyl n hydroxymethylacetamide through hydroxylation of oh attack and then transformed into n methylacetamide with the shedding of hydroxymethyl groups via demethylation the n methylacetamide was further oxidized to n hydroxymethylacetamide via hydroxylation of oh attack and then transformed into acetamide through sequentially demethylation with the shedding of hydroxymethyl groups chen et al 2017 subsequently the acetamide could transform to acetic acid via deamination by consecutive oh attack ultimately most of the acetic acid was oxidized by oh to co2 and h2o accomplishing the degradation of dmac in addition in order to confirm the possibility of existence of unidentified intermediates total organic carbon toc values were determined before and after ozone and eco systems treatment at initial ph of 3 0 firstly the toc theoretical value of initial dmac 200 mg l and the identified intermediates after 120 min of single ozone and eco processes treatment are 110 2 mg l 108 2 mg l and 66 4 mg l respectively the determined initial toc of dmac 200 mg l was 109 6 mg l and the residual toc after 120 min of single ozone and eco processes reaction were 107 4 mg l and 65 9 mg l respectively this result indicates that dmac could approximately be degraded to above identified intermediates by eco process and there is barely unidentified intermediates remain in effluent after 120 min of eco system treatment besides fig 7 a shows that there is a downward trend for the concentration of the identified intermediates and a continued reaction can accomplish the completely mineralization 3 6 the use of electro generated sludge above all the morphology and composition of the electro generated sludge after 60 min of reaction in eco system under optimal conditions were analyzed by sem eds fig 9 it can be observed that the electro generated sludge exhibited to be amorphous in shape meanwhile the eds spectrum shows that three main elements e g o 51 4 wt fe 38 7 wt c 7 8 wt were observed on the surface of electro generated sludge the formation of sludge is the issue in many iron based technologies due to the generation of iron hydroxides such as in electrocoagulation with iron electrode zero valence iron and fenton like systems it s an urgent problem to solve that how to properly use and dispose the iron sludge the electro generated sludge of eco contains iron hydroxides that can be considered for different applications such as the addition agent in cement production and or building industry for resource utilization in full scale wastewater treatment since the catalytic actions of the electro generated metal ions are advantageous the reuse of electro generated iron sludge as a catalyst for heterogeneous catalytic ozonation and or fenton like reaction is a relatively appropriate method akbari et al 2016 to this end the electro generated iron hydroxides in eco system was recycled in a new reactor with previous property without ec set up but merely aerated o3 the electro generated sludge was separated and added to 200 mg l dmac aqueous solution initial ph of 3 0 and ozone 300 ml min was continuously dispersed into the reacting solution the result of the experiment was presented in fig s14 it can be observed that more than 30 of dmac was degraded after 60 min of sludge ozone treatment which was higher than that of ozonation 20 this phenomenon demonstrates that the electro generated sludge could effectively catalyze ozone decomposition in comparison with application of ozone alone therefore the reuse of electro generated sludge for catalyze ozone decomposition can be a simple and promising way for alleviation of sludge disposing and handling problems 4 conclusion in summary dmac can be effectively degraded by the eco process under a variety of tested reaction conditions the extraordinary efficiency was mainly caused by the more generation of oh derived from multiple oxidation reactions including catalytic ozonation fenton like and peroxone in eco system comparing the ros generated in eco system the h2o2 derived from o2 could be involved in fenton like and peroxone reactions with the released fe2 and the aerated o3 respectively importantly the evaluation of multiple reactions contribution reveals that the homogenous catalytic ozonation 56 3 and fenton like reaction 31 6 were the pivotal reactions under initial ph of 3 0 the homogenous catalytic ozonation 69 5 and peroxone reaction 16 8 were the pivotal reactions under initial ph of 6 6 and the homogenous catalytic ozonation 84 5 and direct molecule ozone reaction 12 6 were the dominating reactions under initial ph of 10 0 in eco system for dmac degradation furthermore electro generated sludge in eco system could effectively catalyze ozone decomposition in comparison with application of ozone alone therefore the eco process may have great potential to improve the treatment efficiency of existing ozonation and ec processes both of which are widely used in wastewater treatment acknowledgement the

19524,a wide variety of inhibitors can induce anaerobic digester disruption to avoid performance losses support media can be used to mitigate inhibitions however distinguishing the physico chemical from the biological mechanisms of such strategies remains delicate in this framework the impact of 10 g l of different types of zeolites and activated carbons ac on microbial community dynamics during anaerobic digestion of biowaste in the presence of 1 3 g l of phenol was evaluated with 16 s rrna gene sequencing in the presence of ac methanogenesis inhibition was rapidly removed due to a decrease of phenol concentration this abiotic effect related to the physico chemical properties of ac led to increased final ch4 and co2 productions by 29 31 compared to digesters incubated without support interestingly although zeolite did not adsorb phenol final ch4 and co2 production reached comparable levels as with ac nevertheless compared to digesters incubated without support methanogenesis lag phase duration was less reduced in the presence of zeolites 5 1 days than in the presence of activated carbons 12 2 days both types of support induced biotic effects ac and zeolite both allowed the preservation of the major representative archaeal genus of the non inhibited ecosystem methanosarcina by contrast they distinctly shaped bacterial populations otus belonging to class w5 became dominant at the expense of otus assigned to orders clostridiales bacteroidales and anaerolinales in the presence of ac zeolite enhanced the implantation of otus assigned to bacterial phylum cloacimonetes this study highlighted that supports can induce biotic and abiotic effects within digesters inhibited with phenol showing potentialities to enhance anaerobic digestion stability under disrupting conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords methanization inhibition zeolite activated carbon 16s rrna gene sequencing anaerobic digester 1 introduction due to population and economic growth the production of organic waste is increasing worldwide moreover new international regulations push the development of sustainable economically and environmentally attractive technologies that allow a proper valorization of this waste anaerobic digestion ad is a well known option that can efficiently treat organic waste providing value added compounds such as methane holm nielsen et al 2009 moreover ad has lower costs and environmental impacts when compared to other treatment options such as landfilling incineration or composting however this bioprocess still remains vulnerable to a wide variety of inhibitory substances that induce poor operational stability preventing ad wide commercialization chen et al 2008 among ad inhibitors various phenolic compounds are mentioned as the primary cause of digester failure in particular phenol is often recovered in various ad substrates containing humic acids tannins or xenobiotic compounds such as pesticides it is regularly detected at concentrations reaching up to several grams per liter in different types of effluents from petrochemical or paper industry rosenkranz et al 2013 many operational strategies have been developed to limit microbiota disruption by phenol including bioaugmentation with resistant microorganisms microbial acclimation trace element addition dilution and co digestion hajji et al 2000 madigou et al 2016 some support media such as activated carbon are also used in fluidized bed digesters for their physico chemical properties to adsorb phenol lao 2002 recent studies highlighted that support media additions within anaerobic digesters could result in increased biogas production despite the presence of inhibitors by specifically shaping the ecosystem milan et al 2010 mumme et al 2014 among these support media zeolite addition has been mainly used to counteract ammonia inhibition within anaerobic digesters it was proven to specifically enhance the growth of ammonia tolerant methanogens such as methanoculleus montalvo et al 2012 weiss et al 2013 furthermore electrically conductive materials such as biochar or activated carbon are known to promote interspecies electron exchange and to enhance specific electro active microorganisms improving ad performance lee et al 2016 lu et al 2016 consequently support media could be either used for their physico chemical effect or for their biotic effect towards microbial ecosystem nevertheless even if the benefits of such strategies on digestion performance have been investigated the underlying effects of support media towards microorganisms are still poorly known especially under inhibitory conditions therefore besides these technological improvements new research should be carried out not only to compare and optimize these strategies but also to provide a better understanding of the influence of different type of supports on key phylotypes steering the microbial community towards enhanced biodegradation performance a previous study revealed that different types of supports such as zeolites and activated carbon could induce contrasted effects on ad performance under extreme ammonia inhibition without modifying ammonia concentration poirier et al 2017 moreover it highlighted their specific microbiological effect on different archaeal and bacterial groups the present investigation comes in line with this previous work by assessing the effects of the same support media on anaerobic digestion performance and on microbial communities in the presence of another inhibitor the phenol interestingly activated carbon is known to adsorb phenol while zeolites have lower adsorption properties yousef et al 2011 therefore this study aims at comparing the biotic and abiotic effects of the different support media on phenol inhibition mitigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a total of 30 batch digesters glass plasma bottles of 1 l working volume of 500 ml were seeded with 20 g of centrifuged

inoculum was sampled from a 50 l laboratory anaerobic bioreactor incubated at 35 c during 20 days this reactor had been previously inoculated with 20 l of methanogenic sludge collected from a full

of 500 ml all incubations were performed in triplicate four support media that were also used in poirier et al 2017 were separately added within batch digesters 2 zeolites and 2 activated carbons support media main characteristics are presented in table 1 zeolite 1 was mainly composed of chabazite 60 while zeolite 2 was mainly composed of clinoptilolite 80 activate carbon 1 was untreated with a surface of 600 800 m2 g while activated carbon 2 600 m2 g was acid washed by the manufacturer control assays without support were also implemented before being added into the digesters at a concentration of 10 g l zeolites and activated carbons were sifted in order to obtain a comparable grain size comprised between 0 5 mm and 1 mm a first set of 15 bioreactors was inhibited with phenol phenol 99 acros organics waltham usa was added to reach a concentration of 1 3 g l corresponding to 25 of the initial cod provided by the inoculum and the biowaste this concentration was selected on the base of a previous work which showed that this inhibition level was sufficient to impair ad performance without completely disrupting methanogenesis poirier et al 2016a a second set of 15 bioreactors was used as a non inhibited control in order to assess the effect of the different support media in absence of phenol bioreactors were subsequently sealed with a screw cap and a rubber septum and headspaces were flushed with n2 purity 99 99 linde gas sa munich germany to ensure anaerobic conditions time zero samples were collected before starting incubation of the reactors at 35 c without agitation in the dark liquid samples 8 ml were periodically collected through the septum and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min the pellets and supernatants thus obtained were stored separately at 20 c for analysis of biomass and chemical indicators respectively digestion tests were run until the daily biogas productions of each reactor decreased below 10 ml 2 2 analytical methods

effect of zeolites and activated carbons on anaerobic digestion performance 3 1 1 phenol concentration dynamics phenol concentration dynamics are presented in fig 1 throughout the experiment phenol concentration decreased down less than 0 01 g l in all the bioreactors without support phenol concentration dropped from 1 3 to 0 1 g l between day 39 and day 60 it confirmed that this inoculum was able to resist and to completely degrade this phenol concentration even without any support addition poirier et al 2016a interestingly times after which phenol concentration started to decrease were strongly influenced by the type of support present in the digester after 3 days of incubation phenol concentration dropped in all digesters supplemented with activated carbons these support media are widely used for their adsorption properties dąbrowski et al 2005 therefore it can be assumed that phenol was quickly adsorbed on activated carbons surface interestingly activated carbon 1 seemed to better adsorb phenol than activated carbon 2 indeed after 7 days of incubation phenol decrease was circa 2 fold higher in the presence of activated carbon 1 this could be related to the higher surface of activated carbon 1 600 800 m2 g compared to activated carbon 2 600 m2 g however after 16 days phenol was not detected anymore in all incubations with activated carbons it was thus hypothesized that it was completely adsorbed on these support media phenol concentration remained stable circa its initial level 1 3 g l up to 39 days of incubation in both triplicates of digesters incubated with zeolites 1 and 2 this result evidenced that phenol was not adsorbed on zeolites nevertheless compared to the control phenol degradation was enhanced by the presence of zeolites after 50 days 83 and 71 of the initial phenol concentration was respectively degraded in the presence of zeolites 1 and 2 while at the same date only 26 were degraded in the control digesters incubated without support therefore it can be assumed that zeolites accelerated phenol degradation confirming the beneficial effect of zeolites on ad in the presence of 1 3 g l of phenol 3 1 2 biogas production kinetics average cumulated ch4 and co2 productions of each triplicate of reactors are presented in fig 2 those obtained with digesters incubated without phenol are detailed in supplementary fig s1 three kinetic parameters ultimate production maximum production rate and lag time calculated by fitting cumulative production curves with gompertz equation for both gases are shown in supplementary table s1 in the control experiment without phenol regardless of supports addition ch4 and co2 production kinetics remained relatively similar indicating that supports did not seem to significantly affect biogas production performance under non inhibiting conditions figure s1 in the presence of phenol without support ultimate co2 and ch4 production 1880 27 ml and 3200 86 ml respectively reached comparable levels as under non inhibiting conditions 1713 45 ml and 3134 78 ml respectively however ch4 lag phase duration increased by 12 days while co2 and ch4 maximum production rates were reduced by 43 and 45 respectively consequently it takes respectively circa 47 and 12 supplementary days to produce the same amount of ch4 and co2 as under non inhibitory conditions on the contrary all the incubations with supports and phenol equally led to higher ultimate co2 and ch4 production than control digesters incubated without phenol it can be explained by the degradation of phenol into biogas as already described chapleur et al 2016 however this was not observed in incubations with phenol but without support media this could be due to the fact that without support phenol was degraded in other potentially inhibiting metabolites such as benzoate and benzoyl coa that were not quantified but not completely metabolized into biogas during the course of the experiment hoyos hernandez et al 2014 schink et al 2000 at this concentration level this was already observed by chapleur et al 2016 it suggests that either support media had a beneficial effect on phenol degradation into biogas or that activated carbons and zeolites adsorbed accumulated metabolites produced during phenol degradation suppressing thus their inhibitory effect however to our knowledge no study reported yet the sorption of phenol degradation metabolites by zeolites or activated carbon interestingly ch4 and co2 maximum production rates were specifically influenced by the type of support added in the digesters both zeolites equally mitigated phenol inhibition and enhanced substrate degradation to biogas compared to digesters without support ch4 lag phase duration was reduced by 5 days while ch4 and co2 ultimate yields both increased by circa 22 and 29 respectively probably because of complete phenol degradation through biogas since this support did not have any physicochemical effect on phenol adsorption in the digesters it suggests that zeolites may also have beneficial effects on anaerobic digestion microbial community weiss et al 2013 hypothesized that this support has a biotic impact by providing suitable mineral micro habitats for biomass immobilization other authors suggested that zeolites could release beneficial trace elements montalvo et al 2012 however regarding supplementary figure s1 these biotic effects seem to be only detectable in our case while the microbiota is inhibited since without inhibitor no significant improvement was observed in biogas production performance activated carbons better alleviated phenol inhibition than zeolites compared to digesters without support in the presence of these supports ch4 and co2 maximum production rates as well as ch4 lag phase were comparable to those observed under non inhibiting conditions furthermore both support media led to a similar increase of 23 26 and 29 31 of maximum ch4 and co2 ultimate yields respectively corresponding to the already mentioned phenol degradation into biogas accordingly to phenol dynamics contrasted results were noticed between both supports particularly ch4 production started 3 days earlier in the presence of activated carbon 1 than with activated carbon 2 moreover maximum ch4 and co2 production rates were also circa 10 higher with activated carbon 1 consequently biogas production kinetics were significantly faster with this support than with activated carbon 2 suggesting that both activated carbons distinct characteristics could play a role in their influence on ad microbiome it confirmed that activated carbon 1 better adsorbed phenol than activated carbon 2 which could lead to the delayed biogas production kinetics observed with this support 3 1 3 vfa concentration dynamics acetate propionate and butyrate were detected in all the incubations vfa concentration dynamics are presented in supplementary material fig s2 contrary to non inhibiting conditions not shown supports had a significant effect on vfa dynamics in the presence of phenol without support phenol led to higher levels of acetate and butyrate than in the presence of different support media the absence of support also induced longer degradation phases for all vfas including propionate these results suggested that phenol mainly inhibited vfa degraders while producers did not seem to be impaired at this concentration vfa concentration kinetics also confirmed previous observation made on ch4 production kinetics support media all mitigated vfa degradation inhibition but with various efficiencies activated carbons led to better vfas degradation than zeolites furthermore activated carbon 1 even led to vfa degradation dynamics comparable to those observed under non inhibiting conditions in our previous work poirier et al 2016a phenol also impaired acetate and propionate maximum concentrations while butyrate production was not significantly inhibited delays in acetate and propionate degradation in the presence of 1 3 g l of phenol had been attributed to the inhibition of vfa degraders such as acetotrophic archaeal ch4 producers which were initially present in the inoculum in this work acetate and propionate degradation seemed to occur concomitantly with phenol degradation for all support media it can thus be hypothesized that these vfa degraders were inhibited by phenol once phenol level decreased they became active again and allowed vfa degradation and biogas production this result has already been described by many authors chapleur et al 2016 wirth et al 2015 3 2 effect of zeolites and activated carbons on microbial communities exposed to phenol inhibition microbial community dynamics patterns were investigated with 16 s rrna gene high throughput sequencing the objective was to assess the potential influence of each support on microbial community composition and identify key microorganisms involved in structural modifications of the microbiota a total of 23 samples were selected depending on biogas production kinetics advancement 17 in the presence of 1 3 g l of phenol and 5 under non inhibiting conditions one sample was used to characterize the initial microbial composition of the digesters several thousands of sequences were identified for each sample they were assembled into 527 and 12 otus for bacteria and archaea respectively due to the large number of bacterial otus relative abundances were aggregated at the family level for stacked bar plot representation otus belonging to the same archaeal genus or to the same bacterial order were represented with the same color palette archaeal and bacterial composition of digesters incubated under non inhibiting conditions after 16 days of incubation when ch4 production rate was maximal are presented in stacked bar plots in supplementary figure s3 3 2 1 archaeal and bacterial dynamics throughout the incubation 3 2 1 1 archaea archaeal community composition dynamics were represented in stacked bar plots at the otu level in fig 3 samples were aggregated by support initially added and by sampling date methanogenic archaea detected in the inoculum mainly belonged to otus assigned to genus methanolinea ml1 and genus methanosarcina msc1 with respective relative abundances of 28 and 52 remaining minor otus were assigned to genus methanoculleus 6 and genus methanobacterium 3 without support phenol greatly inhibited the otu affiliated to genus methanosarcina msc1 its abundance decreased down to 11 after 7 days of incubation data not shown while genus methanolinea remained predominant within the microbiota 55 throughout the incubation methanosarcina otu1 msc1 gained importance within the microbiota after 31 days while ch4 production started methanosarcina otu1 msc1 was predominant with a relative abundance of 84 this percentage remained stable during the most active ch4 production phase from day 31 up to day 50 indicating that the microbiota evolved toward a stable and efficient composition dominated by this single otu which managed to overcome the inhibition archaeal composition of the digesters incubated with support media indicated that the delay caused by phenol in ch4 production kinetics seemed to be highly correlated with the emergence of methanosarcina otu1 msc1 genus methanosarcina has been reported as a sign of process stability by many studies de vrieze et al 2012 lins et al 2014 moset et al 2015 its predominance within all the digesters incubated with 1 3 g l of phenol suggested that this genus was able after a certain period depending on the inhibitor concentration and the type of support added in the digester to overcome this stress conditions and produce ch4 moreover its growth seems to be correlated with the decrease of acetate concentration in the bioreactors since this archaeal genus is known to use acetate to produce ch4 it can be hypothesized that methanosarcina emerged at the expense of other genera thanks to its ability to consume acetate in the presence of zeolites genus methanosarcina otu1 msc1 was less inhibited than without support after 7 days its relative abundance only dropped to 30 moreover after 23 days of incubation it already re increased up to 70 varying between 70 and 82 for both zeolites throughout the experiment hence zeolites did not affect the final composition of the archaeal community but they seemed to accelerate its evolution by preserving methanosarcina otu1 msc1 from phenol inhibition it can also be hypothesized that zeolite pores were preferentially colonized by methanosarcina thanks to the presence of trace elements suitable for its growth it was already reported by different studies milán et al 2010 showed that magnesium zeolite stimulated the presence of methanosarcina within batch digesters treating winery wastewater weiss et al 2011 demonstrated that activated zeolites i e clinoptilolites were mainly colonized by methanosarcina barkeri and methanoculleus bourgensis during anaerobic digestion of grass silage weiss et al 2011 moreover methanosarcinaceae also colonized zeolite fixed bed digester treating chicken waste ziganshina et al 2015 in the presence of activated carbons methanosarcina was not inhibited by phenol since after only 16 days its relative abundance was circa 70 77 this was probably due to the sorption of phenol on the surface of these support media that limited its presence in the liquid phase which let methanosarcina otu1 msc1 grow 3 2 1 2 bacteria bacterial relative abundances were represented at the family level in stacked bar plots in fig 4 most of the bacterial otus recovered in the initial mix consisting in inoculum and biowaste belonged to family lactobacillaceae lact 53 to an unassigned family belonging to w5 class uw5 9 to anaerolinaceae anae 8 and to families from orders clostridiales 10 and bacteroidales 8 lactobacillaceae were not detectable throughout the experiment by contrast orders bacteroidales and clostridiales both emerged to become predominant in the microbiota their global relative abundances reached circa 41 61 in all digesters during the incubation however the composition of these orders greatly varied regarding the type of support added in the bioreactor order bacteroidales mainly consisted in family porphyromonadaceae porp this family was suggested to play an important role in the degradation of the accumulated volatile fatty acids regueiro et al 2014 without support its relative abundance reached 28 before slightly decreasing down to 21 at day 50 interestingly in thepresence of supports its proportion dropped down to 11 14 by day 39 indicated its potential relation with the degree of inhibition of the microbiota moreover diversity within order bacteroidales seemed to be more important in the presence of activated carbons this was mainly attributed to the specific emergence of family marinilabiaceae mrnl which increased up to 6 9 suggesting that this family could better grow if phenol concentration decreased rapidly in the digester by contrast in the presence of activated carbons the proportion of otus assigned to order clostridiales was reduced members of this order have been recognized to hydrolyze a variety of polysaccharides by different mechanisms due to their capacity to process a wide range of substrates their importance has been stood out by many authors ali shah et al 2014 carballa et al 2015 total abundance of this order remained between 17 and 25 throughout the experiment in the presence of activated carbons while it varied from 25 to 35 without support and with zeolites this difference was mostly attributed to the subsequent emergence of family lachnospiraceae lacn and syntrophomonadaceae synt lachnospiraceae were mostly recovered in the earliest days suggesting their involvement in the early steps of biowaste degradation while they were progressively replaced by syntrophomonadaceae their respective relative abundances reached 13 18 and 17 19 in incubations without support and with zeolites while it remained below 5 in the presence of activated carbons syntrophomonadaceae family has already been associated with efficient acetogenic performance notably because they are known to degrade butyrate to acetate carballa et al 2015 hence it could be hypothesized that these families played a key role in ad process ranging from hydrolysis to acetogenesis syntrophomonadaceae could also be involved in phenol degradation poirier et al 2016b in the presence of activated carbons phenol concentration quickly decreased and probably shaped different interactions within the microbiota involving less otus belonging to order clostridiales interestingly both activated carbons promoted the emergence of otus assigned to family spirochaetaceae spir relative abundance of this family remained below 2 in all other digesters while it reached 6 for both activated carbons a recent study evidenced that spirochaetales were clearly involved in sao with hydrogenotrophic methanogens lee et al 2015 it suggested that sao could be maintained in absence of activated carbons due to a possible functional redundancy between syntrophomonadaceae and spirochaetaceae furthermore the proportion of otus assigned to anaerolinaceae seemed to be correlated with the degree of inhibition of the digesters without support the proportion of this family increased from 11 to 27 while with zeolites it increased from 10 13 to 17 18 and only to 5 9 with activated carbons nevertheless members of this family have not been correlated to different process parameters yet all these observations tended to indicate that the duration of the inhibition strongly influenced bacterial community activated carbons induced a quick decrease of the stress level that led to bacterial shifts and probably to the implementation of new syntrophic interactions with archaea and particularly with methanosarcina which dominated the archaeal community by contrast zeolites did not have a significant influence on bacterial populations except on family anaerolinaceae by reducing its emergence 3 2 2 statistical analyses revealed specific populations associated with support media principal component analysis pca and sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis sparse plsda were performed to statistically analyze archaea and bacteria 16 s rrna gene tags in order to identify specific populations associated with the different support media for the sake of clarity t0 sample which was collected to characterize the initial mix as well as t2 sample day 7 which was too different from the rest of the samples were not included in this analysis in order to evidence potential patterns in sparse plsda representation samples were clustered by type of support media initially added zeolites and activated carbons key phylotypes phylogenetic assignation was abbreviated for these representations 3 2 2 1 archaea in order to support observations made on the stacked bar plot representation pca was performed with these data and is presented in supplementary figure s4 this unsupervised statistical analysis confirmed that archaeal community was governed by three major otus assigned to methanosarcina msc1 methanoculleus mc1 and methanolinea ml1 samples collected in the earliest days of incubation were predominated by methanolinea ml1 and methanoculleus mc1 which were present in the inoculum but not considered as active during the incubation while throughout the experiment all final archaeal compositions were dominated by methanosarcina msc1 which seems to be the only ch4 producer since dominant archaeal populations were relatively similar in the different digesters pca did not highlight any clear specific influence of support addition moreover due to the very low number of sequences assigned to minor archaeal otus 50 in the total dataset complementary supervised statistical method sparse plsda aiming at identifying any potential effect of support on sub dominant populations was not performed on the same dataset rna based methods such as metatranscriptomics could be more appropriate to assess the activity of sub dominant methanogenic populations within the microbiota 3 2 2 2 bacteria pca was also performed on 16 s bacterial abundance table and presented in supplementary figure s5 for this unsupervised statistical analysis otus were aggregated at the family level samples distribution revealed that activated carbons played a key role in shaping bacterial populations it confirmed that bacterial dynamics within digesters incubated with these support media were tightly related to the presence of otus assigned to families marinilabiaceae mrnl spirochaetaceae spir and to an unassigned family belonging to order w5 uw5 and to peptococcaceae pptc by contrast zeolites addition did not seem to significantly influence bacterial composition compared to the digester without support similarly to observations made on the stacked bar plots the correlation circle tended to link these latter digesters with families affiliated to lachnospiraceae lacn syntrophomonadaceae synt and anaerolinaceae anae in order to confirm these first observations and to identify key otus responsible for this distribution sparse plsda was performed without aggregating the dataset at the family level heatmap of the most discriminant otus identified with sparse plsda is presented in fig 5 it evidenced that activated carbons were clearly associated to the presence of otus assigned to genera ruminofilibacter mrnl3 and ruminococcus rmnc4 and rmnc5 but also to genera cryptanaerobacter pptc1 and spirochaeta spir3 genera ruminofilibacter and ruminococcus contains rumen species related to the degradation of xylan nissilä et al 2012 while cryptanaerobacter consists of species involved in phenol degradation into benzoate via 4 hydroxybenzoate juteau et al 2005 this figure also highlighted that activated carbon 1 could specifically be related to the presence of an unassigned otu belonging to family petrotogaceae pptg that is known to be involved in phenol degradation na et al 2016 interestingly the most discriminant otus responsible for the positioning of the samples presented in supplementary figure s6 revealed that digesters incubated with zeolites and without support were clearly associated to otus belonging to syntrophic populations such as syntrophomonas synt1 synt4 synt6 and to aminobacterium syne1 and syne2 synergistaceae has already been recovered in hexadecane degrading culture cheng et al 2013 and was described as phenol tolerant in a previous work poirier et al 2016a it also confirmed that otus belonging to lachnospiraceae and particularly to genus mobilitalea lacn3 lacn12 as well as family xi fxi 2 sporanaerobacter and anaerolinaceae anae1 and anae2 were probably associated to these digesters because of their selection by this phenol level as already described by poirier et al 2016a sparse plsda differentiated digesters incubated without support from those incubated with zeolites this distinction was mainly directed by otus affiliated to unassigned genera of families syntrophomonadaceae synt7 spirochaetaceae spir2 and ruminococcaceae rmnc9 to prevotella rknl1 and to proteiniphilum porp12 which were more represented in the presence of zeolites by contrast bioreactors incubated without support were related to many minor otus assigned to genus ruminococcus rmnc20 as well as otus assigned to genera petrimonas porp8 and porp11 their presence seemed to corroborate previous studies in which anaerobic microbiome was operating under extreme inhibitory levels poirier et al 2016a 2016c 2017 due to the high functional redundancy within bacterial populations it remains difficult to assess their respective role during anaerobic digestion without using rna based methods such as metatranscriptomics however statistical analyses allowed the identification of microbial populations which could be correlated either to the degree of inhibition or to specific support additions confirming their specific influence of archaeal and bacterial communities 4 conclusions zeolites and activated carbons additions were both proved to enhance anaerobic digestion in the presence of phenol but towards distinct mechanisms highlighting that inhibition duration mainly drove the microbiota composition in the presence of activated carbons phenol was quickly adsorbed which allowed the emergence of sensitive archaeal and bacterial populations however their distinct surface led to slight differences in phenol sorption times resulting in clearly differentiated ecosystems by contrast zeolites similarly accelerated phenol degradation but with a strong delay compared to activated carbons consequently their microbial dynamics were tightly comparable but strongly close to those recovered in digesters incubated without support nevertheless specific microbial populations could be related to all types of support evidencing their biotic influence on the microbiome these promising results highlighted potentialities to use supports to enhance the process stability of anaerobic digesters subjected to phenol inhibition or digesters treating phenolic substrate

19524,a wide variety of inhibitors can induce anaerobic digester disruption to avoid performance losses support media can be used to mitigate inhibitions however distinguishing the physico chemical from the biological mechanisms of such strategies remains delicate in this framework the impact of 10 g l of different types of zeolites and activated carbons ac on microbial community dynamics during anaerobic digestion of biowaste in the presence of 1 3 g l of phenol was evaluated with 16 s rrna gene sequencing in the presence of ac methanogenesis inhibition was rapidly removed due to a decrease of phenol concentration this abiotic effect related to the physico chemical properties of ac led to increased final ch4 and co2 productions by 29 31 compared to digesters incubated without support interestingly although zeolite did not adsorb phenol final ch4 and co2 production reached comparable levels as with ac nevertheless compared to digesters incubated without support methanogenesis lag phase duration was less reduced in the presence of zeolites 5 1 days than in the presence of activated carbons 12 2 days both types of support induced biotic effects ac and zeolite both allowed the preservation of the major representative archaeal genus of the non inhibited ecosystem methanosarcina by contrast they distinctly shaped bacterial populations otus belonging to class w5 became dominant at the expense of otus assigned to orders clostridiales bacteroidales and anaerolinales in the presence of ac zeolite enhanced the implantation of otus assigned to bacterial phylum cloacimonetes this study highlighted that supports can induce biotic and abiotic effects within digesters inhibited with phenol showing potentialities to enhance anaerobic digestion stability under disrupting conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords methanization inhibition zeolite activated carbon 16s rrna gene sequencing anaerobic digester 1 introduction due to population and economic growth the production of organic waste is increasing worldwide moreover new international regulations push the development of sustainable economically and environmentally attractive technologies that allow a proper valorization of this waste anaerobic digestion ad is a well known option that can efficiently treat organic waste providing value added compounds such as methane holm nielsen et al 2009 moreover ad has lower costs and environmental impacts when compared to other treatment options such as landfilling incineration or composting however this bioprocess still remains vulnerable to a wide variety of inhibitory substances that induce poor operational stability preventing ad wide commercialization chen et al 2008 among ad inhibitors various phenolic compounds are mentioned as the primary cause of digester failure in particular phenol is often recovered in various ad substrates containing humic acids tannins or xenobiotic compounds such as pesticides it is regularly detected at concentrations reaching up to several grams per liter in different types of effluents from petrochemical or paper industry rosenkranz et al 2013 many operational strategies have been developed to limit microbiota disruption by phenol including bioaugmentation with resistant microorganisms microbial acclimation trace element addition dilution and co digestion hajji et al 2000 madigou et al 2016 some support media such as activated carbon are also used in fluidized bed digesters for their physico chemical properties to adsorb phenol lao 2002 recent studies highlighted that support media additions within anaerobic digesters could result in increased biogas production despite the presence of inhibitors by specifically shaping the ecosystem milan et al 2010 mumme et al 2014 among these support media zeolite addition has been mainly used to counteract ammonia inhibition within anaerobic digesters it was proven to specifically enhance the growth of ammonia tolerant methanogens such as methanoculleus montalvo et al 2012 weiss et al 2013 furthermore electrically conductive materials such as biochar or activated carbon are known to promote interspecies electron exchange and to enhance specific electro active microorganisms improving ad performance lee et al 2016 lu et al 2016 consequently support media could be either used for their physico chemical effect or for their biotic effect towards microbial ecosystem nevertheless even if the benefits of such strategies on digestion performance have been investigated the underlying effects of support media towards microorganisms are still poorly known especially under inhibitory conditions therefore besides these technological improvements new research should be carried out not only to compare and optimize these strategies but also to provide a better understanding of the influence of different type of supports on key phylotypes steering the microbial community towards enhanced biodegradation performance a previous study revealed that different types of supports such as zeolites and activated carbon could induce contrasted effects on ad performance under extreme ammonia inhibition without modifying ammonia concentration poirier et al 2017 moreover it highlighted their specific microbiological effect on different archaeal and bacterial groups the present investigation comes in line with this previous work by assessing the effects of the same support media on anaerobic digestion performance and on microbial communities in the presence of another inhibitor the phenol interestingly activated carbon is known to adsorb phenol while zeolites have lower adsorption properties yousef et al 2011 therefore this study aims at comparing the biotic and abiotic effects of the different support media on phenol inhibition mitigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up a total of 30 batch digesters glass plasma bottles of 1 l working volume of 500 ml were seeded with 20 g of centrifuged methanogenic sludge as inoculum sludge was centrifuged in 50 ml tubes at 9000 g during 10 min and supplemented with 50 g of mashed biowaste corresponding to an initial substrate inoculum ratio of 10 g

inoculum was sampled from a 50 l laboratory anaerobic bioreactor incubated at 35 c during 20 days this reactor had been previously inoculated with 20 l of methanogenic sludge collected from a full scale mesophilic digester hrt of 23 days treating wastewater primary and excess biological sludge in a municipal wastewater treatment plant siaap achères france and fed with mashed biowaste in order to acclimatize the microbial consortium to this substrate biochemical methane potential buffer international standard iso 11734 1995 was introduced in all bioreactors to reach a final working volume of 500 ml all incubations were performed in triplicate four support media that were also used in poirier et al 2017 were separately added within batch digesters 2 zeolites and 2 activated carbons support media main characteristics are presented in table 1 zeolite 1 was mainly composed of chabazite 60 while zeolite 2 was mainly composed of clinoptilolite 80 activate carbon 1 was untreated with a surface of 600 800 m2 g while activated carbon 2 600 m2 g was acid washed by the manufacturer control assays without support were also implemented before being added into the digesters at a concentration of 10 g l zeolites and activated carbons were sifted in order to obtain a comparable grain size comprised between 0 5 mm and 1 mm a first set of 15 bioreactors was inhibited with phenol phenol 99 acros organics waltham usa was added to reach a concentration of 1 3 g l corresponding to 25 of the initial cod provided by the inoculum and the biowaste this concentration was selected on the base of a previous work which showed that this inhibition level was sufficient to impair ad performance without completely disrupting methanogenesis poirier et al 2016a a second set of 15 bioreactors was used as a non inhibited control in order to assess the effect of the different support media in absence of phenol bioreactors were subsequently sealed with a screw cap and a rubber septum and headspaces were flushed with n2 purity 99 99 linde gas sa munich germany to ensure anaerobic conditions time zero samples were collected before starting incubation of the reactors at 35 c without agitation in the dark liquid samples 8 ml were periodically collected through the septum and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min the pellets and supernatants thus obtained were stored separately at 20 c for analysis of biomass and chemical indicators respectively digestion tests were run until the daily biogas productions of each reactor decreased below 10 ml 2 2 analytical methods

principal component analyses pca were implemented by using ade4 r package on 16 s rrna tags datasets mixomics package was subsequently used to perform partial least squares discriminant analysis plsda which is a supervised statistical method data was transformed with centered log ratio clr transformation before being statistically analyzed plsda was used to evaluate if the different support media

significant otus that best described the difference between these patterns heatmap of the most discriminant otus in the different samples was built with mixomics package 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of zeolites and activated carbons on anaerobic digestion performance 3 1 1 phenol concentration dynamics phenol concentration dynamics are presented in fig 1 throughout the experiment phenol concentration decreased down less than 0 01 g l in all the bioreactors without support phenol concentration dropped from 1 3 to 0 1 g l between day 39 and day 60 it confirmed that this inoculum was able to resist and to completely degrade this phenol concentration even without any support addition poirier et al 2016a interestingly times after which phenol concentration started to decrease were strongly influenced by the type of support present in the digester after 3 days of incubation phenol concentration dropped in all digesters supplemented with activated carbons these support media are widely used for their adsorption properties dąbrowski et al 2005 therefore it can be assumed that phenol was quickly adsorbed on activated carbons surface interestingly activated carbon 1 seemed to better adsorb phenol than activated carbon 2 indeed after 7 days of incubation phenol decrease was circa 2 fold higher in the presence of activated carbon 1 this could be related to the higher surface of activated carbon 1 600 800 m2 g compared to activated carbon 2 600 m2 g however after 16 days phenol was not detected anymore in all incubations with activated carbons it was thus hypothesized that it was completely adsorbed on these support media phenol concentration remained stable circa its initial level 1 3 g l up to 39 days of incubation in both triplicates of digesters incubated with zeolites 1 and 2 this result evidenced that phenol was not adsorbed on zeolites nevertheless compared to the control phenol degradation was enhanced by the presence of zeolites after 50 days 83 and 71 of the initial phenol concentration was respectively degraded in the presence of zeolites 1 and 2 while at the same date only 26 were degraded in the control digesters incubated without support therefore it can be assumed that zeolites accelerated phenol degradation confirming the beneficial effect of zeolites on ad in the presence of 1 3 g l of phenol 3 1 2 biogas production kinetics average cumulated ch4 and co2 productions of each triplicate of reactors are presented in fig 2 those obtained with digesters incubated without phenol are detailed in supplementary fig s1 three kinetic parameters ultimate production maximum production rate and lag time calculated by fitting cumulative production curves with gompertz equation for both gases are shown in supplementary table s1 in the control experiment without phenol regardless of supports addition ch4 and co2 production kinetics remained relatively similar indicating that supports did not seem to significantly affect biogas production performance under non inhibiting conditions figure s1 in the presence of phenol without support ultimate co2 and ch4 production 1880 27 ml and 3200 86 ml respectively reached comparable levels as under non inhibiting conditions 1713 45 ml and 3134 78 ml respectively however ch4 lag phase duration increased by 12 days while co2 and ch4 maximum production rates were reduced by 43 and 45 respectively consequently it takes respectively circa 47 and 12 supplementary days to produce the same amount of ch4 and co2 as under non inhibitory conditions on the contrary all the incubations with supports and phenol equally led to higher ultimate co2 and ch4 production than control digesters incubated without phenol it can be explained by the degradation of phenol into biogas as already described chapleur et al 2016 however this was not observed in incubations with phenol but without support media this could be due to the fact that without support phenol was degraded in other potentially inhibiting metabolites such as benzoate and benzoyl coa that were not quantified but not completely metabolized into biogas during the course of the experiment hoyos hernandez et al 2014 schink et al 2000 at this concentration level this was already observed by chapleur et al 2016 it suggests that either support media had a beneficial effect on phenol degradation into biogas or that activated carbons and zeolites adsorbed accumulated metabolites produced during phenol degradation suppressing thus their inhibitory effect however to our knowledge no study reported yet the sorption of phenol degradation metabolites by zeolites or activated carbon interestingly ch4 and co2 maximum production rates were specifically influenced by the type of support added in the digesters both zeolites equally mitigated phenol inhibition and enhanced substrate degradation to biogas compared to digesters without support ch4 lag phase duration was reduced by 5 days while ch4 and co2 ultimate yields both increased by circa 22 and 29 respectively probably because of complete phenol degradation through biogas since this support did not have any physicochemical effect on phenol adsorption in the digesters it suggests that zeolites may also have beneficial effects on anaerobic digestion microbial community weiss et al 2013 hypothesized that this support has a biotic impact by providing suitable mineral micro habitats for biomass immobilization other authors suggested that zeolites could release beneficial trace elements montalvo et al 2012 however regarding supplementary figure s1 these biotic effects seem to be only detectable in our case while the microbiota is inhibited since without inhibitor no significant improvement was observed in biogas production performance activated carbons better alleviated phenol inhibition than zeolites compared to digesters without support in the presence of these supports ch4 and co2 maximum production rates as well as ch4 lag phase were comparable to those observed under non inhibiting conditions furthermore both support media led to a similar increase of 23 26 and 29 31 of maximum ch4 and co2 ultimate yields respectively corresponding to the already mentioned phenol degradation into biogas accordingly to phenol dynamics contrasted results were noticed between both supports particularly ch4 production started 3 days earlier in the presence of activated carbon 1 than with activated carbon 2 moreover maximum ch4 and co2 production rates were also circa 10 higher with activated carbon 1 consequently biogas production kinetics were significantly faster with this support than with activated carbon 2 suggesting that both activated carbons distinct characteristics could play a role in their influence on ad microbiome it confirmed that activated carbon 1 better adsorbed phenol than activated carbon 2 which could lead to the delayed biogas production kinetics observed with this support 3 1 3 vfa concentration dynamics acetate propionate and butyrate were detected in all the incubations vfa concentration dynamics are presented in supplementary material fig s2 contrary to non inhibiting conditions not shown supports had a significant effect on vfa dynamics in the presence of phenol without support phenol led to higher levels of acetate and butyrate than in the presence of different support media the absence of support also induced longer degradation phases for all vfas including propionate these results suggested that phenol mainly inhibited vfa degraders while producers did not seem to be impaired at this concentration vfa concentration kinetics also confirmed previous observation made on ch4 production kinetics support media all mitigated vfa degradation inhibition but with various efficiencies activated carbons led to better vfas degradation than zeolites furthermore activated carbon 1 even led to vfa degradation dynamics comparable to those observed under non inhibiting conditions in our previous work poirier et al 2016a phenol also impaired acetate and propionate maximum concentrations while butyrate production was not significantly inhibited delays in acetate and propionate degradation in the presence of 1 3 g l of phenol had been attributed to the inhibition of vfa degraders such as acetotrophic archaeal ch4 producers which were initially present in the inoculum in this work acetate and propionate degradation seemed to occur concomitantly with phenol degradation for all support media it can thus be hypothesized that these vfa degraders were inhibited by phenol once phenol level decreased they became active again and allowed vfa degradation and biogas production this result has already been described by many authors chapleur et al 2016 wirth et al 2015 3 2 effect of zeolites and activated carbons on microbial communities exposed to phenol inhibition microbial community dynamics patterns were investigated with 16 s rrna gene high throughput sequencing the objective was to assess the potential influence of each support on microbial community composition and identify key microorganisms involved in structural modifications of the microbiota a total of 23 samples were selected depending on biogas production kinetics advancement 17 in the presence of 1 3 g l of phenol and 5 under non inhibiting conditions one sample was used to characterize the initial microbial composition of the digesters several thousands of sequences were identified for each sample they were assembled into 527 and 12 otus for bacteria and archaea respectively due to the large number of bacterial otus relative abundances were aggregated at the family level for stacked bar plot representation otus belonging to the same archaeal genus or to the same bacterial order were represented with the same color palette archaeal and bacterial composition of digesters incubated under non inhibiting conditions after 16 days of incubation when ch4 production rate was maximal are presented in stacked bar plots in supplementary figure s3 3 2 1 archaeal and bacterial dynamics throughout the incubation 3 2 1 1 archaea archaeal community composition dynamics were represented in stacked bar plots at the otu level in fig 3 samples were aggregated by support initially added and by sampling date methanogenic archaea detected in the inoculum mainly belonged to otus assigned to genus methanolinea ml1 and genus methanosarcina msc1 with respective relative abundances of 28 and 52 remaining minor otus were assigned to genus methanoculleus 6 and genus methanobacterium 3 without support phenol greatly inhibited the otu affiliated to genus methanosarcina msc1 its abundance decreased down to 11 after 7 days of incubation data not shown while genus methanolinea remained predominant within the microbiota 55 throughout the incubation methanosarcina otu1 msc1 gained importance within the microbiota after 31 days while ch4 production started methanosarcina otu1 msc1 was predominant with a relative abundance of 84 this percentage remained stable during the most active ch4 production phase from day 31 up to day 50 indicating that the microbiota evolved toward a stable and efficient composition dominated by this single otu which managed to overcome the inhibition archaeal composition of the digesters incubated with support media indicated that the delay caused by phenol in ch4 production kinetics seemed to be highly correlated with the emergence of methanosarcina otu1 msc1 genus methanosarcina has been reported as a sign of process stability by many studies de vrieze et al 2012 lins et al 2014 moset et al 2015 its predominance within all the digesters incubated with 1 3 g l of phenol suggested that this genus was able after a certain period depending on the inhibitor concentration and the type of support added in the digester to overcome this stress conditions and produce ch4 moreover its growth seems to be correlated with the decrease of acetate concentration in the bioreactors since this archaeal genus is known to use acetate to produce ch4 it can be hypothesized that methanosarcina emerged at the expense of other genera thanks to its ability to consume acetate in the presence of zeolites genus methanosarcina otu1 msc1 was less inhibited than without support after 7 days its relative abundance only dropped to 30 moreover after 23 days of incubation it already re increased up to 70 varying between 70 and 82 for both zeolites throughout the experiment hence zeolites did not affect the final composition of the archaeal community but they seemed to accelerate its evolution by preserving methanosarcina otu1 msc1 from phenol inhibition it can also be hypothesized that zeolite pores were preferentially colonized by methanosarcina thanks to the presence of trace elements suitable for its growth it was already reported by different studies milán et al 2010 showed that magnesium zeolite stimulated the presence of methanosarcina within batch digesters treating winery wastewater weiss et al 2011 demonstrated that activated zeolites i e clinoptilolites were mainly colonized by methanosarcina barkeri and methanoculleus bourgensis during anaerobic digestion of grass silage weiss et al 2011 moreover methanosarcinaceae also colonized zeolite fixed bed digester treating chicken waste ziganshina et al 2015 in the presence of activated carbons methanosarcina was not inhibited by phenol since after only 16 days its relative abundance was circa 70 77 this was probably due to the sorption of phenol on the surface of these support media that limited its presence in the liquid phase which let methanosarcina otu1 msc1 grow 3 2 1 2 bacteria bacterial relative abundances were represented at the family level in stacked bar plots in fig 4 most of the bacterial otus recovered in the initial mix consisting in inoculum and biowaste belonged to family lactobacillaceae lact 53 to an unassigned family belonging to w5 class uw5 9 to anaerolinaceae anae 8 and to families from orders clostridiales 10 and bacteroidales 8 lactobacillaceae were not detectable throughout the experiment by contrast orders bacteroidales and clostridiales both emerged to become predominant in the microbiota their global relative abundances reached circa 41 61 in all digesters during the incubation however the composition of these orders greatly varied regarding the type of support added in the bioreactor order bacteroidales mainly consisted in family porphyromonadaceae porp this family was suggested to play an important role in the degradation of the accumulated volatile fatty acids regueiro et al 2014 without support its relative abundance reached 28 before slightly decreasing down to 21 at day 50 interestingly in thepresence of supports its proportion dropped down to 11 14 by day 39 indicated its potential relation with the degree of inhibition of the microbiota moreover diversity within order bacteroidales seemed to be more important in the presence of activated carbons this was mainly attributed to the specific emergence of family marinilabiaceae mrnl which increased up to 6 9 suggesting that this family could better grow if phenol concentration decreased rapidly in the digester by contrast in the presence of activated carbons the proportion of otus assigned to order clostridiales was reduced members of this order have been recognized to hydrolyze a variety of polysaccharides by different mechanisms due to their capacity to process a wide range of substrates their importance has been stood out by many authors ali shah et al 2014 carballa et al 2015 total abundance of this order remained between 17 and 25 throughout the experiment in the presence of activated carbons while it varied from 25 to 35 without support and with zeolites this difference was mostly attributed to the subsequent emergence of family lachnospiraceae lacn and syntrophomonadaceae synt lachnospiraceae were mostly recovered in the earliest days suggesting their involvement in the early steps of biowaste degradation while they were progressively replaced by syntrophomonadaceae their respective relative abundances reached 13 18 and 17 19 in incubations without support and with zeolites while it remained below 5 in the presence of activated carbons syntrophomonadaceae family has already been associated with efficient acetogenic performance notably because they are known to degrade butyrate to acetate carballa et al 2015 hence it could be hypothesized that these families played a key role in ad process ranging from hydrolysis to acetogenesis syntrophomonadaceae could also be involved in phenol degradation poirier et al 2016b in the presence of activated carbons phenol concentration quickly decreased and probably shaped different interactions within the microbiota involving less otus belonging to order clostridiales interestingly both activated carbons promoted the emergence of otus assigned to family spirochaetaceae spir relative abundance of this family remained below 2 in all other digesters while it reached 6 for both activated carbons a recent study evidenced that spirochaetales were clearly involved in sao with hydrogenotrophic methanogens lee et al 2015 it suggested that sao could be maintained in absence of activated carbons due to a possible functional redundancy between syntrophomonadaceae and spirochaetaceae furthermore the proportion of otus assigned to anaerolinaceae seemed to be correlated with the degree of inhibition of the digesters without support the proportion of this family increased from 11 to 27 while with zeolites it increased from 10 13 to 17 18 and only to 5 9 with activated carbons nevertheless members of this family have not been correlated to different process parameters yet all these observations tended to indicate that the duration of the inhibition strongly influenced bacterial community activated carbons induced a quick decrease of the stress level that led to bacterial shifts and probably to the implementation of new syntrophic interactions with archaea and particularly with methanosarcina which dominated the archaeal community by contrast zeolites did not have a significant influence on bacterial populations except on family anaerolinaceae by reducing its emergence 3 2 2 statistical analyses revealed specific populations associated with support media principal component analysis pca and sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis sparse plsda were performed to statistically analyze archaea and bacteria 16 s rrna gene tags in order to identify specific populations associated with the different support media for the sake of clarity t0 sample which was collected to characterize the initial mix as well as t2 sample day 7 which was too different from the rest of the samples were not included in this analysis in order to evidence potential patterns in sparse plsda representation samples were clustered by type of support media initially added zeolites and activated carbons key phylotypes phylogenetic assignation was abbreviated for these representations 3 2 2 1 archaea in order to support observations made on the stacked bar plot representation pca was performed with these data and is presented in supplementary figure s4 this unsupervised statistical analysis confirmed that archaeal community was governed by three major otus assigned to methanosarcina msc1 methanoculleus mc1 and methanolinea ml1 samples collected in the earliest days of incubation were predominated by methanolinea ml1 and methanoculleus mc1 which were present in the inoculum but not considered as active during the incubation while throughout the experiment all final archaeal compositions were dominated by methanosarcina msc1 which seems to be the only ch4 producer since dominant archaeal populations were relatively similar in the different digesters pca did not highlight any clear specific influence of support addition moreover due to the very low number of sequences assigned to minor archaeal otus 50 in the total dataset complementary supervised statistical method sparse plsda aiming at identifying any potential effect of support on sub dominant populations was not performed on the same dataset rna based methods such as metatranscriptomics could be more appropriate to assess the activity of sub dominant methanogenic populations within the microbiota 3 2 2 2 bacteria pca was also performed on 16 s bacterial abundance table and presented in supplementary figure s5 for this unsupervised statistical analysis otus were aggregated at the family level samples distribution revealed that activated carbons played a key role in shaping bacterial populations it confirmed that bacterial dynamics within digesters incubated with these support media were tightly related to the presence of otus assigned to families marinilabiaceae mrnl spirochaetaceae spir and to an unassigned family belonging to order w5 uw5 and to peptococcaceae pptc by contrast zeolites addition did not seem to significantly influence bacterial composition compared to the digester without support similarly to observations made on the stacked bar plots the correlation circle tended to link these latter digesters with families affiliated to lachnospiraceae lacn syntrophomonadaceae synt and anaerolinaceae anae in order to confirm these first observations and to identify key otus responsible for this distribution sparse plsda was performed without aggregating the dataset at the family level heatmap of the most discriminant otus identified with sparse plsda is presented in fig 5 it evidenced that activated carbons were clearly associated to the presence of otus assigned to genera ruminofilibacter mrnl3 and ruminococcus rmnc4 and rmnc5 but also to genera cryptanaerobacter pptc1 and spirochaeta spir3 genera ruminofilibacter and ruminococcus contains rumen species related to the degradation of xylan nissilä et al 2012 while cryptanaerobacter consists of species involved in phenol degradation into benzoate via 4 hydroxybenzoate juteau et al 2005 this figure also highlighted that activated carbon 1 could specifically be related to the presence of an unassigned otu belonging to family petrotogaceae pptg that is known to be involved in phenol degradation na et al 2016 interestingly the most discriminant otus responsible for the positioning of the samples presented in supplementary figure s6 revealed that digesters incubated with zeolites and without support were clearly associated to otus belonging to syntrophic populations such as syntrophomonas synt1 synt4 synt6 and to aminobacterium syne1 and syne2 synergistaceae has already been recovered in hexadecane degrading culture cheng et al 2013 and was described as phenol tolerant in a previous work poirier et al 2016a it also confirmed that otus belonging to lachnospiraceae and particularly to genus mobilitalea lacn3 lacn12 as well as family xi fxi 2 sporanaerobacter and anaerolinaceae anae1 and anae2 were probably associated to these digesters because of their selection by this phenol level as already described by poirier et al 2016a sparse plsda differentiated digesters incubated without support from those incubated with zeolites this distinction was mainly directed by otus affiliated to unassigned genera of families syntrophomonadaceae synt7 spirochaetaceae spir2 and ruminococcaceae rmnc9 to prevotella rknl1 and to proteiniphilum porp12 which were more represented in the presence of zeolites by contrast bioreactors incubated without support were related to many minor otus assigned to genus ruminococcus rmnc20 as well as otus assigned to genera petrimonas porp8 and porp11 their presence seemed to corroborate previous studies in which anaerobic microbiome was operating under extreme inhibitory levels poirier et al 2016a 2016c 2017 due to the high functional redundancy within bacterial populations it remains difficult to assess their respective role during anaerobic digestion without using rna based methods such as metatranscriptomics however statistical analyses allowed the identification of microbial populations which could be correlated either to the degree of inhibition or to specific support additions confirming their specific influence of archaeal and bacterial communities 4 conclusions zeolites and activated carbons additions were both proved to enhance anaerobic digestion in the presence of phenol but towards distinct mechanisms highlighting that inhibition duration mainly drove the microbiota composition in the presence of activated carbons phenol was quickly adsorbed which allowed the emergence of sensitive archaeal and bacterial populations however their distinct surface led to slight differences in phenol sorption times resulting in clearly differentiated ecosystems by contrast zeolites similarly accelerated phenol degradation but with a strong delay compared to activated carbons consequently their microbial dynamics were tightly comparable but strongly close to those recovered in digesters incubated without support nevertheless specific microbial populations could be related to all types of support evidencing their biotic influence on the microbiome these promising results highlighted potentialities to use supports to enhance the process stability of anaerobic digesters subjected to phenol inhibition or digesters treating phenolic substrate
