evapotranspiration crop growth yields and water use efficiency wue various crop growth stages a two year summer maize growth experiment was conducted in containers under a rain shelter to analyze the effects of plastic film gravel sand and straw surface mulches on soil water dynamics and crop growth processes a lysimeter was designed for each container to dynamically measure soil plant water

st100 yield and wue increases in the st100 and sand treatments were small this research revealed that plastic mulch had the largest yield and wue increase of which black plastic film was better than transparent plastic film the yield and wue increase of gravel sand mulching was larger than 100 mm in length straw mulching but less than 1 mm in length straw mulching keywords mulching technology evapotranspiration yield water use efficiency summer maize 1 introduction the key factor restricting the efficient utilization of cultivable land and agricultural production is water resources scarcity in arid and semi arid areas while increasing agricultural production it is a great challenge to minimize its ecological and environmental impacts mulching technology has been widely applied in north china as water saving practice mulching materials such as plastic film gravel or sand and straw were applied to different field crops and plants and these mulching technologies have significantly improved soil physicochemical properties soil moisture crop productivity and water use efficiency wue ji and unger 2001a muñoz et al 2017 wang et al 2009 the benefits of surface plastic

shown to reduce soil erosion decreased evaporation and favorably reduced soil temperature fluctuation between day and night fox et al 2000 kemper et al 1994 li 2003 wang et al 2014 yamanaka et al 2004 further straw mulching has been shown to improve soil water and crop relations by improving physicochemical properties of soil such as bulk density porosity and aggregate stability jordán et al 2010 silva and cook 2003 there have been various investigations comparing mulching effects on soil water storage total actual evapotranspiration et c t summer maize crop growth yield wue and precipitation use efficiency different cultivation and mulching periods and irrigation levels under plastic film and straw mulches have been considered wang et al 2011 2015 wu et al 2017 yan et al 2017 also for both straw and gravel sand mulches different application amounts were considered cai et al 2015 jordán et al 2010 mulching technologies were applied to seed maize spring maize summer maize and other grain or fruit crops fan et al 2016 luo et al 2015 yan et al 2017 wang et al 2014 zhao et al 2016 in most conditions the soil water storage crop growth yield and wue or precipitation use efficiency for different mulches increased to different extents correspondingly the cumulative soil water evaporation or et c t decreased and results were similar for investigations that incorporated two mulching technologies of plastic film mulch gravel sand mulch and straw mulch plastic film mulch has been shown to reduce soil water evaporation and facilitate the movement of water moved from deeper soil layers to the topsoil by vapor transport and capillarity wang et al 2015 resulting in higher topsoil water storage than the bare soil higher soil water storage promoted crop growth as indicated by greater plant height biomass accumulation lai grain yield and wue fan et al 2016 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 the effectiveness of evaporation reduction associated with gravel sand mulch was positively correlated with the thickness of covering and was inversely related to particle size diaz et al 2005 xie et al 2006 yang et al 2014 further field trials with gravel sand mulch show this practice could effectively ameliorate soil conditions promote plant growth crop yield and wue bu et al 2013 sun et al 2012 the field gravel mulching conducted on the loess plateau of china significantly increased the total biomass by 11 41 and grain yield by 17 70 respectively bu et al 2013 soil water storage within the 200cm depth kept increasing when straw was applied on the soil surface cai et al 2015 straw mulch was found to have conserved 106 9mm water in the 0 200cm soil depths during maize growth period which accounted for 35 of all water sources li et al 2013a b soil water storage increased with the increase in mulching rates ji and unger 2001b unger 1978 straw mulch improved the hydrothermal conditions of the soil by reducing the range of temperature and evaporation losses consequently promoted plant height and leaf area yield formation sekhon et al 2005 and wue li et al 2013a b sidhu et al 2007 yan et al 2017 the various straw mulch rates on water conservation and yield increase were effective and straw rate of 9000kg ha was preferable for the loess plateau of china cai et al 2015 the effects of various mulching materials on actual evapotranspiration et c crop growth yields and wue have been widely studied however most previous research has focused on mulching with one or two materials or combined mulching technology with the other field management practices such as ridge furrow irrigation wang et al 2016 yan et al 2017 few studies have directly evaluated the effects of multiple mulching materials on soil water storage et c yields and wue furthermore the increases of soil water storage crop growth yield and wue under mulching conditions were uncertain and a direct assessment of mulching efficiency for plastic film mulching gravel sand and straw mulching were difficult to obtain in previous research because the field soils conditions the crop species the climatic background and management strategies were diverse this research aims to assess the effects of seven single or combined mulching technologies on soil water storage et c growth processes yields and wue of summer maize using the self designed meso scale lysimeter observation equipment to reveal the mechanism of different mulching technologies on decrease et c and promoting yields and to quantify the response of increasing wue to various mulching technologies and determine the optimum mulching application in the studied area 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study site and the experimental equipment summer maize growth experiments over two growing seasons under different mulching conditions under a rain shelter were conducted in yangling china with a longitude of 108 24 e latitude of 34 20 n and an average altitude of 521m above sea level the multiyear average frost free days are 221 mean annual temperature is 12 9 c 2196h average sunshine and 660mm annual precipitation respectively the region is characterized as a warm and wet monsoon semi humid climate zone meso scale lysimeters with a basal diameter of 38cm a height of 65cm with 1 cm thick plexiglass walls were place on load cells modern haofang instrument co ltd shenzhen china 150kg capacity 0 02 accuracy for monitoring total lysimeter weight for evapotranspiration et estimates and were held in place by a stainless steel supports the bottom of each lysimeter contained uniformly distributed holes 5mm diameter and was lined with filter paper other equipment used included a three sided rain shelter height of 3 0m a width of 6 0m and a length of 7 1m and was open at the south side an automatic data collection system and a solar panel which was connected to all of the 24 lysimeters fig 1 each lysimeter demonstrated similar reliability in measuring daily actual evapotranspiration et c d to daamen et al 1993 who showed that the method was simple and accurate a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa was used to provide excitation voltage and record output data from each load cell at a frequency of 1h the 24 lysimeters were positioned randomly under the rain shelter in order to keep the same surroundings as the field for the summer maize the surface of the lysimeters were placed flush with the ground 2 2 mulching treatments soil properties and packing a total of 8 treatments were designed including no mulching and 7 different surface mulching treatments table 1 the eight treatments with three replications i e 24 meso scale lysimeters were distributed randomly the surface mulched materials were gravel sand chopped straw at lengths of 1 and 100mm transparent and black plastic films and plastic films overlying chopped straws for convenience the treatments names were simplified table 1 the mulching materials were applied on soil surface the plastic film was purchased from gansu fuyu plastic industry co ltd http www fy6521680 cn the sand gravels were collected from the wei river bank in yangling china and sieved with an 8 mm in diameter screen the summer maize growth experiments lasted from june 27 to october 17 in 2015 and from june 19 to october 7 in 2016 covering the complete growth stages from sowing to harvesting the soil used in the experiments was classified as lou series collected from the top 30cm of crop field in north yangling shaanxi china the lou soils were air dried crushed and sieved to pass an 8 mm screen to remove roots stones and debris the particle size distribution was measured using a longbench mastersizer 2000 type laser diffractometry malvern instruments england the soil was 11 clay 29 silt and 60 sand and had a sandy loam texture according to the usda texture classification system the weather dried θ r and saturated water contents θ s were measured gravimetrically using the oven dry method with values of 0 08 and 0 48cm3cm 3 the field capacity θf was 0 39cm3cm 3 and analyzed using the wilcox method salter and williams 1965 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured by the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 with a value of 0 02 cmmin 1 the wilting coefficient was measured by high speed refrigerated centrifuge hitachi himac cr21g ii with a value of 0 13cm3 cm 3 the lou soils with initial water content of θ r were packed into each container to a depth of 55cm to achieve a bulk density of 1 44gcm 3 the fertilizers with an n p2o5 k2o ratio of 1 0 5 0 8 were mixed with the lou soils and applied at the depth of 5 10cm 2 3 irrigation soil sampling and plant growth experiments after allowing the containers to settle for 24h 200mm of water equivalent of field capacity water storage was applied to the surface of the lysimeters after water application all the containers were covered by plastic films to avoid uneven evaporation from soil surface twenty four hours after the first irrigation the plastic film was removed from the containers 4 summer maize seeds whose variety was qinlong 12 were sown and two plants were kept when the seeds germinated and grew to 5cm height for each soil container during the summer maize growth stages when average soil water content θ ave of the bpf1 treatment as measured by the lysimeters reached 70 of θf i e when the soils in a most water conserved treatment became dry 60mm irrigation amount was applied to all of the 8 treatments irrigation time was set between 18 00 and 20 00 to reduce evaporation of irrigation water for all of the 8 treatments total irrigation applied was 470mm in 2015 and 530mm in 2016 respectively after every two irrigation events soil samples were taken with a 2 cm diameter steel auger below the mulching layers at a 5 cm interval along the vertical profile the holes were backfilled with equal mass and water content of soil immediately after the sampling the samples were weighed oven dried and re weighed to measure θ the soil water storage was calculated over the 55cm depth and changes in storage were reconciled with the lysimeter data the stem diameter of summer maize was measured using a vernier caliper the height and leaf area of summer maize were measured once with a tape every 10days leaf area was the product of leaf length the largest width and 0 75 correction factor according to mckee 1964 the lai was the averaged leaf area for two summer maize plants dividing the cross area of horizontal plane in soil container 1134cm2 at maturity each summer maize plant was harvested manually the panicle length and diameter were measured with a vernier caliper total grain weight was measured after the grains were oven dried at 105 c for 30min and dried at 75 c to constant weight in an oven the average values of six crops were used for comparison of yield related variables under different mulches et c t total actual evapotranspiration mm was estimated with et c d daily actual evapotranspiration mm within the summer maize growth stages et c d was calculated by the measured values by lysimeter 1 e t c d 10 σ w i 1 j w i j n q where w is weight of soil container g wij and w i 1 j are w of ith and i 1 th days at jth hour and j 0 1 2 23 n 24 q is surface area of soil container cm2 wue was calculated as the summer maize yield divided by et c t zhou et al 2011 the relative errors of the measured et c d by lysimeter varied from 1 to 9 the et c t soil water storage and yield related indices of all eight treatments were analyzed to test statistical difference with an anova using the spss 17 0 at a significant level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of soil water storage and evapotranspiration under different mulches there were climatic differences between the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons during all growth stages of summer maize the daily temperature generally ranged from 17 5 to 28 2 c and 20 7 29 7 c in 2015 and 2016 respectively the average daily air temperature was 22 9 c in 2015 and 25 2 c in 2016 respectively the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated by et 0 calculator liu 2016 the mean et 0 values over the growing season were 5 51 and 5 82 mmd 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the average pan evaporation values within the same period were 3 92 mmd 1 in 2015 and 4 49 mmd 1 in 2016 respectively the average et c values of ck were 3 73 mmd 1 in 2015 and 4 65 mmd 1 in 2016 respectively higher temperature et 0 and pan evaporation in 2016 resulted in higher et c for the maize growth period the temporal variations of et c d daily actual evapotranspiration mm in fig 2 reflect the meteorological conditions for both growing seasons for all of the 8 treatments et c d increased to a peak after each irrigation then decreased rapidly in fig 2 a for 2015 et c d in the ck treatment was obviously larger during the first 20days after sowing but was much smaller in the subsequent 14days than the other mulching treatments later variations of et c d basically had similar pattern for different treatments but the peak values changed for different treatments because et c d was not only affected by the atmospheric evaporative demand and irrigation amount but also depended on soil water storage larger et c d at the earlier crop growth stages would result in smaller et c d in the later growth stages since the total irrigation amounts were same for different treatments in the same year similar variation patterns of et c d for different mulching treatments were found for 2016 fig 2 b especially after 50days of sowing the et c d values of the mulched treatments were obviously smaller than the ck treatment within 22days after sowing which showed the soil water evaporation inhibition effects of different mulches the curves for cumulative evapotranspiration et c cum also displayed larger evapotranspiration values of the ck treatment in the jointing stage but differed slightly from about 40days after sowing till harvesting fig 3 this showed that the evaporation inhibition effects of mulches were mainly in the stages when crops were still small and soil water evaporation contributed more than transpiration to et c li et al 2013b confirmed that during rapid growth periods transpiration accounts for a large proportion of et in maize li et al 2013a reported that the different plastic film mulches plastic film biodegradable and liquid film and straw mulching treatments reduced et within 60 days after sowing of spring maize increased et by 4 6 17 0mm 60 90 days after sowing but had almost similar et during 90 120 days after sowing when crop leaves began to senesce crop transpiration and canopy cover reduced soil water evaporation dominated et our results agreed well with other research in indicating lower et c d and et c cum for 7 mulching treatments than ck at early growth stage fan et al 2016 li et al 2013a relative to the ck treatment et c t total actual evapotranspiration of the mulching treatments differed significantly except st100 there were general decrease of et c t for the two experimental years for different mulching treatments but the values were all small table 2 there was smaller decrease rate of et c t both in 2015 6 and 2016 4 this didn t mean mulches on surface affected soil water storages small but meant et c t differed small for both mulch and no mulching treatments the main differences in et c d were in the jointing stage table 3 the stored additional water in the soils by the mulches than bare soils in the early crop growth stages was used for plant transpiration and growth in later crop stages compared with the ck treatment the soil water storage of 7 different mulching treatments increased 0 5 19 9mm in 2015 and 7 7 21 3mm in 2016 the lower et c d of different mulching treatments resulted in larger soil water storage both in the jointing stages of 2015 and 2016 with a treatment rank of ck st100 sand st1 trpf0 trpf1 bpf0 bpf1 fig 4 average soil water storage over the two growing seasons at the tasseling stage did not differ significantly among the ck and the different mulching treatments soil water storage during the filling and maturity stages slightly increased from ck to st100 sand trpf0 trpf1 bpf0 st1 and bpf1 total soil water storage increased most in the bpf1 treatment but the least in st100 indicating black plastic film over 1mm wheat straw had the most beneficial effects on soil water storage and the 100mm wheat straw mulch showed the least improvement in soil water storage some other research indicated that when compared with ck soil water storage increased 6 52mm for plastic film mulching treatment 15 44mm for gravel sand mulching treatment and 20 29mm for straw mulching treatment bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 our results were generally consistent with theirs the soil water storage of st1 was larger than the three plastic film mulching treatments the reason may be that when straw was chopped to 1mm in length the porosity of the mulching layer was greatly reduced and the evaporation was also reduced the distribution of volumetric soil water content θ v before each irrigation in different growth stages of summer maize for 2015 and 2016 is presented in fig 5 the θ v distribution in vertical profiles were more similar during filling and mature stages than during jointing and tasseling stages between 2015 and 2016 for both 2015 and 2016 in the jointing tasseling filling and mature stages θ v variations in vertical profiles agreed well with that of soil water storage in 2015 for the jointing tasseling filling and mature stages fig 5 a d larger θ v values were observed for the 4 plastic mulching treatments compared with ck θ v of the 1 mm straw mulch treatment was the largest at the depths 25 40cm among the 8 treatments followed by θ v of the sand gravel mulch and 100 mm straw mulch treatments θ v values in profiles were much smaller after the jointing stage there was general similarly distribution of θ v in different growth stages of 2016 except that 1 there was even smaller differences between the 8 treatments in the tasseling stage fig 5f this was because there was higher temperature in the summer of 2016 which accelerated the evapotranspiration of summer maize the stored water in soils were taken full advantage by the summer maize and θ v decreased to as low as the wilting coefficient 0 13cm3 cm 3 for all the 8 different mulching technologies however the effects of different mulching treatments were still obvious because the available water that summer maize utilized was different which can be shown from the growth parameters see section 3 3 2 θ v of the 1 mm straw mulch treatment was smaller than the 4 plastic mulching treatments 3 2 dynamics of summer maize growth the increased soil water storage early in the growing season under the mulching treatments was effectively used for the later growth of summer maize generally smaller final stem diameter plant height and lai were observed in 2015 than 2016 for all of the treatments because of the climatic environmental differences fig 6 in both 2015 and 2016 stem diameter plant height and lai of the 7 mulching treatments were obviously higher than the ck treatment the final stem diameter had a general treatment rank of bpf1 trpf1 st1 bpf0 sand st100 trpf0 ck the two year average maximal plant height was higher under plastic film mulching treatment than gravel sand and straw mulching treatments maximal lai was higher under straw mulch treatment than under plastic film and gravel sand mulch treatments lai of the 7 mulching treatments abruptly increased compared with the ck within 60days after sowing then rapidly decreased compared with the ck at later growth stages which was similar to previous studies fan et al 2016 wang et al 2011 xu et al 2015 li et al 2013a b indicated that lai ranked in plastic film mulch treatment straw mulch treatment gravel sand mulch treatment which was different from our results 3 3 yield related indices of summer maize under different mulching conditions the yield related variables of summer maize in 2015 and 2016 for different mulching treatments are given in table 4 as indicated the differences between the maximum and the minimum spike lengths in the 8 treatments were 1 9cm and between the maximum and the minimum diameters were 7 2mm in 2015 respectively but were 2 3cm and 11 8mm in 2016 respectively weight of 100 kernels and yields varied as mulches changed in general differences in spike length and the other growth variables between various mulching treatments were insignificant especially in 2015 for the yield and wue there were significant differences between ck and various plastic film mulches i e bpf1 trpf0 trpf1 and bpf0 in either 2015 or 2016 yield rankings for mulching treatments were bpf0 trpf1 trpf0 bpf1 st1 st100 sand ck in 2015 but bpf0 bpf1 trpf1 sand trpf0 st1 st100 ck in 2016 wue rankings were bpf0 bpf1 trpf1 trpf0 st1 st100 sand ck in 2015 and bpf0 bpf1 trpf1 trpf0 sand st1 st100 ck in 2016 averaged over both growing seasons yield increased by 34 29 29 28 23 18 and 13 for bpf0 trpf1 bpf1 trpf0 st1 sand and st100 compared with the ck respectively averaged over both growing seasons the wue increased 4 1 3 6 3 5 3 2 3 0 2 1 and 1 35kghm 2 mm 1 for bpf0 bpf1 trpf1 trpf0 st1 sand and st100 than ck respectively in general the yield and wue followed a consistent order of mulching treatments indicating generally better efficiency of plastic film mulching than gravel sand and straw mulching technologies the black plastic film treatment had the largest yields and wue among the four plastic film mulching treatments while the transparent plastic film plus chopped 1 mm in length straw had the lowest yields and wue overall the increase of maize yield from our research fell into the range of 24 37 for plastic film mulch treatment of 5 32 for gravel sand mulch treatment and of 9 29 for straw mulch treatment respectively the increase of wue ranged from 29 40 for plastic film mulch treatment of 9 34 for the gravel sand mulch treatment and of 10 33 for the straw mulch treatment respectively higher yield and wue were obtained under the 7 mulching treatments than compared with the ck in the two experimental years some related studies have demonstrated that the plastic film mulch treatment increased maize yield by 44 83 luo et al 2015 wang et al 2015 and wue by 23 90 bu et al 2013 respectively the gravel sand mulch treatment was observed to increase maize yield by 17 70 and wue by 15 51 zhu et al 2015 straw mulch treatment was observed to increase maize yield by 22 24 and wue by 15 21 yan et al 2017 although different results from mulching technologies were obtained between our research and other investigations the mulching effects on increasing maize yields and wue were consistent the smaller yields and wue for the two treatments that applied the 1 mm straw with black or transparent plastic film mulches implied the slight decrease effects of yields and wue when applying straw under plastic film mulching gao and li 2005 indicated that straw mulching may reduce crop yield in arid region chen et al 2005 showed that the crop yield reduction was caused by low temperature at early growth stage and liang et al 2011 showed that straw mulching had a significant cooling effect previous studies showed that although no tillage with straw mulching could improve soil quality but in some areas its low temperature effect induced the decrease of yield from previous investigations comparison of effects on soil water storage et c t crop growth yield and wue between mulching of plastic film gravel sand and straw could be conducted but a consistent rank of mulching effectiveness is difficult to obtain because of the complicated nature of field soil water movement and crop growth under different climatic soil crop type and species conditions in this research a comprehensive rank for mulching effects on the annual and two year averages of soil water storage during the jointing period et c t maximal stem diameter yield and wue for 2015 2016 is presented in table 5 the ranks of performances for 7 mulching treatments and ck on soil water storage during the jointing period et c t maximal stem diameter yield and wue varied in 2015 and 2016 but the best performances for soil water storage in jointing stage et c t and maximal stem diameter was found in the bpf1 treatment for yield and wue the bpf0 treatment was greatest the lowest soil water storage during jointing period et c t maximal stem diameter yield and wue were all in the ck treatment for the two year averages of soil water storage in jointing stage crop growth yield and wue the highest and lowest ranked treatments were consistent in 2015 and 2016 but the treatment rankings for soil water storage at jointing stage et c t crop growth yield and wue differed slightly between years considering economics and costs associated with implementing mulching treatments treatment ranking for wue averaged over two years was bpf0 bpf1 trpf1 trpf0 st1 sand st100 ck although there is uncertainty for the results of different years soils crops and climatic regions this rank supplies a reference for agricultural water management under mulching conditions 4 conclusions effects of different mulches on soil water storage during the jointing period et c t height stem diameter yields and wue of summer maize varied for plastic film gravel sand and straw mulches the reduction of et c t relative to the ck ranged from 1 to 6 in 2015 and from 1 to 3 in 2016 for the 7 mulching treatments from the θ v of soil profile all mulching treatments effectively conserved surface soil moisture during the whole growth period of summer maize the increase of soil water storage during the jointing period relative to the ck ranged from 42 to 64 in 2015 and from 23 to 68 in 2016 for the 7 mulching treatments in both 2015 and 2016 the stem diameter plant height lai yield and wue of summer maize of all mulched treatments increased significantly compared with the ck yield increases of the 7 mulching treatments relative to the ck ranged from 5 to 31 in 2015 and from 17 to 37 in 2016 respectively wue of the 7 mulching treatments compared with the ck increased 1 1 4 5kghm 2 mm 1 in 2015 and 1 5 3 6kghm 2 mm 1 in 2016 respectively by comprehensive analysis of the treatment rankings of soil water storage during the jointing period et c t crop growth yield and wue for 2015 2016 and two year average the black plastic film mulching technology was finally recommended as the best one because it increased the wue the largest among the 7 mulching treatments

decreased soil water evaporation during early crop growth stages which saved water and accelerated maize growth in the middle and later stages for the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons average soil water storage during the jointing stage increased 32 39 48 57 61 62 and 66 yield increased 13 18 23 28 29 34 and 29 and wue increased 1 4 2 1 3 0 3 2 3 5 4 1 and 3 6kghm 2 mm 1 compared with the ck treatment for the st100 sand st1 trpf0 trpf1 bpf0 and bpf1 treatments respectively in general yield and wue increases were greatest in the bpf0 treatment followed by trpf1 bpf1 trpf0 st1 sand and st100 yield and wue increases in the st100 and sand treatments were small this research revealed that plastic mulch had the largest yield and wue increase of which black plastic film was better than transparent plastic film the yield and wue increase of gravel sand mulching was larger than 100 mm in length straw mulching but less than 1 mm in length straw mulching keywords mulching technology

for different mulches increased to different extents correspondingly the cumulative soil water evaporation or et c t decreased and results were similar for investigations that incorporated two mulching technologies of plastic film mulch gravel sand mulch and straw mulch plastic film mulch has been shown to reduce soil water evaporation and facilitate the movement of water moved from deeper soil layers to the topsoil by vapor transport and capillarity wang et al 2015 resulting in higher topsoil water storage than the bare soil higher soil water storage promoted crop growth as indicated by greater plant height biomass accumulation lai grain yield and wue fan et al 2016 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 the effectiveness of evaporation reduction associated with gravel sand mulch was positively correlated with the thickness of covering and was inversely related to particle size diaz et al 2005 xie et al 2006 yang et al 2014 further field trials with gravel sand mulch show this practice could effectively ameliorate soil conditions promote plant growth crop yield and wue bu et al 2013 sun et al 2012 the field gravel mulching conducted on the loess plateau of china

conservation and yield increase were effective and straw rate of 9000kg ha was preferable for the loess plateau of china cai et al 2015 the effects of various mulching materials on actual evapotranspiration et c crop growth yields and wue have been widely studied however most previous research has focused on mulching with one or two materials or combined mulching technology with the other field management practices such as ridge furrow irrigation wang et al 2016 yan et al 2017 few studies have directly evaluated the effects of multiple mulching materials on soil water storage et c yields and wue furthermore the increases of soil water storage crop growth yield and wue under mulching conditions were uncertain and a direct assessment of mulching efficiency for plastic film mulching gravel sand and straw mulching were difficult to obtain in previous research because the field soils conditions the crop species the climatic background and management strategies were diverse this research aims to assess the effects of seven single or combined mulching technologies on soil water storage et c growth processes yields and wue of summer maize using the self designed meso scale lysimeter observation equipment to reveal the mechanism of different mulching technologies on decrease et c and promoting yields and to quantify the response of increasing wue to various mulching technologies and determine the optimum mulching application in the studied area 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study site and the experimental equipment summer maize growth experiments over two growing seasons under different mulching conditions under a rain shelter were conducted in yangling china with a longitude of 108 24 e latitude of 34 20 n and an average altitude of 521m above sea level the multiyear average frost free days are 221 mean annual temperature is 12 9 c 2196h average sunshine and 660mm annual precipitation respectively the region is characterized as a warm and wet monsoon semi humid climate zone meso scale lysimeters with a basal diameter of 38cm a height of 65cm with 1 cm thick plexiglass walls were place on load cells modern haofang instrument co ltd shenzhen china 150kg capacity 0 02 accuracy for monitoring total lysimeter weight for evapotranspiration et estimates and were held in place by a stainless steel supports the bottom of each lysimeter contained uniformly distributed holes 5mm diameter and was lined with filter paper other equipment used included a three sided rain shelter height of 3 0m a width of 6 0m and a length of 7 1m and was open at the south side an automatic data collection system and a solar panel which was connected to all of the 24 lysimeters fig 1 each lysimeter demonstrated similar reliability in measuring daily actual evapotranspiration et c d to daamen et al 1993 who showed that the method was simple and accurate a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific inc usa was used to provide excitation voltage and record output data from each load cell at a frequency of 1h the 24 lysimeters were positioned randomly under the rain shelter in order to keep the same surroundings as the field for the summer maize the surface of the lysimeters were placed flush with the ground 2 2 mulching treatments soil properties and packing a total of 8 treatments were designed including no mulching and 7 different surface mulching treatments table 1 the eight treatments with three replications i e 24 meso scale lysimeters were distributed randomly the surface mulched materials were gravel sand chopped straw at lengths of 1 and 100mm transparent and black plastic films and plastic films overlying chopped straws for convenience the treatments names were simplified table 1 the mulching materials were applied on soil surface the plastic film was purchased from gansu fuyu plastic industry co ltd http www fy6521680 cn the sand gravels were collected from the wei river bank in yangling china and sieved with an 8 mm in diameter screen the summer maize growth experiments lasted from june 27 to october 17 in 2015 and from june 19 to october 7 in 2016 covering the complete growth stages from sowing to harvesting the soil used in the experiments was classified as lou series collected from the top 30cm of crop field in north yangling shaanxi china the lou soils were air dried crushed and sieved to pass an 8 mm screen to remove roots stones and debris the particle size distribution was measured using a longbench mastersizer 2000 type laser diffractometry malvern instruments england the soil was 11 clay 29 silt and 60 sand and had a sandy loam texture according to the usda texture classification system the weather dried θ r and saturated water contents θ s were measured gravimetrically using the oven dry method with values of 0 08 and 0 48cm3cm 3 the field capacity θf was 0 39cm3cm 3 and analyzed using the wilcox method salter and williams 1965 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured by the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 with a value of 0 02 cmmin 1 the wilting coefficient was measured by high speed refrigerated centrifuge hitachi himac cr21g ii with a value of 0 13cm3 cm 3 the lou soils with initial water content of θ r were packed into each container to a depth of 55cm to achieve a bulk density of 1 44gcm 3 the fertilizers with an n p2o5 k2o ratio of 1 0 5 0 8 were mixed with the lou soils and applied at the depth of 5 10cm 2 3 irrigation soil sampling and plant growth experiments after allowing the containers to settle for 24h 200mm of water equivalent of field capacity water storage was applied to the surface of the lysimeters after water application all the containers were covered by plastic films to avoid uneven evaporation from soil surface twenty four hours after the first irrigation the plastic film was removed from the containers 4 summer maize seeds whose variety was qinlong 12 were sown and two plants were kept when the seeds germinated and grew to 5cm height for each soil container during the summer maize growth stages when average soil water content θ ave of the bpf1 treatment as measured by the lysimeters reached 70 of θf i e when the soils in a most water conserved treatment became dry 60mm irrigation amount was applied to all of the 8 treatments irrigation time was set between 18 00 and 20 00 to reduce evaporation of irrigation water for all of the 8 treatments total irrigation applied was 470mm in 2015 and 530mm in 2016 respectively after every two irrigation events soil samples were taken with a 2 cm diameter steel auger below the mulching layers at a 5 cm interval along the vertical profile the holes were backfilled with equal mass and water content of soil immediately after the sampling the samples were weighed oven dried and re weighed to measure θ the soil water storage was calculated over the 55cm depth and changes in storage were reconciled with the lysimeter data the stem diameter of summer maize was measured using a vernier caliper the height and leaf area of summer maize were measured once with a tape every 10days leaf area was the product of leaf length the largest width and 0 75 correction factor according to mckee 1964 the lai was the averaged leaf area for two summer maize plants dividing the cross area of horizontal plane in soil container 1134cm2 at maturity each summer maize plant was harvested manually the panicle length and diameter were measured with a vernier caliper total grain weight was measured after the grains were oven dried at 105 c for 30min and dried at 75 c to constant weight in an oven the average values of six crops were used for comparison of yield related variables under different mulches et c t total actual evapotranspiration mm was estimated with et c d daily actual evapotranspiration mm within the summer maize growth stages et c d was calculated by the measured values by lysimeter 1 e t c d 10 σ w i 1 j w i j n q where w is weight of soil container g wij and w i 1 j are w of ith and i 1 th days at jth hour and j 0 1 2 23 n 24 q is surface area of soil container cm2 wue was calculated as the summer maize yield divided by et c t zhou et al 2011 the relative errors of the measured et c d by lysimeter varied from 1 to 9 the et c t soil water storage and yield related indices of all eight treatments were analyzed to test statistical difference with an anova using the spss 17 0 at a significant level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of soil water storage and evapotranspiration under different mulches there were climatic differences between the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons during all growth stages of summer maize the daily temperature generally ranged from 17 5 to 28 2 c and 20 7 29 7 c in 2015 and 2016 respectively the average daily air temperature was 22 9 c in 2015 and 25 2 c in 2016 respectively the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated by et 0 calculator liu 2016 the mean et 0 values over the growing season were 5 51 and 5 82 mmd 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the average pan evaporation values within the same period were 3 92 mmd 1 in 2015 and 4 49 mmd 1 in 2016 respectively the average et c values of ck were 3 73 mmd 1 in 2015 and 4 65 mmd 1 in 2016 respectively higher temperature et 0 and pan evaporation in 2016 resulted in higher et c for the maize growth period the temporal variations of et c d daily actual evapotranspiration mm in fig 2 reflect the meteorological conditions for both growing seasons for all of the 8 treatments et c d increased to a peak after each irrigation then decreased rapidly in fig 2 a for 2015 et c d in the ck treatment was obviously larger during the first 20days after sowing but was much smaller in the subsequent 14days than the other mulching treatments later variations of et c d basically had similar pattern for different treatments but the peak values changed for different treatments because et c d was not only affected by the atmospheric evaporative demand and irrigation amount but also depended on soil water storage larger et c d at the earlier crop growth stages would result in smaller et c d in the later growth stages since the total irrigation amounts were same for different treatments in the same year similar variation patterns of et c d for different mulching treatments were found for 2016 fig 2 b especially after 50days of sowing the et c d values of the mulched treatments were obviously smaller than the ck treatment within 22days after sowing which showed the soil water evaporation inhibition effects of different mulches the curves for cumulative evapotranspiration et c cum also displayed larger evapotranspiration values of the ck treatment in the jointing stage but differed slightly from about 40days after sowing till harvesting fig 3 this showed that the evaporation inhibition effects of mulches were mainly in the stages when crops were still small and soil water evaporation contributed more than transpiration to et c li et al 2013b confirmed that during rapid growth periods transpiration accounts for a large proportion of et in maize li et al 2013a reported that the different plastic film mulches plastic film biodegradable and liquid film and straw mulching treatments reduced et within 60 days after sowing of spring maize increased et by 4 6 17 0mm 60 90 days after sowing but had almost similar et during 90 120 days after sowing when crop leaves began to senesce crop transpiration and canopy cover reduced soil water evaporation dominated et our results agreed well with other research in indicating lower et c d and et c cum for 7 mulching treatments than ck at early growth stage fan et al 2016 li et al 2013a relative to the ck treatment et c t total actual evapotranspiration of the mulching treatments differed significantly except st100 there were general decrease of et c t for the two experimental years for different mulching treatments but the values were all small table 2 there was smaller decrease rate of et c t both in 2015 6 and 2016 4 this didn t mean mulches on surface affected soil water storages small but meant et c t differed small for both mulch and no mulching treatments the main differences in et c d were in the jointing stage table 3 the stored additional water in the soils by the mulches than bare soils in the early crop growth stages was used for plant transpiration and growth in later crop stages compared with the ck treatment the soil water storage of 7 different mulching treatments increased 0 5 19 9mm in 2015 and 7 7 21 3mm in 2016 the lower et c d of different mulching treatments resulted in larger soil water storage both in the jointing stages of 2015 and 2016 with a treatment rank of ck st100 sand st1 trpf0 trpf1 bpf0 bpf1 fig 4 average soil water storage over the two growing seasons at the tasseling stage did not differ significantly among the ck and the different mulching treatments soil water storage during the filling and maturity stages slightly increased from ck to st100 sand trpf0 trpf1 bpf0 st1 and bpf1 total soil water storage increased most in the bpf1 treatment but the least in st100 indicating black plastic film over 1mm wheat straw had the most beneficial effects on soil water storage and the 100mm wheat straw mulch showed the least improvement in soil water storage some other research indicated that when compared with ck soil water storage increased 6 52mm for plastic film mulching treatment 15 44mm for gravel sand mulching treatment and 20 29mm for straw mulching treatment bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 zhu et al 2015 our results were generally consistent with theirs the soil water storage of st1 was larger than the three plastic film mulching treatments the reason may be that when straw was chopped to 1mm in length the porosity of the mulching layer was greatly reduced and the evaporation was also reduced the distribution of volumetric soil water content θ v before each irrigation in different growth stages of summer maize for 2015 and 2016 is presented in fig 5 the θ v distribution in vertical profiles were more similar during filling and mature stages than during jointing and tasseling stages between 2015 and 2016 for both 2015 and 2016 in the jointing tasseling filling and mature stages θ v variations in vertical profiles agreed well with that of soil water storage in 2015 for the jointing tasseling filling and mature stages fig 5 a d larger θ v values were observed for the 4 plastic mulching treatments compared with ck θ v of the 1 mm straw mulch treatment was the largest at the depths 25 40cm among the 8 treatments followed by θ v of the sand gravel mulch and 100 mm straw mulch treatments θ v values in profiles were much smaller after the jointing stage there was general similarly distribution of θ v in different growth stages of 2016 except that 1 there was even smaller differences between the 8 treatments in the tasseling stage fig 5f this was because there was higher temperature in the summer of 2016 which accelerated the evapotranspiration of summer maize the stored water in soils were taken full advantage by the summer maize and θ v decreased to as low as the wilting coefficient 0 13cm3 cm 3 for all the 8 different mulching technologies however the effects of different mulching treatments were still obvious because the available water that summer maize utilized was different which can be shown from the growth parameters see section 3 3 2 θ v of the 1 mm straw mulch treatment was smaller than the 4 plastic mulching treatments 3 2 dynamics of summer maize growth the increased soil water storage early in the growing season under the mulching treatments was effectively used for the later growth of summer maize generally smaller final stem diameter plant height and lai were observed in 2015 than 2016 for all of the treatments because of the climatic environmental differences fig 6 in both 2015 and 2016 stem diameter plant height and lai of the 7 mulching treatments were obviously higher than the ck treatment the final stem diameter had a general treatment rank of bpf1 trpf1 st1 bpf0 sand st100 trpf0 ck the two year average maximal plant height was higher under plastic film mulching treatment than gravel sand and straw mulching treatments maximal lai was higher under straw mulch treatment than under plastic film and gravel sand mulch treatments lai of the 7 mulching treatments abruptly increased compared with the ck within 60days after sowing then rapidly decreased compared with the ck at later growth stages which was similar to previous studies fan et al 2016 wang et al 2011 xu et al 2015 li et al 2013a b indicated that lai ranked in plastic film mulch treatment straw mulch treatment gravel sand mulch treatment which was different from our results 3 3 yield related indices of summer maize under different mulching conditions the yield related variables of summer maize in 2015 and 2016 for different mulching treatments are given in table 4 as indicated the differences between the maximum and the minimum spike lengths in the 8 treatments were 1 9cm and between the maximum and the minimum diameters were 7 2mm in 2015 respectively but were 2 3cm and 11 8mm in 2016 respectively weight of 100 kernels and yields varied as mulches changed in general differences in spike length and the other growth variables between various mulching treatments were insignificant especially in 2015 for the yield and wue there were significant differences between ck and various plastic film mulches i e bpf1 trpf0 trpf1 and bpf0 in either 2015 or 2016 yield rankings for mulching treatments were bpf0 trpf1 trpf0 bpf1 st1 st100 sand ck in 2015 but bpf0 bpf1 trpf1 sand trpf0 st1 st100 ck in 2016 wue rankings were bpf0 bpf1 trpf1 trpf0 st1 st100 sand ck in 2015 and bpf0 bpf1 trpf1 trpf0 sand st1 st100 ck in 2016 averaged over both growing seasons yield increased by 34 29 29 28 23 18 and 13 for bpf0 trpf1 bpf1 trpf0 st1 sand and st100 compared with the ck respectively averaged over both growing seasons the wue increased 4 1 3 6 3 5 3 2 3 0 2 1 and 1 35kghm 2 mm 1 for bpf0 bpf1 trpf1 trpf0 st1 sand and st100 than ck respectively in general the yield and wue followed a consistent order of mulching treatments indicating generally better efficiency of plastic film mulching than gravel sand and straw mulching technologies the black plastic film treatment had the largest yields and wue among the four plastic film mulching treatments while the transparent plastic film plus chopped 1 mm in length straw had the lowest yields and wue overall the increase of maize yield from our research fell into the range of 24 37 for plastic film mulch treatment of 5 32 for gravel sand mulch treatment and of 9 29 for straw mulch treatment respectively the increase of wue ranged from 29 40 for plastic film mulch treatment of 9 34 for the gravel sand mulch treatment and of 10 33 for the straw mulch treatment respectively higher yield and wue were obtained under the 7 mulching treatments than compared with the ck in the two experimental years some related studies have demonstrated that the plastic film mulch treatment increased maize yield by 44 83 luo et al 2015 wang et al 2015 and wue by 23 90 bu et al 2013 respectively the gravel sand mulch treatment was observed to increase maize yield by 17 70 and wue by 15 51 zhu et al 2015 straw mulch treatment was observed to increase maize yield by 22 24 and wue by 15 21 yan et al 2017 although different results from mulching technologies were obtained between our research and other investigations the mulching effects on increasing maize yields and wue were consistent the smaller yields and wue for the two treatments that applied the 1 mm straw with black or transparent plastic film mulches implied the slight decrease effects of yields and wue when applying straw under plastic film mulching gao and li 2005 indicated that straw mulching may reduce crop yield in arid region chen et al 2005 showed that the crop yield reduction was caused by low temperature at early growth stage and liang et al 2011 showed that straw mulching had a significant cooling effect previous studies showed that although no tillage with straw mulching could improve soil quality but in some areas its low temperature effect induced the decrease of yield from previous investigations comparison of effects on soil water storage et c t crop growth yield and wue between mulching of plastic film gravel sand and straw could be conducted but a consistent rank of mulching effectiveness is difficult to obtain because of the complicated nature of field soil water movement and crop growth under different climatic soil crop type and species conditions in this research a comprehensive rank for mulching effects on the annual and two year averages of soil water storage during the jointing period et c t maximal stem diameter yield and wue for 2015 2016 is presented in table 5 the ranks of performances for 7 mulching treatments and ck on soil water storage during the jointing period et c t maximal stem diameter yield and wue varied in 2015 and 2016 but the best performances for soil water storage in jointing stage et c t and maximal stem diameter was found in the bpf1 treatment for yield and wue the bpf0 treatment was greatest the lowest soil water storage during jointing period et c t maximal stem diameter yield and wue were all in the ck treatment for the two year averages of soil water storage in jointing stage crop growth yield and wue the highest and lowest ranked treatments were consistent in 2015 and 2016 but the treatment rankings for soil water storage at jointing stage et c t crop growth yield and wue differed slightly between years considering economics and costs associated with implementing mulching treatments treatment ranking for wue averaged over two years was bpf0 bpf1 trpf1 trpf0 st1 sand st100 ck although there is uncertainty for the results of different years soils crops and climatic regions this rank supplies a reference for agricultural water management under mulching conditions 4 conclusions effects of different mulches on soil water storage during the jointing period et c t height stem diameter yields and wue of summer maize varied for plastic film gravel sand and straw mulches the reduction of et c t relative to the ck ranged from 1 to 6 in 2015 and from 1 to 3 in 2016 for the 7 mulching treatments from the θ v of soil profile all mulching treatments effectively conserved surface soil moisture during the whole growth period of summer maize the increase of soil water storage during the jointing period relative to the ck ranged from 42 to 64 in 2015 and from 23 to 68 in 2016 for the 7 mulching treatments in both 2015 and 2016 the stem diameter plant height lai yield and wue of summer maize of all mulched treatments increased significantly compared with the ck yield increases of the 7 mulching treatments relative to the ck ranged from 5 to 31 in 2015 and from 17 to 37 in 2016 respectively wue of the 7 mulching treatments compared with the ck increased 1 1 4 5kghm 2 mm 1 in 2015 and 1 5 3 6kghm 2 mm 1 in 2016 respectively by comprehensive analysis of the treatment rankings of soil water storage during the jointing period et c t crop growth yield and wue for 2015 2016 and two year average the black plastic film mulching technology was finally recommended as the best one because it increased the wue the largest among the 7 mulching treatments

bacteria in sewage inflow outflow and groundwater total coliform tc and e coli were detected in the majority of samples from all surface and groundwater sites the temporal trend of fecal bacteria at l1 was relatively high and stable except for few lower values in may and august fig 3 similar temporal trends were found at other sites e g l6 l11 at the outlet of the wanan catchment l12 tc and e coli had peak concentrations on 12 july 2016 and 2 august 2016 which coincided with heavy rainfall events on the sampling day daily outflow 1 15 m3 s 1 and 0 68 m3 s 1 respectively fig 3 tc and e coli

l8 the intensive sampling during the storm event also indicated that tc and e coli concentrations tended to increase up to streamflow peak and decrease with flow recession at all stream sites the tc concentrations ranged from 5 4 to 7 4 log10 mpn 100 ml 1 and e coli ranged from 3 6 to 6 2 log10 mpn 100 ml 1 indicating a high contaminated status fig 4 the level of fecal contamination in groundwater was also found to vary seasonally with the highest counts of fecal bacteria and activities detected from may 2016 to august 2016 fig 5 the lower fecal bacteria concentrations were obtained during cooler months with the lowest fecal bacteria concentrations occurring in february after an extremely cold period the change in magnitude of tc concentration about 3 5log10 was about one order lower than that of e coli 3 2 spatial variations of fecal bacteria contamination under complex land uses fecal bacteria in surface water varied with flow direction from the upstream area to the catchment outlet table 2 the water quality of the water flowing through ecological ditches between l1 and l2 were improved significantly by the reduction of fecal bacteria by about two orders of magnitude p 0 01 the average removal effects were about two orders of magnitude for tc of 97 7 and for e coli of 99 5 upstream of the main channel l3 and l8 received greater amounts of fecal bacteria from sewage water l1 than those in tributary 1 l4 average concentrations of fecal bacteria were also significantly greater in tributary 2 and 3 than those downstream l9 and l12 during non flood periods in the cold months p 0 05 however in the flood period concentrations of fecal bacteria among these sites were not significantly different average concentrations of fecal bacteria in tributary 4 l11 were at a high level during the whole year despite the descending trend of tc and e coli concentrations downstream the agricultural system still emitted a large number of tc and e coli out of the catchment with 6 20e 14 mpn and 2 43e 13 mpn in the whole year respectively spatial variation of fecal bacteria concentrations in groundwater fig 5 indicated that both tc and e coli counts in groundwater were greater in residential areas r than those in forest areas f and cultivated agricultural areas c except in may when e coli counts seemed to be greater in forest areas greater temporal variation of e coli was observed in residential areas r and forest areas f with coefficient of variation values of 0 36 and 0 42 compared to 0 25 in cultivated areas the score plot fig 6 a showed that site l11 was defined as an e coli relevant site near a pig slaughterhouse the site l1 was detected with the tc dominative comparing with other sites and then defined as a tc relevant site the rest of the sites had water quality characteristics and hydrologic characteristics similar to site l1 for groundwater fig 6b w1 w3 w4 w6 w9 and w10 were defined as tc relevant sites while w2 w5 w7 and w8 were e coli relevant sites the tc and e coli in surface water were not sensitive to identify differences among all sampling sites since the distribution of sampling sites were clustered while tc and e coli were more sensitive to differentiate between the high and low fecal source influenced sites in groundwater because of the scattered distribution patterns of sampling sites 3 3 integrated assessment of microbial water quality in the catchment the chemical parameters in the water bodies table 2 indicated that electrical conductivity ec and turbidity were greatest in the flood months the ph remained nearly unchanged through the monitoring period mean water temperature in the river was about 5 c higher than groundwater p 0 01 similar to fecal bacteria ec and turbidity were significantly greater in tributaries than in the mainstream p 0 01 groundwater had relatively high ec and low turbidity compared to surface waters in general we detected positively correlation relationships between tc and e coli during all the sampling dates for surface water sites r 0 686 p 0 01 and for groundwater sites r 0 562 p 0 01 table 3 tc and e coli were significantly correlated with ec and turbidity at surface water sites p 0 05 but not with temperature p 0 05 a less significant relationship between tc and e coli in groundwater was found for groundwater tc and e coli were positively correlated with temperature and turbidity p 0 01 was negatively correlated with ec p 0 05 fecal bacteria were more sensitive to water temperature in groundwater than in surface water according to the microbial water quality guideline for surface water table 1 in china and other countries the water quality of all surface monitoring sites generally exceeded grade b with low moderate health risk fig 7 the water quality in the non flood period was better than in the flood period in the non flood period water quality in the mainstream and tributaries was poor since almost 60 water samples were categorized as grade d poorest water quality only 20 and 15 of water samples from mainstream and tributary areas of surface waters were in grade b and grade c respectively during the flood period the water quality tended to be worse as about 90 surface water samples were categorized into grade d due to the high frequency of storm flushes that caused more sewer failure and overflow from residential area and favorable survival conditions for groundwater almost 90 samples indicated the presence of tc and e coli during the study period and there was serious deterioration in water quality during the flood period fig 7 in the non flood period 75 water samples derived from low human influence sites c or c f had low moderate health risk comparing with 50 from high human influence sites r or c r high human influence sites had 12 higher frequency for high health risk than low human influence sites during the high flow period the microbial water quality in groundwater was poorer since about 90 water samples had high health risk the groundwater in the catchment was not suitable for drinking bathing or cooking 4 discussion most previous microbial investigations had focused on urban areas and regional issues with sporadic sampling strategy or only in concerned sites isobe et al 2004 george et al 2004 hrdinka et al 2012 fuhrimann et al 2016 this study examined semi monthly variation of fecal bacteria tc and e coli in a small hilly agricultural catchment the factors affecting the temporal distribution of microbes in terrestrial habitats such as climate geochemical properties temperature ph humidity salinity the presence of other bacteria viruses and predators and the metabolic capacities of the bacteria byappanahalli et al 2003 ishii and sadowsky 2008 korajkic et al 2013 could be explained better in this confined environment in this study the consecutive sampling campaign observed fecal bacteria concentrations tended to be greater from may to september peaking in late summer figs 3 and 4 which is coincided with higher temperature and more rainfall events in this period ec and turbidity in surface waters were also greater during this flood period than in non flood period it approved a strong link between indicator bacteria survival and contamination season dutka and kwan 1980 oliver et al 2006 it was verified again that temperature was controlling bacteria survival in groundwater rather than in surface water in this catchment table 3 meanwhile the role of rainfall events was also important due to the flushing effects especially in surface waters other researchers george et al 2004 hrdinka et al 2012 also found that high flow events had significantly greater impact on water quality than periods of low flow a rapid response of fecal bacteria concentrations to rainfall events was found with distinct flushing effects in this study figs 4 and 5 on semi monthly base tc and e coli were both significantly correlated p 0 05 with streamflow on the sampling day in the downstream site l8 l12 so it is confirmed that erosive rainfall events occurred in warmer months in this catchment could expedite detachment processes of soil particles and increase the amount of sediment transport and particle attached bacteria storm runoff led to relatively short periods of washing of animal wastes from uplands non point source and domestic sewage from residential area as well as the re suspension of sediment trapped bacteria in streams ribolzi et al 2011 pandey et al 2012 pandey and soupir 2013 during the non flood period fecal bacteria concentration generally remained above 2 8 log10 mpn 100 ml 1 in streams which suggested that pollutants might have been directly deposited into the waterways either as a consequence of point discharge or livestock defecating into water isobe et al 2004 also inferred that the absence of high inflows could have minimized dilution and caused the high concentration of pollutants turbidity levels are thought to impact coliform densities through sediment associated transport from residential area and re suspension of sediment bound bacteria roper and marshall 1974 jamieson et al 2005 byamukama et al 2005 pandey et al 2012 pandey and soupir 2013 it is suggested that mixture of organic colloids and sediment is the most important transport vector of bacteria in this hilly agricultural region as tc and e coli were positively correlated with ec and turbidity the survival of fecal bacteria in sediments is primarily attributed to the availability of soluble organics davies et al 1995 dissolved nutrients mitch et al 2010 and other ions indicated by higher ec monaghan et al 2007 however both ec and turbidity exhibited strong temporal and spatial variation in this agricultural catchment due to the frequent occurrence of rainfall events and the patchy land uses which was also noted as catchment indexes pandey et al 2012 intensive spatial sampling showed that microbial distribution and presence in this catchment are heterogeneous due to its complex land use pattern fig 1 domestic sewage discharge from residential areas contributed most of the fecal bacteria load large amount of manure application in the vegetable planting fields near the residential area also posed a higher risk of soil contamination and subsequent adjacent aquatic contamination by flushing or leaching groundwater wells located in high density residential areas contained more fecal bacteria counts than from non residential areas cultivated land and forest in this catchment fig 5 confirming that the soil leaching processes could be significant for fecal bacteria transport george et al 2004 a less significant relationship table 3 between tc and e coli in groundwater might be ascribed to the soil physical properties as e coli with a smaller diameter than most of other bacteria wilkes et al 2009 could be more easily percolated into the groundwater even if these manure application zones are near to streams or if the animals have direct access to the stream then contamination of stream water by fecal bacteria will also be more probable monaghan et al 2009 it is suggested that the widespread non point sources related to the scattered residential area in this hilly catchment are the critical source areas and should be considered when designing monitoring projects and subsequent remediation strategies in this catchment the 300 m long ecological ditch between site l1 and l2 had been constructed to control water pollution from linshan township sewage inflows this wastewater treatment system includes simple artificial wetlands and natural trapezoidal ditches fig 2 kumwimba et al 2017 positive effects of nitrogen and phosphorus removal had been reported by kumwimba et al 2017 distinct removal efficiency of fecal bacteria 97 7 for tc and 99 5 for e coli through this ecological ditch was identified in this study table 2 which confirmed the constructed ditch system could trap great amount of sediment associated fecal bacteria via intercept and deposition vega et al 2003 and mohanty et al 2014 also found significant removal efficiency of bacteria and viruses in wetland system were both up to 3 orders of magnitude certain macrophytes might improve the removal effect of ecological ditch system by internalization or intercepting müller et al 2001 vymazal 2005 it was verified that tofieldia myriophyllum water hyacinth canna cress had higher removal rates of e coli than other plants in this catchment chen et al in review this research demonstrated the necessity of instrumenting integrated waste water treatment in rural areas in this type of hilly agricultural catchment with dense population 5 conclusions this study demonstrated comprehensively the microbial pollution by investigating tc and e coli with intensive temporal and spatial sampling strategies in a subtropical agricultural catchment in hilly area of upper reach of yangtze river bacteriological quality frequently exceeded water quality guidelines in groundwater and surface water in this catchment showing a high temporal and spatial variability during the observation period the flood season rainy season showed higher risk of microbial contamination compared to non flood season the possible linkages between source area and targets e g groundwater and catchment outlet were ascertained through both surface and subsurface pathways especially linking to residential areas e coli and tc were positively correlated with ec and turbidity indicating that mixture of organic colloids and sediment is the most important transport vector of bacteria in this catchment and turbidity should be an important indicator of microbial pollution in aquatic environment in this region the ecological ditch showed distinct removing effects around two orders of magnitude the current research merits to appropriate sampling design when investigating microbial pollution and benefits to prediction of microbial pollution and adoption of optimized environmental management in the similar agricultural catchments in upper yangtze river acknowledgements this study

11551,waterborne microbial pollution remains poorly understood in developing countries especially in rural areas the transport of point e g untreated domestic wastewater and non point sources of fecal bacteria such as total coliform tc and escherichia coli e coli and their spatial and temporal patterns were identified in a typical small agricultural catchment in a hilly area of subtropical china over the sampling area 460 water samples from 24 sites were collected during a period of 12 months and a remediation option using an existing ecological ditch was evaluated the results showed that 70 surface water samples exceeded the guideline of 1000 tc mpn 100 ml 1 in the catchment also 90 of groundwater samples exceeded the guideline of 10 mpn e coli 100 ml 1 for safe drinking water higher concentrations of tc and e coli occurred both in the warm and rainy season in surface water and groundwater tc and e coli concentrations in surface water tributaries and groundwater near residential areas were greater than those in downstream water bodies a 300 m long vegetated ecological ditch greatly reduced average concentrations tc of 97 7 and e coli of 99 5 tc and e coli concentrations were significantly correlated with electrical conductivity and turbidity both in surface water and groundwater indicating that mixtures of organic colloids and sediment were the most important transport vector for pathogens however temperature only showed a controlling effect on bacteria concentration in groundwater in this particular catchment the current research could help predict microbial risks

pose to human health increases with population growth and poverty vermeulen et al 2015 rural catchments in developing countries face significant pathogen exposure due to poor sanitary conditions economic constraints chen et al 2013 and insufficient knowledge about the distribution and prevention of microbial contaminants river pond and lake waters are used for irrigation recreational activities drinking bathing and cooking in remote rural areas in china and other developing countries so the economic constraints and poor infrastructure can result in large proportions of the population being exposed to severely contaminated water chen et al 2013 jamieson et al 2003 edge et al 2012 livestock excretion and untreated human fecal wastes contribute particularly to waterborne pathogen contamination in rural catchments yang et al 2012 a similar situation can apply in downstream periurban areas where population densities are high and the water supplies can be often being informal and therefore unregulated figueras et al 1997 in the heavily populated region of the upper reaches of the yangtze river microbial contamination has been reported in the fu and jialing rivers

provided limited information when dealing with field management at catchment scale knowledge of the distribution of potential sewage manure and wildlife sources of fecal contamination is a prerequisite for adopted mitigation measures u s environmental protection agency 2005 as high levels of pathogenic bacteria input to headwater catchments might pose a threat to local water bodies and the downstream river basin it is important that the factors that control the transport and fate of fecal bacteria in water bodies in rural catchments are identified this information can provide valuable insight for designing fecal bacteria monitoring project and further reducing pollution risk and human exposure the objective of the present study was to investigate fecal bacteria total

coli during all the sampling dates for surface water sites r 0 686 p 0 01 and for groundwater sites r 0 562 p 0 01 table 3 tc and e coli were significantly correlated with ec and turbidity at surface water sites p 0 05 but not with temperature p 0 05 a less significant relationship between tc and e coli in groundwater was found for groundwater tc and e coli were positively correlated with temperature and turbidity p 0 01 was negatively correlated with ec p 0 05 fecal bacteria were more sensitive to water temperature in groundwater than in surface water according to the microbial water quality guideline for surface water table 1 in china and other countries the water quality of all surface monitoring sites generally exceeded grade b with low moderate health risk fig 7 the water quality in the non flood period was better than in the flood period in the non flood period water quality in the mainstream and tributaries was poor since almost 60 water samples were categorized as grade d poorest water quality only 20 and 15 of water samples from mainstream and tributary areas of surface waters were in grade b and grade c respectively during the flood period the water quality tended to be worse as about 90 surface water samples were categorized into grade d due to the high frequency of storm flushes that caused more sewer failure and overflow from residential area and favorable survival conditions for groundwater almost 90 samples indicated the presence of tc and e coli during the study period and there was serious deterioration in water quality during the flood period fig 7 in the non flood period 75 water samples derived from low human influence sites c or c f had low moderate health risk comparing with 50 from high human influence sites r or c r high human influence sites had 12 higher frequency for high health risk than low human influence sites during the high flow period the microbial water quality in groundwater was poorer since about 90 water samples had high health risk the groundwater in the catchment was not suitable for drinking bathing or cooking 4 discussion most previous microbial investigations had focused on urban areas and regional issues with sporadic sampling strategy or only in concerned sites isobe et al 2004 george et al 2004 hrdinka et al 2012 fuhrimann et al 2016 this study examined semi monthly variation of fecal bacteria tc and e coli in a small hilly agricultural catchment the factors affecting the temporal distribution of microbes in terrestrial habitats such as climate geochemical properties temperature ph humidity salinity the presence of other bacteria viruses and predators and the metabolic capacities of the bacteria byappanahalli et al 2003 ishii and sadowsky 2008 korajkic et al 2013 could be explained better in this confined environment in this study the consecutive sampling campaign observed fecal bacteria concentrations tended to be greater from may to september peaking in late summer figs 3 and 4 which is coincided with higher temperature and more rainfall events in this period ec and turbidity in surface waters were also greater during this flood period than in non flood period it approved a strong link between indicator bacteria survival and contamination season dutka and kwan 1980 oliver et al 2006 it was verified again that temperature was controlling bacteria survival in groundwater rather than in surface water in this catchment table 3 meanwhile the role of rainfall events was also important due to the flushing effects especially in surface waters other researchers george et al 2004 hrdinka et al 2012 also found that high flow events had significantly greater impact on water quality than periods of low flow a rapid response of fecal bacteria concentrations to rainfall events was found with distinct flushing effects in this study figs 4 and 5 on semi monthly base tc and e coli were both significantly correlated p 0 05 with streamflow on the sampling day in the downstream site l8 l12 so it is confirmed that erosive rainfall events occurred in warmer months in this catchment could expedite detachment processes of soil particles and increase the amount of sediment transport and particle attached bacteria storm runoff led to relatively short periods of washing of animal wastes from uplands non point source and domestic sewage from residential area as well as the re suspension of sediment trapped bacteria in streams ribolzi et al 2011 pandey et al 2012 pandey and soupir 2013 during the non flood period fecal bacteria concentration generally remained above 2 8 log10 mpn 100 ml 1 in streams which suggested that pollutants might have been directly deposited into the waterways either as a consequence of point discharge or livestock defecating into water isobe et al 2004 also inferred that the absence of high inflows could have minimized dilution and caused the high concentration of pollutants turbidity levels are thought to impact coliform densities through sediment associated transport from residential area and re suspension of sediment bound bacteria roper and marshall 1974 jamieson et al 2005 byamukama et al 2005 pandey et al 2012 pandey and soupir 2013 it is suggested that mixture of organic colloids and sediment is the most important transport vector of bacteria in this hilly agricultural region as tc and e coli were positively correlated with ec and turbidity the survival of fecal bacteria in sediments is primarily attributed to the availability of soluble organics davies et al 1995 dissolved nutrients mitch et al 2010 and other ions indicated by higher ec monaghan et al 2007 however both ec and turbidity exhibited strong temporal and spatial variation in this agricultural catchment due to the frequent occurrence of rainfall events and the patchy land uses which was also noted as catchment indexes pandey et al 2012 intensive spatial sampling showed that microbial distribution and presence in this catchment are heterogeneous due to its complex land use pattern fig 1 domestic sewage discharge from residential areas contributed most of the fecal bacteria load large amount of manure application in the vegetable planting fields near the residential area also posed a higher risk of soil contamination and subsequent adjacent aquatic contamination by flushing or leaching groundwater wells located in high density residential areas contained more fecal bacteria counts than from non residential areas cultivated land and forest in this catchment fig 5 confirming that the soil leaching processes could be significant for fecal bacteria transport george et al 2004 a less significant relationship table 3 between tc and e coli in groundwater might be ascribed to the soil physical properties as e coli with a smaller diameter than most of other bacteria wilkes et al 2009 could be more easily percolated into the groundwater even if these manure application zones are near to streams or if the animals have direct access to the stream then contamination of stream water by fecal bacteria will also be more probable monaghan et al 2009 it is suggested that the widespread non point sources related to the scattered residential area in this hilly catchment are the critical source areas and should be considered when designing monitoring projects and subsequent remediation strategies in this catchment the 300 m long ecological ditch between site l1 and l2 had been constructed to control water pollution from linshan township sewage inflows this wastewater treatment system includes simple artificial wetlands and natural trapezoidal ditches fig 2 kumwimba et al 2017 positive effects of nitrogen and phosphorus removal had been reported by kumwimba et al 2017 distinct removal efficiency of fecal bacteria 97 7 for tc and 99 5 for e coli through this ecological ditch was identified in this study table 2 which confirmed the constructed ditch system could trap great amount of sediment associated fecal bacteria via intercept and deposition vega et al 2003 and mohanty et al 2014 also found significant removal efficiency of bacteria and viruses in wetland system were both up to 3 orders of magnitude certain macrophytes might improve the removal effect of ecological ditch system by internalization or intercepting müller et al 2001 vymazal 2005 it was verified that tofieldia myriophyllum water hyacinth canna cress had higher removal rates of e coli than other plants in this catchment chen et al in review this research demonstrated the necessity of instrumenting integrated waste water treatment in rural areas in this type of hilly agricultural catchment with dense population 5 conclusions this study demonstrated comprehensively the microbial pollution by investigating tc and e coli with intensive temporal and spatial sampling strategies in a subtropical agricultural catchment in hilly area of upper reach of yangtze river bacteriological quality frequently exceeded water quality guidelines in groundwater and surface water in this catchment showing a high temporal and spatial variability during the observation period the flood season rainy season showed higher risk of microbial contamination compared to non flood season the possible linkages between source area and targets e g groundwater and catchment outlet were ascertained through both surface and subsurface pathways especially linking to residential areas e coli and tc were positively correlated with ec and turbidity indicating that mixture of organic colloids and sediment is the most important transport vector of bacteria in this catchment and turbidity should be an important indicator of microbial pollution in aquatic environment in this region the ecological ditch showed distinct removing effects around two orders of magnitude the current research merits to appropriate sampling design when investigating microbial pollution and benefits to prediction of microbial pollution and adoption of optimized environmental management in the similar agricultural catchments in upper yangtze river acknowledgements this study

11552,while growing populations and increasing water requirements are a certainty there is a big uncertainty about how these requirements will be affected by human activities given the importance of integrated management as a tool for optimum management of water resources by farmers under water deficit conditions the general objective of the present study was to identify factors underpinning integrated management of agricultural water by paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran for this purpose a survey of paddy farmers was conducted the irrigation canals were the most widely used source of water in local paddy farms 44 0 followed by rivers 28 1 the majority of the paddy farmers 70 6 were using more than one water resource for irrigating their fields the farmers believed that post rice succession planting cropping pattern and land use change and fuel subsidy were the most important factors affecting integrated management of agricultural water using exploratory factor analysis five factors affecting integrated management of agricultural water among paddy farmers were revealed i availability of irrigation infrastructure ii cropping pattern iii supportive role of local institutes iv irrigation experience and v traditional beliefs these factors together captured 60 1 of the total variance in the management of agricultural water according to cluster analysis and factors identified by factor analysis paddy farmers using integrated water resources were classified in three clusters i modernists 37 1 who showed the strongest motivation response to changes and they generally showed a high reaction to most motivational factors ii conservatives 34 7 who tended to resist the change and were more satisfied with the current conditions and iii holists 28 2 who showed a favorable response to motivational factors but they were not pioneers the findings provide a better understanding of paddy farmers drivers for integrated management of agricultural water that could assist policy makers to focus on strategies for improving irrigation water productivity and supporting more sustainable water use in rice production in the study area and similar arid cropping regions of the world keywords rice water resources cropping pattern post rice succession planting 1 introduction water is a shared resource with multiple functions uses and merits ballester and mott lacroix 2016 today this resource confronts serious environmental economic social and political challenges in the middle east shevah 2013 in this context experts express their concern that the exploitation of water resources in iran without caring for their limitations would pose grave problems for the country madani 2014 charkhestani et al 2016 the limitations of water resources in iran along with their overexploitation especially in rice farms have revealed the pressing need for improving the use efficiency of this precious input in rice farms darijani et al 2012 water productivity deals with the role of each water unit in the gross domestic product if water use is seen from this perspective then the efficiency of water use in its productivity is very low in iran alizadeh 2001 under these conditions the biggest challenge to the agricultural sector lies in improving water productivity and water use efficiency cai et al 2011 in iran water has a very heterogeneous spatial distribution due to natural climatic conditions and resultant temporal distribution of rainfall the amount of precipitation varies across years and even seasons posing problems to different sectors including the agricultural sector and the supply of drinking water in urban areas in recent years causing substantial economic losses to these sectors the province of guilan possesses about 7 7 of the renewable water of iran the amount of renewable water is around 10 billion m3 and the total water demand of rice farms is around 3 billion m3 in guilan province although the total surface water inflow to the province constitutes about 30 of the total water input this amount of water by itself supplies about 72 of the current water requirements of rice farms guilan irrigation and drainage network exploitation firm 2011 however the construction of multiple dams on the branches of sefid rud river has affected the quantity and quality of irrigation water available to most rice farms in guilan province so that if methods e g water productivity improvement are not adopted not only will the economy of guilan confront serious challenges but also one of the main producing regions of this strategic crop in iran will be jeopardized nearly 171 000 ha of guilan rice farms are covered by an irrigation network of sefid rud river and 66 903 ha are irrigated traditionally by permanent or seasonal streams barrages springs and wells the total water requirement of rice farms in guilan is estimated at 3 billion m3 per year guilan irrigation and drainage network exploitation firm 2013 given the direct employment of over 300 000 users in the rice farming sector and its gross production of over 42 000 billion irr iranian rial it can be said that guilan economy is based on rice production jahad e agriculture organization 2013 therefore it is imperative to pay attention to the sound management of water resource exploitations the groundwater recharge the retention of the surface waters and the improved management of water use and its productivity enhancement integrated management of water resources can be the least but a serious step in some parts the overexploitation of water resources has increased the risk of degradation overall the use of water by the agricultural sector is not optimum in iran langarud county of guilan province is not an exception even though the economics and subsistence of this county are based on agriculture the main approach to cope with these issues is to reduce use and adopt water conservation measures in the agricultural sector one strategy is to adhere to integrated management of agricultural water resources integrated exploitation of surface and ground water resources is a step towards sustainable use of water resources hu et al 2014 while the theoretical knowledge of optimal rice cultivation methods has increased the understanding of farmers attitudes towards water management in rice remains poor however a given policy is likely to elicit a range of responses among individual farmers maybery et al 2005 farmers are key stakeholders in the use of water for irrigation but their position at the end of the water chain means that they are often marginalized in water resource decision making processes huibers and van lier 2005 from this point of view an understanding of the heterogeneity of farmers may shed a light on particular policy options whereas a failure to appreciate the range and complexity of behavioural drivers among farmers may lead to a failure of water management policies yazdanpanah et al 2014 to date there is very limited literature available concerning factors underpinning integrated management of agricultural water by paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran thus given the importance of integrated management of agricultural water resources by paddy growers in langarud county guilan province the objective of the present study was to identify factors underpinning integrated management of agricultural water among local paddy farmers findings would be useful to policy makers in designing strategies for enhancing water productivity of irrigation in rice while reducing potential groundwater depletion in the study region and similar arid production regions in the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran with an area of 438 km2 langarud county is located to the east of guilan province limited by the caspian sea from the north the county has a plain and a mountainous part located to the south the slopes of this part are covered with forests up to the altitude of about 1 300 m where the sea humidity can reach but it is covered with natural pastures in higher altitudes with no trees due to low temperatures and humidity out of 9 100 ha of paddy farms in langarud 7 600 ha are irrigated with a modern integrated system and 1 500 ha by a traditional system in which 700 ha are fed from the shelmanrud and barkely rivers in otaqvar district and 800 ha from pools wells and small streams in kumeleh district 2 2 sampling strategy the statistical population of this study composed of all paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran this county is composed of three districts markazi kumeleh and otaqvar and eight dehestan village groups the respondents were selected by multistage cluster sampling using the table of krejcie and morgan 1970 and considering the least sample size for factor analysis then 360 questionnaires were administered to the paddy farmers of langarud county in proportion to the population share of each district considering a margin of error 3 and alpha 5 finally 347 filled out questionnaires were received and included in the data analysis 2 3 data collection data about integrated management of agricultural water resources were collected by a questionnaire composed of some closed ended questions the section concerning factors underpinning the integrated management of water resources composed of 27 items the respondents were asked to show the extent of their agreement about each item on a five point likert type scale very high to very low in addition the questionnaire had some demographic variables including age gender education family size number of members active in paddy production experience in agriculture total farm area paddy farm area number of farm lots type of paddy farm ownership agricultural activities other than rice farming and type of irrigation resource content and face validity of the questionnaire were assessed to ensure content and face validity the remarks made by professors of the agricultural management department of islamic azad university of rasht experts of the rice research institute of iran and experts of the jahad e agriculture organization of guilan province were applied to the questionnaire the reliability was estimated by cronbach s alpha at 0 916 showing a high reliability of the questionnaire the type of irrigation water resources was used as a grouping variable and the respondents were asked to check the type of resource they used among irrigation canal network river spring well and pool pond the respondents were allowed to check more than one choice then they were included in our analysis as paddy farmers using integrated irrigation resources 2 4 data analysis descriptive statistics frequency distributions means and standard deviations were calculated also the variables for which the respondents could check more than one choice were included in multiple response analysis the variables influencing integrated management of agricultural irrigation resources were summarized in a few factors by exploratory factor analysis bartlett and kmo tests were applied to test data adequacy and appropriateness also anti image matrix was applied to select the variables to be included in the analysis all variables were found to have values 0 5 in the diagonal of anti image matrix so they were all included in the analysis the eigenvalues of 1 was used to select the factors the varimax method was used for the rotation of the factors and the factor load values of 0 4 were considered as the criterion for loading each variable in the factor the k means clustering analysis was used to group the paddy growers in terms of factors generated in factor analysis according to their opinions and viewpoints about integrated management of agricultural water resources accordingly data were categorized into clusters so that each cluster is composed of uniform similar data with the greatest differences among the clusters according to the k means method the prerequisite to form the clusters is that the clusters are a partition of the population or sample coakes 2012 the k means method can be briefly described as follows suppose a set of observations x1 x2 xn each observation is a d dimensional real vector the k means clustering aims to partition n observations into k sets k n according to eq 1 where s s1 s2 sk so that within cluster sum of squares is minimized 1 arg min s i 1 k x s i x μ i 2 where μi shows the mean of points in si clustering was carried out at the convergence level of 0 01 and maximally 10 repetitions using spss18 statistical package in the cluster analysis only farmers who used more than one water sources for irrigation i e 245 out of 347 farmers were considered an anova was conducted as a part of the cluster analysis to see if there were significant differences between clusters or not in contrast to other kinds of clustering the k means outputs provide us with an anova of the cluster centers the anova in cluster analysis has a different meaning namely i variables with large mean square errors provide the least help in differentiating between clusters and ii the differences between the f ratios make it possible to draw general conclusions about the role of the different mean variables in the forming of the clusters finally the anova f tests for each variable indicate how well the variable discriminates between clusters with high values indicating the greatest influence in the forming of the clusters and low values indicating the least influence 3 results 3 1 farmers socio demographic profile the majority of the farmers 88 2 were male table 1 the age group of 50 59 years had the highest frequency of 29 7 and the age group of 29 years had the lowest frequency of 3 7 most respondents 49 9 had a family size of 3 5 individuals but families with less than 3 members active in paddy growing had the highest frequency of 91 9 the number of members participating in paddy growing 3 people differed with other groups the largest group of respondents were graduates of intermediate and high schools the surveyed farmers were active in farming for over 20 years farmers with over 20 years of farming experience were using rivers for irrigation 49 3 the farm area of 65 4 of the paddy farmers was less than one ha table 2 those owning farms with area of less than one ha tended to use rivers 42 7 and irrigation canals 32 6 most paddy farms composed of a single lot and 26 8 of the paddy growers had more than two lots most farmers 78 2 were land owners and only 4 1 used share cropping the most frequently used resources by land owners for irrigation were found to be rivers 52 6 irrigation canals 35 2 and wells 33 4 results for non farming activities revealed that 52 4 of the paddy farmers were not employed in non farming fields but 19 6 were active in horticultural activities and 15 0 in silk farming table 3 3 2 use of water resources farmers frequency distribution in terms of water resources use is summarized in table 4 the irrigation canals were the most widely used source of water for local paddy farms 44 0 followed by rivers 28 1 pools ponds 23 8 wells 2 4 and springs 1 6 overall 29 4 of paddy farmers exploited just one water resource for irrigating their farms whereas the rest 70 6 use more than one source table 5 it should be noted however that there is no exact time of the use of additional resources for irrigation nor information about specific amount of water from the different sources indicating that management optimization of these resources is so important among factors influencing integrated management of agricultural water resources post rice succession planting m 3 34 sd 1 276 was picked up as the most important factor by paddy farmers the next ranks were given to cropping pattern and land use change m 3 13 sd 1 222 and fuel subsidy m 3 00 sd 1 369 on the other hand farm equipping and renewal m 2 15 sd 1 353 was found to be perceived as the least important factor in resource management by respondents who claimed using more than two irrigation resources table 6 3 3 factors affecting integrated agricultural water management factors affecting integrated agricultural water management were determined by exploratory factor analysis using principal component analysis pca the independent factors were derived by varimax factor rotation the kmo value was found to be 0 899 implying the appropriateness of the data for factor analysis bartlett s statistic was significant at the 1 error level showing the significance of variables correlation matrix for pca χ2 2628 42 p 0 001 also the variables correlation matrix was examined before the analysis as a part of the exploratory factor analysis and the variables whose coefficient of correlation with other variables was less than 0 3 were removed from the final analysis field 2009 accordingly three variables having a second job other than farming paddy farmers satisfaction with the existing water resources and following traditional irrigation practices were excluded from the analysis considering eigenvalues 1 five factors were identified as constructs affecting integrated agricultural water management these five factors accounted for 60 1 of the total variance of the variables table 6 shows eigenvalues percent variance captured by the factor and factor loads of each variable after factor rotation a variable would be loaded on a factor if its factor load was 0 4 the first factor was the result of loading eight variables and captured 18 45 of total variance table 6 taking into account the content of the variables this factor was named irrigation infrastructure and included farm equipping and renewal existence of pumping stations availability of cement canals and water structures participation of users or a workgroup in irrigation projects timely allocation of governmental grants for the construction and rehabilitation of water structures water rotation plan by public organizations rice transplanting date and rice yield loss table 6 the second factor composed of six variables cropping pattern and land use change planting of high yielding cultivars post rice succession planting use of drought resistant rice cultivars irrigation by rotation and farm location as the second most important factor underpinning integrated management of agricultural water the factor had an eigenvalue of 3 22 and accounted for 13 42 of the total variance it was called cropping pattern according to the content of the loaded variables the third most important factor affecting integrated management of agricultural water came to be called supportive role of local institutes and captured 11 01 of the total variance it resulted from the aggregation of the variables of decision makings by village councils decision makings by dehyaris the heads of dehestan extension education courses and fuel subsidy reflecting the supportive role of local institutes in decisions made by paddy growers for the management of agricultural resources the fourth factor had an eigenvalue of 2 51 and captured 10 49 of the total variance it was named experience in irrigation considering the loaded variables like skill and experience of farmers and water allocators quality of irrigation water farmers caring of irrigation rotation and planting density number of plants per unit area planting of local rice cultivars in guilan province and water price together formed the fifth factor came to be known as traditional beliefs this factor captured 6 72 of the total variance in integrated management of agricultural water 3 4 clustering farmers according to integrated management of agricultural water to discover the best clustering of farmers the analysis of variance anova for mean comparison of clusters was used accordingly three clusters fell to an acceptable significance level p 0 001 the significance was lower than 0 05 for all groups table 7 therefore clustering had suitable precision and confidence level three clusters were picked up since p 0 01 for the confidence level for all attributes in table 7 the hypothesis of equality of the means of groups clusters was rejected in other words this implies that the means of clusters differed considerably proving the correct procedure applied for clustering the final center and the description of each cluster were used to identify the attributes of each cluster table 8 also all members of the clusters were specified according to this table given the collected data and cluster analysis all paddy farmers were divided into three groups conservatives modernists and holists in terms of factors influencing integrated management of agricultural water it was revealed that most paddy farmers 37 1 were in the cluster of modernists conservatives 34 7 were more inclined towards lower levels of motivations affecting integrated management of agricultural water holists 28 2 showed a favorable response to motivational factors but they tended to consider rather higher levels of motivations affecting integrated management of agricultural water than conservatives i e they were not pioneers 4 discussion the present study attempted to identify effective factors motivating paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran in the adoption of integrated management of agricultural water and classify farmers based on factors influencing integrated use of water resources up to date there is limited literature available concerning factors underpinning integrated management of agricultural water by paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran therefore the study provides novel and important information regarding integrated management of agricultural water resources in langarud guilan province understanding farmers motivations for the adoption of specific water resources for field irrigation and attitudes regarding water use are key starting points to consider when designing measures for managing water resources in agricultural fields accordingly this information could assist policy makers to focus on strategies for improving irrigation water productivity and supporting sustainable water use in rice production in the study area and similar arid cropping regions of the world the irrigation canals were the main source of water for local paddy farms 44 0 followed by rivers 28 1 at the initial design of sefid rud irrigation network continuous irrigation was considered meaning that the canals had adequate capability for allocation of irrigation water simultaneously to all plots however an intermittent irrigation program was launched after a while due to shortage of agricultural water in this intermittent irrigation program in langarud county in the recent years there were three days for irrigation in a 10 days period and afterwards this program was repeated for the next 10 days this is feasible for rice the main crop in the area given that rice does not need to be continuously flooded in all steps of growing concerning the water price it is determined every year by a committee based on the percentage of rice performance e g at the current year based on 5 of the value of rice production h in recent years the price was between 2 700 000 irr h for integrated networks and 3 700 000 irr h for modern networks 1 32 000 irr consequently to amend the shortage of water integrated water management using canals rivers pools ponds wells and springs could be a crucial temporal approach however there is no exact time of utilization of additional resources for irrigation nor information for specific amount of water from the different sources indicating that management optimization of these resources is essential in this regard we could try to minimize the usage of rivers and canals and promote the rational usage of other resources the majority of the farms in the area are covered by irrigation canals and after sefid rud irrigation network the main irrigation resources are rivers and pools in this region wells and springs in the category of groundwater resources were exploited to a much lesser extent this implies that local irrigation resources are among sustainable and renewable resources furthermore given that the irrigation system is an integration of sustainable and renewable resources if the use of resources is not changed they can keep their sustainability nevertheless this is due to the strict regulation of the agriculture organization and also because drilling a well is expensive the fact that over 80 of the farmers were older than 40 years reflects that youths dislike agriculture seemingly youths are not interested to work in the field of agriculture and thus they were found much less experienced therefore the present managerial practices may be changed in future towards easier practices e g the development of an irrigation canal network given that nearly 40 of the farmers own lands smaller than one ha in the area and just a few members of the families participate in farming there is a need for revision in farming management practices availability of irrigation infrastructure was the most important motive for integrated use of agricultural water resources the erratic precipitation pattern and the availability of multiple local water resources e g rivers wells springs canals pools and barrages has turned the availability of infrastructure for the transfer of water to farms into the most important factor affecting the integrated use of the resources therefore the availability of pumping stations the timely allocation of governmental grants to the construction and rehabilitation of projects the availability of cement canals and water structures the water rotation plan by public organizations and even the equipping and renewal of paddy farms along with reinforcement of social capitals i e the participation of users or a workgroup in irrigation were regarded as essential motivational factors influencing the integrated management of water resources these findings are consistent with those of other studies that reported about the need for considering technical issues in agricultural water management such as different irrigation systems and modernization of farmlands rezadoost and allahyari 2014 many of the world s irrigated regions face the problem of aging infrastructure and declining revenues to maintain and repair irrigation structures raising the urgency to invest in irrigation infrastructure ward 2010 therefore one of the best modern approaches to ensure sustainable use and management of water resources is to increase the efficiency of water infrastructure which can play a central role in pursuing sustainable development accordingly this approach for water infrastructure could be supplementary to the traditional approaches mainly aimed at water supply management e g construction of water infrastructure such as dams hydropower plants canals pumping stations etc cropping pattern was the second important motivation for the integrated management of agricultural water cropping pattern has been reported to improve water use and yield performance of winter wheat zhang et al 2007 similar to the first factor cropping pattern affirms modernism in planting management and therefore practices that indicate modernism might have a high motivational impact on farmers the next factor the supportive role of local institutes implies the effectiveness of knowledge in decision making this factor reflects the theoretical part of management i e knowledge and skills in the implementation of integrated irrigation management practices according to this factor it can be said that the inclusion of theoretical input in local farming management can motivate farmers the importance of farmers training in improving agricultural water management has been previously pointed out tahamipour et al 2005 rezadoost and allahyari 2014 implying that farmers need to learn modern methods of optimum water use a suitable cultivation model and appropriate irrigation systems experience and traditional beliefs can be motivational too for example experience has been reported to affect the optimum agricultural water management rezadoost and allahyari 2014 however results show that farmers are more inclined to modernism and need facing the evolutions to sustain their motives for the use of different practices of integrated management of irrigation water according to the irrigation practices reported in this study the introduction of irrigation canals and pumping stations that supply about 80 of water requirement of the farms can lead nearly 70 of the farmers towards the integrated use of irrigation resources therefore it seems that the introduction of technology both in theoretical and technical i e infrastructure aspects can empower the approaches of integrated water resource management to match the existing conditions and cope with future water deficit problems 5 conclusions this study analyzed factors motivating paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran in the adoption of integrated management of agricultural water and identified critical aspects to consider in future design of constructed water management measures to ensure a high adoption rate of the measures addressing the complex issue of water shortage in rural communities requires a comprehensive understanding of biophysical socioeconomic and institutional settings which is only possible by using a combination of diverse qualitative and quantitative research methods therefore this approach becomes even more relevant when data are limited and issues are complex the findings provide a better understanding of paddy farmers drivers for integrated management of agricultural water that could assist policy makers to focus on strategies for improving irrigation water productivity and supporting more sustainable water use in rice production in the area and other arid cropping regions of the world effective management of water resources is a critical policy issue in arid areas with a better understanding of the coupled social and ecological systems there is an increasing appreciation of the role of community based organizations in the management of water resources nevertheless increased focus is needed on creating institutional space for small scale farmers and local officials particularly township and village officials to explore options for improved water resource management and livelihood adaptation based on local conditions thus a collaborative effort between those groups of stakeholders should be pursued this will ensure a smooth and efficient flow of information thereby improving the implementation of measures and increasing the likelihood of achieving the water quality target whereas the regulatory measures may remain in place designing tailor made incentives based on farm structure and physical characteristics would greatly improve the pace of adoption of technologies thereby reducing water pollution substantially accordingly to gain support from farmers and farm communities rebuilding farmers water use associations and promoting the development of community based water management system should remain a priority of the integrated

11552,while growing populations and increasing water requirements are a certainty there is a big uncertainty about how these requirements will be affected by human activities given the importance of integrated management as a tool for optimum management of water resources by farmers under water deficit conditions the general objective of the present study was to identify factors underpinning integrated management of agricultural water by paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran for this purpose a survey of paddy farmers was conducted the irrigation canals were the most widely used source of water in local paddy farms 44 0 followed by rivers 28 1 the majority of the paddy farmers 70 6 were using more than one water resource for irrigating their fields the farmers believed that post rice succession planting cropping pattern and land use change and fuel subsidy were the most important factors affecting integrated management of agricultural water using exploratory factor analysis five factors affecting integrated management of agricultural water among paddy farmers were revealed i availability of irrigation infrastructure ii cropping pattern iii supportive role of local institutes iv irrigation experience and v traditional beliefs these factors together captured 60 1 of the total variance in the management of agricultural water according to cluster analysis and factors identified by factor analysis paddy farmers using integrated water resources were classified in three clusters i modernists 37 1 who showed the strongest motivation response to changes and they generally showed a high reaction to most motivational factors ii conservatives 34 7 who tended to resist the change and were more satisfied with the current conditions and iii holists 28 2 who showed a favorable response to motivational factors but they were not pioneers the findings provide a better understanding of paddy farmers drivers for integrated management of agricultural water that could assist policy makers to focus on strategies for improving irrigation water productivity and supporting more sustainable water use in rice production in the study area and similar arid cropping regions of the world keywords rice water resources cropping pattern post rice succession planting 1 introduction water is a shared resource with multiple functions uses and merits ballester and mott lacroix 2016 today this resource confronts serious environmental economic social and political challenges in the middle east shevah 2013 in this context experts express their concern that the exploitation of water resources in iran without caring for their limitations would pose grave problems for the country madani 2014 charkhestani et al 2016 the limitations of water resources in iran along with their overexploitation especially in rice farms have revealed the pressing need for improving the use efficiency of this precious input in rice farms darijani et al 2012 water productivity deals with the role of each water unit in the gross domestic product if water use is seen from this perspective then the efficiency of water use in its productivity is very low in iran alizadeh 2001 under these conditions the biggest challenge to the agricultural sector lies in improving water productivity and water use efficiency cai et al 2011 in iran water has a very heterogeneous spatial distribution due to natural climatic conditions and resultant temporal distribution of rainfall the amount of precipitation varies across years and even seasons posing problems to different sectors including the agricultural sector and the supply of drinking water in urban areas in recent years causing substantial economic losses to these sectors the province of guilan possesses about 7 7 of the renewable water of iran the amount of renewable water is around 10 billion m3 and the total water demand of rice farms is around 3 billion m3 in guilan province although the total surface water inflow to the province constitutes about 30 of the total water input this amount of water by itself supplies about 72 of the current water requirements of rice farms guilan irrigation and drainage network exploitation firm 2011 however the construction of multiple dams on the branches of sefid rud river has affected the quantity and quality of irrigation water available to most rice farms in guilan province so that if methods e g water productivity improvement are not adopted not only will the economy of guilan confront serious challenges but also one of the main producing regions of this strategic crop in iran will be jeopardized nearly 171 000 ha of guilan rice farms are covered by an irrigation network of sefid rud river and 66 903 ha are irrigated traditionally by permanent or seasonal streams barrages springs and wells the total water requirement of rice farms in guilan is estimated at 3 billion m3 per year guilan irrigation and drainage network exploitation firm 2013 given the direct employment of over 300 000 users in the rice farming sector and its gross production of over 42 000 billion irr iranian rial it can be said that guilan economy is based on rice production jahad e agriculture organization 2013 therefore it is imperative to pay attention to the sound management of water resource exploitations the groundwater recharge the retention of the surface waters and the improved management of water use and its productivity enhancement integrated management of water resources can be the least but a serious step in some parts the overexploitation of water resources has increased the risk of degradation overall the use of water by the agricultural sector is not optimum in iran langarud county of guilan province is not an exception even though the economics and subsistence of this county are based on agriculture the main approach to cope with these issues is to reduce use and adopt water conservation measures in the agricultural sector one strategy is to adhere to integrated management of agricultural water resources integrated exploitation of surface and ground water resources is a step towards sustainable use of water resources hu et al 2014 while the theoretical knowledge of optimal rice cultivation methods has increased the understanding of farmers attitudes towards water management in rice remains poor however a given policy is likely to elicit a range of responses among individual farmers maybery et al 2005 farmers are key stakeholders in the use of water for irrigation but their position at the end of the water chain means that they are often marginalized in water resource decision making processes huibers and van lier 2005 from this point of view an understanding of the heterogeneity of farmers may shed a light on particular policy options whereas a failure to appreciate the range and complexity of behavioural drivers among farmers may lead to a failure of water management policies yazdanpanah et al 2014 to date there is very limited literature available concerning factors underpinning integrated management of agricultural water by paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran thus given the importance of integrated management of agricultural water resources by paddy growers in langarud county guilan province the objective of the present study was to identify factors underpinning integrated management of agricultural water among local paddy farmers findings would be useful to policy makers in designing strategies for enhancing water productivity of irrigation in rice while reducing potential groundwater depletion in the study region and similar arid production regions in the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran with an area of 438 km2 langarud county is located to the east of guilan province limited by the caspian sea from the north the county has a plain and a mountainous part located to the south the slopes of this part are covered with forests up to the altitude of about 1 300 m where the sea humidity can reach but it is covered with natural pastures in higher altitudes with no trees due to low temperatures and humidity out of 9 100 ha of paddy farms in langarud 7 600 ha are irrigated with a modern integrated system and 1 500 ha by a traditional system in which 700 ha are fed from the shelmanrud and barkely rivers in otaqvar district and 800 ha from pools wells and small streams in kumeleh district 2 2 sampling strategy the statistical population of this study composed of all paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran this county is composed of three districts markazi kumeleh and otaqvar and eight dehestan village groups the respondents were selected by multistage cluster sampling using the table of krejcie and morgan 1970 and considering the least sample size for factor analysis then 360 questionnaires were administered to the paddy farmers of langarud county in proportion to the population share of each district considering a margin of error 3 and alpha 5 finally 347 filled out questionnaires were received and included in the data analysis 2 3 data collection data about integrated management of agricultural water resources were collected by a questionnaire composed of some closed ended questions the section concerning factors underpinning the integrated management of water resources composed of 27 items the respondents were asked to show the extent of their agreement about each item on a five point likert type scale very high to very low in addition the questionnaire had some demographic variables including age gender education family size number of members active in paddy production experience in agriculture total farm area paddy farm area number of farm lots type of paddy farm ownership agricultural activities other than rice farming and type of irrigation resource content and face validity of the questionnaire were assessed to ensure content and face validity the remarks made by professors of the agricultural management department of islamic azad university of rasht experts of the rice research institute of iran and experts of the jahad e agriculture organization of guilan province were applied to the questionnaire the reliability was estimated by cronbach s alpha at 0 916 showing a high reliability of the questionnaire the type of irrigation water resources was used as a grouping variable and the respondents were asked to check the type of resource they used among irrigation canal network river spring well and pool pond the respondents were allowed to check more than one choice then they were included in our analysis as paddy farmers using integrated irrigation resources 2 4 data analysis descriptive statistics frequency distributions means and standard deviations were calculated also the variables for which the respondents could check more than one choice were included in multiple response analysis the variables influencing integrated management of agricultural irrigation resources were summarized in a few factors by exploratory factor analysis bartlett and kmo tests were applied to test data adequacy and appropriateness also anti image matrix was applied to select the variables to be included in the analysis all variables were found to have values 0 5 in the diagonal of anti image matrix so they were all included in the analysis the eigenvalues of 1 was used to select the factors the varimax method was used for the rotation of the factors and the factor load values of 0 4 were considered as the criterion for loading each variable in the factor the k means clustering analysis was used to group the paddy growers in terms of factors generated in factor analysis according to their opinions and viewpoints about integrated management of agricultural water resources accordingly data were categorized into clusters so that each cluster is composed of uniform similar data with the greatest differences among the clusters according to the k means method the prerequisite to form the clusters is that the clusters are a partition of the population or sample coakes 2012 the k means method can be briefly described as follows suppose a set of observations x1 x2 xn each observation is a d dimensional real vector the k means clustering aims to partition n observations into k sets k n according to eq 1 where s s1 s2 sk so that within cluster sum of squares is minimized 1 arg min s i 1 k x s i x μ i 2 where μi shows the mean of points in si clustering was carried out at the convergence level of 0 01 and maximally 10 repetitions using spss18 statistical package in the cluster analysis only farmers who used more than one water sources for irrigation i e 245 out of 347 farmers were considered an anova was conducted as a part of the cluster analysis to see if there were significant differences between clusters or not in contrast to other kinds of clustering the k means outputs provide us with an anova of the cluster centers the anova in cluster analysis has a different meaning namely i variables with large mean square errors provide the least help in differentiating between clusters and ii the differences between the f ratios make it possible to draw general conclusions about the role of the different mean variables in the forming of the clusters finally the anova f tests for each variable indicate how well the variable discriminates between clusters with high values indicating the greatest influence in the forming of the clusters and low values indicating the least influence 3 results 3 1 farmers socio demographic profile the majority of the farmers 88 2 were male table 1 the age group of 50 59 years had the highest frequency of 29 7 and the age group of 29 years had the lowest frequency of 3 7 most respondents 49 9 had a family size of 3 5 individuals but families with less than 3 members active in paddy growing had the highest frequency of 91 9 the number of members participating in paddy growing 3 people differed with other groups the largest group of respondents were graduates of intermediate and high schools the surveyed farmers were active in farming for over 20 years farmers with over 20 years of farming experience were using rivers for irrigation 49 3 the farm area of 65 4 of the paddy farmers was less than one ha table 2 those owning farms with area of less than one ha tended to use rivers 42 7 and irrigation canals 32 6 most paddy farms composed of a single lot and 26 8 of the paddy growers had more than two lots most farmers 78 2 were land owners and only 4 1 used share cropping the most frequently used resources by land owners for irrigation were found to be rivers 52 6 irrigation canals 35 2 and wells 33 4 results for non farming activities revealed that 52 4 of the paddy farmers were not employed in non farming fields but 19 6 were active in horticultural activities and 15 0 in silk farming table 3 3 2 use of water resources farmers frequency distribution in terms of water resources use is summarized in table 4 the irrigation canals were the most widely used source of water for local paddy farms 44 0 followed by rivers 28 1 pools ponds 23 8 wells 2 4 and springs 1 6 overall 29 4 of paddy farmers exploited just one water resource for irrigating their farms whereas the rest 70 6 use more than one source table 5 it should be noted however that there is no exact time of the use of additional resources for irrigation nor information about specific amount of water from the different sources indicating that management optimization of these resources is so important among factors influencing integrated management of agricultural water resources post rice succession planting m 3 34 sd 1 276 was picked up as the most important factor by paddy farmers the next ranks were given to cropping pattern and land use change m 3 13 sd 1 222 and fuel subsidy m 3 00 sd 1 369 on the other hand farm equipping and renewal m 2 15 sd 1 353 was found to be perceived as the least important factor in resource management by respondents who claimed using more than two irrigation resources table 6 3 3 factors affecting integrated agricultural water management factors affecting integrated agricultural water management were determined by exploratory factor analysis using principal component analysis pca the independent factors were derived by varimax factor rotation the kmo value was found to be 0 899 implying the appropriateness of the data for factor analysis bartlett s statistic was significant at the 1 error level showing the significance of variables correlation matrix for pca χ2 2628 42 p 0 001 also the variables correlation matrix was examined before the analysis as a part of the exploratory factor analysis and the variables whose coefficient of correlation with other variables was less than 0 3 were removed from the final analysis field 2009 accordingly three variables having a second job other than farming paddy farmers satisfaction with the existing water resources and following traditional irrigation practices were excluded from the analysis considering eigenvalues 1 five factors were identified as constructs affecting integrated agricultural water management these five factors accounted for 60 1 of the total variance of the variables table 6 shows eigenvalues percent variance captured by the factor and factor loads of each variable after factor rotation a variable would be loaded on a factor if its factor load was 0 4 the first factor was the result of loading eight variables and captured 18 45 of total variance table 6 taking into account the content of the variables this factor was named irrigation infrastructure and included farm equipping and renewal existence of pumping stations availability of cement canals and water structures participation of users or a workgroup in irrigation projects timely allocation of governmental grants for the construction and rehabilitation of water structures water rotation plan by public organizations rice transplanting date and rice yield loss table 6 the second factor composed of six variables cropping pattern and land use change planting of high yielding cultivars post rice succession planting use of drought resistant rice cultivars irrigation by rotation and farm location as the second most important factor underpinning integrated management of agricultural water the factor had an eigenvalue of 3 22 and accounted for 13 42 of the total variance it was called cropping pattern according to the content of the loaded variables the third most important factor affecting integrated management of agricultural water came to be called supportive role of local institutes and captured 11 01 of the total variance it resulted from the aggregation of the variables of decision makings by village councils decision makings by dehyaris the heads of dehestan extension education courses and fuel subsidy reflecting the supportive role of local institutes in decisions made by paddy growers for the management of agricultural resources the fourth factor had an eigenvalue of 2 51 and captured 10 49 of the total variance it was named experience in irrigation considering the loaded variables like skill and experience of farmers and water allocators quality of irrigation water farmers caring of irrigation rotation and planting density number of plants per unit area planting of local rice cultivars in guilan province and water price together formed the fifth factor came to be known as traditional beliefs this factor captured 6 72 of the total variance in integrated management of agricultural water 3 4 clustering farmers according to integrated management of agricultural water to discover the best clustering of farmers the analysis of variance anova for mean comparison of clusters was used accordingly three clusters fell to an acceptable significance level p 0 001 the significance was lower than 0 05 for all groups table 7 therefore clustering had suitable precision and confidence level three clusters were picked up since p 0 01 for the confidence level for all attributes in table 7 the hypothesis of equality of the means of groups clusters was rejected in other words this implies that the means of clusters differed considerably proving the correct procedure applied for clustering the final center and the description of each cluster were used to identify the attributes of each cluster table 8 also all members of the clusters were specified according to this table given the collected data and cluster analysis all paddy farmers were divided into three groups conservatives modernists and holists in terms of factors influencing integrated management of agricultural water it was revealed that most paddy farmers 37 1 were in the cluster of modernists conservatives 34 7 were more inclined towards lower levels of motivations affecting integrated management of agricultural water holists 28 2 showed a favorable response to motivational factors but they tended to consider rather higher levels of motivations affecting integrated management of agricultural water than conservatives i e they were not pioneers 4 discussion the present study attempted to identify effective factors motivating paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran in the adoption of integrated management of agricultural water and classify farmers based on factors influencing integrated use of water resources up to date there is limited literature available concerning factors underpinning integrated management of agricultural water by paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran therefore the study provides novel and important information regarding integrated management of agricultural water resources in langarud guilan province understanding farmers motivations for the adoption of specific water resources for field irrigation and attitudes regarding water use are key starting points to consider when designing measures for managing water resources in agricultural fields accordingly this information could assist policy makers to focus on strategies for improving irrigation water productivity and supporting sustainable water use in rice production in the study area and similar arid cropping regions of the world the irrigation canals were the main source of water for local paddy farms 44 0 followed by rivers 28 1 at the initial design of sefid rud irrigation network continuous irrigation was considered meaning that the canals had adequate capability for allocation of irrigation water simultaneously to all plots however an intermittent irrigation program was launched after a while due to shortage of agricultural water in this intermittent irrigation program in langarud county in the recent years there were three days for irrigation in a 10 days period and afterwards this program was repeated for the next 10 days this is feasible for rice the main crop in the area given that rice does not need to be continuously flooded in all steps of growing concerning the water price it is determined every year by a committee based on the percentage of rice performance e g at the current year based on 5 of the value of rice production h in recent years the price was between 2 700 000 irr h for integrated networks and 3 700 000 irr h for modern networks 1 32 000 irr consequently to amend the shortage of water integrated water management using canals rivers pools ponds wells and springs could be a crucial temporal approach however there is no exact time of utilization of additional resources for irrigation nor information for specific amount of water from the different sources indicating that management optimization of these resources is essential in this regard we could try to minimize the usage of rivers and canals and promote the rational usage of other resources the majority of the farms in the area are covered by irrigation canals and after sefid rud irrigation network the main irrigation resources are rivers and pools in this region wells and springs in the category of groundwater resources were exploited to a much lesser extent this implies that local irrigation resources are among sustainable and renewable resources furthermore given that the irrigation system is an integration of sustainable and renewable resources if the use of resources is not changed they can keep their sustainability nevertheless this is due to the strict regulation of the agriculture organization and also because drilling a well is expensive the fact that over 80 of the farmers were older than 40 years reflects that youths dislike agriculture seemingly youths are not interested to work in the field of agriculture and thus they were found much less experienced therefore the present managerial practices may be changed in future towards easier practices e g the development of an irrigation canal network given that nearly 40 of the farmers own lands smaller than one ha in the area and just a few members of the families participate in farming there is a need for revision in farming management practices availability of irrigation infrastructure was the most important motive for integrated use of agricultural water resources the erratic precipitation pattern and the availability of multiple local water resources e g rivers wells springs canals pools and barrages has turned the availability of infrastructure for the transfer of water to farms into the most important factor affecting the integrated use of the resources therefore the availability of pumping stations the timely allocation of governmental grants to the construction and rehabilitation of projects the availability of cement canals and water structures the water rotation plan by public organizations and even the equipping and renewal of paddy farms along with reinforcement of social capitals i e the participation of users or a workgroup in irrigation were regarded as essential motivational factors influencing the integrated management of water resources these findings are consistent with those of other studies that reported about the need for considering technical issues in agricultural water management such as different irrigation systems and modernization of farmlands rezadoost and allahyari 2014 many of the world s irrigated regions face the problem of aging infrastructure and declining revenues to maintain and repair irrigation structures raising the urgency to invest in irrigation infrastructure ward 2010 therefore one of the best modern approaches to ensure sustainable use and management of water resources is to increase the efficiency of water infrastructure which can play a central role in pursuing sustainable development accordingly this approach for water infrastructure could be supplementary to the traditional approaches mainly aimed at water supply management e g construction of water infrastructure such as dams hydropower plants canals pumping stations etc cropping pattern was the second important motivation for the integrated management of agricultural water cropping pattern has been reported to improve water use and yield performance of winter wheat zhang et al 2007 similar to the first factor cropping pattern affirms modernism in planting management and therefore practices that indicate modernism might have a high motivational impact on farmers the next factor the supportive role of local institutes implies the effectiveness of knowledge in decision making this factor reflects the theoretical part of management i e knowledge and skills in the implementation of integrated irrigation management practices according to this factor it can be said that the inclusion of theoretical input in local farming management can motivate farmers the importance of farmers training in improving agricultural water management has been previously pointed out tahamipour et al 2005 rezadoost and allahyari 2014 implying that farmers need to learn modern methods of optimum water use a suitable cultivation model and appropriate irrigation systems experience and traditional beliefs can be motivational too for example experience has been reported to affect the optimum agricultural water management rezadoost and allahyari 2014 however results show that farmers are more inclined to modernism and need facing the evolutions to sustain their motives for the use of different practices of integrated management of irrigation water according to the irrigation practices reported in this study the introduction of irrigation canals and pumping stations that supply about 80 of water requirement of the farms can lead nearly 70 of the farmers towards the integrated use of irrigation resources therefore it seems that the introduction of technology both in theoretical and technical i e infrastructure aspects can empower the approaches of integrated water resource management to match the existing conditions and cope with future water deficit problems 5 conclusions this study analyzed factors motivating paddy farmers in langarud county of guilan province in northern iran in the adoption of integrated management of agricultural water and identified critical aspects to consider in future design of constructed water management measures to ensure a high adoption rate of the measures addressing the complex issue of water shortage in rural communities requires a comprehensive understanding of biophysical socioeconomic and institutional settings which is only possible by using a combination of diverse qualitative and quantitative research methods therefore this approach becomes even more relevant when data are limited and issues are complex the findings provide a better understanding of paddy farmers drivers for integrated management of agricultural water that could assist policy makers to focus on strategies for improving irrigation water productivity and supporting more sustainable water use in rice production in the area and other arid cropping regions of the world effective management of water resources is a critical policy issue in arid areas with a better understanding of the coupled social and ecological systems there is an increasing appreciation of the role of community based organizations in the management of water resources nevertheless increased focus is needed on creating institutional space for small scale farmers and local officials particularly township and village officials to explore options for improved water resource management and livelihood adaptation based on local conditions thus a collaborative effort between those groups of stakeholders should be pursued this will ensure a smooth and efficient flow of information thereby improving the implementation of measures and increasing the likelihood of achieving the water quality target whereas the regulatory measures may remain in place designing tailor made incentives based on farm structure and physical characteristics would greatly improve the pace of adoption of technologies thereby reducing water pollution substantially accordingly to gain support from farmers and farm communities rebuilding farmers water use associations and promoting the development of community based water management system should remain a priority of the integrated water resource management reform acknowledgments financial support by rasht branch islamic azad university grant no 4 5830 is acknowledged also we would like to thank mr soroush marzban for his

11553,the compensation heat pulse velocity chpv is one of the most widely used methods to measure sap flow in woody plants however the accuracy of this method has not been fully explored especially for indigenous tree species of south africa the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the chpv method in quantifying tree transpiration for selected tree species three indigenous trees sampled in a monolith form black karee sersia lancea buffalo thorn ziziphus mucronata and wild olive olea africana grown on weighing lysimeters 1 m 1 m 1 3 m were installed with chpv probes to measure sap flow on the stem half hourly simultaneously with lysimeter measurements of transpiration the surfaces of the lysimeters were covered with a 10 cm layer of styrofoam overlain by a 2 cm layer of gravel to minimize evaporation to a negligible level both the lysimeter and chpv measurements were divided into two sets the first set was used to develop tree specific calibration equations as well as an equation combining the three species used here called a combination equation the second set of data was used for validating the equations transpiration rates ranged from negligible at night to daily peaks of 3 5 1 7 and 1 4 l h 1 for buffalo thorn black karee and wild olive respectively good agreement indices between chpv and lysimeters were obtained when using both the tree specific equations and combination equation across species d 0 778 1 000 rmse 0 001 0 017 l h 1 mae 0 001 l h 1 and mbe 0 0007 to 0 0008 l h 1 it was concluded that the chpv method can accurately measure tree water use and therefore can be useful for water resources management in forested areas keywords sap flow calibration tree water use indigenous south african trees 1 introduction there are various ways of quantifying transpiration of field crops but for trees sap flow measurement remains the most prominent an array of automated thermodynamic techniques which use heat as a tracer of sap flow have for several decades been employed to quantify water fluxes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum at the tree scale amongst the thermal based methods of sap flow measurement the most common are the compensation heat pulse velocity chpv huber and schmidt 1937 marshall 1958 swanson 1962 swanson and whitfield 1981 fernández et al 2001 green et al 2003 and thermal heat dissipation thd granier 1987 lu et al 2004 methods these methods are user friendly and cause minimal damage to the tree stems granier 1987 green et al 2003 the chpv method also has an advantage of using less energy as it works on pulses of heat as opposed to the continuous heating principle of the thd fernández et al 2006 nourtier et al 2011 the chpv method has also been employed to measure transpiration of local and exotic commercial forest species of south africa such as eucalyptus species morris et al 2004 wildy et al 2004 and jatropha curcas gush 2008 the accuracy of the chpv method in measuring sap flow in indigenous trees of south africa has unfortunately not been explored lysimetry is considered as one of the standard methods to quantify plant water use johnson et al 2005 clawson et al 2009 especially if their load cells are correctly calibrated misra et al 2011 and can account for various components of the soil water balance while keeping other components under control dlamini et al 2016 even though lysimeters can accurately measure plant water use and can be applied in a number of studies such as soil nutrients evaporation and drainage analysis it has its own drawbacks such as high cost and limited replication the indigenous trees in south africa contribute significantly to the economy of the country in the form of goods and services gush et al 2015 however knowledge on the transpiration of most of these indigenous trees is limited dye et al 2008 the objective of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of chpv method in measuring transpiration of selected indigenous tree species of south africa 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the study was conducted at kenilworth experiment farm latitude 29 02 longitude 26 15 and altitude 1354 m in the department of soil crop and climate sciences at the university of the free state in bloemfontein south africa this experiment was implemented over a period of 107 days during the summer season from 9th december 2016 to 25th march 2017 the study area with a mean annual precipitation of 528 mm mostly falling between october and april and average reference evapotranspiration eto of 1 604 mm is classified as warm semi arid thornthwaite 1948 unesco 1979 peel et al 2007 the mean annual minimum and maximum air temperatures are 11 0 c and 25 5 c respectively 2 2 trees and lysimeter facility an illustration of the equipment setup during the experiment is shown in fig 1 three indigenous trees of dominant species within the study area black karee sersia lancea buffalo thorn ziziphus mucronata and wild olive olea africana were transplanted from within a radius of 3 km away from the study area into lysimeters january 2015 with their natural soil monoliths on average the trees were 4 m 2 5 m 5 m in height and stem diameter between 90 and 120 mm the ages of the trees were estimated to be within the range of 7 10 years the dimensions of lysimeters were 1 m 1 m and 1 3 m in depth the lysimeter containers with their contents soil and trees were placed on top of loadtech lt 1300 type of load cells supplied the loadtech load cells pty ltd south africa the load cells were placed on top of flat concrete slabs to ensure they remain level during the experiment the soil surface on top of the monoliths was covered by a 10 cm layer of styrofoam and then overlain by a 2 cm layer of gravel to minimize evaporation to negligible levels 2 3 compensation heat pulse velocity theory in the chpv method two temperature sensors are inserted at unequal distances downstream and upstream of a radially inserted heater in the stem the upstream probe is placed closer to the heater 5 mm and increase temperature faster through conduction than the downstream probe placed 10 mm away whose temperature change is influenced by transfer of energy by conduction through the wood and convection through the flowing sap whenever a heat pulse is released by the heater the time taken by the two sensors to record equal temperature rise is related to the movement of sap flow and hence the plant water uptake swanson and whitfield 1981 green et al 2003 the heat pulse velocity vh in cm h 1 is calculated from the time t taken to record equal temperatures by the sensors at distances xu upstream and xd downstream as 1 v h x u x d 2 t vh is basically indirectly proportional to t this implies that if the sap movement is high the convection of the heat pulse through the moving sap will be enhanced and then the recorded t will be minimal early studies revealed that the movement of the sap is a few folds more than the movement of heat in terms of sap flow density through the sapwood because the heat is also dependent on conduction through the stationary interstitial tissue between the xylem vessels or tracheids marshall 1958 established a relationship between vh and the sap flux q and expressed it as 2 q a u ρ s m c s m ρ s c s v h where a is the fraction of the cross sectional area of the conducting sapwood occupied by moving sap u is the velocity of sap ρ and care density and specific heat capacity with subscripts s and sm referring to the sap and sap plus woody matrix respectively v h can be expressed in terms of the basic density ρ b and the water content w c of the sapwood as estimated as 3 ρ b oven dried mass of wood fresh volume of wood 4 w c fresh mass of wood oven dried mass of wood oven dried mass of wood the density ρ of the fresh wood can also be expressed 5 ρ ρ b 1 w c the specific heat c can be expressed as 6 c c w w c c s 1 w c where c w specific heat of oven dry wood 0 33c s specific heat of sap water 1 0s density of sap 1 0 eq 2 on substitution then becomes 7 q ρ b w c 0 33 v h sap flux estimated using eq 7 can be referred to as raw values of sap velocity as the procedure that was used to obtain this equation assumed the sapwood material to be isotropic marshall 1958 something which is not a true reflection of reality the velocity of sap varies with radial depth into the stem before the application of eq 7 to establish the flux density of sap the measured values of v h must be corrected to account for i the influence on heat transfer of the material used to construct the heater and sensor probes and ii the effects of the wounding due to drills into the wood empirical functions to make these corrections for a variety of materials used to construct heaters and sensors and for a range of drill spacing were derived by swanson and whitfield 1981 green and clothier 1988 and green et al 2003 to establish the volumetric flow rates q v the sap flux is measured at different depths below the cambium of a stem in order to determine a radial profile of sap flux across the sapwood a second order least squares regression

of the stem and h is the heartwood radius 2 4 tree water use measurements water use by the trees was monitored using the prior calibrated load cells and the chpv technique changes in mass indicating water gain or loss in each of the lysimeters was obtained from the outputs of the load cells which were all connected to a datalogger cr 3000 campell scientific inc logan ut usa the signals from the load cells were sampled every minute and the average stored half hourly the change in mass recorded by the load cell was converted into transpiration t in l h 1 as follows 9 t 2 x 1 x 2 where x 1is the initial mass at the beginning of half an hour and x 2 is the final mass at the end every half an hour alongside the load cell measurements tree water uptake was monitored using the chpv technique installed on the stems at approximately 0 5 m above the soil surface to make provision for the bias due to the variation in azimuthal variability of the sap flow density during the day or season wullschleger and king 2000 saveyn et al 2008 two sets of the chpv technique were installed on an individual tree in a spiral pattern around the tree stem for each set the two temperature sensor probes installed upstream and downstream of the heater had thermistors at depths of 5 15 25 and 40 mm below the cambium in this way assessment of radial profile and its temporal variability for individual tree were made possible sap flow data were recorded and stored in a datalogger cr1000 campell scientific inc logan ut usa the sap flow gadgets were covered by aluminium foil to minimize external environmental effects on the sensors these measurements were taken across a range of soil water content from near saturation to at least 30 of available water aw in the top 80 cm aw is the difference between the predetermined drained upper limit and drained lower limit of the soil as explained by hensley et al 2011 the soil water content was always brought back to field capacity whenever aw approaches 30 part of the irrigation aim for the study was to ensure that the trees did not go into stress throughout the year hydrascout capacitance probes hscp manufactured by hydra sensor technologies international ltd in south africa was used to monitor the soil water content throughout the experiment prior to the beginning of the study hscp probes were calibrated in the laboratory and in the field against the standard gravimetric method for soil water measurements across the depth of each soil profile in all the points where trees were sampled the accuracy of the chpv method to estimate water use by the selected indigenous trees was tested against the lysimeter measurements 2 5 statistical analysis tree water use data measured by both the lysimeter and chpv techniques were divided into two sets the first set of data was used to generate the calibration equations by regressing the lysimeter transpiration data against the chpv data for the three trees the calibration data from the three lysimeter units were also pooled together to form a relationship referred to as the combination equation an equation combining data of the three tree species the four equations three tree specific and combination were evaluated by applying them on the chpv data from the second data set to estimate the corresponding lysimeter data for a particular time to test the versatility of the equations across tree species each of the four equations was applied in all the three tree species the goodness of fit for the predicted transpiration values against the lysimeter measurements was determined by the coefficient of determination r2 and d index of agreement d eq 10 the accuracy of estimation was determined by the root mean square error rmse eq 11 and mean absolute error mae eq 12 the mean bias error mbe eq 13 was computed to determine the deviation of the predicted tree transpiration from the lysimeter measured transpiration willmott 1982 walther and moore 2005 10 d 1 i 1 n e

transpiration observed or measured lysimeter transpiration and mean values for the lysimeter measurements respectively any model with r2 approaching 1 has a good performance a d index close to 1 as well as rmse and mae close to 0 indicates good agreement between measured and estimated values willmott 1982 a negative mbe indicates that the sap flow measurement is underestimating the lysimeter measured transpiration and vice versa the closer the mbe value is to 0 the better abbas et al 2011 3 results 3 1 calibration equations after the tree transpiration measured by lysimeter and sap flow meter has been converted to the same unit l h 1 it can be observed that different ranges of transpiration were observed for different tree species fig 2 out of the 3 tree species the maximum transpiration was observed in buffalo thorn which was above 3 5 l h 1 from lysimeter measurement transpiration rates of up to 1 7 l h 1 and 1 4 l h 1 were observed for black karee and wild olive respectively the relationships between the lysimeter transpiration and sap flow measurements on the different trees individually and across tree species is presented in fig 2 based on the highest r2 these relationships were described by linear equations the r2 values were 0 65 for black karee 0 75 for buffalo thorn 0 62 for wild olive and 0 69 for the combination calibration 3 2 validation of the calibration equations the application of all the tree specific and combination calibration equations on the second set of data for each of the three tree species to estimate transpiration using the sap flow data is presented in fig 3 a l the summary of statistical performance of the developed equations is presented in table 1 the observed rmse values were all small 0 001 0 017 l h 1 for the tree specific calibration equations and the combination equation across the trees the r2 values that ranged between 0 60 and 0 76 with d index values that are very close to 1 0 778 1 000 showed good agreement between the estimated and observed values of tree transpiration these were notably similar in each of the tree species regardless of the equation employed to estimate transpiration it is worth noting that the d index when using the combination equation of three tree species was always the closest to that obtained when using a tree specific equation to estimate water use for a particular tree for instance when estimating the water use for black karee using the black karee equation table 1 the d index was 0 887 the d index of 0 888 obtained when the combination equation was used is closer almost equal to 0 887 than the d indices of 0 871 and 0 843 obtained when using the buffalo thorn and wild olive calibration equations respectively this good agreement was further confirmed by mae 0 001 l h 1 values which were optimal in all cases from the mbe values which ranged between 0 0007 and 0 0008 l h 1 it shows that tree transpiration was estimated with high accuracy for all the trees by all the equations table 1 the slopes of the relationship between the estimated and observed tree water use ranged from 0 691 to 0 980 across all the trees when using the black karee buffalo thorn and combination calibration equations the slopes when using the wild olive calibration equation were between 0 518 and 0 671 which were outside the range obtained from the other equations these were however all good as they were close to 1 the y intercepts were all closer to 0 also indicating good accuracy of the chpv method even at small tree water use levels 4 discussion limited research has been done on the calibration of the chpv method especially on indigenous trees our findings revealed a relatively good agreement between the sap flow estimated tree transpiration and the transpiration measured using lysimeters in both the calibration and validation exercises this was indicated by the high r2 values very low rmse and mae values slopes of the relationships between estimated and observed water use closer to 1 and y intercepts closer to 0 this implied that the estimate given by the sap flow measurement was as good as the transpiration measurement given by the pre calibrated weighing load cells of the lysimeters dye et al 2008 conducted an experiment and compared sap flow measured with chpv method on an excised tree with its water uptake from a big bucket in which the cut stem was submerged in their experiment they also got high r2 values mean 0 79 between the sap flow estimated transpiration and observed water uptake from the bucket dragoni et al 2005 also found good agreement r2 values between 0 87 and 0 94 between the chpv method and whole tree canopy chambers on apple trees using the thd method mcculloh et al 2007 compared sap flow measurements to gravimetrically measured water loss for potted pseudobombax septanatum and calophyllum longfollium tree and found them to be statistically similar p 0 05 indicating a good agreement between the measurement techniques estimations of the tree transpiration were of high accuracy in terms of mbe values that were close to 0 this was truly so when using the tree specific equations as well as the combination equation of the three tree species used with the chpv method over or under estimations of tree water used has previously been attributed to inappropriate wound correction factors poblete echeverría et al 2012 in the present study the appropriate correction factor of 2 8 for the 2 mm drill bit was used as recommended by green et al 2003 the chpv sap flow method is a good candidate for measuring transpiration of south african indigenous trees as it produces accurate estimates however appropriate methods for scaling up from plant to stand and to the whole landscape should be used for water balance calculations all the tree specific calibration equations could be applied on other trees with good accuracy of estimating water use this basically implied that a once off calibration for a certain type of trees e g woody herbaceous etc can be sufficient for using the chpv method to estimate water use the higher agreement between the combination calibration equation y 0 9556 x 0 0107 fig 2d and the tree specific equations warrants its recommendation for water use estimates of indigenous woody tree species of south africa this can eliminate the costs and save time on calibration exercises however caution should be taken on the wood characteristics of trees growing in different climatic zones as the equation may lead to inaccurate tree water use estimations desert trees may exhibit different flow channels within their vascular bundles with our present results it can be ascertained that the combination equation can be applicable on the investigated tree species as well as other woody trees within semi arid and arid regions future work should consider development of calibration equations for other types of plants such as herbaceous trees and test them across different climatic zones since there was no default calibration equations from the manufacturer the combination equation derived during this study can be recommended as the default manufacturer s equation for this specific type of trees default calibration equations from the manufacturer were also found to estimate with high accuracy stem water content of prosopis juliflora sw tamarix ramosissima ledeb and prosopis pubescens benth invasive tree species in sudan and united states saito et al 2016 future work can employ the chpv technique to take continuous measurements of tree transpiration to inform scientists and hence policy makers and administrators on sustainable management of water resources 5 conclusions relationships were developed between the chpv estimated tree transpiration and lysimeter measured tree transpiration resulting in tree specific and a combination equation for the three species the resulted equations were evaluated for accuracy from the results it was observed that irrespective of the tree species the chpv estimated tree transpiration with high accuracy shown by high d indices and low rmse and mae though the developed tree specific calibration equations estimated tree transpiration with high accuracy but were relatively as good as the developed combination calibration equation therefore the developed combination calibration equation can be used across the three tree species used in this investigation and other species with similar wood characteristics since the performance of the calibration equations were similar a once off calibration equation from one tree species can be used to estimate transpiration for the other two species under investigation in this study acknowledgements the kolomela mine is acknowledged for

11553,the compensation heat pulse velocity chpv is one of the most widely used methods to measure sap flow in woody plants however the accuracy of this method has not been fully explored especially for indigenous tree species of south africa the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the chpv method in quantifying tree transpiration for selected tree species three indigenous trees sampled in a monolith form black karee sersia lancea buffalo thorn ziziphus mucronata and wild olive olea africana grown on weighing lysimeters 1 m 1 m 1 3 m were installed with chpv probes to measure sap flow on the stem half hourly simultaneously with lysimeter measurements of transpiration the surfaces of the lysimeters were covered with a 10 cm layer of styrofoam overlain by a 2 cm layer of gravel to minimize evaporation to a negligible level both the lysimeter and chpv measurements were divided into two sets the first set was used to develop tree specific calibration equations as well as an equation combining the three species used here called a combination equation the second set of data was used for validating the equations transpiration rates ranged from negligible at night to daily peaks of 3 5 1 7 and 1 4 l h 1 for buffalo thorn black karee and wild olive respectively good agreement indices between chpv and lysimeters were obtained when using both the tree specific equations and combination equation across species d 0 778 1 000 rmse 0 001 0 017 l h 1 mae 0 001 l h 1 and mbe 0 0007 to 0 0008 l h 1 it was concluded that the chpv method can accurately measure tree water use and therefore can be useful for water resources management in forested areas keywords sap flow calibration tree water use indigenous south african trees 1 introduction there are various ways of quantifying transpiration of field crops but for trees sap flow measurement remains the most prominent an array of automated thermodynamic techniques which use heat as a tracer of sap flow have for several decades been employed to quantify water fluxes in the soil plant atmosphere continuum at the tree scale amongst the thermal based methods of sap flow measurement the most common are the compensation heat pulse velocity chpv huber and schmidt 1937 marshall 1958 swanson 1962 swanson and whitfield 1981 fernández et al 2001 green et al 2003 and thermal heat dissipation thd granier 1987 lu et al 2004 methods these methods are user friendly and cause minimal damage to the tree stems granier 1987 green et al 2003 the chpv method also has an advantage of using less energy as it works on pulses of heat as opposed to the continuous heating principle of the thd fernández et al 2006 nourtier et al 2011 the chpv method has also been employed to measure transpiration of local and exotic commercial forest species of south africa such as eucalyptus species morris et al 2004 wildy et al 2004 and jatropha curcas gush 2008 the accuracy of the chpv method in measuring sap flow in indigenous trees of south africa has unfortunately not been explored lysimetry is considered as one of the standard methods to quantify plant water use johnson et al 2005 clawson et al 2009 especially if their load cells are correctly calibrated misra et al 2011 and can account for various components of the soil water balance while keeping other components under control dlamini et al 2016 even though lysimeters can accurately measure plant water use and can be applied in a number of studies such as soil nutrients evaporation and drainage analysis it has its own drawbacks such as high cost and limited replication the indigenous trees in south africa contribute significantly to the economy of the country in the form of goods and services gush et al 2015 however knowledge on the transpiration of most of these indigenous trees is limited dye et al 2008 the objective of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of chpv method in measuring transpiration of selected indigenous tree species of south africa 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the study was conducted at kenilworth experiment farm latitude 29 02 longitude 26 15 and altitude 1354 m in the department of soil crop and climate sciences at the university of the free state in bloemfontein south africa this experiment was implemented over a period of 107 days during the summer season from 9th december 2016 to 25th march 2017 the study area with a mean annual precipitation of 528 mm mostly falling between october and april and average reference evapotranspiration eto of 1 604 mm is classified as warm semi arid thornthwaite 1948 unesco 1979 peel et al 2007 the mean annual minimum and maximum air temperatures are 11 0 c and 25 5 c respectively 2 2 trees and lysimeter facility an illustration of the equipment setup during the experiment is shown in fig 1 three indigenous trees of dominant species within the study area black karee sersia lancea buffalo thorn ziziphus mucronata and wild olive olea africana were transplanted from within a radius of 3 km away from the study area into lysimeters january 2015 with their natural soil monoliths on average the trees were 4 m 2 5 m 5 m in height and stem diameter between 90 and 120 mm the ages of the trees were estimated to be within the range of 7 10 years the dimensions of lysimeters were 1 m 1 m and 1 3 m in depth the lysimeter containers with their contents soil and trees were placed on top of loadtech lt 1300 type of load cells supplied the loadtech load cells pty ltd south africa the load cells were placed on top of flat concrete slabs to ensure they remain level during the experiment the soil surface on top of the monoliths was covered by a 10 cm layer of styrofoam and then overlain by a 2 cm layer of gravel to minimize evaporation to negligible levels 2 3 compensation heat pulse velocity theory in the chpv method two temperature sensors are inserted at unequal distances downstream and upstream of a radially inserted heater in the stem the upstream probe is placed closer to the heater 5 mm and increase temperature faster through conduction than the downstream probe placed 10 mm away whose temperature change is influenced by transfer of energy by conduction through the wood and convection through the flowing sap whenever a heat pulse is released by the heater the time taken by the two sensors to record equal temperature rise is related to the movement of sap flow and hence the plant water uptake swanson and whitfield 1981 green et al 2003 the heat pulse velocity vh in cm h 1 is calculated from the time t taken to record equal temperatures by the sensors at distances xu upstream and xd downstream as 1 v h x u x d 2 t vh is basically indirectly proportional to t this implies that if the sap movement is high the convection of the heat pulse through the moving sap will be enhanced and then the recorded t will be minimal early studies revealed that the movement of the sap is a few folds more than the movement of heat in terms of sap flow density through the sapwood because the heat is also dependent on conduction through the stationary interstitial tissue between the xylem vessels or tracheids marshall 1958 established a relationship between vh and the sap flux q and expressed it as 2 q a u ρ s m c s m ρ s c s v h where a is the fraction of the cross sectional area of the conducting sapwood occupied by moving sap u is the velocity of sap ρ and care density and specific heat capacity with subscripts s and sm referring to the sap and sap plus woody matrix respectively v h can be expressed in terms of the basic density ρ b and the water content w c of the sapwood as estimated as 3 ρ b oven dried mass of wood fresh volume of wood 4 w c fresh mass of wood oven dried mass of wood oven dried mass of wood the density ρ of the fresh wood can also be expressed 5 ρ ρ b 1 w c the specific heat c can be expressed as 6 c c w w c c s 1 w c where c w specific heat of oven dry wood 0 33c s specific heat of sap water 1 0s density of sap 1 0 eq 2 on substitution then becomes 7 q ρ b w c 0 33 v h sap flux estimated using eq 7 can be referred to as raw values of sap velocity as the procedure that was used to obtain this equation assumed the sapwood material to be isotropic marshall 1958 something which is not a true reflection of reality the velocity of sap varies with radial depth into the stem before the application of eq 7 to establish the flux density of sap the measured values of v h must be corrected to account for i the influence on heat transfer of the material used to construct the heater and sensor probes and ii the effects of the wounding due to drills into the wood empirical functions to make these corrections for a variety of materials used to construct heaters and sensors and for a range of drill spacing were derived by swanson and whitfield 1981 green and clothier 1988 and green et al 2003 to establish the volumetric flow rates q v the sap flux is measured at different depths below the cambium of a stem in order to determine a radial profile of sap flux across the sapwood a second order least squares regression equation fitted to the sap velocity profile is used to calculate q v l h 1 edwards and warwick 1984 green and clothier 1988 green et al 2003 as 8 q v 2 π h r r q r d r where r m is the cambium radius of the stem and h is the heartwood radius 2 4 tree water use measurements water use by the trees was monitored using the prior calibrated load cells and the chpv technique changes in mass indicating water gain or loss in each of the lysimeters was obtained from the outputs of the load cells which were all connected to a datalogger cr 3000 campell scientific inc logan ut usa the signals from the load cells were sampled every minute and the average stored half hourly the change in mass recorded by the load cell was converted into transpiration t in l h 1 as follows 9 t 2 x 1 x 2 where x 1is the initial mass at the beginning of half an hour and x 2 is the final mass at the end every half an hour alongside the load cell measurements tree water uptake was monitored using the chpv technique installed on the stems at approximately 0 5 m above the soil surface to make provision for the bias due to the variation in azimuthal variability of the sap flow density during the day or season wullschleger and king 2000 saveyn et al 2008 two sets of the chpv technique were installed on an individual tree in a spiral pattern around the tree stem for each set the two temperature sensor probes installed upstream and downstream of the heater had thermistors at depths of 5 15 25 and 40 mm below the cambium in this way assessment of radial profile and its temporal variability for individual tree were made possible sap flow data were recorded and stored in a datalogger cr1000 campell scientific inc logan ut usa the sap flow gadgets were covered by aluminium foil to minimize external environmental effects on the sensors these measurements were taken across a range of soil water content from near saturation to at least 30 of available water aw in the top 80 cm aw is the difference between the predetermined drained upper limit and drained lower limit of the soil as explained by hensley et al 2011 the soil water content was always brought back to field capacity whenever aw approaches 30 part of the irrigation aim for the study was to ensure that the trees did not go into stress throughout the year hydrascout capacitance probes hscp manufactured by hydra sensor technologies international ltd in south africa was used to monitor the soil water content throughout the experiment prior to the beginning of the study hscp probes were calibrated in the laboratory and in the field against the standard gravimetric method for soil water measurements across the depth of each soil profile in all the points where trees were sampled the accuracy of the chpv method to estimate water use by the selected indigenous trees was tested against the lysimeter measurements 2 5 statistical analysis tree water use data measured by both the lysimeter and chpv techniques were divided into two sets the first set of data was used to generate the calibration equations by regressing the lysimeter transpiration data against the chpv data for the three trees the calibration data from the three lysimeter units were also pooled together to form a relationship referred to as the combination equation an equation combining data of the three tree species the four equations three tree specific and combination were evaluated by applying them on the chpv data from the second data set to estimate the corresponding lysimeter data for a particular time to test the versatility of the equations across tree species each of the four equations was applied in all the three tree species the goodness of fit for the predicted transpiration values against the lysimeter measurements was determined by the coefficient of determination r2 and d index of agreement d eq 10 the accuracy of estimation was determined by the root mean square error rmse eq 11 and mean absolute error mae eq 12 the mean bias error mbe eq 13 was computed to determine the deviation of the predicted tree transpiration from the lysimeter measured transpiration willmott 1982 walther and moore 2005 10 d 1 i 1 n e

transpiration observed or measured lysimeter transpiration and mean values for the lysimeter measurements respectively any model with r2 approaching 1 has a good performance a d index close to 1 as well as rmse and mae close to 0 indicates good agreement between measured and estimated values willmott 1982 a negative mbe indicates that the sap flow measurement is underestimating the lysimeter measured transpiration and vice versa the closer the mbe value is to 0 the better abbas et al 2011 3 results 3 1 calibration equations after the tree transpiration measured by lysimeter and sap flow meter has been converted to the same unit l h 1 it can be observed that different ranges of transpiration were observed for different tree species fig 2 out of the 3 tree species the maximum transpiration was observed in buffalo thorn which was above 3 5 l h 1 from lysimeter measurement transpiration rates of up to 1 7 l h 1 and 1 4 l h 1 were observed for black karee and wild olive respectively the relationships between the lysimeter transpiration and sap flow measurements on the different trees individually and across tree species is presented in fig 2 based on the highest r2 these relationships were described by linear equations the r2 values were 0 65 for black karee 0 75 for buffalo thorn 0 62 for wild olive and 0 69 for the combination calibration 3 2 validation of the calibration equations the application of all the tree specific and combination calibration equations on the second set of data for each of the three tree species to estimate transpiration using the sap flow data is presented in fig 3 a l the summary of statistical performance of the developed equations is presented in table 1 the observed rmse values were all small 0 001 0 017 l h 1 for the tree specific calibration equations and the combination equation across the trees the r2 values that ranged between 0 60 and 0 76 with d index values that are very close to 1 0 778 1 000 showed good agreement between the estimated and observed values of tree transpiration these were notably similar in each of the tree species regardless of the equation employed to estimate transpiration it is worth noting that the d index when using the combination equation of three tree species was always the closest to that obtained when using a tree specific equation to estimate water use for a particular tree for instance when estimating the water use for black karee using the black karee equation table 1 the d index was 0 887 the d index of 0 888 obtained when the combination equation was used is closer almost equal to 0 887 than the d indices of 0 871 and 0 843 obtained when using the buffalo thorn and wild olive calibration equations respectively this good agreement was further confirmed by mae 0 001 l h 1 values which were optimal in all cases from the mbe values which ranged between 0 0007 and 0 0008 l h 1 it shows that tree transpiration was estimated with high accuracy for all the trees by all the equations table 1 the slopes of the relationship between the estimated and observed tree water use ranged from 0 691 to 0 980 across all the trees when using the black karee buffalo thorn and combination calibration equations the slopes when using the wild olive calibration equation were between 0 518 and 0 671 which were outside the range obtained from the other equations these were however all good as they were close to 1 the y intercepts were all closer to 0 also indicating good accuracy of the chpv method even at small tree water use levels 4 discussion limited research has been done on the calibration of the chpv method especially on indigenous trees our findings revealed a relatively good agreement between the sap flow estimated tree transpiration and the transpiration measured using lysimeters in both the calibration and validation exercises this was indicated by the high r2 values very low rmse and mae values slopes of the relationships between estimated and observed water use closer to 1 and y intercepts closer to 0 this implied that the estimate given by the sap flow measurement was as good as the transpiration measurement given by the pre calibrated weighing load cells of the lysimeters dye et al 2008 conducted an experiment and compared sap flow measured with chpv method on an excised tree with its water uptake from a big bucket in which the cut stem was submerged in their experiment they also got high r2 values mean 0 79 between the sap flow estimated transpiration and observed water uptake from the bucket dragoni et al 2005 also found good agreement r2 values between 0 87 and 0 94 between the chpv method and whole tree canopy chambers on apple trees using the thd method mcculloh et al 2007 compared sap flow measurements to gravimetrically measured water loss for potted pseudobombax septanatum and calophyllum longfollium tree and found them to be statistically similar p 0 05 indicating a good agreement between the measurement techniques estimations of the tree transpiration were of high accuracy in terms of mbe values that were close to 0 this was truly so when using the tree specific equations as well as the combination equation of the three tree species used with the chpv method over or under estimations of tree water used has previously been attributed to inappropriate wound correction factors poblete echeverría et al 2012 in the present study the appropriate correction factor of 2 8 for the 2 mm drill bit was used as recommended by green et al 2003 the chpv sap flow method is a good candidate for measuring transpiration of south african indigenous trees as it produces accurate estimates however appropriate methods for scaling up from plant to stand and to the whole landscape should be used for water balance calculations all the tree specific calibration equations could be applied on other trees with good accuracy of estimating water use this basically implied that a once off calibration for a certain type of trees e g woody herbaceous etc can be sufficient for using the chpv method to estimate water use the higher agreement between the combination calibration equation y 0 9556 x 0 0107 fig 2d and the tree specific equations warrants its recommendation for water use estimates of indigenous woody tree species of south africa this can eliminate the costs and save time on calibration exercises however caution should be taken on the wood characteristics of trees growing in different climatic zones as the equation may lead to inaccurate tree water use estimations desert trees may exhibit different flow channels within their vascular bundles with our present results it can be ascertained that the combination equation can be applicable on the investigated tree species as well as other woody trees within semi arid and arid regions future work should consider development of calibration equations for other types of plants such as herbaceous trees and test them across different climatic zones since there was no default calibration equations from the manufacturer the combination equation derived during this study can be recommended as the default manufacturer s equation for this specific type of trees default calibration equations from the manufacturer were also found to estimate with high accuracy stem water content of prosopis juliflora sw tamarix ramosissima ledeb and prosopis pubescens benth invasive tree species in sudan and united states saito et al 2016 future work can employ the chpv technique to take continuous measurements of tree transpiration to inform scientists and hence policy makers and administrators on sustainable management of water resources 5 conclusions relationships were developed between the chpv estimated tree transpiration and lysimeter measured tree transpiration resulting in tree specific and a combination equation for the three species the resulted equations were evaluated for accuracy from the results it was observed that irrespective of the tree species the chpv estimated tree transpiration with high accuracy shown by high d indices and low rmse and mae though the developed tree specific calibration equations estimated tree transpiration with high accuracy but were relatively as good as the developed combination calibration equation therefore the developed combination calibration equation can be used across the three tree species used in this investigation and other species with similar wood characteristics since the performance of the calibration equations were similar a once off calibration equation from one tree species can be used to estimate transpiration for the other two species under investigation in this study acknowledgements the kolomela mine is acknowledged for

11554,the paddy land to dry land pldl program was a 10 year long 2006 2015 agricultural engineering program initiated jointly by beijing and heibei province that was designed to increase urban water availability and improve household livelihoods in local farming communities the program supported by government subsidy involved conversion of paddy oryza sativa to maize zea mays in this study a range of environmental social and economic indicators were used to evaluate the program in relation to its primary goal of saving water the program was considered successful with water consumption of maize production 47 lower the subsidy was also found to be influential in encouraging household participation however the small size of household farms and the small proportion of household revenues coming from agricultural production meant that the pldl program did little to directly improve household livelihoods environmental indicators assessed using life cycle assessment showed mixed results although most indicators improved some deteriorated namely acidification and eutrophication potential this highlights the importance of assessing environmental performance comprehensively to avoid burden shifting important environmental impacts could potentially have been reduced if the program had provided additional technological support to farmers nevertheless the aggregated lca results suggested that overall environmental performance was improved the pldl program could also be viewed as a success from the perspective that the monetarized ecosystem service benefits greatly exceeded the subsidy payment an important spillover benefit was that participating households were able to achieve greater participation in non farm employment which contributed to higher household incomes and poverty alleviation an important finding of this study is that an agricultural engineering program designed to alleviate water scarcity can have wide ranging environmental economic and social impacts keywords ecological engineering energy efficiency life cycle assessment environment load economic performance social impact 1 introduction water resource shortage and water security are important global issues of the 21st century food production social stability and sustainable development can all be impacted by water scarcity and climate change is further exacerbating the problem in many places chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 lal 2015 he and cai 2016 while china has 2 81 103 billion m3 yr 1 of freshwater supply the 6th most in the world sun 2015 sun et al 2016 two critical factors that threat china s sustainable development are uneven distribution of water resources and shortage of water per capita to illustrate the yangtze river basin and south china has 36 of national farmland and 80 of national water resources in contrast north china with around 40 of farmland has a mere 8 of water resources sun et al 2016 the global per capita availability of water resource is 8 800 m3 but only 2 200 m3 in china and 500 m3 in north china huang et al 2012 the per capita availability of water was 100 m3 in 2014 in beijing bwa 2015 which is far below the internationally recognized threshold of 1 000 m3 huang et al 2012 water scarcity is threatening china s sustainable development especially that of north china therefore china must adopt appropriate strategies to address this issue since 1995 a variety of projects have been implemented in the cities of zhangjiakou and chendeng to address water scarcity and improve the livelihoods of the people liu 2012 zheng et al 2013 lin et al 2016a b these cities are located to the north of beijing and are affiliated administratively with hebei province fig 1 these programs include water saving agricultural practices sewage treatment improved watershed management and the paddy land to dry land pldl program among others the pldl program was implemented over ten years 2006 2015 and involved three counties containing 15 213 households and 6 866 ha of farmland however various concerns have been raised about the pldl program farmers were financially incentivized to replace rice cultivation with maize however the adequacy of the compensation and overall impact on livelihoods has been questioned dong and li 2007 liu 2012 liang et al 2013a b cui 2014 liu et al 2015 lin et al 2016a b some researchers concluded that the project improved water quantity and quality zheng et al 2013 dai and zhang 2014 however liu 2012 and liang et al 2013a b reported that the implementation of the pldl program increased loading of n p and pesticides to water zheng et al 2013 opined that increases in loading of nutrients has resulted in other environmental risks such as high concentration of nitrates in groundwater soil acidification acid rains greenhouse gas ghg emissions etc what has been lacking is a comprehensive evaluation of the pldl program spanning the ten year period and utilizing multiple environmental and economic indicators the comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of agricultural ecological engineering projects covering both the environmental and human dimensions has become a popular research themes for example sartori et al 2005 assessed energy use and economics of a 3 year crop rotation for conservation and organic farming in ne italy oudshoorn et al 2011 explored the sustainability of future organic dairy farming systems in denmark by evaluating the economic and environmental consequences of three scenarios at the farm level andersson et al 2015 made a social ecological analysis of ecosystem services in two different farming systems based on the life cycle assessment lca approach kamali et al 2017 evaluated a number of environmental economic and social issues for different soybean farming systems in southern brazil wang et al 2014 used lca to evaluate two different winter wheat summer maize rotation models synthesis of these and other studies suggested that a comprehensive assessment combining environmental and economic aspects can be beneficial wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 kamali et al 2017 the objective of this study was to make a comprehensive assessment of the pldl program based on multiple methods and models firstly an energy efficiency analysis was conducted using an input output methodology secondly lca was used to estimate environmental effects of the transition from cultivation of paddy rice to maize thirdly the economic benefits of the changed systems were estimated using an input output balance approach fourthly both ecological service value and social impact were analyzed based on surveys involving questionnaires and interviews finally an integrated indicator was created to assist in interpretation of the overall change 2 the study area and method 2 1 the study area and pldl program the pldl program was implemented in various districts of beijing and in three counties of hebei province chicheng fengning and luanping beijing located in the north china plain ncp covers an area of 16 411 km2 and had a population of 21 7 million in 2015 bjmbs 2014 2016 in 2014 the total water resource consumption was 3 75 billion m3 and the per capita water resource availability was just 94 m3 bwa 2015 in 2020 and 2030 the total water resource requirement is projected to increase to 5 3 109 m3 and 5 6 109 m3 respectively sun 2015 miyun reservoir is the only surface water resource for domestic water and the chaobai river watershed is the main source the upstream of chaobai river watershed covers the three counties affiliated to chengde and zhangjiakou city the downstream is in beijing and enters miyun reservoir fig 1 eventually the river runs into the ocean in tianjin district from 2006 2015 beijing and hebei province jointly promoted the pldl program in the three counties along the chaobai river the peasants were advised to substitute cultivation of spring maize for traditional paddy rice and to gradually reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides as an incentive the government paid peasants an economic subsidy of 6 750 yuan ha 1 yr 1 8 yuan 1 us in 2006 and from 2008 the amount was increased to 8 250 yuan ha 1 yr 1 in 2015 the beijing government declared the program a success but decided to focus on other water saving initiatives instead of the pldl program thus the pldl program was terminated in order to obtain background data on the pldl program interviews were conducted with local government authorities including the bureau of agriculture and water authority in each of the three counties following this questionnaire surveys were conducted in november 2015 with households in the townships involved for further comparative analysis a supplementary investigation was undertaken in march of 2016 the survey included both participating and non participating households each questionnaire included two parts one part related to farming inputs and production levels and the other part was focused on attitudes to the pldl program and lifestyle changes that had occurred as a result of it 2 2 energy assessment an energy balance approach was used to evaluate the energy use efficiency eue of the paddy and maize farming systems the total energy inputs were comprised of nonrenewable inorganic and renewable organic energy and were calculated by eq 1 nonrenewable energy inputs included use of machinery diesel electricity irrigation canals chemical fertilizers and pesticides seed and labor were regarded as renewable energy inputs the outputs included grain and straw table 1 describes the input output inventory and energy coefficients used 1 etotal enonrenewable erenewable 2 3 life cycle assessment lca is a tool to systematically evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle iso 2006a b four stages are involved namely goal and scope definition life cycle inventory lci analysis life cycle impact assessment lcia and result interpretation 2 3 1 goal and scope definition the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the environmental performance of paddy rice and maize grown in the regions where the pldl program was implemented in this study a cradle to farm gate approach was adopted brentrup et al 2001 2004 this included all inputs from the cradle such as raw materials extraction to the farm gate namely the harvested crop all of the operational inputs were taken into account including agricultural machine production diesel fuel irrigation canals fertilizers pesticides electricity etc the system was divided into two subsystems 1 the off farm system included raw materials extraction processing and transportation as well as the production of farming inputs and their packaging and transportation and 2 the on farm system that included the emissions from farming practices fig 2 nemecek et al 2011 described three ways of expressing agricultural lca results in relation to commodity output farm revenues and per area farmed for this study it was deemed relevant to report results according to commodity output per mg product and per land area ha 2 3 2 life cycle inventory the data describing resources used and crop production were collected from the questionnaire survey table 1 uses of farm machinery seeder rotary cultivator harvester etc were calculated following liu 1982 and chen 2011 data relating to the production maintenance of farm machinery and the fuel use and emission related to their operation was sourced from li 2014 yao et al 2011 and gao et al 2013 data relating to irrigation infrastructure came from li et al 2011 emissions of ghgs e g co2 ch4 and n2o nox and so2 were computed for the use of chemicals pesticides electricity seeds and diesel fuel according to the methods described by liang 2009 for the on farm subsystem direct emissions from the application of fertilizers were calculated using relevant local coefficients these emissions included ammonia nh3 nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 emissions to air as well nitrate and phosphorous p emissions to water emissions of heavy metals into agricultural soil surface water and groundwater were also taken into account the coefficients of nh3 volatilization for paddy and spring maize were 15 4 and 24 7 of nitrogen n fertilizers use respectively yang et al 2015 ju et al 2009 regarding n2o and ch4 emissions the magnitude of such emissions are influenced by fertilizer use and soil typology duan et al 2014 ju et al 2009 harada et al 2007 hu et al 2013 xu 2011 xu 2011 and duan et al 2014 reported that the coefficients of n2o n emission of paddy and maize production were 0 8 and 0 9 of total n fertilizer input respectively based on local field experiments in the study area by chen et al 1992 and zhang et al 1994 a methane emission from paddy of 17 5 mg m 2 h 1 was used similarly it was assumed that 8 45 and 15 12 of n fertilizer inputs to paddy and maize production were leached into water in the form of total n yang et al 2015 ju et al 2009 coefficients of p loss in paddy and maize production were 1 1 and 1 of p fertilizer use respectively wang et al 2006 li and jin 2011 zhang et al 2015a b the potential impacts of heavy metals i e cu cd zn pb were evaluated from the input output balance the sources of inputs of heavy metals included irrigation water fertilizers and atmospheric deposition removals of heavy metal from the system included the harvesting of grains and straws yang 2013 zhang 2013 the household surveys identified that all crop residues were removed from the farmland because of scarcity of the pertinent data it was assumed that except for heavy metal removed with irrigation water grain and straw the remainder entered into agricultural soil the coefficients of pesticide residues released into the atmosphere water and soil were 10 1 and 43 of the active ingredients used respectively van calker et al 2004 2 3 3 life cycle impact assessment lcia the life cycle impact assessment lcia was performed to further understand the environmental relevance of the lci data the approach to impact assessment normalization and weighting was adopted from liang 2009 and liang et al 2017 the environmental impact categories assessed included non renewable energy requirement nrer water resource depletion wrd global warming potential gwp acidification potential ap eutrophication potential ep human toxicity potential htp fresh aquatic toxicity potential fatp and terrestrial toxicity potential ttp table 2 the particular impact assessment models used were taken from literature liu 1982 deng and wang 2003 brentrup et al 2001 huijbregts et al 2000 for ghg emissions the 100 year global warming potentials published by the ipcc 2007 were used 2 3 4 life cycle interpretation life cycle interpretation was the final step of the lca methodology this included contribution analysis to identify important life cycle stages and contributing factors as well as comparison of alternative scenarios blengini and busto 2009 2 4 economic assessment the economic assessment compared the farm related profitability of households that participated in the pldl program against households that did not for participating households income included the government subsidy for pldl participation data were obtained from the household survey section 2 1 and the results were expressed per ha of farmland cultivated in general most of the households depended on their own labor for performing farm operations therefore the cost of labor was not taken into account according to chinese custom eq 2 was used to calculate and analyze the two scenarios 2 edp emp esp epp where edp is the difference between participating pldl households and non participating households emp is the net profit of maize production esp is the subsidy from the government and epp is the net profit of paddy production 2 5 ecological and social assessment there are many potential ecological service benefits associated with modified farming systems this study focused on water availability and ghg emission reduction as the ecological services most relevant to the pldl program following eq 3 3 eν σ emi epi pi where eν is the total value of ecological service emi and epi are the amount of ith ecological service of maize and paddy production respectively pi is the market price of ith ecological service in addition two indicators were used to assess the social impact one indicator was the change in household income including agricultural and non agricultural sources of income the second indicator was participation in employment outside the agricultural sector 2 6 comprehensive assessment in order to assist interpretation of the combined impact of the pldl program an integrated indicator was also calculated following zhong 2014 the integrated indicator included four components eue weighting lca score net profit and ecological service value the indicator was calculated using eq 4 4 ic σ w vmi vpi ri where ic is the integrated indicator w is the coefficient of weighting and the value of the four aspects is 0 25 respectively zhong 2014 vmi and vpi are the values of ith impact of maize and paddy production respectively and ri is the reference value of ith impact the reference values were the average values across the period 2009 2011 which for eue weighting lca score net profit and ecological service value were 2 64 liu et al 2013 7 15 liang 2009 6 195 yuan ha 1 luo et al 2017 and 6 114 yuan ha 1 li et al 2016 respectively 3 results 3 1 energy efficiency analysis tables 3 and 4 present the energy inputs and outputs for paddy and maize as well as several energy use efficiency ratios in comparison with the paddy production the total energy inputs for maize production were 23 3 lower in 2006 and 18 5 lower in 2015 however for both crops the total energy inputs increased from 2006 to 2015 largely due to the increased input of inorganic materials i e machinery diesel and chemical fertilizers inorganic energy inputs were the primary source of total energy inputs for paddy production inorganic energy inputs represented 88 2 of total energy inputs in 2006 and 90 4 in 2015 for maize the proportion of inorganic energy input was even higher 92 0 in 2006 and 94 6 in 2015 in contrast the increase in grain yield of paddy and maize were only 1 8 for both crops consequently the ratios of total outputs grain and straw combined total inputs inorganic and organic energy combined decreased over time from 5 2 to 4 5 for paddy and from 8 0 to 6 6 in the case of maize table 4 these trends indicate that the eue improved as a result of cultivating maize rather than paddy however the eue of production of both crops decreased over time as increases in resource inputs achieved only modest yield gains 3 2 environmental performance and assessment based on lca 3 2 1 resource consumption for both paddy and maize production the off farm subsystem was responsible for 96 1 of the total nrer of which n production accounted for 68 3 77 9 of the total followed by machinery electricity and pesticides table 5 in comparison to paddy the nrer of maize production was 12 8 13 6 lower in regards to the off farm subsystem seed production was the major factor contributing to wrd followed by n fertilizer production however the off farm subsystem made only a minor contribution to total wrd with the on farm subsystem contributing 96 1 98 5 mainly in the form of irrigation water use in contrast to paddy production the water consumption of maize production was 47 lower and the quantity of water saving was 380 m3 per mg of grain due to the change of planting model and reduction in the irrigation ratio 3 2 2 characterization of pollutant emissions comparing paddy and maize production the lca results were mixed table 6 fig 3 lca impact category indictor results for maize were 75 7 80 2 lower for gwp 25 1 36 7 lower for htp 28 2 55 4 lower for fatp and 23 6 81 8 lower for ttp however for maize the results for ap and ep were both higher than paddy the gwp of paddy and maize were both dominated by field emissions from the on farm subsystem and n fertilizer production in the off farm subsystem fig 4 from 2006 to 2015 the total gwp per mg of paddy rice increased from 2 686 to 2 733 kg co2 eq the gwp per mg maize also increased over this period from 531 to 663 kg co2 eq the pldl program therefore achieved large reductions in ghg emission as farmlands changed from being a source to a sink for ch4 hu et al 2013 harada et al 2007 the ap of paddy and maize production was primarily due to nh3 volatilization in the on farm subsystem increased n fertilizer inputs from 2006 to 2015 led to increasing ap in both systems however the coefficient of nh3 volatilization of maize was higher than that of paddy and consequently the total ap increased from 2006 to 2015 similar to ap ep was mainly related to the on farm subsystem and dominated by nh3 volatilization and n leaching in comparison with the paddy production the total ep per mg maize increased by 27 5 and 36 8 in 2006 and 2015 respectively pesticides and heavy metals were the two major factors contributing to htp fatp and ttp in this study all the three toxicity types for paddy were higher than those for maize because of higher pesticide herbicide and fungicide use with higher toxicity ingredients as well as higher heavy metal loadings through irrigation of the paddy system in contrast to 2006 both paddy and maize production systems used more pesticides in 2015 however the toxicity of the active ingredients was lower in 2015 consequently htp fatp and ttp decreased over time fig 4 presents the toxicity profiles of both crop production systems the htp of paddy and maize systems were dominated by heavy metals with regards to fatp for the period from 2006 to 2015 the toxicity potentials of both systems from heavy metals remained relatively stable table 7 and pesticide use was the major factor in 2006 due to the use of higher toxicity pesticides e g triazophos atrazine acephatemet the total fatp was 74 4 and 33 6 kg 1 4 dcbeq per mg of paddy and maize production respectively by limiting the use of these higher toxicity pesticides the values of fatp were lower in 2015 at 8 74 and 9 46 kg 1 4 dcbeq per mg of paddy and maize grain respectively with regards to ttp the toxicity potential to the terrestrial ecosystem large decreases were observed from 2006 to 2015 for the same reasons outlined above table 7 3 2 3 environment indices during the normalization step each of the environmental impact category indicator results was divided by china s per capita environmental impact value for 2010 table 8 wrd ep and fatp were identified as the three major environmental burdens of paddy and maize production in 2006 and 2015 the normalized results for wrd were 1 81 and 1 77 for paddy and 0 95 and 0 93 for maize production whereas the values for maize were lower compared to paddy production these values were still close to that of the per capita annual wrd burden the normalized results for ep for paddy and maize increased from 1 39 and 1 77 in 2006 to 1 58 and 2 16 in 2015 respectively this trend suggests that the risks of eutrophication were 139 177 158 and 216 of the average per capita value for china in 2010 in contrast the normalized results for fatp of paddy and maize decreased from 17 5 and 7 8 in 2006 to 3 9 and 2 8 in 2015 nonetheless risks of freshwater toxicity impacts remain high for weighting the normalized results were multiplied by the corresponding weighting factors and all values were summed the single score results in 2006 and 2015 were 2 81 and 1 16 for paddy and 1 44 and 0 95 for maize respectively table 8 in comparison with paddy the total environmental burden of maize production was 48 8 lower in 2006 and 17 7 lower in 2015 3 3 economic performance net profit from paddy and maize production in 2006 was 13 425 and 16 275 yuan ha 1 respectively table 9 the government subsidy of 6 750 yuan ha 1 for maize production under the pldl program made an important contribution to the 2 850 yuan ha 1 higher net profit obtained with maize however by 2015 the results had changed with maize production achieving a lower net profit even with the government subsidy the lower net income of maize production was attributed to the increase in market value of rice from around 2 000 3 000 yuan mg 1 from 2006 to 2015 in comparison the market value of maize only increased from 1 500 to 1 800 yuan mg 1 during the same period 3 4 ecological and social performance the ecological service values per ha under the pldl program were 17 457 yuan in 2006 and 17 353 yuan in 2015 table 10 regarding social metrics in 2006 households received similar revenues regardless of whether or not they participated in the pldl program households participating in the pldl program received a slightly greater proportion of their income from sources outside agriculture 78 4 compared to 75 9 table 11 fig 5 however by 2015 households participating in the pldl program had a much higher income 26 270 yuan compared to 22 355 yuan with a markedly higher participation in non agricultural employment 89 1 of income compared to 80 9 3 5 comprehensive performance the integrated indicator of pldl performance was 1 33 in 2006 and 0 78 in 2015 the overall impact of the pldl program remained positive over time however the benefits have been in overall decline with declines in the environmental dimension the most prominent table 12 4 discussion 4 1 energy efficiency in agro ecosystems the eue of maize production was higher than that of paddy which was a benefit of the pldl program however the eue of both systems declined over time as increasing resource inputs achieved only modest gains in yields the intensification of agricultural production was also shown to raise other environmental concerns as evidenced by the lca indicator results table 7 reducing energy inputs and improving eue can both support sustainable development and these are common objectives throughout the world khan and hanjra 2009 alluvione et al 2011 chen et al 2008 deike et al 2008 erdal et al 2007 gelfand et al 2010 hülsbergen et al 2001 jose 2009 lin et al 2016a b liu 1982 1984 swanton et al 1996 ye and li 2002 in china ju et al 2006 zheng et al 2013 and ju and gu 2014 all reported that the levels of agricultural inputs tend to be higher in the north china plain region than in other districts liu 1984 1984 zhang et al 2015a b and yuan and peng 2017 also undertook integrated eue assessments in relation to china s agricultural production earlier studies arising from the 1980s made suggestions about increasing energy inputs to increase eue however by the 1990s and in some high yielding districts crop yields stagnated despite additional input of both organic and inorganic energy chen et al 2008 ju et al 2006 liang et al 2011 liu et al 2010a b ye and li 2002 many studies have shown that crop intensification follows a trend of diminishing marginal returns beyond a critical threshold lin et al 2016a b khan and hanjra 2009 ye and li 2002 liu et al 2013 analyzed the c efficiency of china s intensive farming over the last five decades the present study used these data and evaluated the energy input and eue of china s agro ecosystems between 1952 and 2010 table 13 several major changes are highlighted firstly the proportion of inorganic energy input has greatly increased from 1 4 to 71 2 of total energy input with corresponding decreases in the proportion of organic energy input secondly the eue has increased greatly since 1950 taking 1952 as the baseline value of 1 the growth rate of total input and grain output are shown in fig 6 the results show that from 1952 to 1980 the growth rates of total input and grain production were in proportion however this relation was broken during the 1990s compared to 1952 the total energy input in 1990 increased 4 4 times while the grain production increased only by 3 8 times the difference was further enlarged and reached 7 7 and 4 5 times in 2010 fig 6 this trend implies that since the 1990s the rate of increase of eue has lagged behind that of the energy input in china studies from zhang et al 2015a b and yuan and peng 2017 confirm this trend compared to other countries there still exists great space to increase the eue of agriculture for china in this study the eue of paddy production ranged from 2 60 to 3 05 table 4 and the result from lu et al 2010 was 2 26 these results for paddy systems in china are higher than has been reported in india 0 79 united states 1 42 and iran 1 52 but far lower than that of philippines 5 51 pimentel 2009 pishgar komleh et al 2011 quilty et al 2014 as for maize production the corresponding value was between 3 35 and 4 19 table 4 which is higher than iran 1 81 and almost equal to turkey 3 8 and united states 4 11 but far lower than italy 8 6 tabar et al 2010 alluvione et al 2011 canakci et al 2005 pimentel 2009 thus for china and for many other countries improving eue of agro ecosystems remains an important goal 4 2 environmental performance of agro ecosystems the lca approach used in the present study was different than that adopted by other researchers because the full range of capital items machinery production and maintenance irrigation facilities etc was included cai et al 2011 huang et al 2011 li et al 2010 liang et al 2009 lu et al 2012 the results showed that some indicators were lower under the pldl program e g nrer wrd gwp and htp however other indicators remain a priority for impact reduction e g ap ep and fatp while pldl program realized the goal of water saving the quality of water was unlikely to have improved high inputs of chemical fertilizer were the major reasons contributing to ap and ep according to contract signed by local governments and households participating in the pldl program fertilizer and pesticides use should have been reduced the reality however was that the quantity of fertilizer used has increased over the last ten years the increase in fertilizer use was necessitated by a decrease in the fertility of farmland soil when maize was substituted for paddy and increase in incidence of pests and pathogens by absence of flooding and the lack of application of sludge provided by the river under these conditions increasing the input of fertilizers and pesticides was the commonly observed response from peasant farmers with limited technical knowledge and technological support the pldl program provided a financial subsidy to encourage participation however the pldl program may have achieved better environmental outcomes if the local farmers had also been provided greater levels of technological support since the 1990s lca has become an important assessment tool in agro ecosystem research anderson et al 1994 kramer et al 1999 brentrup et al 2001 2004 the methodology was also introduced in china during the late 1990s and has since been used widely wang et al 2006 cheng et al 2011 huang et al 2013 li et al 2010 liang 2009 liang et al 2013a b liu et al 2010a b lu et al 2012 xia and yan 2011 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 however most researchers have primarily addressed single impact categories e g gwp ap and ep however an important concern in lca is to avoid burden shifting the lca results for the pldl program illustrate how initiatives designed to address one environmental concern can unintentionally exacerbate others as such greater application of lca where a full range of environmental indicators are used is encouraged both in china and elsewhere 4 3 eco efficiency ee and payment for ecosystem service pes ee is an expression of efficiency of an economic activity with regard to its impact upon nature it is represented by the ratio product or service value environmental influence oecd 1998 environmental impacts for ee calculations usually include energy use resource use water use and ghg emissions among others verfaillie and bidwell 2000 using the lca approach to evaluate the ee of a production system product or service has become popular in recent years basset mens et al 2009 bleischwitz 2003 kulak et al 2013 2016 müller et al 2015 pelletier and tyedmers 2008 thanawong et al 2014 for the pldl program the lca results demonstrated improvement in some environmental indicators and deterioration in others tables 7 and 8 that said the weighted lca results suggested that the overall environmental performance was improved table 8 as such it can be concluded that the pldl program resulted in an overall improvement in eco efficiency in china payment for ecosystem services pes is typically called ecological compensation dong and li 2007 lin et al 2016a b liu 2012 zheng et al 2013 the subsidy provided to households for participation in the pldl program was a type of ecological compensation designed to increase water availability in this study two ecosystem services were monetarized gwp and wrd table 10 in 2006 and 2015 the value of ecological service from the pldl program amounted to 17 457 and 17 353 yuan ha 1 yr 1 of which the subsidies were only 6 750 and 8 250 yuan ha 1 yr 1 respectively as such the subsidy was less than 50 of the estimated value and a case could be made for continuation of the program cui 2014 lin et al 2016a b zheng et al 2013 during the 2015 interviews many of the households participating in the pldl program indicated that the market differential between paddy rice and maize meant that without the government subsidy they would have likely returned to cultivating paddy rice naturally any withdrawal from the pldl program would lead to increased pressure on local water resources 4 4 employment opportunities and economic revenue in the regions where the pldl program was implemented the typical family farm holding is rather small 0 25 ha as such revenues associated with the pldl program including the subsidy were inadequate to improve livelihoods in 2015 income from agriculture amounted to just 10 20 of total household income table 11 for most pldl participating households the real improvement in livelihoods came from increased participation in non farm employment fig 5 based on the data from the face to face surveys up to 86 of peasants were hoping to obtain such employment while the improvement of livelihoods may have been one of the initial justifications for the pldl program initiative to develop new local industries would probably make a greater contribution to this objective 5 conclusion from 2006 2015 beijing and hebei province jointly promoted an agricultural engineering program the pldl program that was designed to increase water availability and improve household livelihoods in local farming communities this study has provided a wide ranging evaluation of outcomes in relation to energy efficiency environmental performance provision of ecosystem services as well as household financial and employment effects such multi faceted investigation is considered important because interventions designed to achieve one particular goal typically have wider environmental social and economic consequences the pldl program supported by government subsidies was considered successful in relation to its primary goal of increasing water availability as water resource depletion was almost halved for every ha of implementation the government subsidy was found to be influential in encouraging household participation however the small size of household farms and the small proportion of household revenues coming from agricultural production meant that the pldl program did little to directly improve household livelihoods in addition to increasing water availability the pldl program improved several of the environmental performance indicators assessed using lca however higher results for acidification potential and eutrophication potential were a concern highlighting the need to assess environmental performance comprehensively to avoid unintended burden shifting between environmental aspects in hindsight it can be seen that important environmental hotspots could have been addressed if the pldl program had provided peasant farmers with technological support in addition to a subsidy for participation nevertheless the aggregated lca results suggested that overall environmental performance was improved the pldl program could also be viewed as a success from the perspective that the monetarized ecosystem service benefits greatly exceeded the subsidy payment an important spillover benefit was that participating households were able to achieve greater participation in non farm employment which contributed to higher household incomes and poverty alleviation an important finding of this study is that an agricultural engineering program designed to alleviate water scarcity can have wide ranging environmental economic and social impacts acknowledgments we are grateful for grants from three

11554,the paddy land to dry land pldl program was a 10 year long 2006 2015 agricultural engineering program initiated jointly by beijing and heibei province that was designed to increase urban water availability and improve household livelihoods in local farming communities the program supported by government subsidy involved conversion of paddy oryza sativa to maize zea mays in this study a range of environmental social and economic indicators were used to evaluate the program in relation to its primary goal of saving water the program was considered successful with water consumption of maize production 47 lower the subsidy was also found to be influential in encouraging household participation however the small size of household farms and the small proportion of household revenues coming from agricultural production meant that the pldl program did little to directly improve household livelihoods environmental indicators assessed using life cycle assessment showed mixed results although most indicators improved some deteriorated namely acidification and eutrophication potential this highlights the importance of assessing environmental performance comprehensively to avoid burden shifting important environmental impacts could potentially have been reduced if the program had provided additional technological support to farmers nevertheless the aggregated lca results suggested that overall environmental performance was improved the pldl program could also be viewed as a success from the perspective that the monetarized ecosystem service benefits greatly exceeded the subsidy payment an important spillover benefit was that participating households were able to achieve greater participation in non farm employment which contributed to higher household incomes and poverty alleviation an important finding of this study is that an agricultural engineering program designed to alleviate water scarcity can have wide ranging environmental economic and social impacts keywords ecological engineering energy efficiency life cycle assessment environment load economic performance social impact 1 introduction water resource shortage and water security are important global issues of the 21st century food production social stability and sustainable development can all be impacted by water scarcity and climate change is further exacerbating the problem in many places chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 lal 2015 he and cai 2016 while china has 2 81 103 billion m3 yr 1 of freshwater supply the 6th most in the world sun 2015 sun et al 2016 two critical factors that threat china s sustainable development are uneven distribution of water resources and shortage of water per capita to illustrate the yangtze river basin and south china has 36 of national farmland and 80 of national water resources in contrast north china with around 40 of farmland has a mere 8 of water resources sun et al 2016 the global per capita availability of water resource is 8 800 m3 but only 2 200 m3 in china and 500 m3 in north china huang et al 2012 the per capita availability of water was 100 m3 in 2014 in beijing bwa 2015 which is far below the internationally recognized threshold of 1 000 m3 huang et al 2012 water scarcity is threatening china s sustainable development especially that of north china therefore china must adopt appropriate strategies to address this issue since 1995 a variety of projects have been implemented in the cities of zhangjiakou and chendeng to address water scarcity and improve the livelihoods of the people liu 2012 zheng et al 2013 lin et al 2016a b these cities are located to the north of beijing and are affiliated administratively with hebei province fig 1 these programs include water saving agricultural practices sewage treatment improved watershed management and the paddy land to dry land pldl program among others the pldl program was implemented over ten years 2006 2015 and involved three counties containing 15 213 households and 6 866 ha of farmland however various concerns have been raised about the pldl program farmers were financially incentivized to replace rice cultivation with maize however the adequacy of the compensation and overall impact on livelihoods has been questioned dong and li 2007 liu 2012 liang et al 2013a b cui 2014 liu et al 2015 lin et al 2016a b some researchers concluded that the project improved water quantity and quality zheng et al 2013 dai and zhang 2014 however liu 2012 and liang et al 2013a b reported that the implementation of the pldl program increased loading of n p and pesticides to water zheng et al 2013 opined that increases in loading of nutrients has resulted in other environmental risks such as high concentration of nitrates in groundwater soil acidification acid rains greenhouse gas ghg emissions etc what has been lacking is a comprehensive evaluation of the pldl program spanning the ten year period and utilizing multiple environmental and economic indicators the comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of agricultural ecological engineering projects covering both the environmental and human dimensions has become a popular research themes for example sartori et al 2005 assessed energy use and economics of a 3 year crop rotation for conservation and organic farming in ne italy oudshoorn et al 2011 explored the sustainability of future organic dairy farming systems in denmark by evaluating the economic and environmental consequences of three scenarios at the farm level andersson et al 2015 made a social ecological analysis of ecosystem services in two different farming systems based on the life cycle assessment lca approach kamali et al 2017 evaluated a number of environmental economic and social issues for different soybean farming systems in southern brazil wang et al 2014 used lca to evaluate two different winter wheat summer maize rotation models synthesis of these and other studies suggested that a comprehensive assessment combining environmental and economic aspects can be beneficial wang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 kamali et al 2017 the objective of this study was to make a comprehensive assessment of the pldl program based on multiple methods and models firstly an energy efficiency analysis was conducted using an input output methodology secondly lca was used to estimate environmental effects of the transition from cultivation of paddy rice to maize thirdly the economic benefits of the changed systems were estimated using an input output balance approach fourthly both ecological service value and social impact were analyzed based on surveys involving questionnaires and interviews finally an integrated indicator was created to assist in interpretation of the overall change 2 the study area and method 2 1 the study area and pldl program the pldl program was implemented in various districts of beijing and in three counties of hebei province chicheng fengning and luanping beijing located in the north china plain ncp covers an area of 16 411 km2 and had a population of 21 7 million in 2015 bjmbs 2014 2016 in 2014 the total water resource consumption was 3 75 billion m3 and the per capita water resource availability was just 94 m3 bwa 2015 in 2020 and 2030 the total water resource requirement is projected to increase to 5 3 109 m3 and 5 6 109 m3 respectively sun 2015 miyun reservoir is the only surface water resource for domestic water and the chaobai river watershed is the main source the upstream of chaobai river watershed covers the three counties affiliated to chengde and zhangjiakou city the downstream is in beijing and enters miyun reservoir fig 1 eventually the river runs into the ocean in tianjin district from 2006 2015 beijing and hebei province jointly promoted the pldl program in the three counties along the chaobai river the peasants were advised to substitute cultivation of spring maize for traditional paddy rice and to gradually reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides as an incentive the government paid peasants an economic subsidy of 6 750 yuan ha 1 yr 1 8 yuan 1 us in 2006 and from 2008 the amount was increased to 8 250 yuan ha 1 yr 1 in 2015 the beijing government declared the program a success but decided to focus on other water saving initiatives instead of the pldl program thus the pldl program was terminated in order to obtain background data on the pldl program interviews were conducted with local government authorities including the bureau of agriculture and water authority in each of the three counties following this questionnaire surveys were conducted in november 2015 with households in the townships involved for further comparative analysis a supplementary investigation was undertaken in march of 2016 the survey included both participating and non participating households each questionnaire included two parts one part related to farming inputs and production levels and the other part was focused on attitudes to the pldl program and lifestyle changes that had occurred as a result of it 2 2 energy assessment an energy balance approach was used to evaluate the energy use efficiency eue of the paddy and maize farming systems the total energy inputs were comprised of nonrenewable inorganic and renewable organic energy and were calculated by eq 1 nonrenewable energy inputs included use of machinery diesel electricity irrigation canals chemical fertilizers and pesticides seed and labor were regarded as renewable energy inputs the outputs included grain and straw table 1 describes the input output inventory and energy coefficients used 1 etotal enonrenewable erenewable 2 3 life cycle assessment lca is a tool to systematically evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle iso 2006a b four stages are involved namely goal and scope definition life cycle inventory lci analysis life cycle impact assessment lcia and result interpretation 2 3 1 goal and scope definition the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the environmental performance of paddy rice and maize grown in the regions where the pldl program was implemented in this study a cradle to farm gate approach was adopted brentrup et al 2001 2004 this included all inputs from the cradle such as raw materials extraction to the farm gate namely the harvested crop all of the operational inputs were taken into account including agricultural machine production diesel fuel irrigation canals fertilizers pesticides electricity etc the system was divided into two subsystems 1 the off farm system included raw materials extraction processing and transportation as well as the production of farming inputs and their packaging and transportation and 2 the on farm system that included the emissions from farming practices fig 2 nemecek et al 2011 described three ways of expressing agricultural lca results in relation to commodity output farm revenues and per area farmed for this study it was deemed relevant to report results according to commodity output per mg product and per land area ha 2 3 2 life cycle inventory the data describing resources used and crop production were collected from the questionnaire survey table 1 uses of farm machinery seeder rotary cultivator harvester etc were calculated following liu 1982 and chen 2011 data relating to the production maintenance of farm machinery and the fuel use and emission related to their operation was sourced from li 2014 yao et al 2011 and gao et al 2013 data relating to irrigation infrastructure came from li et al 2011 emissions of ghgs e g co2 ch4 and n2o nox and so2 were computed for the use of chemicals pesticides electricity seeds and diesel fuel according to the methods described by liang 2009 for the on farm subsystem direct emissions from the application of fertilizers were calculated using relevant local coefficients these emissions included ammonia nh3 nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 emissions to air as well nitrate and phosphorous p emissions to water emissions of heavy metals into agricultural soil surface water and groundwater were also taken into account the coefficients of nh3 volatilization for paddy and spring maize were 15 4 and 24 7 of nitrogen n fertilizers use respectively yang et al 2015 ju et al 2009 regarding n2o and ch4 emissions the magnitude of such emissions are influenced by fertilizer use and soil typology duan et al 2014 ju et al 2009 harada et al 2007 hu et al 2013 xu 2011 xu 2011 and duan et al 2014 reported that the coefficients of n2o n emission of paddy and maize production were 0 8 and 0 9 of total n fertilizer input respectively based on local field experiments in the study area by chen et al 1992 and zhang et al 1994 a methane emission from paddy of 17 5 mg m 2 h 1 was used similarly it was assumed that 8 45 and 15 12 of n fertilizer inputs to paddy and maize production were leached into water in the form of total n yang et al 2015 ju et al 2009 coefficients of p loss in paddy and maize production were 1 1 and 1 of p fertilizer use respectively wang et al 2006 li and jin 2011 zhang et al 2015a b the potential impacts of heavy metals i e cu cd zn pb were evaluated from the input output balance the sources of inputs of heavy metals included irrigation water fertilizers and atmospheric deposition removals of heavy metal from the system included the harvesting of grains and straws yang 2013 zhang 2013 the household surveys identified that all crop residues were removed from the farmland because of scarcity of the pertinent data it was assumed that except for heavy metal removed with irrigation water grain and straw the remainder entered into agricultural soil the coefficients of pesticide residues released into the atmosphere water and soil were 10 1 and 43 of the active ingredients used respectively van calker et al 2004 2 3 3 life cycle impact assessment lcia the life cycle impact assessment lcia was performed to further understand the environmental relevance of the lci data the approach to impact assessment normalization and weighting was adopted from liang 2009 and liang et al 2017 the environmental impact categories assessed included non renewable energy requirement nrer water resource depletion wrd global warming potential gwp acidification potential ap eutrophication potential ep human toxicity potential htp fresh aquatic toxicity potential fatp and terrestrial toxicity potential ttp table 2 the particular impact assessment models used were taken from literature liu 1982 deng and wang 2003 brentrup et al 2001 huijbregts et al 2000 for ghg emissions the 100 year global warming potentials published by the ipcc 2007 were used 2 3 4 life cycle interpretation life cycle interpretation was the final step of the lca methodology this included contribution analysis to identify important life cycle stages and contributing factors as well as comparison of alternative scenarios blengini and busto 2009 2 4 economic assessment the economic assessment compared the farm related profitability of households that participated in the pldl program against households that did not for participating households income included the government subsidy for pldl participation data were obtained from the household survey section 2 1 and the results were expressed per ha of farmland cultivated in general most of the households depended on their own labor for performing farm operations therefore the cost of labor was not taken into account according to chinese custom eq 2 was used to calculate and analyze the two scenarios 2 edp emp esp epp where edp is the difference between participating pldl households and non participating households emp is the net profit of maize production esp is the subsidy from the government and epp is the net profit of paddy production 2 5 ecological and social assessment there are many potential ecological service benefits associated with modified farming systems this study focused on water availability and ghg emission reduction as the ecological services most relevant to the pldl program following eq 3 3 eν σ emi epi pi where eν is the total value of ecological service emi and epi are the amount of ith ecological service of maize and paddy production respectively pi is the market price of ith ecological service in addition two indicators were used to assess the social impact one indicator was the change in household income including agricultural and non agricultural sources of income the second indicator was participation in employment outside the agricultural sector 2 6 comprehensive assessment in order to assist interpretation of the combined impact of the pldl program an integrated indicator was also calculated following zhong 2014 the integrated indicator included four components eue weighting lca score net profit and ecological service value the indicator was calculated using eq 4 4 ic σ w vmi vpi ri where ic is the integrated indicator w is the coefficient of weighting and the value of the four aspects is 0 25 respectively zhong 2014 vmi and vpi are the values of ith impact of maize and paddy production respectively and ri is the reference value of ith impact the reference values were the average values across the period 2009 2011 which for eue weighting lca score net profit and ecological service value were 2 64 liu et al 2013 7 15 liang 2009 6 195 yuan ha 1 luo et al 2017 and 6 114 yuan ha 1 li et al 2016 respectively 3 results 3 1 energy efficiency analysis tables 3 and 4 present the energy inputs and outputs for paddy and maize as well as several energy use efficiency ratios in comparison with the paddy production the total energy inputs for maize production were 23 3 lower in 2006 and 18 5 lower in 2015 however for both crops the total energy inputs increased from 2006 to 2015 largely due to the increased input of inorganic materials i e machinery diesel and chemical fertilizers inorganic energy inputs were the primary source of total energy inputs for paddy production inorganic energy inputs represented 88 2 of total energy inputs in 2006 and 90 4 in 2015 for maize the proportion of inorganic energy input was even higher 92 0 in 2006 and 94 6 in 2015 in contrast the increase in grain yield of paddy and maize were only 1 8 for both crops consequently the ratios of total outputs grain and straw combined total inputs inorganic and organic energy combined decreased over time from 5 2 to 4 5 for paddy and from 8 0 to 6 6 in the case of maize table 4 these trends indicate that the eue improved as a result of cultivating maize rather than paddy however the eue of production of both crops decreased over time as increases in resource inputs achieved only modest yield gains 3 2 environmental performance and assessment based on lca 3 2 1 resource consumption for both paddy and maize production the off farm subsystem was responsible for 96 1 of the total nrer of which n production accounted for 68 3 77 9 of the total followed by machinery electricity and pesticides table 5 in comparison to paddy the nrer of maize production was 12 8 13 6 lower in regards to the off farm subsystem seed production was the major factor contributing to wrd followed by n fertilizer production however the off farm subsystem made only a minor contribution to total wrd with the on farm subsystem contributing 96 1 98 5 mainly in the form of irrigation water use in contrast to paddy production the water consumption of maize production was 47 lower and the quantity of water saving was 380 m3 per mg of grain due to the change of planting model and reduction in the irrigation ratio 3 2 2 characterization of pollutant emissions comparing paddy and maize production the lca results were mixed table 6 fig 3 lca impact category indictor results for maize were 75 7 80 2 lower for gwp 25 1 36 7 lower for htp 28 2 55 4 lower for fatp and 23 6 81 8 lower for ttp however for maize the results for ap and ep were both higher than paddy the gwp of paddy and maize were both dominated by field emissions from the on farm subsystem and n fertilizer production in the off farm subsystem fig 4 from 2006 to 2015 the total gwp per mg of paddy rice increased from 2 686 to 2 733 kg co2 eq the gwp per mg maize also increased over this period from 531 to 663 kg co2 eq the pldl program therefore achieved large reductions in ghg emission as farmlands changed from being a source to a sink for ch4 hu et al 2013 harada et al 2007 the ap of paddy and maize production was primarily due to nh3 volatilization in the on farm subsystem increased n fertilizer inputs from 2006 to 2015 led to increasing ap in both systems however the coefficient of nh3 volatilization of maize was higher than that of paddy and consequently the total ap increased from 2006 to 2015 similar to ap ep was mainly related to the on farm subsystem and dominated by nh3 volatilization and n leaching in comparison with the paddy production the total ep per mg maize increased by 27 5 and 36 8 in 2006 and 2015 respectively pesticides and heavy metals were the two major factors contributing to htp fatp and ttp in this study all the three toxicity types for paddy were higher than those for maize because of higher pesticide herbicide and fungicide use with higher toxicity ingredients as well as higher heavy metal loadings through irrigation of the paddy system in contrast to 2006 both paddy and maize production systems used more pesticides in 2015 however the toxicity of the active ingredients was lower in 2015 consequently htp fatp and ttp decreased over time fig 4 presents the toxicity profiles of both crop production systems the htp of paddy and maize systems were dominated by heavy metals with regards to fatp for the period from 2006 to 2015 the toxicity potentials of both systems from heavy metals remained relatively stable table 7 and pesticide use was the major factor in 2006 due to the use of higher toxicity pesticides e g triazophos atrazine acephatemet the total fatp was 74 4 and 33 6 kg 1 4 dcbeq per mg of paddy and maize production respectively by limiting the use of these higher toxicity pesticides the values of fatp were lower in 2015 at 8 74 and 9 46 kg 1 4 dcbeq per mg of paddy and maize grain respectively with regards to ttp the toxicity potential to the terrestrial ecosystem large decreases were observed from 2006 to 2015 for the same reasons outlined above table 7 3 2 3 environment indices during the normalization step each of the environmental impact category indicator results was divided by china s per capita environmental impact value for 2010 table 8 wrd ep and fatp were identified as the three major environmental burdens of paddy and maize production in 2006 and 2015 the normalized results for wrd were 1 81 and 1 77 for paddy and 0 95 and 0 93 for maize production whereas the values for maize were lower compared to paddy production these values were still close to that of the per capita annual wrd burden the normalized results for ep for paddy and maize increased from 1 39 and 1 77 in 2006 to 1 58 and 2 16 in 2015 respectively this trend suggests that the risks of eutrophication were 139 177 158 and 216 of the average per capita value for china in 2010 in contrast the normalized results for fatp of paddy and maize decreased from 17 5 and 7 8 in 2006 to 3 9 and 2 8 in 2015 nonetheless risks of freshwater toxicity impacts remain high for weighting the normalized results were multiplied by the corresponding weighting factors and all values were summed the single score results in 2006 and 2015 were 2 81 and 1 16 for paddy and 1 44 and 0 95 for maize respectively table 8 in comparison with paddy the total environmental burden of maize production was 48 8 lower in 2006 and 17 7 lower in 2015 3 3 economic performance net profit from paddy and maize production in 2006 was 13 425 and 16 275 yuan ha 1 respectively table 9 the government subsidy of 6 750 yuan ha 1 for maize production under the pldl program made an important contribution to the 2 850 yuan ha 1 higher net profit obtained with maize however by 2015 the results had changed with maize production achieving a lower net profit even with the government subsidy the lower net income of maize production was attributed to the increase in market value of rice from around 2 000 3 000 yuan mg 1 from 2006 to 2015 in comparison the market value of maize only increased from 1 500 to 1 800 yuan mg 1 during the same period 3 4 ecological and social performance the ecological service values per ha under the pldl program were 17 457 yuan in 2006 and 17 353 yuan in 2015 table 10 regarding social metrics in 2006 households received similar revenues regardless of whether or not they participated in the pldl program households participating in the pldl program received a slightly greater proportion of their income from sources outside agriculture 78 4 compared to 75 9 table 11 fig 5 however by 2015 households participating in the pldl program had a much higher income 26 270 yuan compared to 22 355 yuan with a markedly higher participation in non agricultural employment 89 1 of income compared to 80 9 3 5 comprehensive performance the integrated indicator of pldl performance was 1 33 in 2006 and 0 78 in 2015 the overall impact of the pldl program remained positive over time however the benefits have been in overall decline with declines in the environmental dimension the most prominent table 12 4 discussion 4 1 energy efficiency in agro ecosystems the eue of maize production was higher than that of paddy which was a benefit of the pldl program however the eue of both systems declined over time as increasing resource inputs achieved only modest gains in yields the intensification of agricultural production was also shown to raise other environmental concerns as evidenced by the lca indicator results table 7 reducing energy inputs and improving eue can both support sustainable development and these are common objectives throughout the world khan and hanjra 2009 alluvione et al 2011 chen et al 2008 deike et al 2008 erdal et al 2007 gelfand et al 2010 hülsbergen et al 2001 jose 2009 lin et al 2016a b liu 1982 1984 swanton et al 1996 ye and li 2002 in china ju et al 2006 zheng et al 2013 and ju and gu 2014 all reported that the levels of agricultural inputs tend to be higher in the north china plain region than in other districts liu 1984 1984 zhang et al 2015a b and yuan and peng 2017 also undertook integrated eue assessments in relation to china s agricultural production earlier studies arising from the 1980s made suggestions about increasing energy inputs to increase eue however by the 1990s and in some high yielding districts crop yields stagnated despite additional input of both organic and inorganic energy chen et al 2008 ju et al 2006 liang et al 2011 liu et al 2010a b ye and li 2002 many studies have shown that crop intensification follows a trend of diminishing marginal returns beyond a critical threshold lin et al 2016a b khan and hanjra 2009 ye and li 2002 liu et al 2013 analyzed the c efficiency of china s intensive farming over the last five decades the present study used these data and evaluated the energy input and eue of china s agro ecosystems between 1952 and 2010 table 13 several major changes are highlighted firstly the proportion of inorganic energy input has greatly increased from 1 4 to 71 2 of total energy input with corresponding decreases in the proportion of organic energy input secondly the eue has increased greatly since 1950 taking 1952 as the baseline value of 1 the growth rate of total input and grain output are shown in fig 6 the results show that from 1952 to 1980 the growth rates of total input and grain production were in proportion however this relation was broken during the 1990s compared to 1952 the total energy input in 1990 increased 4 4 times while the grain production increased only by 3 8 times the difference was further enlarged and reached 7 7 and 4 5 times in 2010 fig 6 this trend implies that since the 1990s the rate of increase of eue has lagged behind that of the energy input in china studies from zhang et al 2015a b and yuan and peng 2017 confirm this trend compared to other countries there still exists great space to increase the eue of agriculture for china in this study the eue of paddy production ranged from 2 60 to 3 05 table 4 and the result from lu et al 2010 was 2 26 these results for paddy systems in china are higher than has been reported in india 0 79 united states 1 42 and iran 1 52 but far lower than that of philippines 5 51 pimentel 2009 pishgar komleh et al 2011 quilty et al 2014 as for maize production the corresponding value was between 3 35 and 4 19 table 4 which is higher than iran 1 81 and almost equal to turkey 3 8 and united states 4 11 but far lower than italy 8 6 tabar et al 2010 alluvione et al 2011 canakci et al 2005 pimentel 2009 thus for china and for many other countries improving eue of agro ecosystems remains an important goal 4 2 environmental performance of agro ecosystems the lca approach used in the present study was different than that adopted by other researchers because the full range of capital items machinery production and maintenance irrigation facilities etc was included cai et al 2011 huang et al 2011 li et al 2010 liang et al 2009 lu et al 2012 the results showed that some indicators were lower under the pldl program e g nrer wrd gwp and htp however other indicators remain a priority for impact reduction e g ap ep and fatp while pldl program realized the goal of water saving the quality of water was unlikely to have improved high inputs of chemical fertilizer were the major reasons contributing to ap and ep according to contract signed by local governments and households participating in the pldl program fertilizer and pesticides use should have been reduced the reality however was that the quantity of fertilizer used has increased over the last ten years the increase in fertilizer use was necessitated by a decrease in the fertility of farmland soil when maize was substituted for paddy and increase in incidence of pests and pathogens by absence of flooding and the lack of application of sludge provided by the river under these conditions increasing the input of fertilizers and pesticides was the commonly observed response from peasant farmers with limited technical knowledge and technological support the pldl program provided a financial subsidy to encourage participation however the pldl program may have achieved better environmental outcomes if the local farmers had also been provided greater levels of technological support since the 1990s lca has become an important assessment tool in agro ecosystem research anderson et al 1994 kramer et al 1999 brentrup et al 2001 2004 the methodology was also introduced in china during the late 1990s and has since been used widely wang et al 2006 cheng et al 2011 huang et al 2013 li et al 2010 liang 2009 liang et al 2013a b liu et al 2010a b lu et al 2012 xia and yan 2011 wang et al 2014 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 however most researchers have primarily addressed single impact categories e g gwp ap and ep however an important concern in lca is to avoid burden shifting the lca results for the pldl program illustrate how initiatives designed to address one environmental concern can unintentionally exacerbate others as such greater application of lca where a full range of environmental indicators are used is encouraged both in china and elsewhere 4 3 eco efficiency ee and payment for ecosystem service pes ee is an expression of efficiency of an economic activity with regard to its impact upon nature it is represented by the ratio product or service value environmental influence oecd 1998 environmental impacts for ee calculations usually include energy use resource use water use and ghg emissions among others verfaillie and bidwell 2000 using the lca approach to evaluate the ee of a production system product or service has become popular in recent years basset mens et al 2009 bleischwitz 2003 kulak et al 2013 2016 müller et al 2015 pelletier and tyedmers 2008 thanawong et al 2014 for the pldl program the lca results demonstrated improvement in some environmental indicators and deterioration in others tables 7 and 8 that said the weighted lca results suggested that the overall environmental performance was improved table 8 as such it can be concluded that the pldl program resulted in an overall improvement in eco efficiency in china payment for ecosystem services pes is typically called ecological compensation dong and li 2007 lin et al 2016a b liu 2012 zheng et al 2013 the subsidy provided to households for participation in the pldl program was a type of ecological compensation designed to increase water availability in this study two ecosystem services were monetarized gwp and wrd table 10 in 2006 and 2015 the value of ecological service from the pldl program amounted to 17 457 and 17 353 yuan ha 1 yr 1 of which the subsidies were only 6 750 and 8 250 yuan ha 1 yr 1 respectively as such the subsidy was less than 50 of the estimated value and a case could be made for continuation of the program cui 2014 lin et al 2016a b zheng et al 2013 during the 2015 interviews many of the households participating in the pldl program indicated that the market differential between paddy rice and maize meant that without the government subsidy they would have likely returned to cultivating paddy rice naturally any withdrawal from the pldl program would lead to increased pressure on local water resources 4 4 employment opportunities and economic revenue in the regions where the pldl program was implemented the typical family farm holding is rather small 0 25 ha as such revenues associated with the pldl program including the subsidy were inadequate to improve livelihoods in 2015 income from agriculture amounted to just 10 20 of total household income table 11 for most pldl participating households the real improvement in livelihoods came from increased participation in non farm employment fig 5 based on the data from the face to face surveys up to 86 of peasants were hoping to obtain such employment while the improvement of livelihoods may have been one of the initial justifications for the pldl program initiative to develop new local industries would probably make a greater contribution to this objective 5 conclusion from 2006 2015 beijing and hebei province jointly promoted an agricultural engineering program the pldl program that was designed to increase water availability and improve household livelihoods in local farming communities this study has provided a wide ranging evaluation of outcomes in relation to energy efficiency environmental performance provision of ecosystem services as well as household financial and employment effects such multi faceted investigation is considered important because interventions designed to achieve one particular goal typically have wider environmental social and economic consequences the pldl program supported by government subsidies was considered successful in relation to its primary goal of increasing water availability as water resource depletion was almost halved for every ha of implementation the government subsidy was found to be influential in encouraging household participation however the small size of household farms and the small proportion of household revenues coming from agricultural production meant that the pldl program did little to directly improve household livelihoods in addition to increasing water availability the pldl program improved several of the environmental performance indicators assessed using lca however higher results for acidification potential and eutrophication potential were a concern highlighting the need to assess environmental performance comprehensively to avoid unintended burden shifting between environmental aspects in hindsight it can be seen that important environmental hotspots could have been addressed if the pldl program had provided peasant farmers with technological support in addition to a subsidy for participation nevertheless the aggregated lca results suggested that overall environmental performance was improved the pldl program could also be viewed as a success from the perspective that the monetarized ecosystem service benefits greatly exceeded the subsidy payment an important spillover benefit was that participating households were able to achieve greater participation in non farm employment which contributed to higher household incomes and poverty alleviation an important finding of this study is that an agricultural engineering program designed to alleviate water scarcity can have wide ranging environmental economic and social impacts acknowledgments we are grateful for grants from three
