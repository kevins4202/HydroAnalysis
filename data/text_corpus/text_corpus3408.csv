17040,the presence of soluble iron and phosphorus in wastewater sludge can lead to vivianite scaling this problem is not often reported in literature most likely due to the difficult identification and quantification of this mineral it is usually present as a hard and blue deposit that can also be brown or black depending on its composition and location from samples and information gathered in 14 wastewater treatment plants worldwide it became clear that vivianite scaling is common and can cause operational issues vivianite scaling mainly occurred in 3 zones for which formation hypotheses were discussed firstly iron reduction seems to be the trigger for scaling in anaerobic zones like sludge pipes mainly after sludge thickening secondly ph increase was evaluated to be the major cause for the formation of a mixed scaling a majority of oxidized vivianite with some iron hydroxides around dewatering centrifuges of undigested sludge thirdly the temperature dependence of vivianite solubility appears to be the driver for vivianite deposition in heat exchanger around mesophilic digesters 37 c while higher temperatures potentially aggravate the phenomenon for instance in thermophilic digesters mitigation solutions like the use of buffer tanks or steam injections are discussed finally best practices for safe mixing of sludges with each other are proposed since poor admixing can contribute to scaling aggravation the relevance of this study lays in the occurrence of ironphosphate scaling while the use of iron coagulants will probably increase in the future to meet more stringent phosphorus discharge limits graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wwtp iron phosphate iron reduction centrifuge anaerobic equipment heat exchanger 1 introduction wastewater treatment greatly developed in the last decades in 2014 about 95 of the european population eu 28 was connected to a wastewater collection system which accounts for around 517 million people european commission 2017 additionally nutrient removal is practiced in 84 5 of the wastewater treatment plants wwtp through tertiary treatment european commission 2017 the current direction is to evolve from the standard wastewater treatment practise towards a water resource recovery facility solon et al 2019 specifically sludge is increasingly used to produce biogas while phosphorus can be recovered for example as struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o in installations where phosphorus is removed biologically partlan 2018 originally the interest in struvite was not based on its recovery but on the prevention of its presence as scaling the occurrence of struvite scaling in wwtps is long time recognised in literature rawn et al 1939 doyle et al 2002 and is a plague it can cause pipe diameter reduction thus increasing the required pumping energy and eventually pipe replacement amongst other problems doyle and parsons 2002 struvite scaling is predominantly reported in the dewatering units after digestion in wwtps using enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr as phosphorus is released and solubilized during sludge digestion another phosphorus mineral vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o can also cause scaling problems in wwtps it provokes the same operational problems as described for struvite and can involve important maintenance costs vivianite recently received increased attention since it was recognised as the major phosphorus mineral in iron coagulated digested sludge wilfert et al 2016 and could be recovered by magnetic separation prot et al 2019 due to its quick oxidation after exposure to air and light vivianite scaling usually presents a blueish colour facilitating an easy identification čermáková et al 2013 mccammon and burns 1980 nonetheless we believe that vivianite scaling is not always identified due to the general lack of information about its occurrence moreover it is often misattributed to struvite scaling which explains why vivianite scaling received little attention in the past twenty years ago wwtp professionals started to report vivianite scaling in their installations marx et al 2001 shimada et al 2011 bjorn 2010 but this type of scaling was never studied in depth the understanding and prevention of vivianite scaling is a relevant topic due to the current lack of information and to the expected increased use of iron salts in the future indeed chemical phosphorus removal cpr or a combination of cpr and ebpr can achieve lower phosphorus levels in the effluent than ebpr alone el bestawy et al 2005 kumar et al 2018 additionally precipitation is proposed as effective way to make wwtp s energy neutral or energy producing therefore the number of wwtps relying on partial cpr strategy is expected to increase as it is already the case in north west europe espp 2019 to comply to more stringent legislations for the effluent quality furthermore high iron dosages are essential to maximize the amount of phosphorus that is recoverable magnetically prot et al 2020 and it is important to ensure that it is compatible with vivianite scaling prevention it is possible that vivianite scaling is already widely occurring nowadays but without being identified vivianite identification is challenging without advanced techniques like mössbauer spectroscopy since it can be highly oxidized and therefore become amorphous prot et al 2020 we reviewed the information available in literature for cases of wwtps experiencing vivianite scaling since the data on vivianite scaling was limited in literature information was also gathered from wwtps suffering from vivianite scaling in total data from 14 wwtps worldwide were collected to get a better overview of the situation after identifying the preferential places for scaling thorough analyses of a number of scaling samples were carried out the possible formation mechanisms were discussed to finally evaluate several scaling mitigation strategies 2 materials methods 2 1 wwtps studied in total information from 14 wwtps has been gathered some of them presenting several places where scaling was observed fig a1 depicts the location of these wwtps and the type of information gathered 2 2 analyses the scaling samples were not protected from oxygen and were stored for up to 6 months before analysis visual observations suggested that the centre of the samples was relatively protected from oxidation since it kept the same colour even after 6 months of storage while vivianite oxidation is characterized by darkening of the samples from light to dark blue čermáková et al 2013 mccammon and burns 1980 however it cannot be completely excluded that the samples partly oxidized during their storage before the measurements the samples were analysed to determine their elemental composition and their phase composition in addition ph iron and phosphorus measurements were carried out in the sludge line of the wwtp of hoensbroek nl of waterschapbedrijf limburg using hach lange kits chemical equilibrium modelling was conducted with the software visual minteq the equilibrium reactions considered are detailed in appendix b 2 2 1 elemental composition at first 30 50 mg of powdered sample was added to 10 ml of ultrapure hno3 64 5 70 5 from vwr chemicals in a teflon vessel the powder was then digested in an ethos easy digester from milestone equipped with an sk 15 high pressure rotor the digester reached 200 c in 15 min ran at this temperature for 15 min and cooled down for 1 h the elemental composition of the digestates was determined via inductively coupled plasma perkin elmer type optima 5300 dv equipped with an optical emission spectroscopy icp oes an autosampler perkin elmer type esi sc 4 dx fast was used and the data were processed with the software perkin elmer winlab32 the rinse and internal standard solution were respectively 2 of hno3 and 10 mg l of yttrium 2 2 2 solid characterization firstly a thin slice of each sample was cut with a scalpel for light microscope and sem edx observation the microscope used was a leica mz95 equipped with a leica dfc320 camera the sem edx apparatus was a jeol jsm 6480 lv scanning electron microscope sem equipped with an oxford instruments x act sdd energy dispersive x ray edx spectrometer the accelerating voltage was 15 00 kv for a working distance of 10 mm the samples were covered with a 10 nm layer of gold using a jeol jfc 1200 fine coater to make the surface electrically conductive the software used was jeol sem control user interface for the sem and oxford instruments aztec for the edx data processing then the samples were pulverized in a mortar for xrd mössbauer spectroscopy and carbonate analysis due to organization changes in tu delft 2 xrd devices were used the first one was a panalytical x pert pro diffractometer with cu kα radiation 5 80 2θ step size 0 008 the peaks assignment was realized with the software origin pro 9 samples measured with this device venlo hoensbroek the second device was a bruker d8 advance diffractometer bragg brentano geometry and lynxeye position sensitive detector with cu kα radiation 10 80 2θ step size 0 008 the peaks assignment was done with bruker software diffracsuite eva vs 5 2 samples measured with the second device spokane county amsterdam blue plains turku in addition mössbauer spectroscopy was performed on a selection of samples to study the iron compounds even those with an amorphous nature which is not possible with xrd alone the powdered samples were first introduced in plastic rings sealed with kapton foil and epoxy glue and wrapped in aluminium foil if necessary carbon powder was added to the sample to maintain a maximum iron quantity of 17 5 mg of fe cm2 transmission 57fe mössbauer absorption spectra were collected at 300 k with conventional constant acceleration spectrometer using a 57co rh source one sample from turku was also analysed at 4 2 k for further analysis of the fe iii phases velocity calibration was carried out using an α fe foil the mössbauer spectra were fitted using the mosswinn 4 0 program klencsár 1997 and based on previous fittings of sludge samples as described in wilfert et al 2018 and prot et al 2020 literature data on vivianite scaling are scarce and not detailed enough to understand the scaling formation mechanisms therefore 10 wwtps experiencing vivianite scaling were directly contacted to gather additional information and samples table 1 the collection of these data allowed the identification of the preferential vivianite scaling zones the possible formation mechanisms were then proposed and correlated to the composition of the vivianite scaling samples when necessary more detailed analysis was carried out at the wwtps to challenge the proposed formation mechanisms 3 results discussion from the data collected at 14 wwtp s fig a1 five possible locations for vivianite scaling formation in a wwtp were identified these locations are discussed in the following sections in the anaerobic pipes and units before sludge digestion 3 1 around the dewatering centrifuges for undigested sludge 3 2 in the heat exchangers around anaerobic digestion 3 3 in zones where sludge with different characteristics are mixed together 3 4 and in digesters as settled particles 3 5 the possible mechanisms of formation of vivianite scaling are discussed resulting in a proposal for strategies to prevent vivianite related scaling 3 1 anaerobic zones our dataset indicates that one preferential place for vivianite scaling are pipes and storage tanks for waste sludge where sludge is maintained under anaerobic conditions for several hours in the wwtp of blue plains scaling was observed in several units downstream of the sludge thickener screens flow meters valves centrifuge feed the wwtp of venlo also experiences scaling before the thermal hydrolysis process thp installation mainly in the pipes and sludge cutter after the thickener at the wwtps of hoensbroek and bosscherveld a blueish scaling was observed in the pipes carrying the sludge from the thickener to the dewatering centrifuge this scaling provoked operational issues forcing the shut down of centrifuges for cleaning while restricting the flow in the pipeline pathak et al 2018 xrd indicated that no other crystalline phases than vivianite were present in hoensbroek and venlo while some quartz and siderite were also found in blue plains in 2 out of 6 samples pathak et al 2018 while xrd is limited to the analysis of the crystalline phases mössbauer spectroscopy allows to also quantify any amorphous fe compounds mössbauer spectroscopy revealed that vivianite was accounting for 72 and 82 of the total weight of the scaling in hoensbroek and venlo respectively the unidentified part of the scaling could be other iron species like fe iii phases or a low spin fe ii phase typically fes minerals according to mössbauer spectroscopy these species could be iron oxides resulting from the ageing of vivianite roldan et al 2002 in the case of hoensbroek the 4 of sulphur exactly accounts for the iron fraction not bound to vivianite if formation of fes is assumed which is also in line with edx results fig 1 the vivianite present in the scaling can be impure and also include mg and ca in its structure as noticed by rothe et al 2016 and seitz et al 1973 therefore we hypothesize that the scaling was actually composed of more than 72 hoensbroek and 82 venlo value obtained assuming no iron substitution of a vivianite like mineral even though the different scalings do not have the exact same composition we believe that the cause of their formation is identical the scaling could result of the formation of stable nuclei on the surface on a surface e g wall of a pipe through primary heterogeneous nucleation being the onset for further crystal in this case scaling growth mersmann 2001 alternatively agglomeration could be triggered by deposition of small vivianite crystals resulting from previous nucleation on the surface of the equipment or pipe turbulence in the pipe or equipment near the walls increases collision probabilities and forms an important factor for this mechanism mersmann 2001 fluid mechanics in the pipe system have been studied to discuss this point the main findings are presented in this section while the detailed calculation can be found in appendix c in hoensbroek the activated sludge is brought to a thickener with a residence time of 13 h before being pumped toward a centrifuge at a flow of 18 7 m3 h via three consecutive pipes d1 0 2 m l1 30 m d2 0 1 m l2 5 m d3 0 08 m l3 16 m considering a power law model approach the flow regime is laminar in pipe 3 since re 2100 ratkovich et al 2013 so the flow is also laminar in pipe 1 and 2 since they have bigger diameters this is in line with what is reported in literature where sludge flow in pipes is usually considered laminar slatter 2004 haldenwang et al 2012 a collision formation mechanism seems unlikely in a laminar regime since it would require some transversal vivianite particle movement moreover light microscope sem observations of the sample from hoensbroek and venlo show continuous crystalline matrix rather than agglomeration of particles indicating that a growth mechanism from soluble phosphorus and fe2 is more likely fig 1 since between the thickener and the dewatering units the conditions are anaerobic fe iii will be reduced to fe ii while phosphate could be released from the biomass according to rate measurements by wang et al 2019 it takes around 1 day to reduce the majority of the fe iii present in activated sludge to fe ii around 2 days are required to release the biggest fraction of the phosphate from the phosphate accumulating organisms pao s during thickening according to janssen et al 2002 considering that the typical sludge retention time in a thickener is a few hours the release of phosphorus and iron will still be ongoing while the sludge will leave the thickener allowing scaling growth in iron coagulated sludge like in hoensbroek phosphorus is not only found in pao s but also bound to iron it is complicated to evaluate separately the phosphorus released from pao s and from fe iii p minerals the study of the vivianite scaling formation was realized assuming that iron is the limiting compound since phosphorus release mechanisms are more complex according to wang et al 2019 iron reduction follows a first order kinetic with k 0 05 h 1 so the quantity of iron reduced in the pipes is proportional to the sludge retention time for low retention times from the sludge velocity profile in the pipes the zone next to the pipe wall will present a much smaller velocity and so higher fe2 concentration than in the bulk from this we can assume that the formation of vivianite follows a wall mechanism rather than a bulk mechanism bigger pipe will see more iron being reduced compared to smaller pipes due to higher retention times however a big part of the fe2 produced will not have time to diffuse to the pipe wall and will precipitate in the bulk not causing scaling appendix c to summarize the morphology of the scaling and the laminar flow regime suggest that the scaling found in the sludge transport or handling units under anaerobic conditions follows a growth mechanism rather than an agglomeration mechanism we hypothesize that the iron reduction due to the anaerobic conditions is the driver for the formation of the scaling fig 2 both low diffusion velocities and high iron concentrations near the walls suggest that a wall mechanism growth is favoured these observations imply that larger diameter pipes may be better to use due to their lower wall area volume ratio even though they present higher sludge retention times iron reduction and phosphorus release will strongly contribute to the formation of vivianite scaling and are unavoidable however iron reduction should be almost complete after 24 h according to wang et al 2019 this means that allowing a fermenting sludge to rest in a unit bearing a high volume surface ratio eg a buffer tank for a day could allow all the iron to be reduced and the main part of the vivianite to form in the bulk of the sludge instead of creating problematic scaling in the units downstream a small fraction of the vivianite could still scale on the wall of the buffer tank but this should be manageable and is easily accessible for cleaning such buffer tank is used in the wwtp of dokhaven for a different purpose than scaling prevention vivianite scales were observed in this tank but it is not a major issue since it only requires a yearly cleaning no scaling problem downstream from this tank has been reported indicating that addition of such buffer tank may be a valid option for scaling prevention 3 2 dewatering units from the information collected the worst occurrence of scaling was around centrifuges used for the dewatering of undigested sludge the wwtps of hoensbroek bosscherveld and turku dewater their thickened sludge by centrifugation before sending it for disposal the scaling occurs in turku wwtp in the centrifuge and centrate pipe and is manageable with a manual cleaning being necessary 2 3 times per year costing around 2000 month information obtained from the wwtp the situation is more dramatic in hoensbroek and bosscherveld where important build up of scaling mainly composed of vivianite based compounds was observed in the centrifuge the centrate box and the centrate pipe it forces a stoppage and cleaning of the centrifuge every 1 2 weeks and a yearly replacement of the centrate pipe in hoensbroek scaling formation also happened in the wwtp of the blue plains in and downstream of the pre dewatering centrifuge before thp build up in the centrifuge increased torque and vibration obliging operators to put the equipment out of service for manual cleaning pathak et al 2018 scaling formation in the centrifuge and the centrate pipes caused the most severe operational problems compared to the other scaling location since the scaling observed in the centrifuges and in the centrate pipes are similar in their elemental composition and microscopic structures unpublished data detailed analyses were only carried out on the samples found in the centrate pipes the samples were quite different from the scaling found in the heat exchangers and the sludge transport pipes since the deposits were softer and mainly brown black instead of blue the scaling from blue plains hoensbroek and bosscherveld presented a similar elemental composition with 26 31 of fe 10 11 of p and 1 4 of ca which is close to the composition of vivianite 33 of fe 12 of p table 1 the samples were much more xrd amorphous than the scaling found in other sections of the wwtps but xrd still managed to identify vivianite impure in hoensbroek and as a minor fraction in blue plains pathak et al 2018 microscopic observations of these three samples revealed a structure with brown black and occasional blue layers suggesting a mix of species with vivianite not being the major compound fig 3 surprisingly edx showed a homogeneous distribution of iron and phosphorus across the samples the mössbauer spectroscopy study of the centrate sample from hoensbroek confirmed the presence of 23 of vivianite accounting for only 30 and 25 of the iron and phosphorus in the sample respectively the 70 of remaining iron is present in fe iii minerals according to mössbauer spectroscopy based on the elemental composition close to the one of vivianite we believe that vivianite originally formed and progressively oxidized centrifuges are not protected from air intrusion transforming into metavivianite fe2 fe3 2 po4 2 oh 2 6h2o and then santabarbaraite fe3 3 po4 2 oh 3 5h2o the structure of the scaling from bosscherveld supports this hypothesis it presents a blue layer vivianite on the most freshly formed side of the scaling and brown black fe p containing material possibly metavivianite and santabarbaraite deeper in the scaling fig 3 additionally the edx analyses revealed a homogeneous iron and phosphorus distribution across the entire sample oxidation of vivianite leads to the progressive destruction of its crystalline structure making the newly formed minerals undetectable by xrd dormann and poullen 1980 pratesi et al 2003 the mössbauer signals of the oxidation products of vivianite are close to the one observed in this study feiii δ 0 35 0 43 mm s qs 0 5 0 9 mms s according to dormann and poullen 1980 but are overlapping with the signal of iron oxides making it impossible to be attributed to metavivianite or santabarbaraite with certainty strengite is another possible fe iii p mineral but the conditions in the centrifuge are not favourable for its formation wilfert et al 2015 pathak et al 2018 the sample from turku is different in its composition 39 of fe 4 of p and 1 of ca appearance major orange phase minor black phase and is really fragile fig 3 room temperature mössbauer spectroscopy indicates that it is entirely composed by fe iii species excluding the presence of vivianite and metavivianite and contains ferrihydrite layered iron hydroxide could be an intermediate since they are formed by oxidation of fe oh 2 and inclusion of anions and later form ferric oxyhydroxides under further oxidation refait et al 1998 phosphate adsorption alone cannot explain the 5 of phosphorus present in the sample since it would suggest a capacity 5 times higher mg of p g of fe than engineered fe adsorbents kumar et al 2019 xrd indicated that the sample was mainly amorphous and could contain a small quantity of goethite which agrees with roldan et al 2002 stating that vivianite oxidation results in the formation of poorly crystalline fe iii oxides a polymorph of goethite the 4 2 k mössbauer spectroscopy measurement which allows fe iii phases speciation reveals that a mix of 23 santabarbaraite and 77 ferrihydrite is possible fig 4 and appendix h the scalings found in centrate pipes are mainly amorphous and rich in phosphorus and oxidized fe the major compounds seems to be oxidation products of vivianite metavivianite and santabarbaraite while fe iii oxides hydroxides are also present except for turku s sample where fe iii oxides hydroxides are the main fraction a ph increase favours both the precipitation of vivianite and iron oxides hydroxide and could be the main mechanism explaining the formation of scaling around the centrifuge indeed the ph increased by 0 3 during centrifugation in the wwtp of blue plains pathak et al 2018 and hoensbroek the effect of ph on ferrihydrite precipitation is straightforward since its solubility directly depends on the third power of the oh activity schwertmann 1991 the si of vivianite is proportional to the square of the activity of po4 3 which is increasing with the ph liu et al 2018 during centrifugation co2 stripping occurs due to the turbulences and the contact with air which triggers the observed ph increase battistoni et al 1997 this rise of ph is also the main mechanism triggering struvite scaling in post digestion dewatering centrifuges doyle and parsons 2002 taking into account the composition of the sludge liquor just before centrifugation in hoensbroek p 8 6 ppm fe2 27 4 ppm fe3 6 91 ppm ph 6 9 ionic strength 0 02 an increase to ph 7 22 signifies a si increase from 5 41 to 6 28 and 5 48 to 5 80 for vivianite and ferrihydrite respectively the values of si are high which can be explained by an overestimation of fe2 3 in the sample this overestimation is due to small colloidal iron particles going through the pores of the 0 45 µm filter we experimentally confirmed this but at a later moment when the way of operation of the wwtp changed since iron reduction is a relatively slow process compared to the instantaneous ph increase during centrifugation we consider that a certain steady state toward vivianite formation is established before centrifugation the concentrations of iron and phosphorus were decreased assuming vivianite and fe oh 2 formation to match the equilibrium si calculated above 5 41 and 5 48 such equilibrium conditions at ph 7 22 are for p 5 1 ppm fe2 17 7 ppm fe3 3 4 ppm resulting in the formation of 28 3 mg l of vivianite and 5 3 mg l of ferrihydrite it is clear that even a small ph increase can have an important effect on the precipitation of vivianite and ferrihydrite from these calculations it appears that the scaling would be composed of a majority of vivianite which reinforces our hypothesis that vivianite was initially formed and oxidized making it complicated to trace a second mechanism could also explain the formation of fe iii oxides since the centrifuge is not protected from air intrusion the soluble fe2 could be oxidized triggering the formation of poorly soluble fe oh 3 detailed calculations in appendix d reveal that fe ii oxidation is too slow to explain significant formation of fe iii to produce fe oh 3 it seems therefore that this mechanism is much less important compared to vivianite formation which is confirmed by the information collected from the wwtps the centrate scaling from hoensbroek blue plains and bosscherveld containing a high quantity of fe p species require regular cleaning while the one in turku mainly iron oxide hydroxide only needs to be removed twice a year the unique composition of turku s sample may be explained by the high fe p molar ratio 1 75 used in this wwtp the reduction in the fe2 concentration in the liquid phase of the sludge to the centrate 27 4 to 6 5 ppm is much larger when compared to the reduction in the phosphorus concentration 8 6 to 4 7 ppm and cannot be explained by the formation of vivianite the authors believe that this is due to an overestimation of the soluble iron before centrifugation as discussed above additionally the extreme mixing conditions in the centrifuge may promote scaling formation indeed the flow regime before the centrifuge is laminar not allowing an optimal mixing of the ions while centrifugation creates turbulent conditions yousuf and frawley 2018 also showed that increased shear stress lowers the secondary nucleation formation of crystals in the presence of parent crystals mersmann 2001 threshold by increasing the collision between particles the presence of existing scaling and rough surface also promotes secondary nucleation from the information collected it appears that scaling formation around centrifuges is mainly caused by a ph increase through co2 evolution in the centrate chamber and in a smaller extent by the oxidation of the soluble fe2 fig 5 the large shear forces created by centrifugation can aggravate the scaling formation stripping some co2 in a tank before centrifugation to increase the ph would initiate controlled vivianite formation in the bulk and may reduce the scaling formation allowing a longer time under anaerobic conditions for the sludge before centrifugation should also lead to a reduction of soluble phosphorus and iron concentration the addition of a buffer tank after the thickener could be a combined solution for the scaling around the centrifuge and in the anaerobic zones discussed in 3 2 no vivianite scaling was reported in post digester centrifuges indicating that a longer residence time could indeed be a suitable solution since the ph increase is due to co2 stripping creating a co2 saturated atmosphere in the centrifuge could theoretically be an option to prevent it more research needs to be undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of all these options counterintuitively a higher iron phosphorus molar ratio in the sludge may also reduce vivianite scaling formation a higher iron dosing reduces the quantity of phosphorus present in the soluble phase reducing the quantity of phosphorus available for precipitation therefore the ph increase observed during centrifugation would provoke less vivianite scaling formation for example the iron dosage in turku is high fe p 1 75 and the scaling only needs to be removed 2 3 times per year on the contrary wwtps dosing less iron fe p 1 14 in hoensbroek and 0 65 in bosscherveld need to remove the scaling every 1 2 weeks 3 3 heat exchangers from the information gathered from wwtps and supported by literature it appears that sludge heat exchangers are a common place for vivianite scaling to occur in the case of the wwtps of lübeck ejby mølle and amsterdam a blue and hard scale was present in the sludge heat exchanger used for the heating of the mesophilic anaerobic digester a similar situation was reported in literature in several other wwtps inside and downstream of the digested sludge heat exchanger in dallas shimada et al 2011 in the heat exchanger around the acid phase digestion in derby bjorn 2010 and in the heating loop in back s river wwtp marx et al 2001 problems at higher temperatures especially in pasteurization units have also been reported by buchanan et al 2014 panter et al 2013 and reusser 2009 in the wwtp of blue plains and venlo scaling was found in the heat exchanger used to cool down the sludge after thp the seven scalings found in heat exchangers used to warm up the sludge for mesophilic and thermophilic digestion were all reported to be vivianite by laboratory analysis in literature not specified but probably xrd and elemental analysis by visual observation in lübeck no sample was available only picture and by xrd in amsterdam and ejby mølle the scaling of amsterdam was further studied by mössbauer spectroscopy which confirmed the presence of vivianite as 68 in weight likely underestimated due to its partial oxidation the macroscopic and microscopic observations of the scaling from amsterdam show a crystalline hard and blue scale that seems to be purer no other phase than vivianite visually observed than the scaling found in sludge pipes or dewatering units fig 6 from the pictures available the scalings from lübeck and ejby mølle seem to have similar characteristics this supposed high purity is supported by the elemental composition of the sample from amsterdam 30 of fe 13 of p and only 2 of mg and 1 of ca as inorganic impurities it is interesting to note that mg2 and ca2 could be part of the structure of vivianite by substituting fe2 rothe et al 2016 seitz et al 1973 the scale formed in the heat exchanger after thp at blue plains wwtp presents a similar elemental composition with 32 of fe 12 of p 1 of mg and 1 of s however this sample is more fragile and composed of two main phases a major blue phase and an orange one fig 6 mössbauer spectroscopy results confirmed that the blue phase is vivianite which accounts for 72 of the scaling weight 75 of the total fe the remaining 25 of iron are fe iii species according to mössbauer spectroscopy and could be a mix of iron oxides hydroxides and metavivianite santabarbaraite the scaling found after thp in venlo was black and had a completely different composition 12 of p 10 of ca 9 of fe 2 5 of mg and 1 of s no vivianite was present according to microscopic observations from the on site observations described above temperature seems to promote vivianite scaling formation both when the sludge is heated up and cooled down this is in line with the finding of al borno and tomson 1994 who showed that vivianite solubility evolves hyperbolically in function of the temperature fig 7 their results indicate that vivianite was the most soluble around 30 35 c which is close to the temperature of operation of a mesophilic digester 37 c the flow rate in heat exchanger is usually quite high 60 m3 h for amsterdam wwtp for example which together with their geometry spiral shape corrugated tubes promotes turbulences alfa laval brochure 2020 spiralex brochure 2020 in order to prevent solid settling and thermal decomposition of organics lines 1991 if the flow is turbulent a homogeneous temperature distribution can be expected in the bulk of the sludge according to guo 2020 only a very thin layer of sludge near the wall the boundary layer will have a lower velocity and so higher temperature than the bulk as opposed to the more gradual velocity gradient existing for laminar flows appendix c the exact temperature of the wall has not been calculated since full description of the thermal situation was not the objective of this study from the information we collected the digested sludge is brought typically from 30 c to 38 c by a water stream decreasing from 60 to 55 c according to fig 7 the solubility product constant pksp of vivianite slightly increases from 35 738 to 35 766 between 30 c and 38 c it translates into the precipitation of a maximum 0 28 mg of vivianite per litre of sludge for a typical iron coagulated digested sludge considered in appendix e p 30 ppm fe2 15 ppm is 0 05 ph 7 considering the flowrate of the sludge in the heat exchanger of amsterdam wwtp 60 m3 h it corresponds to the precipitation of 16 8 g of vivianite per hour in one heat exchanger it seems unrealistic that all the vivianite formed in the heat exchanger would scale so this value is likely overestimated it is important to mention that iron was dosed in the sludge heating loop of the wwtp of amsterdam which surely contributed to scaling formation even though the turbulent flow regime suggests a bulk mechanism it is interesting to study what can happen in the boundary layer of a heat exchanger at the exit of the considered counter current heat exchanger the temperature of the water is 60 c while the temperature of the sludge is 38 c assuming that the wall temperature is the average of the temperature of the sludge and the heating water 8 times more vivianite 2 17 g l of sludge could potentially form at the wall at 50 c compared to the bulk at 38 c in derby wwtp peaks to 85 c of the heating water where observed and believed to aggravate the scaling which would lead to potential formation of 4 96 mg l of vivianite considering a wall temperature of 60 c fig 7 suggests that vivianite is more likely to form in the exit part of the heat exchanger where the sludge is the warmest which was observed by reusser 2009 the situation could be worse when the sludge is brought at higher temperature 55 c heating up sludge from 30 c to 55 c potentially produces 12 times more vivianite 3 4 mg l compared to heating up from 30 c to 38 c temperatures higher than 55 c cause severe vivianite scaling issues particularly in heat exchanger of pre pasteurization plants panter et al 2013 and of a specific thermophilic digester configuration reusser 2009 salehin et al 2019 did not find vivianite presence in digested sludge after thp by xrd and concluded that vivianite formation was hindered by thp which suggests that vivianite scaling would not occur after thp however our mössbauer spectroscopy measurements revealed that vivianite accounted for 18 of the total solids in the post thp digested sludge of blue plains wwtp showing the possibility for vivianite to form in the cambi installation of blue plains wwtp sludge after thp is cooled down from 160 to 41 c first by pressure reduction from steam release followed by dilution with process water and then with a heat exchanger it can be hypothesized that the vivianite scaling observed was formed in the colder sections of the heat exchanger with wall temperature 32 c according to fig 7 vivianite scaling in the cooling heat exchanger after thp could then occur in the cold sludge region while the warmer region should be scale free in the case of venlo wwtp thp is followed by thermophilic digestion at 55 c it is unlikely that the sludge temperature decreases below 32 c in the boundary layer under these conditions so it seems logical that no vivianite scaling was found there from the different hot spots identified vivianite scaling in the heat exchanger was the most commonly reported in literature table 1 it could be due to the fact that vivianite in heat exchangers is generally more recognisable clean hard and blue scale more accessible compared to pipe inspection and causing immediate operational issues temperature losses as observed by shimada et al 2011 and reusser 2009 while the scaling in the heat exchanger was manageable in most of the installations using mesophilic digestion it seems that it can be more severe in installation bringing sludges at higher temperatures vivianite scaling was observed in both tubular and spiral heat exchanger lübeck wwtp so it is complicated to say which type of heat exchanger would cause less trouble using steam injection instead of contact heat exchangers to promote bulk precipitation is sometimes used and could be an interesting alternative to reduce scaling buchanan et al 2014 panter et al 2013 however it involves more energy and on site production of boiled feed water making this strategy more complicated to apply in general maintaining a low and constant temperature difference between the sludge and the heating water to avoid high wall temperature seems to be the best solution to mitigate vivianite scaling reusser 2009 bjorn 2010 but is more complicated at thermophilic temperatures iron salt addition or sludge admixing see 3 5 in the heat exchanger loop can aggravate the problems further 3 4 sludge admixing an additional point that requires attention to control scaling formation is the way the different sludges are mixed together wastewater treatment produces different streams of sludge that will be brought together typically for pre dewatering or digestion those sludges have different characteristics ph temperature concentration of fe2 and po4 3 and when they are brought together the saturation index si of the mix can potentially be higher than the index of the individual sludges this can be particularly the case when an already fermented sludge is mixed with a relatively fresh sludge when a sludge ferments ph drops vfa production fe2 increases dissolution of iron precipitates and po4 3 increases poly phosphate from pao s hydrolysis the difference of temperature between sludges can also be a factor triggering vivianite scaling in dallas wwtp digester feed was periodically incorporated to recirculation sludge shimada et al 2011 which can aggravate the problem due to an increase of the saturation index because of influences on composition ph fe2 po4 3 and temperature similar mixing issues in addition to an increased ph due to co2 stripping were believed to aggravate vivianite scaling in back river wwtp heating loop marx et al 2001 to conclude mixing of different sludges can trigger or aggravate vivianite scaling to prevent or at least mitigate vivianite scaling it is important to minimize the ph temperature and concentration differences between sludges that are mixed this could be done by preferring continuous feed at a lower flowrate over big periodical feed flows more importantly the place where the mixing occurs should be wisely chosen the mixing of sludge should preferably happen in a unit where the volume to area ratio is high to favour bulk precipitation the use of buffer tanks to allow the majority of the vivianite to precipitate seems ideal on the contrary we do not recommend to mix sludges in or before a unit where the surface volume ratio is high e g in the case of in line mixing in pipes heat exchanger etc 3 5 digester vivianite formation is promoted under anaerobic conditions due to the release of phosphate and the reduction of fe ii and anaerobic digesters are therefore a preferential formation site wilfert et al 2018 vivianite scaling could happen on the walls of digesters similarly to struvite but should not be so problematic due to the high volume area ratio of digesters the authors think that the settling of vivianite particles in digesters is not likely to happen since vivianite particles have the same density as quartz but are usually smaller 100 150 μm maximum we assume that digester mixing is generally engineered in a way that it prevents settling of quartz and similarly settling of vivianite moreover vivianite settling was never reported as an issue in any of the numerous digesters bearing vivianite in their sludge sampled by our team in previous studies wilfert et al 2018 blue plains wwtp digester withdrawal contains some vivianite but does not accumulate not creating issues however the wwtp of spokane county experiences problems in its anaerobic digesters due to the accumulation of a dark sand like material suspected to be vivianite fig 8 each digester is mixed with an external draft tube designed to pull from the centre of the bottom section and feed at the top but that needs to be reversed when too much material has accumulated additional mixing is provided by an internal jet mixing ring located at the bottom of each digester this jet mixing system has experienced clogging potentially also caused by material accumulation this accumulation obliges the wwtp to drain the bottom of the digesters on a daily basis losing a part of the valuable microbial community and involving heavy maintenance on the contrary to previously discussed scaling problems the issue in spokane county digesters was the settling of vivianite particles not the deposition of a continuous vivianite layer this case was investigated to confirm the presence of vivianite understand the cause of the settling and evaluate the uniqueness of this situation the digester withdrawal is composed of a majority of fe 32 and p 9 with 2 of ca as the main other inorganic element mössbauer spectroscopy indicated that 45 of the sample is vivianite and may contain non detected oxidation products of vivianite metavivianite and santabarbaraite since 37 of the phosphorus is still not attributed xrd detected the presence of baricite mg fe 2 3 po4 2 8h2o that can be assumed to be impure vivianite and rhodochrosite mnco3 the later could in fact be siderite feco3 since mn is absent from the sample and siderite has a similar xrd pattern as rhodochrosite anthony et al 1990 also mössbauer spectroscopy detects 11 of a fe ii phase with hyperfine parameters similar to siderite medina et al 2006 the presence of siderite would also match with the 4 8 of co3 equivalent to 9 6 of feco3 detected by μgc data not shown the microscopic observations reveal that the majority of the sample was composed by blue particles presenting a fe p overlap fig 8 these particles showed similar structure sheets agglomerate as the vivianite particles found in digested sludge wilfert et al 2018 prot et al 2019 and 2020 but were free and more spherical a longer retention time in the digester could promote erosion the particles were not bigger 100 150 μm than the largest of the particles usually encountered in digested sludge the terminal settling velocity of a vivianite particle of 150 μm of diameter was evaluated to be 2 27 m h appendix f this velocity is smaller than the one produced by the digester mixing vertical velocity 20 m h so we would not expect the particles to settle however vivianite does settle and the turnover time for these digesters is 1 h which is in the high range compared to 4 digesters studied by meroney and colorado 2009 24 54 min suggesting a not sufficient mixing from a discussion with the operators of the digesters of spokane county the mixing system is unique and no other installations encountered similar settling problems to conclude the mixing design seems to be the major cause of the problem for the specific case of spokane county wwtp the addition of an alternative mixing system to the existing installation could provide sufficient mixing and appear to be the most efficient solution but could be costly and complicated the digester is emptied by an overflow at the top of the installation which may not be optimal in this situation since the sludge is not homogeneous discharging from a lower point in the digester could help preventing vivianite accumulation more generally it is interesting to note that working at higher solid content in a digester would increase the viscosity of the sludge and therefore lower the particle settling speed for example increasing the solid content from 2 5 solid content in spokane county wwtp to 5 would decrease the settling velocity from 2 27 to 0 28 m h appendix f lastly we noticed that vivianite was agglomerating on some particles in the digester withdrawal increasing their size and therefore their settling potential fig 8 accumulation of vivianite on sand particles in a fluidized bed reactor was already proven possible by priambodo et al 2017 to avoid this agglomeration solids and especially sand should consistently be removed before digestion not to be used as a centre of agglomeration for vivianite 3 6 evaluation of the findings from the information collected it seems that vivianite scaling in wwtps is occurring much more often than reported in literature from the five preferential scaling places studied three seems to be more common 1 the anaerobic pipes and units before sludge digestion 2 around the pre dewatering centrifuges treating undigested sludge and 3 in the heat exchangers around anaerobic digestion vivianite is usually the major component of the scaling in these three zones with fes and iron oxides hydroxides being minor phases in the zone 2 vivianite gradually oxidizes to turn into amorphous metavivianite and santabarbaraite the vivianite formation mechanism is different depending on the scaling place and can involve iron reduction ph increase or temperature changes different prevention solutions based on the formation mechanisms are proposed in table 2 a common prevention strategy is the use of commercial anti scalant which is not discussed in this study it appears that the way sludge streams with different characteristics are admixed e g raw sludge digested sludge is an aggravating factor of vivianite scaling it should be done in unit with high volume surface ratio like buffer tanks to promote bulk precipitation vivianite settling in digesters cannot be classified as a common issue since the case studied involved an unique mixing system that we believe is the cause of the problem so far vivianite scaling did not attract a lot of attention compared to struvite scaling since the importance of vivianite in wastewater treatment was only recently highlighted moreover vivianite scaling is often wrongly mistaken for struvite scaling while the presence of struvite scaling was never detected in this study it needs to be noted that struvite scaling is more likely to happen in wwtps using ebpr parsons and doyle 2002 while vivianite scaling should preferentially happen in wwtps dosing iron to remove phosphorus the absence of struvite scaling in the presence of iron can be explained by its lower solubility 6 31 10 5 m for pksp 12 6 than the one of vivianite 6 92 10 8 m for pksp 35 8 also vivianite oxidation leads to the formation of amorphous compounds that are more complicated to identify even mössbauer spectroscopy analysis the best option for vivianite quantification presents limitations especially due to an incomplete database on iron compounds in sludge iron addition may be favourable for energy production via enhanced primary settling and we discussed in prot et al 2020 that higher iron dosage is favourable for vivianite formation and thus for subsequent magnetic recovery we foresee that higher iron dosing will be more commonly applied in the near future for different reasons struvite scaling prevention sulphide control in biogas and to meet more stringent legislation requirement for phosphorus removal additionally higher iron dosing increases the share of phosphorus present as vivianite which can subsequently be recovered via magnetic extraction providing a new possible phosphorus recovery route prot et al 2019 2020 dosing more iron is not incompatible with vivianite scaling prevention since bigger quantities of iron dosed achieve lower soluble phosphorus more phosphorus chemically fixed thus less phosphate released from biomass reducing the phosphorus pool available for vivianite scaling vivianite scaling occurrence does not mean that the quantity of iron dosed needs to be adjusted but rather that it needs to be dosed better this study raises points of attention and proposes mitigation prevention solutions that should be evaluated in each specific case by the water utilities 4 conclusion the main conclusion of this study is that vivianite scaling is occurring more often than the lack of information in literature suggests three preferential scaling places could be identified each of them presenting a different vivianite formation mechanism firstly the reduction of ferric iron triggered the formation of crystalline vivianite in the sections where undigested sludge met anaerobic conditions eg thickened sludge pipes secondly co2 stripping occurring during centrifugation of undigested sludge caused a ph increase responsible for the formation of vivianite that could later oxidize to santabarbaraite thirdly the temperature dependence of the solubility of vivianite can drive the formation of vivianite scaling on the walls of the heat exchangers used for digested sludge heating additionally scaling prevention solutions were discussed in each case for example the use of an anaerobic buffer tank immediately after thickening would promote the formation of vivianite in the bulk of the sludge reducing the vivianite scaling issues in the pipes and centrifuges downstream the choice of the appropriate solution and the related cost analysis should be undertaken in each specific case since costs for maintenance and material vary depending on the wwtp design and location we believe that this work can be of interest for water authorities for vivianite scaling mitigation as well as for researchers investigating

c 1 power law parameters determination to describe the rheology of non newtonian fluids like sludge 3 models are typically used the power law model the bingham model and the herschel and bulkley ratkovich et al 2013 reviewed a number of articles dealing with sludge rheology modelling and concluded that none of these models was better than the others moreover all the 3 models often give a satisfying fitting of the data which is not surprising since their expression derive one from the other for this study the power law model will be used τ k d v d r n where τ is the shear stress in n m2 k is the fluid consistency coefficient in n sn m2 d v d r is the shear rate in s 1 n is the flow behaviour index dimensionless the constants k and n vary depending on the solid content temperature and state of digestion of the sludge cao et al 2016 they need to be determined by fitting the experimental data however no rheological measurements were done in the current study so the parameters will be estimated from literature data for sludges with similar properties tss 3 1 t 20 c undigested sludge and modelled with the power law from the experimental data of wei et al 2018 honey and pretorius 2020 füreder et al 2018 and rosenberg et al 2002 we estimate that the parameters will be in the range 0 2 0 4 for n and 2 100 for k we excluded some much higher k values found in rosenberg et al 2002 since it was in contradiction with the 3 other sources c 2 flow regime evaluation the piping system in hoensbroek can be visualized on fig c1 to determine the flow regime in the pipes the reynolds number derived from a power law modelling needs to be calculated r e ρ v 2 n d n k 8 n 1 where r e is the reynolds number for the power law model dimensionless k is the fluid consistency coefficient in n sn m2 n is the flow behaviour index dimensionless ρ is the density of the sludge in kg m3 d is the diameter of the pipe in m unless it has a very high solid content sludge has a similar density than water so is set at 1000 kg m3 for the following calculation considering the ranges for the n and k factor estimated above the reynolds number in the pipe 3 d3 0 08 m l3 16 m varies from 13 to 1679 signifying that the flow regime is laminar since re 2100 ratkovich et al 2013 this is in line with what is usually reported in literature where sludge flow in pipes is usually considered laminar slatter 2004 haldenwang et al 2012 moreover the velocity for a laminar turbulent transition is estimated at 1 5 2 0 m s honey and pretorius 2020 while the velocity in the pipe 3 is 1 0 m s considering that pipe 3 is the smallest of the three pipes a laminar flow should be observed in the 2 other pipes as well d1 0 2 m l1 30 m and d2 0 1 m l2 5 m c 3 vivianite scaling formation the authors consider that vivianite scaling could form in 2 ways by collision of the particles with the pipe wall and further agglomeration or by precipitation from the dissolved species following iron reduction in a boundary layer considering that the flow regime is laminar in the pipe system the first formation mechanism is unlikely since it would require some transversal vivianite particle movement from this point on the second mechanism is studied the pipe 3 at hoensbroek wwtp has been opened after 3 5 years of operation and a scaling layer of 0 55 cm had formed mössbauer spectroscopy indicates that 72 of the scaling is vivianite knowing the density of vivianite d 2 69 it means that 39 6 kg of vivianite scaling formed in the pipe 3 over 3 5 years 1 29 g h c 4 velocity profile in the pipes from simpson and janna 2008 the velocity profile in a circular duct for a non newtonian fluid following the power law has the following expression v r 3 n 1 n 1 1 r r n 1 n v where n is the flow behaviour index dimensionless and estimated before ranging on 0 2 0 4 v r is the velocity at the radius r r is the distance from the centre of the pipe 0 r r r is the internal radius of the pipe v is the average velocity in the pipe for further calculations n will be fixed at value of 0 3 c 5 iron reduction rate the sludge between the thickener and the centrifuge contains 1070 mg of iron and 560 mg of phosphorus per kg of sludge ts 3 1 under anaerobic conditions phosphate will be released from the polyphosphate accumulating organisms however in chemical sludge like in hoensbroek phosphorus is not only found in pao s but is also bound to fe wang et al 2019 observed that vivianite progressively formed during incubation of activated chemical sludge meaning that some phosphorus was made available for vivianite formation it is complicated to differentiate the phosphate released from pao s and from fep minerals therefore the estimation of the vivianite scaling formed will be evaluated assuming that iron reduction is the limiting factor the quantity of iron reduced can be calculated from the retention time in the different layer of the pipe according to wang et al 2019 iron reduction in sludge in anaerobic conditions is following a first order kinetic with k 0 055 h 1 this translates into the reduction of 561 mg of fe kg of sludge in the thickener during the residence time of 13 5 h which will be taken as the initial fe0 value for the subsequent iron reduction we neglect here the reduction occurring in pipes 1 and 2 due to very low retention time compare to the one in the digester we obtain the expression f e t f e 0 1 exp 0 055 t where fe t represents the quantity of iron reduced into fe2 after entering the pipe mg fe kg of sludge fe0 is a constant representing the reducible iron at the beginning of the pipe system which is worth 509 of fe kg of sludge after removing the 561 mg fe kg of sludge already reduced in the thickener t is the time elapsed since the sludge enters pipe h it also corresponds to the retention time of the sludge in the pipe at a radius r since the retention times in the pipes are relatively small compared to the iron reduction rate there is almost a linear relation between the quantity of iron reduced and the retention time therefore the iron reduced is inversely proportional to the velocity of the sludge from fig c2 it can be noticed that the velocity profile of the sludge in pipe 3 will create zones near the edge of the pipe where fe2 concentration will be higher and promote vivianite scaling formation this iron production in combination with the phosphorus release from the sludge will lead to higher saturation index next to the wall of the pipe than in the bulk fig c3 c 6 influence of the pipe diameter on vivianite scaling formation the evolution of the saturation index fig c3 suggests that the vivianite scaling formation is a wall mechanism happening near the edge of the pipe therefore one can assume that bigger pipe would be more favourable than smaller one since their wall area volume ratio is lower to confirm this hypothesis the iron reduction profile was studied for 3 pipes of same length 16 m and increasing diameter d1 0 2 m d2 0 1 m and d3 0 08 m from fig c4 it can be seen that a pipe with bigger diameter will logically allow more iron reduction due to an increased sludge retention time for further discussion we arbitrarily assume that vivianite scales in the zones where more than 1 ppm of fe2 is produced by reduction from fig c4 we can see that this corresponds to a distance to the wall of 13 5 1 4 and 0 7 mm for pipe of diameter 0 2 0 1 0 08 m respectively this is explained by the fact that wider pipe will have lower velocity and so bigger retention time allowing more sludge to be reduced however if the sludge has a higher retention time it also means that the flow will be lower thus creating less vivianite scaling in terms of weight for example there is 7 times more volume of the pipe 1 d1 0 2 m that will have fe 1 ppm compared to pipe 3 d3 0 08 m however there will be 43 times more sludge that will effectively be under condition where fe 1 ppm if the flow in the different sludge layer is taken into account table c1 similar conclusions can be drawn for limit iron concentration other than 1 ppm from these calculations and assuming that vivianite scales following a wall mechanism formation the use of big pipe seems to favour vivianite scaling formation due to the higher retention time thus higher iron reduction potential it is also important to take diffusion into consideration to verify if the fe2 atoms have time to reach the wall in their residence time in the pipe c 7 fe2 diffusion the time that a fe2 ion will take to reach the wall of the pipe depending on its position can be approximated with the einstein law of diffusion miller 1924 t x 2 2 d where t is the time for the particle to cover the distance x m x is the distance covered by the particle in the time t s d is the specific diffusion coefficient for the particle studied in the medium considered m2 s henry 1994 gives the diffusion coefficient of fe2 in water at 25c 7 19 10 10 m2 s 1 zhang et al 2016 observed that the diffusion coefficient of iodide in digested sludge was following a logarithmic relationship to the solid content in the sludge by extrapolating their data for the solid content of the sludge of hoensbroek we can estimate that the diffusion coefficient decreased by 7 times compared to pure water we estimate that the evolution of the diffusion coefficient will be the same for fe2 ions giving d 10 10 m2 s 1 considering the distance to the pipe wall where the quantity of iron reduced is equal to 1 ppm table c1 the time required for an atom of fe2 to diffuse to the wall would be 911 250 9800 and 2450s for the pipes 1 2 and 3 respectively this is much bigger than the retention time of 144 s for the sludge at this location of the pipe the distance to the pipe wall that would allow fe2 ions enough time to travel to the pipe wall are 0 28 0 35 and 0 7 mm for the pipes 1 2 and 3 respectively it suggests that even though more fe2 would be produced in bigger pipes due to higher sludge retention time a big part of the fe2 produced would not have time to diffuse to the pipe wall to produce scaling to summarize the morphology of the scaling and the laminar flow regime suggest that the scaling found in the pipes before dewatering units follow a growth mechanism rather than an agglomeration mechanism we hypothesize that the iron reduction due to the anaerobic conditions is the driver to the formation of the scaling the lower sludge residence time in bigger pipes allows more iron to be reduced potentially creating more scaling however both low diffusion velocity and higher iron concentration near the walls imply that a wall mechanism growth is possible these observations imply that bigger pipes may be better to use due to their lower wall area volume ratio according to wang et al 2019 iron reduction in sludge in anaerobic conditions is following a first order kinetic with k 0 055 s 1 this translates into the reduction of 561 and 1 5 mg of fe kg of sludge in the thickener residence time of 13 5 h and in the pipe system residence time of 3 4 min respectively assuming that all the iron reduced in the pipe scales and that 78 of the iron that scales does it as vivianite data from mössbauer spectroscopy 66 0 g of vivianite could form every hour in the pipe system this translates into the formation of 5 0 g of vivianite per hour in the small pipe section ø3 0 08 m l3 16 m when the pipe section before the centrifuge d3 0 08 m was opened in hoensbroek it revealed that the thickness of the scaling was 0 55 cm the pipe was opened in november 2019 3 5 years after being installed mössbauer spectroscopy indicates that 72 of the scaling is vivianite hypothesizing a uniform scaling formation on the entire pipe between the thickener and the centrifuge and knowing the density of vivianite d 2 69 1 39 g h of vivianite scaling forms this represents 28 of the value obtained above which suggests that a significant fraction of the iron reduced stays in the bulk appendix d the sludge reaching the dewatering units is anaerobic since it has usually been under anaerobic conditions for a couple of hours 13 h in hoensbroek for example since the solubility of fe ii compounds is higher than the one of fe iii compounds the equilibrium concentration of fe2 is also higher compared to the one of fe3 as noticed during on site measurements fe2 27 4 ppm fe3 6 91 ppm before centrifuge in hoensbroek during centrifugation the liquid fraction is separated from the sludge and comes in contact with oxygen so that fe2 can get oxidized to fe3 the freshly formed fe3 could immediately precipitate due to the lower solubility of fe iii compared to fe ii compounds the oxidation of fe2 is ruled by the following equation d f e 2 d t k o h 2 f e 2 p o 2 where f e 2 is the concentration of fe2 in mol l o h is the concentration of oh in mol l p o 2 is the partial pressure of o2 worth 0 2 atm in atmospheric conditions we assume here that the diffusion of the o2 is not limiting due to the important mixing k is the kinetic rate of the reaction in l2 mol 2 min 1 atm 1 according to sung and morgan 1980 k is worth 2 9 1013 l2 mol 2 min 1 atm 1 for an ionic strength of 0 02 m at a ph of 7 22 measured in the centrate and a p o 2 of 0 2 air environment in the centrifuge 4 1 ppm of fe2 would be reduced in 1 min which in the same order of magnitude than the retention time in hoensbroek centrifuge it seems like this mechanism would not be too important compared to vivianite formation which is confirmed by the information collected from the wwtps the centrate scaling from hoensbroek blue plains and bosscherveld containing a high quantity of fe p species require regular cleaning while the one in turku mainly iron oxide hydroxide needs to be removed only twice a year appendix e table e1 table h1 we consider here a typical digested sludge from a wwtp using cpr with iron the characteristics of the soluble phase of this sludge at 37 c are p 30 ppm fe2 15 ppm ph 7 is 0 05 m soluble phosphorus ph and is are average values obtained from prot et al 2020 and fe2 comes from the results from 4 digested sludge studied by wilfert et al 2018 the software visual minteq was used to determine the saturation index and the concentration of the species in function of the temperature the value of the pksp of vivianite was manually modified for each temperature considered following the relation from al borno and tomson 1994 pksp 234 205 12 242 6 t 92 510 logt at 37 c the saturation index for vivianite is 5 417 the conditions at 37 c are considered the equilibrium conditions since it is the usual temperature of digested sludge all the equilibrium concentrations showed in table e1 for the different temperatures were calculated to match si 5 417 as the equilibrium condition from the information we collected the digested sludge is brought typically from 30 c to 38 c which corresponds to a soluble concentration decrease of 0 03 and 0 1 ppm for p and fe2 respectively it corresponds to the formation of 0 28 mg l of vivianite appendix f rheological measurements were not carried out with the sludge of spokane county so the value of the apparent viscosity of digested sludge was obtained from literature review the digested sludge of spokane county has an average solid content of 2 2 5 literature indicates that the apparent viscosity of digested sludge ranging from 1 8 to 3 6 of solid varies from 0 035 to 0 5 pa s markis et al 2016 eshtiaghi et al 2012 goel et al 2004 baudez et al 2011 these values were taken for shear stresses around 100 s 1 since sludge is a shear thinning fluid its viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate markis et al 2016 eshtiaghi et al 2012 in a digester the shear rates are not homogeneous and are higher in the zones closer to the stirrer baudez et al 2011 for example show that the apparent viscosity of a 2 5 solid digested sludge decreases from 0 25 to 0 035 pa s for an increasing shear rate from 4 to 90 s 1 the shear rate during digestion cannot be too high to preserve the bacteria functioning jiang et al 2016 but high enough to maintain a proper mixing therefore we will consider a case where the shear rate is moderate and assume a viscosity of 0 1 pa s newton s law gives the terminal speed of a particle in

17040,the presence of soluble iron and phosphorus in wastewater sludge can lead to vivianite scaling this problem is not often reported in literature most likely due to the difficult identification and quantification of this mineral it is usually present as a hard and blue deposit that can also be brown or black depending on its composition and location from samples and information gathered in 14 wastewater treatment plants worldwide it became clear that vivianite scaling is common and can cause operational issues vivianite scaling mainly occurred in 3 zones for which formation hypotheses were discussed firstly iron reduction seems to be the trigger for scaling in anaerobic zones like sludge pipes mainly after sludge thickening secondly ph increase was evaluated to be the major cause for the formation of a mixed scaling a majority of oxidized vivianite with some iron hydroxides around dewatering centrifuges of undigested sludge thirdly the temperature dependence of vivianite solubility appears to be the driver for vivianite deposition in heat exchanger around mesophilic digesters 37 c while higher temperatures potentially aggravate the phenomenon for instance in thermophilic digesters mitigation solutions like the use of buffer tanks or steam injections are discussed finally best practices for safe mixing of sludges with each other are proposed since poor admixing can contribute to scaling aggravation the relevance of this study lays in the occurrence of ironphosphate scaling while the use of iron coagulants will probably increase in the future to meet more stringent phosphorus discharge limits graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wwtp iron phosphate iron reduction centrifuge anaerobic equipment heat exchanger 1 introduction

people european commission 2017 additionally nutrient removal is practiced in 84 5 of the wastewater treatment plants wwtp through tertiary treatment european commission 2017 the current direction is to evolve from the standard wastewater treatment practise towards a water resource recovery facility solon et al 2019 specifically sludge is increasingly used to produce biogas while phosphorus can be recovered for example as struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o in installations where phosphorus is removed biologically partlan 2018 originally the interest in struvite was not based on its recovery but on the prevention of its presence as scaling the occurrence of struvite scaling in wwtps is long time recognised in literature rawn et al 1939 doyle et al 2002 and is a plague it can cause pipe diameter reduction thus increasing the required pumping energy and eventually pipe replacement amongst other problems doyle and parsons 2002 struvite scaling is predominantly reported in the dewatering units after digestion in wwtps using enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr as phosphorus is released and solubilized during sludge digestion another phosphorus mineral vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o can also cause scaling problems in wwtps it provokes the same operational problems as described for struvite and can involve important maintenance costs vivianite recently received increased attention since it was recognised as the major phosphorus mineral in iron coagulated digested sludge wilfert et al 2016 and could be recovered by magnetic separation prot et al 2019 due to its quick oxidation after exposure to air and light vivianite scaling usually presents a blueish colour facilitating an easy identification čermáková et al 2013 mccammon and burns 1980 nonetheless we believe that vivianite scaling is not always identified due to the general lack of information about its occurrence moreover it is often misattributed to struvite scaling which explains why vivianite scaling received little attention in the past twenty years ago wwtp professionals started to report vivianite scaling in their installations marx et al 2001 shimada et al 2011 bjorn 2010 but this type of scaling was never studied in depth the understanding and prevention of vivianite scaling is a relevant topic due to the current lack of information and to the expected increased use of iron salts in the future indeed chemical phosphorus removal cpr or a combination of cpr and ebpr can achieve lower phosphorus levels in the effluent than ebpr alone el bestawy et al 2005 kumar et al 2018 additionally precipitation is proposed as effective way to make wwtp s energy neutral or energy producing therefore the number of wwtps relying on partial cpr strategy is expected to increase as it is already the case in north west europe espp 2019 to comply to more stringent legislations for the effluent quality furthermore high iron dosages are essential to maximize the amount of phosphorus that is recoverable magnetically prot et al 2020 and it is important to ensure that it is compatible with vivianite scaling prevention it is possible that vivianite scaling is already widely occurring nowadays but without being identified vivianite identification is challenging without advanced techniques like mössbauer spectroscopy since it can be highly oxidized and therefore become amorphous prot et al 2020 we reviewed the information available in literature for cases of wwtps experiencing vivianite scaling since the data on vivianite scaling was limited in literature information was also gathered from wwtps suffering from vivianite scaling in total data from 14 wwtps worldwide were collected to get a better overview of the situation after identifying the preferential places for scaling thorough analyses of a number of scaling samples were carried out the possible formation mechanisms were discussed to finally evaluate several scaling mitigation strategies 2 materials methods 2 1 wwtps studied in total information from 14 wwtps has been gathered some of them presenting several places where scaling was observed fig a1 depicts the location of these wwtps and the type of information gathered 2 2 analyses the scaling samples were not protected from oxygen and were stored for up to 6 months before analysis visual observations suggested that the centre of the samples was relatively protected from oxidation since it kept the same colour even after 6 months of storage while vivianite oxidation is characterized by darkening of the samples from light to dark blue čermáková et al 2013 mccammon and burns 1980 however it cannot be completely excluded that the samples partly oxidized during their storage before the measurements the samples were analysed to determine their elemental composition and their phase composition in addition ph iron and phosphorus measurements were carried out in the sludge line of the wwtp of hoensbroek nl of waterschapbedrijf limburg using hach lange kits chemical equilibrium modelling was conducted with the software visual minteq the equilibrium reactions considered are detailed in appendix b 2 2 1 elemental composition at first 30 50 mg of powdered sample was added to 10 ml of ultrapure hno3 64 5 70 5 from vwr chemicals in a teflon vessel the powder was then digested in an ethos easy digester from milestone equipped with an sk 15 high pressure rotor the digester reached 200 c in 15 min ran at this temperature for 15 min and cooled down for 1 h the elemental composition of the digestates was determined via inductively coupled plasma perkin elmer type optima 5300 dv equipped with an optical emission spectroscopy icp oes an autosampler perkin elmer type esi sc 4 dx fast was used and the data were processed with the software perkin elmer winlab32 the rinse and internal standard solution were respectively 2 of hno3 and 10 mg l of yttrium 2 2 2 solid characterization firstly a thin slice of each sample was cut with a scalpel for light microscope and sem edx observation the microscope used was a leica mz95 equipped with a leica dfc320 camera the sem edx apparatus was a jeol jsm 6480 lv scanning electron microscope sem equipped with an oxford instruments x act sdd energy dispersive x ray edx spectrometer the accelerating voltage was 15 00 kv for a working distance of 10 mm the samples were covered with a 10 nm layer of gold using a jeol jfc 1200 fine coater to make the surface electrically conductive the software used was jeol sem control user interface for the sem and oxford instruments aztec for the edx data processing then the samples were pulverized in a mortar for xrd mössbauer spectroscopy and carbonate analysis due to organization changes in tu delft 2 xrd devices were used the first one was a panalytical x pert pro diffractometer with cu kα radiation 5 80 2θ step size 0 008 the peaks assignment was realized with the software origin pro 9 samples measured with this device venlo hoensbroek the second device was a bruker d8 advance diffractometer bragg brentano geometry and lynxeye position sensitive detector with cu kα radiation 10 80 2θ step size 0 008 the peaks assignment was done with bruker software diffracsuite eva vs 5 2 samples measured with the second device spokane county amsterdam blue plains turku in addition mössbauer spectroscopy was performed on a selection of samples to study the iron compounds even those with an amorphous nature which is not possible with xrd alone the powdered samples were first introduced in plastic rings sealed with kapton foil and epoxy glue and wrapped in aluminium foil if necessary carbon powder was added to the sample to maintain a maximum iron quantity of 17 5 mg of fe cm2 transmission 57fe mössbauer absorption spectra were collected at 300 k with conventional constant acceleration spectrometer using a 57co rh source one sample from turku was also analysed at 4 2 k for further analysis of the fe iii phases velocity calibration was carried out using an α fe foil the mössbauer spectra were fitted using the mosswinn 4 0 program klencsár 1997 and based on previous fittings of sludge samples as described in wilfert et al 2018 and prot et al 2020 literature data on vivianite scaling are scarce and not detailed enough to understand the scaling formation mechanisms therefore 10 wwtps experiencing vivianite scaling were directly contacted to gather additional information and samples table 1 the collection of these data allowed the identification of the preferential vivianite scaling zones the possible formation mechanisms were then proposed and correlated to the composition of the vivianite scaling samples when necessary more detailed analysis was carried out at the wwtps to challenge the proposed formation mechanisms 3 results discussion from the data collected at 14 wwtp s fig a1 five possible locations for vivianite scaling formation in a wwtp were identified these locations are discussed in the following sections in the anaerobic pipes and units before sludge digestion 3 1 around the dewatering centrifuges for undigested sludge 3 2 in the heat exchangers around anaerobic digestion 3 3 in zones where sludge with different characteristics are mixed together 3 4 and in digesters as settled particles 3 5 the possible mechanisms of formation of vivianite scaling are discussed resulting in a proposal for strategies to prevent vivianite related scaling 3 1 anaerobic zones our dataset indicates that one preferential place for vivianite scaling are pipes and storage tanks for waste sludge where sludge is maintained under anaerobic conditions for several hours in the wwtp of blue plains scaling was observed in several units downstream of the sludge thickener screens flow meters valves centrifuge feed the wwtp of venlo also experiences scaling before the thermal hydrolysis process thp installation mainly in the pipes and sludge cutter after the thickener at the wwtps of hoensbroek and bosscherveld a blueish scaling was observed in the pipes carrying the sludge from the thickener to the dewatering centrifuge this scaling provoked operational issues forcing the shut down of centrifuges for cleaning while restricting the flow in the pipeline pathak et al 2018 xrd indicated that no other crystalline phases than vivianite were present in hoensbroek and venlo while some quartz and siderite were also found in blue plains in 2 out of 6 samples pathak et al 2018 while xrd is limited to the analysis of the crystalline phases mössbauer spectroscopy allows to also quantify any amorphous fe compounds mössbauer spectroscopy revealed that vivianite was accounting for 72 and 82 of the total weight of the scaling in hoensbroek and venlo respectively the unidentified part of the scaling could be other iron species like fe iii phases or a low spin fe ii phase typically fes minerals according to mössbauer spectroscopy these species could be iron oxides resulting from the ageing of vivianite roldan et al 2002 in the case of hoensbroek the 4 of sulphur exactly accounts for the iron fraction not bound to vivianite if formation of fes is assumed which is also in line with edx results fig 1 the vivianite present in the scaling can be impure and also include mg and ca in its structure as noticed by rothe et al 2016 and seitz et al 1973 therefore we hypothesize that the scaling was actually composed of more than 72 hoensbroek and 82 venlo value obtained assuming no iron substitution of a vivianite like mineral even though the different scalings do not have the exact same composition we believe that the cause of their formation is identical the scaling could result of the formation of stable nuclei on the surface on a surface e g wall of a pipe through primary heterogeneous nucleation being the onset for further crystal in this case scaling growth mersmann 2001 alternatively agglomeration could be triggered by deposition of small vivianite crystals resulting from previous nucleation on the surface of the equipment or pipe turbulence in the pipe or equipment near the walls increases collision probabilities and forms an important factor for this mechanism mersmann 2001 fluid mechanics in the pipe system have been studied to discuss this point the main findings are presented in this section while the detailed calculation can be found in appendix c in hoensbroek the activated sludge is brought to a thickener with a residence time of 13 h before being pumped toward a centrifuge at a flow of 18 7 m3 h via three consecutive pipes d1 0 2 m l1 30 m d2 0 1 m l2 5 m d3 0 08 m l3 16 m considering a power law model approach the flow regime is laminar in pipe 3 since re 2100 ratkovich et al 2013 so the flow is also laminar in pipe 1 and 2 since they have bigger diameters this is in line with what is reported in literature where sludge flow in pipes is usually considered laminar slatter 2004 haldenwang et al 2012 a collision formation mechanism seems unlikely in a laminar regime since it would require some transversal vivianite particle movement moreover light microscope sem observations of the sample from hoensbroek and venlo show continuous crystalline matrix rather than agglomeration of particles indicating that a growth mechanism from soluble phosphorus and fe2 is more likely fig 1 since between the thickener and the dewatering units the conditions are anaerobic fe iii will be reduced to fe ii while phosphate could be released from the biomass according to rate measurements by wang et al 2019 it takes around 1 day to reduce the majority of the fe iii present in activated sludge to fe ii around 2 days are required to release the biggest fraction of the phosphate from the phosphate accumulating organisms pao s during thickening according to janssen et al 2002 considering that the typical sludge retention time in a thickener is a few hours the release of phosphorus and iron will still be ongoing while the sludge will leave the thickener allowing scaling growth in iron coagulated sludge like in hoensbroek phosphorus is not only found in pao s but also bound to iron it is complicated to evaluate separately the phosphorus released from pao s and from fe iii p minerals the study of the vivianite scaling formation was realized assuming that iron is the limiting compound since phosphorus release mechanisms are more complex according to wang et al 2019 iron reduction follows a first order kinetic with k 0 05 h 1 so the quantity of iron reduced in the pipes is proportional to the sludge retention time for low retention times from the sludge velocity profile in the pipes the zone next to the pipe wall will present a much smaller velocity and so higher fe2 concentration than in the bulk from this we can assume that the formation of vivianite follows a wall mechanism rather than a bulk mechanism bigger pipe will see more iron being reduced compared to smaller pipes due to higher retention times however a big part of the fe2 produced will not have time to diffuse to the pipe wall and will precipitate in the bulk not causing scaling appendix c to summarize the morphology of the scaling and the laminar flow regime suggest that the scaling found in the sludge transport or handling units under anaerobic conditions follows a growth mechanism rather than an agglomeration mechanism we hypothesize that the iron reduction due to the anaerobic conditions is the driver for the formation of the scaling fig 2 both low diffusion velocities and high iron concentrations near the walls suggest that a wall mechanism growth is favoured these observations imply that larger diameter pipes may be better to use due to their lower wall area volume ratio even though they present higher sludge retention times iron reduction and phosphorus release will strongly contribute to the formation of vivianite scaling and are unavoidable however iron reduction should be almost complete after 24 h according to wang et al 2019 this means that allowing a fermenting sludge to rest in a unit bearing a high volume surface ratio eg a buffer tank for a day could allow all the iron to be reduced and the main part of the vivianite to form in the bulk of the sludge instead of creating problematic scaling in the units downstream a small fraction of the vivianite could still scale on the wall of the buffer tank but this should be manageable and is easily accessible for cleaning such buffer tank is used in the wwtp of dokhaven for a different purpose than scaling prevention vivianite scales were observed in this tank but it is not a major issue since it only requires a yearly cleaning no scaling problem downstream from this tank has been reported indicating that addition of such buffer tank may be a valid option for scaling prevention 3 2 dewatering units from the information collected the worst occurrence of scaling was around centrifuges used for the dewatering of undigested sludge the wwtps of hoensbroek bosscherveld and turku dewater their thickened sludge by centrifugation before sending it for disposal the scaling occurs in turku wwtp in the centrifuge and centrate pipe and is manageable with a manual cleaning being necessary 2 3 times per year costing around 2000 month information obtained from the wwtp the situation is more dramatic in hoensbroek and bosscherveld where important build up of scaling mainly composed of vivianite based compounds was observed in the centrifuge the centrate box and the centrate pipe it forces a stoppage and cleaning of the centrifuge every 1 2 weeks and a yearly replacement of the centrate pipe in hoensbroek scaling formation also happened in the wwtp of the blue plains in and downstream of the pre dewatering centrifuge before thp build up in the centrifuge increased torque and vibration obliging operators to put the equipment out of service for manual cleaning pathak et al 2018 scaling formation in the centrifuge and the centrate pipes caused the most severe operational problems compared to the other scaling location since the scaling observed in the centrifuges and in the centrate pipes are similar in their elemental composition and microscopic structures unpublished data detailed analyses were only carried out on the samples found in the centrate pipes the samples were quite different from the scaling found in the heat exchangers and the sludge transport pipes since the deposits were softer and mainly brown black instead of blue the scaling from blue plains hoensbroek and bosscherveld presented a similar elemental composition with 26 31 of fe 10 11 of p and 1 4 of ca which is close to the composition of vivianite 33 of fe 12 of p table 1 the samples were much more xrd amorphous than the scaling found in other sections of the wwtps but xrd still managed to identify vivianite impure in hoensbroek and as a minor fraction in blue plains pathak et al 2018 microscopic observations of these three samples revealed a structure with brown black and occasional blue layers suggesting a mix of species with vivianite not being the major compound fig 3 surprisingly edx showed a homogeneous distribution of iron and phosphorus across the samples the mössbauer spectroscopy study of the centrate sample from hoensbroek confirmed the presence of 23 of vivianite accounting for only 30 and 25 of the iron and phosphorus in the sample respectively the 70 of remaining iron is present in fe iii minerals according to mössbauer spectroscopy based on the elemental composition close to the one of vivianite we believe that vivianite originally formed and progressively oxidized centrifuges are not protected from air intrusion transforming into metavivianite fe2 fe3 2 po4 2 oh 2 6h2o and then santabarbaraite fe3 3 po4 2 oh 3 5h2o the structure of the scaling from bosscherveld supports this hypothesis it presents a blue layer vivianite on the most freshly formed side of the scaling and brown black fe p containing material possibly metavivianite and santabarbaraite deeper in the scaling fig 3 additionally the edx analyses revealed a homogeneous iron and phosphorus distribution across the entire sample oxidation of vivianite leads to the progressive destruction of its crystalline structure making the newly formed minerals undetectable by xrd dormann and poullen 1980 pratesi et al 2003 the mössbauer signals of the oxidation products of vivianite are close to the one observed in this study feiii δ 0 35 0 43 mm s qs 0 5 0 9 mms s according to dormann and poullen 1980 but are overlapping with the signal of iron oxides making it impossible to be attributed to metavivianite or santabarbaraite with certainty strengite is another possible fe iii p mineral but the conditions in the centrifuge are not favourable for its formation wilfert et al 2015 pathak et al 2018 the sample from turku is different in its composition 39 of fe 4 of p and 1 of ca appearance major orange phase minor black phase and is really fragile fig 3 room temperature mössbauer spectroscopy indicates that it is entirely composed by fe iii species excluding the presence of vivianite and metavivianite and contains ferrihydrite layered iron hydroxide could be an intermediate since they are formed by oxidation of fe oh 2 and inclusion of anions and later form ferric oxyhydroxides under further oxidation refait et al 1998 phosphate adsorption alone cannot explain the 5 of phosphorus present in the sample since it would suggest a capacity 5 times higher mg of p g of fe than engineered fe adsorbents kumar et al 2019 xrd indicated that the sample was mainly amorphous and could contain a small quantity of goethite which agrees with roldan et al 2002 stating that vivianite oxidation results in the formation of poorly crystalline fe iii oxides a polymorph of goethite the 4 2 k mössbauer spectroscopy measurement which allows fe iii phases speciation reveals that a mix of 23 santabarbaraite and 77 ferrihydrite is possible fig 4 and appendix h the scalings found in centrate pipes are mainly amorphous and rich in phosphorus and oxidized fe the major compounds seems to be oxidation products of vivianite metavivianite and santabarbaraite while fe iii oxides hydroxides are also present except for turku s sample where fe iii oxides hydroxides are the main fraction a ph increase favours both the precipitation of vivianite and iron oxides hydroxide and could be the main mechanism explaining the formation of scaling around the centrifuge indeed the ph increased by 0 3 during centrifugation in the wwtp of blue plains pathak et al 2018 and hoensbroek the effect of ph on ferrihydrite precipitation is straightforward since its solubility directly depends on the third power of the oh activity schwertmann 1991 the si of vivianite is proportional to the square of the activity of po4 3 which is increasing with the ph liu et al 2018 during centrifugation co2 stripping occurs due to the turbulences and the contact with air which triggers the observed ph increase battistoni et al 1997 this rise of ph is also the main mechanism triggering struvite scaling in post digestion dewatering centrifuges doyle and parsons 2002 taking into account the composition of the sludge liquor just before centrifugation in hoensbroek p 8 6 ppm fe2 27 4 ppm fe3 6 91 ppm ph 6 9 ionic strength 0 02 an increase to ph 7 22 signifies a si increase from 5 41 to 6 28 and 5 48 to 5 80 for vivianite and ferrihydrite respectively the values of si are high which can be explained by an overestimation of fe2 3 in the sample this overestimation is due to small colloidal iron particles going through the pores of the 0 45 µm filter we experimentally confirmed this but at a later moment when the way of operation of the wwtp changed since iron reduction is a relatively slow process compared to the instantaneous ph increase during centrifugation we consider that a certain steady state toward vivianite formation is established before centrifugation the concentrations of iron and phosphorus were decreased assuming vivianite and fe oh 2 formation to match the equilibrium si calculated above 5 41 and 5 48 such equilibrium conditions at ph 7 22 are for p 5 1 ppm fe2 17 7 ppm fe3 3 4 ppm resulting in the formation of 28 3 mg l of vivianite and 5 3 mg l of ferrihydrite it is clear that even a small ph increase can have an important effect on the precipitation of vivianite and ferrihydrite from these calculations it appears that the scaling would be composed of a majority of vivianite which reinforces our hypothesis that vivianite was initially formed and oxidized making it complicated to trace a second mechanism could also explain the formation of fe iii oxides since the centrifuge is not protected from air intrusion the soluble fe2 could be oxidized triggering the formation of poorly soluble fe oh 3 detailed calculations in appendix d reveal that fe ii oxidation is too slow to explain significant formation of fe iii to produce fe oh 3 it seems therefore that this mechanism is much less important compared to vivianite formation which is confirmed by the information collected from the wwtps the centrate scaling from hoensbroek blue plains and bosscherveld containing a high quantity of fe p species require regular cleaning while the one in turku mainly iron oxide hydroxide only needs to be removed twice a year the unique composition of turku s sample may be explained by the high fe p molar ratio 1 75 used in this wwtp the reduction in the fe2 concentration in the liquid phase of the sludge to the centrate 27 4 to 6 5 ppm is much larger when compared to the reduction in the phosphorus concentration 8 6 to 4 7 ppm and cannot be explained by the formation of vivianite the authors believe that this is due to an overestimation of the soluble iron before centrifugation as discussed above additionally the extreme mixing conditions in the centrifuge may promote scaling formation indeed the flow regime before the centrifuge is laminar not allowing an optimal mixing of the ions while centrifugation creates turbulent conditions yousuf and frawley 2018 also showed that increased shear stress lowers the secondary nucleation formation of crystals in the presence of parent crystals mersmann 2001 threshold by increasing the collision between particles the presence of existing scaling and rough surface also promotes secondary nucleation from the information collected it appears that scaling formation around centrifuges is mainly caused by a ph increase through co2 evolution in the centrate chamber and in a smaller extent by the oxidation of the soluble fe2 fig 5 the large shear forces created by centrifugation can aggravate the scaling formation stripping some co2 in a tank before centrifugation to increase the ph would initiate controlled vivianite formation in the bulk and may reduce the scaling formation allowing a longer time under anaerobic conditions for the sludge before centrifugation should also lead to a reduction of soluble phosphorus and iron concentration the addition of a buffer tank after the thickener could be a combined solution for the scaling around the centrifuge and in the anaerobic zones discussed in 3 2 no vivianite scaling was reported in post digester centrifuges indicating that a longer residence time could indeed be a suitable solution since the ph increase is due to co2 stripping creating a co2 saturated atmosphere in the centrifuge could theoretically be an option to prevent it more research needs to be undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of all these options counterintuitively a higher iron phosphorus molar ratio in the sludge may also reduce vivianite scaling formation a higher iron dosing reduces the quantity of phosphorus present in the soluble phase reducing the quantity of phosphorus available for precipitation therefore the ph increase observed during centrifugation would provoke less vivianite scaling formation for example the iron dosage in turku is high fe p 1 75 and the scaling only needs to be removed 2 3 times per year on the contrary wwtps dosing less iron fe p 1 14 in hoensbroek and 0 65 in bosscherveld need to remove the scaling every 1 2 weeks 3 3 heat exchangers from the information gathered from wwtps and supported by literature it appears that sludge heat exchangers are a common place for vivianite scaling to occur in the case of the wwtps of lübeck ejby mølle and amsterdam a blue and hard scale was present in the sludge heat exchanger used for the heating of the mesophilic anaerobic digester a similar situation was reported in literature in several other wwtps inside and downstream of the digested sludge heat exchanger in dallas shimada et al 2011 in the heat exchanger around the acid phase digestion in derby bjorn 2010 and in the heating loop in back s river wwtp marx et al 2001 problems at higher temperatures especially in pasteurization units have also been reported by buchanan et al 2014 panter et al 2013 and reusser 2009 in the wwtp of blue plains and venlo scaling was found in the heat exchanger used to cool down the sludge after thp the seven scalings found in heat exchangers used to warm up the sludge for mesophilic and thermophilic digestion were all reported to be vivianite by laboratory analysis in literature not specified but probably xrd and elemental analysis by visual observation in lübeck no sample was available only picture and by xrd in amsterdam and ejby mølle the scaling of amsterdam was further studied by mössbauer spectroscopy which confirmed the presence of vivianite as 68 in weight likely underestimated due to its partial oxidation the macroscopic and microscopic observations of the scaling from amsterdam show a crystalline hard and blue scale that seems to be purer no other phase than vivianite visually observed than the scaling found in sludge pipes or dewatering units fig 6 from the pictures available the scalings from lübeck and ejby mølle seem to have similar characteristics this supposed high purity is supported by the elemental composition of the sample from amsterdam 30 of fe 13 of p and only 2 of mg and 1 of ca as inorganic impurities it is interesting to note that mg2 and ca2 could be part of the structure of vivianite by substituting fe2 rothe et al 2016 seitz et al 1973 the scale formed in the heat exchanger after thp at blue plains wwtp presents a similar elemental composition with 32 of fe 12 of p 1 of mg and 1 of s however this sample is more fragile and composed of two main phases a major blue phase and an orange one fig 6 mössbauer spectroscopy results confirmed that the blue phase is vivianite which accounts for 72 of the scaling weight 75 of the total fe the remaining 25 of iron are fe iii species according to mössbauer spectroscopy and could be a mix of iron oxides hydroxides and metavivianite santabarbaraite the scaling found after thp in venlo was black and had a completely different composition 12 of p 10 of ca 9 of fe 2 5 of mg and 1 of s no vivianite was present according to microscopic observations from the on site observations described above temperature seems to promote vivianite scaling formation both when the sludge is heated up and cooled down this is in line with the finding of al borno and tomson 1994 who showed that vivianite solubility evolves hyperbolically in function of the temperature fig 7 their results indicate that vivianite was the most soluble around 30 35 c which is close to the temperature of operation of a mesophilic digester 37 c the flow rate in heat exchanger is usually quite high 60 m3 h for amsterdam wwtp for example which together with their geometry spiral shape corrugated tubes promotes turbulences alfa laval brochure 2020 spiralex brochure 2020 in order to prevent solid settling and thermal decomposition of organics lines 1991 if the flow is turbulent a homogeneous temperature distribution can be expected in the bulk of the sludge according to guo 2020 only a very thin layer of sludge near the wall the boundary layer will have a lower velocity and so higher temperature than the bulk as opposed to the more gradual velocity gradient existing for laminar flows appendix c the exact temperature of the wall has not been calculated since full description of the thermal situation was not the objective of this study from the information we collected the digested sludge is brought typically from 30 c to 38 c by a water stream decreasing from 60 to 55 c according to fig 7 the solubility product constant pksp of vivianite slightly increases from 35 738 to 35 766 between 30 c and 38 c it translates into the precipitation of a maximum 0 28 mg of vivianite per litre of sludge for a typical iron coagulated digested sludge considered in appendix e p 30 ppm fe2 15 ppm is 0 05 ph 7 considering the flowrate of the sludge in the heat exchanger of amsterdam wwtp 60 m3 h it corresponds to the precipitation of 16 8 g of vivianite per hour in one heat exchanger it seems unrealistic that all the vivianite formed in the heat exchanger would scale so this value is likely overestimated it is important to mention that iron was dosed in the sludge heating loop of the wwtp of amsterdam which surely contributed to scaling formation even though the turbulent flow regime suggests a bulk mechanism it is interesting to study what can happen in the boundary layer of a heat exchanger at the exit of the considered counter current heat exchanger the temperature of the water is 60 c while the temperature of the sludge is 38 c assuming that the wall temperature is the average of the temperature of the sludge and the heating water 8 times more vivianite 2 17 g l of sludge could potentially form at the wall at 50 c compared to the bulk at 38 c in derby wwtp peaks to 85 c of the heating water where observed and believed to aggravate the scaling which would lead to potential formation of 4 96 mg l of vivianite considering a wall temperature of 60 c fig 7 suggests that vivianite is more likely to form in the exit part of the heat exchanger where the sludge is the warmest which was observed by reusser 2009 the situation could be worse when the sludge is brought at higher temperature 55 c heating up sludge from 30 c to 55 c potentially produces 12 times more vivianite 3 4 mg l compared to heating up from 30 c to 38 c temperatures higher than 55 c cause severe vivianite scaling issues particularly in heat exchanger of pre pasteurization plants panter et al 2013 and of a specific thermophilic digester configuration reusser 2009 salehin et al 2019 did not find vivianite presence in digested sludge after thp by xrd and concluded that vivianite formation was hindered by thp which suggests that vivianite scaling would not occur after thp however our mössbauer spectroscopy measurements revealed that vivianite accounted for 18 of the total solids in the post thp digested sludge of blue plains wwtp showing the possibility for vivianite to form in the cambi installation of blue plains wwtp sludge after thp is cooled down from 160 to 41 c first by pressure reduction from steam release followed by dilution with process water and then with a heat exchanger it can be hypothesized that the vivianite scaling observed was formed in the colder sections of the heat exchanger with wall temperature 32 c according to fig 7 vivianite scaling in the cooling heat exchanger after thp could then occur in the cold sludge region while the warmer region should be scale free in the case of venlo wwtp thp is followed by thermophilic digestion at 55 c it is unlikely that the sludge temperature decreases below 32 c in the boundary layer under these conditions so it seems logical that no vivianite scaling was found there from the different hot spots identified vivianite scaling in the heat exchanger was the most commonly reported in literature table 1 it could be due to the fact that vivianite in heat exchangers is generally more recognisable clean hard and blue scale more accessible compared to pipe inspection and causing immediate operational issues temperature losses as observed by shimada et al 2011 and reusser 2009 while the scaling in the heat exchanger was manageable in most of the installations using mesophilic digestion it seems that it can be more severe in installation bringing sludges at higher temperatures vivianite scaling was observed in both tubular and spiral heat exchanger lübeck wwtp so it is complicated to say which type of heat exchanger would cause less trouble using steam injection instead of contact heat exchangers to promote bulk precipitation is sometimes used and could be an interesting alternative to reduce scaling buchanan et al 2014 panter et al 2013 however it involves more energy and on site production of boiled feed water making this strategy more complicated to apply in general maintaining a low and constant temperature difference between the sludge and the heating water to avoid high wall temperature seems to be the best solution to mitigate vivianite scaling reusser 2009 bjorn 2010 but is more complicated at thermophilic temperatures iron salt addition or sludge admixing see 3 5 in the heat exchanger loop can aggravate the problems further 3 4 sludge admixing an additional point that requires attention to control scaling formation is the way the different sludges are mixed together wastewater treatment produces different streams of sludge that will be brought together typically for pre dewatering or digestion those sludges have different characteristics ph temperature concentration of fe2 and po4 3 and when they are brought together the saturation index si of the mix can potentially be higher than the index of the individual sludges this can be particularly the case when an already fermented sludge is mixed with a relatively fresh sludge when a sludge ferments ph drops vfa production fe2 increases dissolution of iron precipitates and po4 3 increases poly phosphate from pao s hydrolysis the difference of temperature between sludges can also be a factor triggering vivianite scaling in dallas wwtp digester feed was periodically incorporated to recirculation sludge shimada et al 2011 which can aggravate the problem due to an increase of the saturation index because of influences on composition ph fe2 po4 3 and temperature similar mixing issues in addition to an increased ph due to co2 stripping were believed to aggravate vivianite scaling in back river wwtp heating loop marx et al 2001 to conclude mixing of different sludges can trigger or aggravate vivianite scaling to prevent or at least mitigate vivianite scaling it is important to minimize the ph temperature and concentration differences between sludges that are mixed this could be done by preferring continuous feed at a lower flowrate over big periodical feed flows more importantly the place where the mixing occurs should be wisely chosen the mixing of sludge should preferably happen in a unit where the volume to area ratio is high to favour bulk precipitation the use of buffer tanks to allow the majority of the vivianite to precipitate seems ideal on the contrary we do not recommend to mix sludges in or before a unit where the surface volume ratio is high e g in the case of in line mixing in pipes heat exchanger etc 3 5 digester vivianite formation is promoted under anaerobic conditions due to the release of phosphate and the reduction of fe ii and anaerobic digesters are therefore a preferential formation site wilfert et al 2018 vivianite scaling could happen on the walls of digesters similarly to struvite but should not be so problematic due to the high volume area ratio of digesters the authors think that the settling of vivianite particles in digesters is not likely to happen since vivianite particles have the same density as quartz but are usually smaller 100 150 μm maximum we assume that digester mixing is generally engineered in a way that it prevents settling of quartz and similarly settling of vivianite moreover vivianite settling was never reported as an issue in any of the numerous digesters bearing vivianite in their sludge sampled by our team in previous studies wilfert et al 2018 blue plains wwtp digester withdrawal contains some vivianite but does not accumulate not creating issues however the wwtp of spokane county experiences problems in its anaerobic digesters due to the accumulation of a dark sand like material suspected to be vivianite fig 8 each digester is mixed with an external draft tube designed to pull from the centre of the bottom section and feed at the top but that needs to be reversed when too much material has accumulated additional mixing is provided by an internal jet mixing ring located at the bottom of each digester this jet mixing system has experienced clogging potentially also caused by material accumulation this accumulation obliges the wwtp to drain the bottom of the digesters on a daily basis losing a part of the valuable microbial community and involving heavy maintenance on the contrary to previously discussed scaling problems the issue in spokane county digesters was the settling of vivianite particles not the deposition of a continuous vivianite layer this case was investigated to confirm the presence of vivianite understand the cause of the settling and evaluate the uniqueness of this situation the digester withdrawal is composed of a majority of fe 32 and p 9 with 2 of ca as the main other inorganic element mössbauer spectroscopy indicated that 45 of the sample is vivianite and may contain non detected oxidation products of vivianite metavivianite and santabarbaraite since 37 of the phosphorus is still not attributed xrd detected the presence of baricite mg fe 2 3 po4 2 8h2o that can be assumed to be impure vivianite and rhodochrosite mnco3 the later could in fact be siderite feco3 since mn is absent from the sample and siderite has a similar xrd pattern as rhodochrosite anthony et al 1990 also mössbauer spectroscopy detects 11 of a fe ii phase with hyperfine parameters similar to siderite medina et al 2006 the presence of siderite would also match with the 4 8 of co3 equivalent to 9 6 of feco3 detected by μgc data not shown the microscopic observations reveal that the majority of the sample was composed by blue particles presenting a fe p overlap fig 8 these particles showed similar structure sheets agglomerate as the vivianite particles found in digested sludge wilfert et al 2018 prot et al 2019 and 2020 but were free and more spherical a longer retention time in the digester could promote erosion the particles were not bigger 100 150 μm than the largest of the particles usually encountered in digested sludge the terminal settling velocity of a vivianite particle of 150 μm of diameter was evaluated to be 2 27 m h appendix f this velocity is smaller than the one produced by the digester mixing vertical velocity 20 m h so we would not expect the particles to settle however vivianite does settle and the turnover time for these digesters is 1 h which is in the high range compared to 4 digesters studied by meroney and colorado 2009 24 54 min suggesting a not sufficient mixing from a discussion with the operators of the digesters of spokane county the mixing system is unique and no other installations encountered similar settling problems to conclude the mixing design seems to be the major cause of the problem for the specific case of spokane county wwtp the addition of an alternative mixing system to the existing installation could provide sufficient mixing and appear to be the most efficient solution but could be costly and complicated the digester is emptied by an overflow at the top of the installation which may not be optimal in this situation since the sludge is not homogeneous discharging from a lower point in the digester could help preventing vivianite accumulation more generally it is interesting to note that working at higher solid content in a digester would increase the viscosity of the sludge and therefore lower the particle settling speed for example increasing the solid content from 2 5 solid content in spokane county wwtp to 5 would decrease the settling velocity from 2 27 to 0 28 m h appendix f lastly we noticed that vivianite was agglomerating on some particles in the digester withdrawal increasing their size and therefore their settling potential fig 8 accumulation of vivianite on sand particles in a fluidized bed reactor was already proven possible by priambodo et al 2017 to avoid this agglomeration solids and especially sand should consistently be removed before digestion not to be used as a centre of agglomeration for vivianite 3 6 evaluation of the findings from the information collected it seems that vivianite scaling in wwtps is occurring much more often than reported in literature from the five preferential scaling places studied three seems to be more common 1 the anaerobic pipes and units before sludge digestion 2 around the pre dewatering centrifuges treating undigested sludge and 3 in the heat exchangers around anaerobic digestion vivianite is usually the major component of the scaling in these three zones with fes and iron oxides hydroxides being minor phases in the zone 2 vivianite gradually oxidizes to turn into amorphous metavivianite and santabarbaraite the vivianite formation mechanism is different depending on the scaling place and can involve iron reduction ph increase or temperature changes different prevention solutions based on the formation mechanisms are proposed in table 2 a common prevention strategy is the use of commercial anti scalant which is not discussed in this study it appears that the way sludge streams with different characteristics are admixed e g raw sludge digested sludge is an aggravating factor of vivianite scaling it should be done in unit with high volume surface ratio like buffer tanks to promote bulk precipitation vivianite settling in digesters cannot be classified as a common issue since the case studied involved an unique mixing system that we believe is the cause of the problem so far vivianite scaling did not attract a lot of attention compared to struvite scaling since the importance of vivianite in wastewater treatment was only recently highlighted moreover vivianite scaling is often wrongly mistaken for struvite scaling while the presence of struvite scaling was never detected in this study it needs to be noted that struvite scaling is more likely to happen in wwtps using ebpr parsons and doyle 2002 while vivianite scaling should preferentially happen in wwtps dosing iron to remove phosphorus the absence of struvite scaling in the presence of iron can be explained by its lower solubility 6 31 10 5 m for pksp 12 6 than the one of vivianite 6 92 10 8 m for pksp 35 8 also vivianite oxidation leads to the formation of amorphous compounds that are more complicated to identify even mössbauer spectroscopy analysis the best option for vivianite quantification presents limitations especially due to an incomplete database on iron compounds in sludge iron addition may be favourable for energy production via enhanced primary settling and we discussed in prot et al 2020 that higher iron dosage is favourable for vivianite formation and thus for subsequent magnetic recovery we foresee that higher iron dosing will be more commonly applied in the near future for different reasons struvite scaling prevention sulphide control in biogas and to meet more stringent legislation requirement for phosphorus removal additionally higher iron dosing increases the share of phosphorus present as vivianite which can subsequently be recovered via magnetic extraction providing a new possible phosphorus recovery route prot et al 2019 2020 dosing more iron is not incompatible with vivianite scaling prevention since bigger quantities of iron dosed achieve lower soluble phosphorus more phosphorus chemically fixed thus less phosphate released from biomass reducing the phosphorus pool available for vivianite scaling vivianite scaling occurrence does not mean that the quantity of iron dosed needs to be adjusted but rather that it needs to be dosed better this study raises points of attention and proposes mitigation prevention solutions that should be evaluated in each specific case by the water utilities 4 conclusion the main conclusion of this study is that vivianite scaling is occurring more often than the lack of information in literature suggests three preferential scaling places could be identified each of them presenting a different vivianite formation mechanism firstly the reduction of ferric iron triggered the formation of crystalline vivianite in the sections where undigested sludge met anaerobic conditions eg thickened sludge pipes secondly co2 stripping occurring during centrifugation of undigested sludge caused a ph increase responsible for the formation of vivianite that could later oxidize to santabarbaraite thirdly the temperature dependence of the solubility of vivianite can drive the formation of vivianite scaling on the walls of the heat exchangers used for digested sludge heating additionally scaling prevention solutions were discussed in each case for example the use of an anaerobic buffer tank immediately after thickening would promote the formation of vivianite in the bulk of the sludge reducing the vivianite scaling issues in the pipes and centrifuges downstream the choice of the appropriate solution and the related cost analysis should be undertaken in each specific case since costs for maintenance and material vary depending on the wwtp design and location we believe that this work can be of interest for water authorities for vivianite scaling mitigation as well as for researchers investigating

c 1 power law parameters determination to describe the rheology of non newtonian fluids like sludge 3 models are typically used the power law model the bingham model and the herschel and bulkley ratkovich et al 2013 reviewed a number of articles dealing with sludge rheology modelling and concluded that none of these models was better than the others moreover all the 3 models often give a satisfying fitting of the data which is not surprising since their expression derive one from the other for this study the power law model will be used τ k d v d r n where τ is the shear stress in n m2 k is the fluid consistency coefficient in n sn m2 d v d r is the shear rate in s 1 n is the flow behaviour index dimensionless the constants k and n vary depending on the solid content temperature and state of digestion of the sludge cao et al 2016 they need to be determined by fitting the experimental data however no rheological measurements were done in the current study so the parameters will be estimated from literature data for sludges with similar properties tss 3 1 t 20 c undigested sludge and modelled with the power law from the experimental data of wei et al 2018 honey and pretorius 2020 füreder et al 2018 and rosenberg et al 2002 we estimate that the parameters will be in the range 0 2 0 4 for n and 2 100 for k we excluded some much higher k values found in rosenberg et al 2002 since it was in contradiction with the 3 other sources c 2 flow regime evaluation the piping system in hoensbroek can be visualized on fig c1 to determine the flow regime in the pipes the reynolds number derived from a power law modelling needs to be calculated r e ρ v 2 n d n k 8 n 1 where r e is the reynolds number for the power law model dimensionless k is the fluid consistency coefficient in n sn m2 n is the flow behaviour index dimensionless ρ is the density of the sludge in kg m3 d is the diameter of the pipe in m unless it has a very high solid content sludge has a similar density than water so is set at 1000 kg m3 for the following calculation considering the ranges for the n and k factor estimated above the reynolds number in the pipe 3 d3 0 08 m l3 16 m varies from 13 to 1679 signifying that the flow regime is laminar since re 2100 ratkovich et al 2013 this is in line with what is usually reported in literature where sludge flow in pipes is usually considered laminar slatter 2004 haldenwang et al 2012 moreover the velocity for a laminar turbulent transition is estimated at 1 5 2 0 m s honey and pretorius 2020 while the velocity in the pipe 3 is 1 0 m s considering that pipe 3 is the smallest of the three pipes a laminar flow should be observed in the 2 other pipes as well d1 0 2 m l1 30 m and d2 0 1 m l2 5 m c 3 vivianite scaling formation the authors consider that vivianite scaling could form in 2 ways by collision of the particles with the pipe wall and further agglomeration or by precipitation from the dissolved species following iron reduction in a boundary layer considering that the flow regime is laminar in the pipe system the first formation mechanism is unlikely since it would require some transversal vivianite particle movement from this point on the second mechanism is studied the pipe 3 at hoensbroek wwtp has been opened after 3 5 years of operation and a scaling layer of 0 55 cm had formed mössbauer spectroscopy indicates that 72 of the scaling is vivianite knowing the density of vivianite d 2 69 it means that 39 6 kg of vivianite scaling formed in the pipe 3 over 3 5 years 1 29 g h c 4 velocity profile in the pipes from simpson and janna 2008 the velocity profile in a circular duct for a non newtonian fluid following the power law has the following expression v r 3 n 1 n 1 1 r r n 1 n v where n is the flow behaviour index dimensionless and estimated before ranging on 0 2 0 4 v r is the velocity at the radius r r is the distance from the centre of the pipe 0 r r r is the internal radius of the pipe v is the average velocity in the pipe for further calculations n will be fixed at value of 0 3 c 5 iron reduction rate the sludge between the thickener and the centrifuge contains 1070 mg of iron and 560 mg of phosphorus per kg of sludge ts 3 1 under anaerobic conditions phosphate will be released from the polyphosphate accumulating organisms however in chemical sludge like in hoensbroek phosphorus is not only found in pao s but is also bound to fe wang et al 2019 observed that vivianite progressively formed during incubation of activated chemical sludge meaning that some phosphorus was made available for vivianite formation it is complicated to differentiate the phosphate released from pao s and from fep minerals therefore the estimation of the vivianite scaling formed will be evaluated assuming that iron reduction is the limiting factor the quantity of iron reduced can be calculated from the retention time in the different layer of the pipe according to wang et al 2019 iron reduction in sludge in anaerobic conditions is following a first order kinetic with k 0 055 h 1 this translates into the reduction of 561 mg of fe kg of sludge in the thickener during the residence time of 13 5 h which will be taken as the initial fe0 value for the subsequent iron reduction we neglect here the reduction occurring in pipes 1 and 2 due to very low retention time compare to the one in the digester we obtain the expression f e t f e 0 1 exp 0 055 t where fe t represents the quantity of iron reduced into fe2 after entering the pipe mg fe kg of sludge fe0 is a constant representing the reducible iron at the beginning of the pipe system which is worth 509 of fe kg of sludge after removing the 561 mg fe kg of sludge already reduced in the thickener t is the time elapsed since the sludge enters pipe h it also corresponds to the retention time of the sludge in the pipe at a radius r since the retention times in the pipes are relatively small compared to the iron reduction rate there is almost a linear relation between the quantity of iron reduced and the retention time therefore the iron reduced is inversely proportional to the velocity of the sludge from fig c2 it can be noticed that the velocity profile of the sludge in pipe 3 will create zones near the edge of the pipe where fe2 concentration will be higher and promote vivianite scaling formation this iron production in combination with the phosphorus release from the sludge will lead to higher saturation index next to the wall of the pipe than in the bulk fig c3 c 6 influence of the pipe diameter on vivianite scaling formation the evolution of the saturation index fig c3 suggests that the vivianite scaling formation is a wall mechanism happening near the edge of the pipe therefore one can assume that bigger pipe would be more favourable than smaller one since their wall area volume ratio is lower to confirm this hypothesis the iron reduction profile was studied for 3 pipes of same length 16 m and increasing diameter d1 0 2 m d2 0 1 m and d3 0 08 m from fig c4 it can be seen that a pipe with bigger diameter will logically allow more iron reduction due to an increased sludge retention time for further discussion we arbitrarily assume that vivianite scales in the zones where more than 1 ppm of fe2 is produced by reduction from fig c4 we can see that this corresponds to a distance to the wall of 13 5 1 4 and 0 7 mm for pipe of diameter 0 2 0 1 0 08 m respectively this is explained by the fact that wider pipe will have lower velocity and so bigger retention time allowing more sludge to be reduced however if the sludge has a higher retention time it also means that the flow will be lower thus creating less vivianite scaling in terms of weight for example there is 7 times more volume of the pipe 1 d1 0 2 m that will have fe 1 ppm compared to pipe 3 d3 0 08 m however there will be 43 times more sludge that will effectively be under condition where fe 1 ppm if the flow in the different sludge layer is taken into account table c1 similar conclusions can be drawn for limit iron concentration other than 1 ppm from these calculations and assuming that vivianite scales following a wall mechanism formation the use of big pipe seems to favour vivianite scaling formation due to the higher retention time thus higher iron reduction potential it is also important to take diffusion into consideration to verify if the fe2 atoms have time to reach the wall in their residence time in the pipe c 7 fe2 diffusion the time that a fe2 ion will take to reach the wall of the pipe depending on its position can be approximated with the einstein law of diffusion miller 1924 t x 2 2 d where t is the time for the particle to cover the distance x m x is the distance covered by the particle in the time t s d is the specific diffusion coefficient for the particle studied in the medium considered m2 s henry 1994 gives the diffusion coefficient of fe2 in water at 25c 7 19 10 10 m2 s 1 zhang et al 2016 observed that the diffusion coefficient of iodide in digested sludge was following a logarithmic relationship to the solid content in the sludge by extrapolating their data for the solid content of the sludge of hoensbroek we can estimate that the diffusion coefficient decreased by 7 times compared to pure water we estimate that the evolution of the diffusion coefficient will be the same for fe2 ions giving d 10 10 m2 s 1 considering the distance to the pipe wall where the quantity of iron reduced is equal to 1 ppm table c1 the time required for an atom of fe2 to diffuse to the wall would be 911 250 9800 and 2450s for the pipes 1 2 and 3 respectively this is much bigger than the retention time of 144 s for the sludge at this location of the pipe the distance to the pipe wall that would allow fe2 ions enough time to travel to the pipe wall are 0 28 0 35 and 0 7 mm for the pipes 1 2 and 3 respectively it suggests that even though more fe2 would be produced in bigger pipes due to higher sludge retention time a big part of the fe2 produced would not have time to diffuse to the pipe wall to produce scaling to summarize the morphology of the scaling and the laminar flow regime suggest that the scaling found in the pipes before dewatering units follow a growth mechanism rather than an agglomeration mechanism we hypothesize that the iron reduction due to the anaerobic conditions is the driver to the formation of the scaling the lower sludge residence time in bigger pipes allows more iron to be reduced potentially creating more scaling however both low diffusion velocity and higher iron concentration near the walls imply that a wall mechanism growth is possible these observations imply that bigger pipes may be better to use due to their lower wall area volume ratio according to wang et al 2019 iron reduction in sludge in anaerobic conditions is following a first order kinetic with k 0 055 s 1 this translates into the reduction of 561 and 1 5 mg of fe kg of sludge in the thickener residence time of 13 5 h and in the pipe system residence time of 3 4 min respectively assuming that all the iron reduced in the pipe scales and that 78 of the iron that scales does it as vivianite data from mössbauer spectroscopy 66 0 g of vivianite could form every hour in the pipe system this translates into the formation of 5 0 g of vivianite per hour in the small pipe section ø3 0 08 m l3 16 m when the pipe section before the centrifuge d3 0 08 m was opened in hoensbroek it revealed that the thickness of the scaling was 0 55 cm the pipe was opened in november 2019 3 5 years after being installed mössbauer spectroscopy indicates that 72 of the scaling is vivianite hypothesizing a uniform scaling formation on the entire pipe between the thickener and the centrifuge and knowing the density of vivianite d 2 69 1 39 g h of vivianite scaling forms this represents 28 of the value obtained above which suggests that a significant fraction of the iron reduced stays in the bulk appendix d the sludge reaching the dewatering units is anaerobic since it has usually been under anaerobic conditions for a couple of hours 13 h in hoensbroek for example since the solubility of fe ii compounds is higher than the one of fe iii compounds the equilibrium concentration of fe2 is also higher compared to the one of fe3 as noticed during on site measurements fe2 27 4 ppm fe3 6 91 ppm before centrifuge in hoensbroek during centrifugation the liquid fraction is separated from the sludge and comes in contact with oxygen so that fe2 can get oxidized to fe3 the freshly formed fe3 could immediately precipitate due to the lower solubility of fe iii compared to fe ii compounds the oxidation of fe2 is ruled by the following equation d f e 2 d t k o h 2 f e 2 p o 2 where f e 2 is the concentration of fe2 in mol l o h is the concentration of oh in mol l p o 2 is the partial pressure of o2 worth 0 2 atm in atmospheric conditions we assume here that the diffusion of the o2 is not limiting due to the important mixing k is the kinetic rate of the reaction in l2 mol 2 min 1 atm 1 according to sung and morgan 1980 k is worth 2 9 1013 l2 mol 2 min 1 atm 1 for an ionic strength of 0 02 m at a ph of 7 22 measured in the centrate and a p o 2 of 0 2 air environment in the centrifuge 4 1 ppm of fe2 would be reduced in 1 min which in the same order of magnitude than the retention time in hoensbroek centrifuge it seems like this mechanism would not be too important compared to vivianite formation which is confirmed by the information collected from the wwtps the centrate scaling from hoensbroek blue plains and bosscherveld containing a high quantity of fe p species require regular cleaning while the one in turku mainly iron oxide hydroxide needs to be removed only twice a year appendix e table e1 table h1 we consider here a typical digested sludge from a wwtp using cpr with iron the characteristics of the soluble phase of this sludge at 37 c are p 30 ppm fe2 15 ppm ph 7 is 0 05 m soluble phosphorus ph and is are average values obtained from prot et al 2020 and fe2 comes from the results from 4 digested sludge studied by wilfert et al 2018 the software visual minteq was used to determine the saturation index and the concentration of the species in function of the temperature the value of the pksp of vivianite was manually modified for each temperature considered following the relation from al borno and tomson 1994 pksp 234 205 12 242 6 t 92 510 logt at 37 c the saturation index for vivianite is 5 417 the conditions at 37 c are considered the equilibrium conditions since it is the usual temperature of digested sludge all the equilibrium concentrations showed in table e1 for the different temperatures were calculated to match si 5 417 as the equilibrium condition from the information we collected the digested sludge is brought typically from 30 c to 38 c which corresponds to a soluble concentration decrease of 0 03 and 0 1 ppm for p and fe2 respectively it corresponds to the formation of 0 28 mg l of vivianite appendix f rheological measurements were not carried out with the sludge of spokane county so the value of the apparent viscosity of digested sludge was obtained from literature review the digested sludge of spokane county has an average solid content of 2 2 5 literature indicates that the apparent viscosity of digested sludge ranging from 1 8 to 3 6 of solid varies from 0 035 to 0 5 pa s markis et al 2016 eshtiaghi et al 2012 goel et al 2004 baudez et al 2011 these values were taken for shear stresses around 100 s 1 since sludge is a shear thinning fluid its viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate markis et al 2016 eshtiaghi et al 2012 in a digester the shear rates are not homogeneous and are higher in the zones closer to the stirrer baudez et al 2011 for example show that the apparent viscosity of a 2 5 solid digested sludge decreases from 0 25 to 0 035 pa s for an increasing shear rate from 4 to 90 s 1 the shear rate during digestion cannot be too high to preserve the bacteria functioning jiang et al 2016 but high enough to maintain a proper mixing therefore we will consider a case where the shear rate is moderate and assume a viscosity of 0 1 pa s newton s law gives the terminal speed of a particle in

17041,reuse of faecal sludge in agriculture has many potential benefits but also poses risks to human health to better understand the potential risks quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was performed for three population groups in kampala uganda wastewater and faecal sludge treatment plant workers farmers using faecal sludge and consumers of faecal sludge fertilised vegetables two models were applied for farmers and consumers one based on pathogen concentrations from field sampling of sludge soils and vegetables and one based on theoretical pathogen contribution from the last sludge application including decay and soil to crop transfer of pathogens the risk was evaluated for two pathogens enterohaemorrhagic e coli ehec and ascaris lumbricoides the field data on sludge soil and vegetables indicated that the last application of faecal sludge was not the sole pathogen source correspondingly the model using field data resulted in higher risks for farmers and consumers than the theoretical model assuming risk from sludge only except when negligible for both for farmers the yearly risk of illness based on measured concentrations was 26 from ehec and 70 from ascaris compared with 1 2 and 1 4 respectively considering the theoretically assumed contribution from the sludge for consumers the risk of illness based on field samples was higher from consumption of leafy vegetables 100 from ehec 99 from ascaris than from consumption of cabbages negligible for ehec 26 from ascaris with the theoretical model the risk of illness from ehec was negligible for both crops whereas the risk of illness from ascaris was 64 and 16 for leafy vegetables and cabbage respectively for treatment plant workers yearly risk of illness was 100 from ehec and 99 4 from ascaris mitigation practices evaluated could reduce the relative risk by 30 70 these results can help guide treatment and use of faecal sludge in kampala to protect plant workers farmers and consumers

better containment and treatment can provide different benefits from decreased disease transmission and protection of the natural environment to utilisation of resources in excreta as e g plant nutrients guest et al 2009 peccia and westerhoff 2015 material flow analyses show a negative soil nutrient balance in uganda lederer et al 2015 nkonya et al 2005 sheldrick and lingard 2004 wortmann

recirculating the plant nutrients in excreta which originate from food to agricultural land coupled with other practices could help overcome crop nutrient deficiency while decreasing the need for mineral fertiliser thus decreasing use of fossil resources for fertiliser manufacture and exploitation of finite rock phosphate reserves based on fao statistics on protein intake 2014 2017 average the nitrogen and phosphorus content in excreta in uganda comprises 98 200 tons and 14 800 tons respectively annually jönsson et al 2004 this is almost 16 fold and 9 fold the current use of mineral fertiliser faostat average 2014 2017 many factors could decrease the efficiency of nutrient recovery from excreta but the high availability of these resources is promising another driver for faecal sludge management could be financial opportunities through a reuse scheme it has been proposed that agricultural reuse of faecal sludge could be the economic driver for uptake of such systems diener et al 2014 despite difficulties that need to be overcome to optimise faecal sludge reuse studies show rather high acceptance for faecal sludge as fertiliser and willingness to pay for it among ugandan farmers danso et al 2017 this is evident in practice at the lubigi wastewater and faecal sludge treatment plant wwfstp in kampala where all the sludge produced is bought by small and medium scale farmers for use in agriculture r sakaya lubigi plant engineer personal communication july 2019 recirculating nutrients in human excreta to agriculture can increase crop production and food security however pathogens excreted from the human body could also be present in faecal sludge many pathogens in excreta are transmitted through the faecal oral route and pose a microbial hazard for end consumers of fertilised produce whereas pathogens infecting through skin contact many be the dominant microbial hazard for workers along the faecal sludge treatment and reuse management chain the

decision making who 2006a however the qmra approach may suffer from lack of data on pathogen contamination setting specific dose response relationships and validation of the estimated risks with epidemiological data van abel and taylor 2018 who 2006b the aim of the present study was thus to assess quantitatively the microbial risk related to treatment wwfstp workers and reuse farmers and consumers of treated faecal sludge from the lubigi plant based on pathogen concentrations measured along the faecal sludge management service chain two models were built for the analysis a field model

based on a decay and transfer model using pathogen concentrations in raw faecal sludge at the wwfstp as initial input fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and process description lubigi wwfstp 0 346939n 32 544270e 1140 m asl is managed by the ugandan national water and sewerage corporation and has been in operation since 2015 it has the capacity to treat 400 m3 of faecal sludge and 5000 m3 of wastewater per day faecal sludge from the city and surrounding areas is collected by vacuum trucks from on site sanitation systems schoebitz et al 2016 at the plant the faecal sludge goes through a three stage process initial screening sedimentation in two settling tanks which operate alternately one on duty and one on standby and drying in covered sand beds after a storage period intended to be at least six months the faecal sludge is sold as agricultural fertiliser however due to high demand customers often collect the dried sludge before the intended storage period 2 2 field sampling a recent review of 22 qmras performed on countries in ssa identified gaps in data collection van abel and taylor 2018 to overcome this limitation in this study specific field sampling was performed for enumeration determination of microorganisms samples of raw faecal sludge n 3 1 occasion dried faecal sludge n 33 3 occasions soil n 22 3 occasions and crops n 7 2 occasions were collected in july 2018 february 2019 july 2019 and january 2020 for faecal sludge samples the sampling procedure was in line with epa standards epa 1989 for each drying bed three samples each made of three pooled subsamples were collected in zip lock bags stored in an ice cooled container and transported to the laboratory at makerere microbiology for analysis two batches of unused dried faecal sludge found at one farm were also sampled soil samples were collected from five fields on three different farms three of the fields were fertilised with faecal sludge from lubigi wwfstp one with npk and one with chicken manure pooled samples of soil 4 subsamples adding up to 50 80 g were taken from the top layer 0 10 cm in the field following a random location stratified using a regular grid stored in zip lock bags and kept at ambient temperature during transport to the laboratory three farms for which contact details were available which were also willing to participate in the project were all included in the sampling due to their limited number three sets of samples were collected from vegetable crops from cabbages brassica oleracea growing in a field fertilised with npk n 3 from amaranthus spp amaranth locally known as dodo n 3 mollee et al 2017 sogbohossou et al 2015 and from red creole onion allium cepa in a field fertilised with sludge n 2 all sampled vegetables were randomly picked and stored in sterile plastic bags during transport to the laboratory for analysis the data on field samples were used in the qmra table 2 2 3 laboratory analysis the field samples were analysed for escherichia coli enterococcus spp ascaris lumbricoides and salmonella spp the e coli and enterococcus spp concentrations in all matrices faecal sludge soil vegetables were determined on 10 g of material serially diluted 1 9 with buffered peptone water chromocult coliform ec agar was used for the detection of e coli and bile esculin azide agar for the detection of enterococcus spp by plating 0 1 ml giving a detection limit of 100 cfu g 1 material from three dilutions and incubating for 24 2 hours at 37 c for ascaris the method proposed by the water research commission of south africa was used moodley et al 2008 analysing eggs in 10 g of sludge the method involves assessment of viable eggs by visual inspection under the microscope after 3 weeks of incubation for detection of salmonella spp samples of dried sludge from one sampling occasion n 15 were enriched 25 g in rappaport vassiliadis broth and enumerated on xylos lysine deoxycholate agar 2 4 qmra strategy framework this qmra followed the conventional steps of hazard identification exposure assessment dose response and risk characterisation haas et al 2014 karavarsamis and hamilton 2010 mara and sleigh 2010 who 2006b the occupational risk caused by involuntary ingestion was estimated for workers on the faecal sludge line at the wwfstp farmers working in fields where faecal sludge is used as a fertiliser and end consumers of raw vegetables grown in fields fertilised with faecal sludge table 1 to assess the contribution from faecal sludge reuse relative to the pathogen concentrations already present in the environment and the risks to farmers and consumers field and theoretical models were applied fig 1 measured pathogen concentrations in faecal sludge soil and vegetables were used in a field model fm to estimate risks while measured pathogen concentrations in raw sludge were used as initial input in a theoretical model tm and literature values for decay and migration were used to derive concentrations in soil and on vegetables 2 5 hazard identification among infectious diseases transmitted through faecal contamination diarrhoea accounts for most disability adjusted life years dalys in uganda mainly in children and the elderly while soil transmitted helminths are the most prevalent pathogens institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme 2018 this study assessed the risk from enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli ehec and ascaris lumbricoides pathogens posing risks for all three groups included in the qmra together with rotavirus and calicivirus pathogenic e coli are the most frequently identified global cause of gastrointestinal illnesses in children below 5 years of age fletcher et al 2013 responsible for more than 50 of all diarrhoeal deaths lanata et al 2013 abba et al 2009 ehec has been identified as a cause of diarrhoea in children aged below five years in uganda but is less common than other e coli pathotypes masiga et al 2020 musiime et al 2009 tumwine et al 2003 due to the milder more chronic nature of infection ascaris lumbricoides and other soil transmitted helminths contribute less to dalys compared with diarrhoea institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme 2018 however helminth infection can result in longer term impairment of mental and physical development hotez et al 2006 jukes et al 2002 ascaris eggs can survive for months to years under severe environmental conditions dryzer et al 2019 stott et al 2003 de faria et al 2017 and this pathogen is therefore suggested for qmra in regions where it is prevalent who 2006b the risk assessment in the present study thus included one pathogen persistent to treatment ascaris lumbricoides but which causes less severe disease and one pathogen more sensitive to treatment ehec but which can cause severe disease and which has a confirmed low infectious dose teunis et al 2004 tilden et al 1996 stressing its importance as a bacterial pathogen samples of faecal sludge soil and vegetables were analysed for e coli as described above table 2 and it was assumed that 8 consisted of ehec howard et al 2006 in the ascaris analysis a recovery rate of 0 85 was assumed for sludge karkashan et al 2015 and 0 37 for soil steinbaum et al 2017 2 6 exposure assessment 2 6 1 wwfttp worker scenario there is growing concern about the health conditions of sanitation workers world bank et al 2019 this scenario focused on the operational staff 11 individuals at lubigi wwfstp regarding their exposure during faecal sludge management in previous research by makerere university students five different activities were identified as potentially hazardous table 3 offloading the raw faecal sludge from the truck working at the grit removal station moving the faecal sludge from drying beds to storage beds loading the truck with dried faecal sludge and eating near the drying beds kiffe and wycliffe 2016 using literature data on occupational exposure schonning et al 2007 u s environmental protection agency 2018 2017 1997 westrell et al 2004 involuntary ingestion during each activity was estimated after site visits and interviews with the workers these activities were linked to four duties performed by the wwfstp workers generic site supervision events per person per year pppy n 43 working at the inlet n 31 pppy working at the grit and settling tanks n 175 pppy and working at the drying beds n 91 pppy involuntary daily ingestion i of faecal sludge for each duty was estimated as the sum of sludge ingested during the activities performed during that day ingestion mg day 1 per duty type ig i s d was estimated using a normal distribution table 3 in addition reduced involuntary ingestion igm im sm dm due to mitigation wearing a mask and improved hygiene in eating eating location and hand washing was assessed assuming that the measures reduced ingestion by 90 during working activities and 50 during eating the daily pathogen dose dw eggs or cfu day 1 for a duty i e worker on that shift was calculated as 1 d w i g i s d i n g e s t i o n c rs ds concentration ω a e fraction of infective pathogens where c is concentration of organism e coli or viable ascaris egg in raw sludge crs for duties at inlet and grit and settling tanks or in dried faecal sludge cds for generic duties and at the drying beds and ω e is the fraction of e coli assumed to be ehec 2 6 2 farmer scenario this scenario focused on farmers using the faecal sludge as fertiliser and assessed the exposure from involuntary ingestion of contaminated soil a general estimate of farmland affected by this practice was made considering that lubigi wwfstp is likely to sell 1450 2900 m3 of faecal sludge from drying beds per year personal communication july 2019 this could be spread on an area of 67 136 ha of farmland involving 700 1500 farmers assuming a wet density of 1 4 kg l 1 strande et al 2014 an average total solids rate of 30 lindberg and rost 2018 and 10 ton ha 1 application per year in line with south african regulations and an average of 11 farmers per hectare julien et al 2019 farmers activities were divided into two types activities involving intense contact with soil performed in the first 10 days after fertilisation ifh and activities involving less contact with soil performed on the other days ifl the involuntary ingestion mg day 1 for the two activities was estimated with a distribution as pert 0 0467 0 0642 0 0814 and pert 0 005 0 0123 0 0205 respectively table 1 a mitigation scenario with farmers wearing a face cover during the first 10 days was also considered this measure was

days of the year thus being exposed to soil 2 6 3 consumer scenario this scenario focused on consumers of raw products raw vegetables are not a fundamental part of the ugandan diet kabwama et al 2019

days was tested as a way to mitigate risks for consumers 2 7 dose response assessment dose response curves were used to determine the relationship between ingested dose and probability of infection navarro et al 2009 formulated a dose response model for ascaris based on epidemiological data collected in mexico blumenthal et al 1996 cifuentes et al 1993 which has been used by most qmra studies since 2009 and also in this study dose response models crockett et al 1996 haas et al 1999 strachan et al 2001 have continuously been tested and refitted against outbreak data for ehec where doses are known strachan et al 2005 teunis et al 2004 2009 the most recent assessment and fitting of models to the global e coli o157 h7 outbreak teunis et al 2008 concluded that infectivity may vary widely between strains and that the best fitting model is a beta poisson model using a beta binomial likelihood both the ascaris and ehec models in this study used the simplified beta poisson equation 7 p i d 1 1 d β α with median infection as 8 n 50 β 2 1 α 1 where pi represents the probability of infection for an ingested dose d in each event the probability of illness was then calculated using an infection to illness rate λ 9 p i l l d p i d λ in the case of ehec the rate for e coli o157 h7 λ 0 35 was used machdar et al 2013 considering the heterogeneity of illness for ascaris walker et al 2013 λ was modelled as a pert distribution 0 15 0 27 0 39 dold and holland 2011 mara and bos 2009 the annual probability of illness p i l l y r was then calculated as 10a p i l l y r a 1 1 p i l l n or 10b p i l l y r b 1 1 n 1 p i l l where n is number of events days of exposure equation 10a was used with a constant infection to illness rate λ across events and equation 10b with a variable probability of illness note that the model considers probability of infection at any event as independent from other events with no immunity developed after infection in the consumer scenario a single portion 30 g 52 events was taken as the minimum consumption unit of vegetables and assumed to occur on a weekly basis 2 8 risk characterisation the disease burden was calculated and expressed in dalys per 10 000 persons and year lopez et al 2006 mara and bos 2009 murray et al 2012 the who threshold of 10 6 daly would correspond to 0 01 years lost per 10 000 persons a year and a 10 4 daly pppy to 1 year lost per 10 000 persons a year outcome of illness in terms of proportion with mild mi moderate mo severe s and fatal f severity weighting and duration of each outcome used for calculating dalys eq 11 were based on previous studies katukiza 2013 pullan et al 2014 for each scenario the probability of illness from equation 10 was multiplied by the frequency f severity s and duration d of each outcome of illness as 11 d a l y m i m o s f p i l l y r f m i m o s f s m i m o s f d m i m o s f the mean value of daly for each scenario expressed as log10 was then calculated as 12 d a l y m e a n m e a n l o g 10 d a l y m i m o s f 2 9 quality assurance and data analysis to verify the accuracy of the e coli enumeration an additional sample was inoculated with e coli atcc 25922 concentration of pathogens in the inoculum was determined by turbidity using a mcfarland standard a solution of 0 5 was used indicating a concentration of 1 5 108 cfu ml 1 analysis of the inoculated sample detected a concentration of 1 8 107 cfu ml 1 in the case of ascaris data obtained from the field analysis were concentration adjusted assuming that full recovery of eggs was not achieved distribution fitting was done using r software r foundation for statistical computing 2013 and the package fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 for both organisms a normal distribution on log transformed data was used see table 1 environmental samples with no detected microorganism concentrations were set to the detection limit 100 cfu g 1 for distribution fitting in the qmra model a monte carlo simulation was used in each step by randomly sampling 10 000 times a value within the range or distribution used for a given parameter sensitivity analysis on the decay model tm for the consumer and farmer scenarios was run using the r package multisensi bidot et al 2018 and with parameter values in the same range as the qmra model to simulate additional uncertainty see supplementary material for details 3 results 3 1 environmental sampling 3 1 1 indicator bacteria salmonella spp was not detected detection limit 1 in 25 g in any of the dried faecal sludge samples analysed n 15 and was not investigated in other sludge soil and vegetable samples the raw faecal sludge n 3 contained e coli concentrations of 5 6 log10 cfu g 1 while the dried sludge which was sampled over 2 years n 33 showed high variability with e coli ranging from below detection limit to 6 4 log10 cfu g 1 faecal sludge table 2 enterococcus spp was detected in all dried faecal sludge samples at an average concentration of 4 9 log10 cfu g 1 in soil samples the highest concentrations of e coli and enterococcus were found in fields fertilised with chicken manure fig 2 no consistent difference in bacterial concentration was observed between the two soil depths enterococcus spp was found on all vegetables mean 5 2 log10 cfu g 1 while e coli was detected in five out of seven vegetable samples mean 2 3 log10 cfu g 1 e coli was detected in crops even when not detected in the faecal sludge fertilised soil in which these crops were growing 3 1 2 ascaris viable ascaris eggs were detected in all samples the highest concentration was detected in raw sludge mean 66 eggs g 1 52 egg viability as expected mean concentration was lower in dried sludge 21 eggs g 1 53 viability and sludge fertilised soil 15 eggs g 1 63 viability the dried faecal sludge stored on two farms n 2 had concentrations of viable eggs of 11 and 43 eggs g 1 which is within the range measured in dry sludge at the plant fig 2 however ascaris was also detected in fields fertilised with chicken manure 7 eggs g 1 43 viability and npk 5 eggs g 1 23 viability vegetable samples were found to be contaminated with cabbages having an average of 172 viable eggs per item 0 4 egg g 1 67 viability while onion leaves and amaranth had an average of 17 eggs g 1 65 viability 3 2 worker scenario the workers schedule with different duties resulted in a daily risk of infection that was higher for ehec 3 8 24 depending on duty than for ascaris 0 03 4 4 however the pattern was similar for both pathogens with generic duties giving the least risk followed by working at drying beds working at sedimentation beds and working at the inlet thus raw sludge gave the highest risk of infection table 4 the probability of illness over different time frames 24 30 and 90 days of the workers rolling schedule in the base b and mitigation m scenario showed that workers reached 99 probability of illness from ehec within one month of working whereas for ascaris one year of working was required to reach 99 probability of illness table 4 mitigation measures had most effect for ascaris decreasing the probability of infection over a 3 month period from 85 to 36 3 3 farmer scenario the qmra model resulted in yearly ingestion of 5 9 g soil considering the first 10 days after the two fertilisation events as high intensity work activity average 60 mg day 1 and the remaining days as low intensity work average 12 mg day 1 for farmers the field data model fm estimated yearly risk of illness from ascaris at 70 and from ehec at 26 mitigation by using a face mask during the first 10 days from fertilisation reduced the risk of illness to 12 for ascaris and 21 for e coli the decay model tm predicted a yearly risk of illness for farmers from ehec of 1 2 for the base scenario and 0 8 for the mitigated scenario yearly risk of illness from ascaris in the decay model tm was estimated at 1 4 in the base scenario and 1 0 in the mitigated scenario for the decay model tm field data from the same farm gave a yearly risk odds ratio or of 2 8 for soil fertilised with sludge mean 3 9 viable eggs g 1 60 80 days from fertilisation and without faecal sludge but npk 1 2 viable eggs g 1 60 80 days from fertilisation 3 4 consumer scenario the field model based on concentrations detected in samples of vegetables predicted a 100 yearly probability of illness caused by ehec and ascaris infection for leafy vegetables n 7 probability of illness for a single event was estimated at 19 7 for ehec and 11 for ascaris using concentrations found in cabbage n 3 the annual and weekly risks were much lower 0 in both time frames for ehec and 26 and 0 06 respectively for ascaris the theoretical model predicted a risk for ehec of almost 0 while for ascaris the yearly probability of illness from consuming leafy vegetables was estimated at 64 and 19 for a shorter 70 84 days and longer period 150 200 days of sludge drying respectively while for cabbage the probability of illness was 15 and 2 for the same shorter and longer drying periods respectively 4 discussion 4 1 environmental sampling of the faecal sludge management and reuse chain 4 1 1 sludge and soil the e coli concentration in raw faecal sludge mean 5 6 log10 g 1 was slightly lower than found in pit latrines in kampala 6 7 log10 g 1 whereas the ascaris egg concentration mean 66 18 eggs g 1 was higher than reported for pit latrines 19 25 eggs g 1 kabenge et al 2017 drying of the sludge lowered the concentration of ascaris eggs to 21 23 eggs g 1 although with rather high variation in concentration fig 2 which may reflect variations in raw sludge or indicate that the sludge had been subjected to different storage times navarro et al 2009 found that even with different treatments helminth eggs are likely to remain in faecal sludge since ascaris eggs can persist at moisture content down to 5 senecal et al 2020 drying may not be efficient for ascaris sanitisation a study by kone et al 2007 investigating faecal sludge drying in a similar set up observed a reduction from 60 to 22 38 eggs g 1 total solids when drying from 3 to 20 total solids with viability around 50 which is in agreement with others navarro et al 2009 seidu et al 2008 and the present study to reach who standards who 2006b or class b sludge in south africa department water and agriculture of south africa 2006 1 egg g 1 and based on decay of 0 0095 log10 viable eggs day 1 table 1 the raw faecal sludge would need to be dried for 190 days field data points with known sludge age n 12 were used to estimate a decay rate the result 0 0093 day 1 with r2 0 36 was compatible with the log decay rate used in the tm 0 0095 day 1 a curve fit on predicted y versus measured log values x was also produced y 0 38x 0 80 r2 0 37 concentration of ascaris eggs in soil fertilised with sludge on the farms sampled had a mean of 9 5 viable eggs g 1 for samples obtained from the same farm sludge manure and npk fertilised fields had a mean concentration of 3 9 2 9 and 1 2 eggs g 1 respectively and differences were not significant p 0 47 the detection of ascaris eggs in soils that were not fertilised with sewage sludge may be explained by residual eggs from previous sludge applications or other potential sources of pathogens e g irrigation free ranging pigs the bacterial sampling also indicated sources other than sludge application table 2 however for bacterial contamination there are more likely sources among wild and domestic fauna even based on few data the difference in soil concentration indicates that the last sludge application could contribute up to 70 of the ascaris egg concentration in soil however when considering the overall true risk to farmers and consumers the background levels need to be included in most cases 19 22 e coli was not detected 100 cfu g 1 in soil fertilised with faecal sludge but was found in soil fertilised with manure or npk a study on farmer exposure in ghana antwi agyei et al 2016 reported an e coli concentration in soil of 2 3 log10 cfu g 1 which is similar to that found in this study 4 1 2 crops escherichia coli was detected on leafy vegetables in an average concentration of 1 6 log10 cfu g 1 which is similar to that reported for leafy vegetables in ghana 102 faecal coliform bacteria g 1 amoah et al 2007a it also agrees with the estimated survival time of coliforms on crops of 15 30 days who 2006b p 46 e coli was detectable on vegetables despite not being present in the soils where the vegetables were grown indicating other potential sources of contamination as the survival in soil is expected to be higher than on vegetables oliveira et al 2012 ascaris concentration on vegetables 11 1 9 viable eggs g 1 on leafy vegetables and 0 30 0 18 viable eggs g 1 cabbage was of the same magnitude as reported previously in a similar context 2 7 eggs g 1 spring onions and 0 4 eggs g 1 cabbage amoah et al 2006 the concentration on leafy vegetables was very close to that in the dried sludge table 2 this would represent rather high soil contamination despite harvesting being performed in very controlled ways to avoid soil contamination which may not be the case during large scale routine harvest since concentrations on cabbage are counts per unit weight considering only the outer leaves or the whole cabbage as done in this study would change estimates significantly 4 1 3 sampling strategy unlike e coli enterococcus spp was present in concentrations above the detection limit in all matrices analysed this may indicate slower decay and or other sources of contamination and suggests that enterococcus spp may be a better indicator of soil and crop contamination by persistent pathogens however enterococcus spp may also be of environmental origin so distinguishing enterococcus spp of faecal origin e faecalis and e faecium is required for accurate detection of faecal contamination bartz et al 2017 e coli may serve as a model for gram negative bacterial pathogens e g salmonella and shigella 4 2 risk characterisation in all scenarios the burden of disease expressed as years of life lost per 10 000 people table 5 was at least two orders of magnitude higher than the who tolerable additional disease burden of dalys lost 0 01 per 10 000 or 10 6 pppy table 4 and 5 the burden of disease was below the who value only for ehec when consuming cabbage based on field data and for both crops in the tm the latter due to assumed decay in the environment a target of 1 of local prevalence 4 5 for ascaris 25 for e coli risk to farmers as previously proposed mara 2011 mara and sleigh 2010 may be a more meaningful level for acceptable risk figs 5 and 6 show the risk of illness across the faecal sludge treatment reuse chain the contrasting risk estimates from the fm and tm depend on the different concentrations of pathogens measured versus assumed at each step of the treatment reuse chain fig 3 these differences are caused by considering in the tm only the last sludge application not including possible additional sources of pathogens and or residual eggs from previous fertilisation occurring in the field the tm also suffers from uncertainties in the application rate of sludge and migration rate from soil to crop fitting the tm to field data was tested where possible section 4 2 4 4 2 1 worker scenario dividing the scenario into daily duties showed that risk varied significantly depending on work tasks at the treatment plant unsurprisingly working with raw faecal sludge posed the highest risk and should be given priority in mitigation efforts evaluating the risk over time showed that while the yearly risk of illness remained almost 100 for both pathogens studied mitigation effects were detectable in a shorter time frame and more prominent for ascaris table 3 in uganda the prevalence of ascaris in workers managing drainage channels at another wwtp bugolobi is reported to be 2 3 and that in workers managing faecal sludge 0 fuhrimann et al 2016a overall prevalence of ascaris in uganda is estimated to be 4 5 karagiannis voules et al 2015 the qmra for 30 and 90 days in the present study estimated a risk of infection of 40 and 85 respectively considering that workers at lubigi wwfstp are dewormed every 90 days this could be considered the highest risk of infection the results support the deworming interval table 4 even considering the shorter time frame the estimated risk of illness was over 10 fold higher than reported for bugolobi wwtp it was not stated whether the bugolobi workers received deworming similar to workers at the lubigi plant fuhrimann et al 2016a in a survey on faecal sludge workers the self reported prevalence of diarrhoea over a 14 day recall period was 32 8 fuhrimann et al 2016b while a review by thorn and karekes 2001 reported prevalence of gastrointestinal problems in wwtp workers of 8 germany in 1954 and 13 sweden in 1978 using a time frame of two weeks which would cover the duration of illness in 99 of cases for ehec table 1 a risk of illness of 88 for the base scenario and 61 for the mitigated scenario was estimated from the models i e much higher than the self reported value for both pathogens the higher probability of illness calculated via qmra compared with prevalence reported by others could be caused by overestimation of involuntary ingestion host characteristics such as age and immunity could also play a role walker et al 2013 p 165 holland 2009 and may not be accounted for in the dose response curve in the studies cited use of protection measures was not mentioned but could explain the lower prevalence of infection 4 2 2 farmer scenario in a study by fuhrimann et al 2016a 25 of farmers self reported cases of diarrhoea over a period of two weeks in comparison the qmra over the same period predicted a probability of illness from ehec of 4 fm and below 0 01 tm the lower estimate fm may be partly explained by ehec being only one of many possible causes of diarrhoea and partly by underestimation of involuntary ingestion for farmers that the general concentration of e coli was analysed and assumed to represent a fraction of ehec is a matter of uncertainty for both models fm and tm for ascaris risk estimates diverged significantly between the tm and fm due to the different egg concentration in soil used in the two models 9 5 viable eggs g 1 fm and 0 24 viable eggs g 1 tm several scenarios were explored in order to reconcile the two models using the considered parameters within a reasonable range did not lead to a convincing result the difference between the two models could be caused by uncertainties connected to the parameters used in the tm decay dynamics in sludge and soil sludge application rate analytical recovery time passed between fertilisation but also by assuming only one source of pathogens the existence of other sources was indicated by the concentration of e coli and enterococcus found in npk fertilised fields but also by the limited difference between concentrations found in dried sludge 11 viable eggs g 1 and soil mean of 9 5 viable eggs g 1 across all fields despite these considerations given the limited amount of sampled farms further conclusions cannot be drawn additional studies perhaps in the form of controlled experiments are required to better understand the application and fate of ascaris in farm soil the yearly risk odds ratio or of 2 8 was higher than the value of 1 7 reported by tran thi et al 2017 but lower than the 3 5 5 4 reported in other studies amoah et al 2016 blumenthal and peasey 2002 pham duc et al 2013 4 2 3 consumer scenario for ehec the fm and tm produced contradictory yearly risk estimates e g risk was negligible in tm due to the fast decay assumed bartz et al 2017 and 100 in fm due to the detection of e coli on vegetables mean 2 6 log10 cfu g 1 these differences could be reconciled considering that water used for irrigation can also be a source of pollution amoah et al 2007a and that contamination may occur between farm and market 80 of vegetables sampled at a market in ghana were contaminated with e coli 0 6 3 8 log10 g 1 antwi agyei et al 2015 the estimated 100 probability of illness from ehec in the fm was significantly higher than that estimated previously for côte d ivoire which has a yearly infection risk of 12 23 kouamé et al 2017 in conclusion for ehec the qmra model based on extrapolation from e coli field data and weekly consumption indicated an almost certain risk of illness on a yearly basis but the source of this pathogen is unlikely to be the sludge used on fields for ascaris the slower decay in soil would theoretically allow this pathogen to survive and be present on the crop at harvest the divergence between tm and fm in soil concentration estimates fig 3 also affected crop concentration and risk estimate the fm predicted a yearly probability of illness of 100 based on concentrations found on leafy vegetables and 26 based on concentrations found on cabbage the tm prediction was 66 for leafy vegetables and 19 for cabbages the results from both models indicated that leafy vegetables pose a several fold higher risk than cabbage this is linked to the higher ascaris egg concentration found on leafy vegetables 11 4 viable eggs g 1 compared with cabbage 0 30 viable eggs g 1 both models showed that the crop chosen for the qmra may also be very influential for the outcome leafy vegetables showed higher concentration and risks regarding cabbages it should also be considered that while the pathogen concentrations on external leaves may be similar the greater weight of the inner cabbage head results in much lower counts per unit weight 4 2 4 fitting field data despite the significant differences in outcome between the two models an effort was made to adjust parameters to fit the tm to field data for ascaris the calibrated model was considered over a time frame of one month while for ehec the time frame was two weeks these periods were chosen based on the assumed duration of illness table 1 for the workers scenario matching the national ascaris prevalence of 4 5 would require daily ingestion just lower than that calculated in the mitigated scenario for activities with raw sludge 20 mg and for dried sludge 10 mg for ehec a 33 risk would be matched by ingestion of 6 mg of raw sludge assuming the same concentration in dried sludge as in the base scenario for the farmers and consumers scenarios fitting the tm proved more difficult in particular fitting the concentration found in soil with reasonable sludge application rate was not possible ascaris decay rate in soil and residual eggs from previous fertilisation were areas of great uncertainty assuming ascaris levels found in npk fertilised fields as a background concentration field data fitted with a decay rate of 90 t90 at 234 days for the tm the background concentration was not included but a more conservative approach was taken on decay t90 between 120 500 days this decay should produce a residual load after several fertilisations of around 0 45 viable egg g 1 migration rate from soil to crop was estimated based on limited data points obtained from field data but it would be beneficial to do further research on the topic a model reflecting the full risks would probably require inclusion of additional sources of pathogens e g via irrigation and would benefit from a larger sample and closer monitoring to determine key parameters rapp rm cres the development of such a combined fertilisation irrigation model could be the objective of further studies 4 2 5 uncertainty in qmra for involuntary ingestion estimates were based on published literature and may be considered reasonable but it is not known how accurately they describe the specific context acquired immunity and differences in age or gender were not considered in the model unlike in other studies karavarsamis and hamilton 2010 the infection to illness rate was modelled using a single value 0 35 for ehec and pert 0 15 0 27 0 39 for ascaris in future qmra validation with health data from workers could reduce these uncertainties statistical methods used may also have a significant impact poma et al 2019 as may dose response parameters kundu et al 2014 qmra is mostly used for estimating single exposure events but it would be worth exploring its use for continuous exposure the data collected during interviews and site visits were not sufficient to accurately estimate fertiliser application rate rapp and pathogen migration from soil to crop rm the tm was not able to explain the majority of the ascaris concentration found in soil improvement work on the model should include other possible sources of pathogens apart from sludge and residual eggs from previous applications ascaris survival in soil was modelled using literature data but given the wide range of available decay rates further context specific studies would be beneficial running two models based on different inputs led to different risk estimates indicating the importance of contextualising qmra with local data in combination with published data 4 3 risk mitigation four types of mitigation measures were identified improved treatment extension of drying limitation in the use of sludge application control limitation for certain crops use of personal protection equipment mask face shields shoes gloves and behavioural change for workers along the faecal sludge treatment reuse chain dumba et al 2013 strunz et al 2014 fig 4 4 3 1 worker scenario reducing involuntary ingestion could be done at two points during work activities and during eating at the workplace protective equipment should be used especially at the inlet and sedimentation beds the estimated daily risk of illness would then drop from 24 to 17 ehec inlet and from 22 to 13 ehec sedimentation beds since a face mask is difficult to wear for hours in a warm climate a face shield may be better option it could also be cleaned and reused risks from eating could be reduced by revising hygiene practices and lunch location and banning food consumption near the beds however the impact of these measures is difficult to predict given the numerous uncertainties involved ascaris risk of illness during the 90 days between deworming could be decreased from 58 to 18 reduction in the risk from ehec may only be detected over a 14 day period reduction from 88 to 60 4 3 2 farmer scenario sensitivity analysis showed that sludge drying time range 70 200 days was the main factor in controlling ehec infection global sensitivity index 0 27 and ascaris gsi 0 34 a first mitigation approach would consist of extending the drying period of the sludge at the wwtp or at the farm after purchase another set of mitigation strategies could act at farmer behaviour level particularly during the days with intense work in contact with soil protective equipment to reduce involuntary ingestion by 90 would decrease ascaris infection based on field data from 62 to 22 but would have no major impact on ehec infection 22 to 21 previous studies have shown that shoes and improved personal hygiene may reduce the risk of illness strunz et al 2014 4 3 3 consumer scenario sensitivity analysis showed that several factors influenced the final risk estimates for consumers for ascaris controllable factors drying time t application rate rapp washing rw ingestion i were responsible for 92 of the results gsi a 0 321 t 0 29 i 0 05 rw 0 26 thus mitigation efforts should concentrate on extending drying time illness probability reduction from 58 to 30 promoting appropriate sludge application rates in agriculture and good produce washing practices by consumers restriction on crop type was not tested numerically but the high variation in pathogen concentrations reported for different crops suggests that it could have a significant impact on the final risk of illness these mitigations would be aligned with guidelines for south africa class b sludge with the following additional measures sludge not used in growing vegetables to be eaten raw crop that touches the ground should not be harvested within 14 months after last sludge application it is also recommended not to exceed an application rate of 10 ton per ha and year for ehec the mitigation focus should be on the final part of the treatment reuse chain from harvest to point of sale by avoiding additional pollution most likely coming from water conclusions the concentrations of faecal indicator organisms and pathogens detected in sludge soil and vegetables suggested that the latest sludge application plays an important role but is not the sole source of pathogens along the reuse chain qmra estimates based on field sampling and theoretical decay calculations differed indicating the importance of contextualising risk assessment qmra models based on field data showed that yearly risk of infection was high for all groups considered workers farmers consumers qmra based on a decay model showed high yearly risk for ascaris but not for ehec ehec from faecal sludge is unlikely to be present on harvested crops possible mitigation strategies for workers and farmers showed a reduction in monthly risk of 30 70 sludge drying time was found to be an important factor in the farmer and consumer scenarios impact of 25 30 on risk estimates and is therefore a potential mitigation tool declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17041,reuse of faecal sludge in agriculture has many potential benefits but also poses risks to human health to better understand the potential risks quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra was performed for three population groups in kampala uganda wastewater and faecal sludge treatment plant workers farmers using faecal sludge and consumers of faecal sludge fertilised vegetables two models were applied for farmers and consumers one based on pathogen concentrations from field sampling of sludge soils and vegetables and one based on theoretical pathogen contribution from the last sludge application including decay and soil to crop transfer of pathogens the risk was evaluated for two pathogens enterohaemorrhagic e coli ehec and ascaris lumbricoides the field data on sludge soil and vegetables indicated that the last application of faecal sludge was not the sole pathogen source correspondingly the model using field data resulted in higher risks for farmers and consumers than the theoretical model assuming risk from sludge only except when negligible for both for farmers the yearly risk of illness based on measured concentrations was 26 from ehec and 70 from ascaris compared with 1 2 and 1 4 respectively considering the theoretically assumed contribution from the sludge for consumers the risk of illness based on field samples was higher from consumption of leafy vegetables 100 from ehec 99 from ascaris than from consumption of cabbages negligible for ehec 26 from ascaris with the theoretical model the risk of illness from ehec was negligible for both crops whereas the risk of illness from ascaris was 64 and 16 for leafy vegetables and cabbage respectively for treatment plant workers yearly risk of illness was 100 from ehec and 99 4 from ascaris mitigation practices evaluated could reduce the relative risk by 30 70 these results can help guide treatment and use of faecal sludge in kampala to protect plant workers farmers and consumers

consumers of treated faecal sludge from the lubigi plant based on pathogen concentrations measured along the faecal sludge management service chain two models were built for the analysis a field model

346939n 32 544270e 1140 m asl is managed by the ugandan national water and sewerage corporation and has been in operation since 2015 it has the capacity to treat 400 m3 of faecal sludge and 5000 m3 of wastewater per day faecal sludge from the city and surrounding areas is collected by vacuum trucks from on site sanitation systems schoebitz et al 2016 at the plant the faecal sludge goes through a three stage process initial screening sedimentation in two settling tanks which operate alternately one on duty and one on standby and drying in covered sand beds after a storage period intended to be at least six months the faecal sludge is sold as agricultural fertiliser however due to high demand customers often collect the dried sludge before the intended storage period 2 2 field sampling a recent review of 22 qmras performed on countries in ssa identified gaps in data collection van abel and taylor 2018 to overcome this limitation in this study specific field sampling was performed for enumeration determination of microorganisms samples of raw faecal sludge n 3 1 occasion dried faecal sludge n 33 3 occasions soil n 22 3 occasions and crops n 7 2 occasions were collected in july 2018 february 2019 july 2019 and january 2020 for faecal sludge samples the sampling procedure was in line with epa standards epa 1989 for each drying bed three samples each made of three pooled subsamples were collected in zip lock bags stored in an ice cooled container and transported to the laboratory at makerere microbiology for analysis two batches of unused dried faecal sludge found at one farm were also sampled soil samples were collected from five fields on three different farms three of the fields were fertilised with faecal sludge from lubigi wwfstp one with npk and one with chicken manure pooled samples of soil 4 subsamples adding up to 50 80 g were taken from the top layer 0 10 cm in the field following a random location stratified using a regular grid stored in zip lock bags and kept at ambient temperature during transport to the laboratory three farms for which contact details were available which were also willing to participate in the project were all included in the sampling due to their limited number three sets of samples were collected from vegetable crops from cabbages brassica oleracea growing in a field fertilised with npk n 3 from amaranthus spp amaranth locally known as dodo n 3 mollee et al 2017 sogbohossou et al 2015 and from red creole onion allium cepa in a field fertilised with sludge n 2 all sampled vegetables were randomly picked and stored in sterile plastic bags during transport to the laboratory for analysis the data on field samples were used in the qmra table 2 2 3 laboratory analysis the field samples were analysed for escherichia coli enterococcus spp ascaris lumbricoides and salmonella spp the e coli and enterococcus spp concentrations in all matrices faecal sludge soil vegetables were determined on 10 g of material serially diluted 1 9 with buffered peptone water chromocult coliform ec agar was used for the detection of e coli and bile esculin azide agar for the detection of enterococcus spp by plating 0 1 ml giving a detection limit of 100 cfu g 1 material from three dilutions and incubating for 24 2 hours at 37 c for ascaris the method proposed by the water research commission of south africa was used moodley et al 2008 analysing eggs in 10 g of sludge the method involves assessment of viable eggs by visual inspection under the microscope after 3 weeks of incubation for detection of salmonella spp samples of dried sludge from one sampling occasion n 15 were enriched 25 g in rappaport vassiliadis broth and enumerated on xylos lysine deoxycholate agar 2 4 qmra strategy framework this qmra followed the conventional steps of hazard identification exposure assessment dose response and risk characterisation haas et al 2014 karavarsamis and hamilton 2010 mara and sleigh 2010 who 2006b the occupational risk caused by involuntary ingestion was estimated for workers on the faecal sludge line at the wwfstp farmers working in fields where faecal sludge is used as a fertiliser and end consumers of raw vegetables grown in fields fertilised with faecal sludge table 1 to assess the contribution from faecal sludge reuse relative to the pathogen concentrations already present in the environment and the risks to farmers and consumers field and theoretical models were applied fig 1 measured pathogen concentrations in faecal sludge soil and vegetables were used in a field model fm to estimate risks while measured pathogen concentrations in raw sludge were used as initial input in a theoretical model tm and literature values for decay and migration were used to derive concentrations in soil and on vegetables 2 5 hazard identification among infectious diseases transmitted through faecal contamination diarrhoea accounts for most disability adjusted life years dalys in uganda mainly in children and the elderly while soil transmitted helminths are the most prevalent pathogens institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme 2018 this study assessed the risk from enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli ehec and ascaris lumbricoides pathogens posing risks for all three groups included in the qmra together with rotavirus and calicivirus pathogenic e coli are the most frequently identified global cause of gastrointestinal illnesses in children below 5 years of age fletcher et al 2013 responsible for more than 50 of all diarrhoeal deaths lanata et al 2013 abba et al 2009 ehec has been identified as a cause of diarrhoea in children aged below five years in uganda but is less common than other e coli pathotypes masiga et al 2020 musiime et al 2009 tumwine et al 2003 due to the milder more chronic nature of infection ascaris lumbricoides and other soil transmitted helminths contribute less to dalys compared with diarrhoea institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme 2018 however helminth infection can result in longer term impairment of mental and physical development hotez et al 2006 jukes et al 2002 ascaris eggs can survive for months to years under severe environmental conditions dryzer et al 2019 stott et al 2003 de faria et al 2017 and this pathogen is therefore suggested for qmra in regions where it is prevalent who 2006b the risk assessment in the present study thus included one pathogen persistent to treatment ascaris lumbricoides but which causes less severe disease and one pathogen more sensitive to treatment ehec but which can cause severe disease and which has a confirmed low infectious dose teunis et al 2004 tilden et al 1996 stressing its importance as a bacterial pathogen samples of faecal sludge soil and vegetables were analysed for e coli as described above table 2 and it was assumed that 8 consisted of ehec howard et al 2006 in the ascaris analysis a recovery rate of 0 85 was assumed for sludge karkashan et al 2015 and 0 37 for soil steinbaum et al 2017 2 6 exposure assessment 2 6 1 wwfttp worker scenario there is growing concern about the health conditions of sanitation workers world bank et al 2019 this scenario focused on the operational staff 11 individuals at lubigi wwfstp regarding their exposure during faecal sludge management in previous research by makerere university students five different activities were identified as potentially hazardous table 3 offloading the raw faecal sludge from the truck working at the grit removal station moving the faecal sludge from drying beds to storage beds loading the truck with dried faecal sludge and eating near the drying beds kiffe and wycliffe 2016 using literature data on occupational exposure schonning et al 2007 u s environmental protection agency 2018 2017 1997 westrell et al 2004 involuntary ingestion during each activity was estimated after site visits and interviews with the workers these activities were linked to four duties performed by the wwfstp workers generic site supervision events per person per year pppy n 43 working at the inlet n 31 pppy working at the grit and settling tanks n 175 pppy and working at the drying beds n 91 pppy involuntary daily ingestion i of faecal sludge for each duty was estimated as the sum of sludge ingested during the activities performed during that day ingestion mg day 1 per duty type ig i s d was estimated using a normal distribution table 3 in addition reduced involuntary ingestion igm im sm dm due to mitigation wearing a mask and improved hygiene in eating eating location and hand washing was assessed assuming that the measures reduced ingestion by 90 during working activities and 50 during eating the daily pathogen dose dw eggs or cfu day 1 for a duty i e worker on that shift was calculated as 1 d w i g i s d i n g e s t i o n c rs ds concentration ω a e fraction of infective pathogens where c is concentration of organism e coli or viable ascaris egg in raw sludge crs for duties at inlet and grit and settling tanks or in dried faecal sludge cds for generic duties and at the drying beds and ω e is the fraction of e coli assumed to be ehec 2 6 2 farmer scenario this scenario focused on farmers using the faecal sludge as fertiliser and assessed the exposure from involuntary ingestion of contaminated soil a general estimate of farmland affected by this practice was made considering that lubigi wwfstp is likely to sell 1450 2900 m3 of faecal sludge from drying beds per year personal communication july 2019 this could be spread on an area of 67 136 ha of farmland involving 700 1500 farmers assuming a wet density of 1 4 kg l 1 strande et al 2014 an average total solids rate of 30 lindberg and rost 2018 and 10 ton ha 1 application per year in line with south african regulations and an average of 11 farmers per hectare julien et al 2019 farmers activities were divided into two types activities involving intense contact with soil performed in the first 10 days after fertilisation ifh and activities involving less contact with soil performed on the other days ifl the involuntary ingestion mg day 1 for the two activities was estimated with a distribution as pert 0 0467 0 0642 0 0814 and pert 0 005 0 0123 0 0205 respectively table 1 a mitigation scenario with farmers wearing a face cover during the first 10 days was also considered this measure was

navarro et al 2009 formulated a dose response model for ascaris based on epidemiological data collected in mexico blumenthal et al 1996 cifuentes et al 1993 which has been used by most qmra studies since 2009 and also in this study dose response models crockett et al 1996 haas et al 1999 strachan et al 2001 have continuously been tested and refitted against outbreak data for ehec where doses are known strachan et al 2005 teunis et al 2004 2009 the most recent assessment and fitting of models to the global e coli o157 h7 outbreak teunis et al 2008 concluded that infectivity may vary widely between strains and that the best fitting model is a beta poisson model using a beta binomial likelihood both the ascaris and ehec models in this study used the simplified beta poisson equation 7 p i d 1 1 d β α with median infection as 8 n 50 β 2 1 α 1 where pi represents the probability of infection for an ingested dose d in each event the probability of illness was then calculated using an infection to illness rate λ 9 p i l l d p i d λ in the case of ehec the rate for e coli o157 h7 λ 0 35 was used machdar et al 2013 considering the heterogeneity of illness for ascaris walker et al 2013 λ was modelled as a pert distribution 0 15 0 27 0 39 dold and holland 2011 mara and bos 2009 the annual probability of illness p i l l y r was then calculated as 10a p i l l y r a 1 1 p i l l n or 10b p i l l y r b 1 1 n 1 p i l l where n is number of events days of exposure equation 10a was used with a constant infection to illness rate λ across events and equation 10b with a variable probability of illness note that the model considers probability of infection at any event as independent from other events with no immunity developed after infection in the consumer scenario a single portion 30 g 52 events was taken as the minimum consumption unit of vegetables and assumed to occur on a weekly basis 2 8 risk characterisation the disease burden was calculated and expressed in dalys per 10 000 persons and year lopez et al 2006 mara and bos 2009 murray et al 2012 the who threshold of 10 6 daly would correspond to 0 01 years lost per 10 000 persons a year and a 10 4 daly pppy to 1 year lost per 10 000 persons a year outcome of illness in terms of proportion with mild mi moderate mo severe s and fatal f severity weighting and duration of each outcome used for calculating dalys eq 11 were based on previous studies katukiza 2013 pullan et al 2014 for each scenario the probability of illness from equation 10 was multiplied by the frequency f severity s and duration d of each outcome of illness as 11 d a l y m i m o s f p i l l y r f m i m o s f s m i m o s f d m i m o s f the mean value of daly for each scenario expressed as log10 was then calculated as 12 d a l y m e a n m e a n l o g 10 d a l y m i m o s f 2 9 quality assurance and data analysis to verify the accuracy of the e coli enumeration an additional sample was inoculated with e coli atcc 25922 concentration of pathogens in the inoculum was determined by turbidity using a mcfarland standard a solution of 0 5 was used indicating a concentration of 1 5 108 cfu ml 1 analysis of the inoculated sample detected a concentration of 1 8 107 cfu ml 1 in the case of ascaris data obtained from the field analysis were concentration adjusted assuming that full recovery of eggs was not achieved distribution fitting was done using r software r foundation for statistical computing 2013 and the package fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 for both organisms a normal distribution on log transformed data was used see table 1 environmental samples with no detected microorganism concentrations were set to the detection limit 100 cfu g 1 for distribution fitting in the qmra model a monte carlo simulation was used in each step by randomly sampling 10 000 times a value within the range or distribution used for a given parameter sensitivity analysis on the decay model tm for the consumer and farmer scenarios was run using the r package multisensi bidot et al 2018 and with parameter values in the same range as the qmra model to simulate additional uncertainty see supplementary material for details 3 results 3 1 environmental sampling 3 1 1 indicator bacteria salmonella spp was not detected detection limit 1 in 25 g in any of the dried faecal sludge samples analysed n 15 and was not investigated in other sludge soil and vegetable samples the raw faecal sludge n 3 contained e coli concentrations of 5 6 log10 cfu g 1 while the dried sludge which was sampled over 2 years n 33 showed high variability with e coli ranging from below detection limit to 6 4 log10 cfu g 1 faecal sludge table 2 enterococcus spp was detected in all dried faecal sludge samples at an average concentration of 4 9 log10 cfu g 1 in soil samples the highest concentrations of e coli and enterococcus were found in fields fertilised with chicken manure fig 2 no consistent difference in bacterial concentration was observed between the two soil depths enterococcus spp was found on all vegetables mean 5 2 log10 cfu g 1 while e coli was detected in five out of seven vegetable samples mean 2 3 log10 cfu g 1 e coli was detected in crops even when not detected in the faecal sludge fertilised soil in which these crops were growing 3 1 2 ascaris viable ascaris eggs were detected in all samples the highest concentration was detected in raw sludge mean 66 eggs g 1 52 egg viability as expected mean concentration was lower in dried sludge 21 eggs g 1 53 viability and sludge fertilised soil 15 eggs g 1 63 viability the dried faecal sludge stored on two farms n 2 had concentrations of viable eggs of 11 and 43 eggs g 1 which is within the range measured in dry sludge at the plant fig 2 however ascaris was also detected in fields fertilised with chicken manure 7 eggs g 1 43 viability and npk 5 eggs g 1 23 viability vegetable samples were found to be contaminated with cabbages having an average of 172 viable eggs per item 0 4 egg g 1 67 viability while onion leaves and amaranth had an average of 17 eggs g 1 65 viability 3 2 worker scenario the workers schedule with different duties resulted in a daily risk of infection that was higher for ehec 3 8 24 depending on duty than for ascaris 0 03 4 4 however the pattern was similar for both pathogens with generic duties giving the least risk followed by working at drying beds working at sedimentation beds and working at the inlet thus raw sludge gave the highest risk of infection table 4 the probability of illness over different time frames 24 30 and 90 days of the workers rolling schedule in the base b and mitigation m scenario showed that workers reached 99 probability of illness from ehec within one month of working whereas for ascaris one year of working was required to reach 99 probability of illness table 4 mitigation measures had most effect for ascaris decreasing the probability of infection over a 3 month period from 85 to 36 3 3 farmer scenario the qmra model resulted in yearly ingestion of 5 9 g soil considering the first 10 days after the two fertilisation events as high intensity work activity average 60 mg day 1 and the remaining days as low intensity work average 12 mg day 1 for farmers the field data model fm estimated yearly risk of illness from ascaris at 70 and from ehec at 26 mitigation by using a face mask during the first 10 days from fertilisation reduced the risk of illness to 12 for ascaris and 21 for e coli the decay model tm predicted a yearly risk of illness for farmers from ehec of 1 2 for the base scenario and 0 8 for the mitigated scenario yearly risk of illness from ascaris in the decay model tm was estimated at 1 4 in the base scenario and 1 0 in the mitigated scenario for the decay model tm field data from the same farm gave a yearly risk odds ratio or of 2 8 for soil fertilised with sludge mean 3 9 viable eggs g 1 60 80 days from fertilisation and without faecal sludge but npk 1 2 viable eggs g 1 60 80 days from fertilisation 3 4 consumer scenario the field model based on concentrations detected in samples of vegetables predicted a 100 yearly probability of illness caused by ehec and ascaris infection for leafy vegetables n 7 probability of illness for a single event was estimated at 19 7 for ehec and 11 for ascaris using concentrations found in cabbage n 3 the annual and weekly risks were much lower 0 in both time frames for ehec and 26 and 0 06 respectively for ascaris the theoretical model predicted a risk for ehec of almost 0 while for ascaris the yearly probability of illness from consuming leafy vegetables was estimated at 64 and 19 for a shorter 70 84 days and longer period 150 200 days of sludge drying respectively while for cabbage the probability of illness was 15 and 2 for the same shorter and longer drying periods respectively 4 discussion 4 1 environmental sampling of the faecal sludge management and reuse chain 4 1 1 sludge and soil the e coli concentration in raw faecal sludge mean 5 6 log10 g 1 was slightly lower than found in pit latrines in kampala 6 7 log10 g 1 whereas the ascaris egg concentration mean 66 18 eggs g 1 was higher than reported for pit latrines 19 25 eggs g 1 kabenge et al 2017 drying of the sludge lowered the concentration of ascaris eggs to 21 23 eggs g 1 although with rather high variation in concentration fig 2 which may reflect variations in raw sludge or indicate that the sludge had been subjected to different storage times navarro et al 2009 found that even with different treatments helminth eggs are likely to remain in faecal sludge since ascaris eggs can persist at moisture content down to 5 senecal et al 2020 drying may not be efficient for ascaris sanitisation a study by kone et al 2007 investigating faecal sludge drying in a similar set up observed a reduction from 60 to 22 38 eggs g 1 total solids when drying from 3 to 20 total solids with viability around 50 which is in agreement with others navarro et al 2009 seidu et al 2008 and the present study to reach who standards who 2006b or class b sludge in south africa department water and agriculture of south africa 2006 1 egg g 1 and based on decay of 0 0095 log10 viable eggs day 1 table 1 the raw faecal sludge would need to be dried for 190 days field data points with known sludge age n 12 were used to estimate a decay rate the result 0 0093 day 1 with r2 0 36 was compatible with the log decay rate used in the tm 0 0095 day 1 a curve fit on predicted y versus measured log values x was also produced y 0 38x 0 80 r2 0 37 concentration of ascaris eggs in soil fertilised with sludge on the farms sampled had a mean of 9 5 viable eggs g 1 for samples obtained from the same farm sludge manure and npk fertilised fields had a mean concentration of 3 9 2 9 and 1 2 eggs g 1 respectively and differences were not significant p 0 47 the detection of ascaris eggs in soils that were not fertilised with sewage sludge may be explained by residual eggs from previous sludge applications or other potential sources of pathogens e g irrigation free ranging pigs the bacterial sampling also indicated sources other than sludge application table 2 however for bacterial contamination there are more likely sources among wild and domestic fauna even based on few data the difference in soil concentration indicates that the last sludge application could contribute up to 70 of the ascaris egg concentration in soil however when considering the overall true risk to farmers and consumers the background levels need to be included in most cases 19 22 e coli was not detected 100 cfu g 1 in soil fertilised with faecal sludge but was found in soil fertilised with manure or npk a study on farmer exposure in ghana antwi agyei et al 2016 reported an e coli concentration in soil of 2 3 log10 cfu g 1 which is similar to that found in this study 4 1 2 crops escherichia coli was detected on leafy vegetables in an average concentration of 1 6 log10 cfu g 1 which is similar to that reported for leafy vegetables in ghana 102 faecal coliform bacteria g 1 amoah et al 2007a it also agrees with the estimated survival time of coliforms on crops of 15 30 days who 2006b p 46 e coli was detectable on vegetables despite not being present in the soils where the vegetables were grown indicating other potential sources of contamination as the survival in soil is expected to be higher than on vegetables oliveira et al 2012 ascaris concentration on vegetables 11 1 9 viable eggs g 1 on leafy vegetables and 0 30 0 18 viable eggs g 1 cabbage was of the same magnitude as reported previously in a similar context 2 7 eggs g 1 spring onions and 0 4 eggs g 1 cabbage amoah et al 2006 the concentration on leafy vegetables was very close to that in the dried sludge table 2 this would represent rather high soil contamination despite harvesting being performed in very controlled ways to avoid soil contamination which may not be the case during large scale routine harvest since concentrations on cabbage are counts per unit weight considering only the outer leaves or the whole cabbage as done in this study would change estimates significantly 4 1 3 sampling strategy unlike e coli enterococcus spp was present in concentrations above the detection limit in all matrices analysed this may indicate slower decay and or other sources of contamination and suggests that enterococcus spp may be a better indicator of soil and crop contamination by persistent pathogens however enterococcus spp may also be of environmental origin so distinguishing enterococcus spp of faecal origin e faecalis and e faecium is required for accurate detection of faecal contamination bartz et al 2017 e coli may serve as a model for gram negative bacterial pathogens e g salmonella and shigella 4 2 risk characterisation in all scenarios the burden of disease expressed as years of life lost per 10 000 people table 5 was at least two orders of magnitude higher than the who tolerable additional disease burden of dalys lost 0 01 per 10 000 or 10 6 pppy table 4 and 5 the burden of disease was below the who value only for ehec when consuming cabbage based on field data and for both crops in the tm the latter due to assumed decay in the environment a target of 1 of local prevalence 4 5 for ascaris 25 for e coli risk to farmers as previously proposed mara 2011 mara and sleigh 2010 may be a more meaningful level for acceptable risk figs 5 and 6 show the risk of illness across the faecal sludge treatment reuse chain the contrasting risk estimates from the fm and tm depend on the different concentrations of pathogens measured versus assumed at each step of the treatment reuse chain fig 3 these differences are caused by considering in the tm only the last sludge application not including possible additional sources of pathogens and or residual eggs from previous fertilisation occurring in the field the tm also suffers from uncertainties in the application rate of sludge and migration rate from soil to crop fitting the tm to field data was tested where possible section 4 2 4 4 2 1 worker scenario dividing the scenario into daily duties showed that risk varied significantly depending on work tasks at the treatment plant unsurprisingly working with raw faecal sludge posed the highest risk and should be given priority in mitigation efforts evaluating the risk over time showed that while the yearly risk of illness remained almost 100 for both pathogens studied mitigation effects were detectable in a shorter time frame and more prominent for ascaris table 3 in uganda the prevalence of ascaris in workers managing drainage channels at another wwtp bugolobi is reported to be 2 3 and that in workers managing faecal sludge 0 fuhrimann et al 2016a overall prevalence of ascaris in uganda is estimated to be 4 5 karagiannis voules et al 2015 the qmra for 30 and 90 days in the present study estimated a risk of infection of 40 and 85 respectively considering that workers at lubigi wwfstp are dewormed every 90 days this could be considered the highest risk of infection the results support the deworming interval table 4 even considering the shorter time frame the estimated risk of illness was over 10 fold higher than reported for bugolobi wwtp it was not stated whether the bugolobi workers received deworming similar to workers at the lubigi plant fuhrimann et al 2016a in a survey on faecal sludge workers the self reported prevalence of diarrhoea over a 14 day recall period was 32 8 fuhrimann et al 2016b while a review by thorn and karekes 2001 reported prevalence of gastrointestinal problems in wwtp workers of 8 germany in 1954 and 13 sweden in 1978 using a time frame of two weeks which would cover the duration of illness in 99 of cases for ehec table 1 a risk of illness of 88 for the base scenario and 61 for the mitigated scenario was estimated from the models i e much higher than the self reported value for both pathogens the higher probability of illness calculated via qmra compared with prevalence reported by others could be caused by overestimation of involuntary ingestion host characteristics such as age and immunity could also play a role walker et al 2013 p 165 holland 2009 and may not be accounted for in the dose response curve in the studies cited use of protection measures was not mentioned but could explain the lower prevalence of infection 4 2 2 farmer scenario in a study by fuhrimann et al 2016a 25 of farmers self reported cases of diarrhoea over a period of two weeks in comparison the qmra over the same period predicted a probability of illness from ehec of 4 fm and below 0 01 tm the lower estimate fm may be partly explained by ehec being only one of many possible causes of diarrhoea and partly by underestimation of involuntary ingestion for farmers that the general concentration of e coli was analysed and assumed to represent a fraction of ehec is a matter of uncertainty for both models fm and tm for ascaris risk estimates diverged significantly between the tm and fm due to the different egg concentration in soil used in the two models 9 5 viable eggs g 1 fm and 0 24 viable eggs g 1 tm several scenarios were explored in order to reconcile the two models using the considered parameters within a reasonable range did not lead to a convincing result the difference between the two models could be caused by uncertainties connected to the parameters used in the tm decay dynamics in sludge and soil sludge application rate analytical recovery time passed between fertilisation but also by assuming only one source of pathogens the existence of other sources was indicated by the concentration of e coli and enterococcus found in npk fertilised fields but also by the limited difference between concentrations found in dried sludge 11 viable eggs g 1 and soil mean of 9 5 viable eggs g 1 across all fields despite these considerations given the limited amount of sampled farms further conclusions cannot be drawn additional studies perhaps in the form of controlled experiments are required to better understand the application and fate of ascaris in farm soil the yearly risk odds ratio or of 2 8 was higher than the value of 1 7 reported by tran thi et al 2017 but lower than the 3 5 5 4 reported in other studies amoah et al 2016 blumenthal and peasey 2002 pham duc et al 2013 4 2 3 consumer scenario for ehec the fm and tm produced contradictory yearly risk estimates e g risk was negligible in tm due to the fast decay assumed bartz et al 2017 and 100 in fm due to the detection of e coli on vegetables mean 2 6 log10 cfu g 1 these differences could be reconciled considering that water used for irrigation can also be a source of pollution amoah et al 2007a and that contamination may occur between farm and market 80 of vegetables sampled at a market in ghana were contaminated with e coli 0 6 3 8 log10 g 1 antwi agyei et al 2015 the estimated 100 probability of illness from ehec in the fm was significantly higher than that estimated previously for côte d ivoire which has a yearly infection risk of 12 23 kouamé et al 2017 in conclusion for ehec the qmra model based on extrapolation from e coli field data and weekly consumption indicated an almost certain risk of illness on a yearly basis but the source of this pathogen is unlikely to be the sludge used on fields for ascaris the slower decay in soil would theoretically allow this pathogen to survive and be present on the crop at harvest the divergence between tm and fm in soil concentration estimates fig 3 also affected crop concentration and risk estimate the fm predicted a yearly probability of illness of 100 based on concentrations found on leafy vegetables and 26 based on concentrations found on cabbage the tm prediction was 66 for leafy vegetables and 19 for cabbages the results from both models indicated that leafy vegetables pose a several fold higher risk than cabbage this is linked to the higher ascaris egg concentration found on leafy vegetables 11 4 viable eggs g 1 compared with cabbage 0 30 viable eggs g 1 both models showed that the crop chosen for the qmra may also be very influential for the outcome leafy vegetables showed higher concentration and risks regarding cabbages it should also be considered that while the pathogen concentrations on external leaves may be similar the greater weight of the inner cabbage head results in much lower counts per unit weight 4 2 4 fitting field data despite the significant differences in outcome between the two models an effort was made to adjust parameters to fit the tm to field data for ascaris the calibrated model was considered over a time frame of one month while for ehec the time frame was two weeks these periods were chosen based on the assumed duration of illness table 1 for the workers scenario matching the national ascaris prevalence of 4 5 would require daily ingestion just lower than that calculated in the mitigated scenario for activities with raw sludge 20 mg and for dried sludge 10 mg for ehec a 33 risk would be matched by ingestion of 6 mg of raw sludge assuming the same concentration in dried sludge as in the base scenario for the farmers and consumers scenarios fitting the tm proved more difficult in particular fitting the concentration found in soil with reasonable sludge application rate was not possible ascaris decay rate in soil and residual eggs from previous fertilisation were areas of great uncertainty assuming ascaris levels found in npk fertilised fields as a background concentration field data fitted with a decay rate of 90 t90 at 234 days for the tm the background concentration was not included but a more conservative approach was taken on decay t90 between 120 500 days this decay should produce a residual load after several fertilisations of around 0 45 viable egg g 1 migration rate from soil to crop was estimated based on limited data points obtained from field data but it would be beneficial to do further research on the topic a model reflecting the full risks would probably require inclusion of additional sources of pathogens e g via irrigation and would benefit from a larger sample and closer monitoring to determine key parameters rapp rm cres the development of such a combined fertilisation irrigation model could be the objective of further studies 4 2 5 uncertainty in qmra for involuntary ingestion estimates were based on published literature and may be considered reasonable but it is not known how accurately they describe the specific context acquired immunity and differences in age or gender were not considered in the model unlike in other studies karavarsamis and hamilton 2010 the infection to illness rate was modelled using a single value 0 35 for ehec and pert 0 15 0 27 0 39 for ascaris in future qmra validation with health data from workers could reduce these uncertainties statistical methods used may also have a significant impact poma et al 2019 as may dose response parameters kundu et al 2014 qmra is mostly used for estimating single exposure events but it would be worth exploring its use for continuous exposure the data collected during interviews and site visits were not sufficient to accurately estimate fertiliser application rate rapp and pathogen migration from soil to crop rm the tm was not able to explain the majority of the ascaris concentration found in soil improvement work on the model should include other possible sources of pathogens apart from sludge and residual eggs from previous applications ascaris survival in soil was modelled using literature data but given the wide range of available decay rates further context specific studies would be beneficial running two models based on different inputs led to different risk estimates indicating the importance of contextualising qmra with local data in combination with published data 4 3 risk mitigation four types of mitigation measures were identified improved treatment extension of drying limitation in the use of sludge application control limitation for certain crops use of personal protection equipment mask face shields shoes gloves and behavioural change for workers along the faecal sludge treatment reuse chain dumba et al 2013 strunz et al 2014 fig 4 4 3 1 worker scenario reducing involuntary ingestion could be done at two points during work activities and during eating at the workplace protective equipment should be used especially at the inlet and sedimentation beds the estimated daily risk of illness would then drop from 24 to 17 ehec inlet and from 22 to 13 ehec sedimentation beds since a face mask is difficult to wear for hours in a warm climate a face shield may be better option it could also be cleaned and reused risks from eating could be reduced by revising hygiene practices and lunch location and banning food consumption near the beds however the impact of these measures is difficult to predict given the numerous uncertainties involved ascaris risk of illness during the 90 days between deworming could be decreased from 58 to 18 reduction in the risk from ehec may only be detected over a 14 day period reduction from 88 to 60 4 3 2 farmer scenario sensitivity analysis showed that sludge drying time range 70 200 days was the main factor in controlling ehec infection global sensitivity index 0 27 and ascaris gsi 0 34 a first mitigation approach would consist of extending the drying period of the sludge at the wwtp or at the farm after purchase another set of mitigation strategies could act at farmer behaviour level particularly during the days with intense work in contact with soil protective equipment to reduce involuntary ingestion by 90 would decrease ascaris infection based on field data from 62 to 22 but would have no major impact on ehec infection 22 to 21 previous studies have shown that shoes and improved personal hygiene may reduce the risk of illness strunz et al 2014 4 3 3 consumer scenario sensitivity analysis showed that several factors influenced the final risk estimates for consumers for ascaris controllable factors drying time t application rate rapp washing rw ingestion i were responsible for 92 of the results gsi a 0 321 t 0 29 i 0 05 rw 0 26 thus mitigation efforts should concentrate on extending drying time illness probability reduction from 58 to 30 promoting appropriate sludge application rates in agriculture and good produce washing practices by consumers restriction on crop type was not tested numerically but the high variation in pathogen concentrations reported for different crops suggests that it could have a significant impact on the final risk of illness these mitigations would be aligned with guidelines for south africa class b sludge with the following additional measures sludge not used in growing vegetables to be eaten raw crop that touches the ground should not be harvested within 14 months after last sludge application it is also recommended not to exceed an application rate of 10 ton per ha and year for ehec the mitigation focus should be on the final part of the treatment reuse chain from harvest to point of sale by avoiding additional pollution most likely coming from water conclusions the concentrations of faecal indicator organisms and pathogens detected in sludge soil and vegetables suggested that the latest sludge application plays an important role but is not the sole source of pathogens along the reuse chain qmra estimates based on field sampling and theoretical decay calculations differed indicating the importance of contextualising risk assessment qmra models based on field data showed that yearly risk of infection was high for all groups considered workers farmers consumers qmra based on a decay model showed high yearly risk for ascaris but not for ehec ehec from faecal sludge is unlikely to be present on harvested crops possible mitigation strategies for workers and farmers showed a reduction in monthly risk of 30 70 sludge drying time was found to be an important factor in

17042,groundwater resources are under increasing threats from contamination and overuse posing direct threats to human and environmental health the purpose of this study is to better understand drivers of and relationships between well and aquifer characteristics sampling frequencies and microbiological contamination indicators specifically e coli as a precursor for improving knowledge and tools to assess aquifer vulnerability and well contamination within ontario canada a dataset with 795 023 microbiological testing observations over an eight year period 2010 to 2017 from 253 136 unique wells across ontario was employed variables in this dataset include date and location of test test results e coli concentration well characteristics well depth location and hydrogeological characteristics bottom of well stratigraphy specific capacity association rule analysis univariate and bivariate analyses regression analyses and variable discretization techniques were utilized to identify relationships between e coli concentration and the other variables in the dataset these relationships can be used to identify drivers of contamination their relative importance and therefore potential public health risks associated with the use of private wells in ontario key findings are that i bedrock wells completed in sedimentary or igneous rock are more susceptible to contamination events ii while shallow wells pose a greater risk to consumers deep wells are also subject to contamination events and pose a potentially unanticipated risk to health of well users and iii well testing practices are influenced by results of previous tests further while there is a general correlation between months with the greatest testing frequencies and concentrations of e coli occurring in samples an offset in this timing is observed in recent years testing remains highest in july while peaks in adverse results occur up to three months later the realization of these trends prompts a need to further explore the bases for such occurrences graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords private drinking water groundwater e coli testing trends large dataset machine learning 1 introduction globally groundwater resources are in high demand for agricultural domestic and industrial purposes over 50 of the world s population uses groundwater as a source of drinking water while 35 rely solely on groundwater for all domestic use groundwater resources have become a casualty of these competing demands resulting in an estimated 20 of aquifers being over exploited un water 2015 over exploitation creates additional challenges beyond the loss of water supplies including saltwater intrusion loss of wetlands and springs and land subsidence poor aquifer waste and wastewater management pose additional threats to groundwater through contamination by chemicals radionuclides and microorganisms once contaminated remediation is particularly challenging due to large water volumes long residence times and physical inaccessibility of aquifers foster and chilton 2003 where groundwater is still available for use this ongoing over exploitation and contamination introduces a cause for urgency in managing groundwater supplies more effectively particularly for human health an estimated 22 of canadians rely on groundwater for their domestic water supply murphy et al 2017 rivera 2017 with 12 4 5 million relying on privately owned and maintained groundwater supplies murphy et al 2016 that are outside governmental regulation and oversight in the great lakes system groundwater is considered the sixth great lake fong et al 2007 however ongoing microbiological groundwater contamination within the great lakes system fong et al 2007 threatens public health the combination of heavy reliance on this sixth great lake as a drinking water source ever increasing contamination and lack of government imposed regulation for private systems present significant public health challenges historically approximately 189 of 288 reported canadian waterborne disease outbreaks occurred in privately owned wells or small drinking water systems schuster et al 2005 this leaves approximately 2 9 million canadians at risk due to reliance on these systems murphy et al 2016 challenges facing private and small systems include limited resources for maintenance management and protection rivera 2017 and lack of regulation microbiological groundwater contamination events occur periodically across space and time resulting in sporadic patterns of acute gastrointestinal illness agi caused by consumption of contaminated water these cases of agi are difficult to track even in high income countries not only due to their sporadic nature but also significant under reporting as individuals rarely seek medical attention murphy et al 2016 and difficulties in confirming the exposure pathway schuster et al 2005 as such the number of actual groundwater related cases of agi is generally assumed to be significantly higher than reported murphy et al 2016 to effectively mitigate these events and reduce risk it is crucial to determine how and when pathogens are entering and travelling through the groundwater system the four main factors impacting the fate and transport of microbiological contaminants in aquifers are weather patterns hydrogeologic conditions presence of a source of microbiological contamination and well conditions location construction and maintenance o dwyer et al 2018 escherichia coli e coli is used as a standard indicator for faecal contamination any contamination risk can be mitigated or exacerbated through human behaviours and practices including well maintenance water quality testing water treatment and water consumption patterns fig 1 di

well users are unaware of and unable to access information on beyond individual well sample results di pelino et al 2019 kreutzwiser et al 2010 as such a need exists to improve our understanding of groundwater susceptibility and human health risk models this study uses a data driven approach to modelling groundwater fate and transport these approaches have contributed to the understanding of contaminant transport in groundwater buckerfield et al 2020 knoll et al 2019 and reduce computational requirements when compared to process based models castalletti et al 2012 data driven approaches have been used successfully in modelling e coli behaviour in fractured rock environments yosri et al 2021 predicting groundwater nitrate concentrations knoll et al 2019 identifying solute transport pathways in fractured aquifers yosri et al 2021 and characterizing uncertainty in coastal plain watershed systems samadi et al 2018 the goal of this study is to better understand drivers of and relationships between climate seasonality well and aquifer characteristics geology well depth sampling behaviour frequency timing and e coli presence concentration this is undertaken through a novel application of supervised machine learning techniques namely gamlss to a large dataset capturing both hydrological and microbiological variables for private wells these variables are collectively assessed within explanatory models as a precursor for improving understanding of aquifer vulnerability to contamination and assessing well water quality this work builds on latchmore et al 2020 which individually assessed geology and testing frequency to inform testing recommendations for private well users within a health risk framework 2 methods 2 1 dataset the analyses in this paper have been undertaken using an ontario specific groundwater dataset that consists of 795 023 well sample observations for 253 136 unique private wells that have been tested 1 to 446 times between 2010 and 2017 inclusive the dataset was created through the amalgamation of ontario s well water information system wwis and well water testing database wwtd more information on these databases can be found in latchmore et al 2020 parameters in the dataset are described in table 1 along with additional relevant dataset information and generated sub classifications for selected variables established according to criteria in the literature for the purpose of these analyses the specific classification methods are presented in s1 1 these sub classifications are used in lieu of or alongside discrete values in some analyses to fit regulatory definitions or account for uncertainty 2 2 data processing while the original dataset was assessed for quality as described by latchmore et al 2020 additional cleaning data conversion and sub classification table 1 were required to enable the assessment of factors driving the presence of e coli in private wells in ontario as described in s1 1 only observations associated with wells that were in use and classified as domestic or multiple use including domestic in the dataset were included in these analyses to better understand potential relationships selected continuous variables were classified into data bins to account for uncertainty in the data e g specific capacity e coli concentration or to align variables with well regulations standards and recommendations e g well depth testing frequency in the instance of well depth well regulations and data distribution were considered to ensure categorical bins were evenly distributed latitude and longitude are utilized as gradients over space rather than point locations as such they have been disaggregated into half degree bins 2 3 statistical analyses probability of e coli contamination in ontario private wells was investigated with respect to seasonality geological formation and well depth using numerous data exploration and visualization techniques the specific capacity was calculated based on pump test data in the dataset see s1 1 to assess changes over time trends were explored based on intra and inter annual patterns at different temporal resolutions these resolutions include monthly annual and the entire study period note that 0 06 of wells account for approximately 20 of e coli test results because of the large number of samples taken from these wells during the study period given that each e coli sample represents a data point in space and time the fact that they originate from a small number of wells helps to differentiate the impact of variable factors e g seasonality from fixed factors e g geology well characteristics further the distribution of fixed variables i e well depth bottom of well stratigraphy and specific capacity were compared between a dataset containing all e coli samples and one containing observations from individual wells represented by the highest e coli sample result the distributions remained similar indicating that highly sampled wells did not over weight the models before exploring more complex relationships using machine learning methods univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted on all independent variables univariate analyses were conducted to explore the data distribution of each individual variable bivariate analyses were conducted to identify empirical relationships between individual variable pairs specifically the probability of contamination given well depth and the probability of contamination given bottom stratigraphy were calculated see s1 1 these were followed by machine learning techniques i e association rule and regression analyses regression analyses were chosen over other non regression supervised machine learning techniques that require greater computational intensities i e random forests or that cannot be interpreted sufficiently to ensure adherence to physical processes i e artificial neural networks the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss regression model was chosen due to the highly skewed distributions zero inflated of some variables gamlss is able to deal with zero inflated variables through use of general distribution families i e highly skewed with the addition of zero inflated and zero adjusted families stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 the large number of observations with a zero e coli count 87 prohibits the use of linear models lm generalized linear models glm or general additive models gam stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 association rule analysis was chosen as a supplementary technique to further explore select variables due to its ability to discover interesting relationships and strong rules between variables in large datasets while being considered a fast mining algorithm hahsler et al 2005 2 3 1 regression analyses a series of regression analyses r package gamlss rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 were conducted to develop explanatory models for e coli concentration based on seasonality hydrogeology well characteristics and human behaviour table s2 4 a collinearity matrix was developed utilizing phi and pearson s coefficient and correlated variables as well as obvious confounders were removed from the set of model input variables the corresponding models use a distributional regression approach where all parameters of the conditional distribution of the response variable are modelled using explanatory variables rigby et al 2019 independent variables table s2 4 were selected to develop a series of models to explain e coli concentrations each exploring different elements of the risk pathway fig 1 seasonal driver 1 in fig 1 hydrogeological driver 2 in fig 1 well characteristics driver 3 in fig 1 and testing practices driver 4 in fig 1 this method of separating models combines the power of machine learning with subject matter expertise to understand the interactions and impacts of variables representing a specific driver of e coli contamination along the risk pathway once developed explanatory models for drivers 1 3 informed development of an informed model based on all relevant variables in the dataset based on subject matter expertise various combinations of independent variables were included in models to assess their ability to explain the dependent variable e coli concentrations or testing frequencies in some cases continuous categorical and binary forms of the same independent variable were assessed for performance against evaluation criteria e g model option 1 uses binary bottom stratigraphy and model option 2 uses categorical bottom stratigraphy all models were evaluated against each other employing 10 fold cross validation using the appropriate mixed model fitting families as defined by rigby et al 2019 fitting families were chosen to incorporate discrete categorical and continuous variables families chosen are as follows zero adjusted logarithmic distribution zalg and zero adjusted inverse gaussian distribution zaig rigby et al 2019 the best model was identified as the one with the lowest cross validated global deviance rigby et al 2019 rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 it is important to note that this enables a comparison between models but does not reflect model accuracy to consider model accuracy residual analyses were conducted on the best models once the best model was determined models were trained i e learning to fit the parameters of the independent variables using a randomly selected dataset containing 80 of the data and subsequently tested i e assessment of trained model performance on the remaining 20 of the data joshi 2020 as a means to fit the model this was conducted over 10 iterations with 10 unique data splits within each model with the regression coefficients averaged across iterations to address parameter uncertainty determine mean and variance in the coefficients for the final explanatory model two tailed hypothesis tests were used to assess the statistical significance of model variables note that statistical significance of variables in these models do not render the model predictive rather significance refers to the importance of the variable in explaining e coli presence or concentration in a well while the magnitude of the coefficient indicates relative impact ultimately the goal of these models is to explain casual relationships not predict the probability of an event occurring sainani 2014 finally to assess variable importance each independent variable was removed one by one and cross validated global deviance values were calculated and compared to assess the impact the most important variable to the model is defined as the variable that results in the greatest increase in cross validated global deviance when removed from the model 2 3 2 analyses of hydrogeological settings and well characteristics assessment of the impacts of the bottom layer stratigraphy categorized by rock type and grain size on e coli concentration cfu 100ml was undertaken utilizing association rule mining analysis using the apriori algorithm r package arules hahsler et al 2005 which identifies statistically interesting relationships in large datasets the interestingness of a rule is based on four key measurements confidence which is the estimate of the conditional probability of an itemset y given another itemset x hahsler et al 2005 support which is the proportion of observations in the dataset which contain the itemset x hahsler et al 2005 lift which is the deviation of the support from the expected value given independence hahsler et al 2005 and standardized lift which is the lift relative to its upper and lower bounds mcnicholas et al 2008 standardized lift was used as the ranking method in this study as it calls upon support confidence and lift and as such presents a natural and unambiguous method of ranking association rules mcnicholas et al 2008 all analyses were conducted with a minimum level of support of 0 005 to increase the number of rules derived a minimum confidence level of 0 9 to ensure a sufficient level of confidence and to narrow down derived rules and two to six items to ensure that the relationships considered are complex but not overly so mcnicholas et al 2008 2 3 3 well sampling analyses frequency and timing of well testing were explored in conjunction with the index sample status for each well within the recorded dataset period to explore whether the test message returned drove well testing frequency subsequent test or no subsequent test all individual wells were further reclassified into four testing status categories first test no significant evidence of e coli first test no result first test may be unsafe to drink and first test unsafe to drink while this analysis could be undertaken on any two consecutive samples almost half of the unique wells in this dataset were only tested once over the eight year study period as such the initial test also represents the only previous test for a large proportion of wells with no subsequent test being an important behavioural decision all values for the following calculations were standardized and plotted based on total number of tests and number of tests within each testing frequency group see s1 2 decay curves were then created utilizing the nonlinear least squares nls method see s1 2 to estimate the parameters yo yf α of the decay equation watson 2020 utilizing this decay function the decay rate for each initial test status was determined and compared further analyses were undertaken to determine whether user testing events coincide with typical seasonal weather such as spring thaws and summer dry wet patterns as well as high frequencies of adverse results user testing was determined by summing all observations in a given month of a given year adverse testing results for each month were standardized with respect to year see s1 2 3 results and discussion models for each driver are described and discussed in the following sections each model is described in table s2 5 and summarised in fig 2 3 1 seasonal drivers driver 1 in fig 1 e coli presence and concentration in the environment is driven in part by seasonal changes in temperature precipitation and land use thus an understanding of when samples are most likely to be adverse is necessary for enhanced testing awareness and recommendations seasonal drivers explored include season delineations and intra and inter annual relationships fig 2 table s2 5 figures s2 1 s2 6 no trends emerged from the bivariate analyses likely due to the complexity of e coli fate and transport processes the best gamlss explanatory model included latitude and longitude which were statistically significant and season delineation 1 i e winter commencing in january which was not statistically significant but holds explanatory value the most significant impact on e coli concentration in this model is latitude with each increasing half degree of latitude e coli concentrations decrease by 0 16 0 01 cfu 100ml p value 0 01 figure s2 1 table s2 5 latitude likely accounts for variations in the onset of freeze and thaw across ontario and therefore can be considered a proxy indicator for seasonal lag this is reflected in the 1975 2005 average first and last date for frost in different climate zones in ontario in a more southern zone average first and last frosts occur on october 8th and may 3rd respectively compared to september 16th and june 3rd in a more northern location omafra 2020 the more nuanced variations accounted for through latitude in particular may explain the lack of consistency in seasonal delineations within the literature atherholt et al 2017 rocha et al 2015 as well as the lack of statistical significance for the season delineations in this model table s2 5 longitude has a weaker relationship with e coli concentration but is a proxy for climate variations in tandem with latitude in ontario this is due to the presence of large bodies of water the great lakes which modify local temperature and precipitation patterns particularly in winter however it is recognised that climate also drives land use and land cover and that other variables such as population density vary spatially so a compound proxy cannot be ruled out seasonal delineations were subject to further refinement using individual months the best explanatory model that emerged included all months except april along with latitude and longitude this model indicates that samples collected in march explain the greatest increase in e coli concentrations while samples collected in december explain the greatest decrease in e coli concentrations july emerges with some of the highest numbers of adverse e coli sample results 18 2 n 4 699 fig 4 although these results do not represent the largest increase in e coli concentrations fig 2 table s2 5 the agricultural season begins in april may in ontario typically peaking between june and august affecting manure spreading bach et al 2002 ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks 2020a and livestock grazing patterns invik 2015 introducing more e coli into the environment conboy and goss 2000 further increased ambient temperatures lead to a more sustained e coli growth rate porter et al 2019 coupled with increased faecal excretion rates in cattle invik 2015 increased use of summer homes increases local septic tank usage and may also increase private well water quality testing di pelino et al 2019 additionally groundwater systems are more vulnerable to microbiological contamination in the summer months when extended hot dry periods harden the ground and lead to cracks which act as enhanced pathogen transport pathways that are activated during sporadic heavy rainfall events health canada 2020 high user testing in july 12 2 n 96 001 coupled with increased e coli loads and hydrological drivers likely contribute to the high numbers of adverse sample results in july health canada 2020 while the largest most significant monthly increase in e coli concentration occurs in march 0 25 0 05 cfu 100ml p value 0 03 march has one of the lowest numbers of user tests 6 4 n 50 858 and as a result is associated with a lower number of adverse e coli observations 4 38 n 1 131 fig 4 heavy rain and snowmelt typical of march and april jones et al 2015 not deemed explanatory by the model so not depicted have been associated with the flushing of e coli through the system schuster et al 2005 this increases risk of contamination health canada 2013 likely due to increased groundwater recharge possibly explaining the monthly increase in e coli concentrations in march and subsequent decrease in may p value 0 03 december emerges as a month with some of the lowest numbers of adverse e coli sample results 3 1 n 799 fig 4 and largest explanatory e coli concentration decrease 0 27 0 05 cfu 100ml p value 0 03 the findings for december may reflect combinations of changing processes and inputs including frozen soils and reduced rainfall thereby decreasing groundwater infiltration atherholt et al 2017 and reducing e coli availability bach et al 2002 similar to the seasons model findings latitude is significant in the monthly model p value 0 01 with a decrease in average e coli concentration of 0 16 0 01 cfu 100ml per half degree of latitude figure s2 3 s2 4 table s2 5 again while most likely driven by climate patterns a compound proxy cannot be ruled out an inter annual assessment of e coli concentration was conducted to look for trends year over year the average e coli concentration generally decreases from year to year between 2011 and 2017 with the exception of 2010 which was not identified as explanatory in the model fig 2 all years in the model except 2013 2014 and 2015 are statistically significant and all years are statistically significantly different from one another p value 0 01 except for 2011 to 2012 figure s2 5 s2 6 the peak average e coli concentrations in 2011 and 2012 are likely due to frequent flooding events causing mobilization of e coli latchmore et al 2020 ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks 2013 the years 2016 and 2017 represent a significant drop in average e coli concentrations over previous years p value 0 01 likely due to droughts in 2016 which reduced e coli transport latchmore et al 2020 similar to the seasonal and monthly models latitude and longitude are significant variables in the annual model with more northern latitudes associated with lower average e coli concentrations figure s2 5 3 2 hydrogeological drivers driver 2 in fig 1 one of the primary drivers of pathogen transport into a well is the local hydrogeology while the entire stratigraphic column plays a role in pathogen fate and transport this analysis focuses on the interface between the aquifer and the well production zone for a further exploration of the effects of overburden depth and specific bedrock types limestone shale sandstone and granite on e coli detection rates see latchmore et al 2020 the hydrogeological drivers explored here include bottom stratigraphy and specific well capacity among the variable groups discussed in the methods binary bottom stratigraphy i e consolidated or unconsolidated outperformed a categorical bottom stratigraphy averaging an improved cross validated global deviance from the dataset initial classifications for each well were defined as consolidated bedrock 63 3 n 499 647 or unconsolidated 36 7 n 289 426 of the wells completed in bedrock i e consolidated the lowest strata consisted of metamorphic 0 8 n 3 814 sedimentary 69 6 n 347 958 igneous 28 0 n 139 921 metamorphic and sedimentary 0 2 n 1 086 metamorphic and igneous 0 3 n 1 712 sedimentary and igneous 1 0 n 4 774 or all three rock types 0 1 n 382 the explanatory hydrogeological based model summary demonstrates that an unconsolidated bottom stratigraphy increases average e coli concentrations by 0 14 0 02 cfu 100ml p value 0 01 while consolidated did not provide explanatory power despite being considered a driver in the literature atherholt et al 2017 latchmore et al 2020 to explore further bivariate analyses were used to compare the likelihood of contamination in wells completed in consolidated bedrock and unconsolidated units it was found that those completed in unconsolidated units 29 4 n 7 589 are significantly less likely to encounter contamination than those in consolidated units 70 6 n 18 232 table s2 6 an association rules analysis further examined the impact of bedrock type on e coli concentrations according to the association rules wells completed in metamorphic bedrock had a lower probability of encountering higher e coli concentrations as compared to those completed in sedimentary bedrock when non detect nd observations were removed from the stratigraphy analyses to reduce skewing in e coli concentration wells completed in sedimentary and igneous materials had a higher probability of encountering higher e coli concentrations compared to those completed in metamorphic units table s2 7 these findings are supported by conboy and goss 2000 who found that wells completed in limestone or dolostone 76 of the sedimentary wells in the current dataset are considered at high risk for pathogen contamination the study further determined that the age of sedimentary rocks is important as older deposits likely contain more fractures and solution channels which act as transportation highways for pathogens conboy and goss 2000 and therefore e coli finally bedrock wells with minimal overburden are more likely to become contaminated due to the lack of soil available to filter pathogens before they reach fractures or channels conboy and goss 2000 latchmore et al 2020 surprisingly no association rules emerged linking e coli concentrations with either bottom stratigraphy permeability or specific capacity likely due to small numbers of observations in some subcategories 3 3 well characteristics driver 3 in fig 1 well characteristics impact the physical integrity of the well and thus influence e coli ingress di pelino et al 2019 the well characteristics explored here include well depth and year of well construction as with the hydrogeological drivers a selection between categorical and continuous variables for well depth was undertaken and it was determined that categorical well depth improved explanatory power it should be noted that a smaller number of categories was originally used to align with provincial regulations shallow moderate and deep ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks 2019 however this is a skewed distribution that resulted in findings that were in contradiction to conventional understanding and could not be explained using process based logic this is underscoring the fact that machine learning must be used in combination with disciplinary expertise to ensure relevant models reichstein et al 2019 well depth categories up to moderate3 were found to increase average e coli concentrations by 0 14 0 03 0 20 0 04 cfu 100ml p value 0 01 figure s2 7 s2 8 typically well users assume that deep wells are protected from contamination in comparison to moderate and shallow depth wells kreutzwiser et al 2010 however the fact that deep wells were not found to be explanatory of e coli concentration serves as a reminder that greater depths are not protective against contamination a supplementary bivariate analysis underscores this finding shallow wells were significantly different p value 0 05 from deep wells at all e coli concentrations with shallow wells being more likely to return adverse samples p value 0 0027 table s2 8 as such increased depth is not a reason to assume sufficient protection of drinking water quality given a risk of complacency regarding the microbiological safety of deep wells these findings could represent a public health threat to the 15 of well users who rely on deep wells in this dataset 3 4 informed physical model the findings from the seasonal hydrogeological and well characteristic models were used to create an informed physical model fig 2 figure s2 9 s2 10 based on model outputs table s2 5 and subject matter expertise the most explanatory variables were combined into a single model to explore relative importance of driver variables the final model consisted of binary bottom stratigraphy continuous specific capacity categorized well depth month of test year of test longitude and latitude general trends in the informed physical model aligned with those of the individual models the model is most sensitive to specific capacity followed by bottom of well stratigraphy year latitude well depth month and finally longitude this is a particularly interesting finding as the specific capacity of a well is not typically considered to be a driver of contamination risk more work needs to be done to determine whether specific capacity is a driver of contamination or if the model is selecting specific capacity as a proxy for other factors e g high permeability related to the presence of fractures these results demonstrate that machine learning techniques employed in combination with disciplinary expertise are useful for developing data driven explanatory models of the relationship between e coli concentrations in private wells and the drivers of this contamination indeed relative sensitivity to specific capacity makes sense but also highlights a variable that is not normally considered in this context and thus requires further process based analysis 3 5 testing practices driver 4 in fig 1 water quality testing is critical because it is the only way to characterize well water quality which provides important information for both well stewardship practices and human health protection a regression analysis of testing patterns revealed that individual wells were tested on average 2 70 0 004 times over the 8 year study period table s2 5 critically this dataset does not represent all private drinking water wells in ontario many wells were excluded due to incomplete information the inability to match a water test record to a well record or never having had a sample submitted to a provincial laboratory for testing as such given estimates of the number of wells in ontario ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks 2020b there may be approximately 345 000 additional wells not captured by this dataset that by definition would be classified as sampled fewer than 16 times according to the current dataset 98 n 245 708 of individual wells were tested less than the two times per year threshold 16 tests between 2010 and 2017 with 48 n 119 670 only testing once over the eight year period this limited testing may be attributable to complacency e g history of non adverse sample results or no concerning colour or odour no experience of adverse health effects or inconvenience e g limited hours at sample drop off locations invik 2015 using regression analyses user testing frequency was found to be impacted by the sample result message received excluding may be unsafe as it was not deemed important by the explanatory model so not depicted month of user test and year of user test fig 2 figure s2 11 s2 12 the return of an unsafe to drink message while not statistically significant slightly increased the number of samples taken by 0 02 0 008 over the study period likely due to the health concern that this result represents to the user table s2 5 a status that is returned as no result i e processing issues chemical testing requested appearance or order unacceptable interfering substances unauthorized submitter or no significant evidence was found to on average decrease the number of tests submitted 0 13 0 006 and 0 05 0 004 respectively likely due to the non alarming nature of the message table s2 5 to explore user testing practices further the message received for the first test was assessed as an indicator of subsequent testing it was found that two fitted decay equations were required to best characterize the data one for 15 or fewer tests and one for 16 or more tests as the decay rates are different for 15 or fewer tests if the first test message was no significant evidence 73 n 183 608 of initial samples the well user was less likely to continue testing decay rate 0 96 as compared to when initial samples were no result 6 n 15 816 decay rate 0 42 p value 0 0001 or may be unsafe 13 n 31 656 decay rate 0 40 p value 0 0001 or unsafe to drink 8 n 20 341 decay rate 0 40 p value 0 0001 fig 3 qayyum et al 2020 found that a well that received an initial negative index test not containing e coli or total coliforms retested 64 of the time when compared to a 74 retesting rate when the initial index test is positive containing e coli or total coliforms this reflects similar trends to those found in this work decay rates for retesting were highest i e less retesting when the index test was no significant evidence qayyum et al 2020 additionally all curves except may be unsafe and unsafe to drink are statistically significantly different from one another the use of the word unsafe is likely a flag for concern amongst well users well users testing 16 or more times over the 8 year study period are likely to be routine well testers while all of these decay curves are statistically significantly different from one another decay rates fall within a smaller range than those who test 15 or fewer times no significant evidence decay rate 0 11845 p value 0 0001 no result decay rate 0 16080 p value 0 0001 may be unsafe decay rate 0 15107 p value 0 0001 unsafe to drink decay rate 0 12197 p value 0 0001 table s2 9 routine testing indicates greater awareness of appropriate well stewardship practices lavallee et al 2020 the majority of samples were submitted for testing in july fig 4 representing the second highest increase in user testing frequency month over month it is postulated that this may represent seasonal testers further july is more conducive weather for driving as well as the start of summer holiday season in ontario when people may have more time or are using seasonal residences and associated wells interestingly the month with the largest impact on user testing frequency is january 0 26 0 01 times this may be because anyone testing in january is probably more consistent in their testing regime as january does not represent a month that is communicated as a critical testing period and thus has the fewest user tests fig 4 while in some years 2010 2011 2013 testing frequency coincided with peak adverse sample occurrences i e july this was not the case in 2012 and 2014 2017 when peak adverse sample occurrences shifted to as late as september this offset between testing and peak e coli contamination events raises the question of timing of future peaks in adverse occurrence and whether well users have adequate contamination risk information for optimal well testing practices starting in 2014 there is a general trend of decreasing user testing frequency figure s2 11 with no obvious explanation lack of user testing compliance combined with a divergence between peak testing and e coli contamination periods in latter years and the decreasing trend in testing frequency fig 4 underscore the need to better understand well user behaviours provide additional resources and target educational campaigns more specifically enhanced methods are required to predict and communicate risk of potential contamination events to well users and there is a need for evidence based testing regime guidelines increased well user outreach will improve knowledge attitudes and practices with respect to well sampling and testing to move well user sampling practices closer to the temporal truth latchmore et al 2020 of e coli contamination events 4 study limitations the wwtd is subject to methodological limitations associated with e coli quantification however the uncertainties cannot be quantified with the available data further the wwis database is subject to data entry errors as borehole logs are hand recorded in the field and later transcribed into an online database some of which date back to the 1910 s this was addressed through the removal of outliers that were outside the range of realistic values i e specific capacities less than zero there is no indication that these outliers are systematic 5 conclusion to the authors knowledge supervised machine learning approaches such as gamlss and association rule analysis have not previously been used to assess e coli contamination risk in private wells the approaches in combination with a large private well dataset enabled the development of explanatory models of e coli concentration as a function of seasonal hydrogeologic and well characteristic drivers consensus with existing literature for many findings confirms the validity of this novel approach which also identified drivers that are not typically considered but are supported by a process based understanding of the system as such these findings also demonstrate the importance of coupling machine learning approaches with disciplinary expertise this opens up opportunities to develop better tools to understand drivers and predict contamination that can be used to evaluate and mitigate public health risk and inform better policy and stewardship practices the results provide valuable insight into drivers of e coli contamination their relative importance and therefore potential public health risks associated with the use of private wells in ontario specifically the following key findings were uncovered the best delineation for the seasonal variable identified winter as starting in january however the seasonal variable was not found to be as important as latitude to explain intra annual variations in e coli concentrations due to the spatial variability of climate patterns in ontario specifically latitude was found to better represent spatial variations in the onset of seasonal freeze and thaw events that drive e coli concentrations and therefore should replace seasonal lag factors the use of months as a variable demonstrates the ability to capture more granular changes in inter annual peak e coli concentrations the shift in peak e coli concentrations to later in the year is a finding that requires further investigation bedrock wells completed in sedimentary and igneous formations are more likely to have higher e coli concentrations when compared to those completed in metamorphic or unconsolidated formations previously igneous and metamorphic formations have not been differentiated in this manner e coli contamination is statistically significantly impacted by well depth generally wells up to a depth of approximately 60m are more likely to become contaminated with e coli while this is congruent with the literature the depth threshold warrants further investigation further deep wells do not emerge as reducing e coli contamination as such increased depth does not guarantee that a contamination event will not occur testing and stewardship are still required the informed physical model was most sensitive to specific capacity followed by bottom of well stratigraphy year latitude well depth month and longitude the specific capacity of a well is not typically associated with contamination risk and therefore warrants further investigation testing frequency was significantly impacted by initial test message received frequency increased with an unsafe to drink result and decreased with no significant evidence and no result messages this finding confirms the need for well users to be educated on the temporal changes of e coli contamination of groundwater wells the impacts of the physical environment and well characteristics on e coli concentrations in their well and the need for an informed regular testing regime to protect their health while in general there is a correlation between when users test their wells and when the greatest frequencies and concentrations of adverse results occur a decoupling can be observed in recent years where testing remains highest in july but peaks in adverse results occur up to three months later this finding has potential implications for the health of well users as they may not be capturing peak e coli contamination events in their wells this study demonstrates that a coupled systems approach that applies machine learning techniques in combination with a large multi dimensional dataset can support and advance our understanding of geo spatio temporal relationships and interconnections that impact e coli contamination in private wells recognition of these interconnections offers an innovative path forward for enhancing private well user awareness and stewardship the identification of explanatory variables their relative importance and effects on e coli concentration in combination with other data sets e g

characteristics bottom of well stratigraphy specific capacity association rule analysis univariate and bivariate analyses regression analyses and variable discretization techniques were utilized to identify relationships between e coli concentration and the other variables in the dataset these relationships can be used to identify drivers of contamination their relative importance and therefore potential public health risks associated with the use of private wells in ontario key findings are that i bedrock wells completed in sedimentary or igneous rock are more susceptible to contamination events ii while shallow wells pose a greater risk to consumers deep wells are also subject to contamination events and pose a potentially unanticipated risk to health of well users and iii well testing practices are influenced by results of previous tests further while there is a general correlation between months with the greatest testing frequencies and concentrations of e coli occurring in samples an offset in this timing is observed in recent years testing remains highest in july while peaks in adverse results occur up to three months later the realization of these trends prompts a need to further explore the bases for such occurrences graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords private drinking water groundwater e coli testing trends large dataset machine learning 1 introduction globally groundwater resources are in high demand for agricultural domestic and industrial purposes over 50 of the world s population uses groundwater as a source of drinking water while 35 rely solely on groundwater for all domestic use groundwater resources have become a casualty of these competing demands resulting in an estimated 20 of aquifers being over exploited un water 2015 over exploitation creates additional challenges beyond the loss of water supplies including saltwater intrusion loss of wetlands and springs and land subsidence poor aquifer waste and wastewater management pose additional threats to groundwater through contamination by chemicals radionuclides and microorganisms once contaminated remediation is particularly challenging due to large water volumes long residence times and physical inaccessibility of aquifers foster and chilton 2003 where groundwater is still available for use this ongoing over exploitation and contamination introduces a cause for urgency in managing groundwater supplies more effectively particularly for human health an estimated 22 of canadians rely on groundwater for their domestic water supply murphy et al 2017 rivera 2017 with 12 4 5 million relying on privately owned and maintained groundwater supplies murphy et al 2016 that are outside governmental regulation and oversight in the great lakes system groundwater is considered the sixth great lake fong et al 2007 however ongoing microbiological groundwater contamination within the great lakes system fong et al 2007 threatens public health the combination of heavy reliance on this sixth great lake as a drinking water source ever increasing contamination and lack of government imposed regulation for private systems present significant public health challenges historically approximately 189 of 288 reported canadian waterborne disease outbreaks occurred in privately owned wells or small drinking water systems schuster et al 2005 this leaves approximately 2 9 million canadians at risk due to reliance on these systems murphy et al 2016 challenges facing private and small systems include limited resources for maintenance management and protection rivera 2017 and lack of regulation microbiological groundwater contamination events occur periodically across space and time resulting in sporadic patterns of acute gastrointestinal illness agi caused by consumption of contaminated water these cases of agi are difficult to track even in high income countries not only due to their sporadic nature but also significant under reporting as individuals rarely seek medical attention murphy et al 2016 and difficulties in confirming the exposure pathway schuster et al 2005 as such the number of actual groundwater related cases of agi is generally assumed to be significantly higher than reported murphy et al 2016 to effectively mitigate these events and reduce risk it is crucial to determine how and when pathogens are entering and travelling through the groundwater system the four main factors impacting the fate and transport of microbiological contaminants in aquifers are weather patterns hydrogeologic conditions presence of a source of microbiological contamination and well conditions location construction and maintenance o dwyer et al 2018 escherichia coli e coli is used as a standard indicator for faecal contamination any contamination risk can be mitigated or exacerbated through human behaviours and practices including well maintenance water quality testing water treatment and water consumption patterns fig 1 di pelino et al 2019 the health risks associated with dependence on drinking water wells combined with the increasing potential for groundwater to become contaminated present a risk that most private well users are unaware of and unable to access information on beyond individual well sample results di pelino et al 2019 kreutzwiser et al 2010 as such a need exists to improve our understanding of groundwater susceptibility and human health risk models this study uses a data driven approach to modelling groundwater fate and transport these approaches have contributed to the understanding of contaminant transport in groundwater buckerfield et al 2020 knoll et al 2019 and reduce computational requirements when compared to process based models castalletti et al 2012 data driven approaches have been used successfully in modelling e coli behaviour in fractured rock environments yosri et al 2021 predicting groundwater nitrate concentrations knoll et al 2019 identifying solute transport pathways in fractured aquifers yosri et al 2021 and characterizing uncertainty in coastal plain watershed systems samadi et al 2018 the goal of this study is to better understand drivers of and relationships between climate seasonality well and aquifer characteristics geology well depth sampling behaviour frequency timing and e coli presence concentration this is undertaken through a novel application of supervised machine learning techniques namely gamlss to a large dataset capturing both hydrological and microbiological variables for private wells these variables are collectively assessed within explanatory models as a precursor for improving understanding of aquifer vulnerability to contamination and assessing well water quality this work builds on latchmore et al 2020 which individually assessed geology and testing frequency to inform testing recommendations for private well users within a health risk framework 2 methods 2 1 dataset the analyses in this paper have been undertaken using an ontario specific groundwater dataset that consists of 795 023 well sample observations for 253 136 unique private wells that have been tested 1 to 446 times between 2010 and 2017 inclusive the dataset was created through the amalgamation of ontario s well water information system wwis and well water testing database wwtd more information on these databases can be found in latchmore et al 2020 parameters in the dataset are described in table 1 along with additional relevant dataset information and generated sub classifications for selected variables established according to criteria in the literature for the purpose of these analyses the specific classification methods are presented in s1 1 these sub classifications are used in lieu of or alongside discrete values in some analyses to fit regulatory definitions or account for uncertainty 2 2 data processing while the original dataset was assessed for quality as described by latchmore et al 2020 additional cleaning data conversion and sub classification table 1 were required to enable the assessment of factors driving the presence of e coli in private wells in ontario as described in s1 1 only observations associated with wells that were in use and classified as domestic or multiple use including domestic in the dataset were included in these analyses to better understand potential relationships selected continuous variables were classified into data bins to account for uncertainty in the data e g specific capacity e coli concentration or to align variables with well regulations standards and recommendations e g well depth testing frequency in the instance of well depth well regulations and data distribution were considered to ensure categorical bins were evenly distributed latitude and longitude are utilized as gradients over space rather than point locations as such they have been disaggregated into half degree bins 2 3 statistical analyses probability of e coli contamination in ontario private wells was investigated with respect to seasonality geological formation and well depth using numerous data exploration and visualization techniques the specific capacity was calculated based on pump test data in the dataset see s1 1 to assess changes over time trends were explored based on intra and inter annual patterns at different temporal resolutions these resolutions include monthly annual and the entire study period note that 0 06 of wells account for approximately 20 of e coli test results because of the large number of samples taken from these wells during the study period given that each e coli sample represents a data point in space and time the fact that they originate from a small number of wells helps to differentiate the impact of variable factors e g seasonality from fixed factors e g geology well characteristics further the distribution of fixed variables i e well depth bottom of well stratigraphy and specific capacity were compared between a dataset containing all e coli samples and one containing observations from individual wells represented by the highest e coli sample result the distributions remained similar indicating that highly sampled wells did not over weight the models before exploring more complex relationships using machine learning methods univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted on all independent variables univariate analyses were conducted to explore the data distribution of each individual variable bivariate analyses were conducted to identify empirical relationships between individual variable pairs specifically the probability of contamination given well depth and the probability of contamination given bottom stratigraphy were calculated see s1 1 these were followed by machine learning techniques i e association rule and regression analyses regression analyses were chosen over other non regression supervised machine learning techniques that require greater computational intensities i e random forests or that cannot be interpreted sufficiently to ensure adherence to physical processes i e artificial neural networks the generalized additive model for location scale and shape gamlss regression model was chosen due to the highly skewed distributions zero inflated of some variables gamlss is able to deal with zero inflated variables through use of general distribution families i e highly skewed with the addition of zero inflated and zero adjusted families stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 the large number of observations with a zero e coli count 87 prohibits the use of linear models lm generalized linear models glm or general additive models gam stasinopoulos and rigby 2007 association rule analysis was chosen as a supplementary technique to further explore select variables due to its ability to discover interesting relationships and strong rules between variables in large datasets while being considered a fast mining algorithm hahsler et al 2005 2 3 1 regression analyses a series of regression analyses r package gamlss rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 were conducted to develop explanatory models for e coli concentration based on seasonality hydrogeology well characteristics and human behaviour table s2 4 a collinearity matrix was developed utilizing phi and pearson s coefficient and correlated variables as well as obvious confounders were removed from the set of model input variables the corresponding models use a distributional regression approach where all parameters of the conditional distribution of the response variable are modelled using explanatory variables rigby et al 2019 independent variables table s2 4 were selected to develop a series of models to explain e coli concentrations each exploring different elements of the risk pathway fig 1 seasonal driver 1 in fig 1 hydrogeological driver 2 in fig 1 well characteristics driver 3 in fig 1 and testing practices driver 4 in fig 1 this method of separating models combines the power of machine learning with subject matter expertise to understand the interactions and impacts of variables representing a specific driver of e coli contamination along the risk pathway once developed explanatory models for drivers 1 3 informed development of an informed model based on all relevant variables in the dataset based on subject matter expertise various combinations of independent variables were included in models to assess their ability to explain the dependent variable e coli concentrations or testing frequencies in some cases continuous categorical and binary forms of the same independent variable were assessed for performance against evaluation criteria e g model option 1 uses binary bottom stratigraphy and model option 2 uses categorical bottom stratigraphy all models were evaluated against each other employing 10 fold cross validation using the appropriate mixed model fitting families as defined by rigby et al 2019 fitting families were chosen to incorporate discrete categorical and continuous variables families chosen are as follows zero adjusted logarithmic distribution zalg and zero adjusted inverse gaussian distribution zaig rigby et al 2019 the best model was identified as the one with the lowest cross validated global deviance rigby et al 2019 rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 it is important to note that this enables a comparison between models but does not reflect model accuracy to consider model accuracy residual analyses were conducted on the best models once the best model was determined models were trained i e learning to fit the parameters of the independent variables using a randomly selected dataset containing 80 of the data and subsequently tested i e assessment of trained model performance on the remaining 20 of the data joshi 2020 as a means to fit the model this was conducted over 10 iterations with 10 unique data splits within each model with the regression coefficients averaged across iterations to address parameter uncertainty determine mean and variance in the coefficients for the final explanatory model two tailed hypothesis tests were used to assess the statistical significance of model variables note that statistical significance of variables in these models do not render the model predictive rather significance refers to the importance of the variable in explaining e coli presence or concentration in a well while the magnitude of the coefficient indicates relative impact ultimately the goal of these models is to explain casual relationships not predict the probability of an event occurring sainani 2014 finally to assess variable importance each independent variable was removed one by one and cross validated global deviance values were calculated and compared to assess the impact the most important variable to the model is defined as the variable that results in the greatest increase in cross validated global deviance when removed from the model 2 3 2 analyses of hydrogeological settings and well characteristics assessment of the impacts of the bottom layer stratigraphy categorized by rock type and grain size on e coli concentration cfu 100ml was undertaken utilizing association rule mining analysis using the apriori algorithm r package arules hahsler et al 2005 which identifies statistically interesting relationships in large datasets the interestingness of a rule is based on four key measurements confidence which is the estimate of the conditional probability of an itemset y given another itemset x hahsler et al 2005 support which is the proportion of observations in the dataset which contain the itemset x hahsler et al 2005 lift which is the deviation of the support from the expected value given independence hahsler et al 2005 and standardized lift which is the lift relative to its upper and lower bounds mcnicholas et al 2008 standardized lift was used as the ranking method in this study as it calls upon support confidence and lift and as such presents a natural and unambiguous method of ranking association rules mcnicholas et al 2008 all analyses were conducted with a minimum level of support of 0 005 to increase the number of rules derived a minimum confidence level of 0 9 to ensure a sufficient level of confidence and to narrow down derived rules and two to six items to ensure that the relationships considered are complex but not overly so mcnicholas et al 2008 2 3 3 well sampling analyses frequency and timing of well testing were explored in conjunction with the index sample status for each well within the recorded dataset period to explore whether the test message returned drove well testing frequency subsequent test or no subsequent test all individual wells were further reclassified into four testing status categories first test no significant evidence of e coli first test no result first test may be unsafe to drink and first test unsafe to drink while this analysis could be undertaken on any two consecutive samples almost half of the unique wells in this dataset were only tested once over the eight year study period as such the initial test also represents the only previous test for a large proportion of wells with no subsequent test being an important behavioural decision all values for the following calculations were standardized and plotted based on total number of tests and number of tests within each testing frequency group see s1 2 decay curves were then created utilizing the nonlinear least squares nls method see s1 2 to estimate the parameters yo yf α of the decay equation watson 2020 utilizing this decay function the decay rate for each initial test status was determined and compared further analyses were undertaken to determine whether user testing events coincide with typical seasonal weather such as spring thaws and summer dry wet patterns as well as high frequencies of adverse results user testing was determined by summing all observations in a given month of a given year adverse testing results for each month were standardized with respect to year see s1 2 3 results and discussion models for each driver are described and discussed in the following sections each model is described in table s2 5 and summarised in fig 2 3 1 seasonal drivers driver 1 in fig 1 e coli presence and concentration in the environment is driven in part by seasonal changes in temperature precipitation and land use thus an understanding of when samples are most likely to be adverse is necessary for enhanced testing awareness and recommendations seasonal drivers explored include season delineations and intra and inter annual relationships fig 2 table s2 5 figures s2 1 s2 6 no trends emerged from the bivariate analyses likely due to the complexity of e coli fate and transport processes the best gamlss explanatory model included latitude and longitude which were statistically significant and season delineation 1 i e winter commencing in january which was not statistically significant but holds explanatory value the most significant impact on e coli concentration in this model is latitude with each increasing half degree of latitude e coli concentrations decrease by 0 16 0 01 cfu 100ml p value 0 01 figure s2 1 table s2 5 latitude likely accounts for variations in the onset of freeze and thaw across ontario and therefore can be considered a proxy indicator for seasonal lag this is reflected in the 1975 2005 average first and last date for frost in different climate zones in ontario in a more southern zone average first and last frosts occur on october 8th and may 3rd respectively compared to september 16th and june 3rd in a more northern location omafra 2020 the more nuanced variations accounted for through latitude in particular may explain the lack of consistency in seasonal delineations within the literature atherholt et al 2017 rocha et al 2015 as well as the lack of statistical significance for the season delineations in this model table s2 5 longitude has a weaker relationship with e coli concentration but is a proxy for climate variations in tandem with latitude in ontario this is due to the presence of large bodies of water the great lakes which modify local temperature and precipitation patterns particularly in winter however it is recognised that climate also drives land use and land cover and that other variables such as population density vary spatially so a compound proxy cannot be ruled out seasonal delineations were subject to further refinement using individual months the best explanatory model that emerged included all months except april along with latitude and longitude this model indicates that samples collected in march explain the greatest increase in e coli concentrations while samples collected in december explain the greatest decrease in e coli concentrations july emerges with some of the highest numbers of adverse e coli sample results 18 2 n 4 699 fig 4 although these results do not represent the largest increase in e coli concentrations fig 2 table s2 5 the agricultural season begins in april may in ontario typically peaking between june and august affecting manure spreading bach et al 2002 ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks 2020a and livestock grazing patterns invik 2015 introducing more e coli into the environment conboy and goss 2000 further increased ambient temperatures lead to a more sustained e coli growth rate porter et al 2019 coupled with increased faecal excretion rates in cattle invik 2015 increased use of summer homes increases local septic tank usage and may also increase private well water quality testing di pelino et al 2019 additionally groundwater systems are more vulnerable to microbiological contamination in the summer months when extended hot dry periods harden the ground and lead to cracks which act as enhanced pathogen transport pathways that are activated during sporadic heavy rainfall events health canada 2020 high user testing in july 12 2 n 96 001 coupled with increased e coli loads and hydrological drivers likely contribute to the high numbers of adverse sample results in july health canada 2020 while the largest most significant monthly increase in e coli concentration occurs in march 0 25 0 05 cfu 100ml p value 0 03 march has one of the lowest numbers of user tests 6 4 n 50 858 and as a result is associated with a lower number of adverse e coli observations 4 38 n 1 131 fig 4 heavy rain and snowmelt typical of march and april jones et al 2015 not deemed explanatory by the model so not depicted have been associated with the flushing of e coli through the system schuster et al 2005 this increases risk of contamination health canada 2013 likely due to increased groundwater recharge possibly explaining the monthly increase in e coli concentrations in march and subsequent decrease in may p value 0 03 december emerges as a month with some of the lowest numbers of adverse e coli sample results 3 1 n 799 fig 4 and largest explanatory e coli concentration decrease 0 27 0 05 cfu 100ml p value 0 03 the findings for december may reflect combinations of changing processes and inputs including frozen soils and reduced rainfall thereby decreasing groundwater infiltration atherholt et al 2017 and reducing e coli availability bach et al 2002 similar to the seasons model findings latitude is significant in the monthly model p value 0 01 with a decrease in average e coli concentration of 0 16 0 01 cfu 100ml per half degree of latitude figure s2 3 s2 4 table s2 5 again while most likely driven by climate patterns a compound proxy cannot be ruled out an inter annual assessment of e coli concentration was conducted to look for trends year over year the average e coli concentration generally decreases from year to year between 2011 and 2017 with the exception of 2010 which was not identified as explanatory in the model fig 2 all years in the model except 2013 2014 and 2015 are statistically significant and all years are statistically significantly different from one another p value 0 01 except for 2011 to 2012 figure s2 5 s2 6 the peak average e coli concentrations in 2011 and 2012 are likely due to frequent flooding events causing mobilization of e coli latchmore et al 2020 ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks 2013 the years 2016 and 2017 represent a significant drop in average e coli concentrations over previous years p value 0 01 likely due to droughts in 2016 which reduced e coli transport latchmore et al 2020 similar to the seasonal and monthly models latitude and longitude are significant variables in the annual model with more northern latitudes associated with lower average e coli concentrations figure s2 5 3 2 hydrogeological drivers driver 2 in fig 1 one of the primary drivers of pathogen transport into a well is the local hydrogeology while the entire stratigraphic column plays a role in pathogen fate and transport this analysis focuses on the interface between the aquifer and the well production zone for a further exploration of the effects of overburden depth and specific bedrock types limestone shale sandstone and granite on e coli detection rates see latchmore et al 2020 the hydrogeological drivers explored here include bottom stratigraphy and specific well capacity among the variable groups discussed in the methods binary bottom stratigraphy i e consolidated or unconsolidated outperformed a categorical bottom stratigraphy averaging an improved cross validated global deviance from the dataset initial classifications for each well were defined as consolidated bedrock 63 3 n 499 647 or unconsolidated 36 7 n 289 426 of the wells completed in bedrock i e consolidated the lowest strata consisted of metamorphic 0 8 n 3 814 sedimentary 69 6 n 347 958 igneous 28 0 n 139 921 metamorphic and sedimentary 0 2 n 1 086 metamorphic and igneous 0 3 n 1 712 sedimentary and igneous 1 0 n 4 774 or all three rock types 0 1 n 382 the explanatory hydrogeological based model summary demonstrates that an unconsolidated bottom stratigraphy increases average e coli concentrations by 0 14 0 02 cfu 100ml p value 0 01 while consolidated did not provide explanatory power despite being considered a driver in the literature atherholt et al 2017 latchmore et al 2020 to explore further bivariate analyses were used to compare the likelihood of contamination in wells completed in consolidated bedrock and unconsolidated units it was found that those completed in unconsolidated units 29 4 n 7 589 are significantly less likely to encounter contamination than those in consolidated units 70 6 n 18 232 table s2 6 an association rules analysis further examined the impact of bedrock type on e coli concentrations according to the association rules wells completed in metamorphic bedrock had a lower probability of encountering higher e coli concentrations as compared to those completed in sedimentary bedrock when non detect nd observations were removed from the stratigraphy analyses to reduce skewing in e coli concentration wells completed in sedimentary and igneous materials had a higher probability of encountering higher e coli concentrations compared to those completed in metamorphic units table s2 7 these findings are supported by conboy and goss 2000 who found that wells completed in limestone or dolostone 76 of the sedimentary wells in the current dataset are considered at high risk for pathogen contamination the study further determined that the age of sedimentary rocks is important as older deposits likely contain more fractures and solution channels which act as transportation highways for pathogens conboy and goss 2000 and therefore e coli finally bedrock wells with minimal overburden are more likely to become contaminated due to the lack of soil available to filter pathogens before they reach fractures or channels conboy and goss 2000 latchmore et al 2020 surprisingly no association rules emerged linking e coli concentrations with either bottom stratigraphy permeability or specific capacity likely due to small numbers of observations in some subcategories 3 3 well characteristics driver 3 in fig 1 well characteristics impact the physical integrity of the well and thus influence e coli ingress di pelino et al 2019 the well characteristics explored here include well depth and year of well construction as with the hydrogeological drivers a selection between categorical and continuous variables for well depth was undertaken and it was determined that categorical well depth improved explanatory power it should be noted that a smaller number of categories was originally used to align with provincial regulations shallow moderate and deep ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks 2019 however this is a skewed distribution that resulted in findings that were in contradiction to conventional understanding and could not be explained using process based logic this is underscoring the fact that machine learning must be used in combination with disciplinary expertise to ensure relevant models reichstein et al 2019 well depth categories up to moderate3 were found to increase average e coli concentrations by 0 14 0 03 0 20 0 04 cfu 100ml p value 0 01 figure s2 7 s2 8 typically well users assume that deep wells are protected from contamination in comparison to moderate and shallow depth wells kreutzwiser et al 2010 however the fact that deep wells were not found to be explanatory of e coli concentration serves as a reminder that greater depths are not protective against contamination a supplementary bivariate analysis underscores this finding shallow wells were significantly different p value 0 05 from deep wells at all e coli concentrations with shallow wells being more likely to return adverse samples p value 0 0027 table s2 8 as such increased depth is not a reason to assume sufficient protection of drinking water quality given a risk of complacency regarding the microbiological safety of deep wells these findings could represent a public health threat to the 15 of well users who rely on deep wells in this dataset 3 4 informed physical model the findings from the seasonal hydrogeological and well characteristic models were used to create an informed physical model fig 2 figure s2 9 s2 10 based on model outputs table s2 5 and subject matter expertise the most explanatory variables were combined into a single model to explore relative importance of driver variables the final model consisted of binary bottom stratigraphy continuous specific capacity categorized well depth month of test year of test longitude and latitude general trends in the informed physical model aligned with those of the individual models the model is most sensitive to specific capacity followed by bottom of well stratigraphy year latitude well depth month and finally longitude this is a particularly interesting finding as the specific capacity of a well is not typically considered to be a driver of contamination risk more work needs to be done to determine whether specific capacity is a driver of contamination or if the model is selecting specific capacity as a proxy for other factors e g high permeability related to the presence of fractures these results demonstrate that machine learning techniques employed in combination with disciplinary expertise are useful for developing data driven explanatory models of the relationship between e coli concentrations in private wells and the drivers of this contamination indeed relative sensitivity to specific capacity makes sense but also highlights a variable that is not normally considered in this context and thus requires further process based analysis 3 5 testing practices driver 4 in fig 1 water quality testing is critical because it is the only way to characterize well water quality which provides important information for both well stewardship practices and human health protection a regression analysis of testing patterns revealed that individual wells were tested on average 2 70 0 004 times over the 8 year study period table s2 5 critically this dataset does not represent all private drinking water wells in ontario many wells were excluded due to incomplete information the inability to match a water test record to a well record or never having had a sample submitted to a provincial laboratory for testing as such given estimates of the number of wells in ontario ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks 2020b there may be approximately 345 000 additional wells not captured by this dataset that by definition would be classified as sampled fewer than 16 times according to the current dataset 98 n 245 708 of individual wells were tested less than the two times per year threshold 16 tests between 2010 and 2017 with 48 n 119 670 only testing once over the eight year period this limited testing may be attributable to complacency e g history of non adverse sample results or no concerning colour or odour no experience of adverse health effects or inconvenience e g limited hours at sample drop off locations invik 2015 using regression analyses user testing frequency was found to be impacted by the sample result message received excluding may be unsafe as it was not deemed important by the explanatory model so not depicted month of user test and year of user test fig 2 figure s2 11 s2 12 the return of an unsafe to drink message while not statistically significant slightly increased the number of samples taken by 0 02 0 008 over the study period likely due to the health concern that this result represents to the user table s2 5 a status that is returned as no result i e processing issues chemical testing requested appearance or order unacceptable interfering substances unauthorized submitter or no significant evidence was found to on average decrease the number of tests submitted 0 13 0 006 and 0 05 0 004 respectively likely due to the non alarming nature of the message table s2 5 to explore user testing practices further the message received for the first test was assessed as an indicator of subsequent testing it was found that two fitted decay equations were required to best characterize the data one for 15 or fewer tests and one for 16 or more tests as the decay rates are different for 15 or fewer tests if the first test message was no significant evidence 73 n 183 608 of initial samples the well user was less likely to continue testing decay rate 0 96 as compared to when initial samples were no result 6 n 15 816 decay rate 0 42 p value 0 0001 or may be unsafe 13 n 31 656 decay rate 0 40 p value 0 0001 or unsafe to drink 8 n 20 341 decay rate 0 40 p value 0 0001 fig 3 qayyum et al 2020 found that a well that received an initial negative index test not containing e coli or total coliforms retested 64 of the time when compared to a 74 retesting rate when the initial index test is positive containing e coli or total coliforms this reflects similar trends to those found in this work decay rates for retesting were highest i e less retesting when the index test was no significant evidence qayyum et al 2020 additionally all curves except may be unsafe and unsafe to drink are statistically significantly different from one another the use of the word unsafe is likely a flag for concern amongst well users well users testing 16 or more times over the 8 year study period are likely to be routine well testers while all of these decay curves are statistically significantly different from one another decay rates fall within a smaller range than those who test 15 or fewer times no significant evidence decay rate 0 11845 p value 0 0001 no result decay rate 0 16080 p value 0 0001 may be unsafe decay rate 0 15107 p value 0 0001 unsafe to drink decay rate 0 12197 p value 0 0001 table s2 9 routine testing indicates greater awareness of appropriate well stewardship practices lavallee et al 2020 the majority of samples were submitted for testing in july fig 4 representing the second highest increase in user testing frequency month over month it is postulated that this may represent seasonal testers further july is more conducive weather for driving as well as the start of summer holiday season in ontario when people may have more time or are using seasonal residences and associated wells interestingly the month with the largest impact on user testing frequency is january 0 26 0 01 times this may be because anyone testing in january is probably more consistent in their testing regime as january does not represent a month that is communicated as a critical testing period and thus has the fewest user tests fig 4 while in some years 2010 2011 2013 testing frequency coincided with peak adverse sample occurrences i e july this was not the case in 2012 and 2014 2017 when peak adverse sample occurrences shifted to as late as september this offset between testing and peak e coli contamination events raises the question of timing of future peaks in adverse occurrence and whether well users have adequate contamination risk information for optimal well testing practices starting in 2014 there is a general trend of decreasing user testing frequency figure s2 11 with no obvious explanation lack of user testing compliance combined with a divergence between peak testing and e coli contamination periods in latter years and the decreasing trend in testing frequency fig 4 underscore the need to better understand well user behaviours provide additional resources and target educational campaigns more specifically enhanced methods are required to predict and communicate risk of potential contamination events to well users and there is a need for evidence based testing regime guidelines increased well user outreach will improve knowledge attitudes and practices with respect to well sampling and testing to move well user sampling practices closer to the temporal truth latchmore et al 2020 of e coli contamination events 4 study limitations the wwtd is subject to methodological limitations associated with e coli quantification however the uncertainties cannot be quantified with the available data further the wwis database is subject to data entry errors as borehole logs are hand recorded in the field and later transcribed into an online database some of which date back to the 1910 s this was addressed through the removal of outliers that were outside the range of realistic values i e specific capacities less than zero there is no indication that these outliers are systematic 5 conclusion to the authors knowledge supervised machine learning approaches such as gamlss and association rule analysis have not previously been used to assess e coli contamination risk in private wells the approaches in combination with a large private well dataset enabled the development of explanatory models of e coli concentration as a function of seasonal hydrogeologic and well characteristic drivers consensus with existing literature for many findings confirms the validity of this novel approach which also identified drivers that are not typically considered but are supported by a process based understanding of the system as such these findings also demonstrate the importance of coupling machine learning approaches with disciplinary expertise this opens up opportunities to develop better tools to understand drivers and predict contamination that can be used to evaluate and mitigate public health risk and inform better policy and stewardship practices the results provide valuable insight into drivers of e coli contamination their relative importance and therefore potential public health risks associated with the use of private wells in ontario specifically the following key findings were uncovered the best delineation for the seasonal variable identified winter as starting in january however the seasonal variable was not found to be as important as latitude to explain intra annual variations in e coli concentrations due to the spatial variability of climate patterns in ontario specifically latitude was found to better represent spatial variations in the onset of seasonal freeze and thaw events that drive e coli concentrations and therefore should replace seasonal lag factors the use of months as a variable demonstrates the ability to capture more granular changes in inter annual peak e coli concentrations the shift in peak e coli concentrations to later in the year is a finding that requires further investigation bedrock wells completed in sedimentary and igneous formations are more likely to have higher e coli concentrations when compared to those completed in metamorphic or unconsolidated formations previously igneous and metamorphic formations have not been differentiated in this manner e coli contamination is statistically significantly impacted by well depth generally wells up to a depth of approximately 60m are more likely to become contaminated with e coli while this is congruent with the literature the depth threshold warrants further investigation further deep wells do not emerge as reducing e coli contamination as such increased depth does not guarantee that a contamination event will not occur testing and stewardship are still required the informed physical model was most sensitive to specific capacity followed by bottom of well stratigraphy year latitude well depth month and longitude the specific capacity of a well is not typically associated with contamination risk and therefore warrants further investigation testing frequency was significantly impacted by initial test message received frequency increased with an unsafe to drink result and decreased with no significant evidence and no result messages this finding confirms the need for well users to be educated on the temporal changes of e coli contamination of groundwater wells the impacts of the physical environment and well characteristics on e coli concentrations in their well and the need for an informed regular testing regime to protect their health while in general there is a correlation between when users test their wells and when the greatest frequencies and concentrations of adverse results occur a decoupling can be observed in recent years where testing remains highest in july but peaks in adverse results occur up to three months later this finding has potential implications for the health of well users as they may not be capturing peak e coli contamination events in their wells this study demonstrates that a coupled systems approach that applies machine learning techniques in combination with a large multi dimensional dataset can support and advance our understanding of geo spatio temporal relationships and interconnections that impact e coli contamination in private wells recognition of these interconnections offers an innovative path forward for enhancing private well user awareness and stewardship the identification of explanatory variables their relative importance and effects on e coli concentration in combination with other data sets e g

17043,to reveal the role of ferrate self decomposition and the fates of intermediate iron species fe v fe iv species during ferrate oxidation the reaction between ferrate and methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso at ph 7 0 was investigated as a model system in this study interestingly the apparent second order rate constants k app between ferrate and pmso was found to increase with ferrate dosage in the condition of excess ferrate in borate buffer this ferrate dosage effect was diminished greatly in the condition of excess pmso where ferrate self decomposition was lessened largely or counterbalanced by adding a strong complexing ligand e g pyrophosphate to sequester fe v oxidation demonstrating that the fe v species derived from ferrate self decomposition plays an important role in pmso oxidation a mechanistic kinetics model involving the ferrate self decomposition and pmso oxidation by fe vi fe v and fe iv species was then developed and validated the modeling results show that up to 99 of the pmso oxidation was contributed by the ferrate self decomposition resultant fe v species in borate buffer revealing that ferrate self decomposition is also a self activation process the direct fe vi oxidation of pmso was impervious to presence of phosphate or fe iii while the fe v oxidation pathway was strongly inhibited by phosphate complexation or enhanced with fe iii similar ferrate dosage effect and its counterbalance by pyrophosphate as well as the fe iii enhancement were also observed in ferrate oxidation of micropollutants like carbamazepine diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole implying the general role of fe v and promising fe iii enhancement during ferrate oxidation of micropollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate intermediate iron species oxidation micropollutants kinetics 1 introduction ferrate has been considered as a green and potent chemical with multiple functions in water treatment for many years sharma et al 2015 ma and liu 2002a ma and liu 2002b chen et al 2018a chen et al 2018b as a powerful oxidant ferrate is effective in abating micropollutants from water especially organic compounds with electron rich moieties like phenols olefins anilines and amines lee et al 2009 liu et al 2018 sun et al 2018 ferrate is also a promising disinfectant efficacious for inactivating bacteria and viruses meanwhile it has a satisfactory control of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps formation schink and waite 1980 hu et al 2012 fan et al 2018 cui et al 2020 gombos et al 2012 wang et al 2019a further the resultant iron iii oxide hydroxide particles from ferrate reduction show great capacity in removing arsenic selenite heavy metals and total organic compounds yang et al 2018a viktor et al 2020 liu et al 2017 yang et al 2018b the intrinsic drawback of ferrate might be its instability in aqueous solution which causes great challenge and difficulty in the ferrate preparation storage and transportation sharma et al 2015 the ferrate self decomposition is highly ph and dosage dependent which is accelerated at acidic condition and high dosage lee et al 2014 during the ferrate self decomposition fe vi is reduced to fe iii by water via the intermediacy of fe iv and fe v species of which reactivity was reported to be several orders of magnitude higher than that of the parent fe vi and might contribute to the micropollutants elimination during ferrate oxidation sharma 2011 sharma 2013 sharma et al 2001 however the fe v fe iv species are also highly unstable and short lived in aqueous solution resulting in low oxidant exposure rush and bielski 1989 melton and bielski 1990 therefore whether ferrate self decomposition is just a self degradation process consuming oxidation capacity or a self activation process transforming fe vi into the more reactive fe v fe iv species for oxidation has remained unclear it depends on whether the fe v fe iv species are taking part into the target compounds oxidation and to what extent they contribute to the overall ferrate oxidation exploring the reaction properties of the fe v fe iv species could help to understand their roles and fates during the ferrate oxidation process in a previous study we found that the oxidative reactivity of fe v species could be greatly reduced upon phosphate complexation which depressed the overall ferrate oxidation performance huang et al 2018 on one hand we concluded that the actual oxidation ability of ferrate was underestimated because of the prevalent use of phosphate buffer in lab experiments relevant to ferrate on the other hand based on the chemical characteristic that the fe v species oxidation could be sequestered upon phosphate or pyrophosphate ligand complexation we hypothesized that the reaction selectivity and relative contribution of fe v species might be investigated by comparing the ferrate oxidation performance in solution with or without the presence of phosphate ligand to accurately obtain the relative contribution of a specific species during a complex reaction involving multiple active species a normal way is to develop a chemistry kinetic model consisting of major elementary reactions and corresponding rate constants in this model approach the selection of target compound is crucial for studying the fates of fe v fe iv species during ferrate oxidation good candidate compounds are those whose reaction mechanisms are known as one or two electron transfer which indicate that fe v or fe iv species is primarily produced from fe vi reduction abts is a typical compound of one electron transfer mechanism and its initial oxidation product abts is easy to be monitored spectrophotometrically at wavelength of 415 nm however abts would be further oxidized to other unknown products in the excess of ferrate xue et al 2020 making the excess ferrate abts system too complicated it was reported that some sulfoxide compounds such as dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso could be oxidized by ferrate with a two electron transfer mechanism generating the corresponding sulfones as products which would not be further oxidized by excess ferrate pang et al 2011 shao et al 2019 besides both pmso and pmso2 methyl phenyl sulfone could be readily analyzed by liquid chromatography pang et al 2011 wang et al 2018 the enhanced ferrate oxidation of organic pollutants e g diclofenac zhao et al 2018a zhao et al 2018b and sulfamethoxazole shao et al 2019 with fe iii addition have been reported in unbuffered or borate buffered systems the catalytic effect of fe iii particles on ferrate self decomposition jiang et al 2015 and the concomitant accelerated formation of active intermediate iron species lee et al 2014 were proposed as the underlying mechanism however the discussion was rather general and no solid evidence or quantitative analysis is available by now in this study the ferrate pmso reaction was systematically investigated as a model system of two electron transfer mechanism to provide basic information on the fates of fe v fe iv species and the role of ferrate self decomposition during ferrate oxidation the oxidation kinetics of pmso by varying dosage of ferrate were comparatively investigated in the condition of excess ferrate or excess pmso in borate buffer or phosphate buffer at ph 7 0 a mechanistic kinetic model was then developed to quantitatively explain the oxidant dosage effect observed and gain further insights into the fe iii enhanced effect 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents potassium ferrate k2feo4 was prepared according to a wet chemical oxidation method described previously thompson et al 1951 liu et al 2016 having a purity as high as 88 in term of fe vi w w one of the main impurity in ferrate powder is fe iii oxyhydr oxides 10 which could be removed by filtration preparation of stock solutions of ferrate fecl3 and fe vi origin fe iii was described in si text 1 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts sulfamethoxazole smx carbamazepine cbz and diclofencac sodium dcf were purchased from sigma aldrich with purity 97 other reagents including sodium tetraborate decahydrate sodium hydrogen phosphate sodium dihydrogen phosphate sodium pyrophosphate ferric chloride hydrogen peroxide were all reagent pure and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd all aqueous solutions were prepared with ultrapure water produced by a milli q system millipore billerica ma except that the stock solutions of smx and cbz were prepared in an acetonitrile water mixture 10 90 authentic water sample songhua river at harbin heilongjiang province china has been filtered through glass fiber membrane 0 7 µm prior to use relevant parameters are shown in table s2 2 2 kinetic experiments kinetic studies of pmso oxidation by ferrate were investigated in different buffer conditions at ph 7 0 the batch experiments were conducted in glass flasks with rapid magnetic stirring 500 r min at room temperature 25 0 2 c maintained by a water bath an aliquot of pmso stock solution 10 mm was spiked into the 150 ml system for a target concentration of 10 or 104 µm various calculated volumes of ferrate stock solution for different ferrate dosages 20 30 50 µm were added to start the kinetic runs two sample aliquots were sampled simultaneously at proper time intervals one sample was immediately quenched with excess hydroxylamine 20 µl of 10 w w nh2oh hcl johnson and hornstein 2003 feng et al 2018 and filtered through a ptfe membrane 0 22 µm pore size before pmso and pmso2 concentration measurement with liquid chromatography si text 2 another sample was quenched with an abts solution to determine the residual ferrate concentrations lee et al 2014 the experimental procedures of the investigation of fe iii effect on ferrate oxidation of pmso were similar to the ones described above specifically since fe iii stock solution is acid the ph of borate buffer was re adjusted to 7 0 with naoh after the spike fe iii stock solution after that pmso and ferrate stock solutions were added in sequence to start the reaction all the kinetic experiments were independently repeated twice at least the average values were presented and the error bars represent the range observed in the two replicates the final solution ph was measured and the ph variations were within the range of 0 2 ph unit 2 3 stoichiometry experiments the reaction stoichiometry of ferrate and pmso was determined by measuring the generated pmso2 concentration after the complete reaction of ferrate with far excess of pmso at ph 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 serial glass beakers containing 10 ml of borate buffer solution were spiked with 20 µl pure pmso liquid melting point 32 c and the resulting pmso concentration was around 17 mm various calculated volumes of ferrate stock solution 4 mm were added to the beakers with magnetic stirring 150 r min to start the reaction with a resultant ferrate concentration ranging from 5 to 50 µm after the reaction completed an aliquot of 1 ml was sampled and filtered with a ptfe membrane 0 22 µm pore size the final solution ph was measured with a leici ph meter phs 3c shanghai and the ph variations were within the range of 0 2 ph unit the concentration of pmso2 was then analyzed by liquid chromatography 2 4 kinetic fitting the kinetic fitting and simulation of the mechanistic model for ferrate pmso reaction were carried out by a kinetic simulation software kintecus www kintecus com ianni 2003 specifically a powell fitting algorithm vetterling et al 1992 with a proprietary function as the comparison operator was selected to run the optimization a bootstrapping method iteration amount 1000 was applied to determine the standard deviations of the fit derived parameters ianni 2003 efron 1992 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction kinetics of ferrate and pmso at ph 7 0 buffer effect and ferrate dosage effect 3 1 1 in the condition of excess ferrate herein the reaction kinetics between ferrate and pmso were conducted comparatively in 10 mm borate and 10 mm phosphate at ph 7 0 the initial concentration of pmso was kept at 10 µm with varying excess ferrate concentration ferrate 0 20 30 50 µm the second order rate constant is obtained by plotting the natural logarithm of the target compounds concentration vs the fe vi exposure according to the equation shown as follows ln pmso t pmso 0 k app 0 t fe vi d t where pmso and fe vi represent the target compounds and ferrate concentration at time t k app represents the apparent second order rate constant of reaction between ferrate and pmso as shown in fig 1 the pmso consumption and pmso2 formation as a function of time were determined and found to be equivalent along the reaction the ferrate decay was simultaneously monitored figure s1 in borate buffer fig 1 a c after 10 min of reaction the pmso consumption increased from 6 1 to 9 4 µm as the ferrate dosage increased from 20 to 30 µm as the ferrate dosage further increased to 50 µm the oxidation rate increased dramatically where the 10 µm of pmso was completely oxidized to pmso2 within only 1 min similar trend was also observed in phosphate buffer fig 1 e g but the reaction rates were much slower theoretically the increase of ferrate dosage would promote the organic compounds elimination rate but should not alter the apparent second order rate constants k app if fe vi species was the only responsible oxidant house 2007 however as shown in fig 1 d h the k app value in borate buffer increased from 1 3 0 1 102 to 3 6 0 1 102 and 1 5 0 1 103 m 1s 1 as ferrate dosage increased from 20 to 30 and 50 µm respectively the k app values in phosphate buffer were also increased with ferrate dosage increasing but the values were smaller 34 1 39 1 and 54 1 m 1s 1 for ferrate dosages of 20 30 50 µm respectively and the trend was milder the maximum variation factor for k app value reduced from 11 5 in borate buffer to 1 6 in phosphate buffer similar oxidant dosage effect was also reported for ferrate oxidation of taste and odor compounds including 1 penten 3 one cis 3 hexen 1 ol and β ionone in phosphate buffered solutions at ph 7 0 but the underlying mechanism had not been revealed shin et al 2018 the results above show that increasing ferrate dosage could self enhance ferrate oxidation of pmso but the dosage effect was diminished to some extent by the presence of phosphate ligand 3 1 2 initial instant oxidation it should be noted that three kinetic lines for 20 30 50 µm ferrate dosage did not pass the zero point in fig 1 d h also sudden drops or lifts were found at the beginning of the pmso or pmso2 kinetic curves in fig 1 a c and e h the above phenomena indicate that an instant oxidation had occurred upon the ferrate addition which might be caused by the relative high concentration of ferrate at the dosing point when the oxidant diffusion proceeded to verify this speculation equal volume of ferrate solution and pmso solution were mixed together to start the kinetics experiment where the dosed ferrate solution concentration was lower to only 2 times of the final concentration and the diffusion process could be greatly shortened compared with the conventional ferrate dosing method of injecting concentrated ferrate stock solution figure s2 shows that the k app values determined by these two methods were identical within experimental error but the initial rapid pmso loss was eliminated in the 1 1 mixing group and the fitting line of ln c c0 vs fe vi exposure plot was nearly across the zero point the above result verifies that the instant oxidation gap during ferrate oxidation of pmso was caused by the initial insufficient mixing hence the slope of kinetic line excluding zero point would reflect the true k app value that did not cover the instant oxidation caused by initial insufficient mixing 3 1 3 in the condition of excess pmso ferrate self decomposition is inevitable when pmso is oxidized by excess ferrate in order to reveal the relationship between ferrate self decomposition and ferrate oxidation the reaction kinetics was also investigated comparatively in the condition of excess pmso where the ferrate self decomposition was lessened largely figs 2 and s3 as shown in fig 2 a b the pmso consumption was also found equal to pmso2 formation in the presence of excess pmso as the pmso concentration increased from 10 to 104 µm the reactions proceeded more rapidly but the experimental determined k app value turned out to be decreased for example the k app values for 20 30 and 50 µm ferrate dosage in borate buffer was lowered from 1 3 0 1 102 3 6 0 1 102 and 1 5 0 1 103 m 1s 1 to 43 2 54 2 and 74 3 m 1s 1 by factor of around 3 7 and 20 times respectively the corresponding k app values in phosphate buffer were decreased to be 33 4 36 2 and 39 2 m 1s 1 for ferrate dosage of 20 30 and 50 µm only a little smaller than the values in borate buffer compared to the condition of excess ferrate both the buffer effect and ferrate dosage effect on pmso oxidation kinetics were diminished greatly in the condition of excess pmso suggesting these two effects in excess ferrate are strongly related to ferrate self decomposition of which decomposition intermediate products i e fe v fe iv species might be involved in the pmso oxidation 3 2 role of fe v species in the pmso oxidation by ferrate 3 2 1 the cause of buffer effect and ferrate dosage effect no significant buffer effect was observed on the pmso oxidation kinetics for ferrate reaction with excess pmso contrast to the obvious inhibition effect of phosphate on pmso oxidation by excess ferrate this distinct buffer effect indicates that i the major iron species responsible for pmso oxidation are different in the conditions of excess pmso and excess ferrate ii the buffer influence ligand effect on pmso oxidation are varied with fe vi fe v and fe iv species the influence of buffer nature on reaction between fe vi species and pmso was investigated by monitoring the fe vi decay kinetics at varying excess dosage of pmso the fe vi decay kinetics could be described by the following rate law d fe vi d t k app fe vi pmso ln fe vi fe vi 0 k app pmso 0 t k obs t where k app represents the apparent second order rate constant and kobs represents the pseudo first order rate constant of reaction between ferrate and pmso as shown in fig 3 since the pmso concentration is not in far excess the kobs pmso 0 plot is not across the zero point and the intercept corresponds to the ferrate self decomposition the observed fe vi decay rate was positively dependent on pmso dosage where the slope yields a consistent second order rate constant k app of 40 m 1s 1 in both phosphate buffer and borate buffer the identical slopes in borate buffer and phosphate buffer reveal that the specific pmso oxidation by fe vi species was not influenced by phosphate the fe vi oxidation of abts a one electron transfer model compound was also found not influenced by phosphate in our previous study huang et al 2018 figure s4 shows that the fe vi oxidation of micropollutants like cbz and dcf were also not affected by phosphate the results above suggest that the imperviousness of fe vi species oxidation to phosphate is likely universal fe vi reacted with pmso via a two electron transfer mechanism producing equimolar of fe iv and pmso2 the initial reaction of ferrate self decomposition was also reported to produce fe iv species and h2o2 lee et al 2014 therefore sufficient amount of fe iv intermediate would be formed during the ferrate pmso reaction in both conditions of excess ferrate and excess pmso if the observed buffer effect in excess ferrate was caused by the ligand inhibition on fe iv oxidation of pmso then a remarkable buffer effect should be also observed in the condition of excess pmso which is in contrast to the experimental result hence both fe vi and fe iv species could be excluded for causing the buffer effect then the only possible iron species responsible for the observed buffer effect was fe v species of which oxidation would be greatly suppressed by phosphate complexation huang et al 2018 in ferrate pmso reaction system fe v was generated from the one electron reduction of fe vi by fe ii the reaction product of fe iv species with h2o2 or pmso since fe v was directly produced from fe vi species the fe v formation was dependent on the availability of fe vi species in the condition of excess pmso most fe vi was consumed by pmso and thus less fe v formation and fe v contribution for pmso oxidation was expected comparatively in the condition of excess ferrate more fe vi species were available to produce fe v species via ferrate self decomposition process for pmso oxidation as a result buffer effect is obvious in excess ferrate condition where the fe v concentration and contribution is prominent and no significant buffer effect was observed in excess pmso condition due to the much less fe v occurrence in this fashion the ferrate dosage effect observed in the condition of excess ferrate could be also explained by the involvement of fe v species derived from ferrate self decomposition which would be enhanced at higher ferrate dosage and concomitantly the fe v contribution on the other hand the ferrate dosage effect was weakened in phosphate buffer as the fe v oxidation would be inhibited by phosphate presence the role absence of fe iv species in buffer effect suggests that i fe iv reacted sluggishly with pmso at ph 7 0 and contributed barely to the overall pmso oxidation no matter in which buffer condition or ii the fe iv oxidation of pmso was not influenced by the phosphate presence like fe vi species the former consequence implies that fe iv was not involved in the pmso oxidation then there was no place for fe iv to cause the ferrate dosage effect on pmso oxidation the latter one was against the phenomenon that ferrate dosage effect was eliminated by a large extent in phosphate buffer therefore fe iv would not be the cause of ferrate dosage effect at ph 7 0 3 2 2 counterbalance of ferrate dosage effect by pyrophosphate if the mechanism proposed above is true the oxidant dosage effect in borate buffer is expected to be counterbalanced with the presence of an appropriate amount of a much stronger ligand like pyrophosphate as shown in figure s5 in the condition of excess ferrate 0 1 mm pyrophosphate greatly inhibited the reaction between ferrate and pmso compared with oxidation kinetics in borate buffer fig 1 a d but was not sufficient to completely diminish the ferrate dosage effect k app 31 1 34 3 43 2 m 1s 1 for 20 30 50 µm ferrate dosage respectively increasing the pyrophosphate concentration to 1 mm the k app values were reduced to a relatively constant level around 30 m 1s 1 for all ferrate dosages of 20 30 50 µm fig 4 a b in the condition of excess pmso fig 4 c d the k app values were also obtained at a similar level around 30 m 1s 1 with the presence of 1 mm pyrophosphate the consistent values 30 m 1s 1 in pyrophosphate buffer prove that the ferrate dosage effect was induced by fe v oxidation which was completely sequestered in 1 mm pyrophosphate buffer at ph 8 0 1 mm pyrophosphate could also diminish the ferrate dosage effect reducing the k app values from 16 1 18 1 and 25 1 m 1s 1 for 20 30 and 50 µm ferrate to a consistent value around 9 m 1s 1 figure s6 compared with that at ph 7 0 the reaction was much slower and the ferrate dosage effect was also much weaker at ph 8 0 the results above could be rationalized by the fact that ferrate self decomposition is faster at lower ph which favors the generation of fe v species from ferrate self decomposition and thus the pmso oxidation lee et al 2014 besides the fe v reactivity was also dependent on solution ph which was reported to be more reactive at lower ph sharma and o connor 2000 sharma 2002 sharma et al 2004 therefore the ferrate dosage effect is more prominent at lower ph 3 3 mechanistic kinetic modeling 3 3 1 model development based on the experimental results and analyses above a kinetic model involving the ferrate self decomposition pmso oxidation by fe vi fe v and fe iv species was proposed to simulate the ferrate pmso reaction at ph 7 0 fig 8 and table 1 the kinetics and mechanism of ferrate self decomposition have been investigated in depth recently lee et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 lee et al reported that the self decomposition kinetics of ferrate was second order at ph 7 0 in phosphate buffer lee et al 2014 it started with the rate limiting dimerization of two fe vi species to form a di ferrate vi intermediate which finally hydrolyzed into two fe iv species and h2o2 eq 1 the fe iv species further oxidized h2o2 to o2 producing fe ii as product eq 2 fe ii then reduced fe vi species via one electron transfer generating fe v species and fe iii eq 3 the fe v species then underwent self decomposition reaction including first order reaction and second order reaction both of which generated fe iii and h2o2 as products eq 5 6 both fe vi species and fe v species could also oxidize h2o2 into o2 through a two electron transfer process eq 4 7 jiang reported that the heterogeneous ferrate self decomposition catalyzed by fe iii particles could be described by first order reaction and thus ferrate self decomposition in borate buffer followed mixed first and second order kinetics jiang et al 2015 however we found that the reaction order of ferrate self decomposition was dependent on ph but not on buffer condition si text 3 figure s7 and table s1 in both phosphate buffer and borate buffer a second order kinetics could describe the ferrate decomposition well at ph 6 0 and 7 0 while a first order kinetics fit successfully at ph 9 0 for ph 8 0 a mixed first and second order kinetics has to be used the reaction order of ferrate self decomposition seems related to different ferrate species hfeo4 and feo4 2 of which distribution is ph dependent sharma 2011 but not due to the homogeneous or heterogeneous reaction the recent work on ferrate self decomposition in alkaline condition by luo et al also observed the first order decay of feo4 2 species and demonstrated by density functional theory dft calculation that the feo4 2 species favored unimolecular decay mechanism through water attack wa other than the dimerization through oxo coupling oc luo et al 2020 nevertheless the enhance effect of the fe iii particles on ferrate self decomposition was confirmed here on the basis of the larger rate constant at higher ferrate dosage or with increasing external fe iii dosage in borate buffer figures s8 s9 and table s1 therefore only a second order ferrate self decomposition reaction eq 1 was included in the kinetic model at ph 7 0 the corresponding rate constant k1 in phosphate and pyrophosphate buffer was set as 22 m 1s 1 a value determined from ferrate self decomposition kinetics experiment figures s10 s11 table s1 in borate buffer considering the possible varying heterogeneous fe iii catalytic effect on ferrate self decomposition the rate constant of eq 1 was set as a pending parameter k1 pmso was oxidized to pmso2 by fe vi fe v and fe iv species via two electron transfer mechanism with fe iv fe iii and fe ii as the iron products eq 9 11 the corresponding rate constants are denoted as k2 k3 and k4 respectively all the other rate constants of reactions in table 1 under different buffer conditions were determined estimated based on kinetic information from literatures and more details are provided in si text 4 figures s12 s27 3 3 2 model fitting in pyrophosphate buffer and phosphate buffer as discussed in the above section on buffer effect the fe v oxidation was completely sequestered in pyrophosphate buffer because of strong ligand complexation but it s not clear whether fe iv play a role in the pmso oxidation at ph 7 0 based on the role absence of fe iv in the buffer effect of pmso oxidation it could be deducted that fe iv might either react poorly with pmso or its oxidation was not influenced by ligand presence to gain insight into the role of fe iv in pmso oxidation the mechanistic kinetic model proposed above was used to fit the concentration time profiles of fe vi pmso and pmso2 acquired in pyrophosphate buffer through a global fitting function with multiple data sets of varying ferrate dosages firstly rate constants between pmso and fe vi fe iv species k2 and k4 were set as pending parameters while reaction between fe v and pmso was excluded from the kinetic model for mechanism reduction to run a preliminary model fitting the rate constant of fe vi and pmso was determined to be 25 6 m 1s 1 somewhat close to the experimental determined k app value 30 m 1s 1 in pyrophosphate buffer comparatively an upper limit was derived for the rate constant of fe iv species and pmso k4 1 5 10 2 m 1s 1 instead of a precise value with standard deviation suggesting the reactivity between fe iv and pmso was extremely low at ph 7 0 and the fe iv contribution to pmso oxidation was negligible therefore the role absence of fe iv in buffer effect was likely due to the sluggish fe iv reactivity towards pmso at ph 7 0 rather than the alternative hypothesis that the fe iv oxidation of pmso was impervious to ligand presence this explanation was also in agreement with the reported poor oxidation performance on pmso by fe ii h2o2 bataineh et al 2012 fe ii pds wang et al 2018 dong et al 2020 fe ii pms wang et al 2019b and fe ii paa kim et al 2019 system at circumneutral ph conditions where fe iv species was proposed as the major reactive species in a recent study it s reported that fe iv species did contribute to the pmso oxidation at ph 8 0 in borate buffer zhu et al 2020 contrast to the result at ph 7 0 in this study to further investigate the role of fe iv during ferrate oxidation stoichiometry experiment of ferrate and pmso was conducted at ph ranging from 6 0 to 9 0 in borate buffer as shown in fig 5 the δ pmso2 δ fe vi ratio was determined to be larger than one 1 2 at ph 8 0 and 9 0 proving the fe iv involvement in pmso oxidation at alkaline condition see si text 5 for more details comparatively the molar ratio reduced to around unity at ph 6 0 and 7 0 in agreement with the model fitting result that fe iv reacted sluggishly with pmso at ph 7 0 and thus contributed barely to the pmso oxidation the results above reveals that the role of fe iv species is strongly dependent on solution ph and fe iv might be less reactive at near neutral conditions hence the reaction between fe iv and pmso eq 11 is a redundant step in the kinetic model and could be excluded for mechanism reduction in the following model fitting further the averaged value of k app experimentally obtained in pyrophosphate buffer could be recognized as the specific rate constant k2 of fe vi species with pmso i e k2 30 m 1s 1 with negligible involvement of fe v and fe iv species then the k3 value for fe v and pmso was estimated to be k3 2 5 105 m 1s 1 in pyrophosphate by adopting the above parameter setting through model fitting through the same approach the k3 value was determined to be 1 5 34 106 m 1s 1 in phosphate buffer in agreement with the reported rate constant range of 105 106 m 1s 1 reported for fe v species oxidizing organic compounds including phenol rush et al 1995 amino acid rush and bielski 1995 and carboxylic acid bielski et al 1994 in phosphate buffer from pulse radiolysis studies 3 3 3 model fitting in borate buffer since the ferrate self decomposition was self enhanced with increasing ferrate dosage due to the greater amount of fe iii formed at higher ferrate dosage the k1 value was set as another pending parameter besides k3 considering the fe iii enhanced effect might vary in different conditions unlike the condition of pyrophosphate and phosphate it was unsuccessful to simultaneously fit the multiple data sets of varying ferrate dosages with a global fitting function in borate buffer therefore model fitting was conducted individually at 20 30 and 50 µm ferrate dosage as shown in fig 1 the model fitted all the data sets well and the fitting results were summarized in table 2 the k1 value was determined to be 38 1 43 5 and 82 1 m 1s 1 for ferrate dosage of 20 30 and 50 µm respectively consistent with the increasing trend of decomposition rate constants observed in sole ferrate self decomposition experiments table s1 the k3 value of fe v and pmso was determined to be 1 52 107 m 1s 1 at 20 µm ferrate 6 orders of magnitude higher than that of fe vi species 30 m 1s 1 and only 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding rate constants of sulfate radical 3 17 108 m 1s 1 or hydroxyl radical 3 61 109 m 1s 1 the k3 value increased to 5 11 107 m 1s 1 at 30 µm ferrate and 1 07 108 m 1s 1 at 50 µm ferrate approaching rates of typical radical reaction the very high reactivity of fe v species with pmso corroborated the partial radical character of the oxide ligands bound to fe v rush and bielski 1989 1995 bielski 1992 based on the ferrate dosage effect on k3 values we speculated that the oxidation of pmso by fe v species was also enhanced by the in situ formed fe iii derived from ferrate reduction similar to the ferrate self decomposition eq 1 the enhancement caused by fe iii is a heterogeneous process which would be suppressed by ligand presence as ligand could form complexes with fe iii ions or cover the surfaces of fe iii particles therefore a uniform fitting result could be obtained for varying ferrate dosages in pyrophosphate or phosphate buffer through a global fitting function but not in borate buffer where fe iii particles play an important role in pmso oxidation 3 3 4 enhanced effect of fe iii on fe v oxidation to verify the speculated enhanced effect of fe iii on fe v oxidation of pmso varying dosages of fecl3 were introduced into the system in advance to investigate the effect of external fe iii on the oxidation of pmso by 20 µm ferrate in borate buffer at ph 7 0 as shown in fig 6 the addition of fecl3 significantly accelerated the oxidation of pmso by ferrate the apparent second order rate constants k app were determined to be 2 5 102 3 7 102 and 5 1 102 m 1s 1 for the fecl3 dosage of 5 20 and 50 µm respectively these values were larger by factors of 1 92 2 85 and 3 92 respectively than the corresponding k app value of single ferrate dose besides the addition of fecl3 show no influence on the pmso oxidation in phosphate buffer data not shown confirming the phosphate retardation on the fe iii enhancement proposed above the specific effect of external fe iii on fe vi species oxidation was also investigated by monitoring the fe vi decay under varying dosages of excess pmso fig 3 shows that the k app remain consistent around 40 m 1s 1 in borate buffer with or without external fe iii present indicating that the specific fe vi oxidation was not influenced by fe iii since the role of fe iv was excluded in pmso oxidation at ph 7 0 in both borate and phosphate buffer the fe iii enhancement mechanism was likely related to fe v oxidation fe v species was generated from the serial reactions of ferrate self decomposition the presence of fe iii might promote the fe v generation from ferrate decomposition due to its catalytic effect on ferrate self decomposition jiang et al 2015 in this sense the decrease of fe vi exposure would result in a corresponding increase of fe v exposure as fe vi species transformed into fe v species during the ferrate decomposition and thus enhance the pmso oxidation by fe v oxidation fig 5 c shows that ferrate decomposed faster as the external fe iii dosage increased at reaction time of 10 min the fe vi exposure decreased from 6 04 to 3 57 mm s as the fe iii dosage increased from 0 to 50 µm in theory the fe v exposure would correspondingly increase by 1 69 times at most however the pmso oxidation performance in terms of ln pmso pmso 0 increased by 2 16 times higher than the corresponding theoretical fe v exposure augmentation factor these results suggest that the reactivity of fe v with pmso was also enhanced by fe iii which accord precisely with the increasing k3 value at higher ferrate dosage derived from model fitting in borate buffer table 2 when the external fe iii was prepared from ferrate self decomposition an oxidation enhancement with increasing fe vi origin fe iii dosage was also observed figure s28 revealing the self enhanced nature of ferrate pmso oxidation process 3 3 5 model validation and relative contribution of fe vi and fe v species the rate constants derived from the data fitting in the condition of excess ferrate table 2 was used to predict the kinetic data of excess pmso by model simulation as shown in figs 2 and 4 c the model successfully predicted the kinetic curves of pmso and pmso2 of varying ferrate dosages under excess pmso in all buffer conditions validating the model proposed above is robust and reasonable the k app value experimentally determined by monitoring the fe vi decay under varying dosage of excess pmso 40 m 1s 1 turned out to be a little higher than the k app value determined under excess ferrate in pyrophosphate buffer 30 m 1s 1 which was recognized as the true rate constant between fe vi species and pmso at ph 7 0 this mismatch appears to be unexpected since the k app value was determined in the condition where ferrate self decomposition was minimized and was also expected to reflect the true rate constant between fe vi and pmso the kinetic model in table 1 was utilized to simulate the reaction of ferrate with varying dosage of excess pmso interestingly model simulation also yields a k app value of around 40 m 1s 1 fig 3c in the ferrate pmso system fe vi was consumed by fe vi self decomposition eq 1 and reaction with fe ii eq 3 h2o2 eq 4 pmso eq 11 model simulation shows that in the excess of pmso the contributions of fe vi self decomposition and reaction with h2o2 were negligible 2 and 0 while reactions with fe ii and pmso were the major contributors 29 and 69 that is to say about 69 of the k app determined by monitoring the fe vi decay under excess pmso reflect the true rate constant between fe vi and pmso 69 40 27 6 m 1s 1 exactly close to the 30 m 1s 1 determined in pyrophosphate buffer although the fe ii concentration in ferrate pmso system was quite low 1 5 10 9 m the reaction between fe ii and fe vi was extremely fast 1 107 m 1s 1 lee et al 2014 and thus contribute fairly to the fe vi consumption even under excess pmso the contribution ratios of fe vi and fe v species on the pmso oxidation under various conditions were calculated and shown in fig 7 see si text s6 for calculation details in the condition of excess ferrate the contribution of fe v species to the total pmso oxidation in borate buffer was determined to be 73 90 and 98 at the ferrate dosage of 20 30 and 50 µm respectively this result reveals that fe v was the prevailing active species when excess ferrate oxidized pmso in borate buffer at ph 7 0 and its dominant role was enhanced at higher ferrate dosage on one hand higher ferrate dosage would increase the competitiveness of fe vi self decomposition pathway eq 1 over the direct fe vi pmso oxidation pathway eq 9 producing a greater amount of fe v species and leading to a higher fe v exposure on the other hand more fe iii generated from ferrate reduction would also be beneficial for the fe v oxidative reactivity through heterogeneous enhancement in phosphate buffer the corresponding contributions of fe v species reduced to 17 20 and 30 respectively where fe vi species predominated the pmso oxidation in turn in pyrophosphate buffer the contribution of fe vi species increased to around 99 at 20 30 50 µm ferrate dosage whereas fe v species contributed negligibly as the condition switched from excess ferrate to excess pmso the corresponding fe v contributions decreased in all buffer conditions for example the fe v contributions decreased from 73 90 and 98 to 40 47 and 66 in borate buffer for ferrate dosages of 20 30 and 50 µm this decreasing trend of fe v contribution was in agreement with the decreasing k app values and diminishing ferrate dosage effect from excess ferrate to excess pmso overall the above results were consistent with the dosage effect and buffer effect on the k app variation observed in the kinetic experiments a higher k app value at raised ferrate dosage or weaker ligand presence was clearly corresponded to a higher fe v contribution 3 4 practical application the ferrate self decomposition used to be considered as an undesirable reaction which would consume significant amount of ferrate and potentially decrease the oxidation efficiency for micropollutants abatement taking pmso as a model organic compound this study reveals that without the presence of strong ligands the oxidation of target compounds was mainly achieved by fe v species generated from ferrate self decomposition especially at relative high ferrate dosage or with fe iii promotion therefore ferrate self decomposition is not just a self degradation but also a self activation process during which fe vi species is transformed into the more reactive fe v species for oxidation in this regard accelerating the ferrate self decomposition could be used to enhance the ferrate oxidation of micropollutants introducing external fe iii e g dosing fecl3 could promote the fe v species generation from ferrate self decomposition for pmso oxidation more importantly the heterogeneous fe iii enhancement on fe v oxidation improved the competitiveness of fe v oxidation pathway over fe v auto decomposition and thus elevated the utilization efficiency of ferrate oxidation capacity reducing the ferrate dosage required the addition of external fecl3 was proved to be able to enhance the ferrate oxidation of micropollutants like smx over a wide ph range figure s29 the in situ formed fe iii particles in ferrate reaction are reported to be composed of both amorphous and crystalline fe iii lv et al 2018 whereas the fe iii particles derived from direct fe iii hydrolysis is amorphous ching et al 1994 duan and gregory 2003 implying that the amorphous part of fe iii particles play the simulative role nevertheless whether the crystal form of fe iii oxides and other transition metal oxides could also catalyze the ferrate oxidation as well as the influence of other characteristics like particle size and morphology deserves further investigation during the ferrate oxidation of micropollutants like cbz and dcf figure s30 apparent ferrate dosage effect was also observed in borate buffer which was then counterbalanced in pyrophosphate similar to ferrate oxidation of pmso it s very likely that fe v derived from ferrate self decomposition contributed to the micropollutants oxidation and partly caused the ferrate dosage effect and buffer effect ferrate dosage effect on cbz oxidation was also observed in river water matrix doc 17 0 0 5 mgc l figure s31 revealing that the ferrate dosage effect as well as the ferrate self activation process was also present in actual water samples the k app values in borate buffered river water samples were lower than the corresponding values in borate buffered pure water samples this might be ascribed to the following two reasons 1 the complexing components of natural organic matters nom would inhibit the ferrate oxidation via complexing intermediate iron species adusei gyamfi et al 2019 2 the reductive components of nom would competitively consume the active intermediate iron species kappler and haderlein 2003 as a highly reactive and unstable species the oxidation reactivity of fe iv species was reported to be lower than that of fe v species sharma 2011 sharma 2013 in this study the rate constant of fe iv with pmso at ph 7 0 was found 1 5 10 2 m 1s 1 and fe iv contributed negligibly to the pmso oxidation however the reactivity of fe iv with other micropollutants remains unknown it is still unable to confirm or negate the role of fe iv during the ferrate oxidation of micropollutants getting knowledge of the ligand effect on fe iv oxidation could help us to further distinguish the relative contributions of fe vi fe v fe iv during the ferrate oxidation of micropollutants and facilitate our understanding of ferrate chemistry 4 conclusions the oxidant dosage effect on ferrate oxidation of pmso higher k app values at higher ferrate dosage could be counterbalanced by pyrophosphate addition similar phenomena were observed for ferrate oxidation of micropollutants like cbz and dcf the fe v species derived from ferrate self decomposition was responsible for the ferrate dosage effect and was the major oxidant during ferrate oxidation of pmso therefore ferrate self decomposition was also a self activation process forming fe v species to oxidize target compounds fe vi oxidation was impervious to phosphate while fe v oxidation was strongly suppressed by phosphate complexation the in situ formed fe iii or external fe iii was found to enhance the ferrate oxidation of pmso by promoting the fe v oxidation declaration of competing interest the authors

17043,to reveal the role of ferrate self decomposition and the fates of intermediate iron species fe v fe iv species during ferrate oxidation the reaction between ferrate and methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso at ph 7 0 was investigated as a model system in this study interestingly the apparent second order rate constants k app between ferrate and pmso was found to increase with ferrate dosage in the condition of excess ferrate in borate buffer this ferrate dosage effect was diminished greatly in the condition of excess pmso where ferrate self decomposition was lessened largely or counterbalanced by adding a strong complexing ligand e g pyrophosphate to sequester fe v oxidation demonstrating that the fe v species derived from ferrate self decomposition plays an important role in pmso oxidation a mechanistic kinetics model involving the ferrate self decomposition and pmso oxidation by fe vi fe v and fe iv species was then developed and validated the modeling results show that up to 99 of the pmso oxidation was contributed by the ferrate self decomposition resultant fe v species in borate buffer revealing that ferrate self decomposition is also a self activation process the direct fe vi oxidation of pmso was impervious to presence of phosphate or fe iii while the fe v oxidation pathway was strongly inhibited by phosphate complexation or enhanced with fe iii similar ferrate dosage effect and its counterbalance by pyrophosphate as well as the fe iii enhancement were also observed in ferrate oxidation of micropollutants like carbamazepine diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole implying the general role of fe v and promising fe iii enhancement during ferrate oxidation of micropollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate intermediate iron species oxidation micropollutants kinetics 1 introduction ferrate has been considered as a green and potent chemical with multiple functions in water treatment for many years sharma et al 2015 ma and liu 2002a ma and liu 2002b chen et al 2018a chen et al 2018b as a powerful oxidant ferrate is effective in abating micropollutants from water especially organic compounds with electron rich moieties like phenols olefins anilines and amines lee et al 2009 liu et al 2018 sun et al 2018 ferrate is also a promising disinfectant efficacious for inactivating bacteria and viruses meanwhile it has a satisfactory control of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps formation schink and waite 1980 hu et al 2012 fan et al 2018 cui et al 2020 gombos et al 2012 wang et al 2019a further the resultant iron iii oxide hydroxide particles from ferrate reduction show great capacity in removing arsenic selenite heavy metals and total organic compounds yang et al 2018a viktor et al 2020 liu et al 2017 yang et al 2018b the intrinsic drawback of ferrate might be its instability in aqueous solution which causes great challenge and difficulty in the ferrate preparation storage and transportation sharma et al 2015 the ferrate self decomposition is highly ph and dosage dependent which is accelerated at acidic condition and high dosage lee et al 2014 during the ferrate self decomposition fe vi is reduced to fe iii by water via the intermediacy of fe iv and fe v species of which reactivity was reported to be several orders of magnitude higher than that of the parent fe vi and might contribute to the micropollutants elimination during ferrate oxidation sharma 2011 sharma 2013 sharma et al 2001 however the fe v fe iv species are also highly unstable and short lived in aqueous solution resulting in low oxidant exposure rush and bielski 1989 melton and bielski 1990 therefore whether ferrate self decomposition is just a self degradation process consuming oxidation capacity or a self activation process transforming fe vi into the more reactive fe v fe iv species for oxidation has remained unclear it depends on whether the fe v fe iv species are taking part into the target compounds oxidation and to what extent they contribute to the overall ferrate oxidation exploring the reaction properties of the fe v fe iv species could help to understand their roles and fates during the ferrate oxidation process in a previous study we found that the oxidative reactivity of fe v species could be greatly reduced upon phosphate complexation which depressed the overall ferrate oxidation performance huang et al 2018 on one hand we concluded that the actual oxidation ability of ferrate was underestimated because of the prevalent use of phosphate buffer in lab experiments relevant to ferrate on the other hand based on the chemical characteristic that the fe v species oxidation could be sequestered upon phosphate or pyrophosphate ligand complexation we hypothesized that the reaction selectivity and relative contribution of fe v species might be investigated by comparing the ferrate oxidation performance in solution with or without the presence of phosphate ligand to accurately obtain the relative contribution of a specific species during a complex reaction involving multiple active species a normal way is to develop a chemistry kinetic model consisting of major elementary reactions and corresponding rate constants in this model approach the selection of target compound is crucial for studying the fates of fe v fe iv species during ferrate oxidation good candidate compounds are those whose reaction mechanisms are known as one or two electron transfer which indicate that fe v or fe iv species is primarily produced from fe vi reduction abts is a typical compound of one electron transfer mechanism and its initial oxidation product abts is easy to be monitored spectrophotometrically at wavelength of 415 nm however abts would be further oxidized to other unknown products in the excess of ferrate xue et al 2020 making the excess ferrate abts system too complicated it was reported that some sulfoxide compounds such as dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso could be oxidized by ferrate with a two electron transfer mechanism generating the corresponding sulfones as products which would not be further oxidized by excess ferrate pang et al 2011 shao et al 2019 besides both pmso and pmso2 methyl phenyl sulfone could be readily analyzed by liquid chromatography pang et al 2011 wang et al 2018 the enhanced ferrate oxidation of organic pollutants e g diclofenac zhao et al 2018a zhao et al 2018b and sulfamethoxazole shao et al 2019 with fe iii addition have been reported in unbuffered or borate buffered systems the catalytic effect of fe iii particles on ferrate self decomposition jiang et al 2015 and the concomitant accelerated formation of active intermediate iron species lee et al 2014 were proposed as the underlying mechanism however the discussion was rather general and no solid evidence or quantitative analysis is available by now in this study the ferrate pmso reaction was systematically investigated as a model system of two electron transfer mechanism to provide basic information on the fates of fe v fe iv species and the role of ferrate self decomposition during ferrate oxidation the oxidation kinetics of pmso by varying dosage of ferrate were comparatively investigated in the condition of excess ferrate or excess pmso in borate buffer or phosphate buffer at ph 7 0 a mechanistic kinetic model was then developed to quantitatively explain the oxidant dosage effect observed and gain further insights into the fe iii enhanced effect 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents

0 7 µm prior to use relevant parameters are shown in table s2 2 2 kinetic experiments kinetic studies of pmso oxidation by ferrate were investigated in different buffer conditions at ph 7 0 the batch experiments were conducted in glass flasks with rapid magnetic stirring 500 r min at room temperature 25 0 2 c maintained by a water bath an aliquot of pmso stock solution 10 mm was spiked into the 150 ml system for a target concentration of 10 or 104 µm various calculated volumes of ferrate stock solution for different ferrate dosages 20 30 50 µm were added to start the kinetic runs two sample aliquots were sampled simultaneously at proper time intervals one sample was immediately quenched with excess hydroxylamine 20 µl of 10 w w nh2oh hcl johnson and hornstein 2003 feng et al 2018 and filtered through a ptfe membrane 0 22 µm pore size before pmso and pmso2 concentration measurement with liquid chromatography si text 2 another sample was quenched with an abts solution to determine the residual ferrate concentrations lee et al 2014 the experimental procedures of the investigation of fe iii effect on ferrate oxidation of pmso were similar to the ones described above specifically since fe iii stock solution is acid the ph of borate buffer was re adjusted to 7 0 with naoh after the spike fe iii stock solution after that pmso and ferrate stock solutions were added in sequence to start the reaction all the kinetic experiments were independently repeated twice at least the average values were presented and the error bars represent the range observed in the two replicates the final solution ph was measured and the ph variations were within the range of 0 2 ph unit 2 3 stoichiometry experiments the reaction stoichiometry of ferrate and pmso was determined by measuring the generated pmso2 concentration after the complete reaction of ferrate with far excess of pmso at ph 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 9 0 serial glass beakers containing 10 ml of borate buffer solution were spiked with 20 µl pure pmso liquid melting point 32 c and the resulting pmso concentration was around 17 mm various calculated volumes of ferrate stock solution 4 mm were added to the beakers with magnetic stirring 150 r min to start the reaction with a resultant ferrate concentration ranging from 5 to 50 µm after the reaction completed an aliquot of 1 ml was sampled and filtered with a ptfe membrane 0 22 µm pore size the final solution ph was measured with a leici ph meter phs 3c shanghai and the ph variations were within the range of 0 2 ph unit the concentration of pmso2 was then analyzed by liquid chromatography 2 4 kinetic fitting the kinetic fitting and simulation of the mechanistic model for ferrate pmso reaction were carried out by a kinetic simulation software kintecus www kintecus com ianni 2003 specifically a powell fitting algorithm vetterling et al 1992 with a proprietary function as the comparison operator was selected to run the optimization a bootstrapping method iteration amount 1000 was applied to determine the standard deviations of the fit derived parameters ianni 2003 efron 1992 3 results and discussion 3 1 reaction kinetics of ferrate and pmso at ph 7 0 buffer effect and ferrate dosage effect 3 1 1 in the condition of excess ferrate herein the reaction kinetics between ferrate and pmso were conducted comparatively in 10 mm borate and 10 mm phosphate at ph 7 0 the initial concentration of pmso was kept at 10 µm with varying excess ferrate concentration ferrate 0 20 30 50 µm the second order rate constant is obtained by plotting the natural logarithm of the target compounds concentration vs the fe vi exposure according to the equation shown as follows ln pmso t pmso 0 k app 0 t fe vi d t where pmso and fe vi represent the target compounds and ferrate concentration at time t k app represents the apparent second order rate constant of reaction between ferrate and pmso as shown in fig 1 the pmso consumption and pmso2 formation as a function of time were determined and found to be equivalent along the reaction the ferrate decay was simultaneously monitored figure s1 in borate buffer fig 1 a c after 10 min of reaction the pmso consumption increased from 6 1 to 9 4 µm as the ferrate dosage increased from 20 to 30 µm as the ferrate dosage further increased to 50 µm the oxidation rate increased dramatically where the 10 µm of pmso was completely oxidized to pmso2 within only 1 min similar trend was also observed in phosphate buffer fig 1 e g but the reaction rates were much slower theoretically the increase of ferrate dosage would promote the organic compounds elimination rate but should not alter the apparent second order rate constants k app if fe vi species was the only responsible oxidant house 2007 however as shown in fig 1 d h the k app value in borate buffer increased from 1 3 0 1 102 to 3 6 0 1 102 and 1 5 0 1 103 m 1s 1 as ferrate dosage increased from 20 to 30 and 50 µm respectively the k app values in phosphate buffer were also increased with ferrate dosage increasing but the values were smaller 34 1 39 1 and 54 1 m 1s 1 for ferrate dosages of 20 30 50 µm respectively and the trend was milder the maximum variation factor for k app value reduced from 11 5 in borate buffer to 1 6 in phosphate buffer similar oxidant dosage effect was also reported for ferrate oxidation of taste and odor compounds including 1 penten 3 one cis 3 hexen 1 ol and β ionone in phosphate buffered solutions at ph 7 0 but the underlying mechanism had not been revealed shin et al 2018 the results above show that increasing ferrate dosage could self enhance ferrate oxidation of pmso but the dosage effect was diminished to some extent by the presence of phosphate ligand 3 1 2 initial instant oxidation it should be noted that three kinetic lines for 20 30 50 µm ferrate dosage did not pass the zero point in fig 1 d h also sudden drops or lifts were found at the beginning of the pmso or pmso2 kinetic curves in fig 1 a c and e h the above phenomena indicate that an instant oxidation had occurred upon the ferrate addition which might be caused by the relative high concentration of ferrate at the dosing point when the oxidant diffusion proceeded to verify this speculation equal volume of ferrate solution and pmso solution were mixed together to start the kinetics experiment where the dosed ferrate solution concentration was lower to only 2 times of the final concentration and the diffusion process could be greatly shortened compared with the conventional ferrate dosing method of injecting concentrated ferrate stock solution figure s2 shows that the k app values determined by these two methods were identical within experimental error but the initial rapid pmso loss was eliminated in the 1 1 mixing group and the fitting line of ln c c0 vs fe vi exposure plot was nearly across the zero point the above result verifies that the instant oxidation gap during ferrate oxidation of pmso was caused by the initial insufficient mixing hence the slope of kinetic line excluding zero point would reflect the true k app value that did not cover the instant oxidation caused by initial insufficient mixing 3 1 3 in the condition of excess pmso ferrate self decomposition is inevitable when pmso is oxidized by excess ferrate in order to reveal the relationship between ferrate self decomposition and ferrate oxidation the reaction kinetics was also investigated comparatively in the condition of excess pmso where the ferrate self decomposition was lessened largely figs 2 and s3 as shown in fig 2 a b the pmso consumption was also found equal to pmso2 formation in the presence of excess pmso as the pmso concentration increased from 10 to 104 µm the reactions proceeded more rapidly but the experimental determined k app value turned out to be decreased for example the k app values for 20 30 and 50 µm ferrate dosage in borate buffer was lowered from 1 3 0 1 102 3 6 0 1 102 and 1 5 0 1 103 m 1s 1 to 43 2 54 2 and 74 3 m 1s 1 by factor of around 3 7 and 20 times respectively the corresponding k app values in phosphate buffer were decreased to be 33 4 36 2 and 39 2 m 1s 1 for ferrate dosage of 20 30 and 50 µm only a little smaller than the values in borate buffer compared to the condition of excess ferrate both the buffer effect and ferrate dosage effect on pmso oxidation kinetics were diminished greatly in the condition of excess pmso suggesting these two effects in excess ferrate are strongly related to ferrate self decomposition of which decomposition intermediate products i e fe v fe iv species might be involved in the pmso oxidation 3 2 role of fe v species in the pmso oxidation by ferrate 3 2 1 the cause of buffer effect and ferrate dosage effect no significant buffer effect was observed on the pmso oxidation kinetics for ferrate reaction with excess pmso contrast to the obvious inhibition effect of phosphate on pmso oxidation by excess ferrate this distinct buffer effect indicates that i the major iron species responsible for pmso oxidation are different in the conditions of excess pmso and excess ferrate ii the buffer influence ligand effect on pmso oxidation are varied with fe vi fe v and fe iv species the influence of buffer nature on reaction between fe vi species and pmso was investigated by monitoring the fe vi decay kinetics at varying excess dosage of pmso the fe vi decay kinetics could be described by the following rate law d fe vi d t k app fe vi pmso ln fe vi fe vi 0 k app pmso 0 t k obs t where k app represents the apparent second order rate constant and kobs represents the pseudo first order rate constant of reaction between ferrate and pmso as shown in fig 3 since the pmso concentration is not in far excess the kobs pmso 0 plot is not across the zero point and the intercept corresponds to the ferrate self decomposition the observed fe vi decay rate was positively dependent on pmso dosage where the slope yields a consistent second order rate constant k app of 40 m 1s 1 in both phosphate buffer and borate buffer the identical slopes in borate buffer and phosphate buffer reveal that the specific pmso oxidation by fe vi species was not influenced by phosphate the fe vi oxidation of abts a one electron transfer model compound was also found not influenced by phosphate in our previous study huang et al 2018 figure s4 shows that the fe vi oxidation of micropollutants like cbz and dcf were also not affected by phosphate the results above suggest that the imperviousness of fe vi species oxidation to phosphate is likely universal fe vi reacted with pmso via a two electron transfer mechanism producing equimolar of fe iv and pmso2 the initial reaction of ferrate self decomposition was also reported to produce fe iv species and h2o2 lee et al 2014 therefore sufficient amount of fe iv intermediate would be formed during the ferrate pmso reaction in both conditions of excess ferrate and excess pmso if the observed buffer effect in excess ferrate was caused by the ligand inhibition on fe iv oxidation of pmso then a remarkable buffer effect should be also observed in the condition of excess pmso which is in contrast to the experimental result hence both fe vi and fe iv species could be excluded for causing the buffer effect then the only possible iron species responsible for the observed buffer effect was fe v species of which oxidation would be greatly suppressed by phosphate complexation huang et al 2018 in ferrate pmso reaction system fe v was generated from the one electron reduction of fe vi by fe ii the reaction product of fe iv species with h2o2 or pmso since fe v was directly produced from fe vi species the fe v formation was dependent on the availability of fe vi species in the condition of excess pmso most fe vi was consumed by pmso and thus less fe v formation and fe v contribution for pmso oxidation was expected comparatively in the condition of excess ferrate more fe vi species were available to produce fe v species via ferrate self decomposition process for pmso oxidation as a result buffer effect is obvious in excess ferrate condition where the fe v concentration and contribution is prominent and no significant buffer effect was observed in excess pmso condition due to the much less fe v occurrence in this fashion the ferrate dosage effect observed in the condition of excess ferrate could be also explained by the involvement of fe v species derived from ferrate self decomposition which would be enhanced at higher ferrate dosage and concomitantly the fe v contribution on the other hand the ferrate dosage effect was weakened in phosphate buffer as the fe v oxidation would be inhibited by phosphate presence the role absence of fe iv species in buffer effect suggests that i fe iv reacted sluggishly with pmso at ph 7 0 and contributed barely to the overall pmso oxidation no matter in which buffer condition or ii the fe iv oxidation of pmso was not influenced by the phosphate presence like fe vi species the former consequence implies that fe iv was not involved in the pmso oxidation then there was no place for fe iv to cause the ferrate dosage effect on pmso oxidation the latter one was against the phenomenon that ferrate dosage effect was eliminated by a large extent in phosphate buffer therefore fe iv would not be the cause of ferrate dosage effect at ph 7 0 3 2 2 counterbalance of ferrate dosage effect by pyrophosphate if the mechanism proposed above is true the oxidant dosage effect in borate buffer is expected to be counterbalanced with the presence of an appropriate amount of a much stronger ligand like pyrophosphate as shown in figure s5 in the condition of excess ferrate 0 1 mm pyrophosphate greatly inhibited the reaction between ferrate and pmso compared with oxidation kinetics in borate buffer fig 1 a d but was not sufficient to completely diminish the ferrate dosage effect k app 31 1 34 3 43 2 m 1s 1 for 20 30 50 µm ferrate dosage respectively increasing the pyrophosphate concentration to 1 mm the k app values were reduced to a relatively constant level around 30 m 1s 1 for all ferrate dosages of 20 30 50 µm fig 4 a b in the condition of excess pmso fig 4 c d the k app values were also obtained at a similar level around 30 m 1s 1 with the presence of 1 mm pyrophosphate the consistent values 30 m 1s 1 in pyrophosphate buffer prove that the ferrate dosage effect was induced by fe v oxidation which was completely sequestered in 1 mm pyrophosphate buffer at ph 8 0 1 mm pyrophosphate could also diminish the ferrate dosage effect reducing the k app values from 16 1 18 1 and 25 1 m 1s 1 for 20 30 and 50 µm ferrate to a consistent value around 9 m 1s 1 figure s6 compared with that at ph 7 0 the reaction was much slower and the ferrate dosage effect was also much weaker at ph 8 0 the results above could be rationalized by the fact that ferrate self decomposition is faster at lower ph which favors the generation of fe v species from ferrate self decomposition and thus the pmso oxidation lee et al 2014 besides the fe v reactivity was also dependent on solution ph which was reported to be more reactive at lower ph sharma and o connor 2000 sharma 2002 sharma et al 2004 therefore the ferrate dosage effect is more prominent at lower ph 3 3 mechanistic kinetic modeling 3 3 1 model development based on the experimental results and analyses above a kinetic model involving the ferrate self decomposition pmso oxidation by fe vi fe v and fe iv species was proposed to simulate the ferrate pmso reaction at ph 7 0 fig 8 and table 1 the kinetics and mechanism of ferrate self decomposition have been investigated in depth recently lee et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 lee et al reported that the self decomposition kinetics of ferrate was second order at ph 7 0 in phosphate buffer lee et al 2014 it started with the rate limiting dimerization of two fe vi species to form a di ferrate vi intermediate which finally hydrolyzed into two fe iv species and h2o2 eq 1 the fe iv species further oxidized h2o2 to o2 producing fe ii as product eq 2 fe ii then reduced fe vi species via one electron transfer generating fe v species and fe iii eq 3 the fe v species then underwent self decomposition reaction including first order reaction and second order reaction both of which generated fe iii and h2o2 as products eq 5 6 both fe vi species and fe v species could also oxidize h2o2 into o2 through a two electron transfer process eq 4 7 jiang reported that the heterogeneous ferrate self decomposition catalyzed by fe iii particles could be described by first order reaction and thus ferrate self decomposition in borate buffer followed mixed first and second order kinetics jiang et al 2015 however we found that the reaction order of ferrate self decomposition was dependent on ph but not on buffer condition si text 3 figure s7 and table s1 in both phosphate buffer and borate buffer a second order kinetics could describe the ferrate decomposition well at ph 6 0 and 7 0 while a first order kinetics fit successfully at ph 9 0 for ph 8 0 a mixed first and second order kinetics has to be used the reaction order of ferrate self decomposition seems related to different ferrate species hfeo4 and feo4 2 of which distribution is ph dependent sharma 2011 but not due to the homogeneous or heterogeneous reaction the recent work on ferrate self decomposition in alkaline condition by luo et al also observed the first order decay of feo4 2 species and demonstrated by density functional theory dft calculation that the feo4 2 species favored unimolecular decay mechanism through water attack wa other than the dimerization through oxo coupling oc luo et al 2020 nevertheless the enhance effect of the fe iii particles on ferrate self decomposition was confirmed here on the basis of the larger rate constant at higher ferrate dosage or with increasing external fe iii dosage in borate buffer figures s8 s9 and table s1 therefore only a second order ferrate self decomposition reaction eq 1 was included in the kinetic model at ph 7 0 the corresponding rate constant k1 in phosphate and pyrophosphate buffer was set as 22 m 1s 1 a value determined from ferrate self decomposition kinetics experiment figures s10 s11 table s1 in borate buffer considering the possible varying heterogeneous fe iii catalytic effect on ferrate self decomposition the rate constant of eq 1 was set as a pending parameter k1 pmso was oxidized to pmso2 by fe vi fe v and fe iv species via two electron transfer mechanism with fe iv fe iii and fe ii as the iron products eq 9 11 the corresponding rate constants are denoted as k2 k3 and k4 respectively all the other rate constants of reactions in table 1 under different buffer conditions were determined estimated based on kinetic information from literatures and more details are provided in si text 4 figures s12 s27 3 3 2 model fitting in pyrophosphate buffer and phosphate buffer as discussed in the above section on buffer effect the fe v oxidation was completely sequestered in pyrophosphate buffer because of strong ligand complexation but it s not clear whether fe iv play a role in the pmso oxidation at ph 7 0 based on the role absence of fe iv in the buffer effect of pmso oxidation it could be deducted that fe iv might either react poorly with pmso or its oxidation was not influenced by ligand presence to gain insight into the role of fe iv in pmso oxidation the mechanistic kinetic model proposed above was used to fit the concentration time profiles of fe vi pmso and pmso2 acquired in pyrophosphate buffer through a global fitting function with multiple data sets of varying ferrate dosages firstly rate constants between pmso and fe vi fe iv species k2 and k4 were set as pending parameters while reaction between fe v and pmso was excluded from the kinetic model for mechanism reduction to run a preliminary model fitting the rate constant of fe vi and pmso was determined to be 25 6 m 1s 1 somewhat close to the experimental determined k app value 30 m 1s 1 in pyrophosphate buffer comparatively an upper limit was derived for the rate constant of fe iv species and pmso k4 1 5 10 2 m 1s 1 instead of a precise value with standard deviation suggesting the reactivity between fe iv and pmso was extremely low at ph 7 0 and the fe iv contribution to pmso oxidation was negligible therefore the role absence of fe iv in buffer effect was likely due to the sluggish fe iv reactivity towards pmso at ph 7 0 rather than the alternative hypothesis that the fe iv oxidation of pmso was impervious to ligand presence this explanation was also in agreement with the reported poor oxidation performance on pmso by fe ii h2o2 bataineh et al 2012 fe ii pds wang et al 2018 dong et al 2020 fe ii pms wang et al 2019b and fe ii paa kim et al 2019 system at circumneutral ph conditions where fe iv species was proposed as the major reactive species in a recent study it s reported that fe iv species did contribute to the pmso oxidation at ph 8 0 in borate buffer zhu et al 2020 contrast to the result at ph 7 0 in this study to further investigate the role of fe iv during ferrate oxidation stoichiometry experiment of ferrate and pmso was conducted at ph ranging from 6 0 to 9 0 in borate buffer as shown in fig 5 the δ pmso2 δ fe vi ratio was determined to be larger than one 1 2 at ph 8 0 and 9 0 proving the fe iv involvement in pmso oxidation at alkaline condition see si text 5 for more details comparatively the molar ratio reduced to around unity at ph 6 0 and 7 0 in agreement with the model fitting result that fe iv reacted sluggishly with pmso at ph 7 0 and thus contributed barely to the pmso oxidation the results above reveals that the role of fe iv species is strongly dependent on solution ph and fe iv might be less reactive at near neutral conditions hence the reaction between fe iv and pmso eq 11 is a redundant step in the kinetic model and could be excluded for mechanism reduction in the following model fitting further the averaged value of k app experimentally obtained in pyrophosphate buffer could be recognized as the specific rate constant k2 of fe vi species with pmso i e k2 30 m 1s 1 with negligible involvement of fe v and fe iv species then the k3 value for fe v and pmso was estimated to be k3 2 5 105 m 1s 1 in pyrophosphate by adopting the above parameter setting through model fitting through the same approach the k3 value was determined to be 1 5 34 106 m 1s 1 in phosphate buffer in agreement with the reported rate constant range of 105 106 m 1s 1 reported for fe v species oxidizing organic compounds including phenol rush et al 1995 amino acid rush and bielski 1995 and carboxylic acid bielski et al 1994 in phosphate buffer from pulse radiolysis studies 3 3 3 model fitting in borate buffer since the ferrate self decomposition was self enhanced with increasing ferrate dosage due to the greater amount of fe iii formed at higher ferrate dosage the k1 value was set as another pending parameter besides k3 considering the fe iii enhanced effect might vary in different conditions unlike the condition of pyrophosphate and phosphate it was unsuccessful to simultaneously fit the multiple data sets of varying ferrate dosages with a global fitting function in borate buffer therefore model fitting was conducted individually at 20 30 and 50 µm ferrate dosage as shown in fig 1 the model fitted all the data sets well and the fitting results were summarized in table 2 the k1 value was determined to be 38 1 43 5 and 82 1 m 1s 1 for ferrate dosage of 20 30 and 50 µm respectively consistent with the increasing trend of decomposition rate constants observed in sole ferrate self decomposition experiments table s1 the k3 value of fe v and pmso was determined to be 1 52 107 m 1s 1 at 20 µm ferrate 6 orders of magnitude higher than that of fe vi species 30 m 1s 1 and only 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding rate constants of sulfate radical 3 17 108 m 1s 1 or hydroxyl radical 3 61 109 m 1s 1 the k3 value increased to 5 11 107 m 1s 1 at 30 µm ferrate and 1 07 108 m 1s 1 at 50 µm ferrate approaching rates of typical radical reaction the very high reactivity of fe v species with pmso corroborated the partial radical character of the oxide ligands bound to fe v rush and bielski 1989 1995 bielski 1992 based on the ferrate dosage effect on k3 values we speculated that the oxidation of pmso by fe v species was also enhanced by the in situ formed fe iii derived from ferrate reduction similar to the ferrate self decomposition eq 1 the enhancement caused by fe iii is a heterogeneous process which would be suppressed by ligand presence as ligand could form complexes with fe iii ions or cover the surfaces of fe iii particles therefore a uniform fitting result could be obtained for varying ferrate dosages in pyrophosphate or phosphate buffer through a global fitting function but not in borate buffer where fe iii particles play an important role in pmso oxidation 3 3 4 enhanced effect of fe iii on fe v oxidation to verify the speculated enhanced effect of fe iii on fe v oxidation of pmso varying dosages of fecl3 were introduced into the system in advance to investigate the effect of external fe iii on the oxidation of pmso by 20 µm ferrate in borate buffer at ph 7 0 as shown in fig 6 the addition of fecl3 significantly accelerated the oxidation of pmso by ferrate the apparent second order rate constants k app were determined to be 2 5 102 3 7 102 and 5 1 102 m 1s 1 for the fecl3 dosage of 5 20 and 50 µm respectively these values were larger by factors of 1 92 2 85 and 3 92 respectively than the corresponding k app value of single ferrate dose besides the addition of fecl3 show no influence on the pmso oxidation in phosphate buffer data not shown confirming the phosphate retardation on the fe iii enhancement proposed above the specific effect of external fe iii on fe vi species oxidation was also investigated by monitoring the fe vi decay under varying dosages of excess pmso fig 3 shows that the k app remain consistent around 40 m 1s 1 in borate buffer with or without external fe iii present indicating that the specific fe vi oxidation was not influenced by fe iii since the role of fe iv was excluded in pmso oxidation at ph 7 0 in both borate and phosphate buffer the fe iii enhancement mechanism was likely related to fe v oxidation fe v species was generated from the serial reactions of ferrate self decomposition the presence of fe iii might promote the fe v generation from ferrate decomposition due to its catalytic effect on ferrate self decomposition jiang et al 2015 in this sense the decrease of fe vi exposure would result in a corresponding increase of fe v exposure as fe vi species transformed into fe v species during the ferrate decomposition and thus enhance the pmso oxidation by fe v oxidation fig 5 c shows that ferrate decomposed faster as the external fe iii dosage increased at reaction time of 10 min the fe vi exposure decreased from 6 04 to 3 57 mm s as the fe iii dosage increased from 0 to 50 µm in theory the fe v exposure would correspondingly increase by 1 69 times at most however the pmso oxidation performance in terms of ln pmso pmso 0 increased by 2 16 times higher than the corresponding theoretical fe v exposure augmentation factor these results suggest that the reactivity of fe v with pmso was also enhanced by fe iii which accord precisely with the increasing k3 value at higher ferrate dosage derived from model fitting in borate buffer table 2 when the external fe iii was prepared from ferrate self decomposition an oxidation enhancement with increasing fe vi origin fe iii dosage was also observed figure s28 revealing the self enhanced nature of ferrate pmso oxidation process 3 3 5 model validation and relative contribution of fe vi and fe v species the rate constants derived from the data fitting in the condition of excess ferrate table 2 was used to predict the kinetic data of excess pmso by model simulation as shown in figs 2 and 4 c the model successfully predicted the kinetic curves of pmso and pmso2 of varying ferrate dosages under excess pmso in all buffer conditions validating the model proposed above is robust and reasonable the k app value experimentally determined by monitoring the fe vi decay under varying dosage of excess pmso 40 m 1s 1 turned out to be a little higher than the k app value determined under excess ferrate in pyrophosphate buffer 30 m 1s 1 which was recognized as the true rate constant between fe vi species and pmso at ph 7 0 this mismatch appears to be unexpected since the k app value was determined in the condition where ferrate self decomposition was minimized and was also expected to reflect the true rate constant between fe vi and pmso the kinetic model in table 1 was utilized to simulate the reaction of ferrate with varying dosage of excess pmso interestingly model simulation also yields a k app value of around 40 m 1s 1 fig 3c in the ferrate pmso system fe vi was consumed by fe vi self decomposition eq 1 and reaction with fe ii eq 3 h2o2 eq 4 pmso eq 11 model simulation shows that in the excess of pmso the contributions of fe vi self decomposition and reaction with h2o2 were negligible 2 and 0 while reactions with fe ii and pmso were the major contributors 29 and 69 that is to say about 69 of the k app determined by monitoring the fe vi decay under excess pmso reflect the true rate constant between fe vi and pmso 69 40 27 6 m 1s 1 exactly close to the 30 m 1s 1 determined in pyrophosphate buffer although the fe ii concentration in ferrate pmso system was quite low 1 5 10 9 m the reaction between fe ii and fe vi was extremely fast 1 107 m 1s 1 lee et al 2014 and thus contribute fairly to the fe vi consumption even under excess pmso the contribution ratios of fe vi and fe v species on the pmso oxidation under various conditions were calculated and shown in fig 7 see si text s6 for calculation details in the condition of excess ferrate the contribution of fe v species to the total pmso oxidation in borate buffer was determined to be 73 90 and 98 at the ferrate dosage of 20 30 and 50 µm respectively this result reveals that fe v was the prevailing active species when excess ferrate oxidized pmso in borate buffer at ph 7 0 and its dominant role was enhanced at higher ferrate dosage on one hand higher ferrate dosage would increase the competitiveness of fe vi self decomposition pathway eq 1 over the direct fe vi pmso oxidation pathway eq 9 producing a greater amount of fe v species and leading to a higher fe v exposure on the other hand more fe iii generated from ferrate reduction would also be beneficial for the fe v oxidative reactivity through heterogeneous enhancement in phosphate buffer the corresponding contributions of fe v species reduced to 17 20 and 30 respectively where fe vi species predominated the pmso oxidation in turn in pyrophosphate buffer the contribution of fe vi species increased to around 99 at 20 30 50 µm ferrate dosage whereas fe v species contributed negligibly as the condition switched from excess ferrate to excess pmso the corresponding fe v contributions decreased in all buffer conditions for example the fe v contributions decreased from 73 90 and 98 to 40 47 and 66 in borate buffer for ferrate dosages of 20 30 and 50 µm this decreasing trend of fe v contribution was in agreement with the decreasing k app values and diminishing ferrate dosage effect from excess ferrate to excess pmso overall the above results were consistent with the dosage effect and buffer effect on the k app variation observed in the kinetic experiments a higher k app value at raised ferrate dosage or weaker ligand presence was clearly corresponded to a higher fe v contribution 3 4 practical application the ferrate self decomposition used to be considered as an undesirable reaction which would consume significant amount of ferrate and potentially decrease the oxidation efficiency for micropollutants abatement taking pmso as a model organic compound this study reveals that without the presence of strong ligands the oxidation of target compounds was mainly achieved by fe v species generated from ferrate self decomposition especially at relative high ferrate dosage or with fe iii promotion therefore ferrate self decomposition is not just a self degradation but also a self activation process during which fe vi species is transformed into the more reactive fe v species for oxidation in this regard accelerating the ferrate self decomposition could be used to enhance the ferrate oxidation of micropollutants introducing external fe iii e g dosing fecl3 could promote the fe v species generation from ferrate self decomposition for pmso oxidation more importantly the heterogeneous fe iii enhancement on fe v oxidation improved the competitiveness of fe v oxidation pathway over fe v auto decomposition and thus elevated the utilization efficiency of ferrate oxidation capacity reducing the ferrate dosage required the addition of external fecl3 was proved to be able to enhance the ferrate oxidation of micropollutants like smx over a wide ph range figure s29 the in situ formed fe iii particles in ferrate reaction are reported to be composed of both amorphous and crystalline fe iii lv et al 2018 whereas the fe iii particles derived from direct fe iii hydrolysis is amorphous ching et al 1994 duan and gregory 2003 implying that the amorphous part of fe iii particles play the simulative role nevertheless whether the crystal form of fe iii oxides and other transition metal oxides could also catalyze the ferrate oxidation as well as the influence of other characteristics like particle size and morphology deserves further investigation during the ferrate oxidation of micropollutants like cbz and dcf figure s30 apparent ferrate dosage effect was also observed in borate buffer which was then counterbalanced in pyrophosphate similar to ferrate oxidation of pmso it s very likely that fe v derived from ferrate self decomposition contributed to the micropollutants oxidation and partly caused the ferrate dosage effect and buffer effect ferrate dosage effect on cbz oxidation was also observed in river water matrix doc 17 0 0 5 mgc l figure s31 revealing that the ferrate dosage effect as well as the ferrate self activation process was also present in actual water samples the k app values in borate buffered river water samples were lower than the corresponding values in borate buffered pure water samples this might be ascribed to the following two reasons 1 the complexing components of natural organic matters nom would inhibit the ferrate oxidation via complexing intermediate iron species adusei gyamfi et al 2019 2 the reductive components of nom would competitively consume the active intermediate iron species kappler and haderlein 2003 as a highly reactive and unstable species the oxidation reactivity of fe iv species was reported to be lower than that of fe v species sharma 2011 sharma 2013 in this study the rate constant of fe iv with pmso at ph 7 0 was found 1 5 10 2 m 1s 1 and fe iv contributed negligibly to the pmso oxidation however the reactivity of fe iv with other micropollutants remains unknown it is still unable to confirm or negate the role of fe iv during the ferrate oxidation of micropollutants getting knowledge of the ligand effect on fe iv oxidation could help us to further distinguish the relative contributions of fe vi fe v fe iv during the ferrate oxidation of micropollutants and facilitate our understanding of ferrate chemistry 4 conclusions the oxidant dosage effect on ferrate oxidation of pmso higher k app values at higher ferrate dosage could be counterbalanced by pyrophosphate addition similar phenomena were observed for ferrate oxidation of micropollutants like cbz and dcf the fe v species derived from ferrate self decomposition was responsible for the ferrate dosage effect and was the major oxidant during ferrate oxidation of pmso therefore ferrate self decomposition was also a self activation process forming fe v species to oxidize target compounds fe vi oxidation was impervious to phosphate while fe v oxidation was strongly suppressed by phosphate complexation the in situ formed fe iii or external fe iii was found to enhance the ferrate oxidation of pmso by promoting the fe v oxidation declaration of competing interest the authors

17044,the construction of rural wastewater treatment plants rwtps is an effective initiative to achieve sustainable water resources especially in the rural areas situated upstream of the dams where water and waste substances produced by villages are discharged into the wastewater behind the dams neither is the initiative feasible to be launched without the partnership of local people for this reason we gained insights into the determinants of villagers desire and intention to have a share in the construction and management of rwtps and determined the best place to locate the rwtps using fuzzy catastrophe scheme fcs the study benefited from the survey of 180 rural people from two villages situated upstream of alavian dam maragheh township northwestern iran using the theory of goal directed behavior tgdb and rational choice theory rct we designed a questionnaire inclusive of the constructs relevant to the hypothetical relationships the cronbach s alpha method and discriminant analysis were used to make sure that indicator variables were consistently loaded with pertinent latent variables the results of pls sem manifested a proper fitted model with the data as would be hypothesized attitude towards participation pbc positive emotions had a positive impact on desire which directly influences the intention to participate in the construction and management of rwtps to locate rwtps as geographically and spatially as possible we made use of suitability index si formulated by the fcs the resulting evidence demonstrated that the spatial distribution of si would be classified into five bands using jenks optimization method northwestern areas located in bands 1 and 2 were appropriate areas whereas western and northwestern areas in bands 4 5 were caught sight of being not appropriate areas the implications delivered in conclusion would be useful for the same cases in other parts of the world and further to stimulate rural people to participate in the construction of rwtps and locate the best area for setting up the plants keywords partnership construction wastewater treatment suitability index 1 introduction the treatment of wastewater and sewage before being carried away and pumped into the water resources is a remarkable measure to achieve sustainable water resources management this issue is of vital importance especially in rural areas where rural wastewater is discharged into the dams resulting in the spread of pollutants into the water resources provided for citizens in the urban areas wu et al 2011 abadi and shahvali 2020 thus it is possible to provide hygienic water resources by the construction of collecting wastewater and treatment networks in urban and rural areas jazayeri et al 2010 wu et al 2011 allowing wastewater not being entered into the water resources the collaboration of local people with specialists in the scheme of on site wastewater treatment and sewerage networks makes possible the combination of local knowledge with modern knowledge necessary to planning designing constructing and maintaining the subsequent managerial tasks in the long term us environmental protection agency 2002 lahijanian and mohamadi 2016 social psychologists set a high value on partnership a remarkable social and cultural indicator in the discussion of assessment and comparison of water and wastewater systems prouty et al 2017 a dramatic shift in development literature indicates that centralized and hierarchical governments should work with local government or non governmental organizations azizi khalkheili and zamani 2009 yazdanpanah et al 2013 public participation is an indicator that should be investigated to ensure that rural development has been achieved atmiş et al 2007 therefore by participating of local people in collective projects and working with local governments it would provide the two sides with well modified public goods provision kvartiuk and curtiss 2019 the convincing witnesses are available in the literature referring to the impact of partnership for example in irrigation network management in rural areas azizi khalkheili and zamani 2009 in latrine designing wilbur 2014 rodgers et al 2007 in sewage networks zhang et al 2020 and being involved in water treatment behavior to produce gray water wang and lin 2020 oteng peprah et al 2020 however there is not enough evidence of rural people s partnership in the construction and management of rwtps in iran and worldwide with respect to the gaps of attitude desire intention this study therefore included rural people perceptions with a view to examining the factors contributing to the involvement in the construction and management of rwtps in the rural areas situated upstream of alavian dam maragheh township northwestern iran the following objectives were also addressed 1 to investigate desire and intention to join in the construction and management of rwtps 2 to examine the direct and indirect relations of exogenous variables of pls sem with the desire and intention to participate in the construction and management of rwtps and 3 to determine the optimized location of constructing rwtps using fuzzy catastrophe scheme fcs 2 literature review 2 1 theory of goal directed behavior tgdb the tgdb is an extended form of the ajzen s theory of planned behavior tpb the constructs such as past behavior and negative positive emotions have been added to the original model desire is an intermediate variable between exogenous variables attitude behavioral control subjective norms and endogenous variables intention behavior richetin et al 2010 2 1 1 hypothesis 1 the effect of attitude towards participation on desire by definition an attitude towards a behavior is defined as to the degree to which an individual has a favorable unfavorable assessment of performing a specific behavior ajzen 1999 attitudes are perceived as influential factors in adopting wastewater technologies and wastewater treatment technologies madden et al cited in prouty et al 2018 oteng peprah et al 2020 flannery and may 2000 examined a diversity of effects of environmental decision making intentions on hazardous wastewater treatment operations and manifested that attitudes significantly influence decision making intentions abdelradi et al 2017 have supported the claim that the more respondents have positive attitudes towards treating wastewater the more they are eager to have positive behavioral intentions to use treated water to meet inedible needs associated with the participation of households in the household hazardous waste hhw collection program cabaniss 2014 states that attitude towards hhw collection participation affects intention to take part in the hhw collection program to seek the drivers of wastewater treatment behavior wang and lin 2020 surveyed 230 taiwanese swine farmers and provided evidence that attitude towards swine wastewater treatment has a positive effect on the intention to perform wastewater treatment behavior 2 1 2 hypothesis 2 the effect of subjective norms sns on desire as called by ajzen 1991 an individual is likely to undertake a behavior when he she receives the encouraging and inspiring messages that are conveyed from other people such as friends family and colleagues in the context of wastewater treatment flannery and may 2000 concluded that sns have a significant impact on environmental decision making intentions regarding hazardous wastewater treatment operations the positive hypothetical relationship of sns and behavioral intention has been documented in the study done by abdelradi et al 2017 when an individual faces with the opinion of other people an increase occurs in the likelihood that he she forms positive behavioral intention to use purified water to meet inedible needs cabaniss 2014 investigated citizens involvement in the hhw program in middlesex county in southeastern connecticut us and demonstrated that sns contribute to shaping the intention to join in the hhw collection program to investigate households tendency to accept greywater treatment technologies oteng peprah et al 2020 derived the conclusion that sns impinge upon the adoption of greywater treatment technologies 2 1 3 hypothesis 3 the effect of perceived behavioral control pbc on desire pbc is a non volitional characteristic in nature conceptually defined as individuals confidence or abilities to perform a specific behavior an imperative determinant of behavioral intention song et al 2012 the literature provides evidence that the more people have pbc the more they have favorable intention to perform wastewater treatment behavior wang and lin 2020 and make use of purified water to meet inedible needs abdelradi et al 2017 studies also indicate that people become eager to embrace wastewater technologies and technologies applied in treating greywater as they acquire enough pbc increases oteng peprah et al 2020 madden et al cited in prouty et al 2018 the finding of the study carried out by cabaniss 2014 is also indicative of being a causal relation between pbc and intention to become involved in an hhw collection program part of pbc is financial strength imputed in whole or in part to revenues gained from income sources through which people allocate funds to environmental initiatives the study showed that individuals with higher income resources have more willing to accept the urinary tract toilet system wangui 2016 contrary to these results flannery and may 2000 conclude that pbc has no bearing on environmental decision making intentions regarding hazardous wastewater treatment operations 2 1 4 hypothesis 4 the effect of desire on the intention the intention is a mental and subjective driven preparedness that direct people to take an action with more coherent and stable entity in comparison to desire in turn desire is tendency in moment based on wishing wanting yearning and hankering which is probably less stable compared to intention the desire of villagers in an antecedent to generate the intention to become involved in the management and construction of rwtps desire functions as a motive that lies in the mind influencing intention for the desire to be stimulated a person needs a suitable context therefore desire alone is not enough to perform a voluntary action sometimes one imagines an action and at first acknowledges the usefulness of doing it but as soon as he compares it with other voluntary actions he stops doing it according to the gdbt desire affects intention directly and impinges upon the main behavior indirectly by the mediation of intention richetin et al 2010 2 1 5 hypothesis 5 and 6 the effect of positive negative on desire pe ne based on the tgdb positive emotion has a positive influence on the desire and intention of the main behavior whereas negative emotion influences desire and intention negatively richetin et al 2010 hypothesis 1 attitude has a positive effect on desire hypothesis 2 sns have a positive effect on desire hypothesis 3 pbc has a positive impact on desire hypothesis 4 the desire has a positive impact on intention hypothesis 5 perceived positive emotion is positively associated with the desire hypothesis 6 perceived negative emotion is natively associated with the desire 2 2 rational choice theory rct the reason for adding rct constructs to the original model is due to the nature of the research problem and the specific context in which it is being investigated many development projects carried out in iran are imputed to the fact that the government should be in charge of project planning implementing and evaluating this is true for example in water resources management see yazdanpanah et al 2013 this viewpoint is considered true by the specialists or outsiders and by the locals or insiders while more attention is being paid to governance today than centralized and hierarchical government assuming that local people with government authorities are in charge of constructing and implementing the managerial tasks of the rwtps hypothetically it was intended to know that how local people would need to and want to benefit from the project of rwtps as a result rct constructs were used in practice the iranian energy optimization desk for is responsible for planning executing and evaluating the project of rwtps which is a government owned structure therefore it was remarkable to consider a hypothesis with the content of benefit cost in order to investigate its effect on desire and behavioral intention 2 2 1 hypothesis 7 and 8 the effect of perceived benefits costs on desire by drawing on a representative survey of respondents in senegal gaye and diallo 1997 show that the consequences of the construction of suitable and inexpensive infrastructure for home treatment plants include job creation for people moneymaking and a civic sense that would come with citizens lahijanian and mohamadi 2016 report a motive for the citizens to participate in implementing the sewerage project pertains to benefits that they reap such as maintaining the health of citizens protecting the environment reducing wastewater disposal problems providing social welfare and achieving economic efficiency respectively in the study performed by devi 2009 it was found that absolute and the relative costs of wastewater treatment compared to other options to water sources have significant limitations in wastewater treatment in developing countries the high costs of maintenance in one hand and the operation of sewage facilities in second hand have made it necessary to pay attention to the various dimensions of sewage projects dmw abfa 2012 notwithstanding financial costs account for the ethical decision making intention of wastewater treatment significantly flannery and may 2000 studied citizens partnership in the implementation and operation of sewerage projects lahijanian and mohamadi 2016 provided evidence that social costs make a stand against the public acceptance and therefore participation in sewerage projects 2 3 constructs added to the original theories 2 3 1 hypothesis 9 the effect of sympathy on desire sympathy is a noteworthy component in the discussion of social life and citizenship that leads to the cohesion of communities sympathized people probably think of the favorable unfavorable consequences of their actions received by others and this in itself can be a stimulator or deterrent of taking an action in developing countries part of less attention to environmental conservation by people devi 2009 derives from the fact that people have no sympathy for others 2 3 2 hypothesis 10 the effect of attitude towards water and wastewater authorities on the desire the poor organizational performance around wastewater systems in developing countries hinders wastewater treatment while in developed countries institutional and legal arrangements for wastewater treatment are stimulators to strongly initialize the wastewater treatment and recycling policies devi 2009 according to lahijanian and mohamadi 2016 citizens dissatisfaction with the performance of the water and sewerage company wsc preclude citizens participation in the wastewater collection program hypothesis 7 perceived benefits have a positive impact on desire hypothesis 8 perceived costs have a negative impact on desire hypothesis 9 sympathy has a positive impact on desire hypothesis 10 villagers views on water and wastewater official authorities have a positive effect on desire 3 materials and methods 3 1 research site this cross sectional study was conducted from 28 may 2020 to 14 september 2020 in the two villages upstream of alavian dam in maragheh township azerbaijan sharqi iran including ghishlaq and tazeh kand see fig 1 a the reason for selecting the two sites is that these villages carry village wastewater away discharged into the water stored behind the dam alavian dam lies 3 km away from maragheh township in the north with the water capacity of 120 million cubic meters built across the sufi chai river to provide drinking water to the townships of maragheh miandoab bonab ajab shir and malekan 3 2 sample the local people of the two villages of ghishlaq and tazeh kand constituted the study population n 806 given the number of people above 18 aged in the research population and the margin of error equaling 5 confidence 95 in accordance with the krejcie morgan s sample size table we selected respondents randomly obtained a total of 210 questionnaires of which 180 questionnaires entailed valid and complete information with a rate of valid recovery of 85 71 3 3 operational definitions of variables reliability and validity the two kinds of questions were included in the questionnaire 1 perceived questions items that are related to the constructs of theoretical framework measured by a 5 point likert scale from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree and 2 factual questions the subsequent sections of the article would display the items by which the concepts of the theoretical model were measured the cronbach s alpha method and composite reliability cr were used to assess the consistency of indicator variables with the latent variables carried out on the platform of smartpls3 2 9 software https www smartpls com 3 4 protocol to find the best location of rwtps the suitability index si was developed to determine the best location of constructing rwtps by formulating fcs which incorporates a set of data layers entailing both technical and social datasets the fcs is a multi criteria decision making technique that integrates fuzzy membership function fmf from the fuzzy theory zadeh 1965 with catastrophe functions from catastrophe theory thom 1987 we elaborate on data layers and fcs as follows 1 topography t is obtained by aster digital elevation model dem with 12 5 m resolution see fig 2 b which renders 1282 pixels this resolution is the same for other layers 2 distance from the river d is provided with identifying river path from dem and using the euclidian distance toolbox in a gis processing software see fig 2c the proximity of the treatment plant to the river is a threat to its operation and therefore the distance from the river has an indirect proportionality with si 3 land use l is prepared by using the sentinel 2 image satellite and normalized difference vegetation index after applying atmospheric and geometric corrections and classifying by the maximum likelihood method three land uses are identified i e irrigated barren and built up lands see fig 2d 4 slope s is calculated by using aster dem with a percentage unit see fig 2e this data layer has an indirect proportionality with si the processed data layers are normalized by using triangular fmf concerning direct or indirect proportionality of data layers to si of incorporated data layers the topography and land use are normalized by using eq 1a and the distance from the river and slope data layers are normalized by using eq 1b 1a x norm x x m i n x m a x x m i n 1b x n o r m x m a x x x m a x x m i n where xmax and xmin are maximum and minimum pixel values for a data layer respectively and xnorm is the normalized value of an arbitrary pixel x 4 results 4 1 analysis of participation data 4 1 1 descriptive statistics the average age of the respondents is 39 05 st d 14 71 the majority of respondents are the head of households 152 people 84 4 the rest of the respondents are not inclusive of the household head 26 people 14 4 furthermore the highest frequency of respondents falls into the category of secondary school and high school while the lowest number of respondents is in the college class the average number of labor force above 18 year in the household is 2 53 st d 1 40 the average monthly income of the household is almost 13 465 670 rials table 1 displays the measures of latent variables that were intersected with the levels of descriptive characteristics some of the measures are statistically different at the respective levels 4 1 2 inferential statistics 4 1 2 1 evaluation of reliability and validity of indicator variables to bring surely the relevancy of the questionnaire items as well as the generalizability of the research results the validity of the questionnaire and the reliability of the research indicators was assessed the partial least square pls method was used in addition to the assessment of the reliability indices of cronbach s method the composite reliability cr was also applied allowing us to compare the results of the two reliability indicators the point that should come into view is that the measurements obtained from cronbach s alpha and the cr should be higher than the cutoff measure of 0 70 i e cr and cronbach s alpha 0 70 additionally the convergent validity index was used to evaluate the correlation of inter item of the concepts ave average variance extracted was used to the cutoff limit above 0 50 ave 0 50 cr ave see abadi et al 2020 part of the confirmatory analysis of data includes the fornell larcker method by which it is possible to assess discriminant validity dv reflecting upon the dissimilarity in the measurement of different structures by a measuring instrument see esposito vinzi et al 2010 p 696 an acceptable value for the dv is generated when the between construct correlations are less than the square root of the ave associated with each construct wilson and lankton 2009 p 217 upon the realization of these measurements the validity of the distinction is confirmed the cross loadings analysis cla was carried for the purpose of making sure that an item not being loaded on more than one latent variable based on the results of the above multiplied analyzes i e cronbach s alpha cr ave fornell larcker criterion and cross loadings it was found that the questionnaire is an approval measurement tool for the study see tables 2 and 3 table 4 displays the values of cross loadings these measures show that indicator variables are well loaded on the latent variables which are greater than 0 70 4 1 2 2 assessment of model fit criteria we also investigated the value of standardized root mean square residual srmr an important model fit criterion which is the difference between the observed correlation and the model implied correlation matrix allowing the assessment of the average magnitude of the discrepancies between observed and expected correlations henseler et al 2014 introduce the srmr as a goodness of fit measure for pls sem that can be used to avoid model misspecification https www smartpls com documentation algorithms and techniques model fit as declared by hu and bentler 1999 values less than 0 10 or 0 08 are the best for this model fit index in this study the value of srmr is 0 07 indicating that the model matches with the data well using blindfolding technique the construct cross validated redundancy was estimated a measure of q2 with acceptable value is above 0 30 in this study the values of q2 range from 0 38 to 0 40 approving of fitting and being predictive relevance of the model 4 1 2 3 hypothesis testing before evaluating the path coefficients in the pls sem the two indices vif and tolerance were evaluated therefore the results were with no interference of the collinearity effect see table 5 the resulting evidence provided by carrying out pls sem indicated that attitude towards participation has a positive impact on desire β a t t d e s i r e 0 50 p 0 001 sδ 6 16 thus h1 was authenticated pbc is a driver that contributes to predicting the variance of desire thereby pbc accounts for the desire to participate in constructing and managing the rwtps β p b c d e s i r e 0 41 p 0 001 sδ 3 55 therefore supporting h3 furthermore the highest amount of beta coefficient associated with the path of desire int displays the positive and the strong impact of desire on intention β d e s i r e i n t 0 77 p 0 001 sδ 8 91 confirmed h4 we gained insight into the impact of positive emotion on desire as positive emotion increases it is much likely to constitute the desire to participate in the construction and management of rwtps β p e d e s i r e 0 23 p 0 01 sδ 3 17 therefore such result provides evidence for the confirmation of h5 one shocking result gained in this study was the negative impact of perceived benefits on desire β b n f d e s i r e 0 27 p 0 001 sδ 3 34 also perceived costs negatively contribute to shaping desire thus the hypothesis 7 is not ratified additionally perceived costs are able to predict the variance of desire negatively β c o s t d e s i r e 0 15 p 0 001 sδ 3 38 hence confirming hypothesis h8 see table 6 as shown in table 7 r2 and cohen s d indicate that the conceptual model fits well with data the appropriate value for the r2 and cohen s d is therefore an indication of the appropriate and the real effect of the variables affecting the behavioral intention fig 3 shows the results of running the rct we removed the constructs of rct from the original model and run the model once again the removal of the constructs of tgdb and the desire intention linkage stayed with only the constructs of tgdb by ruing rct it resulted in 0 08 for the value of the srmr when all of the constructs of two models are combined together the best result was obtained i e srmr less 0 08 srmr less 0 076 see fig 4 4 2 analysis of location data the relative priority of data layers and their combination of catastrophe functions were implemented as follows i identifying control parameters of data layers for a data layer the number of control parameter corresponds to the number of classifications which are determined by statistical evaluation e g sadeghfam et al 2016 or expert judgment e g ahmed et al 2016 also the number of control parameters determines the type of catastrophe function table 8 presents different types of catastrophe functions the number of state variables and control parameters ii calculating the dependency of a state variable with control parameters after identifying the control parameters the state variable to a control parameter i e a class of data layer is calculated by using equations in table 8 the priority of data layers to si and can be calculated as per complementary and non complementary principles wang et al 2011 the complementary principle considers the meaning of state variables as the state of a system whereas the non complementary principle considers the minimum of state variables like the state of a system iii calculating si after calculating the priorities of the incorporated data layers as per the complementary principles si is calculated by considering all data layers as control parameters and using the butterfly catastrophe equation notably si has four data layers control parameters then the butterfly catastrophe is selected si is calculated as follows 2 s i l a y e r 1 2 l a y e r 2 3 l a y e r 3 4 l a y e r 4 5 4 where layer1 to layer4 replace respectively layers with minimum to maximum priorities among e d l and s data layers in the formalized form table 9 expounds on fcs to calculate the priorities of data layers to si column 2 represents control parameters or classifications for each data layer which are determined by the jenks optimization method jenks 1967 column 3 shows the mean values for each control parameter column 4 represents the normalization of mean values column 3 concerning direct or indirect proportionality column 5 displays the type of catastrophe functions concerning the number of control parameters column 6 represents state values for each control parameter by using the equations in table 1 column 7 shows the priorities of data layers by using the complementary principle which are the mean values of column 6 as per this column e s l and d data layers have the high to low priorities to si respectively the priorities of data layers were delineated then si was calculated employing the butterfly catastrophe function in eq 2 in which d l s and e data layers are substituted to layer1 to layer4 fig 5 illustrates the spatial distribution of si which was classified into five bands using jenks optimization method colored in green to red representing the appropriate and inappropriate sites to construct rwtps accordingly northwest areas are located in bands 1 and 2 which are appropriate areas referencing to technical and social aspects of incorporating data layers meanwhile west and northwest are located in bands 4 5 characterized by inappropriate areas 5 discussion the result indicates that attitude towards partnership in constructing and managing the rwtps is statistically significant in predicting desire and intention delivering a promising message for initiating and putting the construction of the project into practice the resulting evidence shows that villagers potentially perceive participation as an indispensable reality through which they could reap the fruits of the project consequently their attitudes undertake the formation of the desire and behavioral intention this finding is accounted for by the notion that states that attitudes formed through the calling of the information retrieved from the memory or through online thinking about the participation steer the focus of mind attention towards the favorability of participation therefore thinking processes are stimulated to contribute to shaping the desire and behavioral intention to take part in constructing rwtps this finding is consistent with the findings of oteng peprah et al 2020 flannery and may 2000 abdelradi et al 2017 cabaniss 2014 wang and lin 2020 the result also demonstrates that pbc is a driver playing a role in constituting the desire to participate in rwtps providing evidence that villagers perceived that they have internal competencies and possess facilities to share with the project authorities in constructing the rwtps this issue is especially considerable when the centralized and hierarchical government as the main actor being in charge of implementing the project concludes that successfully initiating the project will be achieved if the government agents work and are accompanied by the local people this condition makes it easier to put the construction of rwtps into practice as efficiently as possible even after the construction of the project the local people will be needed to be recruited in order to manage the activities of rwtps in general a higher level of pbc will give insiders the freedom and authority to play a more active role in building the project the positive effect of pbc on the desire has been documented by previous studies for instance wang and lin 2020 abdelradi et al 2017 oteng peprah et al 2020 madden et al cited in prouty et al 2018 cabaniss 2014 wangui 2016 it was found that desire plays a leading role in shaping the intention to join in the construction of rwtps villagers desire is of course aroused by receiving the sensory data obtained from online visiting of successful projects of rwtps or from viewing pictures and reading about the successful projects even desire is stimulated by sharing the subject of the construction of rwtps by experts with villagers which is an influential way to constitute their minds particularly with those who have never had a mental background and experience of being exposed to such issue this finding is in harmony with the finding of the study conducted by richetin et al 2010 the effect of positive emotions on desire is also positively significant emotion is more extractable and objective in terms of expression of the human brain system than mentality in this case the enthusiasm of the villagers could play a role in constituting the desire and behavioral intention the function of the concept of desire would be imperative especially in the latest completing phases of the construction of the rwtps this finding is upheld by richetin et al 2010 the study disclosed the negative effect of perceived benefits on desire this result would probably go back to the survey time in essence the benefits of an object are perceived in both objective and subjective ways the former is achieved when a person would have experienced seen worked and observed the benefits of collaborating in taking an action in this case participation in the construction of rwtps allegedly objective and experienced benefits the latter returns to a state that a person is asked to comment on the benefits of an object that he has never experienced seen worked and observed which is generally a new object for the person i e perceived benefits therefore according to this result it seems that the nature of measuring the construct has been of the second type furthermore the lower the costs of participating in the project especially financial expenses the greater the willingness and intention is developed this finding is in compliance with flannery and may 2000 and lahijanian and mohamadi 2016 the gis based decision support systems dsss like site selection are faced with subjectivities regarding the quantification of data layers and calculation of a related index the subjectivity with index calculation can be reduced by methods such as the fuzzy catastrophe scheme unlike methods based on expert judgment such as the analytical hierarchy process forman and gass 2001 furthermore the study aims to reduce the subjectivity with the quantification of data layers by integrating the dds model with the socio cognitive model to the best of the authors knowledge this is a first attempt which is carried out by quantifying the land use data layer using questionnaire data furthermore a research driven program in partnership with the university of maragheh and institute of water and energy by sharif university for constructing a rwtp revealed the necessity of the integration of the social cognitive model and the gis based model however there is a room for extending the integration in the future research for various case studies 6 conclusions and management implications this study addressed the two objectives of investigating villagers desire and intention to participate in constructing and managing rwtps and finding the best place to locate the rwtps the attitude is one of the influential constructs shaping desire and behavioral intention the change agents of the water and sewage department need to deliver a detailed description of the desirableness of participating in the project to villagers attainable through individual and collective training methods besides these agents are suggested to give insights to rural people about participation in constructing and managing the rwtps by programs broadcasted by mass media which play a substantial role in forming favorable attitudes respondents also indicated that they have the perceived ability to participate in constructing and managing rwtps a promising finding for policy makers to initiate maintain and put the construction of the project into practice the perceived ability includes intrinsic effort based personality internalized capabilities acquired by informal formal education and accessible environmental facilities in this case most of the respondents have a high regard for their internal abilities to cooperate in turn the respondents stand against participation through paying for the financial expenses of the project in the same vein the negative impact of perceived costs shows that the respondents are not able to pay for part of the costs of constructing the project because of being included in low income families therefore it is recommended to employ local people as the labor to construct the project even young people should be recruited to handle the managerial activities of rwtps desire also has a strong influence on intention officials and experts of the water and sewage department are recommended to broadcast extension films in local meetings about other cases that were successful in stimulating rural communities to construct the rwtps furthermore tours should be provided so that informant villagers visit the successful and pioneer sewage treatment sites in other provinces or regions to convey their experiences to the target communities even the broadcast of news of rwtps by local radio programs may serve to shape the desire and behavioral intention given the effect of positive emotion on desire it is suggested by conducting qualitative exploratory research methods to identify the villagers who have a great passion and enthusiasm for the advancement of their villages these people could be designated to be the local leaders of the project because their passion and enthusiasm lead them to stay with other local people in one hand and with the officials and experts of the water and sewage department on the other hand the research was exposed to three limitations first some of the respondents were not familiar with the construction and management of rwtps they found it hard to understand the second limitation includes the differentiation of three concepts of attitude desire and intention by respondents attitude can be distinguished from the two constructs of intention and desire due to the nature of desirability and undesirability the problem remains with the separation of the two constructs of desire and intention theoretically we believe that behavioral intention is more stable than desire desire is rooted in feeling and excitement stances which makes it flexible as one becomes aroused and gets emotional for example by coming cross a stimulating phenomenon communicating with a person with specific charisma or seeing an object already wished to have third the generalization of the results to other cases should proceed with caution it is suggested to conduct more research on the decision making process of involving the local people in the management of rwtps after completing the construction of the project and its initiation further research is needed to investigate the perceived benefits of the villagers about participating in the managerial affairs of the rwtps declaration of competing interest none acknowlegement this paper has been extracted from the research project grant no 98 d 5712 financially supported by the deputy of education and research university of maragheh hereby the authors are grateful for their supports 
17044,the construction of rural wastewater treatment plants rwtps is an effective initiative to achieve sustainable water resources especially in the rural areas situated upstream of the dams where water and waste substances produced by villages are discharged into the wastewater behind the dams neither is the initiative feasible to be launched without the partnership of local people for this reason we gained insights into the determinants of villagers desire and intention to have a share in the construction and management of rwtps and determined the best place to locate the rwtps using fuzzy catastrophe scheme fcs the study benefited from the survey of 180 rural people from two villages situated upstream of alavian dam maragheh township northwestern iran using the theory of goal directed behavior tgdb and rational choice theory rct we designed a questionnaire inclusive of the constructs relevant to the hypothetical relationships the cronbach s alpha method and discriminant analysis were used to make sure that indicator variables were consistently loaded with pertinent latent variables the results of pls sem manifested a proper fitted model with the data as would be hypothesized attitude towards participation pbc positive emotions had a positive impact on desire which directly influences the intention to participate in the construction and management of rwtps to locate rwtps as geographically and spatially as possible we made use of suitability index si formulated by the fcs the resulting evidence demonstrated that the spatial distribution of si would be classified into five bands using jenks optimization method northwestern areas located in bands 1 and 2 were appropriate areas whereas western and northwestern areas in bands 4 5 were caught sight of being not appropriate areas the implications delivered in conclusion would be useful for the same cases in other parts of the world and further to stimulate rural people to participate in the construction of rwtps and locate the best area for setting up the plants keywords partnership construction wastewater treatment suitability index 1 introduction the treatment of wastewater and sewage before being carried away and pumped into the water resources is a remarkable measure to achieve sustainable water resources management this issue is of vital importance especially in rural areas where rural wastewater is discharged into the dams resulting in the spread of pollutants into the water resources provided for citizens in the urban areas wu et al 2011 abadi and shahvali 2020 thus it is possible to provide hygienic water resources by the construction of collecting wastewater and treatment networks in urban and rural areas jazayeri et al 2010 wu et al 2011 allowing wastewater not being entered into the water resources the collaboration of local people with specialists in the scheme of on site wastewater treatment and sewerage networks makes possible the combination of local knowledge with modern knowledge necessary to planning designing constructing and maintaining the subsequent managerial tasks in the long term us environmental protection agency 2002 lahijanian and mohamadi 2016 social psychologists set a high value on partnership a remarkable social and cultural indicator in the discussion of assessment and comparison of water and wastewater systems prouty et al 2017 a dramatic shift in development literature indicates that centralized and hierarchical governments should work with local government or non governmental organizations azizi khalkheili and zamani 2009 yazdanpanah et al 2013 public participation is an indicator that should be investigated to ensure that rural development has been achieved atmiş et al 2007 therefore by participating of local people in collective projects and working with local governments it would provide the two sides with well modified public goods provision kvartiuk and curtiss 2019 the convincing witnesses are available in the literature referring to the impact of partnership for example in irrigation network management in rural areas azizi khalkheili and zamani 2009 in latrine designing wilbur 2014 rodgers et al 2007 in sewage networks zhang et al 2020 and being involved in water treatment behavior to produce gray water wang and lin 2020 oteng peprah et al 2020 however there is not enough evidence of rural people s partnership in the construction and management of rwtps in iran and worldwide with respect to the gaps of attitude desire intention this study therefore included rural people perceptions with a view to examining the factors contributing to the involvement in the construction and management of rwtps in the rural areas situated upstream of alavian dam maragheh township northwestern iran the following objectives were also addressed 1 to investigate desire and intention to join in the construction and management of rwtps 2 to examine the direct and indirect relations of exogenous variables of pls sem with the desire and intention to participate in the construction and management of rwtps and 3 to determine the optimized location of constructing rwtps using fuzzy catastrophe scheme fcs 2 literature review 2 1 theory of goal directed behavior tgdb the tgdb is an extended form of the ajzen s theory of planned behavior tpb the constructs such as past behavior and negative positive emotions have been added to the original model desire is an intermediate variable between exogenous variables attitude behavioral control subjective norms and endogenous variables intention behavior richetin et al 2010 2 1 1 hypothesis 1 the effect of attitude towards participation on desire by definition an attitude towards a behavior is defined as to the degree to which an individual has a favorable unfavorable assessment of performing a specific behavior ajzen 1999 attitudes are perceived as influential factors in adopting wastewater technologies and wastewater treatment technologies madden et al cited in prouty et al 2018 oteng peprah et al 2020 flannery and may 2000 examined a diversity of effects of environmental decision making intentions on hazardous wastewater treatment operations and manifested that attitudes significantly influence decision making intentions abdelradi et al 2017 have supported the claim that the more respondents have positive attitudes towards treating wastewater the more they are eager to have positive behavioral intentions to use treated water to meet inedible needs associated with the participation of households in the household hazardous waste hhw collection program cabaniss 2014 states that attitude towards hhw collection participation affects intention to take part in the hhw collection program to seek the drivers of wastewater treatment behavior wang and lin 2020 surveyed 230 taiwanese swine farmers and provided evidence that attitude towards swine wastewater treatment has a positive effect on the intention to perform wastewater treatment behavior 2 1 2 hypothesis 2 the effect of subjective norms sns on desire as called by ajzen 1991 an individual is likely to undertake a behavior when he she receives the encouraging and inspiring messages that are conveyed from other people such as friends family and colleagues in the context of wastewater treatment flannery and may 2000 concluded that sns have a significant impact on environmental decision making intentions regarding hazardous wastewater treatment operations the positive hypothetical relationship of sns and behavioral intention has been documented in the study done by abdelradi et al 2017 when an individual faces with the opinion of other people an increase occurs in the likelihood that he she forms positive behavioral intention to use purified water to meet inedible needs cabaniss 2014 investigated citizens involvement in the hhw program in middlesex county in southeastern connecticut us and demonstrated that sns contribute to shaping the intention to join in the hhw collection program to investigate households tendency to accept greywater treatment technologies oteng peprah et al 2020 derived the conclusion that sns impinge upon the adoption of greywater treatment technologies 2 1 3 hypothesis 3 the effect of perceived behavioral control pbc on desire pbc is a non volitional characteristic in nature conceptually defined as individuals confidence or abilities to perform a specific behavior an imperative determinant of behavioral intention song et al 2012 the literature provides evidence that the more people have pbc the more they have favorable intention to perform wastewater treatment behavior wang and lin 2020 and make use of purified water to meet inedible needs abdelradi et al 2017 studies also indicate that people become eager to embrace wastewater technologies and technologies applied in treating greywater as they acquire enough pbc increases oteng peprah et al 2020 madden et al cited in prouty et al 2018 the finding of the study carried out by cabaniss 2014 is also indicative of being a causal relation between pbc and intention to become involved in an hhw collection program part of pbc is financial strength imputed in whole or in part to revenues gained from income sources through which people allocate funds to environmental initiatives the study showed that individuals with higher income resources have more willing to accept the urinary tract toilet system wangui 2016 contrary to these results flannery and may 2000 conclude that pbc has no bearing on environmental decision making intentions regarding hazardous wastewater treatment operations 2 1 4 hypothesis 4 the effect of desire on the intention the intention is a mental and subjective driven preparedness that direct people to take an action with more coherent and stable entity in comparison to desire in turn desire is tendency in moment based on wishing wanting yearning and hankering which is probably less stable compared to intention the desire of villagers in an antecedent to generate the intention to become involved in the management and construction of rwtps desire functions as a motive that lies in the mind influencing intention for the desire to be stimulated a person needs a suitable context therefore desire alone is not enough to perform a voluntary action sometimes one imagines an action and at first acknowledges the usefulness of doing it but as soon as he compares it with other voluntary actions he stops doing it according to the gdbt desire affects intention directly and impinges upon the main behavior indirectly by the mediation of intention richetin et al 2010 2 1 5 hypothesis 5 and 6 the effect of positive negative on desire pe ne based on the tgdb positive emotion has a positive influence on the desire and intention of the main behavior whereas negative emotion influences desire and intention negatively richetin et al 2010 hypothesis 1 attitude has a positive effect on desire hypothesis 2 sns have a positive effect on desire hypothesis 3 pbc has a positive impact on desire hypothesis 4 the desire has a positive impact on intention hypothesis 5 perceived positive emotion is positively associated with the desire hypothesis 6 perceived negative emotion is natively associated with the desire 2 2 rational choice theory rct the reason for adding rct constructs to the original model is due to the nature of the research problem and the specific context in which it is being investigated many development projects carried out in iran are imputed to the fact that the government should be in charge of project planning implementing and evaluating this is true for example in water resources management see yazdanpanah et al 2013 this viewpoint is considered true by the specialists or outsiders and by the locals or insiders while more attention is being paid to governance today than centralized and hierarchical government assuming that local people with government authorities are in charge of constructing and implementing the managerial tasks of the rwtps hypothetically it was intended to know that how local people would need to and want to benefit from the project of rwtps as a result rct constructs were used in practice the iranian energy optimization desk for is responsible for planning executing and evaluating the project of rwtps which is a government owned structure therefore it was remarkable to consider a hypothesis with the content of benefit cost in order to investigate its effect on desire and behavioral intention 2 2 1 hypothesis 7 and 8 the effect of perceived benefits costs on desire by drawing on a representative survey of respondents in senegal gaye and diallo 1997 show that the consequences of the construction of suitable and inexpensive infrastructure for home treatment plants include job creation for people moneymaking and a civic sense that would come with citizens lahijanian and mohamadi 2016 report a motive for the citizens to participate in implementing the sewerage project pertains to benefits that they reap such as maintaining the health of citizens protecting the environment reducing wastewater disposal problems providing social welfare and achieving economic efficiency respectively in the study performed by devi 2009 it was found that absolute and the relative costs of wastewater treatment compared to other options to water sources have significant limitations in wastewater treatment in developing countries the high costs of maintenance in one hand and the operation of sewage facilities in second hand have made it necessary to pay attention to the various dimensions of sewage projects dmw abfa 2012 notwithstanding financial costs account for the ethical decision making intention of wastewater treatment significantly flannery and may 2000 studied citizens partnership in the implementation and operation of sewerage projects lahijanian and mohamadi 2016 provided evidence that social costs make a stand against the public acceptance and therefore participation in sewerage projects 2 3 constructs added to the original theories 2 3 1 hypothesis 9 the effect of sympathy on desire sympathy is a noteworthy component in the discussion of social life and citizenship that leads to the cohesion of communities sympathized people probably think of the favorable unfavorable consequences of their actions received by others and this in itself can be a stimulator or deterrent of taking an action in developing countries part of less attention to environmental conservation by people devi 2009 derives from the fact that people have no sympathy for others 2 3 2 hypothesis 10 the effect of attitude towards water and wastewater authorities on the desire the poor organizational performance around wastewater systems in developing countries hinders wastewater treatment while in developed countries institutional and legal arrangements for wastewater treatment are stimulators to strongly initialize the wastewater treatment and recycling policies devi 2009 according to lahijanian and mohamadi 2016 citizens dissatisfaction with the performance of the water and sewerage company wsc preclude citizens participation in the wastewater collection program hypothesis 7 perceived benefits have a positive impact on desire hypothesis 8 perceived costs have a negative impact on desire hypothesis 9 sympathy has a positive impact on desire hypothesis 10 villagers views on water and wastewater official authorities have a positive effect on desire 3 materials and methods 3 1 research site this cross sectional study was conducted from 28 may 2020 to 14 september 2020 in the two villages upstream of alavian dam in maragheh township azerbaijan sharqi iran including ghishlaq and tazeh kand see fig 1 a the reason for selecting the two sites is that these villages carry village wastewater away discharged into the water stored behind the dam alavian dam lies 3 km away from maragheh township in the north with the water capacity of 120 million cubic meters built across the sufi chai river to provide drinking water to the townships of maragheh miandoab bonab ajab shir and malekan 3 2 sample the local people of the two villages of ghishlaq and tazeh kand constituted the study population n 806 given the number of people above 18 aged in the research population and the margin of error equaling 5 confidence 95 in accordance with the krejcie morgan s sample size table we selected respondents randomly obtained a total of 210 questionnaires of which 180 questionnaires entailed valid and complete information with a rate of valid recovery of 85 71 3 3 operational definitions of variables reliability and validity the two kinds of questions were included in the questionnaire 1 perceived questions items that are related to the constructs of theoretical framework measured by a 5 point likert scale from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree and 2 factual questions the subsequent sections of the article would display the items by which the concepts of the theoretical model were measured the cronbach s alpha method and composite reliability cr were used to assess the consistency of indicator variables with the latent variables carried out on the platform of smartpls3 2 9 software https www smartpls com 3 4 protocol to find the best location of rwtps the suitability index si was developed to determine the best location of constructing rwtps by formulating fcs which incorporates a set of data layers entailing both technical and social datasets the fcs is a multi criteria decision making technique that integrates fuzzy membership function fmf from the fuzzy theory zadeh 1965 with catastrophe functions from catastrophe theory thom 1987 we elaborate on data layers and fcs as follows 1 topography t is obtained by aster digital elevation model dem with 12 5 m resolution see fig 2 b which renders 1282 pixels this resolution is the same for other layers 2 distance from the river d is provided with identifying river path from dem and using the euclidian distance toolbox in a gis processing software see fig 2c the proximity of the treatment plant to the river is a threat to its operation and therefore the distance from the river has an indirect proportionality with si 3 land use l is prepared by using the sentinel 2 image satellite and normalized difference vegetation index after applying atmospheric and geometric corrections and classifying by the maximum likelihood method three land uses are identified i e irrigated barren and built up lands see fig 2d 4 slope s is calculated by using aster dem with a percentage unit see fig 2e this data layer has an indirect proportionality with si the processed data layers are normalized by using triangular fmf concerning direct or indirect proportionality of data layers to si of incorporated data layers the topography and land use are normalized by using eq 1a and the distance from the river and slope data layers are normalized by using eq 1b 1a x norm x x m i n x m a x x m i n 1b x n o r m x m a x x x m a x x m i n where xmax and xmin are maximum and minimum pixel values for a data layer respectively and xnorm is the normalized value of an arbitrary pixel x 4 results 4 1 analysis of participation data 4 1 1 descriptive statistics the average age of the respondents is 39 05 st d 14 71 the majority of respondents are the head of households 152 people 84 4 the rest of the respondents are not inclusive of the household head 26 people 14 4 furthermore the highest frequency of respondents falls into the category of secondary school and high school while the lowest number of respondents is in the college class the average number of labor force above 18 year in the household is 2 53 st d 1 40 the average monthly income of the household is almost 13 465 670 rials table 1 displays the measures of latent variables that were intersected with the levels of descriptive characteristics some of the measures are statistically different at the respective levels 4 1 2 inferential statistics 4 1 2 1 evaluation of reliability and validity of indicator variables to bring surely the relevancy of the questionnaire items as well as the generalizability of the research results the validity of the questionnaire and the reliability of the research indicators was assessed the partial least square pls method was used in addition to the assessment of the reliability indices of cronbach s method the composite reliability cr was also applied allowing us to compare the results of the two reliability indicators the point that should come into view is that the measurements obtained from cronbach s alpha and the cr should be higher than the cutoff measure of 0 70 i e cr and cronbach s alpha 0 70 additionally the convergent validity index was used to evaluate the correlation of inter item of the concepts ave average variance extracted was used to the cutoff limit above 0 50 ave 0 50 cr ave see abadi et al 2020 part of the confirmatory analysis of data includes the fornell larcker method by which it is possible to assess discriminant validity dv reflecting upon the dissimilarity in the measurement of different structures by a measuring instrument see esposito vinzi et al 2010 p 696 an acceptable value for the dv is generated when the between construct correlations are less than the square root of the ave associated with each construct wilson and lankton 2009 p 217 upon the realization of these measurements the validity of the distinction is confirmed the cross loadings analysis cla was carried for the purpose of making sure that an item not being loaded on more than one latent variable based on the results of the above multiplied analyzes i e cronbach s alpha cr ave fornell larcker criterion and cross loadings it was found that the questionnaire is an approval measurement tool for the study see tables 2 and 3 table 4 displays the values of cross loadings these measures show that indicator variables are well loaded on the latent variables which are greater than 0 70 4 1 2 2 assessment of model fit criteria we also investigated the value of standardized root mean square residual srmr an important model fit criterion which is the difference between the observed correlation and the model implied correlation matrix allowing the assessment of the average magnitude of the discrepancies between observed and expected correlations henseler et al 2014 introduce the srmr as a goodness of fit measure for pls sem that can be used to avoid model misspecification https www smartpls com documentation algorithms and techniques model fit as declared by hu and bentler 1999 values less than 0 10 or 0 08 are the best for this model fit index in this study the value of srmr is 0 07 indicating that the model matches with the data well using blindfolding technique the construct cross validated redundancy was estimated a measure of q2 with acceptable value is above 0 30 in this study the values of q2 range from 0 38 to 0 40 approving of fitting and being predictive relevance of the model 4 1 2 3 hypothesis testing before evaluating the path coefficients in the pls sem the two indices vif and tolerance were evaluated therefore the results were with no interference of the collinearity effect see table 5 the resulting evidence provided by carrying out pls sem indicated that attitude towards participation has a positive impact on desire β a t t d e s i r e 0 50 p 0 001 sδ 6 16 thus h1 was authenticated pbc is a driver that contributes to predicting the variance of desire thereby pbc accounts for the desire to participate in constructing and managing the rwtps β p b c d e s i r e 0 41 p 0 001 sδ 3 55 therefore supporting h3 furthermore the highest amount of beta coefficient associated with the path of desire int displays the positive and the strong impact of desire on intention β d e s i r e i n t 0 77 p 0 001 sδ 8 91 confirmed h4 we gained insight into the impact of positive emotion on desire as positive emotion increases it is much likely to constitute the desire to participate in the construction and management of rwtps β p e d e s i r e 0 23 p 0 01 sδ 3 17 therefore such result provides evidence for the confirmation of h5 one shocking result gained in this study was the negative impact of perceived benefits on desire β b n f d e s i r e 0 27 p 0 001 sδ 3 34 also perceived costs negatively contribute to shaping desire thus the hypothesis 7 is not ratified additionally perceived costs are able to predict the variance of desire negatively β c o s t d e s i r e 0 15 p 0 001 sδ 3 38 hence confirming hypothesis h8 see table 6 as shown in table 7 r2 and cohen s d indicate that the conceptual model fits well with data the appropriate value for the r2 and cohen s d is therefore an indication of the appropriate and the real effect of the variables affecting the behavioral intention fig 3 shows the results of running the rct we removed the constructs of rct from the original model and run the model once again the removal of the constructs of tgdb and the desire intention linkage stayed with only the constructs of tgdb by ruing rct it resulted in 0 08 for the value of the srmr when all of the constructs of two models are combined together the best result was obtained i e srmr less 0 08 srmr less 0 076 see fig 4 4 2 analysis of location data the relative priority of data layers and their combination of catastrophe functions were implemented as follows i identifying control parameters of data layers for a data layer the number of control parameter corresponds to the number of classifications which are determined by statistical evaluation e g sadeghfam et al 2016 or expert judgment e g ahmed et al 2016 also the number of control parameters determines the type of catastrophe function table 8 presents different types of catastrophe functions the number of state variables and control parameters ii calculating the dependency of a state variable with control parameters after identifying the control parameters the state variable to a control parameter i e a class of data layer is calculated by using equations in table 8 the priority of data layers to si and can be calculated as per complementary and non complementary principles wang et al 2011 the complementary principle considers the meaning of state variables as the state of a system whereas the non complementary principle considers the minimum of state variables like the state of a system iii calculating si after calculating the priorities of the incorporated data layers as per the complementary principles si is calculated by considering all data layers as control parameters and using the butterfly catastrophe equation notably si has four data layers control parameters then the butterfly catastrophe is selected si is calculated as follows 2 s i l a y e r 1 2 l a y e r 2 3 l a y e r 3 4 l a y e r 4 5 4 where layer1 to layer4 replace respectively layers with minimum to maximum priorities among e d l and s data layers in the formalized form table 9 expounds on fcs to calculate the priorities of data layers to si column 2 represents control parameters or classifications for each data layer which are determined by the jenks optimization method jenks 1967 column 3 shows the mean values for each control parameter column 4 represents the normalization of mean values column 3 concerning direct or indirect proportionality column 5 displays the type of catastrophe functions concerning the number of control parameters column 6 represents state values for each control parameter by using the equations in table 1 column 7 shows the priorities of data layers by using the complementary principle which are the mean values of column 6 as per this column e s l and d data layers have the high to low priorities to si respectively the priorities of data layers were delineated then si was calculated employing the butterfly catastrophe function in eq 2 in which d l s and e data layers are substituted to layer1 to layer4 fig 5 illustrates the spatial distribution of si which was classified into five bands using jenks optimization method colored in green to red representing the appropriate and inappropriate sites to construct rwtps accordingly northwest areas are located in bands 1 and 2 which are appropriate areas referencing to technical and social aspects of incorporating data layers meanwhile west and northwest are located in bands 4 5 characterized by inappropriate areas 5 discussion the result indicates that attitude towards partnership in constructing and managing the rwtps is statistically significant in predicting desire and intention delivering a promising message for initiating and putting the construction of the project into practice the resulting evidence shows that villagers potentially perceive participation as an indispensable reality through which they could reap the fruits of the project consequently their attitudes undertake the formation of the desire and behavioral intention this finding is accounted for by the notion that states that attitudes formed through the calling of the information retrieved from the memory or through online thinking about the participation steer the focus of mind attention towards the favorability of participation therefore thinking processes are stimulated to contribute to shaping the desire and behavioral intention to take part in constructing rwtps this finding is consistent with the findings of oteng peprah et al 2020 flannery and may 2000 abdelradi et al 2017 cabaniss 2014 wang and lin 2020 the result also demonstrates that pbc is a driver playing a role in constituting the desire to participate in rwtps providing evidence that villagers perceived that they have internal competencies and possess facilities to share with the project authorities in constructing the rwtps this issue is especially considerable when the centralized and hierarchical government as the main actor being in charge of implementing the project concludes that successfully initiating the project will be achieved if the government agents work and are accompanied by the local people this condition makes it easier to put the construction of rwtps into practice as efficiently as possible even after the construction of the project the local people will be needed to be recruited in order to manage the activities of rwtps in general a higher level of pbc will give insiders the freedom and authority to play a more active role in building the project the positive effect of pbc on the desire has been documented by previous studies for instance wang and lin 2020 abdelradi et al 2017 oteng peprah et al 2020 madden et al cited in prouty et al 2018 cabaniss 2014 wangui 2016 it was found that desire plays a leading role in shaping the intention to join in the construction of rwtps villagers desire is of course aroused by receiving the sensory data obtained from online visiting of successful projects of rwtps or from viewing pictures and reading about the successful projects even desire is stimulated by sharing the subject of the construction of rwtps by experts with villagers which is an influential way to constitute their minds particularly with those who have never had a mental background and experience of being exposed to such issue this finding is in harmony with the finding of the study conducted by richetin et al 2010 the effect of positive emotions on desire is also positively significant emotion is more extractable and objective in terms of expression of the human brain system than mentality in this case the enthusiasm of the villagers could play a role in constituting the desire and behavioral intention the function of the concept of desire would be imperative especially in the latest completing phases of the construction of the rwtps this finding is upheld by richetin et al 2010 the study disclosed the negative effect of perceived benefits on desire this result would probably go back to the survey time in essence the benefits of an object are perceived in both objective and subjective ways the former is achieved when a person would have experienced seen worked and observed the benefits of collaborating in taking an action in this case participation in the construction of rwtps allegedly objective and experienced benefits the latter returns to a state that a person is asked to comment on the benefits of an object that he has never experienced seen worked and observed which is generally a new object for the person i e perceived benefits therefore according to this result it seems that the nature of measuring the construct has been of the second type furthermore the lower the costs of participating in the project especially financial expenses the greater the willingness and intention is developed this finding is in compliance with flannery and may 2000 and lahijanian and mohamadi 2016 the gis based decision support systems dsss like site selection are faced with subjectivities regarding the quantification of data layers and calculation of a related index the subjectivity with index calculation can be reduced by methods such as the fuzzy catastrophe scheme unlike methods based on expert judgment such as the analytical hierarchy process forman and gass 2001 furthermore the study aims to reduce the subjectivity with the quantification of data layers by integrating the dds model with the socio cognitive model to the best of the authors knowledge this is a first attempt which is carried out by quantifying the land use data layer using questionnaire data furthermore a research driven program in partnership with the university of maragheh and institute of water and energy by sharif university for constructing a rwtp revealed the necessity of the integration of the social cognitive model and the gis based model however there is a room for extending the integration in the future research for various case studies 6 conclusions and management implications this study addressed the two objectives of investigating villagers desire and intention to participate in constructing and managing rwtps and finding the best place to locate the rwtps the attitude is one of the influential constructs shaping desire and behavioral intention the change agents of the water and sewage department need to deliver a detailed description of the desirableness of participating in the project to villagers attainable through individual and collective training methods besides these agents are suggested to give insights to rural people about participation in constructing and managing the rwtps by programs broadcasted by mass media which play a substantial role in forming favorable attitudes respondents also indicated that they have the perceived ability to participate in constructing and managing rwtps a promising finding for policy makers to initiate maintain and put the construction of the project into practice the perceived ability includes intrinsic effort based personality internalized capabilities acquired by informal formal education and accessible environmental facilities in this case most of the respondents have a high regard for their internal abilities to cooperate in turn the respondents stand against participation through paying for the financial expenses of the project in the same vein the negative impact of perceived costs shows that the respondents are not able to pay for part of the costs of constructing the project because of being included in low income families therefore it is recommended to employ local people as the labor to construct the project even young people should be recruited to handle the managerial activities of rwtps desire also has a strong influence on intention officials and experts of the water and sewage department are recommended to broadcast extension films in local meetings about other cases that were successful in stimulating rural communities to construct the rwtps furthermore tours should be provided so that informant villagers visit the successful and pioneer sewage treatment sites in other provinces or regions to convey their experiences to the target communities even the broadcast of news of rwtps by local radio programs may serve to shape the desire and behavioral intention given the effect of positive emotion on desire it is suggested by conducting qualitative exploratory research methods to identify the villagers who have a great passion and enthusiasm for the advancement of their villages these people could be designated to be the local leaders of the project because their passion and enthusiasm lead them to stay with other local people in one hand and with the officials and experts of the water and sewage department on the other hand the research was exposed to three limitations first some of the respondents were not familiar with the construction and management of rwtps they found it hard to understand the second limitation includes the differentiation of three concepts of attitude desire and intention by respondents attitude can be distinguished from the two constructs of intention and desire due to the nature of desirability and undesirability the problem remains with the separation of the two constructs of desire and intention theoretically we believe that behavioral intention is more stable than desire desire is rooted in feeling and excitement stances which makes it flexible as one becomes aroused and gets emotional for example by coming cross a stimulating phenomenon communicating with a person with specific charisma or seeing an object already wished to have third the generalization of the results to other cases should proceed with caution it is suggested to conduct more research on the decision making process of involving the local people in the management of rwtps after completing the construction of the project and its initiation further research is needed to investigate the perceived benefits of the villagers about participating in the managerial affairs of the rwtps declaration of competing interest none acknowlegement this paper has been extracted from the research
