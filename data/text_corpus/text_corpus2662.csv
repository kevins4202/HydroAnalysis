cost effective source of metabolites such as lipids carbohydrates pigments sugars essential non essential amino acids antioxidants etc that have commercial importance microalgae have been the subject of recent research as a sustainable feedstock for the large scale production of these metabolites for commercial purposes 1 3 another rapid population growth urbanization and industrialization have contributed to serious water contaminations due to the disposal of untreated toxic organic inorganic effluents including heavy metal pollutants e g cd pb hg cr zn cr etc in freshwater bodies heavy metal pollutants enter food chains through contaminated water and pose a critical threat to the lives of humans animals aquatic bodies and healthy ecosystems 4 5 ignorant and uncontrolled discharge of heavy metals contaminants is gradually increasing their concentrations in wastewater lead pb and cadmium cd are among the most toxic and carcinogenic heavy metals that enter healthy ecosystems through industrial effluents this has drawn the attention of several researchers towards its management and removal from aquatic systems 6 7 microalgae are a promising candidate for green bioremediation technologies that several researchers have been focused on around the world 8 10 several conventional physicochemical techniques have been employed for the removal of heavy metal contaminants from wastewater such as chemical precipitation coagulation membrane filtration adsorption chemical oxidation reduction solvent extraction reverse osmosis ion exchange electro dialysis etc 11 13 recently different bioremediation techniques using various microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and microalgae have been reported to accumulate heavy metals in their cells 14 15 among microorganisms microalgae are a powerful candidate for the bioremediation of heavy metal contaminants in wastewater through efficient biosorption and bioaccumulation mechanisms furthermore the microalgae biomass produced contains various value added biomolecules that can be used for different applications including bioenergy biofuels products 16 18 most microalgae based approaches for heavy metals bioremediation or biomass to biofuel generation are based on traditional methods of modifying improving cultivation methods 19 developments of advanced and integrated approaches require the comprehensive insight of microalgal metabolomics to understand the biosynthetic pathways responsible for these functions research in the field of algomics is limited and imminent researchers are focusing in this direction to make a leap in the research and development of microalgae based techniques 20 22 different researchers have recognized the benefits of microalgae for heavy metals bioremediation as well as biofuels 21 27 however key areas requiring an approach to the development of algal biofuel systems include the development of easy and efficient cultivating methods with high oil yields that can easily be scaled up to large scale production systems in a sustainable way 21 28 31 researchers therefore are now focusing on omic approaches in microalgae research 32 34 the present work suggests a green bioremediation approach towards heavy metal bioremediation and biofuel production using microalgae metabolomics and lipidomics approaches during the present investigations 1h nmr based lipidomics and metabolomics studies were used in conjunction with other methods to reveal lipid profiles in two novel microalgae strains viz chlorosarcinopsis bastropiensis ind jiht 4 and polyedriopsis spinulosa ind jiht ii in response to cd ii and pb ii tolerance icp ms investigations were used to determine the bioaccumulation of cd ii and pb ii by each microalga and to infer any correlation between heavy metal tolerance and simultaneous bioaccumulation by microalgae 2 materials and methods 2 1 isolation and characterization of microalgae chlorosarcinopsis bastropiensis ind jiht 4 was isolated using water samples collected from gangotri uttarakhand india the isolation of polyedriopsis spinulosa ind jiht ii was done from water samples collected from naraingarh haryana india pure cultures were isolated in bold s basal medium bbm by streaking of 1 water samples 35 36 furthermore molecular characterization and identification were performed by constructing phylogenetic trees based on 26s rrna sequences using mega 6 software 37 2 2 microalgae cultivation and short term assay of heavy metal toxicity to microalgal cells c bastropiensis and p spinulosa were cultured in bbm for stock culture the logarithmic phase of the stock cultures was used as inoculum and the initial optical density od of microalgae culture was measured 0 2 for heavy metal toxicity studies during the growth of the microalgae we have observed the stationary phase around 14th days for this purpose both isolated microalgae were cultured in bbm supplemented with varying concentrations of pbcl2 100 1000 mg l and cdcl2 50 250 mg l along with the control for 96 h to determine the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 values ic50 values were calculated by plotting separate graphs between the growth rates of the microalgae against the different concentrations of heavy metals after 96 h of culture using linear interpolation analysis in microsoft excel 2010 the estimated concentration of the ic50 values of pbcl2 and cdcl2 was used to cultivate the microalgae c bastropiensis and p spinulosa for 14 days heavy metal toxicity is known to greatly influence pigment accumulation growth rate and biomass productivity in microalgal cells in order to establish a correlation between them the above mentioned parameters were also recorded pigments were determined on the 10th day of culture by centrifuging 2 ml of culture at 5500 rpm the collected cell pellets were incubated at 45 c for 30 min with 2 ml of methanol the supernatant was finally separated by centrifuging the contents again at 5500 rpm and recording the absorbance at 665 2 nm 652 4 nm 470 nm and 750 nm finally the following equations eqs 1 3 were used to calculate the amounts μg ml of various pigments 38 for short term metal toxicity studies 100 mg of the microalgae biomass was collected on the 4th day of culture and subjected to ftir analysis 1 chlorophyll a chl a μg ml

absorbance at 652 4 nm and a 470 is the absorbance at 470 nm 2 3 long term heavy metal toxicity assay by metabolites analysis and lipidomics studies lipids were estimated after 14 days of culture in the control as well as in cultures stressed by supplemented heavy metals microalgae biomass was harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 8000 rpm the harvested biomass was dried and stored for further analysis lipids were extracted from microalgal biomass using the modified method of bligh and dyer 39 the lipid contents and productivity were estimated using the following equations eqs 4 and 5 for lipidomics studies 10 mg of the extracted microalgae lipids were added to 550 μl of deuterated chloroform cdcl3 and applied for 1h nmr 500 mhz nmr to record the spectra and identify any chemical shifts in lipid profiles 39 for metabolite analysis we have followed the sample preparation and nmr method according to azizan et al 2018 40 briefly 100 mg of the lyophilized microalgae biomass was mixed in 50 ml of methanol and vortexes for 5 min cell disruption was achieved by sonication for 30 min using an ultrasonic water bath at room temperature the extract was separated from cell debris by filtration through whatman filter paper no 1 the residue was dried and used for re extraction with methanol as above twice the filtered extracts were collected together and dried using a rotary

metabolomics studies for pb ii and cd ii tolerance using icp ms biomass productivity and dry cell weight dcw were determined after 14 days of microalgae cultivation by recording the od at 686 nm the microalgae biomass harvested by centrifugation was washed 2 3 times with distilled water to remove unbound heavy metals another 100 mg of biomass was subjected to acid digestion by incubating with hydrochloric acid nitric acid 3 1 v v at 120 c until a clear solution was obtained finally the solution was diluted with h2o and filtered intracellular concentrations of pb ii and cd ii were then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkin elmer elan drc e the concentration of pb ii and cd ii remaining in the bbm medium was also analyzed by icp ms the following

chlorosarcinopsis bastropiensis ind jiht 4 genbank accession number mw485748 and polyedriopsis spinulosa ind jiht ii genbank accession number mw485748 the 23s rrna phylogenetic trees based on neighbor joining analysis are shown in figs s1 and s2 microalgae are also being explored for their tolerance to heavy metals and are used by various researchers for bioremediation and biofuel production in order to develop integrated systems 24 26 41 efficient absorption of cr cd zn pb ni and cu has been reported in phormidium sp and spirullina sp 42 3 2 values and short term toxicity assay for heavy metals on cell viability and biomass chlorosarcinopsis bastropiensis ind jiht 4 cb and polyedriopsis spinulosa ind jiht ii ps were able to grow in the presence of pbcl2 and cdcl2 and have shown considerable tolerance to pb ii and cd ii during cultivation however the differences in the tolerances to pb ii and cd ii in both microalgae have been indicated by the respective ic50 values for the supplemented heavy metals the ic50 value for cd ii in the case of c bastropiensis and p spinulosa was observed to be 76 24 mg l and 86 44 mg l respectively whereas the ic50 value for pb ii in the case of c bastropiensis and p spinulosa was 397 75 mg l and 490 16 mg l respectively the respective ic50 values indicate the concentrations of pb ii and cd ii that do not induce cell toxicity as evidenced by cell viability cell viability and ic50 values of heavy metal stressed microalgae cultures are presented in fig 1 a b c and d the observed ic50 values and cell viabilities of both microalgae suggest higher tolerances towards pb ii and comparatively lower towards cd ii microalgae have demonstrated different intracellular and extracellular mechanisms to resist heavy metal toxicity and also to differentiate between essential and non essential heavy metals 9 the stress induced by heavy metals and their exertions on cell growth as well as cell viability has also been reported by other researchers the researchers have highlighted the differential responses and behavior of microalgae cultures towards different heavy metals 43 44 3 3 effect of short and long term exposure to pb ii and cd ii on pigments a decrease in the photosynthetic pigments was recorded on the 4th day of culture in both microalgae however p spinulosa was more affected by cd ii and pb ii which might be due to the rapid drop in photosynthetic pigments under heavy metals stress fig 2 a a slight reduction in chl a and chl b has been observed under heavy metals stress in comparison to the control on the 14th day of culture however it has been observed that the carotenoid levels were slightly elevated compared to the other pigments fig 2b an essential and fundamental metabolic process of microalgae is photosynthesis which drives nutrient cycling and energy flow in photosynthetic metabolism chl a is represented as the key component and chl b as alternative assessor components thereafter the improved total content of chl a and chl b could be due to the increase in chl b furthermore the decreasing chl a chl b ratio further indicated that photosynthesis could be altered by heavy metal stress within the 4th day of exposure interestingly the increase in chl a content and the similar trend in chl b content appeared to indicate that the pigments had achieved the alteration to resist heavy metal stress in exponential stages the total content of chl a and chl b have not shown any obvious distinction under different heavy metals on the 14th day of exposure however compared to the 4th day of exposure to the 14th day of heavy metal stress the chl a chl b ratio showed an inverse trend along with the increasing duration of stress exposure the concentration of ic50 of heavy metals stimulated a higher chl a chl b ratio after the 4th day of exposure which implies that the photosynthetic process could be restarted and promoted under stress conditions 45 we have also analyzed the activity of photosystem ii ps ii for c bastropiensis and p spinulosa control and heavy metal stress at 4th and 14th days using the ratio of carotenoids to chl a chl b as previously reported methods 46 similar values of control ps activity were observed for both microalgae cb and ps however microalgae stressed by heavy metals have shown higher ps ii activity indicating the viability and versatility of photosystem ii under stress conditions fig 3 the photosynthetic process is influenced by various abiotic factors such as radiation temperature heavy metals stress etc 47 photosystem ii activity is regulated by photosynthetic pigments and may have an adverse impact on prolonged exposure to heavy metals 48 the drop in the level of carotenoids is less compared to the other pigments due to their protective role on the photosynthetic apparatus against the lethal effects of heavy metals 49 dao and breadall 2016 have also reported the negative effects of heavy metal on photosystem ii in microalgae 50 3 4 effect of short and long term exposure of pb ii and cd ii on biomass and lipids the chemical structures of the biomass of microalgae grown in the control medium and under heavy metal stress have shown insignificant variances on the 4th and 14th day of culture as analyzed by ftir spectroscopy fig 4 a and b however the intensity of the absorption peaks corresponding to the hydrocarbons and other functional groups has been increased on the 14th day fig 4b in the spectra of the ftir absorption band significant positive upsurge has been observed at 1027 cm 1 584 cm 1 542 cm 1 indicating c o c stretching vibrations due to carbohydrates molecules 1248 cm 1 po asymmetric stretching or bending of the ch ring 1407 cm 1 bending of ch 1534 cm 1 1650 cm 1 protein amide bands 1744 cm 1 methyl and methylene groups in control as well as the biomass under heavy metals stress 51 thus it could be inferred that there were no significant alterations in the chemical structure of the microalgae biomass under the influence of heavy metals stress this clearly indicates the bio tolerance for both pb ii and cd ii among these microalgal species cb and ps ftir based lipid analysis of control and metal stressed microalgae reflects the chemical construction of cellular lipids fig 4c the extracted lipids from the biomass of c bastropiensi and p spinulosa on the 14th day have demonstrated intense absorption peaks at 2968 cm 1 1734 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 corresponding to the hydrocarbons of lipid molecules other chemical fingerprints of the extracted lipids have been observed in the absorption peaks at 2853 cm 1 1376 cm 1 and 964 cm 1 similar patterns of absorption bands have also been investigated in microalgal lipids under stress conditions 52 3 5 1h nmr based metabolomics and lipidomics analysis the 1h nmr based metabolite profiles of microalgae cb and ps in control and under stress conditions are illustrated in fig 5 the interpretation and comparison of the signals were analyzed according to previous reports databases in biological magnetic resonance bmr and pubchem 53 54 the spectra have indicated different classes of carbohydrates amino acids and fatty acids such as alanine valine isoleucine proline glutamic acid glycine leucine methionine glutamine palmitic acid linoleic acid α linolenic acid glucose and sucrose some insignificant signals for alanine leucine and methionine have been observed in the spectra of c bastropiensis metabolites likewise an insignificant signal for glutamine linoleic acid and α linolenic acid was observed for p spinulosa the composition of the microalgal metabolites from the control and heavy metal stressed cultures appeared similar however stronger peaks were recorded under the influence of heavy metals compared to the control indicating overexpression of the metabolites this indicates the toxic behavior of pb ii and cd ii generates stress to microalgae cells which respond in terms of elevated expression of metabolites the 1h nmr based spectra of the lipids isolated from the control medium and from the microalgae cells cultured under heavy metals stress are shown in fig 6 the chemical structure of the lipids isolated from the control culture and the culture stressed under pb ii is relatively analogous to each other such as methyl methylene methine α to carbonyl alkynyl nitromethylene alcohols α to oxygen esters ph h aromatics vinyl and arh while distinct peaks were recorded in lipids of microalgae stressed under cd ii this can be attributed to characteristic lipid accumulation behaviors under different heavy metal stresses a strong singlet signal at 5 5 ppm representing fatty acid residues proton of arh was reported in both microalgae grown in control and under the stress of pb ii a similar signal has been reported in scenedesmus sp iitrind2 55 the insignificant signals were recorded at 0 5 1 0 ppm ch3 and 1 0 1 5 ppm ch2 n in the control as well as in the heavy metal stressed microalgal lipids a similar signal has been described in chlorella sorokiniana lipids grown under stress conditions 52 a proton signal has been detected in microalgae growing in wastewater at 0 5 1 0 ppm 39 a strong signal was noticed at 3 5 4 0 ppm ro ch3 in the lipids of p spinulosa grown in the control medium a weak signal at this position has been observed in lipids obtained from microalgae grown in pb ii and cd ii medium during the present study 3 6 principal component analysis pca the effect of heavy metal stress by pb ii and cd ii on microalgae was determined by principal component analysis pca pca is a powerful statistical tool that helps to classify samples based on their chemical composition 56 fig 7 illustrates the pca score plot for control and metal stressed microalgae cb and ps the stress was separated by pc1 the control microalgae extract separated from cd ii and pb ii by pc1 at a variance of 71 3 and pc2 at a variance of 21 fig 8 elucidates the heat map for control and metal stressed microalgae cb and ps showing variations in metabolites under heavy metals stress as well as under control conditions the stress was separated by pc1 the control microalgae extract separated from cd ii and pb ii by pc1 at a variance of 59 5 and pc2 at a variance of 23 2 3 7 metabolomics analysis for pb ii and cd ii tolerance using icp ms the biomass productivity in dcw of c bastropiensis in the control pb ii and cd ii were observed to be 38 74 1 3 mg l d 39 29 0 3 mg l d and 38 48 0 5 mg l d respectively similarly it was observed that the biomass productivity of p spinulosa in the control pb ii and cd ii was 33 13 0 6 mg l d 33 22 0 4 mg l d and 33 56 0 5 mg l d respectively fig 9 the results revealed that the biomass productivity of c bastropiensis was higher than that of p spinulosa under control and heavy metal stress conditions furthermore the biomass productivity dcw under heavy metal stress was slightly high with insignificant differences in the stationary stages a slight reduction in cell growth and biomass productivity was noted in microalgae c bastropiensis under the influence of cd ii on the contrary an upsurge in cell growth and biomass productivity was observed both in microalgae in the presence of pb ii which indicates a greater tolerance and therefore a greater affinity for pb ii than for cd ii in both microalgae the concentration of heavy metals in the biomass of c bastropiensis was analyzed as 329 32 mg l and 26 81 mg l for pb ii and cd ii respectively similarly the concentration of heavy metals in p spinulosa biomass was analyzed as 406 72 mg l and 401 6 mg l for pb ii and cd ii respectively the concentration of heavy metals remaining in the medium bbm was found to be 10 81 mg l and 11 17 mg l for pb ii and cd ii respectively in c bastropiensis however in p spinulosa it was observed that the concentration of heavy metals remaining in the medium bbm was 13 73 mg l and 7 7 mg l for pb ii and cd ii respectively furthermore the bioaccumulation concentration of pb ii and cd ii was found to be 0 073 mg kg dcw and 0 430 mg kg dcw in c bastropiensis similarly the bioaccumulation concentration of pb ii and cd ii was found to be 0 622 mg kg dcw and 0 182 mg kg dcw in p spinulosa the bioaccumulation studies were also synchronized with the above mentioned findings where a greater accumulation of pb ii was recorded in the biomass obtained from both microalgae compared to cd ii p spinulosa have shown the highest bioaccumulation of pb ii as to be 0 622 mg kg dcw the maximum bioaccumulation of cd ii in c bastropiensis was observed to be 0 430 mg kg dcw bioaccumulation assays suggest that there is no correlation between cellular tolerance and bioaccumulation of heavy metals by microalgae supporting the findings of debelius et al 2009 where they have reported similar bioaccumulation behavior in on cells by different microalgae irrespective of their heavy metal tolerance 57 the results also support the findings of abirhire and kadiri 2011 where they have reported that each microalga has different metal concentration factors for specific heavy metals 58 the bioaccumulation of cd ii and pb ii by both species of microalgae during this study was also specific for the distinctive heavy metals 4 conclusions the findings of the metabolomics and lipidomics studies during the present study suggest the following conclusions there is no correlation between cellular tolerance and the bioaccumulation of each heavy metal by both microalgae there are significant alterations in the biochemical composition of the microalgae metabolites under heavy metal stress however its levels upsurge in response to stress conditions as a defense strategy microalgae accumulate higher amounts of unsaturated fatty acids under the influence of heavy metals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

chlorosarcinopsis bastropiensis ind jiht 4 genbank accession number mw485748 and polyedriopsis spinulosa ind jiht ii genbank accession number mw485748 the 23s rrna phylogenetic trees based on neighbor joining analysis are shown in figs s1 and s2 microalgae are also being explored for their tolerance to heavy metals and are used by various researchers for bioremediation and biofuel production in order to develop integrated systems 24 26 41 efficient absorption of cr cd zn pb ni and cu has been reported in phormidium sp and spirullina sp 42 3 2 values and short term toxicity assay for heavy metals on cell viability and biomass chlorosarcinopsis bastropiensis ind jiht 4 cb and polyedriopsis spinulosa ind jiht ii ps were able to grow in the presence of pbcl2 and cdcl2 and have shown considerable tolerance to pb ii and cd ii during cultivation however the differences in the tolerances to pb ii and cd ii in both microalgae have been indicated by the respective ic50 values for the supplemented heavy metals the ic50 value for cd ii in the case of c bastropiensis and p spinulosa was observed to be 76 24 mg l and 86 44 mg l respectively whereas the ic50 value for pb ii in the case of c bastropiensis and p spinulosa was 397 75 mg l and 490 16 mg l respectively the respective ic50 values indicate the concentrations of pb ii and cd ii that do not induce cell toxicity as evidenced by cell viability cell viability and ic50 values of heavy metal stressed microalgae cultures are presented in fig 1 a b c and d the observed ic50 values and cell viabilities of both microalgae suggest higher tolerances towards pb ii and comparatively lower towards cd ii microalgae have demonstrated different intracellular and extracellular mechanisms to resist heavy metal toxicity and also to differentiate between essential and non essential heavy metals 9 the stress induced by heavy metals and their exertions on cell growth as well as cell viability has also been reported by other researchers the researchers have highlighted the differential responses and behavior of microalgae cultures towards different heavy metals 43 44 3 3 effect of short and long term exposure to pb ii and cd ii on pigments a decrease in the photosynthetic pigments was recorded on the 4th day of culture in both microalgae however p spinulosa was more affected by cd ii and pb ii which might be due to the rapid drop in photosynthetic pigments under heavy metals stress fig 2 a a slight reduction in chl a and chl b has been observed under heavy metals stress in comparison to the control on the 14th day of culture however it has been observed that the carotenoid levels were slightly elevated compared to the other pigments fig 2b an essential and fundamental metabolic process of microalgae is photosynthesis which drives nutrient cycling and energy flow in photosynthetic metabolism chl a is represented as the key component and chl b as alternative assessor components thereafter the improved total content of chl a and chl b could be due to the increase in chl b furthermore the decreasing chl a chl b ratio further indicated that photosynthesis could be altered by heavy metal stress within the 4th day of exposure interestingly the increase in chl a content and the similar trend in chl b content appeared to indicate that the pigments had achieved the alteration to resist heavy metal stress in exponential stages the total content of chl a and chl b have not shown any obvious distinction under different heavy metals on the 14th day of exposure however compared to the 4th day of exposure to the 14th day of heavy metal stress the chl a chl b ratio showed an inverse trend along with the increasing duration of stress exposure the concentration of ic50 of heavy metals stimulated a higher chl a chl b ratio after the 4th day of exposure which implies that the photosynthetic process could be restarted and promoted under stress conditions 45 we have also analyzed the activity of photosystem ii ps ii for c bastropiensis and p spinulosa control and heavy metal stress at 4th and 14th days using the ratio of carotenoids to chl a chl b as previously reported methods 46 similar values of control ps activity were observed for both microalgae cb and ps however microalgae stressed by heavy metals have shown higher ps ii activity indicating the viability and versatility of photosystem ii under stress conditions fig 3 the photosynthetic process is influenced by various abiotic factors such as radiation temperature heavy metals stress etc 47 photosystem ii activity is regulated by photosynthetic pigments and may have an adverse impact on prolonged exposure to heavy metals 48 the drop in the level of carotenoids is less compared to the other pigments due to their protective role on the photosynthetic apparatus against the lethal effects of heavy metals 49 dao and breadall 2016 have also reported the negative effects of heavy metal on photosystem ii in microalgae 50 3 4 effect of short and long term exposure of pb ii and cd ii on biomass and lipids the chemical structures of the biomass of microalgae grown in the control medium and under heavy metal stress have shown insignificant variances on the 4th and 14th day of culture as analyzed by ftir spectroscopy fig 4 a and b however the intensity of the absorption peaks corresponding to the hydrocarbons and other functional groups has been increased on the 14th day fig 4b in the spectra of the ftir absorption band significant positive upsurge has been observed at 1027 cm 1 584 cm 1 542 cm 1 indicating c o c stretching vibrations due to carbohydrates molecules 1248 cm 1 po asymmetric stretching or bending of the ch ring 1407 cm 1 bending of ch 1534 cm 1 1650 cm 1 protein amide bands 1744 cm 1 methyl and methylene groups in control as well as the biomass under heavy metals stress 51 thus it could be inferred that there were no significant alterations in the chemical structure of the microalgae biomass under the influence of heavy metals stress this clearly indicates the bio tolerance for both pb ii and cd ii among these microalgal species cb and ps ftir based lipid analysis of control and metal stressed microalgae reflects the chemical construction of cellular lipids fig 4c the extracted lipids from the biomass of c bastropiensi and p spinulosa on the 14th day have demonstrated intense absorption peaks at 2968 cm 1 1734 cm 1 and 1460 cm 1 corresponding to the hydrocarbons of lipid molecules other chemical fingerprints of the extracted lipids have been observed in the absorption peaks at 2853 cm 1 1376 cm 1 and 964 cm 1 similar patterns of absorption bands have also been investigated in microalgal lipids under stress conditions 52 3 5 1h nmr based metabolomics and lipidomics analysis the 1h nmr based metabolite profiles of microalgae cb and ps in control and under stress conditions are illustrated in fig 5 the interpretation and comparison of the signals were analyzed according to previous reports databases in biological magnetic resonance bmr and pubchem 53 54 the spectra have indicated different classes of carbohydrates amino acids and fatty acids such as alanine valine isoleucine proline glutamic acid glycine leucine methionine glutamine palmitic acid linoleic acid α linolenic acid glucose and sucrose some insignificant signals for alanine leucine and methionine have been observed in the spectra of c bastropiensis metabolites likewise an insignificant signal for glutamine linoleic acid and α linolenic acid was observed for p spinulosa the composition of the microalgal metabolites from the control and heavy metal stressed cultures appeared similar however stronger peaks were recorded under the influence of heavy metals compared to the control indicating overexpression of the metabolites this indicates the toxic behavior of pb ii and cd ii generates stress to microalgae cells which respond in terms of elevated expression of metabolites the 1h nmr based spectra of the lipids isolated from the control medium and from the microalgae cells cultured under heavy metals stress are shown in fig 6 the chemical structure of the lipids isolated from the control culture and the culture stressed under pb ii is relatively analogous to each other such as methyl methylene methine α to carbonyl alkynyl nitromethylene alcohols α to oxygen esters ph h aromatics vinyl and arh while distinct peaks were recorded in lipids of microalgae stressed under cd ii this can be attributed to characteristic lipid accumulation behaviors under different heavy metal stresses a strong singlet signal at 5 5 ppm representing fatty acid residues proton of arh was reported in both microalgae grown in control and under the stress of pb ii a similar signal has been reported in scenedesmus sp iitrind2 55 the insignificant signals were recorded at 0 5 1 0 ppm ch3 and 1 0 1 5 ppm ch2 n in the control as well as in the heavy metal stressed microalgal lipids a similar signal has been described in chlorella sorokiniana lipids grown under stress conditions 52 a proton signal has been detected in microalgae growing in wastewater at 0 5 1 0 ppm 39 a strong signal was noticed at 3 5 4 0 ppm ro ch3 in the lipids of p spinulosa grown in the control medium a weak signal at this position has been observed in lipids obtained from microalgae grown in pb ii and cd ii medium during the present study 3 6 principal component analysis pca the effect of heavy metal stress by pb ii and cd ii on microalgae was determined by principal component analysis pca pca is a powerful statistical tool that helps to classify samples based on their chemical composition 56 fig 7 illustrates the pca score plot for control and metal stressed microalgae cb and ps the stress was separated by pc1 the control microalgae extract separated from cd ii and pb ii by pc1 at a variance of 71 3 and pc2 at a variance of 21 fig 8 elucidates the heat map for control and metal stressed microalgae cb and ps showing variations in metabolites under heavy metals stress as well as under control conditions the stress was separated by pc1 the control microalgae extract separated from cd ii and pb ii by pc1 at a variance of 59 5 and pc2 at a variance of 23 2 3 7 metabolomics analysis for pb ii and cd ii tolerance using icp ms the biomass productivity in dcw of c bastropiensis in the control pb ii and cd ii were observed to be 38 74 1 3 mg l d 39 29 0 3 mg l d and 38 48 0 5 mg l d respectively similarly it was observed that the biomass productivity of p spinulosa in the control pb ii and cd ii was 33 13 0 6 mg l d 33 22 0 4 mg l d and 33 56 0 5 mg l d respectively fig 9 the results revealed that the biomass productivity of c bastropiensis was higher than that of p spinulosa under control and heavy metal stress conditions furthermore the biomass productivity dcw under heavy metal stress was slightly high with insignificant differences in the stationary stages a slight reduction in cell growth and biomass productivity was noted in microalgae c bastropiensis under the influence of cd ii on the contrary an upsurge in cell growth and biomass productivity was observed both in microalgae in the presence of pb ii which indicates a greater tolerance and therefore a greater affinity for pb ii than for cd ii in both microalgae the concentration of heavy metals in the biomass of c bastropiensis was analyzed as 329 32 mg l and 26 81 mg l for pb ii and cd ii respectively similarly the concentration of heavy metals in p spinulosa biomass was analyzed as 406 72 mg l and 401 6 mg l for pb ii and cd ii respectively the concentration of heavy metals remaining in the medium bbm was found to be 10 81 mg l and 11 17 mg l for pb ii and cd ii respectively in c bastropiensis however in p spinulosa it was observed that the concentration of heavy metals remaining in the medium bbm was 13 73 mg l and 7 7 mg l for pb ii and cd ii respectively furthermore the bioaccumulation concentration of pb ii and cd ii was found to be 0 073 mg kg dcw and 0 430 mg kg dcw in c bastropiensis similarly the bioaccumulation concentration of pb ii and cd ii was found to be 0 622 mg kg dcw and 0 182 mg kg dcw in p spinulosa the bioaccumulation studies were also synchronized with the above mentioned findings where a greater accumulation of pb ii was recorded in the biomass obtained from both microalgae compared to cd ii p spinulosa have shown the highest bioaccumulation of pb ii as to be 0 622 mg kg dcw the maximum bioaccumulation of cd ii in c bastropiensis was observed to be 0 430 mg kg dcw bioaccumulation assays suggest that there is no correlation between cellular tolerance and bioaccumulation of heavy metals by microalgae supporting the findings of debelius et al 2009 where they have reported similar bioaccumulation behavior in on cells by different microalgae irrespective of their heavy metal tolerance 57 the results also support the findings of abirhire and kadiri 2011 where they have reported that each microalga has different metal concentration factors for specific heavy metals 58 the bioaccumulation of cd ii and pb ii by both species of microalgae during this study was also specific for the distinctive heavy metals 4 conclusions the findings of the metabolomics and lipidomics studies during the present study suggest the following conclusions there is no correlation between cellular tolerance and the bioaccumulation of each heavy metal by both microalgae there are significant alterations in the biochemical composition of the microalgae metabolites under heavy metal stress however its levels upsurge in response to stress conditions as a defense strategy microalgae accumulate higher amounts of unsaturated fatty acids under the influence of heavy metals declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13311,reinforced hollow fiber membranes are commercially available but its information is limited on open literature its notable mechanical properties due to the reinforced layer makes it suitable for membrane bioreactor mbr application on the other hand polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is an increasingly popular material choice for membrane used in mbr due to its good chemical resistance against chlorine present in sodium hypochlorite naocl which is commonly used as a cleaning agent the impact of naocl on the pvdf membrane characteristics was reported in literature but little information is available about the membrane performance of the aged pvdf membrane caused by naocl in mbr operation in this study the membrane performance of a reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes after naocl ageing were investigated thoroughly in mbr operations a series of characterization on virgin and fouled membranes with without naocl exposure were carried out the accelerated naocl ageing experiments revealed that reinforced hollow fiber membranes have notable mechanical strength which is not significantly affected by naocl ageing as compared to their non reinforced counterpart additionally there was no significant effect on the membrane behaviours in mbr after the membranes were exposed to a 5000 ppm naocl solution at ph 7 for 48 h which is equivalent to 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years naocl exposure using a normal dose of naocl for regular membrane cleaning however after 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years of naocl exposure the membrane failed to perform and a sharp transmembrane pressure tmp increase during mbr operation was observed the severe fouling of aged membranes was found to be attributed to the changes in hydrophobicity pore size and the foulants left on the membrane despite cleaning even though the membrane was fouled quickly after 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years of naocl exposure the permeate quality was not affected much as indicated by 90 removal for dissolved organic carbon doc and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod which suggests that the reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes used in current study exhibit considerable chemical resistance against chlorine and can be used in the mbr system for a long period of operation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pvdf naocl ageing reinforced hollow fiber membrane mbr 1 introduction membrane biological reactor mbr has been increasingly employed for wastewater treatment due to its advantages of better effluent quality smaller footprint higher volumetric loading of sludge lower sludge production and better disinfection capability compared with conventional activated sludge process 1 there is growth in use of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf material for making mbr filtration membranes due to its notable characteristics such as good flexibility 2 and excellent chemical resistance 3 in mbr applications membranes may be exposed to possible damage and breakage by the aeration system or cleaning processes reinforced hollow fiber membranes are highly suitable for mbr operation because of the high mechanical strength from the support layer and the high packing density of the membranes 4 liu et al found that polyethylene terephthalate pet strands reinforced pvdf membranes have mechanical strength improved significantly compared to hollow fiber membranes without reinforcement 5 additionally it was found that commercial pvdf reinforced membranes used in mbr systems have not encountered any hollow fiber breakage issue 6 indicating its notable mechanical strength for use in mbr commercial reinforced hollow fiber membranes have been used widely worldwide in mbr plants in usa china sweden and singapore 4 however the information of reinforced hollow fiber pvdf membrane in mbr application is limited in open literature membrane performance is one of the main concerns of mbr which is affected by membrane fouling due to the increase in foulants being accumulated on the surface and in the pores of the membranes during the filtration leading to decrease in the performance of the membrane over time therefore sodium hypochlorite naocl an oxidant is typically used to clean the membranes in mbr due to its effectiveness of removing organic and biological foulants at a low cost and its availability in the market 7 8 however apart from the removal of foulants on the membrane naocl can interact with the membrane resulting in possible changes in membrane properties and subsequent performance in mbr system and eventually affecting the membrane lifespan 9 11 there are some studies on naocl effects on the pvdf membranes in literature 12 19 one of the focuses was on how naocl affected the hydrophilic additives such as polyethylene glycol peg or polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp used to promote pore formation during membrane fabrication and membrane s hydrophilicity 12 it was found that the hydrophilic additives could be oxidised by naocl 8 10 the removal of such additives would in turn result in the changes of the membrane characteristics it was reported that membrane hydrophilicity and intrinsic membrane resistance decreased 13 while average membrane pore size increased 14 in contrast an opposite result for membrane resistance was also reported 15 but the method used to age the membranes was different wang et al used a cyclical ageing approach which placed the membranes into continuous filtration and cleaning cycles whereas most other studies used a single soaking method to age the membranes 2 3 12 13 16 the difference in the membrane resistance trend was explained to be due to the difference in irreversible fouling layer in the cyclical aged membranes which caused the increase in membrane resistance however the membrane degradation resulted in pore size increase and caused membrane resistance to decrease in single soaking aged membranes 10 besides the single soaking method is not applicable for real practice in a real application the fouled membranes together with residual foulants on the membrane were exposed to naclo for cleaning periodically the interactions among naclo membrane and foulants are expected to be different with the single soaking of virgin membranes in a naclo solution thus different ageing approaches would result in different membrane properties additionally in real application other operational factors like surface shear by air scouring backwash and fouling can affect the membrane ageing 9 the membrane performance of aged membranes is interesting for mbr operation especially for reinforced hollow fiber membranes but it was not well studied yet therefore the main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of naocl ageing on reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes with respect to their membrane performance in mbr operation which is expected to shed light on the suitability of newly developed reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes used in mbr for wastewater treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 braid reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes a pet braid reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membrane supplied by an industrial partner was used for mbr application in the experiment the membrane was fabricated via phase inversion using the non solvent induced phase separation nips technique membrane additives such as pvp and peg were used in the fabrication of the membranes 2 2 membrane characterization the braid reinforced hollow fiber membranes were pre treated using solvent exchange method to remove the preservative on the membrane surface prior to membrane characterization briefly the solvent exchange method consists of soaking the membranes in deionized di water produced by milli q system millipore usa for 24 h followed by soaking for another 24 h in 99 8 ethanol sigma aldrich usa and finally in n hexane sigma aldrich usa for another 3 h the membranes were then removed from the n hexane solution and left to dry in the fume hood for 30 min samples were subsequently kept in a vacuum desiccator until further use the membrane sample morphology was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jsm 7200f jeol japan operating at a voltage of 5 kv a thin layer of platinum was coated on the membrane surface using a sputter coater sc7620 emitech prior to analysis software imagej was used to analyse the surface porosity of the membrane atomic force microscopy afm xe 100 park systems korea was operated in the noncontact mode to obtain the surface microstructures the surface roughness of the membranes was obtained from the afm results and expressed in term of the root mean squared surface roughness r q the pore size distribution and the mean pore sizes of the membranes were measured by capillary flow porometer cfp 1500a porous material inc pmi usa the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and ultimate elongation were measured using a tensile meter instron 3342 instron usa a fourier transform infrared spectroscope with attenuated total reflectance mode atr ftir ir prestige 21 shimadzu japan was used to qualitatively analyse and identify the functional groups present on the surface of the membrane the dynamic contact angle of the hollow fiber membrane s outer surface was measured by a tensiometer dcat11 dataphysics germany prior to measurement the lumen was sealed with epoxy resin and allowed to dry overnight this was done to obtain a higher accuracy of the measurement such that only the outer surface of the membrane was in contact with the di water the membranes were potted in house into a module comprising of 8 hollow fiber strands each of 15 cm in length which resulted in a surface area of approximately 83 cm2 two modules were prepared and tested using di water as feed membrane integrity was confirmed before and after the pure water permeability pwp test the measurement of pwp was conducted at room temperature compaction on the membrane was done under the pressure of 50 kpa for 3 h the pwp was carried out at two different pressures namely 50 kpa and 30 kpa the permeate was subsequently weighted for the pwp calculation 2 3 mbr setup and operating conditions 2 3 1 mbr operation a lab scale mbr as per illustrated in fig 1 with submerged membrane modules were used in this study the two curtain like modules in the reactor contains 23 strands of hollow fibers with 14 cm in length each the total surface area of the modules were approximately 440 cm2 synthetic wastewater composition listed in table 1 were used as the incoming feed for the mbr system activated sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in singapore and acclimated with the synthetic wastewater for 2 weeks before mbr system operation the mbr system was operated continuously based on a constant membrane flux of 25 l m2h it was running with a 10 min cycle consisting of 8 min filtration and 2 min backwash the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were maintained at approximately 2 g l the mbr was operated under hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 h and solid retention time srt of 20 days air was provided for both aeration and air scouring of the membranes for fouling control the aeration rate was set at 2 5 l min the permeate pressure was recorded by digital pressure transmitter ashcroft usa connected to a data logging system labview national instrument usa 2 3 2 chemical cleaning and membrane ageing chemical cleaning was conducted when the transmembrane pressure tmp reached 40 kpa after chemical cleaning the membrane was aged prior to repeating the mbr experiment the experimental flow carried out in this study was summarized and is shown in fig 2 when the membranes were fouled the membranes were cleaned via physical and chemical cleaning physical cleaning refers to cleaning the membrane via pressurized water on the membrane surface to remove big flocs chemical cleaning was conducted by static soaking of membranes in a 1000 ppm of commercial grade naocl 10 wt solution until pwp recovered to at least 80 of the original value prior to fouling chemical cleaning timing was 6 h 38 h and 6 h after mbr runs 1 2 and 3 respectively membrane ageing was carried out with a 5000 ppm of commercial grade naocl solution with ph corrected to 7 using citric acid the membrane modules were soaked in the solution and the solution was recirculated into the membranes using a peristatic pump for 48 h the naocl contact time was calculated using the concentration of the naocl multiplied by the time and expressed in ppm hr the equivalent contact time in years was calculated based on the average total amount of naocl exposure due to maintenance and recovery cleaning in a full scale plant taken from literature 20 wang et al reported the average maintenance cleaning to take place once every month for 2 h using a concentration of 500 ppm naocl while recovery cleaning took place once a year for 18 h using 1500 ppm naocl hence it resulted in an average total naocl concentration exposed to membranes in a year to be equivalent to 40 000 ppm hr in this study including the chemical cleaning the naocl contact time after ageing cycle 1 and ageing cycle 2 was 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years and 524 000 pph hr 13 1 years respectively 2 3 3 membrane resistance calculation the membrane filtration resistance was calculated by darcy equation as shown in eq 1 1 j p μ r t p μ r m r f where j represents the membrane permeate flux m3 m2 s δp is the transmembrane pressure pa r t is the total membrane filtration resistance m 1 μ is the water viscosity pa s r f is the fouling resistance m 1 and r m is the intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 r f can be further categorised into the cake resistance r c and pore blocking resistance r pb as shown in eq 2 2 r f r c r pb 2 4 water quality and biological analytical methods the feed water mixed liquor and permeate of the mbrs were sampled twice weekly for analysis the dissolved organic carbon doc total nitrogen tn soluble chemical oxygen demand scod ammonia nh4 n and nitrates no3 n content were measured the concentrations of the doc and tn were measured using a toc analyzer asi v toc vcsh shimadzu japan scod nh4 n and no3 n were measured with vial tests cod digestion vials and nitrate tntplus vial test hach usa together with a spectrometer dr3900 laboratory spectrometer hach usa in the mbr the mlss and the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured frequently according to standard methods 21 protein was determined using the modified lowery method 22 using bovine serum albumin thermo scientific standards polysaccharide was measured using the phenol sulfuric acid method 23 with glucose sigma aldrich standards 2 5 fouled membrane autopsy membrane autopsy was conducted for the fouled membranes at the end of the mbr experiments foulants were removed from the membrane surface 8 strands of 14 cm reinforced hollow fiber membranes via soaking the membranes in 40 ml of di water followed by ultra sonicating for 5 min the well mixed foulant solution was then used for analysis of total solids ts volatile solids vs eps and adenosine triphosphate atp atp was measured based on manufacturer s recommendations kikkoman japan another part of the foulant solution was centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 x g and filtered using a 0 45 μm filter dissolved organic fractions was analysed using a liquid chromatography organic carbon detector lc ocd analyzer lc ocd model 8 doc labor germany the remaining foulant solution 20 ml was digested using 1 nitric acid and centrifuged at 4000 x g for 10 min followed by filtration through a 0 45 μm filter the filtered solution was then analysed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer usa for the inorganic elements the biofilm morphology was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica german after the membrane samples were treated with dyes briefly live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes usa were used to stain the biofilm on the membrane surface according to manufacturer s recommendations 2 6 ageing of virgin membranes on top of the mbr experiments five separate sets of small membrane modules were prepared for each of the cleaning and ageing conditions as indicated in fig 2 the membranes were subjected to the same conditions except that the mbr runs were left out at every cleaning or ageing step listed a set of membrane was sampled for the membrane characterization 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of ageing on membrane characteristics table 2 summarizes the membrane characteristics of the reinforced hollow fiber membrane the sem images of the virgin membrane s cross section and membrane surface after ageing are presented in fig 3 a homogeneously reinforced interface was observed between the membrane layer and the reinforced braid which signifies good compatibility between the braid and separation layer 24 naocl ageing caused the surface porosity to increase as evident in the sem images the surface porosity of the membrane after ageing cycle 2 increased by 2 2 times the results are consistent with the other studies which have pvdf aged membranes 12 the atr ftir spectrums of the membrane before and after ageing are shown in fig 4 the peak at 1662 cm 1 found in the membrane is associated with the amide bond vibration from pvp 25 naocl ageing cycle results in a decrease of the peak at 1662 cm 1 which indicates that pvp is degraded and removed from the membrane surface the peak is further decreased when ageing cycle 2 was conducted the decrease in pvp is consistent with results from literature 12 14 the intense peaks at 1402 cm 1 1186 cm 1 1082 cm 1 and 867 cm 1 were identified as characteristic peaks for pvdf membranes 26 no observable change to the characteristic peaks of pvdf membranes after naocl ageing was found indicating that ageing does not have effect on pvdf polymer itself the mechanical properties of the membrane were examined and results are shown in table 3 in comparison to non reinforced hollow fiber membranes the tensile stress at break that reinforced membranes can sustain is 17 2 times greater 54 94 mpa vs 3 2 mpa indicating the pet braid significantly enhance the mechanical strength of hollow fiber pvdf membrane furthermore the mechanical properties of the reinforced hollow fiber membrane were not affected by the naocl ageing and fouling from mbr the tensile stress at break and ultimate elongation remains relatively stable after ageing and fouling indicating its notable mechanical strength however the non reinforced hollow fiber pvdf membrane mechanical properties has been reported to be impacted by naocl ageing especially the elongation of non reinforced membranes after ageing exhibited a sudden reduction from 185 to 120 between the ageing time of equivalent 5 years and 10 years due to naocl resulted changes in chain scission or molecular structure rearrangement in the polymer 27 for reinforced hollow fiber pvdf membranes however the tensile strength were not affected by ageing of the membranes which suggests that the reinforced braids used have strengthened the membrane mechanical property the reinforced pvdf membrane is thus especially suitable for mbr application as process conditions such as air scouring are harsh on the membrane mechanical properties 3 2 impact of pvdf ageing on mbr performance three mbr run cycles were conducted with pvdf membrane ageing after run 1 and run 2 see fig 2 the average mlss concentrations in the mbr was 2 44 g l with a mlvss mlss ratio 0 96 the mbr permeate qualities from three runs are summarized in table 4 the mbr can achieve good removal rates of more than 90 for both doc and scod from the feed water for the membrane aged up to 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years the doc and scod removal rates were comparable with that obtained in the initial stage run 2 vs run 1 however further ageing up to 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years resulted in decrease in the doc and scod removal rates run 3 though the decrease was not dramatic for nh4 n removal most nh4 n were converted to nitrate by microorganisms in mbr the good removal efficiency of doc and nh4 n indicated that the mbrs were in good performance for biological nutrient removal 3 3 impact of pvdf ageing on mbr fouling 3 3 1 tmp profiles of aged pvdf membranes in mbr the tmp profiles for three mbr cycles are shown in fig 5 the membrane can withstand 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years of naocl chemical exposure in the initial stage run 1 the tmp increase rate was 3 23 kpa day compared with the virgin membrane the fouling performance of the reinforced pvdf membrane after 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years of naocl ageing did not show much difference in terms of average tmp increase rate the tmp increase rate for the membrane used in experiment was approximately two times lower than other reinforced pvdf membrane running at a membrane flux of 15 l m2h which had tmp increase rate of 8 57 kpa day 28 when additional ageing ageing cycle 2 was applied after run 2 equivalent to 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years of naocl exposure the fouling for the membrane was more severe evidenced by a prompt tmp jump observed the membrane has failed to perform in mbr run 3 due to rapid fouling hollow fiber membrane lifespan in mbr are usually not reported in literature it should exceed 6 years 29 and other study extrapolated membrane life up to 13 years 6 the membrane lifespan tested in the current experiment falls between the values found in literature in addition an extension of chemical cleaning time was required to achieve around 80 recovery of pwp for example the cleaning time of the membranes after mbr runs 1 2 and 3 are 6 h 38 h and 6 h respectively the cleaning time have increased by 6 3 times in the second cleaning cycle compared to the first cleaning indicating higher filtration resistance with aged membranes this result is in line with literature whereby older membranes required longer cleaning period 9 3 3 2 permeability and filtration resistance fig 6 shows the pwp of cleaned fouled membranes in mbr and aged only membranes after the first ageing cycle the aged only membranes exhibited an increase in pwp probably due to the swelling of polymer matrix caused by the oxidiser however the pwp started to decrease after 38 h cleaning and decreased by approximately 30 solely from the effect of ageing cycle 2 the difference in time frame for the drastic decrease between the membranes used in mbr and the aged only membranes is hypothesized to be due to the direct contact of the membrane surface with naocl as compared to mbr fouled membranes which have a layer of foulant left on the surface even after cleaning in fouled membranes the naocl would react with the foulants and oxidise the foulants first thus minimize the contact between the membrane surface and the ageing chemical 19 to further investigate the fouling mechanisms the fouling resistance was calculated from the pure water permeability after each cleaning and ageing cycle as demonstrated in table 5 the dominant fouling mechanism for the membranes is cake layer formation as shown from the high cake resistance percentage out of the total as tabulated there is no change in the fouling mechanism even after the membranes have been aged up to 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years more importantly the intrinsic membrane resistance has increased greatly after the 2nd ageing cycle as shown in fig 7 a the membrane resistance increased by approximately two times the increase in intrinsic membrane resistance has also been reported in other studies 15 19 due to the foulants remained on the surface of the membranes and the changes of the membrane s physical chemical properties after ageing 3 3 3 pvdf ageing induced severe fouling in mbr there are several possible reasons for the sharp tmp jump in mbr run 3 firstly it could be due to the change in hydrophilicity of the membranes the dynamic contact angle of membranes after experiments are summarized in fig 7 b there are two ongoing opposing actions on the hydrophilicity of the membranes that can be observed results from the ageing only membranes showed a decrease by 7 for the dynamic contact angle in other words the chemical reaction of the membrane with naocl caused the membrane s hydrophilicity to increase a similar trend of increasing hydrophilicity after naocl ageing on clean membranes was reported 12 15 on the other hand the opposing action is the decrease in hydrophilicity through the attachment of the hydrophobic foulants onto the surface of the membranes during the mbr operation the hydrophobic surfaces in turn would result in faster fouling of the membranes it seems the foulant attachment on the membrane surface has a greater impact on the hydrophobicity compared to the chemical reaction with naocl thus resulting in an increase in hydrophobicity of the aged membranes in mbr secondly the pore size changes of the membranes may have also resulted in the accelerated fouling in fig 8 a2 the aged membranes after mbr run 3 and cleaning have an increase in percentage of pores that are larger in size and the pore size distribution also shifts towards the smaller pore size between 18 and 26 nm diameter the pore size enlargement can be attributed to the ageing with naocl which is in line with other research 14 the increase in the number of smaller pores on the other hand is due to pore blocking by foulants thirdly the foulants left on the membrane surface after cleaning could possibly result in the accelerated fouling even though the pwps of the membranes have been recovered to 80 of the value before fouling it can be observed from the sems images shown in fig 9 a that a layer of foulant was still present on the membrane surface the autopsy results of the fouled mbr membranes are summarized in table 6 organic fouling appeared to be dominant as evidenced by a high vs ts ratio clsm images shown in fig 9 b reveals the cells on the fouled membrane surface that are mostly live cells as the organic foulants are hydrophobic in nature it promoted more hydrophobic foulant attachment hence leading to a sharp tmp jump in the mbr run 3 the ageing of the membrane exposed to 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years of naocl has detrimental impacts on the membrane fouling performance the membranes aged up to 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years of naocl are still able to function as per normal thus it is important to observe the changes in rm which was generally known as constant and to optimize the cleaning processes for membranes with different degrees of chemical cleaning 4 conclusions in this study the impact of naclo ageing on reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes used in mbr application was investigated the following conclusions can be drawn based on the study reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membrane has mechanical properties that are better than non reinforced counterpart and it is not affected by naocl ageing ageing of membrane has impacts on the subsequent fouling performance in mbr system no significant change in performance were observed over 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years of naocl exposure further ageing to 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years of naocl exposure have resulted in a significant increase in clean membrane resistance and increased membrane fouling rates leading to accelerated membrane fouling and failure to perform in mbr application the accelerated fouling rate was found to be caused by the changes in hydrophobicity and membrane pores size and the foulants that were left on the membrane surface after cleaning the permeate quality was not affected greatly by the membrane ageing and the aged membrane was still able to deliver 90 removal of doc and scod after 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years of naocl exposure which suggests the good potential of newly developed reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membrane used in current study

13311,reinforced hollow fiber membranes are commercially available but its information is limited on open literature its notable mechanical properties due to the reinforced layer makes it suitable for membrane bioreactor mbr application on the other hand polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf is an increasingly popular material choice for membrane used in mbr due to its good chemical resistance against chlorine present in sodium hypochlorite naocl which is commonly used as a cleaning agent the impact of naocl on the pvdf membrane characteristics was reported in literature but little information is available about the membrane performance of the aged pvdf membrane caused by naocl in mbr operation in this study the membrane performance of a reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes after naocl ageing were investigated thoroughly in mbr operations a series of characterization on virgin and fouled membranes with without naocl exposure were carried out the accelerated naocl ageing experiments revealed that reinforced hollow fiber membranes have notable mechanical strength which is not significantly affected by naocl ageing as compared to their non reinforced counterpart additionally there was no significant effect on the membrane behaviours in mbr after the membranes were exposed to a 5000 ppm naocl solution at ph 7 for 48 h which is equivalent to 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years naocl exposure using a normal dose of naocl for regular membrane cleaning however after 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years of naocl exposure the membrane failed to perform and a sharp transmembrane pressure tmp increase during mbr operation was observed the severe fouling of aged membranes was found to be attributed to the changes in hydrophobicity pore size and the foulants left on the membrane despite cleaning even though the membrane was fouled quickly after 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years of naocl exposure the permeate quality was not affected much as indicated by 90 removal for dissolved organic carbon doc and soluble chemical oxygen demand scod which suggests that the reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes used in current study exhibit considerable chemical resistance against chlorine and can be used in the mbr system for a long period of operation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pvdf naocl ageing reinforced hollow fiber membrane mbr 1 introduction membrane biological reactor mbr has been increasingly employed for wastewater treatment due to its advantages of better effluent quality smaller footprint higher volumetric loading of sludge lower sludge production and better disinfection capability compared with conventional activated sludge process 1 there is growth in use of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf material for making mbr filtration membranes due to its notable characteristics such as good flexibility 2 and excellent chemical resistance 3 in mbr applications membranes may be exposed to possible damage and breakage by the aeration system or cleaning processes reinforced hollow fiber membranes are highly suitable for mbr operation because of the high mechanical strength from the support layer and the high packing density of the membranes 4 liu et al found that polyethylene terephthalate pet strands reinforced pvdf membranes have mechanical strength improved significantly compared to hollow fiber membranes without reinforcement 5 additionally it was found that commercial pvdf reinforced membranes used in mbr systems have not encountered any hollow fiber breakage issue 6 indicating its notable mechanical strength for use in mbr commercial reinforced hollow fiber membranes have been used widely worldwide in mbr plants in usa china sweden and singapore 4 however the information of reinforced hollow fiber pvdf membrane in mbr application is limited in open literature membrane performance is one of the main concerns of mbr which is affected by membrane fouling due to the increase in foulants being accumulated on the surface and in the pores of the membranes during the filtration leading to decrease in the performance of the membrane over time therefore sodium hypochlorite naocl an oxidant is typically used to clean the membranes in mbr due to its effectiveness of removing organic and biological foulants at a low cost and its availability in the market 7 8 however apart from the removal of foulants on the membrane naocl can interact with the membrane resulting in possible changes in membrane properties and subsequent performance in mbr system and eventually affecting the membrane lifespan 9 11 there are some studies on naocl effects on the pvdf membranes in literature 12 19 one of the focuses was on how naocl affected the hydrophilic additives such as polyethylene glycol peg or polyvinyl pyrrolidone pvp used to promote pore formation during membrane fabrication and membrane s hydrophilicity 12 it was found that the hydrophilic additives could be oxidised by naocl 8 10 the removal of such additives would in turn result in the changes of the membrane characteristics it was reported that membrane hydrophilicity and intrinsic membrane resistance decreased 13 while average membrane pore size increased 14 in contrast an opposite result for membrane resistance was also reported 15 but the method used to age the membranes was different wang et al used a cyclical ageing approach which placed the membranes into continuous filtration and cleaning cycles whereas most other studies used a single soaking method to age the membranes 2 3 12 13 16 the difference in the membrane resistance trend was explained to be due to the difference in irreversible fouling layer in the cyclical aged membranes which caused the increase in membrane resistance however the membrane degradation resulted in pore size increase and caused membrane resistance to decrease in single soaking aged membranes 10 besides the single soaking method is not applicable for real practice in a real application the fouled membranes together with residual foulants on the membrane were exposed to naclo for cleaning periodically the interactions among naclo membrane and foulants are expected to be different with the single soaking of virgin membranes in a naclo solution thus different ageing approaches would result in different membrane properties additionally in real application other operational factors like surface shear by air scouring backwash and fouling can affect the membrane ageing 9 the membrane performance of aged membranes is interesting for mbr operation especially for reinforced hollow fiber membranes but it was not well studied yet therefore the main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of naocl ageing on reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes with respect to their membrane performance in mbr operation which is expected to shed light on the suitability of newly developed reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes used in mbr for wastewater treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 braid reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membranes a pet braid reinforced pvdf hollow fiber membrane supplied by an industrial partner was used for mbr application in the experiment the membrane was fabricated via phase inversion using the non solvent induced phase separation nips technique membrane additives such as pvp and peg were used in the fabrication of the membranes 2 2 membrane characterization the braid reinforced hollow fiber membranes were pre treated using solvent exchange method to remove the preservative on the membrane surface prior to membrane characterization briefly the solvent exchange method consists of soaking the membranes in deionized di water produced by milli q system millipore usa for 24 h followed by soaking for another 24 h in 99 8 ethanol sigma aldrich usa and finally in n hexane sigma aldrich usa for another 3 h the membranes were then removed from the n hexane solution and left to dry in the fume hood for 30 min samples were subsequently kept in a vacuum desiccator until further use the membrane sample morphology was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jsm 7200f jeol japan operating at a voltage of 5 kv a thin layer of platinum was coated on the membrane surface using a sputter coater sc7620 emitech prior to analysis software imagej was used to analyse the surface porosity of the membrane atomic force microscopy afm xe 100 park systems korea was operated in the noncontact mode to obtain the surface microstructures the surface roughness of the membranes was obtained from the afm results and expressed in term of the root mean squared surface roughness r q the pore size distribution and the mean pore sizes of the membranes were measured by capillary flow porometer cfp 1500a porous material inc pmi usa the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and ultimate elongation were measured using a tensile meter instron 3342 instron usa a fourier transform infrared spectroscope with attenuated total reflectance mode atr ftir ir prestige 21 shimadzu japan was used to qualitatively analyse and identify the functional groups present on the surface of the membrane the dynamic contact angle of the hollow fiber membrane s outer surface was measured by a tensiometer dcat11 dataphysics germany prior to measurement the lumen was sealed with epoxy resin and allowed to dry overnight this was done to obtain a higher accuracy of the measurement such that only the outer surface of the membrane was in contact with the di water the membranes were potted in house into a module comprising of 8 hollow fiber strands each of 15 cm in length which resulted in a surface area of approximately 83 cm2 two modules were prepared and tested using di water as feed membrane integrity was confirmed before and after the pure water permeability pwp test the measurement of pwp was conducted at room temperature compaction on the membrane was done under the pressure of 50 kpa for 3 h the pwp was carried out at two different pressures namely 50 kpa and 30 kpa the permeate was subsequently weighted for the pwp calculation 2 3 mbr setup and operating conditions 2 3 1 mbr operation a lab scale mbr as per illustrated in fig 1 with submerged membrane modules were used in this study the two curtain like modules in the reactor contains 23 strands of hollow fibers with 14 cm in length each the total surface area of the modules were approximately 440 cm2 synthetic wastewater composition listed in table 1 were used as the incoming feed for the mbr system activated sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in singapore and acclimated with the synthetic wastewater for 2 weeks before mbr system operation the mbr system was operated continuously based on a constant membrane flux of 25 l m2h it was running with a 10 min cycle consisting of 8 min filtration and 2 min backwash the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were maintained at approximately 2 g l the mbr was operated under hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 h and solid retention time srt of 20 days air was provided for both aeration and air scouring of the membranes for fouling control the aeration rate was set at 2 5 l min the permeate pressure was recorded by digital pressure transmitter ashcroft usa connected to a data logging system labview national instrument usa 2 3 2 chemical cleaning and membrane ageing chemical cleaning was conducted when the transmembrane pressure tmp reached 40 kpa after chemical cleaning the membrane was aged prior to repeating the mbr experiment the experimental flow carried out in this study was summarized and is shown in fig 2 when the membranes were fouled the membranes were cleaned via physical and chemical cleaning physical cleaning refers to cleaning the membrane via pressurized water on the membrane surface to remove big flocs chemical cleaning was conducted by static soaking of membranes in a 1000 ppm of commercial grade naocl 10 wt solution until pwp recovered to at least 80 of the original value prior to fouling chemical cleaning timing was 6 h 38 h and 6 h after mbr runs 1 2 and 3 respectively membrane ageing was carried out with a 5000 ppm of commercial grade naocl solution with ph corrected to 7 using citric acid the membrane modules were soaked in the solution and the solution was recirculated into the membranes using a peristatic pump for 48 h the naocl contact time was calculated using the concentration of the naocl multiplied by the time and expressed in ppm hr the equivalent contact time in years was calculated based on the average total amount of naocl exposure due to maintenance and recovery cleaning in a full scale plant taken from literature 20 wang et al reported the average maintenance cleaning to take place once every month for 2 h using a concentration of 500 ppm naocl while recovery cleaning took place once a year for 18 h using 1500 ppm naocl hence it resulted in an average total naocl concentration exposed to membranes in a year to be equivalent to 40 000 ppm hr in this study including the chemical cleaning the naocl contact time after ageing cycle 1 and ageing cycle 2 was 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years and 524 000 pph hr 13 1 years respectively 2 3 3 membrane resistance calculation the membrane filtration resistance was calculated by darcy equation as shown in eq 1 1 j p μ r t p μ r

standards polysaccharide was measured using the phenol sulfuric acid method 23 with glucose sigma aldrich standards 2 5 fouled membrane autopsy membrane autopsy was conducted for the fouled membranes at the end of the mbr experiments foulants were removed from the membrane surface 8 strands of 14 cm reinforced hollow fiber membranes via soaking the membranes in 40 ml of di water followed by ultra sonicating for 5 min the well mixed foulant solution was then used for analysis of total solids ts volatile solids vs eps and adenosine triphosphate atp atp was measured based on manufacturer s recommendations kikkoman japan another part of the foulant solution was centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 x g and filtered using a 0 45 μm filter dissolved organic fractions was analysed using a liquid chromatography organic carbon detector lc ocd analyzer lc ocd model 8 doc labor germany the remaining foulant solution 20 ml was digested using 1 nitric acid and centrifuged at 4000 x g for 10 min followed by filtration through a 0 45 μm filter the filtered solution was then analysed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer usa for the inorganic elements the biofilm morphology was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica german after the membrane samples were treated with dyes briefly live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes usa were used to stain the biofilm on the membrane surface according to manufacturer s recommendations 2 6 ageing of virgin membranes on top of the mbr experiments five separate sets of small membrane modules were prepared for each of the cleaning and ageing conditions as indicated in fig 2 the membranes were subjected to the same conditions except that the mbr runs were left out at every cleaning or ageing step listed a set of membrane was sampled for the membrane characterization 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of ageing on membrane characteristics table 2 summarizes the membrane characteristics of the reinforced hollow fiber membrane the sem images of the virgin membrane s cross section and membrane surface after ageing are presented in fig 3 a homogeneously reinforced interface was observed between the membrane layer and the reinforced braid which signifies good compatibility between the braid and separation layer 24 naocl ageing caused the surface porosity to increase as evident in the sem images the surface porosity of the membrane after ageing cycle 2 increased by 2 2 times the results are consistent with the other studies which have pvdf aged membranes 12 the atr ftir spectrums of the membrane before and after ageing are shown in fig 4 the peak at 1662 cm 1 found in the membrane is associated with the amide bond vibration from pvp 25 naocl ageing cycle results in a decrease of the peak at 1662 cm 1 which indicates that pvp is degraded and removed from the membrane surface the peak is further decreased when ageing cycle 2 was conducted the decrease in pvp is consistent with results from literature 12 14 the intense peaks at 1402 cm 1 1186 cm 1 1082 cm 1 and 867 cm 1 were identified as characteristic peaks for pvdf membranes 26 no observable change to the characteristic peaks of pvdf membranes after naocl ageing was found indicating that ageing does not have effect on pvdf polymer itself the mechanical properties of the membrane were examined and results are shown in table 3 in comparison to non reinforced hollow fiber membranes the tensile stress at break that reinforced membranes can sustain is 17 2 times greater 54 94 mpa vs 3 2 mpa indicating the pet braid significantly enhance the mechanical strength of hollow fiber pvdf membrane furthermore the mechanical properties of the reinforced hollow fiber membrane were not affected by the naocl ageing and fouling from mbr the tensile stress at break and ultimate elongation remains relatively stable after ageing and fouling indicating its notable mechanical strength however the non reinforced hollow fiber pvdf membrane mechanical properties has been reported to be impacted by naocl ageing especially the elongation of non reinforced membranes after ageing exhibited a sudden reduction from 185 to 120 between the ageing time of equivalent 5 years and 10 years due to naocl resulted changes in chain scission or molecular structure rearrangement in the polymer 27 for reinforced hollow fiber pvdf membranes however the tensile strength were not affected by ageing of the membranes which suggests that the reinforced braids used have strengthened the membrane mechanical property the reinforced pvdf membrane is thus especially suitable for mbr application as process conditions such as air scouring are harsh on the membrane mechanical properties 3 2 impact of pvdf ageing on mbr performance three mbr run cycles were conducted with pvdf membrane ageing after run 1 and run 2 see fig 2 the average mlss concentrations in the mbr was 2 44 g l with a mlvss mlss ratio 0 96 the mbr permeate qualities from three runs are summarized in table 4 the mbr can achieve good removal rates of more than 90 for both doc and scod from the feed water for the membrane aged up to 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years the doc and scod removal rates were comparable with that obtained in the initial stage run 2 vs run 1 however further ageing up to 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years resulted in decrease in the doc and scod removal rates run 3 though the decrease was not dramatic for nh4 n removal most nh4 n were converted to nitrate by microorganisms in mbr the good removal efficiency of doc and nh4 n indicated that the mbrs were in good performance for biological nutrient removal 3 3 impact of pvdf ageing on mbr fouling 3 3 1 tmp profiles of aged pvdf membranes in mbr the tmp profiles for three mbr cycles are shown in fig 5 the membrane can withstand 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years of naocl chemical exposure in the initial stage run 1 the tmp increase rate was 3 23 kpa day compared with the virgin membrane the fouling performance of the reinforced pvdf membrane after 246 000 ppm hr 6 1 years of naocl ageing did not show much difference in terms of average tmp increase rate the tmp increase rate for the membrane used in experiment was approximately two times lower than other reinforced pvdf membrane running at a membrane flux of 15 l m2h which had tmp increase rate of 8 57 kpa day 28 when additional ageing ageing cycle 2 was applied after run 2 equivalent to 524 000 ppm hr 13 1 years of naocl exposure the fouling for the membrane was more severe evidenced by a prompt tmp jump observed the membrane has failed to perform in mbr run 3 due to rapid fouling hollow fiber membrane lifespan in mbr are usually not reported in literature it should exceed 6 years 29 and other study extrapolated membrane life up to 13 years 6 the membrane lifespan tested in the current experiment falls between the values found in literature in addition an extension of chemical cleaning time was required to achieve around 80 recovery of pwp for example the cleaning time of the membranes after mbr runs 1 2 and 3 are 6 h 38 h and 6 h respectively the cleaning time have increased by 6 3 times in the second cleaning cycle compared to the first cleaning indicating higher filtration resistance with aged membranes this result is in line with literature whereby older membranes required longer cleaning period 9 3 3 2 permeability and filtration resistance fig 6 shows the pwp of cleaned fouled membranes in mbr and aged only membranes after the first ageing cycle the aged only membranes exhibited an increase in pwp probably due to the swelling of polymer matrix caused by the oxidiser however the pwp started to decrease after 38 h cleaning and decreased by approximately 30 solely from the effect of ageing cycle 2 the difference in time frame for the drastic decrease between the membranes used in mbr and the aged only membranes is

particulate organics which explains why hydrolysis rate constants reported in literature usually are based on the formation rate of end products such as methane and ammonium however in a previous study we showed that at ph 7 and under methanogenic conditions amino acid fermentation was approximately 5 times slower than hydrolysis of dissolved protein 15 the hydrolysis rate constant and operational conditions mainly the solid retention time srt and ph will affect protein conversion efficiency 22 information on the effect of the srt on protein hydrolysis acidification efficiency and vfa product spectrum in continuous anaerobic systems is limited a number of studies suggested that short srts typically lower than 5 days are economically more favorable but will result in limited conversion 17 23 this would also explain the low vfa product yields ranging from 0 2 to 0 5 g vfa cod per g gelatine or casein cod observed in reactors operated at srts of 5 36 h 16 23 25 more information about the effect of srt and ph is needed to be able to optimize the conversion efficiency for protein rich waste waters in this study we explored the effect of ph and srt on protein degradation with the objective to produce vfas so under non methanogenic conditions for this purpose two continuous stirred tank reactors cstr were inoculated with sludge from an anaerobic reactor treating brewery wastewater the reactors were operated at ph 5 and 7 and at srts of 12 30 days and 6 12 days respectively gelatine a model dissolved protein was fed to the reactors at a concentration of approximately 29 g cod l 1 protein hydrolysis kinetics were determined from cstr measurements and in batch experiments with biomass that was sampled from these cstrs protein degradation was assessed from protein amino acid and vfa concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and substrate characteristics the seed sludge for the two cstrs was obtained from a full scale anaerobic reactor operating under methanogenic conditions and a temperature of 30 3 c treating brewery wastewater the sludge had the following characteristics total suspended solids tss 18 6 0 5 g l 1 volatile

used as a soluble model protein cas no 9000 70 8 sigma aldrich and applied as feedstock solution of 25 1 0 g gelatine equivalent to 28 6 1 2 g cod dissolved in 50 c heated demi water and supplemented with micro nutrients as described in angelidaki et al 26 the feedstocks for each cstr were kept in a water bath of 40 2 c to avoid gelation during feeding into the cstr 27 2 2 continuous experiments the continuous experiments were performed in two double walled plastic cstrs each with a working liquid volume of 20 l and a headspace of 7 l the temperature was kept constant at 35 1 c by a water mantle and water bath as one japan as gelatine concentrations in the cstr were below 2 gelation did not occur at the reactor temperature of 35 c 27 the ph of the feed was 5 3 0 1 the ph in two cstr were controlled at ph 5 0 0 1 and ph 7 0 0 1 with automated hcl 1 n or naoh 1 n addition the reactors were inoculated at an initial biomass concentration of 8 6 g vss l 1 in both reactors 2 bromoethanesulfonate bres 20 mm was added at day 0 to inhibit methanogenic activity and additional doses of bres 10 mm were applied to cstr ph 7 on days 275 360 and 516 the cstrs were operated at different srts according to the schedule in table 1 the reactors were assumed to be in steady state when during at least three consecutive srts the effluent concentrations of protein and vfa gave less than 20 variation the influent and effluent flow rates were set at 5 9 ml min 1 in a 5 minute cycle 1 min on and 4 min off to set a srt of 12 days at the start of the experiments during 600 operational days the srt of the cstr operated at ph 7 was decreased from 12 days to 10 8 6 days and back to 8 10 days the cstr at ph 5 was operated for 480 days and the srt was subsequently increased from 12 to 20 and 30 days the cstrs were sampled from the influent 10 ml and effluent valves 50 ml ph and concentrations of total chemical oxygen demand codtot and protein in the influent were determined two times per week and total nitrogen tn once per month ph total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss codtot cod of the supernatant codsol protein and vfa concentrations in

and analysed once a week 2 3 batch experiments several batch experiments were set up to determine the kinetics of protein hydrolysis by the biomass in the cstrs sampled during steady states at different srts the batch experiments were carried out in triplicate at 35 1 c in 0 23 l serum bottles working liquid volume of 0 15 l continuously shaken at 60 rpm for 240 h the batch medium at ph 7 was adapted from angelidaki et al 26 nh4cl was not added because sufficient nitrogen was already present in the gelatine the medium at ph 5 was identical to that at ph 7 except for na2hpo4 which was replaced with 3 13 g kh2po4 l 1 the biomass was collected from the effluent and was allowed to settle in a beaker for 2 3 days to obtain a concentrated sludge vss above 17 g l 1 the concentrated biomass was added to batch bottles to achieve a working concentration of 2 8 0 2 g vss l 1 dissolved gelatine was added at a concentration of 1 4 0 05 g cod l 1 before the bottles were closed with rubber stoppers and aluminium caps the contents were carefully mixed sampled for initial concentrations and flushed for a short period of time with n2 gas until methane no longer was detected in the head space blanks were prepared containing only biomass inoculum and medium thus without gelatine addition bres 20 mm was added into ph 7 batch bottles to inhibit methane formation also a batch test was conducted with gelatine at ph 5 and ph 7 without inoculum to verify that no chemical hydrolysis of gelatine occurred at 35 1 c in the batch experiments gas 2 ml and liquid samples 4 ml were taken at an interval of 2 3 h during the first 8 10 h subsequently 8 more samples were taken towards the end of the experiment the samples were analysed as described in duong et al 15 a lack of methane production in all bottles showed that methanogenesis was effectively inhibited data not shown 2 4 analyses gas composition ch4 co2 h2 and n2 was quantified by injecting the gas sample in a shimadzu 8a

conditions in both continuous reactors were assured in the batch experiments hydrolysis of protein could be described by a first order model 33 with a linear dependency on the biomass concentration 34 the first order protein hydrolysis rate constants were estimated from the results of the batch experiments with the following equation 6 p hydrolyzed prot t p added prot 1 exp k h batch x t with

similar procedure as applied for the cstrs 3 results and discussion the cod mass balances in the experiments indicated that all important intermediates and products in protein degradation pathways were identified the cod mass balances of the cstrs operated at ph 5 and ph 7 can be found in the supplementary information the gap in the cod mass balances always was less than 10 reactor performance was affected by an unforeseen temperature drop from 35 c to 25 c for 10 days table 1 but recovered from this without having to take operational measures 3 1 protein hydrolysis and acidification at ph 5 and ph 7 the cstrs fig 1 and table 2 for ph 5 fig 2 and table 3 for ph 7 showed different patterns with respect to the degree of hydrolysis and acidification in response to srt and ph in general as expected by the first order kinetics eq 5 a longer srt gave higher sludge concentrations hydrolysis and acidification efficiencies and vfa yields for ph 7 it should be noted however that the vfa yields for the cstr operated at ph 5 of 0 68 0 74 g codvfa g 1codhydrolyzed protein statistically were not different the vfa yield at ph 7 and at srt 12 days of 0 72 g codvfa g 1codhydrolyzed protein did not follow the trend and was lower than expected perhaps this is because cstr operation started at this particular srt fig 2 and full acclimation of the inoculum was not yet achieved after 60 days the average biomass yield of the reactors ranged between 0 08 and 0 13 g codsludge g 1codhydrolyzed protein which is in accordance with values reported by others 16 24 35 for both cstrs from the protein measurements a first order hydrolysis rate constant kh and a minimum srtmin were estimated according to eq 5 fig 3 in spite of the long term exposure of the biomass to ph 5 the estimated hydrolysis rate constant at ph 5 0 05 l g 1vss day 1 was more than 12 times lower than at ph 7 0 62 l g vss 1 day 1 the estimated srtmin to avoid wash out of hydrolytic biomass at ph 7 was 4 4 days a reliable estimation for the minimum srt at ph 5 unfortunately is not available but is expected to be somewhere between 4 4 and 12 days this hydrolysis rate constant for protein at ph 7 0 62 l g vss 1 day 1 is higher than hydrolysis rate constants that were previously found in batch experiment fed with gelatine 0 56 l g vss 1 day 1 15 however these batch experiment were carried out with biomass that was previously fed with substrate not only containing protein but also carbohydrates therefore per gram vss it can be expected to have a lower abundancy of protein degrading microorganisms and a thus a lower specific hydrolysis rate constant obviously the hydrolysis rate for the dissolved gelatine at ph 7 is higher than those found by others for particulate proteins 0 33 l g vss 1 day 1 36 for lower ph the literature provides limited information on first order hydrolysis rate constants for dissolved proteins the average hydrolysis rates for gelatine in this study as well as results from other studies can be found in the supplementary information in general our hydrolysis rate of 0 35 1 08 g codhydrolyzed gelatine g 1vss day 1 at ph 5 were higher than for instance a rate of 0 38 g codhydrolyzed gelatine g 1vss day 1 obtained from upflow reactors operated at ph 5 by yu and fang 25 3 2 concentration of amino acids and rate limiting step for protein degradation at ph 5 and ph 7 fig 4 shows the amino acid composition in the effluent during steady state conditions at ph 5 and an srt of 12 days the total amino acid concentration was 0 31 g cod l 1 fig 4a which is equivalent to 2 of the concentration of hydrolysed protein at srts of 20 and 30 days amino acid concentrations were even lower at ph 7 significantly higher amino acid concentrations were measured in particular at the shorter srts of 6 days 1 68 g cod l 1 and 8 days 3 27 g cod l 1 apparently at the shorter srts hydrolysis of gelatine was faster than conversion of the intermediate amino acids into vfas a phenomenon that was also observed by duong et al 15 at longer srts hydrolysis rather than amino acid conversion became the rate limiting step resulting in much lower amino acid concentrations we do not have an explanation for the higher effluent concentration of amino acids that was observed at srt 8 days compared to srt 6 days at ph 7 the concentration of the different amino acids in the effluent at srt 6 or 8 days fig 4b was proportional to their presence in the gelatine i e glycine and proline valine and methionine the amino acid composition of gelatine is the same as in duong et al 2019 and can be found in the supplementary information this suggests non specific degradation of these individual amino acids during anaerobic degradation of gelatine only alanine at an srt of 8 days was present at higher concentrations than expected e g approximately 63 compared to 8 of alanine in cod composition in gelatine substrate fig s2 si we also observed accumulation of alanine during previous batch tests 15 but do not have a mechanistic explanation for this 3 3 vfa production and spectrum vfa concentrations were measured to assess the vfa yield fig 5 at ph 5 the vfa concentration increased from 8 to 13 g codvfa l 1 when the srt was increased from 12 days to 30 days fig 5a the vfa spectra were nearly similar irrespective of the srt with approximately 33 39 acetate 14 17 propionate 26 30 butyrate and 15 24 valerate this relatively stable vfa spectrum suggests that vfa production pathways did not shift as a response to a changing srt please remark that at ph 5 the concentration of undissociated vfa was as high as 3 1 5 0 g cod l 1 fig 5a which exceeds the inhibitory thresholds of undissociated acids to hydrolysing fermenting bacteria reported by others i e 0 8 g cod l 1 for acetic acid 20 and 0 6 g cod l 1 for propionic acid and butyric acid 37 these undissociated acids can pass the cell membrane and dissociate in the cell as a result bacteria have to spend significant amounts of energy to regulate the ph inside the cell 38 this reduces the growth rate and associated hydrolytic enzyme production and most likely explains the poor performance of the cstr operated at ph 5 compared to the cstr operated at ph 7 with the exception of srt 12 days also at ph 7 the vfa concentrations 5 and 23 g codvfa l 1 increased with the srt fig 5b at this ph the concentration of undissociated vfa is much smaller than at ph 5 resulting in less inhibition and higher vfa concentrations compared to ph 5 however dissociated vfa may still limit protein hydrolysis rates to a certain extent which will be further discussed in section 2 5 unlike at ph 5 the vfa spectra at ph 7 were significantly affected by the srt the proportion of propionate at srts of 6 and 8 days 8 and 5 and n butyrate at srt of 8 days 9 were lower compared to srts 10 and 12 days 9 19 for propionate and 12 22 for n butyrate this can be explained by incomplete degradation of their parent amino acids i e methionine at srts of 6 or 8 days and alanine at srt of 8 days fig 4b comparing the vfa spectra of ph 5 and ph 7 at srt of 12 days shows lower acetate 33 and higher butyrate 26 and valerate 24 proportions at ph 5 than at ph 7 acetate of 47 butyrate of 16 and valerate of 18 although this was not further quantified others have speculated that this can be explained by the lower amount of energy that the microorganisms have to spend on excretion of valerate and butyrate compared to acetate 11 39 3 4 batch tests at lower product substrate concentrations give higher hydrolysis rate to investigate if hydrolysis is inhibited by the relatively high product concentrations in the cstrs batch tests with cstr biomass and a low gelatine concentration 1 4 g cod l 1 were carried out for this purpose sludge was sampled from the reactors during steady state conditions table 4 the first order model of eq 6 could describe hydrolysis of dissolved proteins in all the batch experiments r 0 95 the protein hydrolysis rate constant of the sludge used to inoculate the cstrs was also determined and was 0 39 0 01 l g 1vss day 1 this value is lower than the hydrolysis rate constant in the cstr at ph 7 0 62 l g 1vss day 1 which can be explained by the property of the inoculum that was previously fed with the brewery wastewater containing both protein and carbohydrates as discussed in section 2 2 the hydrolysis rate constants at ph 5 0 14 0 34 l g 1vss day 1 table 4 were 3 6 times higher than the rate constant estimated from the cstr data of 0 05 l g 1vss day 1 most likely this can be explained by the lower vfa concentrations total vfa below 1 6 g cod l 1 in the batch medium the similar batch hydrolysis rate constants at day 393 and day 480 both with sludge sampled at an srt of 30 days suggest that a longer exposure time did not result in acclimation of the biomass to ph 5 we cannot explain why the batch kinetic constants at srts 20 and 12 days 0 14 0 15 l g 1vss day 1 were considerably lower than the values at srt 30 days 0 32 0 34 l g 1vss day 1 at ph 7 batch hydrolysis rate constants ranging between 0 77 and 0 98 l g 1vss day 1 except at srt 6 days were also higher than the rate constant determined from the cstr data of 0 62 l g 1vss day 1 although the difference was not as high as for ph 5 this indicates that high vfa concentrations 1 6 g cod l 1 unpublished data even at ph 7 can inhibit protein hydrolysis although the inhibition mechanisms remain unclear this may be due to the vfas i directly affect the structure of gelatine or the structure or activity of existing protease ii cause suppression of protease production and or iii give reduced growth of protease producing biomass as was reported by gonzález et al 20 3 5 consequences for the design and operation of reactors treating high strength protein wastewaters the results clearly showed that at ph 5 anaerobic protein hydrolysis is supressed and it was not possible to improve hydrolysis by long term exposure of the biomass to this ph as a consequence a very long srt would be needed to achieve an acceptable protein removal and vfa productivity in our research a srt of 12 days would give a maximum productivity of 0 7 g codvfa l 1 day 1 with a very limited protein removal of 42 higher values reported in other studies can be explained by the higher sludge concentrations compared to those in our research 25 and the use of partly already hydrolyzed proteins 16 24 supplement information higher sludge concentrations smaller reactor volumes and higher volumetric vfa productivities are possible by applying sludge retention i e with membrane bioreactors biofilm systems or preferably with granular sludge systems for example yu and fang 25 used an upflow sludge bed reactor with a sludge concentration of 10 8 g vss l 1 and achieved a vfa productivity of 4 2 g codvfa l 1 day 1 from gelatine at ph 5 biomass granulation at ph 5 was demonstrated with glucose as substrate 10 but the question remains if this is also possible for protein rich wastewater in addition future research perhaps should also focus on finding appropriate inocula that are able to grow on protein at low ph the low hydrolysis rate constants at ph 5 probably were caused by the presence of high concentrations of undissociated vfa this can be avoided if the vfa is actively removed from the reactor for example by electrodialysis processes such as proposed by aktij et al 40 at the non inhibitory vfa conditions the hydrolysis rate of protein at ph 5 is expected to increase by 3 6 times to levels comparable to the values found in the batch experiments table 4 this would reduce the reactor volume and make this process more attractive the implementation of such a separation system however would significantly increase the production costs the results of this study clearly showed that protein hydrolysis is much more efficient at ph 7 than at ph 5 therefore maintaining a neutral ph can be one of the effective solutions for harvesting vfa from acid stressed protein containing waste streams i e food processing waste kitchen waste slaughterhouse wastewater cheese waste etc the maximum volumetric vfa productivity at ph 7 of 2 3 g codvfa l 1 day 1 was achieved at an srt of 10 days a srt shorter than 10 days would result in too low a hydrolysis degree and is insufficient to give high vfa productivity at longer srts more protein is converted but the volumetric vfa productivity decreases it should be noted that at srt 10 days with the highest vfa productivity still approximately 8 of the proteins is discharged with the effluent this implies that the optimum srt will largely depend on the purpose of the reactor treating protein rich wastewaters a high removal of protein or a high vfa volumetric productivity furthermore at ph 7 it will be more difficult to prevent methanogenesis in particular at srt of 10 days or longer more research is needed to determine how methanogenic activity can be effectively limited under these conditions 4 conclusions the effect of the solid retention time and ph on dissolved protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation was investigated at ph 5 hydrolysis 0 05 l g 1vss day 1 was more than 12 times slower than at ph 7 0 62 l g 1vss day 1 probably because of the inhibitory effect of undissociated vfa at ph 7 the srt 6 12 days had a significant effect on protein hydrolysis vfa yield and spectrum the optimum volumetric vfa productivity was 2 3 g codvfa l 1 day 1 at srt 10 days complete removal of protein requires a longer srts

13312,anaerobic conversion can be used to recover volatile fatty acids vfa from high strength wastewaters and organic wastes however many waste waters contain considerable concentrations of proteins and knowledge about anaerobic conversion of protein into vfas is limited in this study the effect of the solids retention time srt and ph on dissolved protein conversion into vfas was investigated in completely stirred tank reactors operated at 35 c at ph 5 and with an srt of 12 and 30 days hydrolysis was the rate limiting step of protein degradation at ph 7 and at srt 8 days the system shifted from being limited by hydrolysis to being limited by the conversion of amino acids to vfa even after a long term exposure of the biomass to ph 5 480 days the hydrolysis rate constant for protein 0 05 l g 1vss day 1 was still much lower than at ph 7 0 62 l g 1vss day 1 the difference between ph 5 and ph 7 is explained by the inhibitory effect of the large fraction of undissociated vfa at ph 5 which was confirmed in batch experiments the highest volumetric vfa productivity of 2 3 g cod l 1 day 1 was obtained at ph 7 and at an srt of 10 days for complete removal of protein a longer srt is required

meat and fish processing slaughterhouse cheese whey and beverage wastewaters 1 3 these protein rich waste streams are attractive substrates for anaerobic treatment to generate energy rich methane while simultaneously achieving the objective of pollution control 4 7 alternatively volatile fatty acids vfa can be produced as valuable intermediates of anaerobic degradation processes because they provide chemical building blocks for compounds in the bio based economy such as bioplastics biopolymers in textiles and cleaning agents 8 11 anaerobic conversion of complex biowastes containing mixtures of proteins carbohydrates fats and other compounds has been extensively studied 5 7 12 however the necessary information on how to optimize the first steps in the conversion of proteins i e hydrolysis and fermentation is lacking most hydrolytic acidogenic bacteria have an optimum ph between 5 and 7 13 14 protein hydrolysis is inhibited at low ph e g 4 6 5 5 12 15 but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood several studies suggested a low ph may negatively affect the activity of hydrolytic microorganisms and or of the proteases they produce 16 the strategy of overloading anaerobic reactors with biodegradable cod to enforce a low ph and subsequent inhibition of methanogenesis is often used to obtain vfa from complex organic wastes however little is known about the vfa production efficiency from protein using this strategy 8 the cod content in protein containing food processing wastewaters can be as high as 30 45 g l 1 17 19 and under non methanogenic conditions this could result in inhibition of protein degradation by high concentrations of end products vfas 20 yu and fang 18 found that the acidification degree of milk reduced from 50 to 30 when the cod increased from 4 to 30 g cod l 1 perle et al 21 observed that acclimation of the inoculum sludge could improve solubilization i e hydrolysis of casein at neutral ph in batch tests however it is unknown if hydrolysis can also be improved by long term exposure of biomass to lower ph values hydrolysis is generally considered to be the rate limiting step during anaerobic degradation of particulate organics which explains why hydrolysis rate constants reported in literature usually are based on the formation rate of end products such as methane and ammonium however in a previous study we showed that at ph 7 and under methanogenic conditions amino acid fermentation was approximately 5 times slower than hydrolysis of dissolved protein 15 the hydrolysis rate constant and operational conditions mainly the solid retention time srt and ph will affect protein conversion efficiency 22 information on the effect of the srt on protein hydrolysis acidification efficiency and vfa product spectrum in continuous anaerobic systems is limited a number of studies suggested that short srts typically lower than 5 days are economically more favorable but will result in limited conversion 17 23 this would also explain the low vfa product yields ranging from 0 2 to 0 5 g vfa cod per g gelatine or casein cod observed in reactors operated at srts of 5 36 h 16 23 25 more information about the effect of srt and ph is needed to be able to optimize the conversion efficiency for protein rich waste waters in this study we explored the effect of ph and srt on protein degradation with the objective to produce vfas so under non methanogenic conditions for this purpose two continuous stirred tank reactors cstr were inoculated with sludge from an anaerobic reactor treating brewery wastewater the reactors were operated at ph 5 and 7 and at srts of 12 30 days and 6 12 days respectively gelatine a model dissolved protein was fed to the reactors at a concentration of approximately 29 g cod l 1 protein hydrolysis kinetics were determined from cstr measurements and in batch experiments with biomass that was sampled from these cstrs protein degradation was assessed from protein amino acid and vfa concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum and substrate characteristics the seed sludge for the two cstrs was obtained from a full scale anaerobic reactor operating under methanogenic conditions and a temperature of 30 3 c treating brewery wastewater the sludge had the following characteristics total suspended solids tss 18 6 0 5 g l 1 volatile

with micro nutrients as described in angelidaki et al 26 the feedstocks for each cstr were kept in a water bath of 40 2 c to avoid gelation during feeding into the cstr 27 2 2 continuous experiments the continuous experiments were performed in two double walled plastic cstrs each with a working liquid volume of 20 l and a headspace of 7 l the temperature was kept constant at 35 1 c by a water

and analysed once a week 2 3 batch experiments several batch experiments were set up to determine the kinetics of protein hydrolysis by the biomass in the cstrs sampled during steady states at different srts the batch experiments were carried out in triplicate at 35 1 c in 0 23 l serum bottles working liquid volume of 0 15 l continuously shaken at 60 rpm for 240 h the batch medium at ph 7 was adapted from angelidaki et al 26 nh4cl was not added because sufficient nitrogen was already present in the gelatine the medium at ph 5 was identical to that at ph 7 except for na2hpo4 which was replaced with 3 13 g kh2po4 l 1 the biomass was collected from the effluent and was allowed to settle in a beaker for 2 3 days to obtain a concentrated sludge vss above 17 g l 1 the concentrated biomass was added to batch bottles to achieve a working concentration of 2 8 0 2 g vss l 1 dissolved gelatine was added at a concentration of 1 4 0 05 g cod l 1 before the bottles were closed with rubber stoppers and aluminium caps the contents were carefully mixed sampled for initial concentrations and flushed for a short period of time with n2 gas until methane no longer was detected in the head space blanks were prepared containing only biomass inoculum and medium thus without gelatine addition bres 20 mm was added into ph 7 batch bottles to inhibit methane formation also a batch test was conducted with gelatine at ph 5 and ph 7 without inoculum to verify that no chemical hydrolysis of gelatine occurred at 35 1 c in the batch experiments gas 2 ml and liquid samples 4 ml were taken at an interval of 2 3 h during the first 8 10 h subsequently 8 more samples were taken towards the end of the experiment the samples were analysed as described in duong et al 15 a lack of methane production in all bottles showed that methanogenesis was effectively inhibited data not shown 2 4 analyses gas composition ch4 co2 h2 and n2 was quantified by injecting the gas sample in a shimadzu 8a

connected to a fid detector as described by sudmalis et al 31 amino acids were measured in the supernatant samples as described by meussen et al 32 via high performance liquid chromatography hplc 2 5

influent cod effluent codtot and codsol and cod of fermented products in the effluent including the liquid and off gas to guarantee that the analytical measurements covered all the important compounds in none of the cstrs a significant amount of gas was produced 0 1 0 3 l day 1 and the cod content of the gas hydrogen and methane always was less than 0 1 of the influent cod thus non methanogenic conditions in both continuous reactors were assured in the batch experiments hydrolysis of protein could be described by a first order model 33 with a linear dependency on the biomass concentration 34 the first order protein hydrolysis rate constants were estimated from the results of the batch experiments with the following equation 6 p hydrolyzed prot t p added prot 1 exp k h batch x t with phydrolyzed prot t the cumulative concentration of hydrolyzed protein g cod l 1 after t time days padded prot the concentration of protein g cod l 1 in the batch experiments kh batch the first order

similar procedure as applied for the cstrs 3 results and discussion the cod mass balances in the experiments indicated that all important intermediates and products in protein degradation pathways were identified the cod mass balances of the cstrs operated at ph 5 and ph 7 can be found in the supplementary information the gap in the cod mass balances always was less than 10 reactor performance was affected by an unforeseen temperature drop from 35 c to 25 c for 10 days table 1 but recovered from this without having to take operational measures 3 1 protein hydrolysis and acidification at ph 5 and ph 7 the cstrs fig 1 and table 2 for ph 5 fig 2 and table 3 for ph 7 showed different patterns with respect to the degree of hydrolysis and acidification in response to srt and ph in general as expected by the first order kinetics eq 5 a longer srt gave higher sludge concentrations hydrolysis and acidification efficiencies and vfa yields for ph 7 it should be noted however that the vfa yields for the cstr operated at ph 5 of 0 68 0 74 g codvfa g 1codhydrolyzed protein statistically were not different the vfa yield at ph 7 and at srt 12 days of 0 72 g codvfa g 1codhydrolyzed protein did not follow the trend and was lower than expected perhaps this is because cstr operation started at this particular srt fig 2 and full acclimation of the inoculum was not yet achieved after 60 days the average biomass yield of the reactors ranged between 0 08 and 0 13 g codsludge g 1codhydrolyzed protein which is in accordance with values reported by others 16 24 35 for both cstrs from the protein measurements a first order hydrolysis rate constant kh and a minimum srtmin were estimated according to eq 5 fig 3 in spite of the long term exposure of the biomass to ph 5 the estimated hydrolysis rate constant at ph 5 0 05 l g 1vss day 1 was more than 12 times lower than at ph 7 0 62 l g vss 1 day 1 the estimated srtmin to avoid wash out of hydrolytic biomass at ph 7 was 4 4 days a reliable estimation for the minimum srt at ph 5 unfortunately is not available but is expected to be somewhere between 4 4 and 12 days this hydrolysis rate constant for protein at ph 7 0 62 l g vss 1 day 1 is higher than hydrolysis rate constants that were previously found in batch experiment fed with gelatine 0 56 l g vss 1 day 1 15 however these batch experiment were carried out with biomass that was previously fed with substrate not only containing protein but also carbohydrates therefore per gram vss it can be expected to have a lower abundancy of protein degrading microorganisms and a thus a lower specific hydrolysis rate constant obviously the hydrolysis rate for the dissolved gelatine at ph 7 is higher than those found by others for particulate proteins 0 33 l g vss 1 day 1 36 for lower ph the literature provides limited information on first order hydrolysis rate constants for dissolved proteins the average hydrolysis rates for gelatine in this study as well as results from other studies can be found in the supplementary information in general our hydrolysis rate of 0 35 1 08 g codhydrolyzed gelatine g 1vss day 1 at ph 5 were higher than for instance a rate of 0 38 g codhydrolyzed gelatine g 1vss day 1 obtained from upflow reactors operated at ph 5 by yu and fang 25 3 2 concentration of amino acids and rate limiting step for protein degradation at ph 5 and ph 7 fig 4 shows the amino acid composition in the effluent during steady state conditions at ph 5 and an srt of 12 days the total amino acid concentration was 0 31 g cod l 1 fig 4a which is equivalent to 2 of the concentration of hydrolysed protein at srts of 20 and 30 days amino acid concentrations were even lower at ph 7 significantly higher amino acid concentrations were measured in particular at the shorter srts of 6 days 1 68 g cod l 1 and 8 days 3 27 g cod l 1 apparently at the shorter srts hydrolysis of gelatine was faster than conversion of the intermediate amino acids into vfas a phenomenon that was also observed by duong et al 15 at longer srts hydrolysis rather than amino acid conversion became the rate limiting step resulting in much lower amino acid concentrations we do not have an explanation for the higher effluent concentration of amino acids that was observed at srt 8 days compared to srt 6 days at ph 7 the concentration of the different amino acids in the effluent at srt 6 or 8 days fig 4b was proportional to their presence in the gelatine i e glycine and proline valine and methionine the amino acid composition of gelatine is the same as in duong et al 2019 and can be found in the supplementary information this suggests non specific degradation of these individual amino acids during anaerobic degradation of gelatine only alanine at an srt of 8 days was present at higher concentrations than expected e g approximately 63 compared to 8 of alanine in cod composition in gelatine substrate fig s2 si we also observed accumulation of alanine during previous batch tests 15 but do not have a mechanistic explanation for this 3 3 vfa production and spectrum vfa concentrations were measured to assess the vfa yield fig 5 at ph 5 the vfa concentration increased from 8 to 13 g codvfa l 1 when the srt was increased from 12 days to 30 days fig 5a the vfa spectra were nearly similar irrespective of the srt with approximately 33 39 acetate 14 17 propionate 26 30 butyrate and 15 24 valerate this relatively stable vfa spectrum suggests that vfa production pathways did not shift as a response to a changing srt please remark that at ph 5 the concentration of undissociated vfa was as high as 3 1 5 0 g cod l 1 fig 5a which exceeds the inhibitory thresholds of undissociated acids to hydrolysing fermenting bacteria reported by others i e 0 8 g cod l 1 for acetic acid 20 and 0 6 g cod l 1 for propionic acid and butyric acid 37 these undissociated acids can pass the cell membrane and dissociate in the cell as a result bacteria have to spend significant amounts of energy to regulate the ph inside the cell 38 this reduces the growth rate and associated hydrolytic enzyme production and most likely explains the poor performance of the cstr operated at ph 5 compared to the cstr operated at ph 7 with the exception of srt 12 days also at ph 7 the vfa concentrations 5 and 23 g codvfa l 1 increased with the srt fig 5b at this ph the concentration of undissociated vfa is much smaller than at ph 5 resulting in less inhibition and higher vfa concentrations compared to ph 5 however dissociated vfa may still limit protein hydrolysis rates to a certain extent which will be further discussed in section 2 5 unlike at ph 5 the vfa spectra at ph 7 were significantly affected by the srt the proportion of propionate at srts of 6 and 8 days 8 and 5 and n butyrate at srt of 8 days 9 were lower compared to srts 10 and 12 days 9 19 for propionate and 12 22 for n butyrate this can be explained by incomplete degradation of their parent amino acids i e methionine at srts of 6 or 8 days and alanine at srt of 8 days fig 4b comparing the vfa spectra of ph 5 and ph 7 at srt of 12 days shows lower acetate 33 and higher butyrate 26 and valerate 24 proportions at ph 5 than at ph 7 acetate of 47 butyrate of 16 and valerate of 18 although this was not further quantified others have speculated that this can be explained by the lower amount of energy that the microorganisms have to spend on excretion of valerate and butyrate compared to acetate 11 39 3 4 batch tests at lower product substrate concentrations give higher hydrolysis rate to investigate if hydrolysis is inhibited by the relatively high product concentrations in the cstrs batch tests with cstr biomass and a low gelatine concentration 1 4 g cod l 1 were carried out for this purpose sludge was sampled from the reactors during steady state conditions table 4 the first order model of eq 6 could describe hydrolysis of dissolved proteins in all the batch experiments r 0 95 the protein hydrolysis rate constant of the sludge used to inoculate the cstrs was also determined and was 0 39 0 01 l g 1vss day 1 this value is lower than the hydrolysis rate constant in the cstr at ph 7 0 62 l g 1vss day 1 which can be explained by the property of the inoculum that was previously fed with the brewery wastewater containing both protein and carbohydrates as discussed in section 2 2 the hydrolysis rate constants at ph 5 0 14 0 34 l g 1vss day 1 table 4 were 3 6 times higher than the rate constant estimated from the cstr data of 0 05 l g 1vss day 1 most likely this can be explained by the lower vfa concentrations total vfa below 1 6 g cod l 1 in the batch medium the similar batch hydrolysis rate constants at day 393 and day 480 both with sludge sampled at an srt of 30 days suggest that a longer exposure time did not result in acclimation of the biomass to ph 5 we cannot explain why the batch kinetic constants at srts 20 and 12 days 0 14 0 15 l g 1vss day 1 were considerably lower than the values at srt 30 days 0 32 0 34 l g 1vss day 1 at ph 7 batch hydrolysis rate constants ranging between 0 77 and 0 98 l g 1vss day 1 except at srt 6 days were also higher than the rate constant determined from the cstr data of 0 62 l g 1vss day 1 although the difference was not as high as for ph 5 this indicates that high vfa concentrations 1 6 g cod l 1 unpublished data even at ph 7 can inhibit protein hydrolysis although the inhibition mechanisms remain unclear this may be due to the vfas i directly affect the structure of gelatine or the structure or activity of existing protease ii cause suppression of protease production and or iii give reduced growth of protease producing biomass as was reported by gonzález et al 20 3 5 consequences for the design and operation of reactors treating high strength protein wastewaters the results clearly showed that at ph 5 anaerobic protein hydrolysis is supressed and it was not possible to improve hydrolysis by long term exposure of the biomass to this ph as a consequence a very long srt would be needed to achieve an acceptable protein removal and vfa productivity in our research a srt of 12 days would give a maximum productivity of 0 7 g codvfa l 1 day 1 with a very limited protein removal of 42 higher values reported in other studies can be explained by the higher sludge concentrations compared to those in our research 25 and the use of partly already hydrolyzed proteins 16 24 supplement information higher sludge concentrations smaller reactor volumes and higher volumetric vfa productivities are possible by applying sludge retention i e with membrane bioreactors biofilm systems or preferably with granular sludge systems for example yu and fang 25 used an upflow sludge bed reactor with a sludge concentration of 10 8 g vss l 1 and achieved a vfa productivity of 4 2 g codvfa l 1 day 1 from gelatine at ph 5 biomass granulation at ph 5 was demonstrated with glucose as substrate 10 but the question remains if this is also possible for protein rich wastewater in addition future research perhaps should also focus on finding appropriate inocula that are able to grow on protein at low ph the low hydrolysis rate constants at ph 5 probably were caused by the presence of high concentrations of undissociated vfa this can be avoided if the vfa is actively removed from the reactor for example by electrodialysis processes such as proposed by aktij et al 40 at the non inhibitory vfa conditions the hydrolysis rate of protein at ph 5 is expected to increase by 3 6 times to levels comparable to the values found in the batch experiments table 4 this would reduce the reactor volume and make this process more attractive the implementation of such a separation system however would significantly increase the production costs the results of this study clearly showed that protein hydrolysis is much more efficient at ph 7 than at ph 5 therefore maintaining a neutral ph can be one of the effective solutions for harvesting vfa from acid stressed protein containing waste streams i e food processing waste kitchen waste slaughterhouse wastewater cheese waste etc the maximum volumetric vfa productivity at ph 7 of 2 3 g codvfa l 1 day 1 was achieved at an srt of 10 days a srt shorter than 10 days would result in too low a hydrolysis degree and is insufficient to give high vfa productivity at longer srts more protein is converted but the volumetric vfa productivity decreases it should be noted that at srt 10 days with the highest vfa productivity still approximately 8 of the proteins is discharged with the effluent this implies that the optimum srt will largely depend on the purpose of the reactor treating protein rich wastewaters a high removal of protein or a high vfa volumetric productivity furthermore at ph 7 it will be more difficult to prevent methanogenesis in particular at srt of 10 days or longer more research is needed to determine how methanogenic activity can be effectively limited under these conditions 4 conclusions the effect of the solid retention time and ph on dissolved protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation was investigated at ph 5 hydrolysis 0 05 l g 1vss day 1 was more than 12 times slower than at ph 7 0 62 l g 1vss day 1 probably because of the inhibitory effect of undissociated vfa at ph 7 the srt 6 12 days had a significant effect on protein hydrolysis vfa yield and spectrum the optimum volumetric vfa productivity was 2 3 g codvfa l 1 day 1 at srt 10 days complete removal of protein requires a longer srts

decolourization ftir 1 introduction water pollution due to industrial practices such as paper printing paint textile wool and cotton is one of the world s big issues 1 annually a large amount of highly coloured wastewater is emitted to rivers ponds and channels 2 by lowering the light penetration dye effluents substantially decrease the photosynthetic potential of aquatic plants 3 it also greatly impairs the water quality by changing the ph reducing the dissolved oxygen and increasing the biological oxygen demand 4 moreover in the environment synthetics dyes persist and enter to the food chain the carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of dyes on human and marine life are also suggested in various studies 5 6 overcoming this environmental health problem using suitable strategies to treat dyes effluents is one of the essential objectives to ensure an environmental sustainability for humans and animals several approaches for dye removal from water have been suggested however conventional methods of dyes effluents treatment such as photodecomposition 7 adsorption 8 photo mineralization 9 electrochemical degradation 1 were costly and may create hazardous sludge due to its eco friendly nature and economical cost biological degradation is the best ideal option for environmental remediation using biological processes degradation can be accomplished using phytoremediation 10 enzymatic degradation 11 fungal 12 and bacterial 13 14 biotransformation the extend of biodegradation capabilities of microganisms depends on environmental factors which under optimal conditions will make the process achieved in this way theoretical statistical techniques such as d optimal mixture experimental design and response surface methodology rsm are employed to obtain the optimum conditions and to detect a correlation between variables 15 rsm is a statistical and mathematical technique used for the experimental design modeling and measurement of the effects of different variables 16 17 and it is considered an important method for multivariate optimization to illustrate the optimization process through sequential experimentation 15 rsm s key benefit is the decreased number of laboratory experiments needed to test several variables factors and their relationships 18 it has been used for optimization of reactive blue 19 dye removal 19 photocatalytic degradation of

vibrations concerning ftir spectra of mo extracted metabolites as presented in fig 5b the disappearance of peak at 1640 32 cm 1 and 1455 91 for co and co stretching vibrations this suggests that

dyes by alcaligenes faecalis and bacillus cereus produced similar results in terms of absorption peaks disappearing and new peaks appearing in the ftir spectrum we also noted a significant difference in functional groups observed in ftir examination for non treated and treated cr solution with p ganghwense k3b and this is may be attributed to split and mineralization of aromatic amines into organic acids and aldehydes 38 the comparison of ftir spectrum of non treated and treated cv solutions clearly revealed the biodegradation of parent dye by p ganghwense k3b fig 7 a and b ftir spectra

asymmetric stretching of sulfonic acids 896 cm 1 for ring ch deformations moreover the absence of the peaks at 941 903 and 723 cm 1 in the spectrum of mg degraded solution strongly indicated that p ganghwense k3b mediated biotransformation of the dye solution resulted to degradation of mg and indicated loss of aromaticity or benzene ring the aromatic nature of the compound was confirmed by the presence of absorption bands below 900 cm 1 finally it was confirmed that various hydroxyl functional groups present on the extracted metabolite are bonded to aliphatic and aromatic sites more recently decolourization of mg and cv solution by halo thermotolerant bacteria bacillus subtilis and bacillus licheniformis isolated from hypersaline environments in pakistan has been demonstrated 45 3 4 mathematical modeling and experimental design 3 4 1 selection of parameters impacting the decolourization of dye in artificial seawater using full factorial design from a vast pool of potential methods the full factorial design ffd is an effective screening design for identifying the major factors impacting the biodegradation of industrial coloured effluents recently taguchi experimental design and ffd was used to compare the machinability performance prediction in turning of a titanium alloy 46 ffd is a two level full factorial design and is based on the first order polynomial equation 47 ffd was applied to test the effect of four independent variables nacl concentration peptone concentration temperature and agitation on biodegradation of mg we have selected mg because p ganghwense k3b displayed the best percentage of colour removal 79 61 we found that the decolourization of the tested dye mg is significantly affected by two of the four variables peptone concentration and temperature the experimental data were subjected to multiple regression analysis and fitted to a first order polynomial equation denoted by y 1 y decolourization 47 5 2 85 x1 5 77 x2 3 70 x 3 0 61 x 4 3 86 x 1 x 2 6 93 x 1 x 3 0 59 x 1 x4 1 66 x 2 x 3 0 36 x 2 x 4 3 73 x 3 x 4 3 81 x 1 x 2 x 3 4 36 x 1 x 2 x 4 6 74 x 1 x 3 x 4 0 15 x 2 x 3 x 4 2 95 x 1 x 2 x 3 x4 r2 value obtained in the study was 0 229 which indicates that 22 9 3 were attributed to the independent variables and 77 1 of the total variations were not explained by the model for decolourization of the dye from eq 1 the highest regression coefficient was accomplished by peptone concentration 5 77 followed by the interaction peptone concentration temperature 1 66 3 4 2 analysis of factorial design in a design experiment the major effect plot is useful for illustrating key elements at two or more levels the effect of varying the nacl concentration peptone concentration temperature and agitation on the colour removal and interaction plots for mg removal was presented in fig 9 our data indicates that peptone concentration and temperature decisively affect the decolourization process however nacl concentration and agitation exerted a negative effect on mg decolourization fig 10 also depicted a two factor interaction effect plot which was created by plotting all other variables in order to confirm the significant factors and interactions 48 an interaction plot depicts the effect of modifying one experimental factor s parameters on the other factors because interactions can either enhance or reduce primary effects assessing interactions is important in this investigation the effective interaction between nacl peptone nacl temperature and temperature agitation was proven by interactions between the measured steepest slope of the line graph furthermore the residuals normal probability plots were utilized to verify the data s normality additionally the plots of the residual versus the fit of the residuals were used to verify for constant variance fig 11 in the graphs straight lines show that the residual distribution is normal the lack of patterns on the plot indicated that the constant variance assumption was met as a result the conditions of normality and constant variance were reached our data presented here support the assumptions of normality and constant variance 3 4 3 interaction of surface and contour parts between the major variables the influence of each individual factors and their interactions for the expected responses on the decolourization of mg in asw were investigated using two dimensional contour and three dimensional surface plots figs 12 13 and 14 show the 2d contour and 3d surface plots on decolourization of mg the plots were based on colour removal interaction plots in which one factor was held constant while the other two variables were changed within the experimental range in order to examine the reciprocal interactions between the variables the surface form and its associated contour plot were critical as presented in fig 12 graphical representation indicate the combined effects of peptone concentration and nacl concentration on colour removal while the temperature and agitation were set to have negative effect fig 12 showed clearly that increasing the concentration of peptone might enhance mg decolourisation y suggesting that peptone may play a fondamental role in the decolourization rate of mg in asw graphical representation in fig 13 indicates the combined effects of the temperature and nacl concentration on malachite green decolourization while the peptone concentration and agitation were 2 and zero rpm respectively we also noted that decolourization efficiency y increases as the temperature rises from 30 to 37 degrees celsius as shown by the contour plot as presented in fig 14 the interaction effects of agitation and temperature while the concentration of nacl and peptone were set at their negative levels a mutual increase in agitation and temperature might lead to an increase in mg colouration efficiency y the optimum agitation was found to be between 82 79 and 95 72 additional increase produces a reduction in decolourization rate on the other hand an increase in agitation was critical to the biodegradation process the response surface plot presented a dome shape and the corresponding contour plot showed a dark green coloured diagonally elongated design this imply that the interaction between the dye concentration and ph was significant on dye removal the optimized values of the parameters could be found within these regions 3 4 4 genomic analysis of dyes degrading photobacterium ganghwense the total genome of p ganghwense was assembled in 261 contigs which

kinase 4 hydrolase and 8 transferase enzymes were identified in the genome of the isolated p ganghwense k3b table 5 and some of these enzymes may be responsible for dyes and xenobiotic degradation 51 52 the identified enzyme in the genome of the isolated p ganghwense k3b fig 16 may play a potent role in the enzymatic process associated with decolorization which has been reported to operate with enzyme systems for instance lignin peroxidase laccase tyrosinase and azoreductase of the intracellular and extracellular oxidoreductase enzymes recently arora 51 reported the ability of various species from bacilli genera to biotransform heavy metals and xenobiotic compounds widely used in manufacturing insecticides dyes drugs pesticides herbicides additionally arora and jain 53 identified a marine bacterium bacillus sp mw 1 decolourize 4 chloro 4 nitrophenol used for the synthesis of dyes pesticides via a reduction mechanism in our study 16 dehydrogenases have been identified in the p ganghwense k3b genome according to rathod and collaborators 54 the over expression of the formate dehydrogenase gene in e coli and pseudomonas fluorescens pfo 1 induce the increase of azo dye decolourization by almost 4 fold similarly lei and collaborators 55 noticed that acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may be implicated in the metabolism of toxic aromatic compounds in bacteria recently aldehyde dehydrogenase was identified in in the metaproteome of pseudomonas and burkholderia associated with decolourization of refractory reactive dye black 5 56 moreover li et al 57 has been characterized an aldehyde dehydrogenase in geobacillus thermodenitrificans ng80 2 related to degradation of alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons largely present in crude oils 4 conclusion p ganghwense has been isolated from seawater collected from the jeddah coast the isolated strain displayed a significant ability to remove the colour of four chemical dyes methyl orange congo red crystal violet and malachite green in asw supplemented with 2 w v yeast extract and 7 mm of glucose and the maximum percentage of decolourization was attributed to malachite green 79 61 we also reported in this study the optimization of biodegradation parameters biotic and abiotic factors applied on mg degradation by p ganghwense k3b using full factorial design ffd the full factorial design ffd is a valuable screening method for determining the impact of four independent factors nacl concentration peptone concentration temperature and agitation on biodegradation of mg this method has proven to be an interesting way to find the optimal values for the factors that might influence the decolourization process the results obtained from the experimental design and response surfaces methodology indicated that peptone concentration and ph were the most important factors since they are linked to mg decolourization as a result of this study we can conclude that experimental design and mathematical modeling are useful tools for improving decolorization settings and contributing to a better knowledge of the factors that influence the treatment efficacy of dyes additionally several

decolourization ftir 1 introduction water pollution due to industrial practices such as paper printing paint textile wool and cotton is one of the world s big issues 1 annually a large amount of highly coloured wastewater is emitted to rivers ponds and channels 2 by lowering the light penetration dye effluents substantially decrease the photosynthetic potential of aquatic plants 3 it also greatly impairs the water quality by changing the ph reducing the dissolved oxygen and increasing the biological oxygen demand 4 moreover in the environment synthetics dyes persist and enter to the food chain the carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of dyes on human and marine life are also suggested in various studies 5 6 overcoming this environmental health problem using suitable strategies to treat dyes effluents is one of the essential objectives to ensure an environmental sustainability for humans and animals several approaches for dye removal from water have been suggested however conventional methods of dyes effluents treatment such as photodecomposition 7 adsorption 8 photo mineralization 9 electrochemical degradation 1 were costly and may create hazardous sludge due to its

the ftir spectrum of the product after 24 h of treatment with p ganghwense k3b showed changes in peak as compared to control dye peaks we noticed a reduction in the peaks around 1600 1400 cm 1 fig 6b this is consistent with the cleavage of the nn azo bond 41 the ftir spectra of the obtained products showed some peaks at 3309 cm 1 and 3244 cm 1 supporting stretching of nh group in primary amides

dyes by alcaligenes faecalis and bacillus cereus produced similar results in terms of absorption peaks disappearing and new peaks appearing in the ftir spectrum we also noted a significant difference in functional groups observed in ftir examination for non treated and treated cr solution with p ganghwense k3b and this is may be attributed to split and mineralization of aromatic amines into organic acids and aldehydes 38 the comparison of ftir spectrum of non treated and treated cv solutions clearly revealed the biodegradation of parent dye by p ganghwense k3b fig 7 a and b ftir spectra of the initial solution of crystal violet fig 7a show a peaks at 3319 1636 and 1578 cm 1 for oh co and cc stretching vibrations the peaks at 942 specify nh deformation ftir spectra of cv after

asymmetric stretching of sulfonic acids 896 cm 1 for ring ch deformations moreover the absence of the peaks at 941 903 and 723 cm 1 in the spectrum of mg degraded solution strongly indicated that p ganghwense k3b mediated biotransformation of the dye solution resulted to degradation of mg and indicated loss of aromaticity or benzene ring the aromatic nature of the compound was confirmed by the presence of absorption bands below 900 cm 1 finally it was confirmed that various hydroxyl functional groups present on the extracted metabolite are bonded to aliphatic and aromatic sites more recently decolourization of mg and cv solution by halo thermotolerant bacteria bacillus subtilis and bacillus licheniformis isolated from hypersaline environments in pakistan has been demonstrated 45 3 4 mathematical modeling and experimental design 3 4 1 selection of parameters impacting the decolourization of dye in artificial seawater using full factorial design from a vast pool of potential methods the full factorial design ffd is an effective screening design for identifying the major factors impacting the biodegradation of industrial coloured effluents recently taguchi experimental design and ffd was used to compare the machinability performance prediction in turning of a titanium alloy 46 ffd is a two level full factorial design and is based on the first order polynomial equation 47 ffd was applied to test the effect of four independent variables nacl concentration peptone concentration temperature and agitation on biodegradation of mg we have selected mg because p ganghwense k3b displayed the best percentage of colour removal 79 61 we found that the decolourization of the tested dye mg is significantly affected by two of the four variables peptone concentration and temperature the experimental data were subjected to multiple regression analysis and fitted to a first order polynomial equation denoted by y 1 y decolourization 47 5 2 85 x1 5 77 x2 3 70 x 3 0 61 x 4 3 86 x 1 x 2 6 93 x 1 x 3 0 59 x 1 x4 1 66 x 2 x 3 0 36 x 2 x 4 3 73 x 3 x 4 3 81 x 1 x 2 x 3 4 36 x 1 x 2 x 4 6 74 x 1 x 3 x 4 0 15 x 2 x 3 x 4 2 95 x 1 x 2 x 3 x4 r2 value obtained in the study was 0 229 which indicates that 22 9 3 were attributed to the independent variables and 77 1 of the total variations were not explained by the model for decolourization of the dye from eq 1 the highest regression coefficient was accomplished by peptone concentration 5 77 followed by the interaction peptone concentration temperature 1 66 3 4 2 analysis of factorial design in a design experiment the major effect plot is useful for illustrating key elements at two or more levels the effect of varying the nacl concentration peptone concentration temperature and agitation on the colour removal and interaction plots for mg removal was presented in fig 9 our data indicates that peptone concentration and temperature decisively affect the decolourization process however nacl concentration and agitation exerted a negative effect on mg decolourization fig 10 also depicted a two factor interaction effect plot which was created by plotting all other variables in order to confirm the significant factors and interactions 48 an interaction plot depicts the effect of modifying one experimental factor s parameters on the other factors because interactions can either enhance or reduce primary effects assessing interactions is important in this investigation the effective interaction between nacl peptone nacl temperature and temperature agitation was proven by interactions between the measured steepest slope of the line graph furthermore the residuals normal probability plots were utilized to verify the data s normality additionally the plots of the residual versus the fit of the residuals were used to verify for constant variance fig 11 in the graphs straight lines show that the residual distribution is normal the lack of patterns on the plot indicated that the constant variance assumption was met as a result the conditions of normality and constant variance were reached our data presented here support the assumptions of normality and constant variance 3 4 3 interaction of surface and contour parts between the major variables the influence of each individual factors and their interactions for the expected responses on the decolourization of mg in asw were investigated using two dimensional contour and three dimensional surface plots figs 12 13 and 14 show the 2d contour and 3d surface plots on decolourization of mg the plots were based on colour removal interaction plots in which one factor was held constant while the other two variables were changed within the experimental range in order to examine the reciprocal interactions between the variables the surface form and its associated contour plot were critical as presented in fig 12 graphical representation indicate the combined effects of peptone concentration and nacl concentration on colour removal while the temperature and agitation were set to have negative effect fig 12 showed clearly that increasing the concentration of peptone might enhance mg decolourisation y suggesting that peptone may play a fondamental role in the decolourization rate of mg in asw graphical representation in fig 13 indicates the combined effects of the temperature and nacl concentration on malachite green decolourization while the peptone concentration and agitation were 2 and zero rpm respectively we also noted that decolourization efficiency y increases as the temperature rises from 30 to 37 degrees celsius as shown by the contour plot as presented in fig 14 the interaction effects of agitation and temperature while the concentration of nacl and peptone were set at their negative levels a mutual increase in agitation and temperature might lead to an increase in mg colouration efficiency y the optimum agitation was found to be between 82 79 and 95 72 additional increase produces a reduction in decolourization rate on the other hand an increase in agitation was critical to the biodegradation process the response surface plot presented a dome shape and the corresponding contour plot showed a dark green coloured diagonally elongated design this imply that the interaction between the dye concentration and ph was significant on dye removal the optimized values of the parameters could be found within these regions 3 4 4 genomic analysis of dyes degrading photobacterium ganghwense the total genome of p ganghwense was assembled in 261 contigs which contain 5 340 291 bp gc content of 50 7 the genome coverage was 123 the n50 and l50 were 53 549 and 30 respectively the sequences were submitted to genbank under the accession jahrdw000000000 the phylogenetic analysis of the selected dyes degrading strain k3b has a tight taxonomic relationship with members of the photobacterium genus particularly p ganghwense dsm22954 fig 15 pgap genome

whole genome many of these enzymes described have other functions in addition to their essential role in metabolic and cell growth table 5 different cytochrome enzymes were identified in p ganghwense among them are cytochrome c which has decolourization activity on malachite green as previously demonstrated 49 according to kim and collaborators 49 a novel c type cytochrome cecyt was involved in the decolourization of mg and coomassie brilliant blue r 250 in the mitochondria of the zygomycete fungus cunninghamella elegans also cytochrome p450 may catalyzes the reduction of molecules containing quinones azo halogenated nitro n hydroxy and hydroperoxide functional groups in a few uncommon reactions 50 according to ncbi and patric annotation 8 reductase 16 dehydrogenase 7 oxidase 4 kinase 4 hydrolase and 8 transferase enzymes were identified in the genome of the isolated p ganghwense k3b table 5 and some of these enzymes may be responsible for dyes and xenobiotic degradation 51 52 the identified enzyme in the genome of the isolated p ganghwense k3b fig 16 may play a potent role in the enzymatic process associated with decolorization which has been reported to operate with enzyme systems for instance lignin peroxidase laccase tyrosinase and azoreductase of the intracellular and extracellular oxidoreductase enzymes recently arora 51 reported the ability of various species from bacilli genera to biotransform heavy metals and xenobiotic compounds widely used in manufacturing insecticides dyes drugs pesticides herbicides additionally arora and jain 53 identified a marine bacterium bacillus sp mw 1 decolourize 4 chloro 4 nitrophenol used for the synthesis of dyes pesticides via a reduction mechanism in our study 16 dehydrogenases have been identified in the p ganghwense k3b genome according to rathod and collaborators 54 the over expression of the formate dehydrogenase gene in e coli and pseudomonas fluorescens pfo 1 induce the increase of azo dye decolourization by almost 4 fold similarly lei and collaborators 55 noticed that acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may be implicated in the metabolism of toxic aromatic compounds in bacteria recently aldehyde dehydrogenase was identified in in the metaproteome of pseudomonas and burkholderia associated with decolourization of refractory reactive dye black 5 56 moreover li et al 57 has been characterized an aldehyde dehydrogenase in geobacillus thermodenitrificans ng80 2 related to degradation of alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons largely present in crude oils 4 conclusion p ganghwense has been isolated from seawater collected from the jeddah coast the isolated strain displayed a significant ability to remove the colour of four chemical dyes methyl orange congo red crystal violet and malachite green in asw supplemented with 2 w v yeast extract and 7 mm of glucose and the maximum percentage of decolourization was attributed to malachite green 79 61 we also reported in this study the optimization of biodegradation parameters biotic and abiotic factors applied on mg degradation by p ganghwense k3b using full factorial design ffd the full factorial design ffd is a valuable screening method for determining the impact of four independent factors nacl concentration peptone concentration temperature and agitation on biodegradation of mg this method has proven to be an interesting way to find the optimal values for the factors that might influence the decolourization process the results obtained from the experimental design and response surfaces methodology indicated that peptone concentration and ph were the most important factors since they are linked to mg decolourization as a result of this study we can conclude that experimental design and mathematical modeling are useful tools for improving decolorization settings and contributing to a better knowledge of the factors that influence the treatment efficacy of dyes additionally several

13314,the ballasted flocs exhibit distinct transition characteristics due to their hybrid internal structure porous coagulated suspended particles and solid ballast proportions and compact aggregation the drag force exerted on a ballasted floc in fluid medium is distinct from conventional flocs due to less internal resistances partially impermeable structure and compact aggregation incorporating properties of ballasted floc shape porosity permeability ballasted proportion transition regime condition can lead to precise determination of drag coefficient cd in previous ballasted flocculation bf studies researchers adopted cd 24 re which is a generalized equation and is limited to spherical objects in laminar regime however because of the non spherical shape hybrid floc structure having porous and solid proportions and the non laminar transition of ballasted flocs the drag coefficient can be underestimated in this study a deterministic drag model is proposed for ballasted flocs which corresponds to the real time regime condition and the ballasted floc characteristics the equation incorporates the floc shape characteristics degree of sphericity and the floc composition characteristics porosity permeability ballast embedment ratio that influence the drag force applied during floc transition the evaluation of model predictions with real time ccd camera based floc size and settling velocity observations from previous studies revealed that the proposed model is most suitable approach r2 0 83 to determine drag coefficient of ballasted flocs this can lead to efficient designing of ballasted flocculation facilities graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords drag coefficient ballasted flocs floc shape floc composition reynolds number 1 introduction the relative motion between an object and its surrounding fluid leads to normal and shear stresses exerted on the object from surrounding fluid the surface integral of all these stresses is denoted as drag force fd 1 to ease the determination of drag force a dimensionless drag coefficient cd is introduced exhibiting drag force per unit projected area size of sphere having equivalent surface area to object under evaluation depends only on reynolds number re according to most of the previous studies 2 the downward movement of the object is dependent on the object properties size shape porosity permeability and fluid properties newtonian or non newtonian 3 settling of particles in fluid medium is objective of many processes and engineering applications therefore study of drag phenomenon applied on settling objects is crucial 4 the precise evaluation of drag coefficient cd is imperative for accurate determination of the terminal settling velocity of vertically falling particles 5 the absence of any general solution lead to many empirical and semi empirical correlations quantifying the relationship between cd and re reynolds number associated with different veracities and validation ranges for spherical regular e g cylinder ellipsoid cube and irregular shapes 6 due to the complexity of shape characterization many studies dealing with particulate flows used spheres and regular shapes for experimental studies or assumed irregularly shaped particles as perfect spheres for model development 7 in the past few decades however many shape descriptors were introduced in particulate flow studies such as roundness sphericity irregularity ratio of longest to shortest dimension and the ratio of particle surface area to the equivalent sphere area to evaluate the irregularly shaped particles 8 the most widely adopted cd models in coagulation studies are based on studies of regular shaped particles 2 arbitrarily shaped flocs during transition in water experience momentum on all coordinate axis 9 in coagulation studies the force exerted opposite to particle motion fd drag force is considered as most important to comprehend because it hinders solid liquid separation which is the core objective of the bf ballasted flocculation process 10 the fd is quantified in model development by a dimensionless number cd exhibiting resistances of flocs during transition in water 11 many researchers modelled cd as a function of re by empirical relationships based on experimental data of regular shaped particles due to absence of any deterministic model 2 thus the developed models do not incorporate accurate characterization of particle size shape composition and are limited to a certain re range so it is important to develop a general cd model that not only quantifies size shape and composition of arbitrarily shaped ballasted flocs in unified manner but also applicable to wide range of re the flocs aggregated in conventional coagulation process are porous and fragile due to loose aggregation of suspended solids 41 the water passage from internal floc structure lead to high internal resistances translated to higher drag force during transition of conventional flocs however ballasted flocculation is advanced coagulation phenomenon in which high specific gravity ballast media is injected during coagulation which is embedded in internal floc structure during aggregation to form ballasted flocs 12 the ballast collisions with coagulated suspended particles under applied agitation lead to compact floc formation 13 therefore ballasted flocs exhibit hybrid characteristics due to porous and solid proportions which reflect the aggregation of ballast particles with chemical floc matrix high density and inertia compact formation and distinct settling pattern compared to flocs aggregated in conventional coagulation process 14 the high density of aggregated ballasted flocs is translated into dominance of inertial force over viscous forces during transition and exhibits higher reynold number re value compared to conventional flocs so the ballasted flocs usually follow the transitional flow regime 1 re 103 compared to conventional flocs which follow laminar transition re 1 15 the embedment of ballast in internal structure of ballasted flocs hinders water passage leading to less internal resistances translated to less drag force exerted during transition in water medium due to differences in composition transition condition and infinite number of irregular shapes the previously developed models were unable to predict the cd for ballasted flocs therefore it is essential to develop a cd model incorporating the ballasted floc properties in the present study a deterministic approach was used to develop a general cd model for ballasted flocs by incorporating parameters for quantification of influencing factors shape porosity permeability and ballast proportion the proposed model was evaluated corresponding to experiment based cd observations concurrent real time size and velocity observations of ballasted flocs using ccd camera translated to experimental cd observations using stokes law from several studies table 1 and recently reported cd re correlations the model exhibited higher r2 value 0 83 during simulation with experiment based cd observations compared to recently reported cd re correlations under investigation therefore the developed model can be adopted as suitable approach for drag determination of ballasted flocs leading to efficient treatment facility design 2 a review of recently developed drag coefficient models it has been a challenge for scientists and researchers to develop a cd re correlation applicable to entire subcritical flow conditions re 200 000 equally applicable to all types of particle flow applications in the fields of fluid mechanics mechanical engineering chemical engineering and environmental engineering 11 many researchers developed the empirical cd re correlation by experimental data fitting using regression analysis to a presumed mathematical expression 16 most of the experimental cd re direct observations were performed using solid particles with regular shapes which leads to development of models applicable to regularly shaped particles 17 however most engineering applications work with irregular shaped particle flow and developed models underestimate the cd observations of irregular shaped objects some researchers proposed indirect empirical cd re correlations by presuming mathematical expressions including an overview of shape descriptors for irregularly shaped particles for precise cd predictions of regular and irregular shaped particles 18 over the last decade many researchers proposed empirical cd re relationships to predict the standard drag curve for regular and irregularly shaped particles in this study five recently developed cd re models exhibited in table 2 along with range of applicability were evaluated in comparison to the predications of cd model proposed in this study benchmarking the experiment based cd re observations the morrison 2013 model was developed using piecewise matched procedure to cover the transition from laminar to turbulent region 19 terfous et al developed cd re relationship using the simple series function and the least squares method 20 however this model is limited to re of 0 1 replacing traditional term 24 re with 21 683 re the barati et al as based on a multi gene genetic programming gp procedure to precise cd re correlation prediction from low to complete subcritical flow conditions re up to 106 21 gp have an advantage over other empirical model development methods to determine the structure and parameters of model simultaneously compared to other methods where structure of model is user defined and parameters are assigned by regression analysis bagheri and bonadonna 22 developed a cd re relationship based on the particle reynolds number alongwith two shape descriptors defined as a function of particle flatness elongation and diameter 22 the new shape descriptors introduced in this model were easy to measure and characterize in this model the effect of orientation of transiting particles on cd was evaluated in addition to predict the end members of cd due to change in the particle orientation model established by hongli et al 39 was based on a series of cd re relationships of spherical particles based on stokes law the oseen law and the goldstein law and 480 experimental data groups 23 the presumed rational function exhibited in table 2 was found effective containing re as only dependent variable to explicate the cd re correlation for a wide re range this new developed model exhibited higher degree of correlation with experimental datasets over wide re range the above mentioned models were developed based on regression analysis between experimental observations and presumed or computed cd re correlations building on the previous developed models from simple mathematical expressions to complex functions with re being the prime parameter for cd determination in the field of ballasted flocculation the experimental observations revealed that cd is dependent on many functions shape orientation transition regime condition ballast function porosity permeability and ballasted flocculation operational conditions depending on characteristics of aggregated flocs 9 therefore the empirical cd re correlations developed in previous studies found suitable in conventional floc studies were unable to explicate the impact of all abovementioned characteristics at determined cd values for ballasted flocs 24 25 fig 1 differentiates the transition mechanism of conventional and ballasted flocs in conventional flocs the normal stresses ns shear stresses ss and internal resistances ir are higher compared to ballasted flocs due to fragile and porous nature of conventional flocs leading to higher exerted drag force fd ns ss ir during floc transition 9 drag coefficient drag forces fd exerted per unit projection area ap is therefore higher compared to ballasted flocs on the other hand ballasted flocs exhibit less internal resistances ir due to hindrance of water passage from internal floc structure because of nonporous ballast embedment moreover compact aggregation of ballasted flocs due to ballast collisions with suspended solids leads to less exerted normal and shear stresses which is translated to less applied drag force per unit projection area during ballasted floc transition in water medium 26 in addition ballasted flocs exhibit higher reynolds number re ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces due to dominance of inertial forces due to embedment of high specific gravity ballasts with suspended solids compared to low density conventional flocs it is important to accommodate abovementioned properties of distinct natured ballasted flocs to determine the drag coefficient therefore it is imperative to develop a cd model based on characteristic of ballasted flocs to predict the cd re trend in the field of ballasted flocculation the model can be extended to precise determination of settling velocity of ballasted flocs leading to efficient bf facility design 27 3 development of drag coefficient model for ballasted flocs the objective of this study was to develop a precise correlation for drag coefficient determination of ballasted flocs with a wide range of applicability which can be a useful tool for designing of ballasted flocculation bf facility therefore a deterministic approach was used for model development in this study in various studies drag coefficient cd was reported as influenced by certain properties of flocs such as flow condition and orientation of floc in the flow stream shape porosity permeability and ballast content in the case of ballasted flocs 12 18 25 based on observations of previous studies following parameters were identified to be incorporated in development of deterministic cd model 1 c d f re θ η ω ε where re reynolds number transition regime condition θ shape descriptor of flocs degree of sphericity of flocs ε function of ballasted floc structure ballast content in the floc aggregation η porosity of aggregated floc ω floc permeability it was important to identify the relationships of all abovementioned parameters with cd for ballasted flocs the determination of these correlations can lead to development of a comprehensive cd model 3 1 reynolds number re is a dimensionless number indicating the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces of a ballasted floc in fluid medium re of a vertically settling floc in a water medium can be determined by deterministic eq 2 2 re ρ w d f v f μ where d f size of floc v f settling velocity of floc ρ w density of water μ absolute viscosity of water many researchers plotted experimental size and velocity based re observations against cd and exibited the correlation of inverse proportionality between cd and re as shown in eq 3 2 9 3 c d a re b where a balancing coefficient can be calibrated by experimental observations b slope of the cd re curve can be determined by experimental observations in the case of ballasted flocs eq 3 can be transformed to eq 4 by introducing a coefficient based on eq 1 exhibiting other factors shape floc structure porosity and permeability influencing the drag coefficient of ballasted flocs it was imperative to study the effect of each influencing parameter individually on the drag coefficient of ballasted flocs for the development of comprehensive cd model 4 c d a re b f θ ε η ω 3 2 floc shape the ballasted flocs being arbitrarily shaped particles the drag force is exerted on all three axes during their vertical downward movement in a water medium the spherical shaped particles experience less drag force compared to similar sized irregularly shaped particles 14 18 the previous researchers used spherical particles or an assumption of particle sphericity for the development of drag coefficient models however the developed models underestimated the drag coefficient for ballasted flocs which are composed of infinite number of arbitrary shapes in the last decade many shape descriptors were introduced to study the arbitrary shaped particles in unified manner 14 28 30 the shape descriptor quantifying particle s degree of sphericity eq 5 was adopted in this study 31 to model infinite no of irregular shapes of ballasted flocs in unified manner 5 θ 4 π a f p f 2 where a f area of ballasted floc p f perimeter of ballasted floc the value of this shape descriptor equals 1 for completely spherical particles the previous studies reported relationship of inverse proportionality between sphericity and drag coefficient of aggregated flocs this relationship was adopted for ballasted flocs to incorporate the shape effect in drag coefficient model 6 c d 1 θ 3 3 floc structure the ballasted flocs exhibit hybrid characteristics due to dual structure composed of solid and porous proportions of ballasts and coagulated colloidal substances respectively 12 the ballasted flocs experience less drag force due to less internal resistances resulted by inability of water passage from impermeable solid proportion and compact coagulated suspended substances of floc as exhibited in fig 1 therefore the ballast content in floc aggregation has inverse proportionality with drag coefficient eq 7 it is important to determine the ballasted content in the structure of aggregated floc for drag coefficient modeling lapointe and barbeau 2016 introduced a model eq 8 to determine density of ballasted floc based on ballasted and non ballasted proportions of floc 14 by reorganizing that model eq 8 to eq 9 it can be adopted to determine the ballast fraction in aggregated floc 12 the introduction of ballast content in the cd model can lead to precise determination of drag coefficient of a ballasted floc 7 c d 1 ε 8 ρ f ρ b ε ρ cfm 1 ε 9 ε ρ f ρ cfm ρ b ρ cfm where ρ f density of floc ρ cfm density of coagulated colloidal substances ρ b density of employed ballast ε ballast fraction in the aggregated floc 3 4 floc porosity the internal floc structure controls the extent of advective flow and hence the corresponding hydrodynamic drag force exerted on the floc during settling according to the previous studies the extent of advective flow through the flocs depends upon the particle s packing pattern and available pore spaces among aggregated particles to constitute a floc 32 the fraction of floc volume composed of pores is called floc porosity the floc porosity is measured through the mass balance function as ratio of effective floc density density difference between floc and water to the effective density of suspended particles density difference between suspended particles and water which constitute a floc as explicated in eq 10 32 10 1 η ρ f ρ w ρ s ρ w where ρ f density of floc ρ w density of water ρ s density of colloidal particles in suspension η porosity of aggregated floc fraction of voids 1 η fraction of coagulated particles and ballasts in the aggregated floc as pore fraction increases in the floc it experiences higher drag force due to higher internal resistance caused by fluid passage from within the floc structure therefore η is directly proportional to drag coefficient as exhibited in eq 11 11 c d η 3 5 floc permeability in addition to floc porosity floc permeability is another important factor that controls the extent of advective flow from within the floc 33 floc permeability is defined as pore interconnectedness in the floc and measured as amount of water flow from the floc interior distance time and referred as hydraulic conductivity of floc 34 in ballasted flocs the ballast fraction of floc is considered as impermeable proportion while the fraction of aggregation of suspended solids is considered as permeable proportion the permeable proportion allows water passage from within the floc structure the enhanced internal resistances due to higher permeable fraction in floc structure exhibited direct proportionality with drag coefficient as exhibited in eq 12 therefore permeable fraction of floc was incorporated in this model which was computed by eq 13 35 12 c d ω 13 ω 1 ε where ω represents the permeable fraction in floc and is measured by the difference of ballast fraction in floc ε from the total floc volume 3 6 proposed drag coefficient model the following drag coefficient equation eq 14 was proposed for ballasted flocs in this study incorporating the function for floc transition in a fluid medium eq 3 floc shape eq 6 ballast effect eq 7 ballast content in floc structure eq 11 and permeable fraction of internal floc structure eq 12 in eq 4 14 c d aηω re b θε eq 14 can be simplified by substituting eqs 5 9 10 and 13 to develop a comprehensive and effective drag coefficient model

determination of balancing coefficients of proposed drag model the proposed model was dependent on two balancing coefficients a b and it was important to determine and quantify the dependency of balancing coefficients a b corresponding to characteristics of ballasted flocs therefore 7000 real time size and velocity observations of ballasted flocs and real time images of floc projection from five different studies in which ccd camera based image analysis process was adopted for concurrent floc size and settling velocity determination explicated in table 1 were used to compute the experiment based cd observations using stokes law exhibited in eq 16 9 12 36 38 the floc density inserted in eq 16 was computed by using a size density correlation modified tambo and watanabe model

experiment based size and velocity observations and x exhibits the experiment based values determined using x function 36 the values of a b coefficients were computed at best fitting of x function corresponding to experimental re values exhibiting an adjusted r2 value of 0 81 as explicated in fig 2 the determined values of a b coefficients were substituted in eq 15 to develop a cd model eq 16

applied drag force during floc transition 12 therefore the experiment based floc cd observations determined using studies of table 1 were classified corresponding to ballast type and applied g value during mixing classifications w r t applied ballast type and mixing conditions corresponding to adopted studies are exhibited in table 1 to quantify the impact of applied ballast characteristics and applied velocity gradient on drag coefficient of aggregated flocs the normal distribution curve of experiment based cd observations corresponding to ballast type classification fig 3 a exhibited that drag coefficient of ballasted flocs is inversely proportional to density of applied ballasts 9 the high density ballasts transform to high density compact flocs due to suspended solids collisions with high density ballasts leading to floc compaction this embedment of high density ballasts in floc structure leads to high inertial forces and compact aggregation of ballasted flocs leads to lower internal resistances during floc transition which is collectively translated into lower applied drag force at vertically settling flocs therefore density of applied ballast can be a decisive parameter to compute a b coefficients of eq 15 similarly the normal distribution curve of classified experiment based cd observations based on applied conditions in adopted studies for aggregation mentioned in table 1 corresponding to applied g value fig 3 b im refers to instant mix rm refers to rapid mix and sm refers to slow mix during aggregation in fig 3 b exhibited that with higher applied g value ballasted flocs with lower cd values can be aggregated the applied g value is decisive parameter of floc growth and floc compaction in ballasted flocculation as exhibited in fig s1 of supplementary information and further elaborated in section s1 of appendix a supplementary data and therefore its crucial impact is expected in quantification of a b coefficients of eq 15 12 the experiment based cd observations from adopted studies table 1 classified corresponding to ballast type and applied velocity gradient aggregation conditions used in studies elaborated in table 1 were passed through user defined non linear curve fitting corresponding to eq 15 following the above mentioned procedure and values of a b were recomputed for each classified dataset to the datasets applied normal distribution in fig 3 individually the results determined values for a b for each individual dataset are mentioned in fig 3 a and b revealed that the coefficient a is function of applied ballast density and applied g value with its value varying from 15 94 21 94 corresponding to varied density ballasts and varied applied g value therefore a function can be developed to predict value of a based on applied ballast condition and applied velocity gradient conditions however an insignificant variation was observed in the case of coefficient b exhibiting b as a factor exhibiting the slope of cd re curve as slope of cd re curve exhibited insignificant change for individual datasets based on applied ballast type and applied g value 5 evaluation and comparison of proposed model with recently developed drag models the predictions of proposed cd model plotted corresponding to model based re values floc size re correlation proposed by qasim et al 2020 and compared with experiment based cd observations from studies of table 1 plotted against experimental re values determined by eq 2 using experiment based size and velocity observations are exhibited in fig 4 b the experiment based cd values corresponding to experimental re exhibited a prominent cd re trend of inverse proportionality the model exhibited a significant correlation with experimental cd observations exhibiting r2 value of 0 83 moreover the major proportion of experiment based cd observations corresponding to model predictions exhibited that ballasted flocs exhibit a slight deviation from standard cd re curve as exhibited in fig 4 a this can be due to hybrid internal structure of ballasted flocs composed of solid ballasts and porous coagulated suspended solids leading to a distinct transition phenomenon during vertical settling the ballasted flocs exhibit higher re values compared to conventional flocs due to dominance of inertial forces over viscous forces as a result of ballast embedment in floc aggregation moreover the compact formation of aggregates and ballast particles in internal floc structure block the internal pores of aggregated flocs fig 1 leading to hindrance of water passage from internal floc structure during its downward transition in water column this hinderance of water passage is translated to lower internal resistances compared to conventional flocs reducing overall drag force applied at ballasted flocs therefore ballasted flocs exhibit a distinct transition phenomenon and superficial settling compared to conventionally aggregated flocs therefore the application of previously developed cd re correlations can underestimate the cd predictions for ballasted flocs to further investigate the significance of proposed cd model eq 16 compared to experiment based cd observations a linear regression analysis was performed between experiment based cd observations and cd model predictions the r2 value in linear regression exhibits the degree of correlation of experimental observations to the model predictions the resulted graph fig 5 a exhibited a significant correlation 0 84 between experiment and model based cd values moreover the model based cd re predictions in this study were compared with recently developed cd re correlations table 2 benchmarking the experiment based cd re observations as exhibited in fig 5 b the results revealed that model proposed in this study exhibited a significant overlap r2 0 83 to the trend of experiment based cd re observations the model developed by barati et al exhibited a partial agreement with r2 0 58 following the model proposed in this study 21 the other models in comparison exhibited a partial agreement with trendline following the barati et al 2014 slightly overestimating the experiment based cd observations at major proportion of experimental scatter corresponding to re value of 10 100 19 20 22 the model developed by hongli et al 2015 exhibited a higher overestimation compared to other models under investigation 23 the reason can be the hybrid nature of ballasted flocs leads to distinct drag and transition phenomenon therefore it was concluded that model proposed in this study is capable to precisely predict the cd values for ballasted flocs compared to recently developed cd re correlations therefore the proposed model eq 15 can be adopted for cd prediction of ballasted flocs and can be very useful in designing the ballasted flocculation treatment facilities 6 conclusion in most of the previous studies the drag coefficient was empirically modelled with only one function re using experimental observations of regular shaped objects however drag coefficient is dependent on drag force which is a complex phenomenon and is dependent on characteristics of transiting object shape porosity permeability transition regime condition and characteristic of surrounding fluid newtonian or non newtonian the application of previously developed empirical cd re correlations in the field of ballasted flocculation can lead to underestimation or overestimation of drag coefficient due to hybrid nature porous and solid proportions in internal structure and distinct transition characteristics due to hybrid internal structure of ballasted flocs therefore it was imperative to develop a deterministic natured cd re model for ballasted flocs for precise drag determination of ballasted flocs in this study a deterministic cd re model was proposed based on characteristics of ballasted flocs shape porosity permeability transition condition and rate of ballast embedment the developed model was simulated with real time ballasted floc observations from previous studies for determination and quantification of model coefficients it was observed that applied g value in bf operation is major parameter influencing the drag model coefficients followed by density of applied ballasts the model was evaluated by graphical comparison with experimental observations and found a significant correlation r2 0 83 the model also significantly correlated the experimental observations in linear regression analysis r2 0 84 a comparison of developed model predictions was performed with recently developed cd re correlations benchmarking the experimental observations of ballasted flocs and model developed in this study exhibited highest overlap r2 0 83 compared to other investigated models therefore due to successful prediction capability of experiment based cd observations compared to other recent cd re correlation developments the model can be adopted in the field of ballasted flocculation the prediction of vertical settling velocity of aggregates is primary important parameter in ballasted flocculation facility design and this proposed cd model can help in precise determination of ballasted floc settling velocity this can lead to efficient designing of a treatment facility design in the field of ballasted flocculation declaration of competing interest

13314,the ballasted flocs exhibit distinct transition characteristics due to their hybrid internal structure porous coagulated suspended particles and solid ballast proportions and compact aggregation the drag force exerted on a ballasted floc in fluid medium is distinct from conventional flocs due to less internal resistances partially impermeable structure and compact aggregation incorporating properties of ballasted floc shape porosity permeability ballasted proportion transition regime condition can lead to precise determination of drag coefficient cd in previous ballasted flocculation bf studies researchers adopted cd 24 re which is a generalized equation and is limited to spherical objects in laminar regime however because of the non spherical shape hybrid floc structure having porous and solid proportions and the non laminar transition of ballasted flocs the drag coefficient can be underestimated in this study a deterministic drag model is proposed for ballasted flocs which corresponds to the real time regime condition and the ballasted floc characteristics the equation incorporates the floc shape characteristics degree of sphericity and the floc composition characteristics porosity permeability ballast embedment ratio that influence the drag force applied during floc transition the evaluation of model predictions with real time ccd camera based floc size and settling velocity observations from previous studies revealed that the proposed model is most suitable approach r2 0 83 to determine drag coefficient of ballasted flocs this can lead to efficient designing of ballasted flocculation facilities graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords drag coefficient ballasted flocs floc shape floc composition reynolds number 1 introduction the relative motion between an object and its surrounding fluid leads to normal and shear stresses exerted on the object from surrounding fluid the surface integral of all these stresses is denoted as drag force fd 1 to ease the determination of drag force a dimensionless drag coefficient cd is introduced exhibiting drag force per unit projected area size of sphere having equivalent surface area to object under evaluation depends only on reynolds number re according to most of the previous studies 2 the downward movement of the object is dependent on the object properties size shape porosity permeability and fluid properties newtonian or non newtonian 3 settling of particles in fluid medium is objective of many processes and engineering applications therefore study of drag phenomenon applied on settling objects is crucial 4 the precise evaluation of drag coefficient cd is imperative for accurate determination of the terminal settling velocity of vertically falling particles 5 the absence of any general solution lead to many empirical and semi empirical correlations quantifying the relationship between cd and re reynolds number associated with different veracities and validation ranges for spherical regular e g cylinder ellipsoid cube and irregular shapes 6 due to the complexity of shape characterization many studies dealing with particulate flows used spheres and regular shapes for experimental studies or assumed irregularly shaped particles as perfect spheres for model development 7 in the past few decades however many shape descriptors were introduced in particulate flow studies such as roundness sphericity irregularity ratio of longest to shortest dimension and the ratio of particle surface area to the equivalent sphere area to evaluate the irregularly shaped particles 8 the most widely adopted cd models in coagulation studies are based on studies of regular shaped particles 2 arbitrarily shaped flocs during transition in water experience momentum on all coordinate axis 9 in coagulation studies the force exerted opposite to particle motion fd drag force is considered as most important to comprehend because it hinders solid liquid separation which is the core objective of the bf ballasted flocculation process 10 the fd is quantified in model development by a dimensionless number cd exhibiting resistances of flocs during transition in water 11 many researchers modelled cd as a function of re by empirical relationships based on experimental data of regular shaped particles due to absence of any deterministic model 2 thus the developed models do not incorporate accurate characterization of particle size shape composition and are limited to a certain re range so it is important to develop a general cd model that not only quantifies size shape and composition of arbitrarily shaped ballasted flocs in unified manner but also applicable to wide range of re the flocs aggregated in conventional coagulation process are porous and fragile due to loose aggregation of suspended solids 41 the water passage from internal floc structure lead to high internal resistances translated to higher drag force during transition of conventional flocs however ballasted flocculation is advanced coagulation phenomenon in which high specific gravity ballast media is injected during coagulation which is embedded in internal floc structure during aggregation to form ballasted flocs 12 the ballast collisions with coagulated suspended particles under applied agitation lead to compact floc formation 13 therefore ballasted flocs exhibit hybrid characteristics due to porous and solid proportions which reflect the aggregation of ballast particles with chemical floc matrix high density and inertia compact formation and distinct settling pattern compared to flocs aggregated in conventional coagulation process 14 the high density of aggregated ballasted flocs is translated into dominance of inertial force over viscous forces during transition and exhibits higher reynold number re value compared to conventional flocs so the ballasted flocs usually follow the transitional flow regime 1 re 103 compared to conventional flocs which follow laminar transition re 1 15 the embedment of ballast in internal structure of ballasted flocs hinders water passage leading to less internal resistances translated to less drag force exerted during transition in water medium due to differences in composition transition condition and infinite number of irregular shapes the previously developed models were unable to predict the cd for ballasted flocs therefore it is essential to develop a cd model incorporating the ballasted floc properties in the present study a deterministic approach was used to develop a general cd model for ballasted flocs by incorporating parameters for quantification of influencing factors shape porosity permeability and ballast proportion the proposed model was evaluated corresponding to experiment based cd observations concurrent real time size and velocity observations of ballasted flocs using ccd camera translated to experimental cd observations using stokes law from several studies table 1 and recently reported cd re correlations the model exhibited higher r2 value 0 83 during simulation with experiment based cd observations compared to recently reported cd re correlations under investigation therefore the developed model can be adopted as suitable approach for drag determination of ballasted flocs leading to efficient treatment facility design 2 a review of recently developed drag coefficient models it has been a challenge for scientists and researchers to develop a cd re correlation applicable to entire subcritical flow conditions re 200 000 equally applicable to all types of particle flow applications in the fields of fluid mechanics mechanical engineering chemical engineering and environmental engineering 11 many researchers developed the empirical cd re correlation by experimental data fitting using regression analysis to a presumed mathematical expression 16 most of the experimental cd re direct observations were performed using solid particles with regular shapes which leads to development of models applicable to regularly shaped particles 17 however most engineering applications work with irregular shaped particle flow and developed models underestimate the cd observations of irregular shaped objects some researchers proposed indirect empirical cd re correlations by presuming mathematical expressions including an overview of shape descriptors for irregularly shaped particles for precise cd predictions of regular and irregular shaped particles 18 over the last decade many researchers proposed empirical cd re relationships to predict the standard drag curve for regular and irregularly shaped particles in this study five recently developed cd re models exhibited in table 2 along with range of applicability were evaluated in comparison to the predications of cd model proposed in this study benchmarking the experiment based cd re observations the morrison 2013 model was developed using piecewise matched procedure to cover the transition from laminar to turbulent region 19 terfous et al developed cd re relationship using the simple series function and the least squares method 20 however this model is limited to re of 0 1 replacing traditional term 24 re with 21 683 re the barati et al as based on a multi gene genetic programming gp procedure to precise cd re correlation prediction from low to complete subcritical flow conditions re up to 106 21 gp have an advantage over other empirical model development methods to determine the structure and parameters of model simultaneously compared to other methods where structure of model is user defined and parameters are assigned by regression analysis bagheri and bonadonna 22 developed a cd re relationship based on the particle reynolds number alongwith two shape descriptors defined as a function of particle flatness elongation and diameter 22 the new shape descriptors introduced in this model were easy to measure and characterize in this model the effect of orientation of transiting particles on cd was evaluated in addition to predict the end members of cd due to change in the particle orientation model established by hongli et al 39 was based on a series of cd re relationships of spherical particles based on stokes law the oseen law and the goldstein law and 480 experimental data groups 23 the presumed rational function exhibited in table 2 was found effective containing re as only dependent variable to explicate the cd re correlation for a wide re range this new developed model exhibited higher degree of correlation with experimental datasets over wide re range the above mentioned models were developed based on regression analysis between experimental observations and presumed or computed cd re correlations building on the previous developed models from simple mathematical expressions to complex functions with re being the prime parameter for cd determination in the field of ballasted flocculation the experimental observations revealed that cd is dependent on many functions shape orientation transition regime condition ballast function porosity permeability and ballasted flocculation operational conditions depending on characteristics of aggregated flocs 9 therefore the empirical cd re correlations developed in previous studies found suitable in conventional floc studies were unable to explicate the impact of all abovementioned characteristics at determined cd values for ballasted flocs 24 25 fig 1 differentiates the transition mechanism of conventional and ballasted flocs in conventional flocs the normal stresses ns shear stresses ss and internal resistances ir are higher compared to ballasted flocs due to fragile and porous nature of conventional flocs leading to higher exerted drag force fd ns ss ir during floc transition 9 drag coefficient drag forces fd exerted per unit projection area ap is therefore higher compared to ballasted flocs on the other hand ballasted flocs exhibit less internal resistances ir due to hindrance of water passage from internal floc structure because of nonporous ballast embedment moreover compact aggregation of ballasted flocs due to ballast collisions with suspended solids leads to less exerted normal and shear stresses which is translated to less applied drag force per unit projection area during ballasted floc transition in water medium 26 in addition ballasted flocs exhibit higher reynolds number re ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces due to dominance of inertial forces due to embedment of high specific gravity ballasts with suspended solids compared to low density conventional flocs it is important to accommodate abovementioned properties of distinct natured ballasted flocs to determine the drag coefficient therefore it is imperative to develop a cd model based on characteristic of ballasted flocs to predict the cd re trend in the field of ballasted flocculation the model can be extended to precise determination of settling velocity of ballasted flocs leading to efficient bf facility design 27 3 development of drag coefficient model for ballasted flocs the objective of this study was to develop a precise correlation for drag coefficient determination of ballasted flocs with a wide range of applicability which can be a useful tool for designing of ballasted flocculation bf facility therefore a deterministic approach was used for model development in this study in various studies drag coefficient cd was reported as influenced by certain properties of flocs such as flow condition and orientation of floc in the flow stream shape porosity permeability and ballast content in the case of ballasted flocs 12 18 25 based on observations of previous studies following parameters were identified to be incorporated in development of deterministic cd model 1 c d f re θ η ω ε where re reynolds number transition regime condition θ shape descriptor of flocs degree of sphericity of flocs ε function of ballasted floc structure ballast content in the floc aggregation η porosity of aggregated floc ω floc permeability it was important to identify the relationships of all abovementioned parameters with cd for ballasted flocs the determination of these correlations can lead to development of a comprehensive cd model 3 1 reynolds number re is a dimensionless number indicating the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces of a ballasted floc in fluid medium re of a vertically settling floc in a water medium can be determined by deterministic eq 2 2 re ρ w d f v f μ where d f size of floc v f settling velocity of floc ρ w density of water μ absolute viscosity of water many researchers plotted experimental size and velocity based re observations against cd and exibited the correlation of inverse proportionality between cd and re as shown in eq 3 2 9 3 c d a re b where a balancing coefficient can be calibrated by experimental observations b slope of the cd re curve can be determined by experimental observations in the case of ballasted flocs eq 3 can be transformed to eq 4 by introducing a coefficient based on eq 1 exhibiting other factors shape floc structure porosity and permeability influencing the drag coefficient of ballasted flocs it was imperative to study the effect of each influencing parameter individually on the drag coefficient of ballasted flocs for the development of comprehensive cd model 4 c d a re b f θ ε η ω 3 2 floc shape the ballasted flocs being arbitrarily shaped particles the drag force is exerted on all three axes during their vertical downward movement in a water medium the spherical shaped particles experience less drag force compared to similar sized irregularly shaped particles 14 18 the previous researchers used spherical particles or an assumption of particle sphericity for the development of drag coefficient models however the developed models underestimated the drag coefficient for ballasted flocs which are composed of infinite number of arbitrary shapes in the last decade many shape descriptors were introduced to study the arbitrary shaped particles in unified manner 14 28 30 the shape descriptor quantifying particle s degree of sphericity eq 5 was adopted in this study 31 to model infinite no of irregular shapes of ballasted flocs in unified manner 5 θ 4 π a f p f 2 where a f area of ballasted floc p f perimeter of ballasted floc the value of this shape descriptor equals 1 for completely spherical particles the previous studies reported relationship of inverse proportionality between sphericity and drag coefficient of aggregated flocs this relationship was adopted for ballasted flocs to incorporate the shape effect in drag coefficient model 6 c d 1 θ 3 3 floc structure the ballasted flocs exhibit hybrid characteristics due to dual structure composed of solid and porous proportions of ballasts and coagulated colloidal substances respectively 12 the ballasted flocs experience less drag force due to less internal resistances resulted by inability of water passage from impermeable solid proportion and compact coagulated suspended substances of floc as exhibited in fig 1 therefore the ballast content in floc aggregation has inverse proportionality with drag coefficient eq 7 it is important to determine the ballasted content in the structure of aggregated floc for drag coefficient modeling lapointe and barbeau 2016 introduced a model eq 8 to determine density of ballasted floc based on ballasted and non ballasted proportions of floc 14 by reorganizing that model eq 8 to eq 9 it can be adopted to determine the ballast fraction in aggregated floc 12 the introduction of ballast content in the cd model can lead to precise determination of drag coefficient of a ballasted floc 7 c d 1 ε 8 ρ f ρ b ε ρ cfm 1 ε 9 ε ρ f ρ cfm ρ b ρ cfm where ρ f density of floc ρ cfm density of coagulated colloidal substances ρ b density of employed ballast ε ballast fraction in the aggregated floc 3 4 floc porosity the internal floc structure controls the extent of advective flow and hence the corresponding hydrodynamic drag force exerted on the floc during settling according to the previous studies the extent of advective flow through the flocs depends upon the particle s packing pattern and available pore spaces among aggregated particles to constitute a floc 32 the fraction of floc volume composed of pores is called floc porosity the floc porosity is measured through the mass balance function as ratio of effective floc density density difference between floc and water to the effective density of suspended particles density difference between suspended particles and water which constitute a floc as explicated in eq 10 32 10 1 η ρ f ρ w ρ s ρ w where ρ f density of floc ρ w density of water ρ s density of colloidal particles in suspension η porosity of aggregated floc fraction of voids 1 η fraction of coagulated particles and ballasts in the aggregated floc as pore fraction increases in the floc it experiences higher drag force due to higher internal resistance caused by fluid passage from within the floc structure therefore η is directly proportional to drag coefficient as exhibited in eq 11 11 c d η 3 5 floc permeability in addition to floc porosity floc permeability is another important factor that controls the extent of advective flow from within the floc 33 floc permeability is defined as pore interconnectedness in the floc and measured as amount of water flow from the floc interior distance time and referred as hydraulic conductivity of floc 34 in ballasted flocs the ballast fraction of floc is considered as impermeable proportion while the fraction of aggregation of suspended solids is considered as permeable proportion the permeable proportion allows water passage from within the floc structure the enhanced internal resistances due to higher permeable fraction in floc structure exhibited direct proportionality with drag coefficient as exhibited in eq 12 therefore permeable fraction of floc was incorporated in this model which was computed by eq 13 35 12 c d ω 13 ω 1 ε where ω represents the permeable fraction in floc and is measured by the difference of ballast fraction in floc ε from the total floc volume 3 6 proposed drag coefficient model the following drag coefficient equation eq 14 was proposed for ballasted flocs in this study incorporating the function for floc transition in a fluid medium eq 3 floc shape eq 6 ballast effect eq 7 ballast content in floc structure eq 11 and permeable fraction of internal floc structure eq 12 in eq 4 14 c d aηω re b θε eq 14 can be simplified by substituting eqs 5 9 10 and 13 to develop a comprehensive and effective drag coefficient model

corresponding to experimental re values exhibiting an adjusted r2 value of 0 81 as explicated in fig 2 the determined values of a b coefficients were substituted in eq 15 to develop a cd model eq 16

during mixing classifications w r t applied ballast type and mixing conditions corresponding to adopted studies are exhibited in table 1 to quantify the impact of applied ballast characteristics and applied velocity gradient on drag coefficient of aggregated flocs the normal distribution curve of experiment based cd observations corresponding to ballast type classification fig 3 a exhibited that drag coefficient of ballasted flocs is inversely proportional to density of applied ballasts 9 the high density ballasts transform to high density compact flocs due to suspended solids collisions with high density ballasts leading to floc compaction this embedment of high density ballasts in floc structure leads to high inertial forces and compact aggregation of ballasted flocs leads to lower internal resistances during floc transition which is collectively translated into lower applied drag force at vertically settling flocs therefore density of applied ballast can be a decisive parameter to compute a b coefficients of eq 15 similarly the normal distribution curve of classified experiment based cd observations based on applied conditions in adopted studies for aggregation mentioned in table 1 corresponding to applied g value fig 3 b im refers to instant mix rm refers to rapid mix and sm refers to slow mix during aggregation in fig 3 b exhibited that with higher applied g value ballasted flocs with lower cd values can be aggregated the applied g value is decisive parameter of floc growth and floc compaction in ballasted flocculation as exhibited in fig s1 of supplementary information and further elaborated in section s1 of appendix a supplementary data and therefore its crucial impact is expected in quantification of a b coefficients of eq 15 12 the experiment based cd observations from adopted studies table 1 classified corresponding to ballast type and applied velocity gradient aggregation conditions used in studies elaborated in table 1 were passed through user defined non linear curve fitting corresponding to eq 15 following the above mentioned procedure and values of a b were recomputed for each classified dataset to the datasets applied normal distribution in fig 3 individually the results determined values for a b for each individual dataset are mentioned in fig 3 a and b revealed that the coefficient a is function of applied ballast density and applied g value with its value varying from 15 94 21 94 corresponding to varied density ballasts and varied applied g value therefore a function can be developed to predict value of a based on applied ballast condition and applied velocity gradient conditions however an insignificant variation was observed in the case of coefficient b exhibiting b as a factor exhibiting the slope of cd re curve as slope of cd re curve exhibited insignificant change for individual datasets based on applied ballast type and applied g value 5 evaluation and comparison of proposed model with recently developed drag models the predictions of proposed cd model plotted corresponding to model based re values floc size re correlation proposed by qasim et al 2020 and compared with experiment

r2 value of 0 83 moreover the major proportion of experiment based cd observations corresponding to model predictions exhibited that ballasted flocs exhibit a slight deviation from standard cd re curve as exhibited in fig 4 a this can be due to hybrid internal structure of ballasted flocs composed of solid ballasts and porous coagulated suspended solids leading to a distinct transition phenomenon during vertical settling the ballasted flocs exhibit higher re values compared to conventional flocs due to dominance of inertial forces over viscous forces as a result of ballast embedment in floc aggregation moreover the compact formation of aggregates and ballast particles in internal floc structure block the internal pores of aggregated flocs fig 1 leading to hindrance of water passage from internal floc structure during its downward transition in water column this hinderance of water passage is translated to lower internal resistances compared to conventional flocs reducing overall drag force applied at ballasted flocs therefore ballasted flocs exhibit a distinct transition phenomenon and superficial settling compared to conventionally aggregated flocs therefore the application of previously developed cd re correlations can underestimate the cd predictions for ballasted flocs to further investigate the significance of proposed cd model eq 16 compared to experiment based cd observations a linear regression analysis was performed between experiment based cd observations and cd model predictions the r2 value in linear regression exhibits the degree of correlation of experimental observations to the model predictions the resulted graph fig 5 a exhibited a significant correlation 0 84 between experiment and model based cd values moreover the model based cd re predictions in this study were compared with recently developed cd re correlations table 2 benchmarking the experiment based cd re observations as exhibited in fig 5 b the results revealed that model proposed in this study exhibited a significant overlap r2 0 83 to the trend of experiment based cd re observations the model developed by barati et al exhibited a partial agreement with r2 0 58 following the model proposed in this study 21 the other models in comparison exhibited a partial agreement with trendline following the barati et al 2014 slightly overestimating the experiment based cd observations at major proportion of experimental scatter corresponding to re value of 10 100 19 20 22 the model developed by hongli et al 2015 exhibited a higher overestimation compared to other models under investigation 23 the reason can be the hybrid nature of ballasted flocs leads to distinct drag and transition phenomenon therefore it was concluded that model proposed in this study is capable to precisely predict the cd values for ballasted flocs compared to recently developed cd re correlations therefore the proposed model eq 15 can be adopted for cd prediction of ballasted flocs and can be very useful in designing the ballasted flocculation treatment facilities 6 conclusion in most of the previous studies the drag coefficient was empirically modelled with only one function re using experimental observations of regular shaped objects however drag coefficient is dependent on drag force which is a complex phenomenon and is dependent on characteristics of transiting object shape porosity permeability transition regime condition and characteristic of surrounding fluid newtonian or non newtonian the application of previously developed empirical cd re correlations in the field of ballasted flocculation can lead to underestimation or overestimation of drag coefficient due to hybrid nature porous and solid proportions in internal structure and distinct transition characteristics due to hybrid internal structure of ballasted flocs therefore it was imperative to develop a deterministic natured cd re model for ballasted flocs for precise drag determination of ballasted flocs in this study a deterministic cd re model was proposed based on characteristics of ballasted flocs shape porosity permeability transition condition and rate of ballast embedment the developed model was simulated with real time ballasted floc observations from previous studies for determination and quantification of model coefficients it was observed that applied g value in bf operation is major parameter influencing the drag model coefficients followed by density of applied ballasts the model was evaluated by graphical comparison with experimental observations and found a significant correlation r2 0 83 the model also significantly correlated the experimental observations in linear regression analysis r2 0 84 a comparison of developed model predictions was performed with recently developed cd re correlations benchmarking the experimental observations of ballasted flocs and model developed in this study exhibited highest overlap r2 0 83 compared to other investigated models therefore due to successful prediction capability of experiment based cd observations compared to other recent cd re correlation developments the model can be adopted in the field of ballasted flocculation the prediction of vertical settling velocity of aggregates is primary important parameter in ballasted flocculation facility design and this proposed cd model can help in precise determination of ballasted floc settling velocity this can lead to efficient designing of a treatment facility design in the field of ballasted flocculation declaration of competing interest
