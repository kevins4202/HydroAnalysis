22975,a proper estimation of the ship accelerations particularly in the transversal direction is fundamental for predicting the risk of cargo shifts and inherent structural damages in severe irregular seas a specific situation worth to be considered in this context is the so called dead ship condition in which the ship because of a loss of steering capabilities is drifting in beam waves at zero speed particularly in this situation a proper modelling of ship dynamics in wave is deemed necessary for a reliable assessment of inertial loads in this paper three time domain procedures with different accuracy are applied and compared the aim is to investigate the dependency of inertial loads on the non linear effects of ship geometry and on the couplings among the 6dof of the ship simulations are carried out with in input the same irregular sea realizations in the time domain obtained from a digitalisation of jonswap spectra a technique allowing for a fine matching of the digitalised spectra to the analytical ones is developed and applied the investigation indicates that couplings among ship motions trigger larger inertial loads and accordingly a larger probability of occurrence for cargo shifting and structural damages 1 introduction ships operating in severe sea states are exposed to large accelerations and consequently to strong inertial loads which can bring to cargo shifting and in turn to damages to structures or to stability issues zhang and li 2017 serious cases of loss of stability caused by cargo shift and or by waves and wind are quite common for bulk carriers and ro ro vessels ro ro vessels are further vulnerable to fires possibly generated by shifting and tilting of cars and trucks in the hold nowadays countermeasures against excessive lateral accelerations are sought through the definition of guidelines aimed at avoiding dangerous combinations of ship speed and course in given seaways acanfora et al 2017a jia 2007 the so called dead ship condition is identified by imo rules as the worst scenario for assessing ship safety and stability in the event of severe wind and wave combination this condition implies a complete black out of the ship main propulsion plant and auxiliaries leading to a zero forward speed a loss in steering capabilities and a sea encountered at beam in these conditions roll motions are dominant and severe transversal inertial loads arise without any possibility of adopting effective operational countermeasures this makes the scenario crucial from e g the design of the rigging system the problem of a dead ship rolling is often studied in conjunction with wind effects all vessels longer than 24m must fulfil the imo weather criterion imo 2008 accounting for wind and wave combined effects in a quasi static fashion this criterion is often criticized because of its simplified and empirical background spyrou et al 2011 vassalos et al 2003 and the need is often highlighted for including all the pertinent non linearities and degrees of freedom in the analysis of the ship dynamic responses an overview of models for the prediction of the ship dynamics in irregular seas is given in neves 2016 where the challenges in simulating nonlinear roll responses and in implementing properly roll damping are highlighted scenarios for direct assessments of the safety of dead ships are often conventionally modelled by a jonswap spectrum having a significant wave height hs 11m and mean zero crossing period tz in the range of the natural roll period of the ship spyrou et al 2011 vassalos et al 2003 resonance conditions are expected to lead to the worst and largest roll amplitudes and thus to the highest inertial loads the problem however of identifying the ship natural roll frequency at large amplitudes arises wawrzynski and krata 2016 when considering large roll responses it is also worth mentioning that a ship in beam waves at zero speed could as well experience parametric roll as observed experimentally in ikeda et al 2006 in matusiak 2000 the problem of a shift in the cargo onboard a ship sailing in irregular beam waves is studied also in that case a need is pointed out for the use of non linear models for the ship dynamics in order to obtain a fair accuracy in the prediction of the roll accelerations a method for the estimation of inertial loads on a containership in the event of synchronous and parametric roll motions is presented in acanfora et al 2017a acanfora et al 2017b in acanfora and matusiak 2016 the same method is applied to a ship in manoeuvring conditions in this context a proper estimation of the ship dynamics in wave combining seakeeping and manoeuvring models is deemed necessary for a reliable assessment of inertial loads the reason for adopting manoeuvring models is related to the need for including the so called cross flow drag force to model a drifting vessel míguez gonzález and bulian 2018 such force models the effect on the hull of the transversal flow component possibly including separation effects occurring around the ship transversal sections and acts in the horizontal and transversal direction for the ship this kind of force is typically included in ship manoeuvring models since it is always present on a manoeuvring ship however a robust model for a ship manoeuvring in irregular waves is still missing the shopera project provided seakeeping manoeuvring model tests in a combined seaway wind environment promoting a benchmark study among the available numerical prediction methods and tools el moctar et al 2016 three main approaches are available in the technical literature for modelling a ship manoeuvring in a seaway skejic 2013 convolution integral techniques fossen 2005 the two time scale technique skejic and faltinsen 2008 seo and kim 2011 and the cfd method based on the urans unsteady reynolds average navier stokes model perić and bertram 2011 kring et al 2011 liu and wan 2015 a majority of papers refers to regular wave simulations in lyu and el moctar 2017 a second order wave modelling is used to estimate drift resistance in regular beam waves in some cases models dealing with the ship behaviour in beam waves introduce soft springs to restore the yaw motion occurring in beam waves bulian and francescutto 2013 sadat hosseini et al 2016 only a few cases of simulations of ships manoeuvring in irregular seas are available in literature prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 kring et al 2011 skejic and faltinsen 2013 matusiak 2013 in míguez gonzález and bulian 2018 the authors report the behaviour in regular beam waves of a fishing vessel showing how an increasing level of complexity in the model of the ship dynamics influences positively the accuracy of the estimated roll motions complex numerical models are usually on the other hand more time consuming and less robust from a review of the state of the art it is noted that the motion responses have been investigated to a larger extent for ships with forward speed at all headings than for zero speed vessels it is also observed that a ship rolling in beam waves at zero speed is often modelled by a limited number of degrees of freedom thus neglecting f i the coupling of sway and yaw dynamics in conjunction with ship drifting moreover a limited attention has been given to non linearities leading to the modification of natural roll period at large amplitudes in irregular waves the present research work focuses on the estimation of the inertial loads on a dead ship in irregular beam waves different modelling approaches are implemented and applied with the aim of identifying the sensitivity and the dependency of the problem on the non linearities of the ship dynamics in particular on the effects of a non linear ship geometry and of the coupling among the 6dof of the ship in order to prevent additional uncertainties related to wind force modelling wind is neglected in the current research in the following section a model of irregular sea is developed and described focusing on the discretization of the sea spectrum the developed technique allows for quite a fine matching of the order zero moment of the spectrum the three numerical models used for the ship dynamics in irregular beam waves are later briefly introduced in section 3 the main assumptions and differences are underlined in section 4 applications will focus on estimating inertial loads for a ro ro passenger ship the three methods are applied for several combination of hs and tz the results obtained are shown and discussed in section 5 and section 6 respectively section 7 concludes 2 description of the sea when dealing with computational methods for the ship dynamics in waves often sea waves are conventionally modelled as plane progressive ones long crested sea the wave pattern encountered by a sailing ship is affected too by the waves generated by the vessel itself in the studied problem the dead ship assumption implies the absence of a steady wave pattern the numerical method implemented in the simulations models long crested irregular waves in the time domain starting from a power spectral density distribution for the sea for ship design purposes the significant wave height h s and the average zero crossing period t z are the most relevant quantities linked to the spectral representation of the sea through the following relationships valid for a stationary and ergodic process h s 4 m 0 t z 2 π m 0 m 2 however the time domain representation of a sea with a given spectrum might not exactly match these expected quantities it is important to recall that the shape of the power spectral density based on relatively short records of a stationary sea is very irregular and different each time a more stable characteristics should be the area of each spectrum representing the total energy per square metre the ensemble average of these spectra should yield a smoother spectrum that can be also interpreted as the spectrum obtained by processing a record with a very long time duration theoretical formulations like the jonswap spectrum here utilised were derived by this averaging process in the following subsection a technique used to model irregular long crested sea in time domain from a theoretical spectrum is presented and described a systematic application on a sample case will allow to evaluate the accuracy of the method in matching the input value of h s and t z as well as the area of the reference theoretical spectrum that as mentioned is obtained by the jonswap formulation 2 1 method developed for the numerical generation of irregular seas a fine numerical spectrum is implemented to match the theoretical values of significant wave height and zero cross period in the specific case this is obtained by assuming a frequency range from 0 02 rad s up to 29 rad s with a constant interval of 0 001 rad s this fine digital spectrum aims at replacing the theoretical continuous one in the applications in the following the two spectra will be identified another coarser numerical spectrum is derived by applying the techniques developed in matusiak 2013 where the sample angular frequencies are randomly chosen and unevenly spaced this is usually done to enforce the generation of non repeatable wave trains from a given wave spectrum the discrete spectrum is defined in a frequency range suitable to represent actual wave lengths the surface waves of interest fall in a range of length between a few meters up to one kilometre shorter waves with amplitudes close to zero can be neglected accordingly the discrete spectrum is defined only for frequencies below 1 5 rad s in fig 1 a comparison between fine and coarse spectra is given it is evident how the area below the coarse spectrum especially when the frequency resolution drops may differ significantly from the area below the fine one the amplitude of a single wave component corresponding to the angular frequency ω i is evaluated by applying the formula 1 a i 2 s ω i δ ω i usually the area of the discrete spectrum in the interval δ ω i is obtained by rectangular or trapezoidal approximation using the spectral values at the ends of the interval in the developed technique in order to preserve the energy content of the theoretical spectrum the quantity s ω i δ ω i is replaced by the area below the fine spectrum in the interval δ ω i in other words despite the adoption of the same discrete values in frequency adopted for the coarse spectrum the single values are chosen in order to maintain the total spectral energy in each interval instead of the spectral values at the ends of the interval conventional procedure the irregular wave train obtained at a fixed point is then obtained in all cases by linear superposition of the single wave components as 2 ζ o t i 1 n a i cos ω i t δ i where δi is the random phase angle of the ith wave component as known several wave trains different from each other can be generated from the same spectrum with the same number of wave components n by just changing the random phases δi and the frequency interval δ ω i unevenly defined at each generation 2 2 analysis of irregular seas generated by n 30 and n 60 wave components a sample application for n 30 frequency components is carried out on a jonswap spectrum defined by h s 7 5m and t z 9 5s see fig 1 the output of the developed technique as explained above is compared with the results of the discrete spectrum defined according to the conventional method as many as 200 wave trains each with a duration of 3 h are simulated with both techniques the corresponding h s and t z are calculated from each of the irregular wave time histories and arranged in normalized histograms respectively in figs 2 and 3 the comparison of the mean values and variances for the two hs histograms see fig 2 indicates that the newly developed technique is characterized by a lower variance in the output data this ensures that the significant wave height as derived by time domain simulations is relatively stable even though not exactly coincident with the value used as input datum for the spectrum adopted for the time signal generation the new technique shows however a mean value for hs somewhat smaller than the nominal one a reduction in terms of variance is obtained also in the zero cross period values see fig 3 even though the improvement is smaller the area of the spectrum can be overestimated or underestimated by the conventional technique depending on the discretization this results in a larger variance for hs and provides in the present case somewhat larger mean values see figs 1 and 2 the same analysis is then repeated by assuming n 60 in figs 4 and 5 the results for hs and tz are respectively reported it is worth observing that the outcomes in terms of mean value and variance for the new technique remains almost unchanged compared to the results by n 30 on the other hand the variances of hs and tz obtained by the conventional technique with n 60 are somehow similar to those obtained by the new developed technique with n 30 in other word the developed technique allows for generating irregular seas in time domain with same accuracy but by using a smaller number of wave components this is beneficial in saving computational time it is however noted that in all the cases the zero crossing periods calculated on the time domain realization of the irregular sea are on the average more than 0 5 s higher than the theoretical value this is explained because the higher frequency components smaller periods of the theoretical spectrum were neglected the effect could be corrected by providing a proper tail cut off as suggested in spectral properties of w 1989 3 the numerical models for ship dynamics in beam waves the dynamics of a ship in irregular beam waves is obtained by applying three different modelling approaches in the time domain non linear 6dof non linear 3dof and linear 6dof the irregular sea surface is modelled by n 30 wave components for which the amplitude the frequency and the phase are known see eq 2 the hull surface is discretized by means of triangular panels in eq 3 the irregular wave is calculated in the control points of the hull surface x c and y c referring to the center of each panel given in the earth fixed co ordinate system by means of a transformation matrix the coordinates x c and y c take into account the ship s position in waves 3 ζ t i 1 n a i cos k i x c c o s β y c s i n β ω i t δ i the non linear 6dof model is based on the equations of motions for a rigid ship see eq 4 the numerical model can be defined as hybrid or blended i e non linearities are accounted for restoring and froude krylov actions while radiation and diffraction actions are obtained by linear strip theory potential method and it is based on the assumptions explained in matusiak 2013 4 m a 11 u m q w r v a

terms a ij and k ij are respectively the added mass coefficients corresponding to the infinite frequency and elements of the memory function cummins 1962 modelling radiation actions in irregular sea the terms with the subscript wave include froude krylov diffraction and restoring forces and moments while the terms with the subscript man refer to manoeuvring actions i e further forces acting in the transversal direction and not included in the hull wave interaction the inertia froude krylov and restoring forces and moments are evaluated accounting for all the pertinent non linearities the pressure profile is assumed by applying the so called stretched distribution above the waterline this approach is a kind of extension of the linear wave theory to incorporate the nonlinear effects associated with the variation of the free surface the 3dof and 6dof non linear numerical models for irregular beam waves have been developed from a previous non linear version intended for regular beam waves acanfora and cirillo 2017 cross flow drag was modelled in agreement with cercos pita et al 2016 dealing with regular wave modelling it was possible to account for the viscous roll damping by means of available experimental test coefficients the implemented model demonstrated to properly match roll raos for different types of hull intact condition for which experimental data are available in literature cercos pita et al 2016 acanfora and de luca 2016 in modelling irregular sea damping viscous components are disregarded damping added mass and diffraction forces and moments are calculated beforehand by means of a potential strip theory code faltinsen 1990 and then implemented in the numerical model for irregular waves it is considered quite unnatural to derive non linear damping coefficients quadratic and cubic ittc 2011 from roll decay experiments and insert these into numerical simulations in which large motions and couplings are attained neves 2016 even though the choice of assuming only linear potential damping might be questionable while modelling large ship motions in irregular sea this approach still seems to provide quite satisfactory outcomes ittc 2002 ittc 2005 spanos and palmquist 2009 a limitation in the non linear simulation model for irregular sea is found when local wave amplitudes exceed the freeboard deck height this was already noted for code versions dealing with regular sea simulation results became less accurate for wave amplitudes higher than the freeboard acanfora and cirillo 2017 another limitation in the implemented non linear simulation model is found for large wave steepness especially at small wave periods however very short and high waves are quite rare as observable from the iacs scatter diagram iacs 2001 a proper modelling of the cross flow drag is necessary to account for the forces due to the transversal water velocity in beam waves when using the non linear 6 dof model the superposition of such transversal forces and the other potential seakeeping forces is treated in accordance with acanfora and matusiak 2016 the cross flow drag coefficient cd and the position of the centre of the inherent forces are the main input data for this part of the model the values selected can have a significant influence on the induced heeling moment in the absence of more precise data reference is made to the values suggested in bertram 2000 in the next section however results of a sensitivity analysis on cd values are presented the non linear 3dof model derives from the non linear 6dof one by modelling only heave pitch and roll motions based on this assumption the ship does not move in the horizontal plane and thus no transversal forces are implemented the non linearities of the immersed hull geometry on restoring and froude krylov forces and moments are accounted for radiation and inertial actions are modified in comparison to the 6dof model being disregarded the couplings between sway roll yaw the linear seakeeping 6dof model for irregular sea is realised by the superposition of each regular wave response in time domain calculated beforehand in the frequency domain faltinsen 1990 it is worth recalling that a linear seakeeping model disregards all non linearities on hull geometry and any cross couplings between velocity components the latter implies that the ship can only oscillate around a fixed point in all directions no transversal hull forces in the horizontal plane are needed in the following the three introduced methods implemented in matlab simulink will be applied to the same irregular sea realization to compare and discuss the respective outputs 4 simulations by different models the simulations are carried out on the ro ro pax ship named seatech d whose main characteristics are given in table 1 the hull is discretized by 20500 triangular panels the simulations are all carried out on a sample case characterized by a sea with n 30 nominal hs 7 5m and tz 9 5m for the ship at zero speed in beam waves as anticipated in section 2 the zero crossing period of the irregular sea realizations in time domain tends to shift towards higher values the average values from statistics in the time domain are hs 7 19m tz 10 21s while the nominal input values were as above mentioned hs 7 5m tz 9 5s this scenario does not correspond exactly to a synchronous roll resonance however it can be considered as not too far from it it has been chosen to provide quite large responses without leading to capsize in fig 6 a comparison of the time histories of ship motions by the three different methods is shown as anticipated in section 2 the 3 dof model does not compute surge sway and yaw components while all the linear responses oscillate around a null mean value in the non linear 6dof model a cross flow resistance computed with a drag coefficient cd 0 75 is applied at 65 of the instantaneous draft above the keel line all the simulations last 2 h however for the sake of clarity only a sample time range between 2800s and 4200s is plotted in the figures surge is omitted it is worth reminding that the same irregular wave realization in the time domain has been used in input to the three different prediction methods the different modelling approaches however result in different ship dynamic behaviours and thus in different ship wave relative motions encountered waves in fig 6 the encountered wave ζ at the centre of gravity is shown see eq 3 in fig 7 the inertial accelerations of the ship a iy in the direction of the y axis of the body fixed reference frame obtained by using the time history outputs of velocities and angular velocities are compared among the different methods see eq 5 the subscript 6nl stands for 6dof non linear the subscript 3nl stands for 3dof non linear the subscript 6lin stands for 6dof linear they are calculated at the centre of gravity of the ship thus x s y s z s 0 5 a i y v u r w p r q z s r x s r 2 p 2 y s p z s q p x s f o r 6 n l w p p 2 y s p z s q p x s f o r 3 n l v r x s p z s f o r 6 l i n 6 a i g y a i y g s i n ϕ c o s θ by definition accelerations correspond to inertial loads per unit of mass so the comparison is carried out in terms of accelerations the largest loads are found by the non linear 6 dof method while the outcomes of non linear 3 dof and the linear 6dof methods are noticeably smaller this highlights the impact of accounting for all motion components and interactions when estimating inertial loads including also the gravitational contribution eq 6 however the results of linear and non linear 6 dof methods result to be quite similar see fig 8 the cross flow drag coefficient currently used in all 6dof nl simulations is cd 0 75 fig 9 shows a comparison between the time histories accounting for two additional values of cd cd 1 0 and cd 1 15 it is noted that the values cd 0 75 and cd 1 0 do not show significant differences noticeable differences between the sway yaw and roll arise instead for cd 1 15 compared to the outcomes of the other cd values the highest cross flow drag coefficient induces larger roll motions 5 inertial load estimation according to the iacs scatter diagram this section presents the inertial loads calculated by the time domain numerical modelling in different sea conditions the irregular sea input for the simulations have been derived by applying the technique described in section 2 a total number of 168 sea states was considered with hs ranging between 0 5 m and 13 5m and tz between 4 5s and 15 5s these ranges correspond to the 99 97 of the occurrences reported in the iacs scatter diagram iacs 2001 for each combination of hs and tz a single realization of the sea is derived from the theoretical jonswap spectrum and used as input to the three different numerical models the simulations in all cases with zero forward speed and beam sea last 2 h each the inertial loads per unit mass in the lateral direction a iyg are calculated by applying eq 6 from the obtained time history see for example fig 8 the corresponding distribution of the response peaks a piyg is achieved in the calculation both positive and negative peaks are considered with their absolute values a graphical example by means of normalized histograms is provided in fig 10 the distribution of positive and negative peaks is shown on the left hand side while the corresponding distribution of their absolute values is shown on the right hand side as expected positive and negative peaks are distributed symmetrically around zero with a significant number of occurrences close to zero a threshold for the acceleration peaks is set to s 0 5g where g is the gravitational acceleration the value 0 5g is usually identified as a critical lateral acceleration acanfora et al 2017a shigunov et al 2010 it would correspond statically to a ship heeled by 30 the sea states inducing inertial loads exceeding the threshold value or the capsize of the ship within the time length of the simulation are identified in terms of hs and tz and marked in table 2 in red while the remaining safe ones are marked in green colour this procedure is applied to the numerical results obtained by 6dof non linear 3dof non linear and 6dof linear simulations the linear model shows exceeding cases concentrated in a range of tz between 8 5 and 15 5 s with a pronounced peak at about 12 s where exceedance is obtained even for a comparatively moderate hs value 5 5 m this tz value is in the proximity of the synchronous roll resonance range the corresponding jonswap spectrum features a theoretical peak period tp of about 15 2s close to the linear rolling period of table 1 the non linear models instead show an almost flat border i e not dependent on tz between green and red area at about hs 7 5m for the 6dof non linear method and at 9 5m for the 3dof non linear method as mentioned for the sample case with hs 7 5 m tz 9 5s identified by a black mark in table 2 a number of 200 irregular seas have been simulated and used as input to the 6dof linear and 6dof non linear models for all 200 input wave trains the corresponding h s and t z have been already calculated from the irregular wave time histories and arranged in normalized histograms respectively in figs 2 and 3 referring only to the newly developed technique for sea generation see chapt 2 for each simulation output the inertial load peaks a piyg are studied here peak stands for maximum value in each zero crossing period out of 200 simulations in 57 the threshold s was exceeded at least once using the linear model while with the non linear model exceedance occurred in 196 out of 200 simulations these values are coherent with the position of the black dots in the coloured areas of table 2 the mean values and the variance of the response peaks in each simulation respectively ζap and σap have been computed for both linear and non linear simulation outcomes the mean values ζap of all 200 distributions are shown in fig 11 arranged in normalized histograms 6lin on the left hand side 6nl on the right hand side respectively the ranges of mean values are nearly the same for both the models being comprised between 1 2 m s2 2 8 m s2 the spreading of the hs and tz values actually realised in the sea generation see figs 2 and 3 could be the main responsible for the development of such a large range in particular larger tz i e shifted towards the roll resonance period could trigger larger accelerations with the 6dof linear simulation method a pronounced modal value of ζap close to 1 5 m s2 is identified in the histogram differently from the 6dof non linear outcomes this means that most of the 200 simulations obtained generating different wave trains with the same nominal values of tz and hs provide a mean value of inertial loads in the proximity of 1 5 m s2 while using the non linear model the average value of the response is more varied the same type of comment can be derived by fig 12 where the variance values σap of all 200 distributions arranged in normalized histograms are depicted 6lin on the left hand side 6nl on the right hand side respectively the linear method clearly shows values of σap smaller than the non linear method outcomes with less scattered load values what above can be summarised saying that stable characteristics of the input wave train induce stable characteristics of the load response computed with the linear model while the same is not found for the output of the nonlinear model in other words the latter model has a non stationary behaviour and shows to be more sensitive to the specific time histories of the wave train different from each other than to their statistical properties similar 6 numerical model comparisons with available experiment data in this section a brief validation of the presented numerical models is carried out experimental results regarding the free drifting hull rolling in irregular beam waves at zero speed are not available for the seatech d ship treated above on the other hand the seatech d hull was extensively investigated by experimental model test campaign at the ship laboratory of the aalto university in scenarios corresponding to irregular waves at non zero speeds among the experimental tests carried out on this hull the roll responses in stern quartering seas were analysed in matusiak and stigler 2012 the loading condition in the tests is the same adopted in the analysis reported in the previous sections see table 1 for the sake of a proper comparison with such data the seaetch d hull advancing in irregular beam waves is simulated by an augmented version of the 6dof nl accounting for forward speed effects in the manoeuvring module for a further validation with available experimental data in conditions corresponding to regular beam waves at zero speed an additional hull is simulated and compared such additional hull corresponds to a passenger ferry for which an experimental campaign was carried out at the towing tank of the university of naples heave roll and sway responses were measured and collected in regular beam waves acanfora and de luca 2016 numerical predictions on the passenger ferry are carried out with the three models analysed while for the seatech d hull only the 6dof nl is adopted 6 1 seatech d rolling in irregular stern quartering waves fn 0 222 in this sub section a validation with available experimental data in irregular sea is carried out focusing on the 6dof nl model ship advancing with a froude number of 0 222 for the seatech d hull the available experimental data can be found in matusiak and stigler 2012 stigler 2012 they refer to straight course measurements of roll motions in irregular waves with fn 0 222 and β 45 two sea states characterized by hs 4 8 m and t1 5 9 s and hs 6 0 m and t1 7 7 s respectively are herein simulated and compared with the corresponding experimental results the term t1 is the mean wave period for a jonswap spectrum it holds t1 1 073tz lloyd 1998 the hull model used for the tests in a campaign carried out at the aalto university features a scale of 1 39 for such a simulation scenario characterized by a non null ship velocity the cross flow drag method used for determining the terms with subscript man in the 6dof nl see eq 4 is not adequate to describe hull forces in the horizontal plane addressed as manoeuvring forces therefore it is replaced by a linear manoeuvring model based on hydrodynamic derivatives which are estimated from the semi empirical formulae obtained with the aid of regression analysis see acanfora and matusiak 2016 triantafyllou and hover 2003 the irregular wave realizations in the time domain are obtained from the theoretical jonswap spectrum by applying the technique developed and presented in section 2 despite irregular seas are generated from the same theoretical spectrum assumed in the experiments the simulated wave trains in the time domain can differ from the experimental ones and from each other the fig 13 on the left hand side shows the experimental black line and the simulated orange line roll time histories for the case hs 4 8 m and t1 5 9 s on the right hand side a comparison of the corresponding roll spectra is depicted time and frequency scales refer to model scale comparisons of the simulated data is limited to a time range between 95 s and 135 s where the effective roll motions were measured the remaining experimental time history regarding transient stages is disregarded for additional info please check stigler 2012 in fig 14 the experimental and the numerical results for case hs 6 0 m and t1 7 7 s are arranged in time domain comparisons on the left hand side and frequency domain comparison on the right hand side as previously done the time range is herein limited within 130 s and 170 s for the same aforementioned reasons despite the limited amount of data and the different input wave train in time domain the simulated roll motions fairly reproduce the overall behaviour of the experimental data for both cases this agreement is particularly appreciable in the comparison of roll spectra 6 2 passenger ferry rolling in regular beam waves fn 0 the available experimental data for the passenger ferry are found in acanfora and de luca 2016 the roll data in intact and damage conditions were used for validating a previous version of the 6dof nl code intended for regular waves only acanfora and cirillo 2017 in the current section the roll sway and heave experimental data for the intact hull condition are compared with the outcomes of the simulations by 6dof nl and 6dof lin as above adopted and a 4dof nl roll sway heave pitch the latter model is introduced in this context replacing the 3dof nl roll heave pitch adopted in previous sections this model features still a number of degrees of freedom reduced from 6dof but with the further possibility of comparing sway results the ship model used for the experimental tests features a scale of 1 22 the main particulars in ship scale are given in table 3 the cross drag coefficient is set to cd 1 the chosen hull features a constant deadrise angle and in still water it floats in correspondence to the chine this makes it particularly sensitive to changes in the immersed hull geometry and waterplane area in waves despite the experimental conditions do not involve large motions the 6dof nl the 6dof lin and the 4dof nl i e the augmented 3dof nl models are run for the same wave frequencies adopted in the experimental tests the roll response is presented in the non dimensional form η44 ϕa ka the roll amplitude ϕa corresponds to the half of the difference between maximum and minimum roll response within each cycle k is the wave number and a is the wave amplitude the wave steepness is set to 1 75 the same definition of motion amplitude is used for the heave and sway non dimensional responses η33 za a and η22 ya a respectively in fig 15 the comparison between the three methods for the roll response is shown the 6dof nl model results blue line square marks finely match the experimental data black dashed line round marks the 6dof lin approach green line triangle marks despite neglecting the non linearity of the immersed hull shows a better agreement with the experimental roll results than the 4dof nl orange line cross marks suppression of the cross couplings between roll and yaw in the 4dof nl seems to imply a significant worsening in results probably because such couplings are effective in determining the actual added mass and damping this causes a shift in the resonance frequency of the roll responses obtained by 4dof nl with respect to those by 6dof lin and 6dof nl even though the exact resonant peaks of the roll responses cannot be appreciated from fig 15 since they might fall between the numerically simulated frequencies in fig 16 the comparison between the three methods for the sway response is shown it can be observed that none of the simulation models is fully effective the worst one is still the 4dof nl the cross couplings between sway and yaw that are disregarded in the 4dof nl seem to imply a significant worsening in results also in this case the sway motions calculated by the 6dof nl model are smaller than the 6dof lin model this could be due to an increase in radiation damping caused by considering a total sway velocity including both the oscillating and the stationary drifting part in the 6dof nl see the left hand side of fig 17 the decomposition in mean and filtered signal respectively the 6dof lin model does not describe the stationary drifiting component and features only the oscillatory component around zero right hand side of fig 17 a proper treatment of this computational issue will be addressed in future works on the other hand accounting for the stationary drifting component of sway may be crucial in evaluating the inertial loads by eq 5 similar considerations may apply to yaw motions fig 18 shows the comparisons in terms of heave responses the results of the 6dof lin somewhat interpolate the experimental data with a monotonically decreasing behaviour and larger values than the other methods the 6dof nl finely matches the experimental results only in a few points the 4dof nl model shows similar results compared to the 6dof nl except for the points where larger gaps were found in the corresponding roll and sway responses see figs 15 and 16 in this context heave motions appear therefore to be more sensitive to the non linearities of the immersed hull than to the couplings between roll sway and yaw 7 discussion the presented results should be critically interpreted based on the assumptions and on the limitations of the numerical methods the present study aims at investigating the effect of non linearities in the prediction of motions for a ship exposed to beam seas at zero speed dead ship the non linearities accounted for are those related to the non linear shape of the hull to the cross coupling of different type of motions and to viscous effects related to the water velocities in the transversal direction the hybrid approach implemented is based on the assembly of sub models validated in previous studies additional calculations are carried out in this paper for checking the reliability of the adopted simulation models comparisons with available experimental data show a fair agreement with the 6dof nl model the suppression of degrees of freedom and the assumption of linearity in the 3dof nl and in the 6dof lin respectively seem to lead to less accurate results regarding the 6dof nl there is certainly room for a further development of a unified theory for the ship dynamics combining cross flow drag model and ship motions in irregular beam waves however the applied approach based on the combination of existing sub models seems to be fairly adequate for studying dangerous situations the ship may be subjected to provided that the conditions in the applicability of the code are fulfilled it is worth reminding that as discussed above previous studies indicate that simulation results become less accurate for wave amplitudes higher than the freeboard acanfora and cirillo 2017 in the current context this might affect the reliability of results for hs 9 0m the numerical simulations demonstrated that the complete model including all the non linear effects above mentioned provides larger inertial loads this finding has been substantiated by applying the model on a wide set of sea states see table 2 but in most cases with a single realisation for each sea state even though inadequate for providing a quantitative assessment of the probability of exceeding a given limit nevertheless this approach can be useful for a first screening of critical cases about inertial loads for a specific sea state with hs 7 5 m tz 9 5s more deeply investigated in this paper with 200 realisations it was found that the non linear model in addition to providing larger responses showed to be less stable from a statistical point of view than the linear estimation providing results more dispersed and apparently more related to the specific realisation of the input wave time history this fact may further complicate the analysis as it implies a larger number of simulations in order to capture the statistical characteristics of the response further notes regard the enhancement of the response due to the onset of resonances in the motions in particular roll while in a linear model the resonance frequency is independent from the amplitude the same does not apply to non linear models for which the enhancement of response may be triggered see wawrzyński and krata 2016 in certain sea state realizations by peculiar combinations of wave amplitude and frequency together with large yaw motions indeed a proper interpretation of the non linear roll enhancement in irregular sea is still missing 8 conclusions a comparative analysis among three models for the prediction of ship inertial loads in the time domain was carried out based on the same set of irregular sea realizations in input to the models the investigation regards a specific vessel in a dead ship condition zero forward speed no manoeuvring capabilities and beam sea this accidental situation is particularly prone to the onset of severe roll motions and strong inertial loads on the cargo on deck and retaining devices it is therefore a good candidate for assessing inertial loads and developing design criteria for the retention system a technique allowing for a fine matching of the zero order moment of the wave spectrum with a smaller number of discrete components in comparison to standard procedures was developed and applied the simulation outcomes suggest that non linear models provide larger loads due to superposition and cross couplings of ship motions a limited number of degrees of freedom could still model roll motions however it might misrepresent the risk of cargo shifting especially in areas far away from the ship centre of gravity by using linear modelling inertial loads can be considered as a stationary process dominated by synchronous roll resonance phenomena the outcomes of non linear models reveal on the contrary non stationary properties possibly due to the effect of non linearities on the roll phenomena the 6dof linear model shows to be robust but not necessarily the most realistic one in predicting critical scenarios indeed the 6dof non linear model still needs refinements in the implementation especially regarding the coupling of transversal forces and seakeeping and a detailed analysis of the effects in terms of non stationary response and non linear resonance 
22975,a proper estimation of the ship accelerations particularly in the transversal direction is fundamental for predicting the risk of cargo shifts and inherent structural damages in severe irregular seas a specific situation worth to be considered in this context is the so called dead ship condition in which the ship because of a loss of steering capabilities is drifting in beam waves at zero speed particularly in this situation a proper modelling of ship dynamics in wave is deemed necessary for a reliable assessment of inertial loads in this paper three time domain procedures with different accuracy are applied and compared the aim is to investigate the dependency of inertial loads on the non linear effects of ship geometry and on the couplings among the 6dof of the ship simulations are carried out with in input the same irregular sea realizations in the time domain obtained from a digitalisation of jonswap spectra a technique allowing for a fine matching of the digitalised spectra to the analytical ones is developed and applied the investigation indicates that couplings among ship motions trigger larger inertial loads and accordingly a larger probability of occurrence for cargo shifting and structural damages 1 introduction ships operating in severe sea states are exposed to large accelerations and consequently to strong inertial loads which can bring to cargo shifting and in turn to damages to structures or to stability issues zhang and li 2017 serious cases of loss of stability caused by cargo shift and or by waves and wind are quite common for bulk carriers and ro ro vessels ro ro vessels are further vulnerable to fires possibly generated by shifting and tilting of cars and trucks in the hold nowadays countermeasures against excessive lateral accelerations are sought through the definition of guidelines aimed at avoiding dangerous combinations of ship speed and course in given seaways acanfora et al 2017a jia 2007 the so called dead ship condition is identified by imo rules as the worst scenario for assessing ship safety and stability in the event of severe wind and wave combination this condition implies a complete black out of the ship main propulsion plant and auxiliaries leading to a zero forward speed a loss in steering capabilities and a sea encountered at beam in these conditions roll motions are dominant and severe transversal inertial loads arise without any possibility of adopting effective operational countermeasures this makes the scenario crucial from e g the design of the rigging system the problem of a dead ship rolling is often studied in conjunction with wind effects all vessels longer than 24m must fulfil the imo weather criterion imo 2008 accounting for wind and wave combined effects in a quasi static fashion this criterion is often criticized because of its simplified and empirical background spyrou et al 2011 vassalos et al 2003 and the need is often highlighted for including all the pertinent non linearities and degrees of freedom in the analysis of the ship dynamic responses an overview of models for the prediction of the ship dynamics in irregular seas is given in neves 2016 where the challenges in simulating nonlinear roll responses and in implementing properly roll damping are highlighted scenarios for direct assessments of the safety of dead ships are often conventionally modelled by a jonswap spectrum having a significant wave height hs 11m and mean zero crossing period tz in the range of the natural roll period of the ship spyrou et al 2011 vassalos et al 2003 resonance conditions are expected to lead to the worst and largest roll amplitudes and thus to the highest inertial loads the problem however of identifying the ship natural roll frequency at large amplitudes arises wawrzynski and krata 2016 when considering large roll responses it is also worth mentioning that a ship in beam waves at zero speed could as well experience parametric roll as observed experimentally in ikeda et al 2006 in matusiak 2000 the problem of a shift in the cargo onboard a ship sailing in irregular beam waves is studied also in that case a need is pointed out for the use of non linear models for the ship dynamics in order to obtain a fair accuracy in the prediction of the roll accelerations a method for the estimation of inertial loads on a containership in the event of synchronous and parametric roll motions is presented in acanfora et al 2017a acanfora et al 2017b in acanfora and matusiak 2016 the same method is applied to a ship in manoeuvring conditions in this context a proper estimation of the ship dynamics in wave combining seakeeping and manoeuvring models is deemed necessary for a reliable assessment of inertial loads the reason for adopting manoeuvring models is related to the need for including the so called cross flow drag force to model a drifting vessel míguez gonzález and bulian 2018 such force models the effect on the hull of the transversal flow component possibly including separation effects occurring around the ship transversal sections and acts in the horizontal and transversal direction for the ship this kind of force is typically included in ship manoeuvring models since it is always present on a manoeuvring ship however a robust model for a ship manoeuvring in irregular waves is still missing the shopera project provided seakeeping manoeuvring model tests in a combined seaway wind environment promoting a benchmark study among the available numerical prediction methods and tools el moctar et al 2016 three main approaches are available in the technical literature for modelling a ship manoeuvring in a seaway skejic 2013 convolution integral techniques fossen 2005 the two time scale technique skejic and faltinsen 2008 seo and kim 2011 and the cfd method based on the urans unsteady reynolds average navier stokes model perić and bertram 2011 kring et al 2011 liu and wan 2015 a majority of papers refers to regular wave simulations in lyu and el moctar 2017 a second order wave modelling is used to estimate drift resistance in regular beam waves in some cases models dealing with the ship behaviour in beam waves introduce soft springs to restore the yaw motion occurring in beam waves bulian and francescutto 2013 sadat hosseini et al 2016 only a few cases of simulations of ships manoeuvring in irregular seas are available in literature prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 kring et al 2011 skejic and faltinsen 2013 matusiak 2013 in míguez gonzález and bulian 2018 the authors report the behaviour in regular beam waves of a fishing vessel showing how an increasing level of complexity in the model of the ship dynamics influences positively the accuracy of the estimated roll motions complex numerical models are usually on the other hand more time consuming and less robust from a review of the state of the art it is noted that the motion responses have been investigated to a larger extent for ships with forward speed at all headings than for zero speed vessels it is also observed that a ship rolling in beam waves at zero speed is often modelled by a limited number of degrees of freedom thus neglecting f i the coupling of sway and yaw dynamics in conjunction with ship drifting moreover a limited attention has been given to non linearities leading to the modification of natural roll period at large amplitudes in irregular waves the present research work focuses on the estimation of the inertial loads on a dead ship in irregular beam waves different modelling approaches are implemented and applied with the aim of identifying the sensitivity and the dependency of the problem on the non linearities of the ship dynamics in particular on the effects of a non linear ship geometry and of the coupling among the 6dof of the ship in order to prevent additional uncertainties related to wind force modelling wind is neglected in the current research in the following section a model of irregular sea is developed and described focusing on the discretization of the sea spectrum the developed technique allows for quite a fine matching of the order zero moment of the spectrum the three numerical models used for the ship dynamics in irregular beam waves are later briefly introduced in section 3 the main assumptions and differences are underlined in section 4 applications will focus on estimating inertial loads for a ro ro passenger ship the three methods are applied for several combination of hs and tz the results obtained are shown and discussed in section 5 and section 6 respectively section 7 concludes 2 description of the sea when dealing with computational methods for the ship dynamics in waves often sea waves are conventionally modelled as plane progressive ones long crested sea the wave pattern encountered by a sailing ship is affected too by the waves generated by the vessel itself in the studied problem the dead ship assumption implies the absence of a steady wave pattern the numerical method implemented in the simulations models long crested irregular waves in the time domain starting from a power spectral density distribution for the sea for ship design purposes the significant wave height h s and the average zero crossing period t z are the most relevant quantities linked to the spectral representation of the sea through the following relationships valid for a stationary and ergodic process h s 4 m 0 t z 2 π m 0 m 2 however the time domain representation of a sea with a given spectrum might not exactly match these expected quantities it is important to recall that the shape of the power spectral density based on relatively short records of a stationary sea is very irregular and different each time a more stable characteristics should be the area of each spectrum representing the total energy per square metre the ensemble average of these spectra should yield a smoother spectrum that can be also interpreted as the spectrum obtained by processing a record with a very long time duration theoretical formulations like the jonswap spectrum here utilised were derived by this averaging process in the following subsection a technique used to model irregular long crested sea in time domain from a theoretical spectrum is presented and described a systematic application on a sample case will allow to evaluate the accuracy of the method in matching the input value of h s and t z as well as the area of the reference theoretical spectrum that as mentioned is obtained by the jonswap formulation 2 1 method developed for the numerical generation of irregular seas a fine numerical spectrum is implemented to match the theoretical values of significant wave height and zero cross period in the specific case this is obtained by assuming a frequency range from 0 02 rad s up to 29 rad s with a constant interval of 0 001 rad s this fine digital spectrum aims at replacing the theoretical continuous one in the applications in the following the two spectra will be identified another coarser numerical spectrum is derived by applying the techniques developed in matusiak 2013 where the sample angular frequencies are randomly chosen and unevenly spaced this is usually done to enforce the generation of non repeatable wave trains from a given wave spectrum the discrete spectrum is defined in a frequency range suitable to represent actual wave lengths the surface waves of interest fall in a range of length between a few meters up to one kilometre shorter waves with amplitudes close to zero can be neglected accordingly the discrete spectrum is defined only for frequencies below 1 5 rad s in fig 1 a comparison between fine and coarse spectra is given it is evident how the area below the coarse spectrum especially when the frequency resolution drops may differ significantly from the area below the fine one the amplitude of a single wave component corresponding to the angular frequency ω i is evaluated by applying the formula 1 a i 2 s ω i δ ω i usually the area of the discrete spectrum in the interval δ ω i is obtained by rectangular or trapezoidal approximation using the spectral values at the ends of the interval in the developed technique in order to preserve the energy content of the theoretical spectrum the quantity s ω i δ ω i is replaced by the area below the fine spectrum in the interval δ ω i in other words despite the adoption of the same discrete values in frequency adopted for the coarse spectrum the single values are chosen in order to maintain the total spectral energy in each interval instead of the spectral values at the ends of the interval conventional procedure the irregular wave train obtained at a fixed point is then obtained in all cases by linear superposition of the single wave components as 2 ζ o t i 1 n a i cos ω i t δ i where δi is the random phase angle of the ith wave component as known several wave trains different from each other can be generated from the same spectrum with the same number of wave components n by just changing the random phases δi and the frequency interval δ ω i unevenly defined at each generation 2 2 analysis of irregular seas generated by n 30 and n 60 wave components a sample application for n 30 frequency components is carried out on a jonswap spectrum defined by h s 7 5m and t z 9 5s see fig 1 the output of the developed technique as explained above is compared with the results of the discrete spectrum defined according to the conventional method as many as 200 wave trains each with a duration of 3 h are simulated with both techniques the corresponding h s and t z are calculated from each of the irregular wave time histories and arranged in normalized histograms respectively in figs 2 and 3 the comparison of the mean values and variances for the two hs histograms see fig 2 indicates that the newly developed technique is characterized by a lower variance in the output data this ensures that the significant wave height as derived by time domain simulations is relatively stable even though not exactly coincident with the value used as input datum for the spectrum adopted for the time signal generation the new technique shows however a mean value for hs somewhat smaller than the nominal one a reduction in terms of variance is obtained also in the zero cross period values see fig 3 even though the improvement is smaller the area of the spectrum can be overestimated or underestimated by the conventional technique depending on the discretization this results in a larger variance for hs and provides in the present case somewhat larger mean values see figs 1 and 2 the same analysis is then repeated by assuming n 60 in figs 4 and 5 the results for hs and tz are respectively reported it is worth observing that the outcomes in terms of mean value and variance for the new technique remains almost unchanged compared to the results by n 30 on the other hand the variances of hs and tz obtained by the conventional technique with n 60 are somehow similar to those obtained by the new developed technique with n 30 in other word the developed technique allows for generating irregular seas in time domain with same accuracy but by using a smaller number of wave components this is beneficial in saving computational time it is however noted that in all the cases the zero crossing periods calculated on the time domain realization of the irregular sea are on the average more than 0 5 s higher than the theoretical value this is explained because the higher frequency components smaller periods of the theoretical spectrum were neglected the effect could be corrected by providing a proper tail cut off as suggested in spectral properties of w 1989 3 the numerical models for ship dynamics in beam waves the dynamics of a ship in irregular beam waves is obtained by applying three different modelling approaches in the time domain non linear 6dof non linear 3dof and linear 6dof the irregular sea surface is modelled by n 30 wave components for which the amplitude the frequency and the phase are known see eq 2 the hull surface is discretized by means of triangular panels in eq 3 the irregular wave is calculated in the control points of the hull surface x c and y c referring to the center of each panel given in the earth fixed co ordinate system by means of a transformation matrix the coordinates x c and y c take into account the ship s position in waves 3 ζ t i 1 n a i cos k i x c c o s β y c s i n β ω i t δ i the non linear 6dof model is based on the equations of motions for a rigid ship see eq 4 the numerical model can be defined as hybrid or blended i e non linearities are accounted for restoring and froude krylov actions while radiation and diffraction actions are obtained by linear strip theory potential method and it is based on the assumptions explained in matusiak 2013 4 m a 11 u m q w r v a

terms a ij and k ij are respectively the added mass coefficients corresponding to the infinite frequency and elements of the memory function cummins 1962 modelling radiation actions in irregular sea the terms with the subscript wave include froude krylov diffraction and restoring forces and moments while the terms with the subscript man refer to manoeuvring actions i e further forces acting in the transversal direction and not included in the hull wave interaction the inertia froude krylov and restoring forces and moments are evaluated accounting for all the pertinent non linearities the pressure profile is assumed by applying the so called stretched distribution above the waterline this approach is a kind of extension of the linear wave theory to incorporate the nonlinear effects associated with the variation of the free surface the 3dof and 6dof non linear numerical models for irregular beam waves have been developed from a previous non linear version intended for regular beam waves acanfora and cirillo 2017 cross flow drag was modelled in agreement with cercos pita et al 2016 dealing with regular wave modelling it was possible to account for the viscous roll damping by means of available experimental test coefficients the implemented model demonstrated to properly match roll raos for different types of hull intact condition for which experimental data are available in literature cercos pita et al 2016 acanfora and de luca 2016 in modelling irregular sea damping viscous components are disregarded damping added mass and diffraction forces and moments are calculated beforehand by means of a potential strip theory code faltinsen 1990 and then implemented in the numerical model for irregular waves it is considered quite unnatural to derive non linear damping coefficients quadratic and cubic ittc 2011 from roll decay experiments and insert these into numerical simulations in which large motions and couplings are attained neves 2016 even though the choice of assuming only linear potential damping might be questionable while modelling large ship motions in irregular sea this approach still seems to provide quite satisfactory outcomes ittc 2002 ittc 2005 spanos and palmquist 2009 a limitation in the non linear simulation model for irregular sea is found when local wave amplitudes exceed the freeboard deck height this was already noted for code versions dealing with regular sea simulation results became less accurate for wave amplitudes higher than the freeboard acanfora and cirillo 2017 another limitation in the implemented non linear simulation model is found for large wave steepness especially at small wave periods however very short and high waves are quite rare as observable from the iacs scatter diagram iacs 2001 a proper modelling of the cross flow drag is necessary to account for the forces due to the transversal water velocity in beam waves when using the non linear 6 dof model the superposition of such transversal forces and the other potential seakeeping forces is treated in accordance with acanfora and matusiak 2016 the cross flow drag coefficient cd and the position of the centre of the inherent forces are the main input data for this part of the model the values selected can have a significant influence on the induced heeling moment in the absence of more precise data reference is made to the values suggested in bertram 2000 in the next section however results of a sensitivity analysis on cd values are presented the non linear 3dof model derives from the non linear 6dof one by modelling only heave pitch and roll motions based on this assumption the ship does not move in the horizontal plane and thus no transversal forces are implemented the non linearities of the immersed hull geometry on restoring and froude krylov forces and moments are accounted for radiation and inertial actions are modified in comparison to the 6dof model being disregarded the couplings between sway roll yaw the linear seakeeping 6dof model for irregular sea is realised by the superposition of each regular wave response in time domain calculated beforehand in the frequency domain faltinsen 1990 it is worth recalling that a linear seakeeping model disregards all non linearities on hull geometry and any cross couplings between velocity components the latter implies that the ship can only oscillate around a fixed point in all directions no transversal hull forces in the horizontal plane are needed in the following the three introduced methods implemented in matlab simulink will be applied to the same irregular sea realization to compare and discuss the respective outputs 4 simulations by different models the simulations are carried out on the ro ro pax ship named seatech d whose main characteristics are given in table 1 the hull is discretized by 20500 triangular panels the simulations are all carried out on a sample case characterized by a sea with n 30 nominal hs 7 5m and tz 9 5m for the ship at zero speed in beam waves as anticipated in section 2 the zero crossing period of the irregular sea realizations in time domain tends to shift towards higher values the average values from statistics in the time domain are hs 7 19m tz 10 21s while the nominal input values were as above mentioned hs 7 5m tz 9 5s this scenario does not correspond exactly to a synchronous roll resonance however it can be considered as not too far from it it has been chosen to provide quite large responses without leading to capsize in fig 6 a comparison of the time histories of ship motions by the three different methods is shown as anticipated in section 2 the 3 dof model does not compute surge sway and yaw components while all the linear responses oscillate around a null mean value in the non linear 6dof model a cross flow resistance computed with a drag coefficient cd 0 75 is applied at 65 of the instantaneous draft above the keel line all the simulations last 2 h however for the sake of clarity only a sample time range between 2800s and 4200s is plotted in the figures surge is omitted it is worth reminding that the same irregular wave realization in the time domain has been used in input to the three different prediction methods the different modelling approaches however result in different ship dynamic behaviours and thus in different ship wave relative motions encountered waves in fig 6 the encountered wave ζ at the centre of gravity is shown see eq 3 in fig 7 the inertial accelerations of the ship a iy in the direction of the y axis of the body fixed reference frame obtained by using the time history outputs of velocities and angular velocities are compared among the different methods see eq 5 the subscript 6nl stands for 6dof non linear the subscript 3nl stands for 3dof non linear the subscript 6lin stands for 6dof linear they are calculated at the centre of gravity of the ship thus x s y s z s 0 5 a i y v u r w p r q z s r x s r 2 p 2 y s p z s q p x s f o r 6 n l w p p 2 y s p z s q p x s f o r 3 n l v r x s p z s f o r 6 l i n 6 a i g y a i y g s i n ϕ c o s θ by definition accelerations correspond to inertial loads per unit of mass so the comparison is carried out in terms of accelerations the largest loads are found by the non linear 6 dof method while the outcomes of non linear 3 dof and the linear 6dof methods are noticeably smaller this highlights the impact of accounting for all motion components and interactions when estimating inertial loads including also the gravitational contribution eq 6 however the results of linear and non linear 6 dof methods result to be quite similar see fig 8 the cross flow drag coefficient currently used in all 6dof nl simulations is cd 0 75 fig 9 shows a comparison between the time histories accounting for two additional values of cd cd 1 0 and cd 1 15 it is noted that the values cd 0 75 and cd 1 0 do not show significant differences noticeable differences between the sway yaw and roll arise instead for cd 1 15 compared to the outcomes of the other cd values the highest cross flow drag coefficient induces larger roll motions 5 inertial load estimation according to the iacs scatter diagram this section presents the inertial loads calculated by the time domain numerical modelling in different sea conditions the irregular sea input for the simulations have been derived by applying the technique described in section 2 a total number of 168 sea states was considered with hs ranging between 0 5 m and 13 5m and tz between 4 5s and 15 5s these ranges correspond to the 99 97 of the occurrences reported in the iacs scatter diagram iacs 2001 for each combination of hs and tz a single realization of the sea is derived from the theoretical jonswap spectrum and used as input to the three different numerical models the simulations in all cases with zero forward speed and beam sea last 2 h each the inertial loads per unit mass in the lateral direction a iyg are calculated by applying eq 6 from the obtained time history see for example fig 8 the corresponding distribution of the response peaks a piyg is achieved in the calculation both positive and negative peaks are considered with their absolute values a graphical example by means of normalized histograms is provided in fig 10 the distribution of positive and negative peaks is shown on the left hand side while the corresponding distribution of their absolute values is shown on the right hand side as expected positive and negative peaks are distributed symmetrically around zero with a significant number of occurrences close to zero a threshold for the acceleration peaks is set to s 0 5g where g is the gravitational acceleration the value 0 5g is usually identified as a critical lateral acceleration acanfora et al 2017a shigunov et al 2010 it would correspond statically to a ship heeled by 30 the sea states inducing inertial loads exceeding the threshold value or the capsize of the ship within the time length of the simulation are identified in terms of hs and tz and marked in table 2 in red while the remaining safe ones are marked in green colour this procedure is applied to the numerical results obtained by 6dof non linear 3dof non linear and 6dof linear simulations the linear model shows exceeding cases concentrated in a range of tz between 8 5 and 15 5 s with a pronounced peak at about 12 s where exceedance is obtained even for a comparatively moderate hs value 5 5 m this tz value is in the proximity of the synchronous roll resonance range the corresponding jonswap spectrum features a theoretical peak period tp of about 15 2s close to the linear rolling period of table 1 the non linear models instead show an almost flat border i e not dependent on tz between green and red area at about hs 7 5m for the 6dof non linear method and at 9 5m for the 3dof non linear method as mentioned for the sample case with hs 7 5 m tz 9 5s identified by a black mark in table 2 a number of 200 irregular seas have been simulated and used as input to the 6dof linear and 6dof non linear models for all 200 input wave trains the corresponding h s and t z have been already calculated from the irregular wave time histories and arranged in normalized histograms respectively in figs 2 and 3 referring only to the newly developed technique for sea generation see chapt 2 for each simulation output the inertial load peaks a piyg are studied here peak stands for maximum value in each zero crossing period out of 200 simulations in 57 the threshold s was exceeded at least once using the linear model while with the non linear model exceedance occurred in 196 out of 200 simulations these values are coherent with the position of the black dots in the coloured areas of table 2 the mean values and the variance of the response peaks in each simulation respectively ζap and σap have been computed for both linear and non linear simulation outcomes the mean values ζap of all 200 distributions are shown in fig 11 arranged in normalized histograms 6lin on the left hand side 6nl on the right hand side respectively the ranges of mean values are nearly the same for both the models being comprised between 1 2 m s2 2 8 m s2 the spreading of the hs and tz values actually realised in the sea generation see figs 2 and 3 could be the main responsible for the development of such a large range in particular larger tz i e shifted towards the roll resonance period could trigger larger accelerations with the 6dof linear simulation method a pronounced modal value of ζap close to 1 5 m s2 is identified in the histogram differently from the 6dof non linear outcomes this means that most of the 200 simulations obtained generating different wave trains with the same nominal values of tz and hs provide a mean value of inertial loads in the proximity of 1 5 m s2 while using the non linear model the average value of the response is more varied the same type of comment can be derived by fig 12 where the variance values σap of all 200 distributions arranged in normalized histograms are depicted 6lin on the left hand side 6nl on the right hand side respectively the linear method clearly shows values of σap smaller than the non linear method outcomes with less scattered load values what above can be summarised saying that stable characteristics of the input wave train induce stable characteristics of the load response computed with the linear model while the same is not found for the output of the nonlinear model in other words the latter model has a non stationary behaviour and shows to be more sensitive to the specific time histories of the wave train different from each other than to their statistical properties similar 6 numerical model comparisons with available experiment data in this section a brief validation of the presented numerical models is carried out experimental results regarding the free drifting hull rolling in irregular beam waves at zero speed are not available for the seatech d ship treated above on the other hand the seatech d hull was extensively investigated by experimental model test campaign at the ship laboratory of the aalto university in scenarios corresponding to irregular waves at non zero speeds among the experimental tests carried out on this hull the roll responses in stern quartering seas were analysed in matusiak and stigler 2012 the loading condition in the tests is the same adopted in the analysis reported in the previous sections see table 1 for the sake of a proper comparison with such data the seaetch d hull advancing in irregular beam waves is simulated by an augmented version of the 6dof nl accounting for forward speed effects in the manoeuvring module for a further validation with available experimental data in conditions corresponding to regular beam waves at zero speed an additional hull is simulated and compared such additional hull corresponds to a passenger ferry for which an experimental campaign was carried out at the towing tank of the university of naples heave roll and sway responses were measured and collected in regular beam waves acanfora and de luca 2016 numerical predictions on the passenger ferry are carried out with the three models analysed while for the seatech d hull only the 6dof nl is adopted 6 1 seatech d rolling in irregular stern quartering waves fn 0 222 in this sub section a validation with available experimental data in irregular sea is carried out focusing on the 6dof nl model ship advancing with a froude number of 0 222 for the seatech d hull the available experimental data can be found in matusiak and stigler 2012 stigler 2012 they refer to straight course measurements of roll motions in irregular waves with fn 0 222 and β 45 two sea states characterized by hs 4 8 m and t1 5 9 s and hs 6 0 m and t1 7 7 s respectively are herein simulated and compared with the corresponding experimental results the term t1 is the mean wave period for a jonswap spectrum it holds t1 1 073tz lloyd 1998 the hull model used for the tests in a campaign carried out at the aalto university features a scale of 1 39 for such a simulation scenario characterized by a non null ship velocity the cross flow drag method used for determining the terms with subscript man in the 6dof nl see eq 4 is not adequate to describe hull forces in the horizontal plane addressed as manoeuvring forces therefore it is replaced by a linear manoeuvring model based on hydrodynamic derivatives which are estimated from the semi empirical formulae obtained with the aid of regression analysis see acanfora and matusiak 2016 triantafyllou and hover 2003 the irregular wave realizations in the time domain are obtained from the theoretical jonswap spectrum by applying the technique developed and presented in section 2 despite irregular seas are generated from the same theoretical spectrum assumed in the experiments the simulated wave trains in the time domain can differ from the experimental ones and from each other the fig 13 on the left hand side shows the experimental black line and the simulated orange line roll time histories for the case hs 4 8 m and t1 5 9 s on the right hand side a comparison of the corresponding roll spectra is depicted time and frequency scales refer to model scale comparisons of the simulated data is limited to a time range between 95 s and 135 s where the effective roll motions were measured the remaining experimental time history regarding transient stages is disregarded for additional info please check stigler 2012 in fig 14 the experimental and the numerical results for case hs 6 0 m and t1 7 7 s are arranged in time domain comparisons on the left hand side and frequency domain comparison on the right hand side as previously done the time range is herein limited within 130 s and 170 s for the same aforementioned reasons despite the limited amount of data and the different input wave train in time domain the simulated roll motions fairly reproduce the overall behaviour of the experimental data for both cases this agreement is particularly appreciable in the comparison of roll spectra 6 2 passenger ferry rolling in regular beam waves fn 0 the available experimental data for the passenger ferry are found in acanfora and de luca 2016 the roll data in intact and damage conditions were used for validating a previous version of the 6dof nl code intended for regular waves only acanfora and cirillo 2017 in the current section the roll sway and heave experimental data for the intact hull condition are compared with the outcomes of the simulations by 6dof nl and 6dof lin as above adopted and a 4dof nl roll sway heave pitch the latter model is introduced in this context replacing the 3dof nl roll heave pitch adopted in previous sections this model features still a number of degrees of freedom reduced from 6dof but with the further possibility of comparing sway results the ship model used for the experimental tests features a scale of 1 22 the main particulars in ship scale are given in table 3 the cross drag coefficient is set to cd 1 the chosen hull features a constant deadrise angle and in still water it floats in correspondence to the chine this makes it particularly sensitive to changes in the immersed hull geometry and waterplane area in waves despite the experimental conditions do not involve large motions the 6dof nl the 6dof lin and the 4dof nl i e the augmented 3dof nl models are run for the same wave frequencies adopted in the experimental tests the roll response is presented in the non dimensional form η44 ϕa ka the roll amplitude ϕa corresponds to the half of the difference between maximum and minimum roll response within each cycle k is the wave number and a is the wave amplitude the wave steepness is set to 1 75 the same definition of motion amplitude is used for the heave and sway non dimensional responses η33 za a and η22 ya a respectively in fig 15 the comparison between the three methods for the roll response is shown the 6dof nl model results blue line square marks finely match the experimental data black dashed line round marks the 6dof lin approach green line triangle marks despite neglecting the non linearity of the immersed hull shows a better agreement with the experimental roll results than the 4dof nl orange line cross marks suppression of the cross couplings between roll and yaw in the 4dof nl seems to imply a significant worsening in results probably because such couplings are effective in determining the actual added mass and damping this causes a shift in the resonance frequency of the roll responses obtained by 4dof nl with respect to those by 6dof lin and 6dof nl even though the exact resonant peaks of the roll responses cannot be appreciated from fig 15 since they might fall between the numerically simulated frequencies in fig 16 the comparison between the three methods for the sway response is shown it can be observed that none of the simulation models is fully effective the worst one is still the 4dof nl the cross couplings between sway and yaw that are disregarded in the 4dof nl seem to imply a significant worsening in results also in this case the sway motions calculated by the 6dof nl model are smaller than the 6dof lin model this could be due to an increase in radiation damping caused by considering a total sway velocity including both the oscillating and the stationary drifting part in the 6dof nl see the left hand side of fig 17 the decomposition in mean and filtered signal respectively the 6dof lin model does not describe the stationary drifiting component and features only the oscillatory component around zero right hand side of fig 17 a proper treatment of this computational issue will be addressed in future works on the other hand accounting for the stationary drifting component of sway may be crucial in evaluating the inertial loads by eq 5 similar considerations may apply to yaw motions fig 18 shows the comparisons in terms of heave responses the results of the 6dof lin somewhat interpolate the experimental data with a monotonically decreasing behaviour and larger values than the other methods the 6dof nl finely matches the experimental results only in a few points the 4dof nl model shows similar results compared to the 6dof nl except for the points where larger gaps were found in the corresponding roll and sway responses see figs 15 and 16 in this context heave motions appear therefore to be more sensitive to the non linearities of the immersed hull than to the couplings between roll sway and yaw 7 discussion the presented results should be critically interpreted based on the assumptions and on the limitations of the numerical methods the present study aims at investigating the effect of non linearities in the prediction of motions for a ship exposed to beam seas at zero speed dead ship the non linearities accounted for are those related to the non linear shape of the hull to the cross coupling of different type of motions and to viscous effects related to the water velocities in the transversal direction the hybrid approach implemented is based on the assembly of sub models validated in previous studies additional calculations are carried out in this paper for checking the reliability of the adopted simulation models comparisons with available experimental data show a fair agreement with the 6dof nl model the suppression of degrees of freedom and the assumption of linearity in the 3dof nl and in the 6dof lin respectively seem to lead to less accurate results regarding the 6dof nl there is certainly room for a further development of a unified theory for the ship dynamics combining cross flow drag model and ship motions in irregular beam waves however the applied approach based on the combination of existing sub models seems to be fairly adequate for studying dangerous situations the ship may be subjected to provided that the conditions in the applicability of the code are fulfilled it is worth reminding that as discussed above previous studies indicate that simulation results become less accurate for wave amplitudes higher than the freeboard acanfora and cirillo 2017 in the current context this might affect the reliability of results for hs 9 0m the numerical simulations demonstrated that the complete model including all the non linear effects above mentioned provides larger inertial loads this finding has been substantiated by applying the model on a wide set of sea states see table 2 but in most cases with a single realisation for each sea state even though inadequate for providing a quantitative assessment of the probability of exceeding a given limit nevertheless this approach can be useful for a first screening of critical cases about inertial loads for a specific sea state with hs 7 5 m tz 9 5s more deeply investigated in this paper with 200 realisations it was found that the non linear model in addition to providing larger responses showed to be less stable from a statistical point of view than the linear estimation providing results more dispersed and apparently more related to the specific realisation of the input wave time history this fact may further complicate the analysis as it implies a larger number of simulations in order to capture the statistical characteristics of the response further notes regard the enhancement of the response due to the onset of resonances in the motions in particular roll while in a linear model the resonance frequency is independent from the amplitude the same does not apply to non linear models for which the enhancement of response may be triggered see wawrzyński and krata 2016 in certain sea state realizations by peculiar combinations of wave amplitude and frequency together with large yaw motions indeed a proper interpretation of the non linear roll enhancement in irregular sea is still missing 8 conclusions a comparative analysis among three models for the prediction of ship inertial loads in the time domain was carried out based on the same set of irregular sea realizations in input to the models the investigation regards a specific vessel in a dead ship condition zero forward speed no manoeuvring capabilities and beam sea this accidental situation is particularly prone to the onset of severe roll motions and strong inertial loads on the cargo on deck and retaining devices it is therefore a good candidate for assessing inertial loads and developing design criteria for the retention system a technique allowing for a fine matching of the zero order moment of the wave spectrum with a smaller number of discrete components in comparison to standard procedures was developed and applied the simulation outcomes suggest that non linear models provide larger loads due to superposition and cross couplings of ship motions a limited number of degrees of freedom could still model roll motions however it might misrepresent the risk of cargo shifting especially in areas far away from the ship centre of gravity by using linear modelling inertial loads can be considered as a stationary process dominated by synchronous roll resonance phenomena the outcomes of non linear models reveal on the contrary non stationary properties possibly due to the effect of non linearities on the roll phenomena the 6dof linear model shows to be robust but not necessarily the most realistic one in predicting critical scenarios indeed the 6dof non linear model still needs refinements in the implementation especially regarding the coupling of transversal forces and seakeeping and a detailed analysis of the effects in terms of non stationary response and non linear resonance 
22976,the prediction of breaking wave loads is challenging in ocean engineering due to air entrapment and compressibility in order to investigate air compressibility effects in different modes of breaking wave impact a two phase compressible flow model is proposed a high order finite difference method constrained interpolation profile cip method is employed to discretize the navier stokes equations and the interface is captured by tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme the present compressible model is validated against several tests 1 d gravity induced liquid piston motion idealized free drop of water patch impact and dam break experiments special attention of this study is paid to breaking wave impacts on a vertical wall in a liquid sloshing tank for air entrapped impact the results of cip based compressible model are in good agreement with experimental data it is shown that the air compressibility leads to high frequency oscillation of the impact pressure which cannot be reproduced by the incompressible model it is found that the oscillation of the impact pressure is synchronized with the compression and expansion of the entrapped air pocket and the oscillation frequency is related to the size of air pocket for air water mixing impact the oscillation of the pressure may be more intense keywords compressibility effect wave impact cip method numerical model 1 introduction breaking waves may cause significant damages to offshore and coastal structures due to large impact pressure oumerici 1994 accurate predictions of wave loading induced by breaking wave are crucial in engineering applications many experimental studies have been conducted to investigate breaking wave loading on structures lugni et al 2006 bullock et al 2007 according to oumeraci et al 1993 and lugni et al 2010a three different modes of wave impacts may exist i pure water impact which occurs before wave breaking with no air entrapped or entrained ii air entrapped impact which occurs when the wave crest is rushing to structures with air entrapped iii broken wave air water mixing impact which occurs after wave breaking with air water mixing when air is trapped or entrained in breaking waves mode ii the entrapped compressible air makes the impact process more complicated bagnold 1939 investigated the influence of air and found that the appearance of pressure peaks is associated with the compressibility of air air pockets entrapped between water and structure act as cushions at the moment of impact the compressibility of air may cause pressure oscillations and lead to a longer loading period takahashi et al 1985 it is demonstrated that single phase flow models do not reproduce pressure oscillations caused by air compressibility bredmose et al 2009 2015 summarized the effect of aeration in violent wave impact and concluded that the aeration reduced the pressure peak for all impact types for both of modes ii and iii the air compressibility shows a little influence on impact pressure in most of the laboratory tests whereas wave loads in full scale measurements are generally lower than those measured in scaled laboratory tests cuomo et al 2010 a possible reason for this observation is that the atmospheric pressure cannot be scaled properly in laboratory tests cuomo et al 2009 therefore the numerical simulation that fully considers compressibility is a good complement to laboratory experiments various incompressible two phase flow models have been developed and widely applied such as vof based volume of fluid methods hirt and nichols 1981 kleefsman et al 2005 zhao et al 2010 sph smoothed particle hydrodynamic methods sun et al 2010 didier et al 2014 openfoam based models jacobsen et al 2012 hu et al 2016 cip based models yabe et al 2001 hu et al 2009 he 2013 etc incompressible two phase flow models treat both water and air as incompressible fluids which neglects the compressibility effect in practical problems such as air entrapped or air water mixing wave impact mentioned above in the studies with compressible two phase flow models different numerical models have been proposed guo et al 2011 developed a vof based compressible two phase flow model using a finite volume method fvm and found that air entrapped impact would cause pressure oscillations guilcher et al 2010 presented a compressible sph based flow model and simulated wave impacting on a vertical rigid wall with an air pocket lind et al 2015 compared a compressible two phase sph model with a single phase sph model in wave slamming problems and found that the single phase model over predicted the impact pressure gao et al 2015 set up a compressible flow model using open source cfd library openfoam and pointed out that there is a plateau of the pressure peak in an air entrapped impact but not in a flip through impact ma et al 2014 used a high order finite volume scheme to set up a compressible air water mixture model and simulated a series of violent aerated impact motions the compressible solver proposed by ma et al 2014 captured the sub atmospheric pressure which could not be captured by incompressible flow models ma et al 2016 have also investigated air enclosed wave impacts in liquid sloshing based on openfoam and figured out that the strongest oscillation of pressure occurs near the entrapped air and is caused by the expansion and contraction of the air pocket for two phase flow problems there will be a large density gradient at the interface between air and water and subtle changes in density can cause spurious pressure oscillations especially for compressible problems in contrast to the above mentioned numerical approaches the constrained interpolation profile cip method is a high order finite difference scheme which has higher accuracy in dealing with discontinuities or large gradients hu and kashiwagi 2009 ji et al 2017 the cip method which was developed by takewaki et al 1985 1987 has been used in multiphase flow models yabe et al 2001 hu and kashiwagi 2004 2009 introduced a cip based two phase flow model to simulate strongly nonlinear wave body interaction problems then zhao et al 2012 he 2013 zhao 2013 zhao et al 2014 ji et al 2017 and wang et al 2018 have fully applied the cip method in incompressible multiphase flow simulations and verified the accuracy of this method in solving the problems of wave structure interaction and large deformation of free surface the objective of this paper is to extend the application of the cip method and using a compressible numerical model to study air entrapped and air water mixing wave impact problems few reports are available for the application of the cip method in compressible models hu and kashiwagi 2004 mentioned in dam break impact problems that the results of compressible and incompressible models have little difference this may be due to the fact that no air is entrapped during the dam break impact yang and qiu 2012 applied a cip based compressible model in slamming problems and proposed that a negative pressure appeared at the bottom of the plate when entering the water in contrast to hu and kashiwagi 2004 and yang and qiu 2012 the free surface is calculated by the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme in the present study the thinc is a vof type method and more accurate than original cip method for interface capturing xiao et al 2005 the technique enables to deal with nonlinear violent free surface deformation problems and has been fully validated by hu and kashiwagi 2009 he 2013 ji et al 2017 and wang et al 2018 in addition the treatment of pressure and density is different from hu and kashiwage 2004 or yang and qiu 2012 in our model we established a relationship between pressure and density by using wood s sound speed formulation and the stiffened gas equation of state detailed information will be shown in section 2 1 the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the details of the numerical model including the governing equations and cip method are described in section 3 validation tests are performed and the necessity of compressibility is discussed in section 4 the verified model is used to investigate the compressibility effect of air air water mixing in liquid sloshing impact problems conclusions are drawn in the last section 2 mathematical method a homogeneous model is proposed both water and air phases are assumed to be in mechanical equilibrium with identical velocity and pressure the phases are tracked by solving volume fraction function zhao 2013 1 φ m t u φ m 0 where u is the velocity t is the time and φ m represents the volume fraction of water and air with m 1 2 corresponding to water and air phase respectively the method of interface capturing is the thinc more details can be seen in xiao et al 2005 method by solving the volume fraction different phases can be defined note that φ 1 φ 2 1 the physical properties of air and water mixtures such as denstity ρ and viscosity μ could be determined using following equation λ φ 1 λ 1 φ 2 λ 2 where λ represents the property of interest 2 1 governing equations for a typical compressible model conservation equations momentum equations and energy equations are usually considered most wave impact problems occur in open environments and the effects of temperature are negligible so in the present model the energy equation is not taken into account the equations representing conservation of mass and momentum take the form 2 ρ t ρ u 0 3 u t u u f 1 ρ p μ ρ 2 u where p is the pressure and f is the external force assuming there is no temperature variation the equation of state eos is chosen to describe the relationship between ρ and p 4 p f ρ for eos the sound speed definition c s d p d ρ gives a relationship using eq 4 eq 2 can be expressed as 5 p t u p ρ c s 2 u according to kieffer 1977 the speed of sound in air water mixture is not linearly related to the ratio of water and air volume fractions here the wood s sound speed formulation is adopted 6 c s 1 ρ φ 1 ρ 1 c 1 2 φ 2 ρ 2 c 2 2 where c 1 and c 2 denote the speed of sound in water and air respectively the stiffened gas equation of state s eos is chosen to identify c 1 and c 2 saurel and abgrall 1999 7 c γ p 0 κ ρ 0 where p 0 is the ambient pressure ρ 0 is the initial density of water or air γ and κ are physical properties of air and water with γ 1 4 the flow is assumed as isentropic and κ 0 for air γ 7 15 and κ 308 mpa for water respectively eq 2 eq 3 and eq 5 constitute the governing equations for compressible fluids in order to apply the cip method fractional step approach is chosen 2 2 the fractional step approach for eq 2 eq 3 and eq 5 the fractional step approach divides the solution of the equations into three steps hu and kashiwagi 2004 1 advection phase 8 ρ t u ρ 0 9 u t u u 0 10 p t u p 0 the advection phase is computed by the cip method the intermediate values of u ρ and p can be obtained 2 non advection phase i 11 u t f μ ρ 2 u for the non advection phase i euler explicit scheme is used for time integration and central difference scheme

for χ the transportation equation for ζ is obtained 21 ζ t u ζ ζ u the advection phase of χ and ζ can be computed by cip method the intermediate values χ and ζ are 22 χ x χ ˆ n x u δ t 23 ζ x ζ ˆ n x u δ t where χ ˆ n is an interpolation approximation to χ n and χ ˆ n is constructed by the two dimensional cip scheme more details can be seen in yabe et al 2004 3 model validation tests in order to verify the performance of the present model a number of validation tests have been carried out the problems are reproduced to test the capability of the model to handle compressible fluids including ideal one dimensional gravity induced liquid piston motion and two dimensional liquid patch free drop problems classical dam break problems are used to test the model s ability to capture the free surface and calculate the wave impact pressures 3 1 1 d gravity induced liquid piston motion gravity induced liquid piston motion problem has been chosen as a benchmark test dias 2010 the initial condition of this problem is shown in fig 1 left where a 15 m long closed pipe is filled with air and water a water column 8 m in height is surrounded by air in the middle of the pipe and is 2 m above the ground at the initial moment the initial pressure in the whole pipe is standard atmospheric pressure p atm and the initial density of air is 1 kg m3 and the density of water is 1000 kg m3 the water column would drop firstly because of gravity the air at both ends of the water column would be affected by the movement of the water column the air in the bottom would be compressed and the air in the top would expanse in return the change in pressure caused by the compression and expansion of air will affect the movement of the water column when the pressure generated by air is greater than the gravity of the water column the water column starts to decelerate and finally moves upwards without considering friction the water column will keep moving up and down like a piston the density of air at both sides will also change with the pressure firstly the convergence of the grid is investigated the time step t is 0 1 ms and 1 d uniform meshes with y 0 2 m y 0 1 m y 0 05 m and y 0 025 m are simulated according to figs 2 a 0 05 m is chosen as the final size of grids 300 1 d uniform meshes are set along the pipe the pressure and density at the bottom and the top are both recorded as shown in fig 2 b 2 d the compressible cip results are compared with those by ma et al 2014 in detail when the pressure at the bottom reaches the maximum 2 856 bar the pressure at the top decreases to the minimum 0 764 bar under the influence of pressure the density of air would change greatly the maximum density of air at the bottom is 2 116 kg m3 and at the corresponding moment the density of air at the top is 0 825 kg m3 the change in pressure and density has a good periodicity this demonstrated that the present method is feasible and robust for simulating the compressibility of air 3 2 idealized free drop of water patch impact a two dimensional idealized benchmark test was implemented which was first proposed by braeuning et al 2009 as shown in fig 1 right in a rectangular tank with 15 m in height and 20 m in width a water patch the density is 1000 kg m3 is still in air 2 m above the ground the volume of the water patch is 10 m by 8 m and is 5 m away from the left and the right walls the background pressure in the tank is p atm and the density of air is 1 kg m3 under gravity the water patch would accelerate down and hit the ground in this case a structured uniform grid is selected along x direction there are 400 meshes x 0 05 m and along y direction two sizes of mesh y 0 05 m and y 0 025 m are selected the initial maximum time step t is predetermined as 1 ms and it would be automatically updated to satisfy the cfl condition in the subsequent calculations the four boundaries are set as no slip boundary conditions the pressure in the middle of the bottom is concerned and discussed in fig 3 the pressure results of cip based model are compared with level set rafiee et al 2015 sph guilcher et al 2010 and fvm method ma et al 2014 in the compressible model for two sizes of grids the time series of pressure is consistent with the sph method and the fvm method the impact occurred around 0 63 s and the pressure reached the peak at about 0 65 s it could be 25 bar the slamming process last to 0 68 s and then all compressible models simulated a process of pressure below p atm the results of incompressible cip and level set methods rafiee et al 2015 are different from the other compressible results peak pressure occurred earlier and after the peak the pressure is always higher than p atm fig 3 the reason for these visible differences is that slamming occurs before the pure water fully touched the ground the first part that impacts on the ground is the mixture of air and water which in numerical simulation is the air water interface as bullock et al 2001 pointed out aeration in water buffered the impact which reduced the peak pressure the cushion effect of the interface in compressible models slows down the rise of pressure and makes the peak pressure show up later which is similar to the effect of aeration in water in addition compressible air also acts as a cushion for the fine grid y 0 025 m the peak impact pressure about 35 bar is greater than those of compressible models this means there is no cushioning effect in the incompressible model for the compressible cip model how the volume fraction of water changes is also presented in fig 4 the maximum pressure occurs when the water body fully impacts on the ground at 0 65 s after that a thin layer of air appears between the water and the ground at 0 7 s the air layer results in a pressure value below p atm gradually the air layer is concentrated toward the center forming an air cushion 0 8 s the entrapped air is then compressed 0 85 s when considering compressibility the interface and the air between the water and the ground causes a cushioning effect which reduces the pressure peak and delays the peak moreover negative pressure would occur in the compressible model due to the expansion of air in this view it is necessary to consider the compressibility effect in wave impact problems 3 3 interface capturing and impact pressure tests dam break problems dam break problems have been investigated experimentally by many researchers martin and moyce 1952 dressler 1954 hu and sueyoshi 2010 the initial condition is shown in fig 5 a the length of l is 14 6 cm in martin et al s experiment and 20 cm in hu et al s in dressler s experiment the dimension of the tank is larger and the initial height 2l of the water is 11 cm once the gate was opened the water column would collapse due to gravity and then the collapsed water flow would rush to the right wall the whole process includes complicated free surface motions wave breaking water air mixing and violent impacts we compared the experimental data with the numerical simulations in dimensionless the numerical setup is identical to hu and sueyoshi 2010 s experiment uniform grids are chosen and there are 400 meshes in x direction and 300 meshes in y direction fig 5 b shows the time history of the water front location along the ground the sola vof method hirt and nichols 1981 is also presented for comparison it can be found that the result of the cip method is close to the experimental data of dressler 1954 and hu et al 2010 the numerical result shows a slight difference from martin and moyce s 1952 experiment data this may be caused by the gate removal technique lobovsky et al 2014 ye et al 2016 in the later stage the present model is superior to sola vof method for interface capturing although thinc is a vof type method it can refine the interface and stabilize the interface in fewer grids xiao et al 2005 he 2013 these demonstrate that the cip based model can be used to deal with the free surface deformation in order to test the ability of the cip based compressible model to calculate wave impact pressure we computed another dam break experiment which was conducted by hu and kashiwagi 2004 the initial conditions are shown in fig 6 and a pressure gauge is set at the back boundary wall 1 cm above the ground a variable grid is adopted for this problem and the mesh is refined near the pressure gauge 0 4 mm in minimum the numerical results are compared with the experimental data as shown in fig 7 the results from both compressible and incompressible models show a good agreement with the experimental results on the key trends as shown in fig 7 the impact pressure reaches the peak rapidly at 0 35 s the result of the compressible model shows a little difference with that of incompressible one because this impact is a pure water impact mode i there is no compressibility effect without air entrapped the pressure value gradually decreases after the peak after the water jet reaches its highest point and begins to fall the impact pressure goes through a slow growth period after 0 45 s at 0 75 s the pressure peak appears again after the water front turns back to the left wall the impact pressure decreases gradually the results of the compressible model show that the pressure predicted by the compressible model oscillates slightly when the second peak appeared compared with experimental results the cip method has a good performance in capturing the free surface and calculating the impact pressure after all the tests it is demonstrated that the present cip based compressible model cannot only simulate the air compression and expansion but also simulate the wave impact process of two phase flow it can reproduce the formation and development of the air cushion during an impact event for the calculation of the wave impact pressure which we concern the cip based model shows its accuracy in dam break problem 4 wave impacts in a sloshing tank 4 1 validation of sloshing firstly a sloshing without violent impact air entrapped air water mixing impact is simulated to validate the cip based compressible model the experiment was conducted by koh et al 2012 in which a square sloshing tank is 0 6 m in both width and height still water depth in the tank is 0 3 m a wave gauge h 1 is located by the ceiling with 20 mm away from the right boundary to measure the free surface elevation and a pressure sensor p 1 is installed on the left wall which is 20 mm above the bottom the tank is excited horizontally with a sinusoidal law x a 1 c o s ω 0 t where the amplitude a is 5 mm and the natural frequency ω 0 of the tank is 6 86 rad s the convergence of the grids is verified in numerical simulations uniform meshes are chosen with three different sizes 4 mm 3 mm and 2 mm in both x direction and y direction the time step t is predetermined as 1 ms in the calculations the four walls are all treated as non slip boundaries as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 the time histories of free surface elevation and pressure calculated by cip based method are compared with experimental data and level set method bai et al 2015 the numerical results are in good agreement with the experiment and the two finer grids show good convergence after 7 s numerical results show a small phase difference from the experiment which may be due to the fact that the actual frequency in the experiment is not consistent with numerical simulation koh et al 2012 the results of cip based model are closer to experimental data than level set method at the trough especially for the pressure fig 9 4 2 investigation of wave impacts in sloshing in this section the cip based compressible model is applied in breaking wave impacts caused by liquid sloshing to discuss the air compressibility effects and the formation of air pockets the numerical modeling is compared with the experimental results of lugni et al 2010b here we simulate the experiment of lugni et al 2010b under the same conditions as shown in fig 10 in a depressurized 750 mbar tank of 1 m by 1 m the water depth is 0 125 m the tank oscillates horizontally with a sinusoidal law a s i n 2 π t where the amplitude a 3 cm and the period t 1 6 s five pressure gauges are set on the left side boundary p 1 at y 13 cm above the bottom boundary p 2 at y 15 cm p 3 at y 17 cm p 4 at y 19 cm and p 5 at y 21 cm variable grids are chosen with refined meshes near the pressure gauge 1 mm minimum in both x direction and y direction the maximum time step t is predetermined as 1 ms and the adaptive time step is subjected to cfl condition and automatically updated in the simulations for each impact the time step t is smaller than 0 05 ms the four boundaries are all treated as no slip boundary conditions fig 11 is an overview of the experimental and numerical pressure results at p 4 a relative pressure referred to the background pressure of 750 mbar the sampling rate of the pressure gauges is 16000 hz in the experiments and 20000 hz in the simulations as shown in fig 11 b during air entrapped impacts the results of the compressible model show oscillations and negative pressure values which are in agreement with the experimental data as lugni et al 2010a and 2010b pointed out when the air is entrapped in the impact water the compression and expansion of the air pockets cause the pressure oscillation lugni et al 2010b identified the typical process of pressure evolution as three regimes fig 11 b a first peak which is induced by the inertia of the high speed impact water b oscillation which is caused by the compression and expansion of the entrapped air c nonviolent pressure which is mainly caused by the gravity of the upward water the incompressible and compressible models are compared in fig 11 b both models could simulate regime a first pressure peak and regime c nonviolent pressure but only the compressible model could reproduce regime b oscillations in the experiment air entrapped impact first occurred when the third impact event fig 11 a happened and the discussions focused on this impact event a detailed comparison between our numerical simulations and the experimental data of this event is shown in fig 12 the moment of the maximum pressure peak is defined as t 0 s the maximum peak pressure simulated by incompressible cip model is close to the experimental data at p 4 and p 5 and a little smaller at p 1 p 3 however the overall trend of the incompressible model does not match the experiment the pressures remain positive and there are no oscillations the compressible model shows better agreement with the experiment fig 12 for the first and highest peak pressure process the peak value and the oscillation phenomenon of the pressure are reproduced at p 5 by the compressible model at p 1 p 4 the changes in pressure the process of oscillation are simulated accurately except that the pressure peaks are slightly lower than experimental data because a tiny change will affect the volume of air entrapped which then affect the impact pressure as ma et al 2016 pointed out a possible tiny under or over shoot of the excitation amplitude may cause the air pocket close earlier for pressure oscillation process the period of pressure is simulated accurately at p 1 p 3 p 4 and p 5 show differences in phase with the experiment and the numerical results have shorter periods a possible reason is the boundary effect friction from the third direction which may slow down the motion of the fluid abrahamsen et al 2011 in fig 12 we have also given the pressure variation at the left side bottom of the tank p 0 and the pressure will oscillate accordingly which is affected by the pocket above compared with the incompressible model the cip based compressible model improves the reproduction of air entrapped wave impacts and the accuracy of pressure calculations in order to gain a better understanding of breaking wave impacts we compared the first to the eighth wave impact events the time series of impact pressure are shown in fig 13 and the moment of each highest peak is defined as t 1 to t 8 the snapshots of the pressure field in which the black line represents the interface where φ 0 5 and distributions of the pressure along the vertical wall are shown from fig 14 to fig 20 as it is illustrated in the introduction there are three modes of wave impact i pure water impact ii air entrapped impact and iii broken wave air water mixing impact the first the fourth and the seventh impact events are all pure water impact mode i and no plunging wave happens the impact pressures reach the maximum rapidly and then decrease gradually but remain positive we can see from fig 11 a that the results of the compressible model have little difference from the incompressible model in these three events as can be seen from fig 13 the fourth impact pressure is greater than the first one this is mainly because the initial sloshing of water is not violent enough however comparing fig 14 with fig 15 the shape of incident waves explains the main reason for the pressure difference in pure water impact the crest of the incident wave at t 4 3 ms is higher than the water surface at the vertical wall the incident wave has a lower crest at t 1 3 ms the peak pressure at t 4 which caused by the higher incident wave is much greater than that at t 1 the third impact event is a typical air entrapped one mode ii as shown in fig 16 the maximum pressure 19 2 kpa occurs at t 3 where the water tongue is rushing to the wall and the air pocket sealed by the left wall and the tongue of water reduces the impact pressure to less than 15 kpa after 2 5 ms the air pocket expands and the pressure inside experiences the first trough which has a negative value meantime all pressures inside the pocket are negative but a positive load remains at the tongue of water at about t 3 5 ms the pocket is compressed and the maximum pressure occurs inside the pocket which is the second pressure peak then after a short time the pressure falls to the second trough with a similar trend to the first one with the compression and expansion of air in the pocket the pressure oscillates the pressure crest and trough are climbing upward with the pocket as shown in fig 16 the process of the sixth wave impact event is similar to the third one but the size of the entrapped air pocket is larger which results in a longer pressure oscillation period as shown in figs 13 and 17 from the first peak crest to trough it takes 4 5 ms whereas the third event only requires 2 5 ms then after 4 5 ms it experiences a second pressure crest as the pressure oscillates the air pocket gradually moves upward and at t 6 37 ms a clear water jet forms inside by t 6 54 ms the internal jet divides the pocket into two parts as can be seen from the figures the change of pressure in the upper pocket is not violent as that in the lower one the second impact event is between mode i and mode ii with a greater pressure peak than other events as bredmose et al 2010 pointed out the maximum impact pressure occurs when an ideal flip through impact with the largest possible steepness without air involved has been achieved however this impact event is neither a pure water impact nor an entrapped one in the numerical simulations a small bubble is formed at the tongue of water fig 18 though peak pressure occurs in the bubble the bubble flattens the peak a little the small bubble even causes the pressure on the wall to be negative at t 2 4 ms if we only observe the movement of the water surface in fig 19 or the time series of pressure at t 5 the fifth impact event may be defined as another typical air entrapped impact however as shown in the pressure field the oscillation of pressure does not always occur inside the entrapped air pocket a negative pressure value appears in an area outside the pocket this area is filled with small bubbles forming an air water mixing impact so the fifth event is an impact that combines mode ii and mode iii both the entrapped air pocket and air bubbles act as cushions at t 5 and the air bubbles air water mixing cause more violent pressure oscillations as shown in fig 13 the pressures at p 1 and p 2 change greater and shorter fig 20 shows a broken wave impact where pockets are formed before the impact occurs the pockets complicate the time series of pressure the peak pressure at each sensor shows an obvious time phase shift the eighth impact event in fig 13 with the water climbing with pockets each pressure sensor reaches its peak from the bottom to the top as shown in fig 13 the maximum pressure in this impact is only 7 kpa at t 8 4 ms which is much lower than other events except the first one 5 conclusion an efficient compressible two phase flow model based on a high order finite difference scheme is presented in this paper the cip method is employed to discretize the equations and the thinc scheme is implemented for the calculating of the free surface firstly compressible effects are verified by simulating simplified 1 d gravity induced liquid piston motion and 2 d free drop of water patch impact problems and the accuracy of this model is compared with other methods in the 2 d problem it is found that the air between water and ground acts as a cushion which reduces impact pressure and the expansion of air results in negative pressure secondly to examine the model s ability to deal with large deformation of surface and wave impact problems dam break experimental tests are computed the numerical results agree well with the experimental data indicating that the present model has good performance in free surface capturing and impact pressure calculating thirdly the convergence and accuracy of the cip based compressible model are also verified by comparing with sloshing experiments a detailed comparison with experimental data of air entrapped impact is presented and the compressible model reproduces the process of impact pressure well especially the process of pressure oscillation the present computations confirm that the cip based compressible two phase flow model is an effective numerical tool for dealing with air air water mixing compressibility effect problems especially in breaking wave impacts which is an extension to cip method finally detailed computations are presented to study three modes of wave impacts 1 for a pure water wave impact event the impact pressure reaches the maximum rapidly and then decreases gradually and remains positive impact loads are mainly affected by the height of incident wave crest to water surface at the vertical wall 2 for an air entrapped wave impact the time evolution of pressure is more complex than the pure water impact the maximum slamming pressure is caused by the tongue of water which is close to the entrapped air pocket the air pocket acts as a cushion reducing the impact loads but with oscillations happened inside the negative pressure value is caused by the expansion of the air pocket the size of entrapped air is the main factor affecting the frequency of pressure oscillation the bigger the air pocket is the longer the oscillation period would be 3 for broken wave impacts air water mixing impacts the pockets or bubbles may also act as cushions for fully air water mixing small bubbles formed inside water wave impacts the oscillation of pressure is more intense 
22976,the prediction of breaking wave loads is challenging in ocean engineering due to air entrapment and compressibility in order to investigate air compressibility effects in different modes of breaking wave impact a two phase compressible flow model is proposed a high order finite difference method constrained interpolation profile cip method is employed to discretize the navier stokes equations and the interface is captured by tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme the present compressible model is validated against several tests 1 d gravity induced liquid piston motion idealized free drop of water patch impact and dam break experiments special attention of this study is paid to breaking wave impacts on a vertical wall in a liquid sloshing tank for air entrapped impact the results of cip based compressible model are in good agreement with experimental data it is shown that the air compressibility leads to high frequency oscillation of the impact pressure which cannot be reproduced by the incompressible model it is found that the oscillation of the impact pressure is synchronized with the compression and expansion of the entrapped air pocket and the oscillation frequency is related to the size of air pocket for air water mixing impact the oscillation of the pressure may be more intense keywords compressibility effect wave impact cip method numerical model 1 introduction breaking waves may cause significant damages to offshore and coastal structures due to large impact pressure oumerici 1994 accurate predictions of wave loading induced by breaking wave are crucial in engineering applications many experimental studies have been conducted to investigate breaking wave loading on structures lugni et al 2006 bullock et al 2007 according to oumeraci et al 1993 and lugni et al 2010a three different modes of wave impacts may exist i pure water impact which occurs before wave breaking with no air entrapped or entrained ii air entrapped impact which occurs when the wave crest is rushing to structures with air entrapped iii broken wave air water mixing impact which occurs after wave breaking with air water mixing when air is trapped or entrained in breaking waves mode ii the entrapped compressible air makes the impact process more complicated bagnold 1939 investigated the influence of air and found that the appearance of pressure peaks is associated with the compressibility of air air pockets entrapped between water and structure act as cushions at the moment of impact the compressibility of air may cause pressure oscillations and lead to a longer loading period takahashi et al 1985 it is demonstrated that single phase flow models do not reproduce pressure oscillations caused by air compressibility bredmose et al 2009 2015 summarized the effect of aeration in violent wave impact and concluded that the aeration reduced the pressure peak for all impact types for both of modes ii and iii the air compressibility shows a little influence on impact pressure in most of the laboratory tests whereas wave loads in full scale measurements are generally lower than those measured in scaled laboratory tests cuomo et al 2010 a possible reason for this observation is that the atmospheric pressure cannot be scaled properly in laboratory tests cuomo et al 2009 therefore the numerical simulation that fully considers compressibility is a good complement to laboratory experiments various incompressible two phase flow models have been developed and widely applied such as vof based volume of fluid methods hirt and nichols 1981 kleefsman et al 2005 zhao et al 2010 sph smoothed particle hydrodynamic methods sun et al 2010 didier et al 2014 openfoam based models jacobsen et al 2012 hu et al 2016 cip based models yabe et al 2001 hu et al 2009 he 2013 etc incompressible two phase flow models treat both water and air as incompressible fluids which neglects the compressibility effect in practical problems such as air entrapped or air water mixing wave impact mentioned above in the studies with compressible two phase flow models different numerical models have been proposed guo et al 2011 developed a vof based compressible two phase flow model using a finite volume method fvm and found that air entrapped impact would cause pressure oscillations guilcher et al 2010 presented a compressible sph based flow model and simulated wave impacting on a vertical rigid wall with an air pocket lind et al 2015 compared a compressible two phase sph model with a single phase sph model in wave slamming problems and found that the single phase model over predicted the impact pressure gao et al 2015 set up a compressible flow model using open source cfd library openfoam and pointed out that there is a plateau of the pressure peak in an air entrapped impact but not in a flip through impact ma et al 2014 used a high order finite volume scheme to set up a compressible air water mixture model and simulated a series of violent aerated impact motions the compressible solver proposed by ma et al 2014 captured the sub atmospheric pressure which could not be captured by incompressible flow models ma et al 2016 have also investigated air enclosed wave impacts in liquid sloshing based on openfoam and figured out that the strongest oscillation of pressure occurs near the entrapped air and is caused by the expansion and contraction of the air pocket for two phase flow problems there will be a large density gradient at the interface between air and water and subtle changes in density can cause spurious pressure oscillations especially for compressible problems in contrast to the above mentioned numerical approaches the constrained interpolation profile cip method is a high order finite difference scheme which has higher accuracy in dealing with discontinuities or large gradients hu and kashiwagi 2009 ji et al 2017 the cip method which was developed by takewaki et al 1985 1987 has been used in multiphase flow models yabe et al 2001 hu and kashiwagi 2004 2009 introduced a cip based two phase flow model to simulate strongly nonlinear wave body interaction problems then zhao et al 2012 he 2013 zhao 2013 zhao et al 2014 ji et al 2017 and wang et al 2018 have fully applied the cip method in incompressible multiphase flow simulations and verified the accuracy of this method in solving the problems of wave structure interaction and large deformation of free surface the objective of this paper is to extend the application of the cip method and using a compressible numerical model to study air entrapped and air water mixing wave impact problems few reports are available for the application of the cip method in compressible models hu and kashiwagi 2004 mentioned in dam break impact problems that the results of compressible and incompressible models have little difference this may be due to the fact that no air is entrapped during the dam break impact yang and qiu 2012 applied a cip based compressible model in slamming problems and proposed that a negative pressure appeared at the bottom of the plate when entering the water in contrast to hu and kashiwagi 2004 and yang and qiu 2012 the free surface is calculated by the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc scheme in the present study the thinc is a vof type method and more accurate than original cip method for interface capturing xiao et al 2005 the technique enables to deal with nonlinear violent free surface deformation problems and has been fully validated by hu and kashiwagi 2009 he 2013 ji et al 2017 and wang et al 2018 in addition the treatment of pressure and density is different from hu and kashiwage 2004 or yang and qiu 2012 in our model we established a relationship between pressure and density by using wood s sound speed formulation and the stiffened gas equation of state detailed information will be shown in section 2 1 the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the details of the numerical model including the governing equations and cip method are described in section 3 validation tests are performed and the necessity of compressibility is discussed in section 4 the verified model is used to investigate the compressibility effect of air air water mixing in liquid sloshing impact problems conclusions are drawn in the last section 2 mathematical method a homogeneous model is proposed both water and air phases are assumed to be in mechanical equilibrium with identical velocity and pressure the phases are tracked by solving volume fraction function zhao 2013 1 φ m t u φ m 0 where u is the velocity t is the time and φ m represents the volume fraction of water and air with m 1 2 corresponding to water and air phase respectively the method of interface capturing is the thinc more details can be seen in xiao et al 2005 method by solving the volume fraction different phases can be defined note that φ 1 φ 2 1 the physical properties of air and water mixtures such as denstity ρ and viscosity μ could be determined using following equation λ φ 1 λ 1 φ 2 λ 2 where λ represents the property of interest 2 1 governing equations for a typical compressible model conservation equations momentum equations and energy equations are usually considered most wave impact problems occur in open environments and the effects of temperature are negligible so in the present model the energy equation is not taken into account the equations representing conservation of mass and momentum take the form 2 ρ t ρ u 0 3 u t u u f 1 ρ p μ ρ 2 u where p is the pressure and f is the external force assuming there is no temperature variation the equation of state eos is chosen to describe the relationship between ρ and p 4 p f ρ for eos the sound speed definition c s d p d ρ gives a relationship using eq 4 eq 2 can be expressed as 5 p t u p ρ c s 2 u according to kieffer 1977 the speed of sound in air water mixture is not linearly related to the ratio of water and air volume fractions here the wood s sound speed formulation is adopted 6 c s 1 ρ φ 1 ρ 1 c 1 2 φ 2 ρ 2 c 2 2 where c 1 and c 2 denote the speed of sound in water and air respectively the stiffened gas equation of state s eos is chosen to identify c 1 and c 2 saurel and abgrall 1999 7 c γ p 0 κ ρ 0 where p 0 is the ambient pressure ρ 0 is the initial density of water or air γ and κ are physical properties of air and water with γ 1 4 the flow is assumed as isentropic and κ 0 for air γ 7 15 and κ 308 mpa for water respectively eq 2 eq 3 and eq 5 constitute the governing equations for compressible fluids in order to apply the cip method fractional step approach is chosen 2 2 the fractional step approach for eq 2 eq 3 and eq 5 the fractional step approach divides the solution of the equations into three steps hu and kashiwagi 2004 1 advection phase 8 ρ t u ρ 0 9 u t u u 0 10 p t u p 0 the advection phase is computed by the cip method the intermediate values of u ρ and p can be obtained 2 non advection phase i 11 u t f μ ρ 2 u for the non advection phase i euler explicit scheme is used for time integration and central difference scheme for spatial derivatives the second intermediate values are obtained 12 u u δ t f μ ρ 2 u 3 non advection phase ii 13 ρ t ρ u 14 u t 1 ρ p 15 p t ρ c 2 u take divergence of eq 14 and substitute u by eq

x i 1 δ t u i x i by solving this equation in the whole computation domain we can obtain the pressure field p n 1 then the density ρ n 1 and the velocity u n 1 can be obtained by 18 u n 1 u δ t 1 ρ p n 1 19 ρ n 1 ρ δ t ρ u n 1 for the incompressible model instead of solving eq 2 the density can be obtain directly by the function of volume fraction ρ φ 1 ρ 1 φ 2 ρ 2 hu and kashiwagi 2004 the volume fraction changes continuously across the interface 2 3 cip method all the advection phase equations have the same form 20 χ t u χ 0 by differentiating eq 11 to the spatial coordinates and ζ standing for χ the transportation equation for ζ is obtained 21 ζ t u ζ ζ u the advection phase of χ and ζ can be computed by cip method the intermediate values χ and ζ are 22 χ x χ ˆ n x u δ t 23 ζ x ζ ˆ n x u δ t where χ ˆ n is an interpolation approximation to χ n and χ ˆ n is constructed by the two dimensional cip scheme more details can be seen in yabe et al 2004 3 model validation tests in order to verify the performance of the present model a number of validation tests have been carried out the problems are reproduced to test the capability of the model to handle compressible fluids including ideal one dimensional gravity induced liquid piston motion and two dimensional liquid patch free drop problems classical dam break problems are used to test the model s ability to capture the free surface and calculate the wave impact pressures 3 1 1 d gravity induced liquid piston motion gravity induced liquid piston motion problem has been chosen as a benchmark test dias 2010 the initial condition of this problem is shown in fig 1 left where a 15 m long closed pipe is filled with air and water a water column 8 m in height is surrounded by air in the middle of the pipe and is 2 m above the ground at the initial moment the initial pressure in the whole pipe is standard atmospheric pressure p atm and the initial density of air is 1 kg m3 and the density of water is 1000 kg m3 the water column would drop firstly because of gravity the air at both ends of the water column would be affected by the movement of the water column the air in the bottom would be compressed and the air in the top would expanse in return the change in pressure caused by the compression and expansion of air will affect the movement of the water column when the pressure generated by air is greater than the gravity of the water column the water column starts to decelerate and finally moves upwards without considering friction the water column will keep moving up and down like a piston the density of air at both sides will also change with the pressure firstly the convergence of the grid is investigated the time step t is 0 1 ms and 1 d uniform meshes with y 0 2 m y 0 1 m y 0 05 m and y 0 025 m are simulated according to figs 2 a 0 05 m is chosen as the final size of grids 300 1 d uniform meshes are set along the pipe the pressure and density at the bottom and the top are both recorded as shown in fig 2 b 2 d the compressible cip results are compared with those by ma et al 2014 in detail when the pressure at the bottom reaches the maximum 2 856 bar the pressure at the top decreases to the minimum 0 764 bar under the influence of pressure the density of air would change greatly the maximum density of air at the bottom is 2 116 kg m3 and at the corresponding moment the density of air at the top is 0 825 kg m3 the change in pressure and density has a good periodicity this demonstrated that the present method is feasible and robust for simulating the compressibility of air 3 2 idealized free drop of water patch impact a two dimensional idealized benchmark test was implemented which was first proposed by braeuning et al 2009 as shown in fig 1 right in a rectangular tank with 15 m in height and 20 m in width a water patch the density is 1000 kg m3 is still in air 2 m above the ground the volume of the water patch is 10 m by 8 m and is 5 m away from the left and the right walls the background pressure in the tank is p atm and the density of air is 1 kg m3 under gravity the water patch would accelerate down and hit the ground in this case a structured uniform grid is selected along x direction there are 400 meshes x 0 05 m and along y direction two sizes of mesh y 0 05 m and y 0 025 m are selected the initial maximum time step t is predetermined as 1 ms and it would be automatically updated to satisfy the cfl condition in the subsequent calculations the four boundaries are set as no slip boundary conditions the pressure in the middle of the bottom is concerned and discussed in fig 3 the pressure results of cip based model are compared with level set rafiee et al 2015 sph guilcher et al 2010 and fvm method ma et al 2014 in the compressible model for two sizes of grids the time series of pressure is consistent with the sph method and the fvm method the impact occurred around 0 63 s and the pressure reached the peak at about 0 65 s it could be 25 bar the slamming process last to 0 68 s and then all compressible models simulated a process of pressure below p atm the results of incompressible cip and level set methods rafiee et al 2015 are different from the other compressible results peak pressure occurred earlier and after the peak the pressure is always higher than p atm fig 3 the reason for these visible differences is that slamming occurs before the pure water fully touched the ground the first part that impacts on the ground is the mixture of air and water which in numerical simulation is the air water interface as bullock et al 2001 pointed out aeration in water buffered the impact which reduced the peak pressure the cushion effect of the interface in compressible models slows down the rise of pressure and makes the peak pressure show up later which is similar to the effect of aeration in water in addition compressible air also acts as a cushion for the fine grid y 0 025 m the peak impact pressure about 35 bar is greater than those of compressible models this means there is no cushioning effect in the incompressible model for the compressible cip model how the volume fraction of water changes is also presented in fig 4 the maximum pressure occurs when the water body fully impacts on the ground at 0 65 s after that a thin layer of air appears between the water and the ground at 0 7 s the air layer results in a pressure value below p atm gradually the air layer is concentrated toward the center forming an air cushion 0 8 s the entrapped air is then compressed 0 85 s when considering compressibility the interface and the air between the water and the ground causes a cushioning effect which reduces the pressure peak and delays the peak moreover negative pressure would occur in the compressible model due to the expansion of air in this view it is necessary to consider the compressibility effect in wave impact problems 3 3 interface capturing and impact pressure tests dam break problems dam break problems have been investigated experimentally by many researchers martin and moyce 1952 dressler 1954 hu and sueyoshi 2010 the initial condition is shown in fig 5 a the length of l is 14 6 cm in martin et al s experiment and 20 cm in hu et al s in dressler s experiment the dimension of the tank is larger and the initial height 2l of the water is 11 cm once the gate was opened the water column would collapse due to gravity and then the collapsed water flow would rush to the right wall the whole process includes complicated free surface motions wave breaking water air mixing and violent impacts we compared the experimental data with the numerical simulations in dimensionless the numerical setup is identical to hu and sueyoshi 2010 s experiment uniform grids are chosen and there are 400 meshes in x direction and 300 meshes in y direction fig 5 b shows the time history of the water front location along the ground the sola vof method hirt and nichols 1981 is also presented for comparison it can be found that the result of the cip method is close to the experimental data of dressler 1954 and hu et al 2010 the numerical result shows a slight difference from martin and moyce s 1952 experiment data this may be caused by the gate removal technique lobovsky et al 2014 ye et al 2016 in the later stage the present model is superior to sola vof method for interface capturing although thinc is a vof type method it can refine the interface and stabilize the interface in fewer grids xiao et al 2005 he 2013 these demonstrate that the cip based model can be used to deal with the free surface deformation in order to test the ability of the cip based compressible model to calculate wave impact pressure we computed another dam break experiment which was conducted by hu and kashiwagi 2004 the initial conditions are shown in fig 6 and a pressure gauge is set at the back boundary wall 1 cm above the ground a variable grid is adopted for this problem and the mesh is refined near the pressure gauge 0 4 mm in minimum the numerical results are compared with the experimental data as shown in fig 7 the results from both compressible and incompressible models show a good agreement with the experimental results on the key trends as shown in fig 7 the impact pressure reaches the peak rapidly at 0 35 s the result of the compressible model shows a little difference with that of incompressible one because this impact is a pure water impact mode i there is no compressibility effect without air entrapped the pressure value gradually decreases after the peak after the water jet reaches its highest point and begins to fall the impact pressure goes through a slow growth period after 0 45 s at 0 75 s the pressure peak appears again after the water front turns back to the left wall the impact pressure decreases gradually the results of the compressible model show that the pressure predicted by the compressible model oscillates slightly when the second peak appeared compared with experimental results the cip method has a good performance in capturing the free surface and calculating the impact pressure after all the tests it is demonstrated that the present cip based compressible model cannot only simulate the air compression and expansion but also simulate the wave impact process of two phase flow it can reproduce the formation and development of the air cushion during an impact event for the calculation of the wave impact pressure which we concern the cip based model shows its accuracy in dam break problem 4 wave impacts in a sloshing tank 4 1 validation of sloshing firstly a sloshing without violent impact air entrapped air water mixing impact is simulated to validate the cip based compressible model the experiment was conducted by koh et al 2012 in which a square sloshing tank is 0 6 m in both width and height still water depth in the tank is 0 3 m a wave gauge h 1 is located by the ceiling with 20 mm away from the right boundary to measure the free surface elevation and a pressure sensor p 1 is installed on the left wall which is 20 mm above the bottom the tank is excited horizontally with a sinusoidal law x a 1 c o s ω 0 t where the amplitude a is 5 mm and the natural frequency ω 0 of the tank is 6 86 rad s the convergence of the grids is verified in numerical simulations uniform meshes are chosen with three different sizes 4 mm 3 mm and 2 mm in both x direction and y direction the time step t is predetermined as 1 ms in the calculations the four walls are all treated as non slip boundaries as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 the time histories of free surface elevation and pressure calculated by cip based method are compared with experimental data and level set method bai et al 2015 the numerical results are in good agreement with the experiment and the two finer grids show good convergence after 7 s numerical results show a small phase difference from the experiment which may be due to the fact that the actual frequency in the experiment is not consistent with numerical simulation koh et al 2012 the results of cip based model are closer to experimental data than level set method at the trough especially for the pressure fig 9 4 2 investigation of wave impacts in sloshing in this section the cip based compressible model is applied in breaking wave impacts caused by liquid sloshing to discuss the air compressibility effects and the formation of air pockets the numerical modeling is compared with the experimental results of lugni et al 2010b here we simulate the experiment of lugni et al 2010b under the same conditions as shown in fig 10 in a depressurized 750 mbar tank of 1 m by 1 m the water depth is 0 125 m the tank oscillates horizontally with a sinusoidal law a s i n 2 π t where the amplitude a 3 cm and the period t 1 6 s five pressure gauges are set on the left side boundary p 1 at y 13 cm above the bottom boundary p 2 at y 15 cm p 3 at y 17 cm p 4 at y 19 cm and p 5 at y 21 cm variable grids are chosen with refined meshes near the pressure gauge 1 mm minimum in both x direction and y direction the maximum time step t is predetermined as 1 ms and the adaptive time step is subjected to cfl condition and automatically updated in the simulations for each impact the time step t is smaller than 0 05 ms the four boundaries are all treated as no slip boundary conditions fig 11 is an overview of the experimental and numerical pressure results at p 4 a relative pressure referred to the background pressure of 750 mbar the sampling rate of the pressure gauges is 16000 hz in the experiments and 20000 hz in the simulations as shown in fig 11 b during air entrapped impacts the results of the compressible model show oscillations and negative pressure values which are in agreement with the experimental data as lugni et al 2010a and 2010b pointed out when the air is entrapped in the impact water the compression and expansion of the air pockets cause the pressure oscillation lugni et al 2010b identified the typical process of pressure evolution as three regimes fig 11 b a first peak which is induced by the inertia of the high speed impact water b oscillation which is caused by the compression and expansion of the entrapped air c nonviolent pressure which is mainly caused by the gravity of the upward water the incompressible and compressible models are compared in fig 11 b both models could simulate regime a first pressure peak and regime c nonviolent pressure but only the compressible model could reproduce regime b oscillations in the experiment air entrapped impact first occurred when the third impact event fig 11 a happened and the discussions focused on this impact event a detailed comparison between our numerical simulations and the experimental data of this event is shown in fig 12 the moment of the maximum pressure peak is defined as t 0 s the maximum peak pressure simulated by incompressible cip model is close to the experimental data at p 4 and p 5 and a little smaller at p 1 p 3 however the overall trend of the incompressible model does not match the experiment the pressures remain positive and there are no oscillations the compressible model shows better agreement with the experiment fig 12 for the first and highest peak pressure process the peak value and the oscillation phenomenon of the pressure are reproduced at p 5 by the compressible model at p 1 p 4 the changes in pressure the process of oscillation are simulated accurately except that the pressure peaks are slightly lower than experimental data because a tiny change will affect the volume of air entrapped which then affect the impact pressure as ma et al 2016 pointed out a possible tiny under or over shoot of the excitation amplitude may cause the air pocket close earlier for pressure oscillation process the period of pressure is simulated accurately at p 1 p 3 p 4 and p 5 show differences in phase with the experiment and the numerical results have shorter periods a possible reason is the boundary effect friction from the third direction which may slow down the motion of the fluid abrahamsen et al 2011 in fig 12 we have also given the pressure variation at the left side bottom of the tank p 0 and the pressure will oscillate accordingly which is affected by the pocket above compared with the incompressible model the cip based compressible model improves the reproduction of air entrapped wave impacts and the accuracy of pressure calculations in order to gain a better understanding of breaking wave impacts we compared the first to the eighth wave impact events the time series of impact pressure are shown in fig 13 and the moment of each highest peak is defined as t 1 to t 8 the snapshots of the pressure field in which the black line represents the interface where φ 0 5 and distributions of the pressure along the vertical wall are shown from fig 14 to fig 20 as it is illustrated in the introduction there are three modes of wave impact i pure water impact ii air entrapped impact and iii broken wave air water mixing impact the first the fourth and the seventh impact events are all pure water impact mode i and no plunging wave happens the impact pressures reach the maximum rapidly and then decrease gradually but remain positive we can see from fig 11 a that the results of the compressible model have little difference from the incompressible model in these three events as can be seen from fig 13 the fourth impact pressure is greater than the first one this is mainly because the initial sloshing of water is not violent enough however comparing fig 14 with fig 15 the shape of incident waves explains the main reason for the pressure difference in pure water impact the crest of the incident wave at t 4 3 ms is higher than the water surface at the vertical wall the incident wave has a lower crest at t 1 3 ms the peak pressure at t 4 which caused by the higher incident wave is much greater than that at t 1 the third impact event is a typical air entrapped one mode ii as shown in fig 16 the maximum pressure 19 2 kpa occurs at t 3 where the water tongue is rushing to the wall and the air pocket sealed by the left wall and the tongue of water reduces the impact pressure to less than 15 kpa after 2 5 ms the air pocket expands and the pressure inside experiences the first trough which has a negative value meantime all pressures inside the pocket are negative but a positive load remains at the tongue of water at about t 3 5 ms the pocket is compressed and the maximum pressure occurs inside the pocket which is the second pressure peak then after a short time the pressure falls to the second trough with a similar trend to the first one with the compression and expansion of air in the pocket the pressure oscillates the pressure crest and trough are climbing upward with the pocket as shown in fig 16 the process of the sixth wave impact event is similar to the third one but the size of the entrapped air pocket is larger which results in a longer pressure oscillation period as shown in figs 13 and 17 from the first peak crest to trough it takes 4 5 ms whereas the third event only requires 2 5 ms then after 4 5 ms it experiences a second pressure crest as the pressure oscillates the air pocket gradually moves upward and at t 6 37 ms a clear water jet forms inside by t 6 54 ms the internal jet divides the pocket into two parts as can be seen from the figures the change of pressure in the upper pocket is not violent as that in the lower one the second impact event is between mode i and mode ii with a greater pressure peak than other events as bredmose et al 2010 pointed out the maximum impact pressure occurs when an ideal flip through impact with the largest possible steepness without air involved has been achieved however this impact event is neither a pure water impact nor an entrapped one in the numerical simulations a small bubble is formed at the tongue of water fig 18 though peak pressure occurs in the bubble the bubble flattens the peak a little the small bubble even causes the pressure on the wall to be negative at t 2 4 ms if we only observe the movement of the water surface in fig 19 or the time series of pressure at t 5 the fifth impact event may be defined as another typical air entrapped impact however as shown in the pressure field the oscillation of pressure does not always occur inside the entrapped air pocket a negative pressure value appears in an area outside the pocket this area is filled with small bubbles forming an air water mixing impact so the fifth event is an impact that combines mode ii and mode iii both the entrapped air pocket and air bubbles act as cushions at t 5 and the air bubbles air water mixing cause more violent pressure oscillations as shown in fig 13 the pressures at p 1 and p 2 change greater and shorter fig 20 shows a broken wave impact where pockets are formed before the impact occurs the pockets complicate the time series of pressure the peak pressure at each sensor shows an obvious time phase shift the eighth impact event in fig 13 with the water climbing with pockets each pressure sensor reaches its peak from the bottom to the top as shown in fig 13 the maximum pressure in this impact is only 7 kpa at t 8 4 ms which is much lower than other events except the first one 5 conclusion an efficient compressible two phase flow model based on a high order finite difference scheme is presented in this paper the cip method is employed to discretize the equations and the thinc scheme is implemented for the calculating of the free surface firstly compressible effects are verified by simulating simplified 1 d gravity induced liquid piston motion and 2 d free drop of water patch impact problems and the accuracy of this model is compared with other methods in the 2 d problem it is found that the air between water and ground acts as a cushion which reduces impact pressure and the expansion of air results in negative pressure secondly to examine the model s ability to deal with large deformation of surface and wave impact problems dam break experimental tests are computed the numerical results agree well with the experimental data indicating that the present model has good performance in free surface capturing and impact pressure calculating thirdly the convergence and accuracy of the cip based compressible model are also verified by comparing with sloshing experiments a detailed comparison with experimental data of air entrapped impact is presented and the compressible model reproduces the process of impact pressure well especially the process of pressure oscillation the present computations confirm that the cip based compressible two phase flow model is an effective numerical tool for dealing with air air water mixing compressibility effect problems especially in breaking wave impacts which is an extension to cip method finally detailed computations are presented to study three modes of wave impacts 1 for a pure water wave impact event the impact pressure reaches the maximum rapidly and then decreases gradually and remains positive impact loads are mainly affected by the height of incident wave crest to water surface at the vertical wall 2 for an air entrapped wave impact the time evolution of pressure is more complex than the pure water impact the maximum slamming pressure is caused by the tongue of water which is close to the entrapped air pocket the air pocket acts as a cushion reducing the impact loads but with oscillations happened inside the negative pressure value is caused by the expansion of the air pocket the size of entrapped air is the main factor affecting the frequency of pressure oscillation the bigger the air pocket is the longer the oscillation period would be 3 for broken wave impacts air water mixing impacts the pockets or bubbles may also act as cushions for fully air water mixing small bubbles formed inside water wave impacts the oscillation of pressure is more intense 
22977,this paper presents a two dimensional parametric analysis of the influence of an internal slug flow on the structural dynamic response of flexible risers the parametric analysis allow us to study the behaviour of the parameters involved in the dynamic response of flexible risers with an internal slug flow such as displacements top tension and bending moment when any of the parameters characterizing the slug flow is modified to accomplish this goal a computational tool is developed the spatial discretization of the riser is performed using beam finite elements and the corotational approach is used for the two dimensional formulation of the beam element the beam elements have a linear elastic behaviour and they are submitted to large displacements although with small deformations the incremental iterative newton raphson scheme for follower loads is used to solve the equilibrium equations in dynamic analysis time domain numerical integration is performed using the constant average acceleration method the slug flow is viewed as a single phase fluid with variable density which is modelled by a periodic function the numerical results show good coherence when compared to the experimental ones qualifying the computational tool to conduct parametric studies about dynamic of flexible marine risers with an internal slug flow keywords structural dynamic response large displacements corotational formulation slug flow 1 introduction in oil and gas exploration and production operations in deep and ultra deep water flexible risers are widely used to connect a subsea pipeline to a deep water floating or fixed oil production platform because their high resistance to external and internal pressures when exposed at great depths flexible risers have become the primary candidates to be used with floating production platforms in future ultra deep water operations of the oil and gas industry the internal fluid moving inside the riser is a mixture of oil gas and water and it is exposed to different conditions of pressure and temperature these characteristics make the modelling of the internal fluid a highly complex task in this work the slug flow is considered as the pattern of the internal fluid the dynamic response of risers with an internal slug flow is a topic that has been little studied by riser mechanic researchers in the last decades mainly because of the challenge of mathematically modelling the internal slug flow the work carried out by patel and seyed 1989 is among the few references found about this topic in their work to represent the slug flow the authors proposed a simplified one dimensional model based on the sinusoidal behaviour of the internal fluid density along the riser the authors performed experiments using a reduced riser model in which the internal fluid was composed of a mixture of water and air the authors conclude that the effects of the dynamic slug flows can cause large fluctuating tensions on the riser wu and lou 1991 developed a mathematical model to study the effects of an internal fluid and bending rigidity of the pipe on the dynamic behaviour of flexible risers the authors concluded that bending rigidity had a great influence on the dynamic response of riser when the internal fluid flows at high velocities chucheepsakul et al 2003 developed mathematical formulations for the treatment of large strains in extensible flexible marine risers transporting fluid in this work is introduced the apparent tension concept utilized in the present work which was proposed to represent the effect of the external and internal pressures on the axial force acting on the riser monprapussorn et al 2007 studied the influence of the internal pulsatile flow on the dynamic response of flexible risers by means of a parametric analysis the authors concluded that the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid velocity amplifies significantly the top tension and the displacements in the upper region of the riser valdivia 2008 conducted experiments to determine the influence of an internal two phase flow composed of water and air on the dynamic response of a silicone pipe reduced riser model also the author obtained numerical results for the top tension and for the vertical displacement at the mid point of the silicone pipe using the slug flow model proposed by patel and seyed 1989 on the basis of the experimental results the author concluded that the high oscillation amplitudes of the top tension and displacements of the pipe are due to the fact that the response frequencies of the pipe are close to the natural frequencies of the same one polio and mossa pollio and mossa 2008 based on the slug flow model proposed by patel and seyed 1989 made comparisons between two simplified models of slug flow the first model considers a constant slug wavelength along the riser and the other model considers the slug flow wavelength as a function of the riser inclination that is to say with variable slug wavelength along the riser yamamoto 2011 studied experimentally the effect of an internal fluid on the dynamic behaviour of vertical pipes in the results the author observed that the natural frequency of the pipes has the tendency to decrease when the flow rates increases ortega 2015 studied numerically the influence of an internal slug flow on the dynamic response of flexible risers using a computational tool consisting of one program for prediction of slug flow development using a lagrangian tracking model and another program for calculation of the dynamic response of flexible risers the author concluded that the centripetal force and the effective weight variations caused by the slug flow produce fluctuations of the effective top tension the corotational formulation of beam elements with elastic deformations has proven to be efficient for the study of slender structures with large displacements crisfield 1991 and yaw 2009 one of the great advantages of the corotational approach is that allows to separate the rigid body motion from the deformational motion of the structural element in this work the corotational approach has also been used to describe the kinematics of a riser element the present work carries out a two dimensional parametric analysis focusing on the influence of an internal slug flow on the dynamic response of flexible risers the works of patel and seyed 1989 valdivia 2008 and polio and mossa pollio and mossa 2008 calculate the forces caused by the internal fluid on a flexible riser from the application of the linear momentum equation for a finite control volume that encloses an element of riser in this work we calculate the forces caused by the internal fluid using the absolute acceleration of the fluid particles taking into account the relative motion between internal fluid and riser 2 two dimensional formulation for beams for the two dimensional formulation of beams the corotational approach formulated by yaw 2009 has been used the beam element is considered as a structure that performs two types of movement translation and rotation after that it suffers deformations caused by its internal forces consider a typical beam element in its initial and current configurations as shown in fig 1 from fig 1 the beam element in its initial configuration is defined by the global coordinates x 1 y 1 for node 1 and x 2 y 2 for node 2 in its current configuration the node number 1 of the beam element is defined by x 1 u 1 y 1 v 1 and θ 1 and the node number 2 is defined by x 2 u 2 y 2 v 2 and θ 2 where u 1 and v 1 are the horizontal and vertical displacement of node 1 respectively u 2 and v 2 are the horizontal and vertical displacement of node 2 and θ 1 and θ 2 are the rotation angles of the nodes number 1 and 2 respectively which are measured starting from its initial position two coordinates systems are used in the corotational approach the global coordinate system x y and the local corotating coordinate system t n where the direction of t is given by the straight line between the nodal points 1 and 2 in the current configuration from fig 1 the global displacement vector u and the local displacement vector u l are defined as the following 1 u u 1 v 1 θ 1 u 2 v 2 θ 2 t 2 u l u θ 1 l θ 2 l t where u is the local axial displacement of the beam element θ 1 l and θ 2 l are the local rotations of nodes 1 and 2 respectively the components of u l are calculated according to 3 u l l 0 4 θ 1 l θ 1 β β 0 5 θ 2 l θ 2 β β 0 from eqs 3 5 l 0 and l are the measures of the distance between the nodes 1 and 2 in the initial and the current configuration of the beam element respectively and β 0 and β are the measures of the inclination of the local coordinates system in its initial and current configuration respectively with regards to the global coordinates system 2 1 calculus of the tangent stiffness matrix of a beam element the tangent stiffness matrix k t for a beam element is calculated in accordance with the expression proposed by crisfield 1991 which was also used by yaw 2009 6 k t b t c l b n l z z t m 1 m 2 l 2 r z t z r t where n is the axial force which is considered constant along the beam element and the local end moments m 1 and m 2 acting on the nodal points 1 and 2 respectively b c l z and r are defined by 7 b cos β sin β 0 cos β sin β 0 sin β l cos β l 1 sin β l cos β l 0 sin β l cos β l 0 sin β l cos β l 1 8 c l e a l 0 1 0 0 0 4 r 2 2 r 2 0 2 r 2 4 r 2 9 z sin β cos β 0 sin β cos β 0 t 10 r cos β sin β 0 cos β sin β 0 t where a is the cross sectional area of the beam element and r is the radius of gyration which is defined as r i a the local displacements for a point of the beam element the local transverse displacement and the local rotations are approximated using the conventional cubic polynomial being the local transverse displacements zero at the two ends see crisfield 1991 3 acting loads on flexible risers the acting loads on an element of riser are shown in fig 2 a p e is the external pressure due to the seawater and p i is the internal pressure due to the internal fluid t w is the true wall tension v is the shear force and m is the bending moment f fn and f ft are the acting forces due to the internal fluid in the normal and tangential direction to the riser element axis respectively f m is the force due to the current the force caused by the current is calculated using the morison equation for which the normal component approach is used the normal component approach considers that the normal forces to the scr element are the predominant ones whereas the tangential forces are not taken into account w r is the own weight of the riser fig 2 b shows an equivalent forces system where t a is the apparent tension acting on the riser and w a is the apparent weight of the riser the procedure to obtain the equivalent forces system has been performed by chucheepsakul et al 2003 in subsections 3 1 to 3 4 the forces acting on an element of riser will be explained and subsection 3 5 deals with the procedure to obtain the external force vector applied on the structural nodes of the riser 3 1 apparent tension in a production riser fluids act internally and externally generating hydrostatic static and dynamic pressures in this work the concept of apparent tension is used to represent the combined effect of the external and internal pressures and the true wall tension acting on an element of riser the apparent tension t a and the true wall tension t w are related by means of the following equation see ref chucheepsakul et al 2003 11 t a t a t ˆ t w 2 ν p e a e p i a i t ˆ where ν is the poisson s coefficient while a e and a i are the external and internal area of the transversal section of the riser respectively if the internal fluid is flowing with a velocity v the following relationship is obtained 12 t a t a t ˆ t w 2 ν p e a e p i a i ρ f v 2 a i t ˆ where ρ f is the density of the internal fluid the apparent tension affects the stiffness matrix of each element of riser in this work to determine the stiffness matrix for each element of riser calculated using equation 6 the axial force n is substituted by t a then the true wall tension t w is calculated from eq 12 3 2 apparent weight the concept of apparent weight is used to represent the combined effect of the weight of the riser and the buoyancy forces owing to the external and internal fluids acting on the riser see ref sparks 1984 the apparent weight is a distributed force per unit of length in the vertical direction considering a differential element of length ds the apparent weight of the riser element w a ds can be calculated by adding the archimedian upthrust owing to the seawater ρ w a e g d s and the weight of the contained fluid ρ f a e g d s to the true weight of the pipe w r ds then the following relationship is obtained 13 w a w r ρ f a i g ρ w a e g where w a and w r are the apparent weight and the true weight of the riser per unit of length respectively ρ f is the density of the internal fluid and ρ w is the density of the seawater 3 3 loads due to the internal fluid consider a fluid finite system moving with a local velocity v and acceleration a the newton s second law establishes that 14 d f r a d m where f r is the resultant force which acts on the fluid finite system and dm is a differential element of the fluid mass this force is applied by the riser element on the internal fluid the force applied by the internal fluid on the riser element has the same value but opposite direction and therefore the force due to the internal fluid can be calculated as 15 d f f a d m where f f is the force vector owing to the dynamics of the internal fluid from eq 15 and using d m ρ f a i d s the force owing to the internal fluid per unit of length of riser f f can be calculated as 16 f f ρ f a i a the acceleration of a fluid particle moving inside the riser is calculated using the expression given by shames 2003 17 a a l r 2 ω v ω r ω ω r where a is the acceleration in the global system of coordinates x y z and a l is the acceleration in the local coordinate system t n b on the right side of eq 17 the third term represents the coriolis acceleration the fourth term represents the acceleration caused by the angular acceleration of the local system t n b and the fifth term represents the centripetal acceleration considering a small element of riser as shown in fig 3 this can be approximate as a straight line from fig 3 the point c of the riser element mid point of the element and origin of the local corotating coordinate system t n b is determined by the position vector r and r is the position vector of the particle fluid in the local corotating coordinate system t n b the vectors r and r are expressed by 18 r x c u c i ˆ y c v c j ˆ 19 r s t ˆ the vector v represents the velocity vector of the fluid particle in the local corotating coordinate system t n b which rotates around vector b with an angular velocity ω vectors v and ω are determined by the following expressions 20 v v t ˆ 21 ω β k ˆ and the local acceleration of the fluid particle is given by 22 a l v t ˆ substituting eqs 18 22 in eq 17 and applying the coordinate transformation the expression for the acceleration of the internal fluid is obtained 23 a u c cos β v c sin β v β 2 s t ˆ v c cos β u c sin β 2 β v β s n ˆ where the horizontal and vertical accelerations of the mid point of the riser element u c and v c respectively can be determined by interpolation on the nodal accelerations of the element finally substituting eq 23 into eq 16 the force owing to the internal fluid per unit of length of riser is calculated to calculate the force vector owing to the internal fluid the force per unit of length eq 16 must be concentrated in the nodes of the riser element the velocity of the slug flow v will be defined once the mathematical model is known the model to represent the slug flow will be treated below 3 3 1 mathematical model of slug flow the slug flow is characterized by large bubbles of gas also called taylor bubbles which have a diameter almost equal to the riser diameter separated by slugs of continuous liquid which contain small gas bubbles as showed in fig 4 from fig 4 d e and d i are the external and internal diameter of the riser respectively and l l and l g are the length of the liquid slug and the taylor bubble respectively and l s is the slug wavelength to represent the changes in density of the slug flow owing to the mixture of gas and liquid phases the slug flow was modelled as a single phase fluid having a variable density which varies periodically in relation to the arc length and to the moment in time in this work the mathematical model used is the one proposed by patel and seyed 1989 which is expressed by the following equation 24 ρ f ρ 0 ρ s sin κ s ψ e i ω t where ρ 0 is the average density between the liquid phase density ρ l and the gas phase density ρ g ρ s is the amplitude of density variations κ 2 π l s is the slug wave number s is the arc length of the riser at this point ω is the slug circular frequency and ψ is the angle phase in this work it is considered that the slug flow travels inside the riser with a constant frequency as a consequence the slug lengths are also constant along the riser in a real riser because of the riser inclination the slug flow frequency is variable once the geometry of the slug flow is known we proceed to calculate the velocity of a slug flow particle to do that we start by calculating the total mass flow rate of the slug flow which is calculated for a mixture of water and gas as 25 m q l ρ l q g ρ g where q l and q g are the volumetric flow rate of liquid and gas respectively from the work of santos 2006 and taitel et al 1980 the flow rates of liquid and gas can be expressed as a function of the liquid superficial velocities v sl and the gas superficial velocity v sg as follows 26 q l v s l a i q g v s g a i the local velocity of a fluid particle of slug flow can be calculated using the continuity equation conservation of mass then substituting variables the following equation is obtained 27 v v s l ρ l v s g ρ g ρ f m ρ f a i the total flow rate calculated as the sum of q l and q g can be utilized to obtain a relationship between the slug wavelength l s and the slug circular frequency ω by means of the following equation 28 ω q l q g l s a i 3 4 loads due to current the hydrodynamic loads caused by the current acting on a slanting cylinder can be calculated by using the morison equation in this work as mentioned before the normal component approach will be used which considers that only velocities and accelerations normal to the riser element generate forces from fig 5 v c is the current velocity v t and v n are the current velocity in the tangent and normal direction respectively u n and u n are the components of velocity and acceleration of the riser in the normal direction to the cylinder axis respectively and f m is the morison s force per unit of length the force caused by the current per unit of length is expressed by see patel 2013 29 f m 1 2 c d ρ w d e v n u n v n u n c m ρ w v n π d e 2 4 c a ρ w u n π d e 2 4 where c d c m and c a are the drag inertia and added mass coefficients respectively and ρ w is the density of seawater v n is the component of the acceleration of the seawater in the normal direction to the cylinder axis 3 5 load vector applied to structural nodes of an element of riser in the preceding subsections the external forces acting on an element of riser the apparent weight the force owing to the dynamic of the internal fluid and the force caused by the current were presented in the form of distributed loads however for the purposes of this study these forces must be expressed as concentrated forces in the global coordinate system x y which act on the structural nodes of the riser element this section explains how to convert distributed loads into consistent nodal loads to perform this conversion the distributed loads must be expressed in the local corotating coordinate system t n in the following way f f t t ˆ f n n ˆ where f t is the distributed force in the tangential direction and f n is the distributed force in the normal direction the external force vector r in the local corotating coordinate system is calculated by 30 r l 1 l 2 n t f t f n d s where n is the matrix that contains the shape functions of the riser element and have the following form 31 n n 1 0 0 n 2 0 0 0 n 3 n 4 0 n 5 n 6 from eq 31 n 1 and n 2 are the lagrangian linear shape functions while n 3 n 4 n 5 and n 6 are the lagrange cubic shape functions after obtaining the external force vector in the local corotating coordinate system the external force vector r in global coordinates can be obtained from the following rotation 32 r t r where t is the rotation matrix that transforms a vector from local system to global system and r is the external load vector in the global system the rotation matrix t is expressed by 33 t cos β sin β 0 0 0 0 sin β cos β 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 cos β sin β 0 0 0 0 sin β cos β 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 equilibrium equations and numerical methods the dynamic response of flexible risers the objective of this paper is calculated from its static equilibrium configuration see fig 6 in this section the equilibrium equations for the dynamic analysis are presented as well as the numerical method for its solution from fig 6 h is the sea depth and d is the horizontal displacement of the floating platform in relation to the axis y the coordinates x and y represent the position of a point p of the riser in the static equilibrium configuration p represents the point p in the dynamic configuration at a certain time t and u and v are the horizontal and vertical displacements of the point p respectively in order to determine the dynamic response of flexible risers the equilibrium equation and the numerical methods for their solution are presented below 4 1 dynamic analysis

initial conditions at time t 0 35 u t 0 u 0 0 a n d u t 0 u 0 0 where m is the global mass matrix that is the sum of the global matrix of mass structure the global matrix of added mass of the surrounding water and the global matrix of mass due to internal slug flow c is the global damping matrix that is the sum of the struct5u7yural damping matrix which is estimated using the rayleigh

acceleration method is used to calculate the dynamic response of the riser see ref chopra 2012 5 results and analysis the results obtained using the computational code developed in this work will be compared with the experimental results obtained by valdivia 2008 the objective is to show that the computational code produces numerical results that are consistent with the experimental ones 5 1 comparison between experimental and numerical results the experiment consisted in making the water and air go through a reduced riser model fig 7 shows the test facility components the reduced model of the riser consisted of a silicone pipe of 28 7 m beginning as a horizontal line of 10 7 m and ending at the touch down point tdp which coincides with node number 1 then a pipe in catenary of 18 m in length follows it as presented in fig 8 the geometric characteristics and mechanical properties of the reduced model of the riser are listed in table 1 the experiments conducted were carried out in the air and thus the current forces were not considered in the calculations the considered liquid was water with a density of 998 kg m3 and the gas considered was air at atmospheric pressure with a density of 1 21 kg m3 in table 2 cases used in the comparison between experimental and numerical results are shown which were taken from the work of valdivia the slug flow frequency shown in table 2 is an average value that was determined during each of the experiments carried out the simulations began with the silicone pipe empty time from which the internal fluid starts to move along it in the simulations a time interval of 120 s from 380 s to 500 s was considered to ensure that the pipe was full of slug flow for the simulations a fixed time step of 0 05 s was also considered one hundred finite elements of equal length were used for the riser model discretization 5 1 1 comparison of the horizontal and vertical displacement at the mid point of the reduced model of riser in the comparisons the dimensionless variables u d i and v d i will be used where u and v represents the horizontal and vertical displacement at the mid point of the reduced model of the riser node 51 respectively and d i is the internal diameter of the reduced model of the riser the power spectrum was also calculated to determine the dominant frequency of the responses figs 9 and 10 show the experimental and numerical results obtained for the variable u d i respectively for case 2 in table 2 fig 11 shows a comparison between the experimental and numerical results obtained for the frequency response values for the horizontal displacement of node 51 from figs 9 and 10 it can be noted that the responses obtained in both cases are very close in the experimental case the response is quite irregular which is because the frequency of the slug flow is variable along the reduced riser model taking values of 3 0 and 3 0 at some points of time for the numerical simulations the maximum oscillation amplitudes have almost the same value which is approximately of 1 75 this is because in the numerical simulations the frequency of the slug flow model was considered constant along the reduced riser model at each instant of time from fig 11 the dominant frequency for the experimental case had a value of 0 47 hz while in the numerical simulations the dominant frequency was 0 39 hz figs 12 and 13 show the experimental and numerical results obtained for the variable v d i respectively for case 2 in table 2 fig 14 shows a comparison between the experimental and numerical results obtained for the frequency response values for the vertical displacement of node 51 from figs 12 and 13 as in the previous case it can be noted that the responses obtained in both cases are very close in the experimental case the response takes values of 4 5 and 4 5 at some points of time for the numerical simulations the maximum oscillation amplitudes have almost the same value which is approximately of 2 8 from fig 14 the fundamental frequency of the experimental response has a value of 0 48 hz while the dominant frequency has a value of 0 65 hz a frequency value of 0 39 hz was obtained for the numerical simulations the numerical results obtained indicates that the forces owing to the gravity acceleration g and the forces owing to the acceleration in the local coordinate system a l in eq 17 they have more influence on the oscillation amplitudes of the horizontal and vertical displacements at the mid point of the reduced riser model on the other hand the forces owing to the angular acceleration and the forces owing to the centripetal acceleration of the internal fluid ω r and ω ω r in eq 17 respectively they have a negligible effect on the displacements at the mid point of the reduced riser model on the other hand the gyroscopic matrix g induced by the force owing to the coriolis acceleration 2 ω v in eq 17 have a negligible effect on the dynamics of the reduced riser model according to the results obtained the elements of the gyroscopic matrix are quite small compared to the elements of the structural damping matrix c therefore this last matrix have a predominant damping effect on the dynamics of the reduced riser model the angular velocity of the elements of the reduced riser model found in the numerical results are small in a range from 0 15 to 0 15 rad s therefore at very high velocities of the internal fluid the gyroscopic matrix would have an impact on the riser dynamics 5 1 2 comparison of the top tension the experimental and numerical results obtained for the top tension will be compared for this purpose the cases 1 and 2 in table 2 will be used figs 15 and 16 show the top tension for the experimental and numerical results respectively for case 1 in table 2 from the comparison it can be noted that the numerical response is quite similar to the experimental one in relation to the oscillation amplitudes a value of 2 5n was obtained for the experimental case while in the numerical case a value of 1 6n was determined differences were found when comparing the average top tension values as can be seen in figs 15 and 16 for the experiment a value of 76 5n was obtained unlike the numerical simulation where a value of 70n was calculated figs 17 and 18 show the top tension for the experimental and numerical results respectively for case 2 in table 2 figs 17 and 18 show good agreement as in the previous case in this comparison in relation to the oscillation amplitudes a value of 4n was obtained for the experimental case while in the numerical case a value of 3n was determined the values obtained for the average top tension also show differences between the numerical and experimental results for which values of 70n and 74n were calculated respectively one of the causes for the difference between the average top tension in both cases is because the mathematical model does not consider the real characteristics of the slug flow such as the liquid film in the region known as taylor s bubble showed in fig 4 the principal reason for the difference in the amplitude as it was mentioned before is the fact of having considered a constant value of slug flow frequency which in reality does not occur another factor that could have influenced on the experimental response is that as can be seen in the experimental facility showed in fig 7 the flow pattern was measured only at the mixer s output reason why is uncertain whether the flow pattern remained unchanged along the catenary on the basis of the results obtained as well as in the comparison carried out in the previous section the forces owing to the acceleration in the local coordinate system a l and the forces owing to the gravity acceleration have a great influence on the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension as well as on the tension along the reduced riser model 5 2 case study in this section the influence of an internal slug flow on the dynamic response of a flexible riser of real dimensions will be studied through a parametric analysis to perform this analysis a fully suspended catenary riser is considered the length of the flexible riser is 450 m and is installed in a deep water field with depth 350 m to establish the initial configuration of the riser which is defined as the static equilibrium configuration in this work a horizontal force of 80 22 kn was applied at the top of the riser to model a flexible riser case 10 for the bending modulus is considered the geometric characteristics and mechanical properties of the flexible riser used in the simulations are listed in table 3 the internal fluid will be represented as a mixture of water and gas the density of water is 998 kg m3 in the case of the gaseous phase air with ideal gas behaviour is assumed which is pressurized between 2000 and 5000 psi and operates at a temperature of 298 k the density of the gaseous phase will be considered to have a value of 200 kg m3 an average production capacity of the riser of 180000 bpd barrels per day is taken into consideration to estimate the values of the liquid and gas mass flows the drag inertia and the added masses coefficients of the sea were considered as 0 7 2 0 and 1 0 respectively sea water density equal to 1025 kg m3 was assumed in this work the current velocity profile was modelled as a simple power law assuming unidirectional current and according to dnv rp c205 rules and standards which is expressed by the following equation 36 v c y v c h y h 1 7 where the variable vc y represents the velocity of the sea current at level y and the variable vc h represents the velocity of the sea current at the sea surface in this work a value of 1 m s for vc h is considered the simulations start with the riser full of air then the internal fluid starts to flow within the riser the parametric analysis is carried out using 200 finite elements of equal length the simulation time was set to 500 s with a fixed time step of 0 05 s 5 2 1 analysis of the top tension for different values of slug flow length several simulations were carried out in each of which were modified the value of the slug flow length as well as the liquid mass flow for the analysis a time interval of 25 s from 475 s to 500 s was considered to ensure that the pipe was full of slug flow the results obtained are shown in figs 19 22 each of figures was elaborated with a different value of liquid mass flow figs 19 22 show us how the changes in the length of the slug flow unit cell which is consider constant along the riser and through the time causes variations in the oscillations amplitudes and the frequency response of the top tension however these variations are larger and have a greater effect on the riser when the value of the liquid mass flow is modified as can be seen when comparing figs 19 22 where variations in the top tension of 25 9 kn 76 4 kn 113 7 kn and 144 2 kn respectively were founded the variations in the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension as well as in the tension along the riser are caused by the mass and velocity variations that the slug flow suffers within the flexible riser the angular velocity of the riser elements found in the numerical simulations oscillates between 0 01 and 0 01 rad s therefore the effect of the coriolis force as mentioned in subsection 5 1 1 is important at high velocities of the internal fluid but since the transport velocity of the internal fluid in production risers is moderate the coriolis effect is of little importance in the dynamics of flexible risers oscillation amplitude variations in the axial tension occur throughout the entire riser as showed in fig 23 in fig 23 the black curve indicates the values of the axial tension throughout the riser in the static equilibrium configuration riser full of air that is when the dynamic analysis is started fig 23 shows the minimum and maximum values between which the axial tension throughout the riser oscillates once it is full of slug flow for different liquid mass flow values it can be observed that the oscillation amplitudes of the axial tension throughout the riser increase as a consequence of the liquid mass flow rise these effects are more pronounced at both ends of the riser 5 2 2 analysis of the top tension for different values of gaseous phase density the analysis of the influence of the gaseous phase density on the top tension of a flexible riser is performed because as the internal fluid oil and its derivatives is being extracted is very likely that the pressure inside the well decreases several simulations were carried out in each of which were modified the value of the gaseous phase density as well as the liquid mass flow for the analysis a time interval of 25 s from 475 s to 500 s was considered to ensure that the pipe was full of slug flow the results obtained are shown in figs 24 27 each of figures was elaborated with a different value of liquid mass flow for each simulation case a slug length value of 10 5 m was considered figs 24 27 shows that by increasing the value of the gaseous phase density of the internal fluid the average top tension increase which is because the weight of the internal fluid throughout the entire length of riser was increased too the increase in the gaseous phase density also produces a reduction in the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension it is clear that as the difference between the density values of the liquid and the gaseous phase decreases the oscillations amplitudes of the top tension also decreases as mentioned above by increasing the liquid mass flow the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension increase too which added to a low density of the gaseous phase produce high oscillation amplitudes of the top tension this case is represented by the green curve in fig 27 where a liquid mass flow equal to 400 kg s and a gaseous phase density equal to 100 kg m3 are considered 5 2 3 analysis of the horizontal and vertical displacement at the midpoint of riser for different values of liquid mass flow simulations were carried out in each of which were modified the value of the liquid mass flow the results obtained are shown in fig 28 and 29 each of figures was elaborated considering a constant slug flow length of 10 5 m the dynamic analysis of flexible risers consists of two parts the initial part covers the startup of the process that ends when the riser is completely filled with slug flow and the second part covers the remaining simulation period in fig 28 and 29 the dotted lines indicate the end of the startup of the simulation it can be noted that the maximum value of the horizontal and vertical displacement at the midpoint of riser for each of simulations occurs during the startup of the simulations once the riser is completely filled of slug flow the horizontal and vertical displacements at the midpoint tend to the same value for all liquid mass flow values as a result of the drag force effect that the seawater exerts on the riser also it can be observed that the horizontal and vertical displacements at the end of simulations are small relative to the equilibrium position this because the value of the elasticity modulus now the results obtained for a different value of elasticity modulus are shown figs 30 and 31 shows the horizontal and vertical displacement respectively when we work with an elasticity modulus equal to e 2 06 10 9 n m 2 from figs 30 and 31 the dynamic response of horizontal and vertical displacement at the midpoint of riser is similar to those shown in figs 28 and 29 it can be noted that for a lesser value of elasticity modulus the displacements at the end of the simulations are greater relative to the equilibrium position 5 2 4 analysis of the top tension for different current velocity profiles simulations were carried out in each of which were modified the value of velocity at the sea surface and the value of the liquid mass flow each of figures was elaborated considering the current velocity profile described by eq 36 with a given velocity vc at the sea surface and 0 m s at the sea floor for each simulation case a slug length value of 10 5 m was considered the results obtained are shown in figs 32 35 from figs 32 35 it can be observed the effect produced by a current velocity profile modelled as a simple power law on the top tension of a flexible catenary riser with regard to the results an increase in the average top tension is obtained as a result of the increase in the velocity vc this effect is more pronounced when the value of vc is higher it can be observed from figs 32 35 as the value of vc increases for a constant value of the liquid mass flow the top tension amplitudes decreases for example for a liquid mass flow of 300 kg s values for the top tension amplitudes of 37 35 kn 35 70 kn 30 75 kn and 22 15 kn were obtained for values of vc of 0 m s 1 m s 2 m s and 3 m s respectively 5 2 5 analysis of the bending moment at the point of maximum curvature of riser for different values of liquid mass flow an analysis of the bending moment acting at the point of maximum curvature of the riser will be carried out simulations were carried out in each of which were modified the value of the liquid mass flow the results obtained are shown in fig 36 and 37 each of figures was elaborated considering a constant slug flow length of 10 5 m the dotted lines indicate the end of the startup of the simulation from fig 36 it can be noted that as the liquid mass flow inside the riser increases the maximum value of the bending moment at the point of maximum curvature decreases the maximum values of the bending moment at the point of maximum curvature occurs during the startup of the simulation once the riser is completely filled with slug flow the bending moment tend to the same value for all liquid mass flow values also fig 37 shows that the oscillation amplitudes of the bending moment have the same value for all liquid mass flow values 5 2 6 comments in relation to the numerical simulations for simulations was used a computer with a processor intel core i7 2 90 ghz and 8 00 gb ram the total simulation time was set at 500 s with a fixed time step of 0 05 s for the simulations 200 finite elements of equal length were considered the average processing time for each simulation was 30 min the convergence in the numerical solution for each simulation has being achieved between the 3rd and 5th iteration for all simulations carried out in some cases reaching the 6th iteration 6 conclusions a computational code was developed to calculate the dynamic response of flexible catenary risers with an internal slug flow a two dimensional parametric analysis was conducted in this work the corotational approach was used because it allows us to separate rigid body motions from strain motion easily the riser element was submitted to large displacements and small deformations the code developed in this work was used to simulate the dynamical behaviour of a reduced model of riser which was tested in laboratory by valdivia 2008 the numerical results show good coherence in comparison with the experimental results obtained by valdivia 2008 therefore the code implemented in this work is qualified to be used in the development of low cost computational tools to conduct parametric studies about the dynamic of flexible risers with an internal slug flow the main conclusions of this work are shown below 1 the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension are generated by the dynamic nature of the slug flow in accordance with the results obtained an increase in the liquid mass flow results in an increase in the oscillation amplitude of the top tension this increase in the amplitude is even higher when the system riser operates with low values of the gaseous phase density 2 the gyroscopic matrix g induced by the coriolis force have a negligible effect on riser dynamics this is due to the velocities values considered for the internal fluid in the numerical simulations for the case study of a real production riser section 5 2 velocity values in accordance with reality were used between 0 and 10 m s 3 during the startup of the simulations by increasing the liquid mass flow a decrease in the maximum value of the bending moment at the point of maximum curvature of riser is caused after the startup the liquid mass flow has not a significant influence in the bending moment as showed in fig 37 4 the effects of a current velocity profile modelled as a power law on the top tension of a flexible catenary riser was studied the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension in accordance with figs 32 35 decreased with increasing the value of the velocity at the sea surface vc 5 the mathematical model of variable density of the slug flow used in this work is a good approximation to carry out numerical studies of the dynamic of risers 6 1 limitations of this study the principal limitation of this study is the slug flow modelling which is made from a simple model that considers the slug flow as a single phase fluid of variable density furthermore in the simulations it was consider that the frequency of the slug flow was constant through the time which it is not as the frequency of the slug flow depends on the other factors such as the superficial velocities of both phases as well as the inclination of the riser among the other parameters to achieve results in line with the reality several improvements shall be made in the mathematical model of the slug flow another of the limitations of this study is that the three dimensional effect of the slug flow on the dynamic behaviour of flexible risers was not considered currently it is hard to find studies about three dimensional catenary risers with an internal slug flow among the few references that carry out studies about three dimensional risers with an internal flow we find the work done by chatjigeorgiu 2010 in which the author studies the effect of a single phase internal fluid on the vibrations of a riser despite working with a single phase internal fluid the author makes several considerations to carry out numerical simulations in which did not consider the internal fluid as being rotational which is the main feature of the three dimensional fluids 6 2 suggestions for future works new research papers can be elaborated on the basis of this paper for this it is suggested the use of a mathematical model that represents what happens with the slug flow inside a flexible catenary riser in a more realistic manner slug tracking models exist and there is also hybrid models slug tracking integrated to a slug capturing model which have been used in slanted straight tubes but not yet used in production risers another suggestion is to conduct a three dimensional parametric analysis of the influence of an internal slug flow on the dynamic response of flexible risers to perform this analysis the corotational approach can be used and the two dimensional formulation for beams must be expanded for the three dimensional case also a numerical model to represent the slug flow in three dimensions must be developed acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the

22977,this paper presents a two dimensional parametric analysis of the influence of an internal slug flow on the structural dynamic response of flexible risers the parametric analysis allow us to study the behaviour of the parameters involved in the dynamic response of flexible risers with an internal slug flow such as displacements top tension and bending moment when any of the parameters characterizing the slug flow is modified to accomplish this goal a computational tool is developed the spatial discretization of the riser is performed using beam finite elements and the corotational approach is used for the two dimensional formulation of the beam element the beam elements have a linear elastic behaviour and they are submitted to large displacements although with small deformations the incremental iterative newton raphson scheme for follower loads is used to solve the equilibrium equations in dynamic analysis time domain numerical integration is performed using the constant average acceleration method the slug flow is viewed as a single phase fluid with variable density which is modelled by a periodic function the numerical results show good coherence when compared to the experimental ones qualifying the computational tool to conduct parametric studies about dynamic of flexible marine risers with an internal slug flow keywords structural dynamic response large displacements corotational formulation slug flow 1 introduction in oil and gas exploration and production operations in deep and ultra deep water flexible risers are widely used to connect a subsea pipeline to a deep water floating or fixed oil production platform because their high resistance to external and internal pressures when exposed at great depths flexible risers have become the primary candidates to be used with floating production platforms in future ultra deep water operations of the oil and gas industry the internal fluid moving inside the riser is a mixture of oil gas and water and it is exposed to different conditions of pressure and temperature these characteristics make the modelling of the internal fluid a highly complex task in this work the slug flow is considered as the pattern of the internal fluid the dynamic response of risers with an internal slug flow is a topic that has been little studied by riser mechanic researchers in the last decades mainly because of the challenge of mathematically modelling the internal slug flow the work carried out by patel and seyed 1989 is among the few references found about this topic in their work to represent the slug flow the authors proposed a simplified one dimensional model based on the sinusoidal behaviour of the internal fluid density along the riser the authors performed experiments using a reduced riser model in which the internal fluid was composed of a mixture of water and air the authors conclude that the effects of the dynamic slug flows can cause large fluctuating tensions on the riser wu and lou 1991 developed a mathematical model to study the effects of an internal fluid and bending rigidity of the pipe on the dynamic behaviour of flexible risers the authors concluded that bending rigidity had a great influence on the dynamic response of riser when the internal fluid flows at high velocities chucheepsakul et al 2003 developed mathematical formulations for the treatment of large strains in extensible flexible marine risers transporting fluid in this work is introduced the apparent tension concept utilized in the present work which was proposed to represent the effect of the external and internal pressures on the axial force acting on the riser monprapussorn et al 2007 studied the influence of the internal pulsatile flow on the dynamic response of flexible risers by means of a parametric analysis the authors concluded that the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid velocity amplifies significantly the top tension and the displacements in the upper region of the riser valdivia 2008 conducted experiments to determine the influence of an internal two phase flow composed of water and air on the dynamic response of a silicone pipe reduced riser model also the author obtained numerical results for the top tension and for the vertical displacement at the mid point of the silicone pipe using the slug flow model proposed by patel and seyed 1989 on the basis of the experimental results the author concluded that the high oscillation amplitudes of the top tension and displacements of the pipe are due to the fact that the response frequencies of the pipe are close to the natural frequencies of the same one polio and mossa pollio and mossa 2008 based on the slug flow model proposed by patel and seyed 1989 made comparisons between two simplified models of slug flow the first model considers a constant slug wavelength along the riser and the other model considers the slug flow wavelength as a function of the riser inclination that is to say with variable slug wavelength along the riser yamamoto 2011 studied experimentally the effect of an internal fluid on the dynamic behaviour of vertical pipes in the results the author observed that the natural frequency of the pipes has the tendency to decrease when the flow rates increases ortega 2015 studied numerically the influence of an internal slug flow on the dynamic response of flexible risers using a computational tool consisting of one program for prediction of slug flow development using a lagrangian tracking model and another program for calculation of the dynamic response of flexible risers the author concluded that the centripetal force and the effective weight variations caused by the slug flow produce fluctuations of the effective top tension the corotational formulation of beam elements with elastic deformations has proven to be efficient for the study of slender structures with large displacements crisfield 1991 and yaw 2009 one of the great advantages of the corotational approach is that allows to separate the rigid body motion from the deformational motion of the structural element in this work the corotational approach has also been used to describe the kinematics of a riser element the present work carries out a two dimensional parametric analysis focusing on the influence of an internal slug flow on the dynamic response of flexible risers the works of patel and seyed 1989 valdivia 2008 and polio and mossa pollio and mossa 2008 calculate the forces caused by the internal fluid on a flexible riser from the application of the linear momentum equation for a finite control volume that encloses an element of riser in this work we calculate the forces caused by the internal fluid using the absolute acceleration of the fluid particles taking into account the relative motion between internal fluid and riser 2 two dimensional formulation for beams for the two dimensional formulation of beams the corotational approach formulated by yaw 2009 has been used the beam element is considered as a structure that performs two types of movement translation and rotation after that it suffers deformations caused by its internal forces consider a typical beam element in its initial and current configurations as shown in fig 1 from fig 1 the beam element in its initial configuration is defined by the global coordinates x 1 y 1 for node 1 and x 2 y 2 for node 2 in its current configuration the node number 1 of the beam element is defined by x 1 u 1 y 1 v 1 and θ 1 and the node number 2 is defined by x 2 u 2 y 2 v 2 and θ 2 where u 1 and v 1 are the horizontal and vertical displacement of node 1 respectively u 2 and v 2 are the horizontal and vertical displacement of node 2 and θ 1 and θ 2 are the rotation angles of the nodes number 1 and 2 respectively which are measured starting from its initial position two coordinates systems are used in the corotational approach the global coordinate system x y and the local corotating coordinate system t n where the direction of t is given by the straight line between the nodal points 1 and 2 in the current configuration from fig 1 the global displacement vector u and the local displacement vector u l are defined as the following 1 u u 1 v 1 θ 1 u 2 v 2 θ 2 t 2 u l u θ 1 l θ 2 l t where u is the local axial displacement of the beam element θ 1 l and θ 2 l are the local rotations of nodes 1 and 2 respectively the components of u l are calculated according to 3 u l l 0 4 θ 1 l θ 1 β β 0 5 θ 2 l θ 2 β β 0 from eqs 3 5 l 0 and l are the measures of the distance between the nodes 1 and 2 in the initial and the current configuration of the beam element respectively and β 0 and β are the measures of the inclination of the local coordinates system in its initial and current configuration respectively with regards to the global coordinates system 2 1 calculus of the tangent stiffness matrix of a beam element the tangent stiffness matrix k t for a beam element is calculated in accordance with the expression proposed by crisfield 1991 which was also used by yaw 2009 6 k t b t c l b n l z z t m 1 m 2 l 2 r z t z r t where n is the axial force which is considered constant along the beam element and the local end moments m 1 and m 2 acting on the nodal points 1 and 2 respectively b c l z and r are defined by 7 b

cos β sin β 0 t where a is the cross sectional area of the beam element and r is the radius of gyration which is defined as r i a the local displacements for a point of the beam element the local transverse displacement and the local rotations are approximated using the conventional cubic polynomial being the local transverse displacements zero at the two ends see crisfield 1991 3 acting loads on flexible risers the acting loads on an element of riser are shown in fig 2 a p e is the external pressure due to the seawater and p i is the internal pressure due to the internal fluid t w is the true wall tension v is the shear force and m is the bending moment f fn and f ft are the acting forces due to the internal fluid in the normal and tangential direction to the riser element axis respectively f m is the force due to the current the force caused by the current is calculated using the morison equation for which the normal component approach is used the normal component approach considers that the normal forces to the scr element are the predominant ones whereas the tangential forces are not taken into account w r is the own weight of the riser fig 2 b shows an equivalent forces system where t a is the apparent tension acting on the riser and w a is the apparent weight of the riser the procedure to obtain the equivalent forces system has been performed by chucheepsakul et al 2003 in subsections 3 1 to 3 4 the forces acting on an element of riser will be explained and subsection 3 5 deals with the procedure to obtain the external force vector applied on the structural nodes of the riser 3 1 apparent tension in a production riser fluids act internally and externally generating hydrostatic static and dynamic pressures in this work the concept of apparent tension is used to represent the combined effect of the external and internal pressures and the true wall tension acting on an element of riser the apparent tension t a and the true wall tension t w are related by means of the following equation see ref chucheepsakul et al 2003 11 t a t a t ˆ t w 2 ν p e a e p i a i t ˆ where ν is the poisson s coefficient while a e and a i are the external and internal area of the transversal section of the riser respectively if the internal fluid is flowing with a velocity v the following relationship is obtained 12 t a t a t ˆ t w 2 ν p e a e p i a i ρ f v 2 a i t ˆ where ρ f is the density of the internal fluid the apparent tension affects the stiffness matrix of each element of riser in this work to determine the stiffness matrix for each element of riser calculated using equation 6 the axial force n is substituted by t a then the true wall tension t w is calculated from eq 12 3 2 apparent weight the concept of apparent weight is used to represent the combined effect of the weight of the riser and the buoyancy forces owing to the external and internal fluids acting on the riser see ref sparks 1984 the apparent weight is a distributed force per unit of length in the vertical direction considering a differential element of length ds the apparent weight of the riser element w a ds can be calculated by adding the archimedian upthrust owing to the seawater ρ w a e g d s and the weight of the contained fluid ρ f a e g d s to the true weight of the pipe w r ds then the following relationship is obtained 13 w a w r ρ f a i g ρ w a e g where w a and w r are the apparent weight and the true weight of the riser per unit of length respectively ρ f is the density of the internal fluid and ρ w is the density of the seawater 3 3 loads due to the internal fluid consider a fluid finite system moving with a local velocity v and acceleration a the newton s second law establishes that 14 d f r a d m where f r is the resultant force which acts on the fluid finite system and dm is a differential element of the fluid mass this force is applied by the riser element on the internal fluid the force applied by the internal fluid on the riser element has the same value but opposite direction and therefore the force due to the internal fluid can be calculated as 15 d f f a d m where f f is the force vector owing to the dynamics of the internal fluid from eq 15 and using d m ρ f a i d s the force owing to the internal fluid per unit of length of riser f f can be calculated as 16 f f ρ f a i a the acceleration of a fluid particle moving inside the riser is calculated using the expression given by shames 2003 17 a a l r 2 ω v ω r ω ω r where a is the acceleration in the global system of coordinates x y z and a l is the acceleration in the local coordinate system t n b on the right side of eq 17 the third term represents the coriolis acceleration the fourth term represents the acceleration caused by the angular acceleration of the local system t n b and the fifth term represents the centripetal acceleration considering a small element of riser as shown in fig 3 this can be approximate as a straight line from fig 3 the point c of the riser element mid point of the element and origin of the local corotating coordinate system t n b is determined by the position vector r and r is the position vector of the particle fluid in the local corotating coordinate system t n b the vectors r and r are expressed by 18 r x c u c i ˆ y c v c j ˆ 19 r s t ˆ the vector v represents the velocity vector of the fluid particle in the local corotating coordinate system t n b which rotates around vector b with an angular velocity ω vectors v and ω are determined by the following expressions 20 v v t ˆ 21 ω β k ˆ and the local acceleration of the fluid particle is given by 22 a l v t ˆ substituting eqs 18 22 in eq 17 and applying the coordinate transformation the expression for the acceleration of the internal fluid is obtained 23 a u c cos β v c sin β v β 2 s t ˆ v c cos β u c sin β 2 β v β s n ˆ where the horizontal and vertical accelerations of the mid point of the riser element u c and v c respectively can be determined by interpolation on the nodal accelerations of the element finally substituting eq 23 into eq 16 the force owing to the internal fluid per unit of length of riser is calculated to calculate the force vector owing to the internal fluid the force per unit of length eq 16 must be concentrated in the nodes of the riser element the velocity of the slug flow v will be defined once the mathematical model is known the model to represent the slug flow will be treated below 3 3 1 mathematical model of slug flow the slug flow is characterized by large bubbles of gas also called taylor bubbles which have a diameter almost equal to the riser diameter separated by slugs of continuous liquid which contain small gas bubbles as showed in fig 4 from fig 4 d e and d i are the external and internal diameter of the riser respectively and l l and l g are the length of the liquid slug and the taylor bubble respectively and l s is the slug wavelength to represent the changes in density of the slug flow owing to the mixture of gas and liquid phases the slug flow was modelled as a single phase fluid having a variable density which varies periodically in relation to the arc length and to the moment in time in this work the mathematical model used is the one proposed by patel and seyed 1989 which is expressed by the following equation 24 ρ f ρ 0 ρ s sin κ s ψ e i ω t where ρ 0 is the average density between the liquid phase density ρ l and the gas phase density ρ g ρ s is the amplitude of density variations κ 2 π l s is the slug wave number s is the arc length of the riser at this point ω is the slug circular frequency and ψ is the angle phase in this work it is considered that the slug flow travels inside the riser with a constant frequency as a consequence the slug lengths are also constant along the riser in a real riser because of the riser inclination the slug flow frequency is variable once the geometry of the slug flow is known we proceed to calculate the velocity of a slug flow particle to do that we start by calculating the total mass flow rate of the slug flow which is calculated for a mixture of water and gas as 25 m q l ρ l q g ρ g where q l and q g are the volumetric flow rate of liquid and gas respectively from the work of santos 2006 and taitel et al 1980 the flow rates of liquid and gas can be expressed as a function of the liquid superficial velocities v sl and the gas superficial velocity v sg as follows 26 q l v s l a i q g v s g a i the local velocity of a fluid particle of slug flow can be calculated using the continuity equation conservation of mass then substituting variables the following equation is obtained 27 v v s l ρ l v s g ρ g ρ f m ρ f a i the total flow rate calculated as the sum of q l and q g can be utilized to obtain a relationship between the slug wavelength l s and the slug circular frequency ω by means of the following equation 28 ω q l q g l s a i 3 4 loads due to current the hydrodynamic loads caused by the current acting on a slanting cylinder can be calculated by using the morison equation in this work as mentioned before the normal component approach will be used which considers that only velocities and accelerations normal to the riser element generate forces from fig 5 v c is the current velocity v t and v n are the current velocity in the tangent and normal direction respectively u n and u n are the components of velocity and acceleration of the riser in the normal direction to the cylinder axis respectively and f m is the morison s force per unit of length the force caused by the current per unit of length is expressed by see patel 2013 29 f m 1 2 c d ρ w d e v n u n v n u n c m ρ w v n π d e 2 4 c a ρ w u n π d e 2 4 where c d c m and c a are the drag inertia and added mass coefficients respectively and ρ w is the density of seawater v n is the component of the acceleration of the seawater in the normal direction to the cylinder axis 3 5 load vector applied to structural nodes of an element of riser in the preceding subsections the external forces acting on an element of riser the apparent weight the force owing to the dynamic of the internal fluid and the force caused by the current were presented in the form of distributed loads however for the purposes of this study these forces must be expressed as concentrated forces in the global coordinate system x y which act on the structural nodes of the riser element this section explains how to convert distributed loads into consistent nodal loads to perform this conversion the distributed loads must be expressed in the local corotating coordinate system t n in the following way f f t t ˆ f n n ˆ where f t is the distributed force in the tangential direction and f n is the distributed force in the normal direction the external force vector r in the local corotating coordinate system is calculated by 30 r l 1 l 2 n t f t f n d s where n is the matrix that contains the shape functions of the riser element and have the following form 31 n n 1 0 0 n 2 0 0 0 n 3 n 4 0 n 5 n 6 from eq 31 n 1 and n 2 are the lagrangian linear shape functions while n 3 n 4 n 5 and n 6 are the lagrange cubic shape functions after obtaining the external force vector in the local corotating coordinate system the external force vector r in global coordinates can be obtained from the following rotation 32 r t r where t is the rotation matrix that transforms a vector from local system to global system and r is the external load vector in the global system the rotation matrix t is expressed by 33 t cos β sin β 0 0 0 0 sin β cos β 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 cos β sin β 0 0 0 0 sin β cos β 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 equilibrium equations and numerical methods the dynamic response of flexible risers the objective of this paper is calculated from its static equilibrium configuration see fig 6 in this section the equilibrium equations for the dynamic analysis are presented as well as the numerical method for its solution from fig 6 h is the sea depth and d is the horizontal displacement of the floating platform in relation to the axis y the coordinates x and y represent the position of a point p of the riser in the static equilibrium configuration p represents the point p in the dynamic configuration at a certain time t and u and v are the horizontal and vertical displacements of the point p respectively in order to determine the dynamic response of flexible risers the equilibrium equation and the numerical methods for their solution are presented below 4 1 dynamic analysis the dynamic response of a flexible riser at a given time t is obtained from the solution of the following dynamic equilibrium equation 34 m t u t c t u t q t u t p t u t u t t associated with the initial conditions at time t 0 35 u t 0 u 0 0 a n d u t 0 u 0 0 where m is the global mass matrix that is the sum of the global matrix of mass structure the global matrix of added mass of the surrounding water and the global matrix of mass due to internal slug flow c is the global damping matrix that is the sum of the struct5u7yural damping matrix which is estimated using the rayleigh damping appendix a and the gyroscopic matrix which is induced by the coriolis force that the internal fluid exerts on the riser q is the global vector of internal nodal forces owing to node displacements p is the global external force vector applied at the nodes of structure u u and u are the global vectors of nodal displacement velocity and acceleration respectively the constant average acceleration method is used to calculate the dynamic response of the riser see ref chopra 2012 5 results and analysis the results obtained using the computational code developed in this work will be compared with the experimental results obtained by valdivia 2008 the objective is to show that the computational code produces numerical results that are consistent with the experimental ones 5 1 comparison between experimental and numerical results the experiment consisted in making the water and air go through a reduced riser model fig 7 shows the test facility components the reduced model of the riser consisted of a silicone pipe of 28 7 m beginning as a horizontal line of 10 7 m and ending at the touch down point tdp which coincides with node number 1 then a pipe in catenary of 18 m in length follows it as presented in fig 8 the geometric characteristics and mechanical properties of the reduced model of the riser are listed in table 1 the experiments conducted were carried out in the air and thus the current forces were not considered in the calculations the considered liquid was water with a density of 998 kg m3 and the gas considered was air at atmospheric pressure with a density of 1 21 kg m3 in table 2 cases used in the comparison between experimental and numerical results are shown which were taken from the work of valdivia the slug flow frequency shown in table 2 is an average value that was determined during each of the experiments carried out the simulations began with the silicone pipe empty time from which the internal fluid starts to move along it in the simulations a time interval of 120 s from 380 s to 500 s was considered to ensure that the pipe was full of slug flow for the simulations a fixed time step of 0 05 s was also considered one hundred finite elements of equal length were used for the riser model discretization 5 1 1 comparison of the horizontal and vertical displacement at the mid point of the reduced model of riser in the comparisons the dimensionless variables u d i and v d i will be used where u and v represents the horizontal and vertical displacement at the mid point of the reduced model of the riser node 51 respectively and d i is the internal diameter of the reduced model of the riser the power spectrum was also calculated to determine the dominant frequency of the responses figs 9 and 10 show the experimental and numerical results obtained for the variable u d i respectively for case 2 in table 2 fig 11 shows a comparison between the experimental and numerical results obtained for the frequency response values for the horizontal displacement of node 51 from figs 9 and 10 it can be noted that the responses obtained in both cases are very close in the experimental case the response is quite irregular which is because the frequency of the slug flow is variable along the reduced riser model taking values of 3 0 and 3 0 at some points of time for the numerical simulations the maximum oscillation amplitudes have almost the same value which is approximately of 1 75 this is because in the numerical simulations the frequency of the slug flow model was considered constant along the reduced riser model at each instant of time from fig 11 the dominant frequency for the experimental case had a value of 0 47 hz while in the numerical simulations the dominant frequency was 0 39 hz figs 12 and 13 show the experimental and numerical results obtained for the variable v d i respectively for case 2 in table 2 fig 14 shows a comparison between the experimental and numerical results obtained for the frequency response values for the vertical displacement of node 51 from figs 12 and 13 as in the previous case it can be noted that the responses obtained in both cases are very close in the experimental case the response takes values of 4 5 and 4 5 at some points of time for the numerical simulations the maximum oscillation amplitudes have almost the same value which is approximately of 2 8 from fig 14 the fundamental frequency of the experimental response has a value of 0 48 hz while the dominant frequency has a value of 0 65 hz a frequency value of 0 39 hz was obtained for the numerical simulations the numerical results obtained indicates that the forces owing to the gravity acceleration g and the forces owing to the acceleration in the local coordinate system a l in eq 17 they have more influence on the oscillation amplitudes of the horizontal and vertical displacements at the mid point of the reduced riser model on the other hand the forces owing to the angular acceleration and the forces owing to the centripetal acceleration of the internal fluid ω r and ω ω r in eq 17 respectively they have a negligible effect on the displacements at the mid point of the reduced riser model on the other hand the gyroscopic matrix g induced by the force owing to the coriolis acceleration 2 ω v in eq 17 have a negligible effect on the dynamics of the reduced riser model according to the results obtained the elements of the gyroscopic matrix are quite small compared to the elements of the structural damping matrix c therefore this last matrix have a predominant damping effect on the dynamics of the reduced riser model the angular velocity of the elements of the reduced riser model found in the numerical results are small in a range from 0 15 to 0 15 rad s therefore at very high velocities of the internal fluid the gyroscopic matrix would have an impact on the riser dynamics 5 1 2 comparison of the top tension the experimental and numerical results obtained for the top tension will be compared for this purpose the cases 1 and 2 in table 2 will be used figs 15 and 16 show the top tension for the experimental and numerical results respectively for case 1 in table 2 from the comparison it can be noted that the numerical response is quite similar to the experimental one in relation to the oscillation amplitudes a value of 2 5n was obtained for the experimental case while in the numerical case a value of 1 6n was determined differences were found when comparing the average top tension values as can be seen in figs 15 and 16 for the experiment a value of 76 5n was obtained unlike the numerical simulation where a value of 70n was calculated figs 17 and 18 show the top tension for the experimental and numerical results respectively for case 2 in table 2 figs 17 and 18 show good agreement as in the previous case in this comparison in relation to the oscillation amplitudes a value of 4n was obtained for the experimental case while in the numerical case a value of 3n was determined the values obtained for the average top tension also show differences between the numerical and experimental results for which values of 70n and 74n were calculated respectively one of the causes for the difference between the average top tension in both cases is because the mathematical model does not consider the real characteristics of the slug flow such as the liquid film in the region known as taylor s bubble showed in fig 4 the principal reason for the difference in the amplitude as it was mentioned before is the fact of having considered a constant value of slug flow frequency which in reality does not occur another factor that could have influenced on the experimental response is that as can be seen in the experimental facility showed in fig 7 the flow pattern was measured only at the mixer s output reason why is uncertain whether the flow pattern remained unchanged along the catenary on the basis of the results obtained as well as in the comparison carried out in the previous section the forces owing to the acceleration in the local coordinate system a l and the forces owing to the gravity acceleration have a great influence on the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension as well as on the tension along the reduced riser model 5 2 case study in this section the influence of an internal slug flow on the dynamic response of a flexible riser of real dimensions will be studied through a parametric analysis to perform this analysis a fully suspended catenary riser is considered the length of the flexible riser is 450 m and is installed in a deep water field with depth 350 m to establish the initial configuration of the riser which is defined as the static equilibrium configuration in this work a horizontal force of 80 22 kn was applied at the top of the riser to model a flexible riser case 10 for the bending modulus is considered the geometric characteristics and mechanical properties of the flexible riser used in the simulations are listed in table 3 the internal fluid will be represented as a mixture of water and gas the density of water is 998 kg m3 in the case of the gaseous phase air with ideal gas behaviour is assumed which is pressurized between 2000 and 5000 psi and operates at a temperature of 298 k the density of the gaseous phase will be considered to have a value of 200 kg m3 an average production capacity of the riser of 180000 bpd barrels per day is taken into consideration to estimate the values of the liquid and gas mass flows the drag inertia and the added masses coefficients of the sea were considered as 0 7 2 0 and 1 0 respectively sea water density equal to 1025 kg m3 was assumed in this work the current velocity profile was modelled as a simple power law assuming unidirectional current and according to dnv rp c205 rules and standards which is expressed by the following equation 36 v c y v c h y h 1 7 where the variable vc y represents the velocity of the sea current at level y and the variable vc h represents the velocity of the sea current at the sea surface in this work a value of 1 m s for vc h is considered the simulations start with the riser full of air then the internal fluid starts to flow within the riser the parametric analysis is carried out using 200 finite elements of equal length the simulation time was set to 500 s with a fixed time step of 0 05 s 5 2 1 analysis of the top tension for different values of slug flow length several simulations were carried out in each of which were modified the value of the slug flow length as well as the liquid mass flow for the analysis a time interval of 25 s from 475 s to 500 s was considered to ensure that the pipe was full of slug flow the results obtained are shown in figs 19 22 each of figures was elaborated with a different value of liquid mass flow figs 19 22 show us how the changes in the length of the slug flow unit cell which is consider constant along the riser and through the time causes variations in the oscillations amplitudes and the frequency response of the top tension however these variations are larger and have a greater effect on the riser when the value of the liquid mass flow is modified as can be seen when comparing figs 19 22 where variations in the top tension of 25 9 kn 76 4 kn 113 7 kn and 144 2 kn respectively were founded the variations in the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension as well as in the tension along the riser are caused by the mass and velocity variations that the slug flow suffers within the flexible riser the angular velocity of the riser elements found in the numerical simulations oscillates between 0 01 and 0 01 rad s therefore the effect of the coriolis force as mentioned in subsection 5 1 1 is important at high velocities of the internal fluid but since the transport velocity of the internal fluid in production risers is moderate the coriolis effect is of little importance in the dynamics of flexible risers oscillation amplitude variations in the axial tension occur throughout the entire riser as showed in fig 23 in fig 23 the black curve indicates the values of the axial tension throughout the riser in the static equilibrium configuration riser full of air that is when the dynamic analysis is started fig 23 shows the minimum and maximum values between which the axial tension throughout the riser oscillates once it is full of slug flow for different liquid mass flow values it can be observed that the oscillation amplitudes of the axial tension throughout the riser increase as a consequence of the liquid mass flow rise these effects are more pronounced at both ends of the riser 5 2 2 analysis of the top tension for different values of gaseous phase density the analysis of the influence of the gaseous phase density on the top tension of a flexible riser is performed because as the internal fluid oil and its derivatives is being extracted is very likely that the pressure inside the well decreases several simulations were carried out in each of which were modified the value of the gaseous phase density as well as the liquid mass flow for the analysis a time interval of 25 s from 475 s to 500 s was considered to ensure that the pipe was full of slug flow the results obtained are shown in figs 24 27 each of figures was elaborated with a different value of liquid mass flow for each simulation case a slug length value of 10 5 m was considered figs 24 27 shows that by increasing the value of the gaseous phase density of the internal fluid the average top tension increase which is because the weight of the internal fluid throughout the entire length of riser was increased too the increase in the gaseous phase density also produces a reduction in the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension it is clear that as the difference between the density values of the liquid and the gaseous phase decreases the oscillations amplitudes of the top tension also decreases as mentioned above by increasing the liquid mass flow the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension increase too which added to a low density of the gaseous phase produce high oscillation amplitudes of the top tension this case is represented by the green curve in fig 27 where a liquid mass flow equal to 400 kg s and a gaseous phase density equal to 100 kg m3 are considered 5 2 3 analysis of the horizontal and vertical displacement at the midpoint of riser for different values of liquid mass flow simulations were carried out in each of which were modified the value of the liquid mass flow the results obtained are shown in fig 28 and 29 each of figures was elaborated considering a constant slug flow length of 10 5 m the dynamic analysis of flexible risers consists of two parts the initial part covers the startup of the process that ends when the riser is completely filled with slug flow and the second part covers the remaining simulation period in fig 28 and 29 the dotted lines indicate the end of the startup of the simulation it can be noted that the maximum value of the horizontal and vertical displacement at the midpoint of riser for each of simulations occurs during the startup of the simulations once the riser is completely filled of slug flow the horizontal and vertical displacements at the midpoint tend to the same value for all liquid mass flow values as a result of the drag force effect that the seawater exerts on the riser also it can be observed that the horizontal and vertical displacements at the end of simulations are small relative to the equilibrium position this because the value of the elasticity modulus now the results obtained for a different value of elasticity modulus are shown figs 30 and 31 shows the horizontal and vertical displacement respectively when we work with an elasticity modulus equal to e 2 06 10 9 n m 2 from figs 30 and 31 the dynamic response of horizontal and vertical displacement at the midpoint of riser is similar to those shown in figs 28 and 29 it can be noted that for a lesser value of elasticity modulus the displacements at the end of the simulations are greater relative to the equilibrium position 5 2 4 analysis of the top tension for different current velocity profiles simulations were carried out in each of which were modified the value of velocity at the sea surface and the value of the liquid mass flow each of figures was elaborated considering the current velocity profile described by eq 36 with a given velocity vc at the sea surface and 0 m s at the sea floor for each simulation case a slug length value of 10 5 m was considered the results obtained are shown in figs 32 35 from figs 32 35 it can be observed the effect produced by a current velocity profile modelled as a simple power law on the top tension of a flexible catenary riser with regard to the results an increase in the average top tension is obtained as a result of the increase in the velocity vc this effect is more pronounced when the value of vc is higher it can be observed from figs 32 35 as the value of vc increases for a constant value of the liquid mass flow the top tension amplitudes decreases for example for a liquid mass flow of 300 kg s values for the top tension amplitudes of 37 35 kn 35 70 kn 30 75 kn and 22 15 kn were obtained for values of vc of 0 m s 1 m s 2 m s and 3 m s respectively 5 2 5 analysis of the bending moment at the point of maximum curvature of riser for different values of liquid mass flow an analysis of the bending moment acting at the point of maximum curvature of the riser will be carried out simulations were carried out in each of which were modified the value of the liquid mass flow the results obtained are shown in fig 36 and 37 each of figures was elaborated considering a constant slug flow length of 10 5 m the dotted lines indicate the end of the startup of the simulation from fig 36 it can be noted that as the liquid mass flow inside the riser increases the maximum value of the bending moment at the point of maximum curvature decreases the maximum values of the bending moment at the point of maximum curvature occurs during the startup of the simulation once the riser is completely filled with slug flow the bending moment tend to the same value for all liquid mass flow values also fig 37 shows that the oscillation amplitudes of the bending moment have the same value for all liquid mass flow values 5 2 6 comments in relation to the numerical simulations for simulations was used a computer with a processor intel core i7 2 90 ghz and 8 00 gb ram the total simulation time was set at 500 s with a fixed time step of 0 05 s for the simulations 200 finite elements of equal length were considered the average processing time for each simulation was 30 min the convergence in the numerical solution for each simulation has being achieved between the 3rd and 5th iteration for all simulations carried out in some cases reaching the 6th iteration 6 conclusions a computational code was developed to calculate the dynamic response of flexible catenary risers with an internal slug flow a two dimensional parametric analysis was conducted in this work the corotational approach was used because it allows us to separate rigid body motions from strain motion easily the riser element was submitted to large displacements and small deformations the code developed in this work was used to simulate the dynamical behaviour of a reduced model of riser which was tested in laboratory by valdivia 2008 the numerical results show good coherence in comparison with the experimental results obtained by valdivia 2008 therefore the code implemented in this work is qualified to be used in the development of low cost computational tools to conduct parametric studies about the dynamic of flexible risers with an internal slug flow the main conclusions of this work are shown below 1 the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension are generated by the dynamic nature of the slug flow in accordance with the results obtained an increase in the liquid mass flow results in an increase in the oscillation amplitude of the top tension this increase in the amplitude is even higher when the system riser operates with low values of the gaseous phase density 2 the gyroscopic matrix g induced by the coriolis force have a negligible effect on riser dynamics this is due to the velocities values considered for the internal fluid in the numerical simulations for the case study of a real production riser section 5 2 velocity values in accordance with reality were used between 0 and 10 m s 3 during the startup of the simulations by increasing the liquid mass flow a decrease in the maximum value of the bending moment at the point of maximum curvature of riser is caused after the startup the liquid mass flow has not a significant influence in the bending moment as showed in fig 37 4 the effects of a current velocity profile modelled as a power law on the top tension of a flexible catenary riser was studied the oscillation amplitudes of the top tension in accordance with figs 32 35 decreased with increasing the value of the velocity at the sea surface vc 5 the mathematical model of variable density of the slug flow used in this work is a good approximation to carry out numerical studies of the dynamic of risers 6 1 limitations of this study the principal limitation of this study is the slug flow modelling which is made from a simple model that considers the slug flow as a single phase fluid of variable density furthermore in the simulations it was consider that the frequency of the slug flow was constant through the time which it is not as the frequency of the slug flow depends on the other factors such as the superficial velocities of both phases as well as the inclination of the riser among the other parameters to achieve results in line with the reality several improvements shall be made in the mathematical model of the slug flow another of the limitations of this study is that the three dimensional effect of the slug flow on the dynamic behaviour of flexible risers was not considered currently it is hard to find studies about three dimensional catenary risers with an internal slug flow among the few references that carry out studies about three dimensional risers with an internal flow we find the work done by chatjigeorgiu 2010 in which the author studies the effect of a single phase internal fluid on the vibrations of a riser despite working with a single phase internal fluid the author makes several considerations to carry out numerical simulations in which did not consider the internal fluid as being rotational which is the main feature of the three dimensional fluids 6 2 suggestions for future works new research papers can be elaborated on the basis of this paper for this it is suggested the use of a mathematical model that represents what happens with the slug flow inside a flexible catenary riser in a more realistic manner slug tracking models exist and there is also hybrid models slug tracking integrated to a slug capturing model which have been used in slanted straight tubes but not yet used in production risers another suggestion is to conduct a three dimensional parametric analysis of the influence of an internal slug flow on the dynamic response of flexible risers to perform this analysis the corotational approach can be used and the two dimensional formulation for beams must be expanded for the three dimensional case also a numerical model to represent the slug flow in three dimensions must be developed acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support by the

22978,this article aims at proposing an efficient frequency domain approach for fully coupled analysis of offshore structures in this method the nonlinear dynamic items in governing equations including velocity squared drag force and geometric deformation of mooring lines are extracted and linearized up to second order perturbation transformations in frequency domain moreover the line seabed interaction term is considered effectively and the bottom lying portion is modeled with a reduced spring coefficient related to the floater motion results by matching the continuity requirement at boundary points the first and second order differential governing equations are solved numerically by goodman lance approach to avoid prohibitive calculations so that estimations of frequency response functions can be more computationally intensive using time domain td simulation as a benchmark one case of a moored semi submersible is employed to investigate the performance of this frequency domain fd approach the numerical results show that i the predicted vessel motion and mooring tension responses match well with that of the fully coupled time domain analysis software simo and riflex and ii the bottom line seabed interaction can be modeled accurately which provide almost identical response estimates as those of the time domain method especially for the mooring line segment near touch down point tdp keywords frequency domain coupled dynamic analysis mooring line floating structure linearization 1 introduction floating structures such as semi submersible fpso and spar are popular for oil gas exploitations in deepwater and it is common that mooring systems are needed to keep these unshielded structures on station under the harsh marine environment for such moored floating system the integrity of mooring lines is of high importance as the failure possibility may increase due to the combinations of environmental loads motions of platforms impact with seabed abrasion and sea water corrosion thus in the design stage of mooring system one of the key points is to accurately predict the dynamic response of mooring lines as well as the closely related motions of the connected floating structures ma et al 2013 in deepwater with the increase of section and length dimension of mooring lines the dynamic interaction between platform and its connected mooring lines is more pronounced and a coupled analysis is required to accurately obtain the individual dynamic responses of all subsystems it is important to include the dynamic interactions between floating structure and mooring lines into calculation ormberg and larsen 1998 compared the coupled analysis and the quasi static decoupled approach applied to deepwater floating system and the results indicated that the latter may produce unreliable results when extreme environmental condition is considered in addition the need for coupled analysis has also been recognized by ma et al 2000 lee and flory 1999 lee and devlin 2000 and kim et al 2001a b in this case coupled dynamic analysis tools are increasingly recommended for deepwater applications in current offshore industry in coupled analysis the floating structure and mooring lines are integrated into a single model and dynamically analyzed so that all the interactions among platforms and its mooring system can be fully captured all the dynamic effects of mooring lines such as damping wave and current loads stiffness and inertia can be included furthermore low and langley 2008a b identified that the coupling of the system responses at different time scales which pertain to the mean offset first order wave frequency wf response and the low frequency lf resonant response due to second order wave effects should also been involved in procedure along this trend the fully coupled time domain dynamic analysis is directly held to be the only means of incorporating all types of coupling effects to obtain a reliable design this method can yield dynamic equilibrium between the force acting on the floater and mooring lines at each time step and automatically deal with the entire nonlinear contribution as well without any artificial participation both academic and industrial research on this topic have developed such numerical analysis tools e g chakrabarti et al 1996 ran 2000 garrett 2005 tahar and kim 2008 yang and kim 2010 yang et al 2012 and there are also several commercial packages such as dnv s software deepc bv s hydrostar and so on that employ this approach to complex practical problems nevertheless in practice the computational effort that demanded such a calculation procedure is usually far too excessive for routine design purposes due to the enough long time coupled dynamic simulation that is required to be executed for all the deign sea states and usually repeated several times in order to formulate reliable statistical representation of random dynamic response in this case notwithstanding the advances in computer hardware a number of alternative efficient methods have been proposed with certain approximations and assumptions regarding the treatment of the coupling effects computational efficiency can be improved effectively for instance ormberg and larson 1998 developed an improved method i e state of the art method soa to consider an uncoupled time domain analysis of the platform modeling the lines as quasi static springs and enhance this model by applying the dynamic influence of the lines as an equivalent linear damping coefficient however garrett et al 2002 concluded that soa method would produce larger motion as much as 30 for the example of west africa fpso even though the input was the best possible furthermore in the view of low and langley 2008b given that both the wf response and environmental parameters have influence on the mooring dynamics there are several limitations inherent in such methods in this way they are commonly much more suitable for the initial design process alternatively in the search for another efficient method the frequency domain approach is also appealing however the coupling effect in the frequency domain has so far received little attention compared with the time domain methods the reason may be the demands to make approximations regarding the treatment of nonlinearities which are difficult to assess on accuracy more recently lang et al 2005 low and langley 2006 le cunff et al 2008 and low and grime 2011 have developed the corresponding coupled analysis tools in frequency domain the key part of these developments followed a similar way stochastic dynamic analysis about the mean static position was carried out using the normal mode approach and statistical linearization method rodenbusch et al 1986 roberts and spanos 2003 and the stiffness matrices of mooring lines were generally assumed to be unchanged during the analysis comparison of fd results with td results for typical cases of deepwater systems as reported in these literature appears very promising paving the way for the confident use of fd models even though the considerable loss of accuracy especially for the lf response in specific cases low and langley 2008a pointed out that to get the reliable performance of the frequency domain approach two factors should be included in appropriate way one is the dynamic impact of geometric nonlinearity of mooring lines though it is relative minor for the deepwater condition and the other is the ideal linearization scheme for the lf drag forces over the entire spectrum moreover vendhan 2014 indicated that the additional soil line interaction at the touch down area should be represented which can be important for fatigue and extreme response cases it was also demonstrated analytically that in the weak nonlinear deepwater condition frequency domain method does indeed provide an optimal estimate with computational efficiency if all the above aspects were handled as a result there is a need to develop a further efficient and accurate coupled analysis method in frequency domain to cater to all these complex scenarios at this juncture a novel coupled frequency domain method is developed for the dynamic analysis of moored offshore structures in this method a moment equilibrium model is introduced to generate the governing equations for mooring line dynamic analysis and then based on perturbation method the nonlinear dynamic items including velocity squared drag force and geometric deformation of mooring lines are extracted and linearized up to second order transformations in frequency domain in addition the line seabed interaction is also considered effectively and simplified as a reduction coefficient based on the top end motion results with the dynamic coupling between mooring system and floater achieved by matching the continuity requirement at both up and bottom boundary points the dynamic equations are solved simultaneously by goodman lance approach to avoid redundant calculation in such two point boundary problem therefore this method is expected to be more efficient in view of the computational demands to validate its favorable performance the case study of a moored semi submersible is applied in particular using time domain simulation by software simo and riflex as a benchmark all the calculation schemes for this frequency domain method are founded on an identical framework thereby facilitating a consistent comparison in the numerical case 2 preliminaries in this section background materials which are fundamental to this article are reviewed briefly it is also intends to acquaint the reader with the notation convention to be used 2 1 dynamic model of mooring line as shown in fig 1 a right handed cartesian coordinate system o x y z is defined for the single line computation the instantaneous configuration of mooring line is expressed in terms of node location vector r s r x r y r z t which is the function of unstretched arc length parameter s along the mooring line length from anchor point s 0 f is the distributed force per unit length acting on mooring line segments the internal state of stress at a point on the mooring line is described fully by the resultant force and the resultant moment acting at the centerline of the mooring section on the basis of conservation of linear momentum and moment of momentum we can derive equations as chen 2002 1 t s f 0 2 t r s 0 the derivation assumes that the mooring material is homogeneous in cross section but not necessarily along the length with negligible moments and shear forces the only internal force is the tension t tangential to the local cable direction as shown in eq 2 from physical aspect in addition r must satisfy a stretching constrain equation as gobat 2000 3 t ˆ h t r s t ˆ s h n r ε 1 e a t t in which a superposed dot denotes differentiation with respect to time t t ˆ r s t r s t x t y t z is the unit tangential vector along mooring line length ε is tension strain h t and h n are the transformation matrix for tangential and normal component separately and their expressions are derived by projection principle as 4 h

mooring line the distributed hydrodynamic acting on mooring line segments including inertia part f m and drag part f d for these slender structures ratio of wavelength to diameter λ d 5 it is a good approximation for computing hydrodynamic forces by morison equation and expressed separately for directions normal and tangential to the line as wang 2014 6 f m f m t f m n ρ w a c m t h t u ρ w a c m t h t r ρ w a c m n h n u ρ w a c m n h n r 7 f d f d t f d n 1 2 ρ w c d t d h t u h t u 1 2 ρ w c d n d h n u h n u in which the superscript t and n indicate the tangential and normal component across the mooring line segment ρ w is the mass density of the sea water a is the outer cross section area u is the wave particle velocity u v u r and v is the current velocity c m and c m indicate the inertia and added mass coefficients separately c d is the drag coefficient d is the nominal diameter of the mooring line it is noted that the drag force is nonlinear and should be linearized in some fashion for the dynamic analysis in frequency domain which based on the linear system for the dynamic analysis under random sea condition the velocity squared term appearing in the drag force is treated using the well established technique of statistical linearization wu and tung 1975 roberts and spanos 2003 naess and moan 2012 as 8 u u c w f where w u r c is the equivalent linear coefficient and f is a constant force vector based on minimization of the expected square error of eq 8 with respect to c and f the derivation of the linearization results can be found in the investigation by langley 1984 and rodenbusch et al 1986 in this way the linearized drag force can be expressed as 9 f d 1 2 ρ w c d t d t l c l t t l t h t u r b l t 1 2 ρ w c d n d t l c l n t l t h n u r c b l n where the subscript l indicates that the tangential and normal components are transformed in the local orthogonal coordinate which has been further investigated by langley 1984 t l is the transformation matrix b is a function of constant force vector f it is noted that the derivation is according to gaussian assumption of variables nevertheless according to the research of gao and moan 2007 and li et al 2016 it is notable that dynamic responses of mooring line are in principle non gaussian in this case an improvement can be developed based on the further investigation on the more appropriate probability functions 3 model description of mooring line in frequency domain modeling of the floating system comprises two distinct components i e the floating structure and its mooring lines in this section detailed features of the modeling of mooring line structure are firstly presented 3 1 perturbation expansion the differential eqs 1 3 is satisfied along the whole mooring line following the asymptotic expansion procedure we will assume that the solution will depend on the presumed small quantity which is usually defined as the wave steepness under small amplitude wave state therefore all quantities including the distributed force location vector sectional tension and tension strain can be decomposed into a power series which is presumed to be decrease dramatically in higher order 10 r r 0 r 1 r 2 t t 0 t 1 t 2 f f 0 f 1 f 2 ε ε 0 ε 1 ε 2 h t h 0 t h 1 t h 2 t h n h 0 n h 1 n h 2 n where the subscripts 0 1 and 2 indicate separately the mean static value the first and second order variables of small perturbation parameter by substituting these expansions we can get the first and second order expressions of eq 2 as 11 r 1 s t 1 r 0 s t 0 t 0 2 a 1 t 0 and 12 r 2 s t 2 r 0 s t 1 r 1 s t 0 t 0 2 a 2 t 0 by using the taylor series expansions around the mean static equilibrium value we can also obtain the first and second order expressions of eq 3 13 k 0 x r 1 x k 0 y r 1 y k 0 z r 1 z i 0 x r 1 x s i 0 y r 1 y s i 0 z r 1 z s 1 e a t 0 x t 0 t 1 x t 0 y t 0 t 1 y t 0 z t 0 t 1 z and 14 k 0 x r 2 x k 0 y r 2 y k 0 z r 2 z i 0 x r 2 x s i 0 y r 2 y s i 0 z r 2 z s q r 1 1 e a t 0 x t 0 t 2 x t 0 y t 0 t 2 y t 0 z t 0 t 2 z q t 1 where the superscript x y and z indicate vector elements in x y and z direction separately the other given variables are listed in table 1 in addition the external forces except net weight f g applied on mooring line can be also separated into several terms according to their orders in perturbation series apart from the explicit expressions of hydrodynamic force investigated in advance there are structural inertia force f a and line seabed interaction force f b needing to be calculated the expression of the former is simple and it can be directly accounted for by the inclusion of mass matrix in the equation of motion as 15 f a m r in which m represents the mass per unit length as for mooring line segments resting on the seabed the upward contact forces are included while friction effect is considered to be less significant for the system analyzed and it is neglected in this paper a modified linear spring model with a gradual transition is proposed and the seabed contact force on mooring line is of the form chen 2002 16 f b 0 0 f b z in which the vertical component is 17 f b z k d b 2 r z r b t m z d b 2 r z r b t m z 0 0 d b 2 r z r b t m z 0 where k is suitably chosen constant as the stiffness of seabed d b is the outer diameter of the mooring line and it can be adopted as d b 3 35 d studless line or d b 3 6 d studlink line r b t m z is the coordinate of the seabed in z axis during the dynamic analysis the touch down point tdp of mooring line changes as the floater moves to remove that nonlinear effect in this model the dynamic tdp is replaced by a pinned transition which can be determined by the top end motions of fairlead in this case since the extreme motions of floating system are commonly under a preponderance of lf effects as shown in fig 2 mean offset and extreme motions of the floater horizontal degree of freedom i e surge sway and yaw are selected and 8 combinations of these values as list in table 2 are built in order to cover the possible range of fairlead positions then for each of the 8 positions the configuration of mooring line is computed by catenary equation to determine the limitations of such transitive touch down segment the extreme motion can be predicted as davenport 1964 18 x e 2 ln υ t h 0 5772 2 ln υ t h σ x in which t h is the simulation duration σ x is the standard deviation of motion response υ stands for the mean zero upcrossing rate and can be computed from the zeroth and second order moment of response spectral density λ 0 and λ 2 as 19 υ 1 2 π λ 2 λ 0 meanwhile a reduction coefficient λ is calculated to represent the mean level of seabed contact force for the transitive touch down segment as shown in fig 3 s 1 s 2 is the transitive boundary limitations along line length direction and the mean vertical positions of these two end points are defined as 2 σ z 1 and 2 σ z 2 separately where σ z is the standard deviation of r z in this way the mean vertical positions alone the transitive segment can be obtained based on appropriate interpolation scheme it is assumed that the mean seabed contact force is proportional to vertical motion range b beneath the mudline as demonstrated in fig 3 as a result the reduction coefficient is defined as 20 λ 1 0 s s 1 b 2 2 σ z s 1 s s 2 0 s 2 s l in that way all the distributed forces mentioned above are summarized and expanded into perturbation series their mean first and second order terms are listed in table 3 3 2 differential governing equations one can convert eq 11 into linear expression as 21 r 1 s n t t 1 a 1 t 0 where 22 n t n t 11 n t 12 n t 13 n t 21 n t 22 n t 23 n t 31 n t 32 n t 33 t 0 y r 0 y t 0 z r 0 z t 0 y r 0 x t 0 z r 0 x t 0 x r 0 y t 0 x r 0 x t 0 z r 0 z t 0 z r 0 y t 0 x r 0 z t 0 y r 0 z t 0 x r 0 x t 0 y r 0 y in the frequency domain analysis with eq 13 substituted into eq 21 can be converted to the formation as 23 k r r 1 k t t 1 k a a 1 0 in which a superposed wavy line denotes the complex amplitude in frequency ω e g r r ⅇ i ω t and k r k r 1 k r 2 k r 3 t k 0 k t k t 1 k t 2 k t 3 t n t i 0 1 e a t 0 t 0 k a i 0 t 0 then the coefficient a 1 is solved as 24 a 1 1 k a k r r 1 k t t 1 1 k a k r 1 k r 2 k r 3 k t 1 k t 2 k t 3 r 1 t 1 substituting eq 24 into eq 21 one can obtain the differential equation as 25 r 1 s a 11 a 12 r 1 t 1 where the matrix coefficients are listed in table 4 in addition substituting the expressions of distributed external force into eq 2 one can derive another part of differential equation for the line tension as 26 t 1 s f m 1 f d 1 f b 1 1 ε 0 f d 0 f b 0 ε 1 f a 1 all the mean and first order components of the distributed forces are investigated as aforementioned and 27 ε 0 t 0 e a 28 ε 1 1 e a t 0 t 1 t 0 then the conversion of eq 26 can be expressed as 29 t 1 s a 21 a 22 r 1 t 1 b 2 in which the matrix coefficients are also listed in table 4 with the combination of eq 25 and eq 29 a set of first order linear differential equation is established as 30 r 1 s t 1 s a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 r 1 t 1 b 1 b 2 a r 1 t 1 b as for the second order differential governing equation of mooring line one can derive its expression in the similar way as 31 r 2 s t 2 s a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 r 2 t 2 d 1 d 2 a r 2 t 2 d in which the only difference is nonhomogeneous term d and it contains two components one is combined by the first order solution of eq 30 and the other is induced by the second order wave particle velocity its elements are shown in table 4 4 motion equations of floating structure large volume floaters are generally modeled as rigid bodies with six degrees of freedom at the center of gravity cg with x ξ x ξ y ξ z θ x θ y θ z t representing surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw in that order the translational degrees of freedom are measured in the same coordinate system as the mooring lines hence the motion equations can be expressed as 32 m x c x kx f w f m f c f w d in which m c and k are respectively the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the floating structure it is notable that the wave radiation forces which can be calculated by the three dimensional potential theory are included in the above system parameters matrices i e the added mass and potential damping coefficient matrices and the external current force f c and wind force f w d are considered as constant in this work the wave exciting forces f w acting on the floater are solved from a diffraction analysis pinkster 1979 kim and yue 1991 the vector of first order wave forces is expressed as 33 f w 1 ω h w 1 ω η ω where η is the wave elevation and h w 1 is the vector of first order force transfer functions in addition the floater is also subjected to second order forces for a compliant structure only the difference frequencies are of importance so that the sum frequencies can often be neglected the difference frequency forces are defined as 34 f w 2 ω i ω j h w 2 ω i ω j η ω i η ω j where h w 2 denotes the vector of second order force transfer functions the mooring force f m can be expressed as a linear combination of mooring line tension vectors as 35 f m n 1 n t f n n 1 n t f n l n n 1 n 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 l n z l n y l n z 0 l n x l n y l n x 0 t f n n 1 n n l n t f n where l n is the direction vector from cg to the fairlead of the nth mooring line and t f n is the mooring line top end tension vector which is equal to t n l n as defined in section 2 in this way the first and second order motion equations in frequency domain can be derived from eq 32 as 36 ω 2 m i ω c k x 1 f w 1 n 1 n n l n t f 1 n 37 ω i ω j 2 m i ω i ω j c k x 2 f w 2 n 1 n n l n t f 2 n and the first and second order solution of floater motion are 38 x 1 ω 2 m i ω c k 1 f w 1 n 1 n n l n t f 1 n 39 x 2 ω i ω j 2 m i ω i ω j c k 1 f w 2 n 1 n n l n t f 2 n 5 fully coupled analysis of the moored floating system 5 1 boundary condition after the motion equations of floating system are solved the coupling effect between the response of moored floating structure and mooring system is achieved by matching them at the boundary point to fulfill the continuity requirement as connected to the fairlead of floating structure the top end boundary condition of the ith mooring line can be derived as 40 r f i ξ h l l i where ξ ξ x ξ y ξ z t are the translational displacements of floater and 41 h l cos θ z cos θ x sin θ z cos θ y sin θ y sin θ z cos θ x cos θ z sin θ y sin θ x cos θ z cos θ x sin θ z sin θ y sin θ x cos θ y sin θ x sin θ z sin θ x cos θ z sin θ y cos θ x cos θ z sin θ x sin θ z sin θ y cos θ x cos θ y cos θ x in which θ θ x θ y θ z t are the euler angles in the roll pitch yaw sequence substituting the solution of floater motions as shown in eqs 38 and 39 the first and second order top end boundary condition of the ith mooring line can be respectively expanded from eq 40 as 42 r f 1 i n 1 n r t n i t f 1 n f t 1 i 43 r f 2 i n 1 n r t n i t f 2 n f t 2 i p θ i in which 44 r t n

specified as a fixed point with expression as 48 r 1 0 r 2 0 0 5 2 numerical implementation thus to solve these so called two points boundary problems with the ordinary differential governing equations as eqs 30 and 31 and the boundary conditions as eqs 42 43 and 48 a direct way is reducing this problem to a set of linear algebraic equations by finite difference method and the matrix expression can be written as 49 ax b in which the unknown vector x r n o d e 1 t n o d e 1 r n o d e 2 t n o d e 2 r n o d e m t n o d e m contains the tension and global location of all mooring line nodes if the node number of mooring system is m the procedure results in 6m independent equations and coefficients as a result the calculation demands for direct solving eq 49 will be too excessive when the node number is considerable in the search for a more efficient approach goodman lance method is introduced to transform this issue to a one point boundary problem keller 1976 in this way eq 49 is divided into several 6 equation sets so that it is expected to be more suitable for the case of large mooring line node number with less computer time than others before the solving process it is convenient to replace the solution by the sum of two individual parts of the homogenous and non homogenous equations and in this way the two kinds of equations can be solved respectively for instance the first order differential equation of mooring line can be divided into the following parts as a one is a homogenous equation 50 r 1 1 s t 1 1 s a r 1 1 t 1 1 with non homogenous boundary condition 51 r 1 1 0 0 r 1 1 l r f 1 b the other is a non homogenous equation 52 r 1 2 s t 1 2 s a r 1 2 t 1 2 b with the homogenous condition 53 r 1 2 0 0 r 1 l 0 the former can be transformed by goodman lance method to another linear expression as 54 x s a t x in which the variable vector x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 t is arbitrary and it satisfies the following identical relation along mooring line length direction 55 x t r 1 1 t 1 1 y s x 1 r 1 x 1 x 2 r 1 y 1 x 3 r 1 z 1 x 4 t 1 x 1 x 5 t 1 y 1 x 6 t 1 z 1 c o n s t according to the identical relation in the end points as expressed by eq 55 i e y 0 y l a set of independent equations are obtained by integrating eq 50 along the lagrangian coordinate s for each mooring line and then the solution of these simultaneous equations can be acquired by means of numerical methods e g gauss elimination as for the latter part huang et al 2001 proposed a method in which the green s identity function is used to represent the influence of nonhomogeneous term in eq 52 this method is adopted here and based on the principle of linear superposition the solution of the latter part can be obtained as 56 r 1 2 s t 1 2 s i 1 6 0 l b i s g r i s s g t i s s d s in which g s s is the matrix of green s function and it is taken as the response in coordinate s corresponding to dirac δ excitation acting on s location the value of g s s is equal to the solution of eqs 50 and 51 with different continuity condition as following 57 r 1 2 s s t 1 2 s s r 1 2 s s t 1 2 s s δ i where the increment vector δ i δ i j only has non zero element δ i j 1 when i j and goodman lance method is used to solve this equation in the similar way when the first and second order responses of mooring line are calculated it is necessary to work directly through spectral analysis to update the variance σ 2 as introduced in the stochastic linearization of drag force for a set of discrete frequencies with equal interval as δ ω if the first and second order response values at each specified frequency set under unit amplitude incident wave are computed as r 1 n δ ω and r 2 n δ ω k δ ω the expectation of one sided spectrum can be derived as langley 1987 58 s r r n δ ω s r r 1 n δ ω s r r 2 n δ ω s r r 3 n δ ω where 59 s r r 1 n δ ω r 1 n δ ω r 1 n δ ω s w n δ ω 60 s r r 2 n δ ω k 0 n r 2 n δ ω k δ ω k δ ω r 2 n δ ω k δ ω k δ ω s w n δ ω k δ ω s w k δ ω δ ω 61 s r r 3 n δ ω 2 k 0 n r 2 n δ ω k δ ω k δ ω r 2 n δ ω k δ ω k δ ω s w n δ ω k δ ω s w k δ ω δ ω in which asterisk indicates the complex conjugate operation s w is incident wave spectrum then the variances of mooring line node displacement and velocity are obtained by a discretized approach 62 σ r 2 n 1 n s r r n δ ω δ ω 63 σ r 2 n 1 n n δ ω 2 s r r n δ ω δ ω in addition the transformation matrix t l of coordinates for linearization of velocity squared drag force in eq 9 should also be calculated based on principle component analysis low and langley 2006 as both σ 2 and t l depend on the system responses the frequency domain analysis is clearly iterative fig 4 shows the simple flow chart for this frequency domain coupled dynamic analysis in the numerical simulation the static analysis is firstly performed using newton s method to determine the mean offset of the moored floating system and it is also noted that the initial guess of variance matrix used for iterative calculation can be taken from the results of traditional two step quasi static method proposed by correa et al 2002 6 numerical simulation to further illustrate the proposed methodology a comprehensive coupled numerical simulation of a semi submersible platform and its mooring system is carried out the accuracy of the calculation results is benchmarked against the results from time domain analysis software simo and riflex 6 1 numerical model and environmental conditions the same coupled model including the semisubmersible and mooring system as described in reference li et al 2016 have been used for the case study its horizontal projection is shown in fig 5 the platform with the mooring system is symmetrical about both the x and y axis the main dimensions of the semi submersible are as follows the total length is 114 07 m the breadth is 79 m the draft is 18 m and the displacement is 52275 t the catenary mooring system consists of 12 lines with 3 lines in each corner at departure angles of 40 45 and 50 respecting to the longitudinal x axis there are three components including two segments of studlink chains at fairlead and anchor respectively and one segment of spiral strand wire in the middle for each mooring line properties of the mooring lines are demonstrated in table 5 and table 6 shows the mooring system configuration data in operation for the present purpose of illustrating the proposed method wind and current loads which could be considered constant acting on the hull are not included in the simulations for simplicity only the wave induced force is considered during the dynamic analysis the random wave state is described by jonswap spectrum and the environment heading is 90 from x axis in counter clockwise direction positive y axis direction simulation parameters for fully coupled time and frequency domain analysis are given in table 7 the wave spectrum is divided into a number of strips with discrete frequencies as aforementioned it is convenient to use a consistent interval δ ω however in frequency domain it is possible to select a smaller δ ω for the second order analysis to capture the narrow banded response as for the time domain analysis transients with higher frequencies are introduced at the start of the simulation but they are rapidly damped off during this stage it is necessary to reduce the time step slightly to allow the transients to dissipate gradually in addition statistical estimated spectral densities are recovered from the time histories averaged over at least ten runs to facilitate the reliable result 6 2 simulation results and discussion 6 2 1 floater motion response results of the fully coupled time and frequency domain analyses are presented and compared here two specified wave states are selected as the calculated conditions i a mild wave state with significant wave height h s 2 5 m and mean zero cross period t z 7 5 s in which the non linear effects of dynamics are expected to be relatively weak ii the operating wave state with significant wave height h s 6 5 m and mean zero cross period t z 10 5 s which is considered as an important design condition for the drilling platform the spectral densities of sway roll and the top tension of the most loaded line 10 are considered to be of particular interest and are shown in fig 6 the wf range in some spectra has been magnified scaled by a factor for better clarity in addition table 8 gives the standard deviations of the vessel motions and line tensions which are calculated from the spectra and separated into wf and lf components it is noted that there is little difference between the results of wf vessel motions obtained from the time domain and the proposed methods this is consistent with expectation since vessel motions are either hydrostatic stiffness dominated roll or inertia dominated sway and they are not influenced much by the coupling effects from mooring system meanwhile the frequency domain analysis is found to over predict the lf motions except the sway response under wave state with parameters of h s 6 5 m t z 10 5 s but the error is relatively small the discrepancies for sway and roll are 5 86 and 4 96 respectively it can be concluded that such acceptable accuracy of the proposed frequency domain approach mainly stems from two aspects one is that the introduced drag linearization procedure produces good results as verified in the prior research work low and langley 2006 and the other is the appropriate representation of geometric nonlinearity albeit approximately as both the restoring force of the mooring system and line damping are position dependent large changes in line geometry will affect the dynamic responses ultimately in the proposed method these effects are accounted for by the second order expansion about mean offset position though truncation error induced by higher order terms still exists and cumulates in a small deviation of vessel motions as shown in table 9 it can be conjectured that the overall effect is commonly acceptable in order to place the accuracy of the proposed method in perspective more clearly an excerpt of its time history for sway motion converted by inverse fourier transform with the same phase input is displayed in fig 7 together with the coupled time domain results furthermore the calculated solution by frequency domain method proposed by wang 2014 is also presented in which the effects of geometric deformation and second order terms are neglected the average statistical parameters of sway roll and heave for ten realizations are provided in table 9 as expected the proposed frequency domain method demonstrates a favorable performance and the results are in good agreement with time domain fully coupled analysis with relative deviations of the motion amplitudes commonly within the order of 5 by contrast the solution of wang s method which neglects slow drift effects underestimates the extreme motion response substantially this demonstrates that neglecting second order coupling terms cannot be recommended as an accurate modeling strategy at least for such vessel type floaters 6 2 2 mooring line tension for the dynamic top tensions of mooring line the frequency domain analysis underestimates the standard deviation of the wf component by approximately up to 6 25 under the wave condition with parameters as h s 6 5 m t z 10 5 s the time series of the horizontal displacement and tension of mooring line top end for this wave state are presented in fig 8 it appears that such relative difference in prediction of wf dynamic tension is because of the vessel offset dependent line dynamics as aforementioned the nonlinear items are expanded about mean offset position in the frequency domain analysis it is highly demonstrated that the effects of top end displacement of mooring line especially induced by the large lf motions are not captured completely in this case the results should be of limited value for analysis in which the wf tension is dominant e g fatigue assessment although the extreme divergence is still satisfactory within engineering expectations as the results shown in table 8 and fig 8 furthermore this limitation might be mitigated to some extent by performing the wf or first order frequency domain analysis over a range of instantaneous offset positions as recommended by dnv 2001 and the hybrid method proposed by low and langley 2008a there will be a trial in the further research as for the lf component of mooring line top end tension the results appear to be comparatively more ideal within 5 as shown in table 8 one possibility is that for the deepwater floating system investigated in this work the lf top end displacement mostly originates the change in angle of the line at the fairlead rather than elastic deformation together with the action of negligible dynamic effects as a result the lf composition is in fact minimal and substantially insensitive to the change in geometry it also implies that wf component can dominate the overall dynamic tension which is clearly observed in fig 8 b moreover for the chosen cases the tension magnitudes along the mooring line are plotted in fig 9 the additional results of the least loaded line 3 are presented as a comparison and in these figures the amplitude of the dynamic tension is taken to be half the difference between the maximum and minimum values averaged from ten realizations it is found that the accuracy of the frequency domain analysis is evidently consistent with the extent of the nonlinear behavior of top end responses compared to the results of line 10 as shown in fig 9 the disparity drops for almost entire length as the top loading amplitude is reduced in line 3 however on a whole along line 10 the tension predicted by the frequency domain analysis differs from the time domain analysis by a maximum of 7 15 which is still in close agreement 6 2 3 response in touch down zone it is also notable in fig 9 that a reliable capture of the seabed interaction transition zone as indicated in subsection 2 2 3 can be obtained by the proposed frequency domain method in above calculation hyperbolic cosine function hcf is introduced to interpolate the mean position of mooring segment within the transition range to further validate its feasibility a comparative study is carried out with another quadratic interpolate function qf and the calculated standard deviations of mooring tension which are separated into wf and lf components are plotted in fig 10 for several specified points near the transitive touch down zone as another representation the corresponding time series of the mooring segment lying on this transition zone s 635 m along the line from bottom end is shown in fig 11 it is found that hyperbolic function is somewhat more appropriate with consistent to the configuration of mooring line even though it has limited influence on the responses far away 6 2 4 multi state calculation results finally to estimate the dynamic responses under variable wave conditions a set of combinations of significant wave height h s and mean zero cross period t z described by the non zero joint probability of occurrences in a wave scatter diagram of the north atlantic ocean is considered as shadowed zone in table 10 fig 12 qualitatively shows an overall comparison of the response standard derivations by different methods in this graph the abscissa is the value estimated by time domain analysis while the ordinate is provided by the given frequency domain method perfect correspondence is associated to data lying on the tilted straight line while any deviation indicates inaccuracy in the estimation the more detailed analysis results for different sea states of given h s or t z are presented in fig 13 and fig 14 excellent agreement with the results from simulations is observed under almost all the wave states with the discrepancies within 8 23 and 8 74 separately for sway motion and line tension however the results also highlight that the proposed method tends to systematically overestimate the dynamics from simulations especially when the significant wave height increases the reason may be that such severe sea state substantially accounts for the high levels of geometric nonlinearity leading to the breakdown of the assumption of small deflections in the formulation in contrast as shown in fig 13 the influence of wave period is not significant in the variation range with irregular fluctuations for the floating system on one hand the periods of exciting loads are shifted towards resonance with increasing wave period tending to induce larger dynamic responses and on the other hand opposing influence is given rise by the reduced dynamic effects from inertia and damping force from this point it can be conjectured that the overall effect is likely to be uncertain but fortunately the observable change exists in a relatively narrow range and the accuracy seems to be kept acceptable in the view for practice in the calculated cases the proposed frequency domain method requires 54 min of average computational time as compared with 20 h for a fully coupled time domain analysis for the ten runs with the node number of each mooring line set to be 800 it is obvious that the proposed frequency domain method provides significant advantages even though an advanced numerical solver is equipped in software simo and riflex 7 conclusion an efficient frequency domain approach for fully coupled analysis of floating structures is presented in this method a moment equilibrium model is introduced to generate the governing equations for mooring dynamics analysis based on the perturbation method the nonlinear dynamic equations are linearized up to second order transformation in frequency domain the velocity squared term in drag force is treated by the established technique of statistical linearization while geometric nonlinearities of mooring lines are handled with assuming perturbation procedure about the mean position moreover the line seabed interaction is also considered effectively and simplified as a reduction coefficient based on the top end motion results with the dynamic coupling between the mooring system and floater achieved by matching at the boundary point to fulfill the continuity requirement both the first and second order perturbation equations of mooring system and floating structure are established in the calculation and then solved to get the frequency response functions as verification the dynamic responses of a moored semi submersible platform under waves are calculated and compared with the results conducted by time domain analysis software simo and riflex on a whole simulation results indicate that the proposed frequency domain method is apparently accurate within engineering expectations in the present example especially for the floater motion and lf mooring line tension furthermore the line seabed interaction can be appropriately accommodated for mooring segment near tdp as indicated in the comparison results along line length hyperbolic cosine function is introduced in this work to interpolate the mean position of mooring segment within the transition zone and its feasibility has been validated however it is found that for the sea states with higher significant wave height differences of calculated results can become larger due to somewhat breakdown of the assumption of small deflections in the formulation while in contrast the wave period seems to have limited influence on the accuracy of this method and what is more it is shown that large changes in line geometry will affect the responses both in the wf and lf ranges ultimately and the induced larger scale of transitive zone near tdp could also has adverse impact on the application of the proposed method therefore it is essential to investigate the numerical performance of this method under extreme wave conditions and clarify the limited state meanwhile it is also proposed that this limitation might be mitigated to some extent by performing this frequency domain method over a range of instantaneous offset and interpolating to obtain improved results as suggested by low and langley 2008a when the geometric nonlinearity of the mooring lines is important there is a need to take further investigation on this complex scenario acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the financial support by the major program of the national natural

22978,this article aims at proposing an efficient frequency domain approach for fully coupled analysis of offshore structures in this method the nonlinear dynamic items in governing equations including velocity squared drag force and geometric deformation of mooring lines are extracted and linearized up to second order perturbation transformations in frequency domain moreover the line seabed interaction term is considered effectively and the bottom lying portion is modeled with a reduced spring coefficient related to the floater motion results by matching the continuity requirement at boundary points the first and second order differential governing equations are solved numerically by goodman lance approach to avoid prohibitive calculations so that estimations of frequency response functions can be more computationally intensive using time domain td simulation as a benchmark one case of a moored semi submersible is employed to investigate the performance of this frequency domain fd approach the numerical results show that i the predicted vessel motion and mooring tension responses match well with that of the fully coupled time domain analysis software simo and riflex and ii the bottom line seabed interaction can be modeled accurately which provide almost identical response estimates as those of the time domain method especially for the mooring line segment near touch down point tdp keywords frequency domain coupled dynamic analysis mooring line floating structure linearization 1 introduction floating structures such as semi submersible fpso and spar are popular for oil gas exploitations in deepwater and it is common that mooring systems are needed to keep these unshielded structures on station under the harsh marine environment for such moored floating system the integrity of mooring lines is of high importance as the failure possibility may increase due to the combinations of environmental loads motions of platforms impact with seabed abrasion and sea water corrosion thus in the design stage of mooring system one of the key points is to accurately predict the dynamic response of mooring lines as well as the closely related motions of the connected floating structures ma et al 2013 in deepwater with the increase of section and length dimension of mooring lines the dynamic interaction between platform and its connected mooring lines is more pronounced and a coupled analysis is required to accurately obtain the individual dynamic responses of all subsystems it is important to include the dynamic interactions between floating structure and mooring lines into calculation ormberg and larsen 1998 compared the coupled analysis and the quasi static decoupled approach applied to deepwater floating system and the results indicated that the latter may produce unreliable results when extreme environmental condition is considered in addition the need for coupled analysis has also been recognized by ma et al 2000 lee and flory 1999 lee and devlin 2000 and kim et al 2001a b in this case coupled dynamic analysis tools are increasingly recommended for deepwater applications in current offshore industry in coupled analysis the floating structure and mooring lines are integrated into a single model and dynamically analyzed so that all the interactions among platforms and its mooring system can be fully captured all the dynamic effects of mooring lines such as damping wave and current loads stiffness and inertia can be included furthermore low and langley 2008a b identified that the coupling of the system responses at different time scales which pertain to the mean offset first order wave frequency wf response and the low frequency lf resonant response due to second order wave effects should also been involved in procedure along this trend the fully coupled time domain dynamic analysis is directly held to be the only means of incorporating all types of coupling effects to obtain a reliable design this method can yield dynamic equilibrium between the force acting on the floater and mooring lines at each time step and automatically deal with the entire nonlinear contribution as well without any artificial participation both academic and industrial research on this topic have developed such numerical analysis tools e g chakrabarti et al 1996 ran 2000 garrett 2005 tahar and kim 2008 yang and kim 2010 yang et al 2012 and there are also several commercial packages such as dnv s software deepc bv s hydrostar and so on that employ this approach to complex practical problems nevertheless in practice the computational effort that demanded such a calculation procedure is usually far too excessive for routine design purposes due to the enough long time coupled dynamic simulation that is required to be executed for all the deign sea states and usually repeated several times in order to formulate reliable statistical representation of random dynamic response in this case notwithstanding the advances in computer hardware a number of alternative efficient methods have been proposed with certain approximations and assumptions regarding the treatment of the coupling effects computational efficiency can be improved effectively for instance ormberg and larson 1998 developed an improved method i e state of the art method soa to consider an uncoupled time domain analysis of the platform modeling the lines as quasi static springs and enhance this model by applying the dynamic influence of the lines as an equivalent linear damping coefficient however garrett et al 2002 concluded that soa method would produce larger motion as much as 30 for the example of west africa fpso even though the input was the best possible furthermore in the view of low and langley 2008b given that both the wf response and environmental parameters have influence on the mooring dynamics there are several limitations inherent in such methods in this way they are commonly much more suitable for the initial design process alternatively in the search for another efficient method the frequency domain approach is also appealing however the coupling effect in the frequency domain has so far received little attention compared with the time domain methods the reason may be the demands to make approximations regarding the treatment of nonlinearities which are difficult to assess on accuracy more recently lang et al 2005 low and langley 2006 le cunff et al 2008 and low and grime 2011 have developed the corresponding coupled analysis tools in frequency domain the key part of these developments followed a similar way stochastic dynamic analysis about the mean static position was carried out using the normal mode approach and statistical linearization method rodenbusch et al 1986 roberts and spanos 2003 and the stiffness matrices of mooring lines were generally assumed to be unchanged during the analysis comparison of fd results with td results for typical cases of deepwater systems as reported in these literature appears very promising paving the way for the confident use of fd models even though the considerable loss of accuracy especially for the lf response in specific cases low and langley 2008a pointed out that to get the reliable performance of the frequency domain approach two factors should be included in appropriate way one is the dynamic impact of geometric nonlinearity of mooring lines though it is relative minor for the deepwater condition and the other is the ideal linearization scheme for the lf drag forces over the entire spectrum moreover vendhan 2014 indicated that the additional soil line interaction at the touch down area should be represented which can be important for fatigue and extreme response cases it was also demonstrated analytically that in the weak nonlinear deepwater condition frequency domain method does indeed provide an optimal estimate with computational efficiency if all the above aspects were handled as a result there is a need to develop a further efficient and accurate coupled analysis method in frequency domain to cater to all these complex scenarios at this juncture a novel coupled frequency domain method is developed for the dynamic analysis of moored offshore structures in this method a moment equilibrium model is introduced to generate the governing equations for mooring line dynamic analysis and then based on perturbation method the nonlinear dynamic items including velocity squared drag force and geometric deformation of mooring lines are extracted and linearized up to second order transformations in frequency domain in addition the line seabed interaction is also considered effectively and simplified as a reduction coefficient based on the top end motion results with the dynamic coupling between mooring system and floater achieved by matching the continuity requirement at both up and bottom boundary points the dynamic equations are solved simultaneously by goodman lance approach to avoid redundant calculation in such two point boundary problem therefore this method is expected to be more efficient in view of the computational demands to validate its favorable performance the case study of a moored semi submersible is applied in particular using time domain simulation by software simo and riflex as a benchmark all the calculation schemes for this frequency domain method are founded on an identical framework thereby facilitating a consistent comparison in the numerical case 2 preliminaries in this section background materials which are fundamental to this article are reviewed briefly it is also intends to acquaint the reader with the notation convention to be used 2 1 dynamic model of mooring line as shown in fig 1 a right handed cartesian coordinate system o x y z is defined for the single line computation the instantaneous configuration of mooring line is expressed in terms of node location vector r s r x r y r z t which is the function of unstretched arc length parameter s along the mooring line length from anchor point s 0 f is the distributed force per unit length acting on mooring line segments the internal state of stress at a point on the mooring line is described fully by the resultant force and the resultant moment acting at the centerline of the mooring section on the basis of conservation of linear momentum and moment of momentum we can derive equations as chen 2002 1 t s f 0 2 t r s 0 the derivation assumes that the mooring material is homogeneous in cross section but not necessarily along the length with negligible moments and shear forces the only internal force is the tension t tangential to the local cable direction as shown in eq 2 from physical aspect in addition r must satisfy a stretching constrain equation as gobat 2000 3 t ˆ h t r s t ˆ s h n r ε 1 e a t t in which a superposed dot denotes differentiation with respect to time t t ˆ r s t r s t x t y t z is the unit tangential vector along mooring line length ε is tension strain h t and h n are the transformation matrix for tangential and normal component separately and their expressions are derived by projection principle as 4 h t t ˆ t ˆ t x 2 t x t y t x t z t x t y t y 2 t y t z t x t z t y t z t z 2 5 h n i 3 3 t ˆ t ˆ 1 t x 2 t x t y t x t z t x t y 1 t y 2 t y t z t x t z t y t z 1 t z 2 2 2 hydrodynamic force on mooring line the distributed hydrodynamic acting on mooring line segments including inertia part f m and drag part f d for these slender structures ratio of wavelength to diameter λ d 5 it is a good approximation for computing hydrodynamic forces by morison equation and expressed separately for directions normal and tangential to the line as wang 2014 6 f m f m t f m n ρ w a c m t h t u ρ w a c m t h t r ρ w a c m n h n u ρ w a c m n h n r 7 f d f d t f d n 1 2 ρ w c d t d h t u h t u 1 2 ρ w c d n d h n u h n u in which the superscript t and n indicate the tangential and normal component across the mooring line segment ρ w is the mass density of the sea water a is the outer cross section area u is the wave particle velocity u v u r and v is the current velocity c m and c m indicate the inertia and added mass coefficients separately c d is the drag coefficient d is the nominal diameter of the mooring line it is noted that the drag force is nonlinear and should be linearized in some fashion for the dynamic analysis in frequency domain which based on the linear system for the dynamic analysis under random sea condition the velocity squared term appearing in the drag force is treated using the well established technique of statistical linearization wu and tung 1975 roberts and spanos 2003 naess and moan 2012 as 8 u u c w f where w u r c is the equivalent linear coefficient and f is a constant force vector based on minimization of the expected square error of eq 8 with respect to c and f the derivation of the linearization results can be found in the investigation by langley 1984 and rodenbusch et al 1986 in this way the linearized drag force can be expressed as 9 f d 1 2 ρ w c d t d t l c l t t l t h t u r b l t 1 2 ρ w c d n d t l c l n t l t h n u r c b l n where the subscript l indicates that the tangential and normal components are transformed in the local orthogonal coordinate which has been further investigated by langley 1984 t l is the transformation matrix b is a function of constant force vector f it is noted that the derivation is according to gaussian assumption of variables nevertheless according to the research of gao and moan 2007 and li et al 2016 it is notable that dynamic responses of mooring line are in principle non gaussian in this case an improvement can be developed based on the further investigation on the more appropriate probability functions 3 model description of mooring line in frequency domain modeling of the floating system comprises two distinct components i e the floating structure and its mooring lines in this section detailed features of the modeling of mooring line structure are firstly presented 3 1 perturbation expansion the differential eqs 1 3 is satisfied along the whole mooring line following the asymptotic expansion procedure we will assume that the solution will depend on the presumed small quantity which is usually defined as the wave steepness under small amplitude wave state therefore all quantities including the distributed force location vector sectional tension and tension strain can be decomposed into a power series which is presumed to be decrease dramatically in higher order 10 r r 0 r 1 r 2 t t 0 t 1 t 2 f f 0 f 1 f 2 ε ε 0 ε 1 ε 2 h t h 0 t h 1 t h 2 t h n h 0 n h 1 n h 2 n where the subscripts 0 1 and 2 indicate separately the mean static value the first and second order variables of small perturbation parameter by substituting these expansions we can get the first and second order expressions of eq 2 as 11 r 1 s t 1 r 0 s t 0 t 0 2 a 1 t 0 and 12 r 2 s t 2 r 0 s t 1 r 1 s t 0 t 0 2 a 2 t 0 by using the taylor series expansions around the mean static equilibrium value we can also obtain the first and second order expressions of eq 3 13 k 0 x r 1 x k 0 y r 1 y k 0 z r 1 z i 0 x r 1 x s i 0 y r 1 y s i 0 z r 1 z s 1 e a t 0 x t 0 t 1 x t 0 y t 0 t 1 y t 0 z t 0 t 1 z and 14 k 0 x r 2 x k 0 y r 2 y k 0 z r 2 z i 0 x r 2 x s i 0 y r 2 y s i 0 z r 2 z s q r 1 1 e a t 0 x t 0 t 2 x t 0 y t 0 t 2 y t 0 z t 0 t 2 z q t 1 where the superscript x y and z indicate vector elements in x y and z direction separately the other given variables are listed in table 1 in addition the external forces except net weight f g applied on mooring line can be also separated into several terms according to their orders in perturbation series apart from the explicit expressions of hydrodynamic force investigated in advance there are structural inertia force f a and line seabed interaction force f b needing to be calculated the expression of the former is simple and it can be directly accounted for by the inclusion of mass matrix in the equation of motion as 15 f a m r in which m represents the mass per unit length as for mooring line segments resting on the seabed the upward contact forces are included while friction effect is considered to be less significant for the system analyzed and it is neglected in this paper a modified linear spring model with a gradual transition is proposed and the seabed contact force on mooring line is of the form chen 2002 16 f b 0 0 f b z in which the vertical component is 17 f b z k d b 2 r z r b t m z d b 2 r z r b t m z 0 0 d b 2 r z r b t m z 0 where k is suitably chosen constant as the stiffness of seabed d b is the outer diameter of the mooring line and it can be adopted as d b 3 35 d studless line or d b 3 6 d studlink line r b t m z is the coordinate of the seabed in z axis during the dynamic analysis the touch down point tdp of mooring line changes as the floater moves to remove that nonlinear effect in this model the dynamic tdp is replaced by a pinned transition which can be determined by the top end motions of fairlead in this case since the extreme motions of floating system are commonly under a preponderance of lf effects as shown in fig 2 mean offset and extreme motions of the floater horizontal degree of freedom i e surge sway and yaw are selected and 8 combinations of these values as list in table 2 are built in order to cover the possible range of fairlead positions then for each of the 8 positions the configuration of mooring line is computed by catenary equation to determine the limitations of such transitive touch down segment the extreme motion can be predicted as davenport 1964 18 x e 2 ln υ t h 0 5772 2 ln υ t h σ x in which t h is the simulation duration σ x is the standard deviation of motion response υ stands for the mean zero upcrossing rate and can be computed from the zeroth and second order moment of response spectral density λ 0 and λ 2 as 19 υ 1 2 π λ 2 λ 0 meanwhile a reduction coefficient λ is calculated to represent the mean level of seabed contact force for the transitive touch down segment as shown in fig 3 s 1 s 2 is the transitive boundary limitations along line length direction and the mean vertical positions of these two end points are defined as 2 σ z 1 and 2 σ z 2 separately where σ z is the standard deviation of r z in this way the mean vertical positions alone the transitive segment can be obtained based on appropriate interpolation scheme it is assumed that the mean seabed contact force is proportional to vertical motion range b beneath the mudline as demonstrated in fig 3 as a result the reduction coefficient is defined as 20 λ 1 0 s s 1 b 2 2 σ z s 1 s s 2 0 s 2 s l in that way all the distributed forces mentioned above are summarized and expanded into perturbation series their mean first and second order terms are listed in table 3 3 2 differential governing equations one can convert eq 11 into linear expression as 21 r 1 s n t t 1 a 1 t 0 where 22 n t n t 11 n t 12 n t 13 n t 21 n t 22 n t 23 n t 31 n t 32 n t 33 t 0 y r 0 y t 0 z r 0 z t 0 y r 0 x t 0 z r 0 x t 0 x r 0 y t 0 x r 0 x t 0 z r 0 z t 0 z r 0 y t 0 x r 0 z t 0 y r 0 z t 0 x r 0 x t 0 y r 0 y in the frequency domain analysis with eq 13 substituted into eq 21 can be converted to the formation as 23 k r r 1 k t t 1 k a a 1 0 in which a superposed wavy line denotes the complex amplitude in frequency ω e g r r ⅇ i ω t and k r k r 1 k r 2 k r 3 t k 0 k t k t 1 k t 2 k t 3 t n t i 0 1 e a t 0 t 0 k a i 0 t 0 then the coefficient a 1 is solved as 24 a 1 1 k a k r r 1 k t t 1 1 k a k r 1 k r 2 k r 3 k t 1 k t 2 k t 3 r 1 t 1 substituting eq 24 into eq 21 one can obtain the differential equation as 25 r 1 s a 11 a 12 r 1 t 1 where the matrix coefficients are listed in table 4 in addition substituting the expressions of distributed external force into eq 2 one can derive another part of differential equation for the line tension as 26 t 1 s f m 1 f d 1 f b 1 1 ε 0 f d 0 f b 0 ε 1 f a 1 all the mean and first order components of the distributed forces are investigated as aforementioned and 27 ε 0 t 0 e a 28 ε 1 1 e a t 0 t 1 t 0 then the conversion of eq 26 can be expressed as 29 t 1 s a 21 a 22 r 1 t 1 b 2 in which the matrix coefficients are also listed in table 4 with the combination of eq 25 and eq 29 a set of first order linear differential equation is established as 30 r 1 s t 1 s a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 r 1 t 1 b 1 b 2 a r 1 t 1 b as for the second order differential governing equation of mooring line one can derive its expression in the similar way as 31 r 2 s t 2 s a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 r 2 t 2 d 1 d 2 a r 2 t 2 d in which the only difference is nonhomogeneous term d and it contains two components one is combined by the first order solution of eq 30 and the other is induced by the second order wave particle velocity its elements are shown in table 4 4 motion equations of floating structure large volume floaters are generally modeled as rigid bodies with six degrees of freedom at the center of gravity cg with x ξ x ξ y ξ z θ x θ y θ z t representing surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw in that order the translational degrees of freedom are measured in the same coordinate system as the mooring lines hence the motion equations can be expressed as 32 m x c x kx f w f m f c f w d in which m c and k are respectively the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the floating structure it is notable that the wave radiation forces which can be calculated by the three dimensional potential theory are included in the above system parameters matrices i e the added mass and potential damping coefficient matrices and the external current force f c and wind force f w d are considered as constant in this work the wave exciting forces f w acting on the floater are solved from a diffraction analysis pinkster 1979 kim and yue 1991 the vector of first order wave forces is expressed as 33 f w 1 ω h w 1 ω η ω where η is the wave elevation and h w 1 is the vector of first order force transfer functions in addition the floater is also subjected to second order forces for a compliant structure only the difference frequencies are of importance so that the sum frequencies can often be neglected the difference frequency forces are defined as 34 f w 2 ω i ω j h w 2 ω i ω j η ω i η ω j where h w 2 denotes the vector of second order force transfer functions the mooring force f m can be expressed as a linear combination of mooring line tension vectors as 35 f m n 1 n t f n n 1 n t f n l n n 1 n 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 l n z l n y l n z 0 l n x l n y l n x 0 t f n n 1 n n l n t f n where l n is the direction vector from cg to the fairlead of the nth mooring line and t f n is the mooring line top end tension vector which is equal to t n l n as defined in section 2 in this way the first and second order motion equations in frequency domain can be derived from eq 32 as 36 ω 2 m i ω c k x 1 f w 1 n 1 n n l n t f 1 n 37 ω i ω j 2 m i ω i ω j c k x 2 f w 2 n 1 n n l n t f 2 n and the first and second order solution of floater motion are 38 x 1 ω 2 m i ω c k 1 f w 1 n 1 n n l n t f 1 n 39 x 2 ω i ω j 2 m i ω i ω j c k 1 f w 2 n 1 n n l n t f 2 n 5 fully coupled analysis of the moored floating system 5 1 boundary condition after the motion equations of floating system are solved the coupling effect between the response of moored floating structure and mooring system is achieved by matching them at the boundary point to fulfill the continuity requirement as connected to the fairlead of floating structure the top end boundary condition of the ith mooring line can be derived as 40 r f i ξ h l l i where ξ ξ x ξ y ξ z t are the translational displacements of floater and 41 h l cos θ z cos θ x sin θ z cos θ y sin θ y sin θ z cos θ x cos θ z sin θ y sin θ x cos θ z cos θ x sin θ z sin θ y sin θ x cos θ y sin θ x sin θ z sin θ x cos θ z sin θ y cos θ x cos θ z sin θ x sin θ z sin θ y cos θ x cos θ y cos θ x in which θ θ x θ y θ z t are the euler angles in the roll pitch yaw sequence substituting the solution of floater motions as shown in eqs 38 and 39 the first and second order

specified as a fixed point with expression as 48 r 1 0 r 2 0 0 5 2 numerical implementation thus to solve these so called two points boundary problems with the ordinary differential governing equations as eqs 30 and 31 and the boundary conditions as eqs 42 43 and 48 a direct way is reducing this problem to a set of linear algebraic equations by finite difference method and the matrix expression can be written as 49 ax b in which the unknown vector x r n o d e 1 t n o d e 1 r n o d e 2 t n o d e 2 r n o d e m t n o d e m contains the tension and global location of all mooring line nodes if the node number of mooring system is m the procedure results in 6m independent equations and coefficients as a result the calculation demands for direct solving eq 49 will be too excessive when the node number is considerable in the search for a more efficient approach goodman lance method is introduced to transform this issue to a one point boundary problem keller 1976 in this way eq 49 is divided into several 6 equation sets so that it is expected to be more suitable for the case of large mooring line node number with less computer time than others before the solving process it is convenient to replace the solution by the sum of two individual parts of the homogenous and non homogenous equations and in this way the two kinds of equations can be solved respectively for instance the first order differential equation of mooring line can be divided into the following parts as a one is a homogenous equation 50 r 1 1 s t 1 1 s a r 1 1 t 1 1 with non homogenous boundary condition 51 r 1 1 0 0 r 1 1 l r f 1 b the other is a non homogenous equation 52 r 1 2 s t 1 2 s a r 1 2 t 1 2 b with the homogenous condition 53 r 1 2 0 0 r 1 l 0 the former can be transformed by goodman lance method to another linear expression as 54 x s a t x in which the variable vector x x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 t is arbitrary and it satisfies the following identical relation along mooring line length direction 55 x t r 1 1 t 1 1 y s x 1 r 1 x 1 x 2 r 1 y 1 x 3 r 1 z 1 x 4 t 1 x 1 x 5 t 1 y 1 x 6 t 1 z 1 c o n s t according to the identical relation in the end points as expressed by eq 55 i e y 0 y l a set of independent equations are obtained by integrating eq 50 along the lagrangian coordinate s for each mooring line and then the solution of these simultaneous equations can be acquired by means of numerical methods e g gauss elimination as for the latter part huang et al 2001 proposed a method in which the green s identity function is used to represent the influence of nonhomogeneous term in eq 52 this method is adopted here and based on the principle of linear superposition the solution of the latter part can be obtained as 56 r 1 2 s t 1 2 s i 1 6 0 l b i s g r i s s g t i s s d s in which g s s is the matrix of green s function and it is taken as the response in coordinate s corresponding to dirac δ excitation acting on s location the value of g s s is equal to the solution of eqs 50 and 51 with different continuity condition as following 57 r 1 2 s s t 1 2 s s r 1 2 s s t 1 2 s s δ i where the increment vector δ i δ i j only has non zero element δ i j 1 when i j and goodman lance method is used to solve this equation in the similar way when the first and second order responses of mooring line are calculated it is necessary to work directly through spectral analysis to update the variance σ 2 as introduced in the stochastic linearization of drag force for a set of discrete frequencies with equal interval as δ ω if the first and second order response values at each specified frequency set under unit amplitude incident wave are computed as r 1 n δ ω and r 2 n δ ω k δ ω the expectation of one sided spectrum can be derived as langley 1987 58 s r r n δ ω s r r 1 n δ ω s r r 2 n δ ω s r r 3 n δ ω where 59 s r r 1 n δ ω r 1 n δ ω r 1 n δ ω s w n δ ω 60 s r r 2 n δ ω k 0 n r 2 n δ ω k δ ω k δ ω r 2 n δ ω k δ ω k δ ω s w n δ ω k δ ω s w k δ ω

the variances of mooring line node displacement and velocity are obtained by a discretized approach 62 σ r 2 n 1 n s r r n δ ω δ ω 63 σ r 2 n 1 n n δ ω 2 s r r n δ ω δ ω in addition the transformation matrix t l of coordinates for linearization of velocity squared drag force in eq 9 should also be calculated based on principle component analysis low and langley 2006 as both σ 2 and t l depend on the system responses the frequency domain analysis is clearly iterative fig 4 shows the simple flow chart for this frequency domain coupled dynamic analysis in the numerical simulation the static analysis is firstly performed using newton s method to determine the mean offset of the moored floating system and it is also noted that the initial guess of variance matrix used for iterative calculation can be taken from the results of traditional two step quasi static method proposed by correa et al 2002 6 numerical simulation to further illustrate the proposed methodology a comprehensive coupled numerical simulation of a semi submersible platform and its mooring system is carried out the accuracy of the calculation results is benchmarked against the results from time domain analysis software simo and riflex 6 1 numerical model and environmental conditions the same coupled model including the semisubmersible and mooring system as described in reference li et al 2016 have been used for the case study its horizontal projection is shown in fig 5 the platform with the mooring system is symmetrical about both the x and y axis the main dimensions of the semi submersible are as follows the total length is 114 07 m the breadth is 79 m the draft is 18 m and the displacement is 52275 t the catenary mooring system consists of 12 lines with 3 lines in each corner at departure angles of 40 45 and 50 respecting to the longitudinal x axis there are three components including two segments of studlink chains at fairlead and anchor respectively and one segment of spiral strand wire in the middle for each mooring line properties of the mooring lines are demonstrated in table 5 and table 6 shows the mooring system configuration data in operation for the present purpose of illustrating the proposed method wind and current loads which could be considered constant acting on the hull are not included in the simulations for simplicity only the wave induced force is considered during the dynamic analysis the random wave state is described by jonswap spectrum and the environment heading is 90 from x axis in counter clockwise direction positive y axis direction simulation parameters for fully coupled time and frequency domain analysis are given in table 7 the wave spectrum is divided into a number of strips with discrete frequencies as aforementioned it is convenient to use a consistent interval δ ω however in frequency domain it is possible to select a smaller δ ω for the second order analysis to capture the narrow banded response as for the time domain analysis transients with higher frequencies are introduced at the start of the simulation but they are rapidly damped off during this stage it is necessary to reduce the time step slightly to allow the transients to dissipate gradually in addition statistical estimated spectral densities are recovered from the time histories averaged over at least ten runs to facilitate the reliable result 6 2 simulation results and discussion 6 2 1 floater motion response results of the fully coupled time and frequency domain analyses are presented and compared here two specified wave states are selected as the calculated conditions i a mild wave state with significant wave height h s 2 5 m and mean zero cross period t z 7 5 s in which the non linear effects of dynamics are expected to be relatively weak ii the operating wave state with significant wave height h s 6 5 m and mean zero cross period t z 10 5 s which is considered as an important design condition for the drilling platform the spectral densities of sway roll and the top tension of the most loaded line 10 are considered to be of particular interest and are shown in fig 6 the wf range in some spectra has been magnified scaled by a factor for better clarity in addition table 8 gives the standard deviations of the vessel motions and line tensions which are calculated from the spectra and separated into wf and lf components it is noted that there is little difference between the results of wf vessel motions obtained from the time domain and the proposed methods this is consistent with expectation since vessel motions are either hydrostatic stiffness dominated roll or inertia dominated sway and they are not influenced much by the coupling effects from mooring system meanwhile the frequency domain analysis is found to over predict the lf motions except the sway response under wave state with parameters of h s 6 5 m t z 10 5 s but the error is relatively small the discrepancies for sway and roll are 5 86 and 4 96 respectively it can be concluded that such acceptable accuracy of the proposed frequency domain approach mainly stems from two aspects one is that the introduced drag linearization procedure produces good results as verified in the prior research work low and langley 2006 and the other is the appropriate representation of geometric nonlinearity albeit approximately as both the restoring force of the mooring system and line damping are position dependent large changes in line geometry will affect the dynamic responses ultimately in the proposed method these effects are accounted for by the second order expansion about mean offset position though truncation error induced by higher order terms still exists and cumulates in a small deviation of vessel motions as shown in table 9 it can be conjectured that the overall effect is commonly acceptable in order to place the accuracy of the proposed method in perspective more clearly an excerpt of its time history for sway motion converted by inverse fourier transform with the same phase input is displayed in fig 7 together with the coupled time domain results furthermore the calculated solution by frequency domain method proposed by wang 2014 is also presented in which the effects of geometric deformation and second order terms are neglected the average statistical parameters of sway roll and heave for ten realizations are provided in table 9 as expected the proposed frequency domain method demonstrates a favorable performance and the results are in good agreement with time domain fully coupled analysis with relative deviations of the motion amplitudes commonly within the order of 5 by contrast the solution of wang s method which neglects slow drift effects underestimates the extreme motion response substantially this demonstrates that neglecting second order coupling terms cannot be recommended as an accurate modeling strategy at least for such vessel type floaters 6 2 2 mooring line tension for the dynamic top tensions of mooring line the frequency domain analysis underestimates the standard deviation of the wf component by approximately up to 6 25 under the wave condition with parameters as h s 6 5 m t z 10 5 s the time series of the horizontal displacement and tension of mooring line top end for this wave state are presented in fig 8 it appears that such relative difference in prediction of wf dynamic tension is because of the vessel offset dependent line dynamics as aforementioned the nonlinear items are expanded about mean offset position in the frequency domain analysis it is highly demonstrated that the effects of top end displacement of mooring line especially induced by the large lf motions are not captured completely in this case the results should be of limited value for analysis in which the wf tension is dominant e g fatigue assessment although the extreme divergence is still satisfactory within engineering expectations as the results shown in table 8 and fig 8 furthermore this limitation might be mitigated to some extent by performing the wf or first order frequency domain analysis over a range of instantaneous offset positions as recommended by dnv 2001 and the hybrid method proposed by low and langley 2008a there will be a trial in the further research as for the lf component of mooring line top end tension the results appear to be comparatively more ideal within 5 as shown in table 8 one possibility is that for the deepwater floating system investigated in this work the lf top end displacement mostly originates the change in angle of the line at the fairlead rather than elastic deformation together with the action of negligible dynamic effects as a result the lf composition is in fact minimal and substantially insensitive to the change in geometry it also implies that wf component can dominate the overall dynamic tension which is clearly observed in fig 8 b moreover for the chosen cases the tension magnitudes along the mooring line are plotted in fig 9 the additional results of the least loaded line 3 are presented as a comparison and in these figures the amplitude of the dynamic tension is taken to be half the difference between the maximum and minimum values averaged from ten realizations it is found that the accuracy of the frequency domain analysis is evidently consistent with the extent of the nonlinear behavior of top end responses compared to the results of line 10 as shown in fig 9 the disparity drops for almost entire length as the top loading amplitude is reduced in line 3 however on a whole along line 10 the tension predicted by the frequency domain analysis differs from the time domain analysis by a maximum of 7 15 which is still in close agreement 6 2 3 response in touch down zone it is also notable in fig 9 that a reliable capture of the seabed interaction transition zone as indicated in subsection 2 2 3 can be obtained by the proposed frequency domain method in above calculation hyperbolic cosine function hcf is introduced to interpolate the mean position of mooring segment within the transition range to further validate its feasibility a comparative study is carried out with another quadratic interpolate function qf and the calculated standard deviations of mooring tension which are separated into wf and lf components are plotted in fig 10 for several specified points near the transitive touch down zone as another representation the corresponding time series of the mooring segment lying on this transition zone s 635 m along the line from bottom end is shown in fig 11 it is found that hyperbolic function is somewhat more appropriate with consistent to the configuration of mooring line even though it has limited influence on the responses far away 6 2 4 multi state calculation results finally to estimate the dynamic responses under variable wave conditions a set of combinations of significant wave height h s and mean zero cross period t z described by the non zero joint probability of occurrences in a wave scatter diagram of the north atlantic ocean is considered as shadowed zone in table 10 fig 12 qualitatively shows an overall comparison of the response standard derivations by different methods in this graph the abscissa is the value estimated by time domain analysis while the ordinate is provided by the given frequency domain method perfect correspondence is associated to data lying on the tilted straight line while any deviation indicates inaccuracy in the estimation the more detailed analysis results for different sea states of given h s or t z are presented in fig 13 and fig 14 excellent agreement with the results from simulations is observed under almost all the wave states with the discrepancies within 8 23 and 8 74 separately for sway motion and line tension however the results also highlight that the proposed method tends to systematically overestimate the dynamics from simulations especially when the significant wave height increases the reason may be that such severe sea state substantially accounts for the high levels of geometric nonlinearity leading to the breakdown of the assumption of small deflections in the formulation in contrast as shown in fig 13 the influence of wave period is not significant in the variation range with irregular fluctuations for the floating system on one hand the periods of exciting loads are shifted towards resonance with increasing wave period tending to induce larger dynamic responses and on the other hand opposing influence is given rise by the reduced dynamic effects from inertia and damping force from this point it can be conjectured that the overall effect is likely to be uncertain but fortunately the observable change exists in a relatively narrow range and the accuracy seems to be kept acceptable in the view for practice in the calculated cases the proposed frequency domain method requires 54 min of average computational time as compared with 20 h for a fully coupled time domain analysis for the ten runs with the node number of each mooring line set to be 800 it is obvious that the proposed frequency domain method provides significant advantages even though an advanced numerical solver is equipped in software simo and riflex 7 conclusion an efficient frequency domain approach for fully coupled analysis of floating structures is presented in this method a moment equilibrium model is introduced to generate the governing equations for mooring dynamics analysis based on the perturbation method the nonlinear dynamic equations are linearized up to second order transformation in frequency domain the velocity squared term in drag force is treated by the established technique of statistical linearization while geometric nonlinearities of mooring lines are handled with assuming perturbation procedure about the mean position moreover the line seabed interaction is also considered effectively and simplified as a reduction coefficient based on the top end motion results with the dynamic coupling between the mooring system and floater achieved by matching at the boundary point to fulfill the continuity requirement both the first and second order perturbation equations of mooring system and floating structure are established in the calculation and then solved to get the frequency response functions as verification the dynamic responses of a moored semi submersible platform under waves are calculated and compared with the results conducted by time domain analysis software simo and riflex on a whole simulation results indicate that the proposed frequency domain method is apparently accurate within engineering expectations in the present example especially for the floater motion and lf mooring line tension furthermore the line seabed interaction can be appropriately accommodated for mooring segment near tdp as indicated in the comparison results along line length hyperbolic cosine function is introduced in this work to interpolate the mean position of mooring segment within the transition zone and its feasibility has been validated however it is found that for the sea states with higher significant wave height differences of calculated results can become larger due to somewhat breakdown of the assumption of small deflections in the formulation while in contrast the wave period seems to have limited influence on the accuracy of this method and what is more it is shown that large changes in line geometry will affect the responses both in the wf and lf ranges ultimately and the induced larger scale of transitive zone near tdp could also has adverse impact on the application of the proposed method therefore it is essential to investigate the numerical performance of this method under extreme wave conditions and clarify the limited state meanwhile it is also proposed that this limitation might be mitigated to some extent by performing this frequency domain method over a range of instantaneous offset and interpolating to obtain improved results as suggested by low and langley 2008a when the geometric nonlinearity of the mooring lines is important there is a need to take further investigation on this complex scenario acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the financial support by the major program of the national natural

22979,a flume study using a surge type flow produced by quickly lifting a gate was conducted to simulate a tsunami the height of which is larger than level 1 prevention level by a hybrid system comprising a forest an embankment and a moat while changing the layout of the components the overflow volume tsunami arrival time fluid force and moment by fluid force were measured and the tsunami reduction effects in each model were compared the hybrid defense system in the order of vegetation a moat and an embankment case v40me from the sea side showed the highest reduction in overflow volume moment index and tsunami delay effect in terms of the fluid force index case v40me performed best up to a certain tsunami height for higher tsunamis a hybrid system in the order of vegetation an embankment and a moat from the sea side case v40em performed better although case v40me had a large advantage in total when there was a space landward of the existing forest suitable structures when there is space seaward and on both sides of a forest were also clarified for different wave heights through the mechanism of reflection hydraulic jump and vegetation resistance keywords energy reduction hydraulic jump vegetation resistance fluid force overflow volume 1 introduction the 2011 great east japan tsunami gejt greatly exceeded the disaster prevention level and caused catastrophic damage to buildings and forests in the coastal area tappin et al 2012 tanaka 2012 although the tsunami mitigation role of a coastal forest was widely recognized in previous research shuto 1987 hiraishi and harada 2003 harada and imamura 2006 irtem et al 2009 iimura and tanaka 2012 nandasena et al 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 after the tsunami disaster the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan mlit classified tsunamis into two categories i e level 1 in which the recurrent period is less than around a hundred years and level 2 in which the recurrent period is several hundred to a thousand years because the embankment height is designed for a level 1 tsunami a disaster mitigation method for a level 2 tsunami is needed for extreme hazards a compound defense system i e a double embankment and embankment with moat or natural and artificial structures temmerman et al 2013 are recommended to mitigate a tsunami that overtops the sea embankment the importance of facilitating combinations of natural and built infrastructures hybrid approaches is also discussed in order to enhance coastal resilience in the protection from storm and coastal flooding sutton grier et al 2015 for adapting the hybrid defense systems in a coastal environment the effect of tsunami mitigation needs to be quantified under various tsunami and forest conditions moreover it is necessary to clarify the optimal hybrid defense system for the designated area after the gejt a defense system that strengthens the disaster mitigation function of existing coastal forests by combining them with a moat and an embankment hybrid system was proposed in shiranuka town hokkaido prefecture for a future level 2 tsunami in the area as shown in fig 1 a and c hokkaido research organization forestry and forest products research institute and saitama university hfs examined in 2016 the effectiveness of the hybrid structure fig 1c by numerical simulations in the hokkaido area 40 coastal forests facing the pacific ocean may be affected by a level 2 tsunami and people and property behind the coastal forest are assumed to be damaged because there are many ways to utilize the space around a forest fig 1a and b the method to strengthen the forest needs to be clarified according to the forest type where available land exists on seaward landward or both sides of the forest the tsunami mitigation effect of a coastal forest is usually discussed in terms of the reduction of the fluid force index tanaka et al 2014 and trapping effect of floating debris pasha and tanaka 2016 tanaka and onai 2017 recently studies on compound or hybrid defense systems have been conducted they consist of a sea embankment combined with a coastal forest tanaka et al 2014 igarashi and tanaka 2018 a moat with without a forest usman et al 2014 and a double embankment system tanaka and igarashi 2016 a post gejt survey showed that a moat or canal behind an embankment presumably decreased the tsunami energy mineura et al 2013 tokida and tanimoto 2014 tsujimoto et al 2014 rahman et al 2017 a numerical simulation also demonstrated that a hybrid system comprised of a forest with inland moats effectively reduced the inundation depth and flow velocity usman et al 2014 thus experiments on compound or hybrid defense systems have started however studies of the mechanisms by which a compound or hybrid defense system decreases the tsunami energy in relation to the physical phenomenon i e increasing the reflection effect utilizing a hydraulic jump are not adequate for fully understanding and utilizing the tsunami mitigation ability of the proposed system therefore the objective of this study was to clarify the tsunami mitigation effect of hybrid defense systems in scenarios where there is constructible land in landward seaward or both sides of a coastal forest using a flume that can produce a surge type flow a coastal forest combined with a moat and an embankment was investigated by changing the order of each defense component the mitigation effects of each combination were compared paying special attention to the reflection transmission hydraulic jump and vegetation resistance 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedures a flume 1800 cm in length and 40 cm in width capable of generating a surge type flow by quickly lifting a gate was used for this study at saitama university fig 2 a and b a constant bed slope of 1 10 was set from 450 to 505 cm downstream from the gate at 505 cm from the gate the hybrid design model was laid in a horizontal bed considering the scale of the wave flume the physical scale of the model was set at 1 100 and froude similarity was applied an incoming wave was generated by setting still water depth at hs 5 5 cm and tank water depth at ht 15 20 or 25 cm corresponding wave height and water depth for ht 15 20 and 25 cm and froude numbers were estimated as 1 55 1 79 and 2 03 these can well express the tsunami inundation flow it is a little difficult to make 1 h wave period of tsunami in actual scale however in the 2011 gejt eight separate tsunami waves were recorded in around 28 min by a gps wave gauge at the northern part of iwate prefecture off coast of kuji tanaka et al 2016 the wave period was around 200 s per tsunami the wave period of this study was 150 s in actual scale using the froude similarity law although the period is slightly small this study aimed to mitigate the first wave inundation mainly for evacuation purposes thus with this flume condition the objective could be fulfilled however a large flume experiment is needed in the future for discussing the wave period effects this study targeted mitigation of a tsunami that overtops a sea embankment the wave height set in this study should be larger than the embankment height so the target tsunami is larger than level 1 level 2 even in the level 2 tsunami the tsunami height ranged widely in hokkaido therefore the tsunami height at the coast was set at around 1 2 times the embankment height 5 10 m in actual scale a level 2 tsunami in hokkaido is assumed to be around 2 35 m hfs 2016 thus the experiment does not cover all level 2 tsunami cases for larger tsunami cases experiments should be conducted using a larger wave flume and with breaking conditions of the forest and embankment because the range is wide and especially extremely high and destructive tsunami experiments are very complex this study is very important as the first step of the real situation a moat and an embankment model were built considering the tsunami condition and using wooden boards the embankment model was designed to be 40 cm in the transverse direction 6 2 cm in height and 4 cm in crown width with a 50 percent side slope the moat model was designed to be 40 cm in transverse length 5 3 cm in depth and with a 63 side slope the cross section areas of the moat model and the embankment model were made to be nearly identical for easy introduction of the system in real life because of the low transportation cost black pine is modelled in this study as a representative trees of the coastal forest because these trees are overturned when the tree crown is inundated and can maintain resistance even when the trees are overturned tanaka et al 2018 in addition at the 2011 gejt the crown height of pine trees in sendai plain was high and the trees could be assumed to be a circular cylinder tanaka et al 2014 thus a circular cylinder was selected as a vegetation model in this study consideration of vertical stand structure and breaking of trees while a tsunami inundation occurs must be tested in a future study in the coastal vegetation on the sendai plain affected by the gejt the diameter of tree trunks at breast height tree height and tree density were 0 2 0 5 m 18 m and 0 20 trees m2 respectively tanaka et al 2013 considering the real scale the tree diameter height spacing and density used in this experiment were scaled down to 0 4 cm 18 cm 2 3 cm and 0 22 cylinders cm2 respectively the coastal vegetation model was made using wooden cylinders the cylinders were set in a staggered arrangement as shown in fig 2a the vegetation length was set to be similar to the embankment and moat scale because the optimal arrangement for strengthening the existing forest is by increasing forest length or constructing artificial structures like an embankment or moat the vegetation model had three types based on the number of rows 40 60 and 80 rows for models v40 v60 and v80 respectively 2 1 1 experimental condition as shown in fig 2c to clarify the effects of the different designed hybrid defense systems on tsunami mitigation the orders of the vegetation moat and embankment were adjusted as well as the number of rows used in the vegetation model for expressing the respective cases in this study the name of each setup n v e or m were used to represent no system vegetation embankment or moat respectively subscripts of v indicate the number of vegetation rows the case names were combined in the order of the model arrangement from seaward to landward for example v40em means the model was set in the order of 40 rows of vegetation an embankment and a moat from the seaside case nnn was considered to be the control experiment for this study as a control experiment for clarifying the reflection from slope component itself a case without a slope was also conducted three wave gauges tokyo keisoku company ltd hat 106 hat 30 g1 g2 and g3 were set at 400 506 and 693 cm from the gate respectively for generating a wave the initial hydrostatic depth on the downstream side of the flume gate h s was set at 5 5 cm the initial tank water depths from the still water depth were set to 15 20 and 25 cm respectively for each run ht a bore type flow was generated by quickly lifting the gate for each case a minimum of three runs were conducted and the average of the respective data was calculated fig 3 shows the time series of water level at g2 h g2 for case nnn the fixed bed height of the hybrid model 5 5 cm was subtracted from the average of the maximum water level at g2 h g2 max and the maximum wave height h max of the measurement point at g2 was calculated reflection seaward and transmission landward were assumed to be greatly affected by the relationship between the tsunami height and embankment height therefore this study defines the non dimensional wave height h as dividing the maximum wave height by the embankment height ze eq 1 non dimensional wave heights that correspond to the tank water depth 15 20 and 25 cm were 0 81 1 23 and 1 58 respectively even when the embankment was not included in the model the non dimensional wave height for the same tank water depth was used for comparing the differences of the models 1 h h m a x z e 2 1 2 measurement method for evaluating tsunami mitigation effect to clarify mitigation effects by the hybrid defense system the reflected wave from the model delay in tsunami arrival time and overflow volume from the embankment were measured and the fluid force index u 2 h where u is the velocity and h is the water depth and moment index u 2 h 2 were estimated at least three runs were conducted for each experimental case and the average values of the overflow volume fluid force index and momentum index were calculated and compared 2 2 parameters for evaluating the effectiveness of each hybrid system 2 2 1 overflow volume from embankment to measure the overflow volume from the embankment in each case a retention pool was set behind the hybrid system landward as shown in fig 2 calibration curves for the water depth in the pool and the reserved volume were made and the overflow volume was estimated using the water depth in the pool and the calibration curve when an embankment was not included in the hybrid defense model the flow volume after passing through the vegetation model was measured in the same way and defined as overflow volume for comparison the rate of reduction of overflow volume q from the embankment was calculated from eq 2 and the effect on overflow volume in each experimental case was compared using 2 δ q q n n n q q n n n 100 where q nnn is defined as the overflow volume for the model without case nnn and q is defined in each model case because q represents the difference between case nnn and each experimental model case a higher q means a higher rate of reduction of the overflow volume 2 2 2 fluid force index and moment index for evaluating destruction of a house the necessity of considering the fluid force index u 2 h and the moment index u 2 h 2 was pointed out tanaka et al 2014 therefore the water depth h at g3 was measured in order to discuss the effect on inland house destruction in each experimental case because it was difficult to measure flow velocity and water depth at the same point the flow velocity u at 690 cm from the gate was measured by a laser doppler velocity meter kanomax smart ldvii when h 1 23 for cases v40ne and v40me the flow velocity could not be measured because the water at location g3 was very shallow although critical depth is not defined in an unsteady flow the water depth at the center of the embankment top was first assumed as critical at each time point hereafter quasi critical depth the velocity at quasi critical depth was calculated using a froude number of one and the overflow discharge was integrated by the method the integrated discharge was compared with the actual overflow volume stored in the downstream retention pool as shown in fig 2b when h 1 23 the differences for case v40ne and v40me were only around 5 and 2 respectively under this verification the maximum fluid force index eq 3 and moment index eq 4 were estimated using the quasi critical water depth the quasi critical depth is supposed to move from the embankment shoulder to a little further upstream on the embankment because it was difficult to decide the quasi critical depth location at every time point in unsteady flow experiments the water depth at the center of the embankment top ge was assumed to be the quasi critical depth and the maximum moment index eq 3 and fluid force index eq 4 were calculated as shown below 3 u 2 h 2 max v c 2 h c 2 g h c 3 4 u 2 h max v c 2 h c 2 h g 3 g h c 3 h g 3 where h g3 v c h c and g were defined as the water depth at g3 critical velocity critical depth and gravitational acceleration respectively the maximum reduction rates of the fluid force index and the moment index in the inland area were defined as rfi and rmi respectively they were calculated by eq 5 and eq 6 5 r f i u 2 h n n n u 2 h max u 2 h n n n 100 6 r m i u 2 h 2 n n n u 2 h 2 max u 2 h 2 n n n 100 where u 2 h nnn u 2 h 2 nnn u 2 h max and u 2 h 2 max are defined as the maximum values of the fluid force index and moment index where the subscript nnn represents the maximum value of the without a model case case nnn and the subscript max represents the maximum value in each model case since the indices express the difference between case nnn and each experimental case the higher rfi and rmi are the faster the reduction of the fluid force index and the moment index for comparing the differences of q rfi and rmi for each hybrid system the effect of each component e m should be clarified for that objective an embankment only case case e and a moat only case case m were also tested as the location of e has two patterns in front of and behind vegetation respectively 4 patterns mostly seaward and landward experiments case enn and case nne were conducted and the averaged values of q rfi and rmi were estimated for m a similar procedure was also applied 2 2 3 delay in tsunami arrival time because different reflected waves were generated in each case the time series of the water level after the arrival of the wave at g1 was measured g3 was used for evaluating the delay in tsunami arrival time 2 2 4 reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient for analyzing the fundamental characteristics of wave reflection and transmission the reflection coefficient c r and transmission coefficient c t are defined as 7 c r h r h i 8 c t h t h i where h i is the maximum wave height at g1 for case without a slope when there is no slope and no hybrid system h r is the maximum measured wave height at g1 and h t is the maximum measured wave height at g3 in general c r and c t were evaluated without slope condition huang et al 2011 for comparing the difference of each hybrid system the c r and c t from the coast line were evaluated because the values included the slope reflection effect a case without a slope was also conducted and the slope effects were also compared fig 2c 3 results 3 1 effects of hybrid systems on reflection and overflow volume for calculating the reduction rate of overflow volume q the fluid force index rfi moment index rmi the reflection coefficient c r and transmission coefficient c t in eqs 2 and 5 8 respectively control experiments case nnn for the wave heights were conducted the results are shown in table 1 fig 4 shows the time series of average water levels for all experimental cases and the case without a slope at g1 when h 1 58 after the waves arrived at g1 the differences in water levels were not large in the respective cases except for the case without a slope from 2 to 3 s when the gauge started to measure fig 4 a c till the reflected waves from the slope reached at g1 from 3 to 6 s the water levels for case v40me and v40em were slightly larger than those of the other cases in fig 4a this is because the vegetation model reflected the wave but the moat or embankment model located further inland still didn t have a significant effect on the water levels at g1 during that period after six seconds water levels for cases v40me v40em and v40ne became higher than those for case v80 and v40nn due to the reflection from the embankment in addition the water level of case v40me was slightly higher than those of cases v40ne and v40em due to the reflection from the moat model the reflected wave for case v80 was higher than that for case v40nn due to the increase in the number of rows in the vegetation model in fig 4b large differences can be seen from 3 to 6 s cases env40 and emv40 had a large peak around 3 4 s but the peak was smaller and delayed in case mev40 the reflected wave for case nnv40 was smaller and much delayed around 5 6 s the difference is mainly caused by the existence and location of the embankment model in fig 4c large differences could also be observed from 3 to 6 s cases ev60 and ev40m had a large peak around 3 4 s but the peak was smaller and delayed in cases mv40e and nv40n the difference was also caused by the existence and location of the embankment model comparing case mv40e fig 4c with case mev40 fig 4b showed that case mv40e maintained the larger reflection after 6 s this is due to the combined effects of a moat and vegetation snapshots of the inundation patterns taken from the video footage for cases v40ne v40me and v40em are shown in fig 5 a b and 5c respectively fig 5 a1 a3 shows snapshots for case v40ne in case v40ne overflow from the embankment occurred 2 6 s after the wave arrived at g1 fig 5a1 thereafter the water level between the vegetation and embankment was increased by reflection from the embankment fig 5a2 on the other hand in case v40me fig 5b1 b4 overflow from the embankment occurred 3 1 s after the wave arrived at g1 and the reflection by the landward slope of the moat and the seaward slope of the embankment was large fig 5b1 however the reflected wave was re reflected inland by the seaward slope of the moat fig 5b2 the overflow volume in case v40me increased slightly because the water level inside the moat was increased over the embankment height by a collision of the re reflected wave to landward and the reflected wave from the embankment fig 5b3 for case v40em fig 5c1 reflection from the seaward slope of the embankment also occurred similar to case v40me however re reflection from the vegetation was not clearly observed afterwards fig 5c2 c3 the seaward upslope of the moat in case v40me affected the fluid motion and clearly generated the re reflection fig 6 shows the reduction rate of the overflow volume q from the embankment q increased due to the existence of the embankment model that reflected the tsunami wave fig 6a shows q for seaward vegetation patterns when h increased q gradually decreased in cases v80 and v40nn q of cases v80 and v40nn were estimated around 63 55 and 54 40 respectively between h 0 81 and 1 58 when the number of rows in the vegetation model was doubled case v80 q increased by around 9 15 when h 0 81 q took a high value 88 for case e but it decreased with increasing h for case m q showed a small value 8 even when h 0 81 compared with an embankment e alone the moat itself m had a very small effect on reducing the overflow volume when h ranged from 1 23 to 1 58 q of cases v40me v40ne and v40em were estimated to be around 93 82 92 80 and 86 75 respectively compared with cases v40nn and v80 the overflow volume was decreased significantly by the existence of the embankment model compared with case e in cases v40me v40ne and v40em q increased around 34 at maximum vegetation at the seaward side of embankment significantly increased q as to a moat model compared with case v40me and case v40ne the difference in q was only 2 this implies that the moat model provided only a small benefit in terms of reducing the overflow volume therefore in terms of q case v40me performed very similarly to case v40ne overflow volume is likely to be changed by the shape of a moat its holding volume or the slope angle as shown in fig 5b2 re reflection may increase the overflow volume and thus the effect of the moat is decreased by making the landward slope of a moat steep and the seaward slope gentle the reflection seaward may be increased and overflow volume may be decreased in case v40me this should be further investigated in a future study fig 6b compares the differences among the cases where the vegetation exists on the landward side although the differences are small case mev40 is the best when h 0 81 because it can increase the reflection at the front of the embankment when h 1 58 case emv40 becomes the best because a part of the overflowing water is again reflected seaward or the overflow from the seaward embankment itself is restricted through the backwater rise in front of the vegetation or the formation of a hydraulic jump by the combination of moat and vegetation fig 6c compares the differences among the cases where vegetation exists in the center of the hybrid system q in case nv40n does not much change with h case mv40e is the best among the cases for all h because it can increase the reflection at the front side of the embankment 3 2 delay in tsunami arrival time and water level inland due to hybrid defense system the delays in the tsunami arrival time and the water level at g3 were compared with each other fig 7 shows the time series of water levels for all experimental cases at g3 when h 1 58 starting from the time that the waves arrives at g1 fig 7a shows the cases with seaward vegetation the flow in case nnn arrived at g3 at 1 9 s whereas in all the hybrid cases the arrival times were delayed the largest delay was in case v40me due to reflection by the moat and embankment model case nnn had the highest water level and all the hybrid systems decreased the maximum water level the maximum water level at g3 was decreased significantly by the existence of the landward embankment model case v40me v40ne moreover the water level for case v40em was higher than those for cases v40me and v40ne because the slope of the moat pushed the tsunami current behind the embankment upwards fig 7b shows the cases with landward vegetation the arrival time for case nnv40 was a little earlier than for cases env40 emv40 and mev40 the differences of the arrival times in cases with an embankment and a moat were small the maximum water level at g3 was decreased significantly by the existence of the embankment model especially in case emv40 the water level was greatly reduced at g3 due to the formation of a hydraulic jump in front of the vegetation and resistance by the vegetation fig 7c shows the cases with center vegetation the arrival time for case nv40n was earlier than for cases ev60 mv40e and ev40m case ev60 performed the best in delaying the tsunami arrival the backwater rise and reflection by the combination of a moat and vegetation in case mv40e greatly reduced the maximum water depth at g3 3 3 effects on reduction of fluid force index and moment index in some cases with an embankment when h 0 81 overflow from the embankment occurred but the overflow volume was very small the fluid force index and moment index for these cases could not be measured because the water level at g3 was beyond the measuring capacity of the flow velocity meter therefore the quantitative values are not shown but shown as nm in fig 8 and table 2 regardless of h the rfi in cases v80 and v40nn were about 80 and 60 respectively fig 8a1 rfi was increased by about 20 by doubling the number of rows of vegetation rfi in case e decreased with increasing h and was around 4 when h 1 58 this means that an embankment alone could not reduce rfi very much however compared with case v40ne and case e rfi was increased 61 in maximum by the existence of a front side of the vegetation regardless of h rfi for case m was around 18 compared with case v40ne and case v40me the maximum difference of rfi was 6 the difference between the rfi with and without m became smaller with increasing of h when h 1 23 rfi in case v40me were 2 6 9 and 22 higher than those in cases v40em v40ne v80 and v40nn respectively however rfi in cases v40me v40ne and v40em were lower about 12 11 and 8 respectively than that in case v80 when h 1 58 cases v40me and v40ne had a lower water level and a higher velocity than cases v80 and v40nn because the flow was supercritical behind the embankment because flow velocity greatly affects the fluid force index rfi in cases v40me and v40ne decreased with increasing h moreover as the vegetation model was in an emergent condition for cases v80 and v40nn the ratio of vegetation resistance to the flow depth did not change much however the ratio of embankment resistance to flow gradually decreased with increasing h therefore rfi in cases v40me and v40ne were lower than in case v80 while in contrast rfi in case v40em was 4 or 5 higher than that in cases v40me and v40ne respectively when h 1 58 the overtopping flow accelerated on the landward slope of the embankment but was decreased to a certain degree by the resistance of the landward slope of the moat the rfi in case v40em kept the larger value compared with other cases however the water level in case v40em was increased by the moat effect and the flow velocity in this case was higher than that in case v80 thus rfi in case v40em had a lower value than that in case v80 fig 8a2 shows rfi with respect to h for the landward vegetation type case emv40 had the largest rfi and the inundation water depth at g3 was the smallest and the flow velocity was suppressed by a moat and vegetation effect fig 7b fig 8a3 shows the rfi with respect to h for the center vegetation type case ev60 had the largest rfi although the inundation water depth at g3 was not very small fig 7c case mv40e had the smallest water depth fig 7c but rfi was not large fig 8a3 the velocity accelerated on the slope of the embankment e and the velocity in case mv40e was supposed to be larger compared with that of case ev60 rmi was increased by about 10 in case v80 compared with case v40nn because the number of rows in the vegetation model was twice that in case v80 fig 8b1 there was almost no difference between rmi in cases v40me and v40ne due to the existence of the moat model unlike rfi the rmi values of cases v40me and v40ne were the highest even when h 1 58 because the flow velocity and water level affected the moment index to the same degree in contrast in case v40em the reduction rate of rmi with increasing h was higher than those in cases v40me and v40ne because the water level in case v40em at g3 was high fig 8b2 shows rmi with respect to h for the landward vegetation type case emv40 had the largest rmi similar to rfi fig 8b3 shows the rmi with respect to h for the center vegetation type case ev60 had the largest rmi similar to rfi compared with case mv40e and case ev40m the water was deeper in case ev40m than that in case v40me the water depth effect was greater in the case of rmi so the order of case mv40e and case ev40m was changed in comparison with rfi fig 8a3 4 discussion 4 1 differences of each hybrid system for selecting an optimal hybrid system c r c t q rfi and rmi were compared table 2 when the reflection due to obstructions i e vegetation moat or embankment was large transmission decreased and the overflowing water volume became small when the reflection seaward increases c r takes a larger value and q increases overflow volume decreases on contrary when c t is large q decreases overflow volume increases therefore the tendencies of c r and q showed similar trends and c t and q showed opposite trends within each vegetation type however when the hybrid system had a moat model on the landward side the water depth at g3 increased due to the backwater rise by the moat model thus c t took large values even though q was large then the opposite trend was not seen table 2 shows the standard deviation sd in each hybrid model experiments were conducted three times sd of q rfi and rmi are mostly far smaller than the differences in cases therefore the tendency described in figs 6 and 8 could be considered a meaningful difference however the order of the effectiveness was changed with h as already described for discussing the total effectiveness of each hybrid system below four evaluation indices were defined 9 e δ q i 1 3 h δ q a i i 1 3 h i 10 e a t i 1 2 h a t a a t n n n a i i 1 2 h i 11 e r f i i 1 2 h r f i a i i 1 2 h i 12 e r m i i 1 2 h r m i a i i 1 2 h i where e q e at e rfi and e rmi are the evaluation index for q arrival time rfi and rmi respectively q a rfi a and rmi a mean the average values of q rfi and rmi respectively for each model and wave height at nnna and at a mean the average arrival time for the control case nnn and each hybrid model respectively for the summation σ i should be from 1 to 3 three wave heights however in some of the cases with the embankment and h 0 81 arrival time rfi and rmi could not be measured therefore e at e rfi and e rmi were only estimated for wave height h 1 23 and 1 58 and therefore for eqs 10 12 i is only from 1 to 2 the effectiveness was totally evaluated using the four evaluation indices as shown in table 3 in table 3 the first second and third most advantageous structures are indicated as a double circle circle and triangle respectively for case e the effectiveness was confirmed in e q and e rmi but not in e at and e rfi seaward vegetation increased the entire index compared with case v40ne and case e landward vegetation increases three indexes other than e q a combination of vegetation and embankment was found to be very effective from these cases in contrast case m took small values for all indices however the combination of moat and other components increased some of the indexes for example e at increased in case v40me in comparison with case v40ne and e rfi and e rmi took high values in case emv40 compared with case env40 for reducing the overflow volume arrival time and moment by fluid force case v40me was the best among the tested cases if there is space behind an existing coastal forest this is the optimal option for strengthening the mitigation function this case corresponds to the pilot project structure in fig 1c compared with case nnn case v40me reduced the overflow volume around 100 75 due to the reflection effect therefore the fluid force index and moment index behind an embankment was decreased greatly up to some degree of tsunami magnitude expressed in this study as h however there is a possibility that the fluid force index increases when it is evaluated just behind the embankment toe because flow velocity accelerates on the landward slope of the embankment in case v40me especially when the overflow water is deep for reducing the fluid force some structures are needed behind the embankment e rfi shows that case emv40 is the best this structure can be constructed when there is a space on the seaward side of an existing coastal forest when the growth of seaward coastal trees is not good due to strong winds and salt spray a good option is to replace the unhealthy seaward forest with an embankment and moat this type is also discussed qualitatively in the pilot project hfs 2016 4 2 optimal hybrid structure for huge tsunami when a level 2 tsunami greatly exceeds the tree height or tree crown height trees may be destroyed sato et al 2012 if the trees are overturned or tree height is lower than the tsunami inundation depth the tsunami current can easily pass through the top layer of vegetation the effective hybrid system summarized in table 3 may be changed in that case similar experiments for a hybrid system using submerged vegetation should be conducted in the near future the optimal hybrid structure should be based on the available space for the existing forest when there is space landward of an existing forest case v40me can strengthen the tsunami mitigation function however the structure has a slight disadvantage because a coastal forest itself is a little weak in the first attack by a tsunami the impact force also acts in addition to a drag force and tree trunk breakage has a possibility of occurring tanaka et al 2013 although the destructive mode can produce floating debris and secondary damage may occur the disadvantage of producing driftwood was small compared with the advantage of reducing the tsunami s fluid force in the case of the sendai plain in the gejt tanaka and ogino 2017 in addition after reflection from the embankment occurs the driftwood could be transported to the seaward side therefore case v40me is recommended even considering the disadvantage when there is a space seaside case emv40 is optimal it has the advantage of reducing the fluid force on a coastal forest can reduce the destruction of the forest itself and can increase the mitigation effect by trapping driftwood tanaka and onai 2017 when there is available space but not enough both seaward and landward center vegetation type there is the option of increasing the vegetation length because the effectiveness changes with vegetation length and the stand structure of trees it should be clarified in general by numerical simulations like those of tanaka et al 2017 which include the destruction modes of coastal trees this study investigated three vegetation lengths 40 60 and 80 rows this study modelled 40 cm diameter trees on a real scale according to the actual pine tree breakage in the 2011 gejt tanaka et al 2013 the 40 cm diameter tree is assumed not to be broken when h 1 23 however the trend suggested that some of the trees especially on the seaward side of vegetation may be overturned when h 1 58 even in that case igarashi and tanaka 2018 demonstrated that as few as two rows of vegetation can increase the reflection when the vegetation was set on the seaward side of the embankment even when the trees are overturned they increase the reflection after the reflection from the embankment had started in the optimal seaward vegetation type case v40me the forest length should be discussed in more detail including the two destruction modes overturning driftwood is not produced and tree trunk breakage driftwood is produced at gejt much erosion behind the embankment occurred tappin et al 2012 tanaka and sato 2015 case mev40 has a possibility to produce driftwood by accelerating the downward flow from the embankment in order to suppress the production of driftwood case emv40 is more suitable than case mev40 for the landward vegetation in addition this study selected the same sizes for a moat and an embankment although the tsunami mitigation effect of a moat was confirmed in this study when it was located on the seaward side of an embankment its effect was not high due to the re reflection from the seaward slope there is a possibility of increasing the tsunami mitigation effects by changing the shape and volume of the moat in the future studies on the size and shape of the moat are needed to demonstrate its effect 5 summary and conclusions the conclusions derived from this study are listed below a hybrid defense system in the order of vegetation a moat and an embankment from the seaward side case v40me showed the highest reduction in overflow volume and in delaying the tsunami wave in case v40me the effect of the moat itself was estimated to be low however the overflow volume from an embankment may be decreased because a re reflected wave to the landward side is created by the seaward slope of the moat the shape of the moat affects the reduction of overflow volume and tsunami delay and therefore this should be discussed in a future study the reduction of the fluid force index in case v40me was highest when h was small on the other hand case v80 had the highest reduction in fluid force index when h was high this is because the reflection effect by the embankment is weak when the flow is deep the hybrid system in the order of vegetation an embankment and a moat from the seaside case v40em had higher a reduction effect of the fluid force index than that of case v40me in high h conditions because the moat located landward of the embankment case v40em decreased the overtopping flow velocity from the embankment with increasing h the fluid force index was suppressed however since this case had a higher water level at the inland side than case v40me in high h conditions the reduction rate of the moment index for case v40em was lower than for case v40me four indices are proposed for evaluating the total advantage the analysis clearly shows that case v40me had the greatest advantage when there was space available landward of an existing forest for utilizing the seaward space of an existing forest case emv40 was found to be the best when there was limited space on both sides of an existing forest the advantage of the hybrid system declines but there is an option of increasing the forest length itself acknowledgements this study was partly funded by a jsps grant in

22979,a flume study using a surge type flow produced by quickly lifting a gate was conducted to simulate a tsunami the height of which is larger than level 1 prevention level by a hybrid system comprising a forest an embankment and a moat while changing the layout of the components the overflow volume tsunami arrival time fluid force and moment by fluid force were measured and the tsunami reduction effects in each model were compared the hybrid defense system in the order of vegetation a moat and an embankment case v40me from the sea side showed the highest reduction in overflow volume moment index and tsunami delay effect in terms of the fluid force index case v40me performed best up to a certain tsunami height for higher tsunamis a hybrid system in the order of vegetation an embankment and a moat from the sea side case v40em performed better although case v40me had a large advantage in total when there was a space landward of the existing forest suitable structures when there is space seaward and on both sides of a forest were also clarified for different wave heights through the mechanism of reflection hydraulic jump and vegetation resistance keywords energy reduction hydraulic jump vegetation resistance fluid force overflow volume 1 introduction the 2011 great east japan tsunami gejt greatly exceeded the disaster prevention level and caused catastrophic damage to buildings and forests in the coastal area tappin et al 2012 tanaka 2012 although the tsunami mitigation role of a coastal forest was widely recognized in previous research shuto 1987 hiraishi and harada 2003 harada and imamura 2006 irtem et al 2009 iimura and tanaka 2012 nandasena et al 2012 pasha and tanaka 2017 after the tsunami disaster the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan mlit classified tsunamis into two categories i e level 1 in which the recurrent period is less than around a hundred years and level 2 in which the recurrent period is several hundred to a thousand years because the embankment height is designed for a level 1 tsunami a disaster mitigation method for a level 2 tsunami is needed for extreme hazards a compound defense system i e a double embankment and embankment with moat or natural and artificial structures temmerman et al 2013 are recommended to mitigate a tsunami that overtops the sea embankment the importance of facilitating combinations of natural and built infrastructures hybrid approaches is also discussed in order to enhance coastal resilience in the protection from storm and coastal flooding sutton grier et al 2015 for adapting the hybrid defense systems in a coastal environment the effect of tsunami mitigation needs to be quantified under various tsunami and forest conditions moreover it is necessary to clarify the optimal hybrid defense system for the designated area after the gejt a defense system that strengthens the disaster mitigation function of existing coastal forests by combining them with a moat and an embankment hybrid system was proposed in shiranuka town hokkaido prefecture for a future level 2 tsunami in the area as shown in fig 1 a and c hokkaido research organization forestry and forest products research institute and saitama university hfs examined in 2016 the effectiveness of the hybrid structure fig 1c by numerical simulations in the hokkaido area 40 coastal forests facing the pacific ocean may be affected by a level 2 tsunami and people and property behind the coastal forest are assumed to be damaged because there are many ways to utilize the space around a forest fig 1a and b the method to strengthen the forest needs to be clarified according to the forest type where available land exists on seaward landward or both sides of the forest the tsunami mitigation effect of a coastal forest is usually discussed in terms of the reduction of the fluid force index tanaka et al 2014 and trapping effect of floating debris pasha and tanaka 2016 tanaka and onai 2017 recently studies on compound or hybrid defense systems have been conducted they consist of a sea embankment combined with a coastal forest tanaka et al 2014 igarashi and tanaka 2018 a moat with without a forest usman et al 2014 and a double embankment system tanaka and igarashi 2016 a post gejt survey showed that a moat or canal behind an embankment presumably decreased the tsunami energy mineura et al 2013 tokida and tanimoto 2014 tsujimoto et al 2014 rahman et al 2017 a numerical simulation also demonstrated that a hybrid system comprised of a forest with inland moats effectively reduced the inundation depth and flow velocity usman et al 2014 thus experiments on compound or hybrid defense systems have started however studies of the mechanisms by which a compound or hybrid defense system decreases the tsunami energy in relation to the physical phenomenon i e increasing the reflection effect utilizing a hydraulic jump are not adequate for fully understanding and utilizing the tsunami mitigation ability of the proposed system therefore the objective of this study was to clarify the tsunami mitigation effect of hybrid defense systems in scenarios where there is constructible land in landward seaward or both sides of a coastal forest using a flume that can produce a surge type flow a coastal forest combined with a moat and an embankment was investigated by changing the order of each defense component the mitigation effects of each combination were compared paying special attention to the reflection transmission hydraulic jump and vegetation resistance 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and procedures a flume 1800 cm in length and 40 cm in width capable of generating a surge type flow by quickly lifting a gate was used for this study at saitama university fig 2 a and b a constant bed slope of 1 10 was set from 450 to 505 cm downstream from the gate at 505 cm from the gate the hybrid design model was laid in a horizontal bed considering the scale of the wave flume the physical scale of the model was set at 1 100 and froude similarity was applied an incoming wave was generated by setting still water depth at hs 5 5 cm and tank water depth at ht 15 20 or 25 cm corresponding wave height and water depth for ht 15 20 and 25 cm and froude numbers were estimated as 1 55 1 79 and 2 03 these can well express the tsunami inundation flow it is a little difficult to make 1 h wave period of tsunami in actual scale however in the 2011 gejt eight separate tsunami waves were recorded in around 28 min by a gps wave gauge at the northern part of iwate prefecture off coast of kuji tanaka et al 2016 the wave period was around 200 s per tsunami the wave period of this study was 150 s in actual scale using the froude similarity law although the period is slightly small this study aimed to mitigate the first wave inundation mainly for evacuation purposes thus with this flume condition the objective could be fulfilled however a large flume experiment is needed in the future for discussing the wave period effects this study targeted mitigation of a tsunami that overtops a sea embankment the wave height set in this study should be larger than the embankment height so the target tsunami is larger than level 1 level 2 even in the level 2 tsunami the tsunami height ranged widely in hokkaido therefore the tsunami height at the coast was set at around 1 2 times the embankment height 5 10 m in actual scale a level 2 tsunami in hokkaido is assumed to be around 2 35 m hfs 2016 thus the experiment does not cover all level 2 tsunami cases for larger tsunami cases experiments should be conducted using a larger wave flume and with breaking conditions of the forest and embankment because the range is wide and especially extremely high and destructive tsunami experiments are very complex this study is very important as the first step of the real situation a moat and an embankment model were built considering the tsunami condition and using wooden boards the embankment model was designed to be 40 cm in the transverse direction 6 2 cm in height and 4 cm in crown width with a 50 percent side slope the moat model was designed to be 40 cm in transverse length 5 3 cm in depth and with a 63 side slope the cross section areas of the moat model and the embankment model were made to be nearly identical for easy introduction of the system in real life because of the low transportation cost black pine is modelled in this study as a representative trees of the coastal forest because these trees are overturned when the tree crown is inundated and can maintain resistance even when the trees are overturned tanaka et al 2018 in addition at the 2011 gejt the crown height of pine trees in sendai plain was high and the trees could be assumed to be a circular cylinder tanaka et al 2014 thus a circular cylinder was selected as a vegetation model in this study consideration of vertical stand structure and breaking of trees while a tsunami inundation occurs must be tested in a future study in the coastal vegetation on the sendai plain affected by the gejt the diameter of tree trunks at breast height tree height and tree density were 0 2 0 5 m 18 m and 0 20 trees m2 respectively tanaka et al 2013 considering the real scale the tree diameter height spacing and density used in this experiment were scaled down to 0 4 cm 18 cm 2 3 cm and 0 22 cylinders cm2 respectively the coastal vegetation model was made using wooden cylinders the cylinders were set in a staggered arrangement as shown in fig 2a the vegetation length was set to be similar to the embankment and moat scale because the optimal arrangement for strengthening the existing forest is by increasing forest length or constructing artificial structures like an embankment or moat the vegetation model had three types based on the number of rows 40 60 and 80 rows for models v40 v60 and v80 respectively 2 1 1 experimental condition as shown in fig 2c to clarify the effects of the different designed hybrid defense systems on tsunami mitigation the orders of the vegetation moat and embankment were adjusted as well as the number of rows used in the vegetation model for expressing the respective cases in this study the name of each setup n v e or m were used to represent no system vegetation embankment or moat respectively subscripts of v indicate the number of vegetation rows the case names were combined in the order of the model arrangement from seaward to landward for example v40em means the model was set in the order of 40 rows of vegetation an embankment and a moat from the seaside case nnn was considered to be the control experiment for this study as a control experiment for clarifying the reflection from slope component itself a case without a slope was also conducted three wave gauges tokyo keisoku company ltd hat 106 hat 30 g1 g2 and g3 were set at 400 506 and 693 cm from the gate respectively for generating a wave the initial hydrostatic depth on the downstream side of the flume gate h s was set at 5 5 cm the initial tank water depths from the still water depth were set to 15 20 and 25 cm respectively for each run ht a bore type flow was generated by quickly lifting the gate for each case a minimum of three runs were conducted and the average of the respective data was calculated fig 3 shows the time series of water level at g2 h g2 for case nnn the fixed bed height of the hybrid model 5 5 cm was subtracted from the average of the maximum water level at g2 h g2 max and the maximum wave height h max of the measurement point at g2 was calculated reflection seaward and transmission landward were assumed to be greatly affected by the relationship between the tsunami height and embankment height therefore this study defines the non dimensional wave height h as dividing the maximum wave height by the embankment height ze eq 1 non dimensional wave heights that correspond to the tank water depth 15 20 and 25 cm were 0 81 1 23 and 1 58 respectively even when the embankment was not included in the model the non dimensional wave height for the same tank water depth was used for comparing the differences of the models 1 h h m a x z e 2 1 2 measurement method for evaluating tsunami mitigation effect to clarify mitigation effects by the hybrid defense system the reflected wave from the model delay in tsunami arrival time and overflow volume from the embankment were measured and the fluid force index u 2 h where u is the velocity and h is the water depth and moment index u 2 h 2 were estimated at least three runs were conducted for each experimental case and the average values of the overflow volume fluid force index and momentum index were calculated and compared 2 2 parameters for evaluating the effectiveness of each hybrid system 2 2 1 overflow volume from embankment to measure the overflow volume from the embankment in each case a retention pool was set behind the hybrid system landward as shown in fig 2 calibration curves for the water depth in the pool and the reserved volume were made and the overflow volume was estimated using the water depth in the pool and the calibration curve when an embankment was not included in the hybrid defense model the flow volume after passing through the vegetation model was measured in the same way and defined as overflow volume for comparison the rate of reduction of overflow volume q from the embankment was calculated from eq 2 and the effect on overflow volume in each experimental case was compared using 2 δ q q n n n q q n n n 100 where q nnn is defined as the overflow volume for the model without case nnn and q is defined in each model case because q represents the difference between case nnn and each experimental model case a higher q means a higher rate of reduction of the overflow volume 2 2 2 fluid force index and moment index for evaluating destruction of a house the necessity of considering the fluid force index u 2 h and the moment index u 2 h 2 was pointed out tanaka et al 2014 therefore the water depth h at g3 was measured in order to discuss the effect on inland house destruction in each experimental case because it was difficult to measure flow velocity and water depth at the same point the flow velocity u at 690 cm from the gate was measured by a laser doppler velocity meter kanomax smart ldvii when h 1 23 for cases v40ne and v40me the flow velocity could not be measured because the water at location g3 was very shallow although critical depth is not defined in an unsteady flow the water depth at the center of the embankment top was first assumed as critical at each time point hereafter quasi critical depth the velocity at quasi critical depth was calculated using a froude number of one and the overflow discharge was integrated by the method the integrated discharge was compared with the actual overflow volume stored in the downstream retention pool as shown in fig 2b when h 1 23 the differences for case v40ne and v40me were only around 5 and 2 respectively under this verification the maximum fluid force index eq 3 and moment index eq 4 were estimated using the quasi critical water depth the quasi critical depth is supposed to move from the embankment shoulder to a little further upstream on the embankment because it was difficult to decide the quasi critical depth location at every time point in unsteady flow experiments the water depth at the center of the embankment top ge was assumed to be the quasi critical depth and the maximum moment index eq 3 and fluid force index eq 4 were calculated as shown below 3 u 2 h 2 max v c 2 h c 2 g h c 3 4 u 2 h max v c 2 h c 2 h g 3 g h c 3 h g 3 where h g3 v c h c and g were defined as the water depth at g3 critical velocity critical depth and gravitational acceleration respectively the maximum reduction rates of the fluid force index and the moment index in the inland area were defined as rfi and rmi respectively they were calculated by eq 5 and eq 6 5 r f i u 2 h n n n u 2 h max u 2 h n n n 100 6 r m i u 2 h 2 n n n u 2 h 2 max u 2 h 2 n n n 100 where u 2 h nnn u 2 h 2 nnn u 2 h max and u 2 h 2 max are defined as the maximum values of the fluid force index and moment index where the subscript nnn represents the maximum value of the without a model case case nnn and the subscript max represents the maximum value in each model case since the indices express the difference between case nnn and each experimental case the higher rfi and rmi are the faster the reduction of the fluid force index and the moment index for comparing the differences of q rfi and rmi for each hybrid system the effect of each component e m should be clarified for that objective an embankment only case case e and a moat only case case m were also tested as the location of e has two patterns in front of and behind vegetation respectively 4 patterns mostly seaward and landward experiments case enn and case nne were conducted and the averaged values of q rfi and rmi were estimated for m a similar procedure was also applied 2 2 3 delay in tsunami arrival time because different reflected waves were generated in each case the time series of the water level after the arrival of the wave at g1 was measured g3 was used for evaluating the delay in tsunami arrival time 2 2 4 reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient for analyzing the fundamental characteristics of wave reflection and transmission the reflection coefficient c r and transmission coefficient c t are defined as 7 c r h r h i 8 c t h t h i where h i is the maximum wave height at g1 for case without a slope when there is no slope and no hybrid system h r is the maximum measured wave height at g1 and h t is the maximum measured wave height at g3 in general c r and c t were evaluated without slope condition huang et al 2011 for comparing the difference of each hybrid system the c r and c t from the coast line were evaluated because the values included the slope reflection effect a case without a slope was also conducted and the slope effects were also compared fig 2c 3 results 3 1 effects of hybrid systems on reflection and overflow volume for calculating the reduction rate of overflow volume q the fluid force index rfi moment index rmi the reflection coefficient c r and transmission coefficient c t in eqs 2 and 5 8 respectively control experiments case nnn for the wave heights were conducted the results are shown in table 1 fig 4 shows the time series of average water levels for all experimental cases and the case without a slope at g1 when h 1 58 after the waves arrived at g1 the differences in water levels were not large in the respective cases except for the case without a slope from 2 to 3 s when the gauge started to measure fig 4 a c till the reflected waves from the slope reached at g1 from 3 to 6 s the water levels for case v40me and v40em were slightly larger than those of the other cases in fig 4a this is because the vegetation model reflected the wave but the moat or embankment model located further inland still didn t have a significant effect on the water levels at g1 during that period after six seconds water levels for cases v40me v40em and v40ne became higher than those for case v80 and v40nn due to the reflection from the embankment in addition the water level of case v40me was slightly higher than those of cases v40ne and v40em due to the reflection from the moat model the reflected wave for case v80 was higher than that for case v40nn due to the increase in the number of rows in the vegetation model in fig 4b large differences can be seen from 3 to 6 s cases env40 and emv40 had a large peak around 3 4 s but the peak was smaller and delayed in case mev40 the reflected wave for case nnv40 was smaller and much delayed around 5 6 s the difference is mainly caused by the existence and location of the embankment model in fig 4c large differences could also be observed from 3 to 6 s cases ev60 and ev40m had a large peak around 3 4 s but the peak was smaller and delayed in cases mv40e and nv40n the difference was also caused by the existence and location of the embankment model comparing case mv40e fig 4c with case mev40 fig 4b showed that case mv40e maintained the larger reflection after 6 s this is due to the combined effects of a moat and vegetation snapshots of the inundation patterns taken from the video footage for cases v40ne v40me and v40em are shown in fig 5 a b and 5c respectively fig 5 a1 a3 shows snapshots for case v40ne in case v40ne overflow from the embankment occurred 2 6 s after the wave arrived at g1 fig 5a1 thereafter the water level between the vegetation and embankment was increased by reflection from the embankment fig 5a2 on the other hand in case v40me fig 5b1 b4 overflow from the embankment occurred 3 1 s after the wave arrived at g1 and the reflection by the landward slope of the moat and the seaward slope of the embankment was large fig 5b1 however the reflected wave was re reflected inland by the seaward slope of the moat fig 5b2 the overflow volume in case v40me increased slightly because the water level inside the moat was increased over the embankment height by a collision of the re reflected wave to landward and the reflected wave from the embankment fig 5b3 for case v40em fig 5c1 reflection from the seaward slope of the embankment also occurred similar to case v40me however re reflection from the vegetation was not clearly observed afterwards fig 5c2 c3 the seaward upslope of the moat in case v40me affected the fluid motion and clearly generated the re reflection fig 6 shows the reduction rate of the overflow volume q from the embankment q increased due to the existence of the embankment model that reflected the tsunami wave fig 6a shows q for seaward vegetation patterns when h increased q gradually decreased in cases v80 and v40nn q of cases v80 and v40nn were estimated around 63 55 and 54 40 respectively between h 0 81 and 1 58 when the number of rows in the vegetation model was doubled case v80 q increased by around 9 15 when h 0 81 q took a high value 88 for case e but it decreased with increasing h for case m q showed a small value 8 even when h 0 81 compared with an embankment e alone the moat itself m had a very small effect on reducing the overflow volume when h ranged from 1 23 to 1 58 q of cases v40me v40ne and v40em were estimated to be around 93 82 92 80 and 86 75 respectively compared with cases v40nn and v80 the overflow volume was decreased significantly by the existence of the embankment model compared with case e in cases v40me v40ne and v40em q increased around 34 at maximum vegetation at the seaward side of embankment significantly increased q as to a moat model compared with case v40me and case v40ne the difference in q was only 2 this implies that the moat model provided only a small benefit in terms of reducing the overflow volume therefore in terms of q case v40me performed very similarly to case v40ne overflow volume is likely to be changed by the shape of a moat its holding volume or the slope angle as shown in fig 5b2 re reflection may increase the overflow volume and thus the effect of the moat is decreased by making the landward slope of a moat steep and the seaward slope gentle the reflection seaward may be increased and overflow volume may be decreased in case v40me this should be further investigated in a future study fig 6b compares the differences among the cases where the vegetation exists on the landward side although the differences are small case mev40 is the best when h 0 81 because it can increase the reflection at the front of the embankment when h 1 58 case emv40 becomes the best because a part of the overflowing water is again reflected seaward or the overflow from the seaward embankment itself is restricted through the backwater rise in front of the vegetation or the formation of a hydraulic jump by the combination of moat and vegetation fig 6c compares the differences among the cases where vegetation exists in the center of the hybrid system q in case nv40n does not much change with h case mv40e is the best among the cases for all h because it can increase the reflection at the front side of the embankment 3 2 delay in tsunami arrival time and water level inland due to hybrid defense system the delays in the tsunami arrival time and the water level at g3 were compared with each other fig 7 shows the time series of water levels for all experimental cases at g3 when h 1 58 starting from the time that the waves arrives at g1 fig 7a shows the cases with seaward vegetation the flow in case nnn arrived at g3 at 1 9 s whereas in all the hybrid cases the arrival times were delayed the largest delay was in case v40me due to reflection by the moat and embankment model case nnn had the highest water level and all the hybrid systems decreased the maximum water level the maximum water level at g3 was decreased significantly by the existence of the landward embankment model case v40me v40ne moreover the water level for case v40em was higher than those for cases v40me and v40ne because the slope of the moat pushed the tsunami current behind the embankment upwards fig 7b shows the cases with landward vegetation the arrival time for case nnv40 was a little earlier than for cases env40 emv40 and mev40 the differences of the arrival times in cases with an embankment and a moat were small the maximum water level at g3 was decreased significantly by the existence of the embankment model especially in case emv40 the water level was greatly reduced at g3 due to the formation of a hydraulic jump in front of the vegetation and resistance by the vegetation fig 7c shows the cases with center vegetation the arrival time for case nv40n was earlier than for cases ev60 mv40e and ev40m case ev60 performed the best in delaying the tsunami arrival the backwater rise and reflection by the combination of a moat and vegetation in case mv40e greatly reduced the maximum water depth at g3 3 3 effects on reduction of fluid force index and moment index in some cases with an embankment when h 0 81 overflow from the embankment occurred but the overflow volume was very small the fluid force index and moment index for these cases could not be measured because the water level at g3 was beyond the measuring capacity of the flow velocity meter therefore the quantitative values are not shown but shown as nm in fig 8 and table 2 regardless of h the rfi in cases v80 and v40nn were about 80 and 60 respectively fig 8a1 rfi was increased by about 20 by doubling the number of rows of vegetation rfi in case e decreased with increasing h and was around 4 when h 1 58 this means that an embankment alone could not reduce rfi very much however compared with case v40ne and case e rfi was increased 61 in maximum by the existence of a front side of the vegetation regardless of h rfi for case m was around 18 compared with case v40ne and case v40me the maximum difference of rfi was 6 the difference between the rfi with and without m became smaller with increasing of h when h 1 23 rfi in case v40me were 2 6 9 and 22 higher than those in cases v40em v40ne v80 and v40nn respectively however rfi in cases v40me v40ne and v40em were lower about 12 11 and 8 respectively than that in case v80 when h 1 58 cases v40me and v40ne had a lower water level and a higher velocity than cases v80 and v40nn because the flow was supercritical behind the embankment because flow velocity greatly affects the fluid force index rfi in cases v40me and v40ne decreased with increasing h moreover as the vegetation model was in an emergent condition for cases v80 and v40nn the ratio of vegetation resistance to the flow depth did not change much however the ratio of embankment resistance to flow gradually decreased with increasing h therefore rfi in cases v40me and v40ne were lower than in case v80 while in contrast rfi in case v40em was 4 or 5 higher than that in cases v40me and v40ne respectively when h 1 58 the overtopping flow accelerated on the landward slope of the embankment but was decreased to a certain degree by the resistance of the landward slope of the moat the rfi in case v40em kept the larger value compared with other cases however the water level in case v40em was increased by the moat effect and the flow velocity in this case was higher than that in case v80 thus rfi in case v40em had a lower value than that in case v80 fig 8a2 shows rfi with respect to h for the landward vegetation type case emv40 had the largest rfi and the inundation water depth at g3 was the smallest and the flow velocity was suppressed by a moat and vegetation effect fig 7b fig 8a3 shows the rfi with respect to h for the center vegetation type case ev60 had the largest rfi although the inundation water depth at g3 was not very small fig 7c case mv40e had the smallest water depth fig 7c but rfi was not large fig 8a3 the velocity accelerated on the slope of the embankment e and the velocity in case mv40e was supposed to be larger compared with that of case ev60 rmi was increased by about 10 in case v80 compared with case v40nn because the number of rows in the vegetation model was twice that in case v80 fig 8b1 there was almost no difference between rmi in cases v40me and v40ne due to the existence of the moat model unlike rfi the rmi values of cases v40me and v40ne were the highest even when h 1 58 because the flow velocity and water level affected the moment index to the same degree in contrast in case v40em the reduction rate of rmi with increasing h was higher than those in cases v40me and v40ne because the water level in case v40em at g3 was high fig 8b2 shows rmi with respect to h for the landward vegetation type case emv40 had the largest rmi similar to rfi fig 8b3 shows the rmi with respect to h for the center vegetation type case ev60 had the largest rmi similar to rfi compared with case mv40e and case ev40m the water was deeper in case ev40m than that in case v40me the water depth effect was greater in the case of rmi so the order of case mv40e and case ev40m was changed in comparison with rfi fig 8a3 4 discussion 4 1 differences of each hybrid system for selecting an optimal hybrid system c r c t q rfi and rmi were compared table 2 when the reflection due to obstructions i e vegetation moat or embankment was large transmission decreased and the overflowing water volume became small when the reflection seaward increases c r takes a larger value and q increases overflow volume decreases on contrary when c t is large q decreases overflow volume increases therefore the tendencies of c r and q showed similar trends and c t and q showed opposite trends within each vegetation type however when the hybrid system had a moat model on the landward side the water depth at g3 increased due to the backwater rise by the moat model thus c t took large values even though q was large then the opposite trend was not seen table 2 shows the standard deviation sd in each hybrid model experiments were conducted three times sd of q rfi and rmi are mostly far smaller than the differences in cases therefore the tendency described in figs 6 and 8 could be considered a meaningful difference however the order of the effectiveness was changed with h as already described for discussing the total effectiveness of each hybrid system below four evaluation indices were defined 9 e δ q i 1 3 h δ q a i i 1 3 h i 10 e a t i 1 2 h a t a a t n n n a i i 1 2 h i 11 e r f i i 1 2 h r f i a i i 1 2 h i 12 e r m i i 1 2 h r m i a i i 1 2 h i where e q e at e rfi and e rmi are the evaluation index for q arrival time rfi and rmi respectively q a rfi a and rmi a mean the average values of q rfi and rmi respectively for each model and wave height at nnna and at a mean the average arrival time for the control case nnn and each hybrid model respectively for the summation σ i should be from 1 to 3 three wave heights however in some of the cases with the embankment and h 0 81 arrival time rfi and rmi could not be measured therefore e at e rfi and e rmi were only estimated for wave height h 1 23 and 1 58 and therefore for eqs 10 12 i is only from 1 to 2 the effectiveness was totally evaluated using the four evaluation indices as shown in table 3 in table 3 the first second and third most advantageous structures are indicated as a double circle circle and triangle respectively for case e the effectiveness was confirmed in e q and e rmi but not in e at and e rfi seaward vegetation increased the entire index compared with case v40ne and case e landward vegetation increases three indexes other than e q a combination of vegetation and embankment was found to be very effective from these cases in contrast case m took small values for all indices however the combination of moat and other components increased some of the indexes for example e at increased in case v40me in comparison with case v40ne and e rfi and e rmi took high values in case emv40 compared with case env40 for reducing the overflow volume arrival time and moment by fluid force case v40me was the best among the tested cases if there is space behind an existing coastal forest this is the optimal option for strengthening the mitigation function this case corresponds to the pilot project structure in fig 1c compared with case nnn case v40me reduced the overflow volume around 100 75 due to the reflection effect therefore the fluid force index and moment index behind an embankment was decreased greatly up to some degree of tsunami magnitude expressed in this study as h however there is a possibility that the fluid force index increases when it is evaluated just behind the embankment toe because flow velocity accelerates on the landward slope of the embankment in case v40me especially when the overflow water is deep for reducing the fluid force some structures are needed behind the embankment e rfi shows that case emv40 is the best this structure can be constructed when there is a space on the seaward side of an existing coastal forest when the growth of seaward coastal trees is not good due to strong winds and salt spray a good option is to replace the unhealthy seaward forest with an embankment and moat this type is also discussed qualitatively in the pilot project hfs 2016 4 2 optimal hybrid structure for huge tsunami when a level 2 tsunami greatly exceeds the tree height or tree crown height trees may be destroyed sato et al 2012 if the trees are overturned or tree height is lower than the tsunami inundation depth the tsunami current can easily pass through the top layer of vegetation the effective hybrid system summarized in table 3 may be changed in that case similar experiments for a hybrid system using submerged vegetation should be conducted in the near future the optimal hybrid structure should be based on the available space for the existing forest when there is space landward of an existing forest case v40me can strengthen the tsunami mitigation function however the structure has a slight disadvantage because a coastal forest itself is a little weak in the first attack by a tsunami the impact force also acts in addition to a drag force and tree trunk breakage has a possibility of occurring tanaka et al 2013 although the destructive mode can produce floating debris and secondary damage may occur the disadvantage of producing driftwood was small compared with the advantage of reducing the tsunami s fluid force in the case of the sendai plain in the gejt tanaka and ogino 2017 in addition after reflection from the embankment occurs the driftwood could be transported to the seaward side therefore case v40me is recommended even considering the disadvantage when there is a space seaside case emv40 is optimal it has the advantage of reducing the fluid force on a coastal forest can reduce the destruction of the forest itself and can increase the mitigation effect by trapping driftwood tanaka and onai 2017 when there is available space but not enough both seaward and landward center vegetation type there is the option of increasing the vegetation length because the effectiveness changes with vegetation length and the stand structure of trees it should be clarified in general by numerical simulations like those of tanaka et al 2017 which include the destruction modes of coastal trees this study investigated three vegetation lengths 40 60 and 80 rows this study modelled 40 cm diameter trees on a real scale according to the actual pine tree breakage in the 2011 gejt tanaka et al 2013 the 40 cm diameter tree is assumed not to be broken when h 1 23 however the trend suggested that some of the trees especially on the seaward side of vegetation may be overturned when h 1 58 even in that case igarashi and tanaka 2018 demonstrated that as few as two rows of vegetation can increase the reflection when the vegetation was set on the seaward side of the embankment even when the trees are overturned they increase the reflection after the reflection from the embankment had started in the optimal seaward vegetation type case v40me the forest length should be discussed in more detail including the two destruction modes overturning driftwood is not produced and tree trunk breakage driftwood is produced at gejt much erosion behind the embankment occurred tappin et al 2012 tanaka and sato 2015 case mev40 has a possibility to produce driftwood by accelerating the downward flow from the embankment in order to suppress the production of driftwood case emv40 is more suitable than case mev40 for the landward vegetation in addition this study selected the same sizes for a moat and an embankment although the tsunami mitigation effect of a moat was confirmed in this study when it was located on the seaward side of an embankment its effect was not high due to the re reflection from the seaward slope there is a possibility of increasing the tsunami mitigation effects by changing the shape and volume of the moat in the future studies on the size and shape of the moat are needed to demonstrate its effect 5 summary and conclusions the conclusions derived from this study are listed below a hybrid defense system in the order of vegetation a moat and an embankment from the seaward side case v40me showed the highest reduction in overflow volume and in delaying the tsunami wave in case v40me the effect of the moat itself was estimated to be low however the overflow volume from an embankment may be decreased because a re reflected wave to the landward side is created by the seaward slope of the moat the shape of the moat affects the reduction of overflow volume and tsunami delay and therefore this should be discussed in a future study the reduction of the fluid force index in case v40me was highest when h was small on the other hand case v80 had the highest reduction in fluid force index when h was high this is because the reflection effect by the embankment is weak when the flow is deep the hybrid system in the order of vegetation an embankment and a moat from the seaside case v40em had higher a reduction effect of the fluid force index than that of case v40me in high h conditions because the moat located landward of the embankment case v40em decreased the overtopping flow velocity from the embankment with increasing h the fluid force index was suppressed however since this case had a higher water level at the inland side than case v40me in high h conditions the reduction rate of the moment index for case v40em was lower than for case v40me four indices are proposed for evaluating the total advantage the analysis clearly shows that case v40me had the greatest advantage when there was space available landward of an existing forest for utilizing the seaward space of an existing forest case emv40 was found to be the best when there was limited space on both sides of an existing forest the advantage of the hybrid system declines but there is an option of increasing the forest length itself acknowledgements this study was partly funded by a jsps grant in
