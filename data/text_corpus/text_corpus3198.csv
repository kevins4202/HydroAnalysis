15990,implementation of water safety planning methods globally has focused primarily on developing an evidence base to demonstrate the benefits of the wsp methodology for risk management in water systems however little work has been completed to understand the appropriateness of the risk matrix method currently used to capture levels of risk for system specific hazardous events this study examines two quantitative risk calculations probability density functions and event trees compared to the risk matrix method employed in water safety planning this analysis was undertaken to understand if the risk matrix provides an accurate estimation of risk in a water system two data sets were collected from nine water supply systems both continuous inline monitoring and grab samples collected in water distribution systems discrete events for chlorine residual data using quantitative risk calculations our study found the risk matrix does not accurately estimate risk compared to water quality data from a water system in thirty four 77 of the forty four possible scenarios investigated the risk matrix method provided an underestimation or overestimation compared to the probability calculated using water quality data the probabilities calculated using continuous data and the event tree method provided the closest estimations to the risk matrix indicating larger data sets with simpler methods may be more likely to match wsp results the lack of accuracy obtained reveals the need for a re evaluation of the risk matrix within a water safety plan wsp particularly for systems with data available to perform advanced risk analysis the risk matrix method has been used historically for systems with little data however for water systems with advanced water quality monitoring adding quantitative probability calculations to a water safety plan has the potential to increase accuracy of risk assessment in water safety planning keywords risk assessment risk matrices water quality data water safety plans 1 introduction the world health organization who has promoted the water safety plan wsp approach to managing and assessing risk in water supply systems since 2004 bartram et al 2009 who 2012 who 2016 the wsp manual developed to guide implementation and creation of wsps promotes the use of a risk matrix approach to evaluate the risk level associated with an identified hazard in a water system bartram et al 2009 a risk matrix is a semi quantitative tool used to understand risk using a scoring regime to determine whether a risk is low moderate or high risk a risk matrix calculates risk by multiplying a likelihood score by a consequence or severity score to obtain a risk score the risk score is then used to specify which scores are considered low moderate or high risk bartram et al 2009 who 2012 while a risk matrix has been shown to work well in situations where data is scarce or unavailable cox jr 2008 bartram et al 2009 who 2012 there are drawbacks associated with accuracy of the probability and impact estimations a risk matrix approach is subjective relying on a person s ability to understand probability and impact descriptions of likelihood and consequence levels differ not only between industries but within different jurisdictions in the water sector who 2012 bartram et al 2009 hokstad et al 2009 ausaid and sopac 2010 thompson and majam 2009 as an example unlikely is defined as once in a year in wsp documentation bartram et al 2009 hokstad et al 2009 thompson and majam 2009 however unlikely is also defined as occurring with a frequency of less than one incident monthly in specific case studies in australia alberta and the us where an incident refers to a data point falling outside the optimal operational parameters ausaid and sopac 2010 the environmental protection agency epa office of environmental enforcement 2011 aesrd 2011 the variations in definitions of likelihood led to difficulty comparing the frequency of occurrence of events across jurisdictions making it difficult to draw conclusions about the efficacy of the wsp approach globally currently the who promotes three different forms of risk assessment for water supply systems 1 a sanitary inspection or survey 2 a risk matrix approach and 3 a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra who 2016 the data input necessary for each method increases in both complexity and volume of data from sanitary surveys to qmras as previously discussed the risk matrix approach is considered semi quantitative by the who who 2012 for the purpose of this study we consider the risk matrix a qualitative method due to its subjective nature we examined documentation for the qmra approach to determine which types of quantitative data are commonly used in qmra as a starting point to identify quantitative data to compare to the risk matrix approach a review of the who guidance documentation of qmra methods who 2016 revealed that while quantitative models are used to determine the risk of infection by or presence of micro organisms in a water system there is little emphasis placed on other water quality parameters collected in a water system such as chlorine residual temperature ph and turbidity these parameters are often easier to collect than microbial parameters due to the wealth of field equipment available proven laboratory methods and the ease with which a large sample size can be taken who 2016 microbial data needed for a qmra is very specific and a large volume is needed to complete a full scale qmra howard et al 2006 who 2016 as a result we focused our analysis on easily measurable parameters in small water supply systems corresponding to hazards related to chlorine disinfection as there was a wealth of chlorine residual data available from the water systems included in this study quantitative calculations using water quality parameters such as chlorine residual provide a potential avenue to improve how risk matrices are constructed and used in water systems we hypothesize that risk matrix likelihood definitions informed by quantitative data from a water system are more likely to accurately assess risk in water systems definitions of likelihood that are arbitrary for example unlikely defined as less than once a month may not align with the actual probability of occurrence based on data which may be closer to less than once a year for example if risk matrix likelihood values are constructed using actual data from a water system we hypothesize that the risk matrix may more accurately reflect a water system s risks because it is driven by data from the water system data in many water systems is only used to ensure compliance to regulatory requirements we propose using the same data comprehensively over time to adapt the definitions of likelihood in a risk matrix to reflect capacity of the system however quantitative calculations are often unreliable in a system with sparse data sets with sampling programs dictated by regulatory guidelines who 2012 who 2016 compared to a qualitative risk matrix which allows any system to characterize risk regardless of data availability qualitative risk also describes more types of hazardous situations related to maintenance and operations that quantitative calculations cannot capture who 2012 bartram et al 2009 it is therefore important to recognize that quantitative calculations are not meant as a replacement of the risk matrix approach but as a new method to construct risk matrix likelihood definitions in high income countries or advanced water supply systems monitoring systems that generate a high volume of data are often already in place and stronger incentives to adopt a wsp approach are needed due to the prevalence of strong regulatory environments and robust monitoring systems summerill et al 2010 amjad et al 2016 baum et al 2015 baum and bartram 2017 the purpose of comparing risk analysis methods in this study was therefore to determine whether data currently being collected in a water system can provide a meaningful metic to calculate likelihood of occurrence or a new way to redefine how we generate likelihood descriptions in risk matrices a review of several possible risk analysis techniques was completed in 2009 by techneau detailing possible applications of risk analysis using water quality data from simple to complex hokstad et al 2009 however little evidence or literature exists suggesting these methods have been tested in countries where wsps are established or where implementation studies are being completed smeets et al 2011 demonstrated that there are different applications for quantitative water quality data in a wsp but largely focused on microbial data and the qmra approach in their study turbidity temperature and chlorine data were used to augment microbial data but the probability of being outside an optimal operating range was not calculated for these additional parameters nor were risk analysis calculations used to quantify probability of occurrence smeets et al 2011 the objective of this study was to explore how traditional risk analysis calculations such as probability density functions event trees etc of quantitative probability of failure compare to the results of the risk matrix method by comparing current likelihood definitions to calculated probabilities we can understand whether qualitative definitions align with actual data this tells us if the risk matrix is constructed in a way that reflects the risks in the actual system therefore this study examines two critical questions 1 do risk matrix definitions of likelihood align with the probability found from a quantitative probability calculation and 2 what does this imply for the construction of risk matrices risk matrices are recommended for small or underserved systems that do not have a large volume of water quality data however the small water systems used in this study do have sufficient data to justify quantitative calculations of probability this study compares quantitative probabilities calculated by using probability density functions and event trees to a probability obtained using definitions of likelihood and therefore probability in the risk matrix method the goal was to understand whether the risk matrix method is over or underestimating the likelihood of a hazardous event compared to water quality data for the purpose of this study calculations from water quality data were considered correct thus comparison presented in this study are presented with the assumption that the probability of occurrence from water quality data is better representative of actual system likelihood than the likelihood obtained from a risk matrix based on this analysis recommendations were made for the use of probability calculations in water safety plans and in the construction of risk matrices 2 methods 2 1 determining risk matrix probabilities for comparison to translate the risk matrix scores to probabilities descriptions of likelihood scores were evaluated from literature wsp risk matrices are designed such that the likelihood is equal to the probability of occurrence of an event most commonly an event where there is an inadequacy in the water treatment system or a failure to meet regulatory compliance values each likelihood level is described as 1 event in a month or 1 event in a year etc using these descriptions it was possible to obtain a probability for each likelihood description consequence or impact was not considered this study is focused on understanding the comparability of probabilities there are several ways to quantify consequence also termed severity or impact but choosing a specific method here for comparability was beyond the scope of this study likelihood descriptions from eight jurisdictions and case studies bartram et al 2009 hokstad et al 2009 the environmental protection agency epa office of environmental enforcement 2011 gunnarsdottir et al 2012 aesrd 2011 ausaid and sopac 2010 hokstad et al 2009 thompson and majam 2009 were considered to choose a range of probabilities for each likelihood level the range of probabilities are presented in table 1 a which outlines how likelihood descriptions were translated to probabilities for the purposes of this study in table 1a one occurrence represents one sample taken on one day where the chlorine residual is inadequate a previous study evaluated risk for a suite of hazardous events related to chlorine disinfection using a conditionally formated risk assessment questionnaire lane et al 2021 scores for likelihood 1 9 as presented in table 1 consequence and overall risk were recorded with this questionnaire for 22 different hazardous events including a hazard related to inadequate chlorine residual likelihood scores were extracted from the questionnaire for this specific hazardous event from these water systems for use in this study to compare likelihood score to quantitative probability of occurrence using table 1 table 1 presents the probability of occurrence as a value between 0 and 1 subsequent results present the same probability as a percentage between 0 and 100 based on likelihood descriptions and calculated probabilities each possible risk score from a risk matrix was assigned a probability for comparison to the quantitative probabilities of occurrence used in this study the calculated probabilities are presented with the assumption that an event or occurrence corresponds to one data point per day in table 1 the qualitative probability column is used for illustrative purposes only to show how likelihood values are described in literature these likelihood descriptions only apply to the scenario where an event is defined as one sample per day in this study probabilities were calculated by assuming one event corresponded to one day or to a daily sample taken in a water treatment facility thus if the likelihood description is once a week there are seven possible days on which the one event could occur or 1 7 0 143 the denominator to calculate the calculated probability in table 1a is therefore the number of possible days in the time frame laid out in the qualitative probability column of table 1a 2 2 quantitative probability calculations 2 2 1 probability density functions probability density functions pdfs and a simple event tree method were selected as two important risk calculations to consider for comparison to risk matrices the pdf method was chosen for its ubiquity in risk analysis literature and is a proven method for finding probabilities of occurrence based on different bounding criteria mcbean 2019b since chlorine residual data were always a positive number non negative distributions were fit to the data four potential distributions were chosen lognormal exponential weibull and gamma data was initially reviewed using a probability probability plot to visually determine which distribution best fit the data after initial review of the data the exponential distribution was removed visually using probability probability plots and empirical cumulative distribution functions the exponential distribution was not a good fit for the data and did not provide accurate calculations of probability an example probability probability plot is provided in the supplemental information figure s1 several goodness of fit tests were utilized and the akaike information criterion aic was selected the aic compares the relative fit of a distribution to the other chosen distributions hu 2007 the anderson darling test and the chi squared test were also used to conduct best fit tests for comparison to the aic results and the outcomes were similar to the aic test the formula for the aic test is presented in eq 1 in eq 1 k represents the number of estimated parameters in the model and l represents the maximum value of the likelihood function of the model hu 2007 the aic calculation was completed using the r software language and the base code function for aic with the assumption k 2 eq 1 a i c 2 k 2 ln l 2 2 2 event trees the event tree method was developed using models presented by techneau hokstad et al 2009 which combined fault trees and event trees to describe the overall risk in a system the event tree is used as a visual method of separating types of samples and finding the probability of each critical control point by dividing by the total sample probability hokstad et al 2009 event trees were constructed for chlorine residual data and critical control points were used to determine the bifurcation of branches in the event tree for example according to the guidelines for canadian drinking water quality gcdwq health canada 2019 chlorine residual must have a minimum value of 0 2 mg l to provide adequate disinfection data sets were evaluated using the event tree to determine if samples failed to meet this minimum the event tree was constructed for both sample collection frequency and regulatory guidelines enabled determination of how data availability influenced the probability of occurrence the chlorine residual event tree is shown in fig 1 the event tree for chlorine residual examines three factors if a sample was taken on a given day whether the sample was above 0 2 mg l and if the sample was above 0 4 mg l the 0 2 mg l threshold represents low chlorine as defined by national water quality guidelines serving as an indicator of inadequate disinfection this represents a high risk scenario in a wsp risk matrix the 0 4 mg l threshold was chosen as a near miss situation to determine how many samples were close to being below the 0 2 mg l threshold but were not yet considered high risk this represents a moderate risk scenario in a wsp risk matrix there are therefore three identified situations where samples can feasibly fall in the event tree ideal sampling near miss and low chlorine situations marked cannot occur are not physically possible but are included to provide a complete event tree event tree probabilities were calculated by dividing the number of samples matching the given criteria by the total number of samples probabilities are calculated at each node for example sample taken adequate chlorine the calculations for probability are shown in terms of variable values in fig 2 2 3 data collection and analysis to present comparisons of risk matrix probabilities to water quality data in this study the probability of occurrence is considered an accurate estimation of risk in the water system therefore an underestimation of risk represents a scenario in which the water quality data generates a probability of occurrence that is greater than the probability obtained from the risk matrix method an overestimation represents a situation in which the probability generated from data is less than the probability from the risk matrix an accurate estimation is one where the probability of occurrence from water quality data falls within the range of risk matrix probabilities in table 1 these conventions will be used throughout this paper for clarity chlorine residual data was collected from nine small water systems in nova scotia and new brunswick in 2017 table s1 each water system serves less than 500 people with the exception of system g which serves more than 1000 people and systems h and i which serve between 500 and 1000 people systems a g are owned and operated by municipal water utilities while systems h and i are owned and operated by first nations communities systems h and i do not currently have scada systems in place and have no other current method of collecting continuous data in their system therefore we used grab samples of chlorine residual for both the continuous and discrete data sets shown in table 2 at the time data was collected from system g no grab samples were available 2 3 1 qualitative data data for the nine water systems was generated in a previous study a questionnaire to identify hazards associated with chlorination was conducted in each system which generated a risk score for 22 different hazardous events lane et al 2021 permission to use water quality data from the two first nation systems included in this study was secured from the water system operators in each community our partner organization the atlantic policy congress of first nations chiefs apcfnc and the use of this data complies with the ocap principles first nations information governance centre 2020 lane et al used the risk score associated with a single hazardous event inadequate chlorine residual that was evaluated using the risk assessment questionnaire the probability in the questionnaire contained verbal probability descriptors such as rarely and occasionally the risk score for the inadequate chlorine residual hazardous event was translated to a probability of occurrence using table 1 2 3 2 quantitative data two different types of data were requested from the water systems that contributed to this study supervisory control and data acquisition scada data representing a large sample size with consistent sampling frequency and grab sampling data samples collected periodically although not always consistently and in a smaller volume water quality data was used to calculated probability of occurrence using the event tree calculation for both grab samples discrete data and scada continuous data to determine if there was a difference in the effectiveness of the event tree method based on data type pdfs were fitted to both data types and a best fit test was conducted using the aic the results were then compared to the probabilities obtained using table 1 inadequate chlorine residual was chosen as the hazardous event since concerns with chlorination are well documented and chlorine residual data is required by water quality guidelines health canada 2019 2 3 3 filling data gaps not every water system had complete data sets available to make accurate estimations of qualitative versus quantitative risk in the case where there is an asterisk located after the estimation in the following tables this result was estimated using assumptions of probability of risk based on table 1 if water safety plan risk matrix results were not available risk was assumed to be moderate risk and a probability of 0 03225 was used as the risk matrix qualitative probability in the case of scada data missing from a water system the probability of occurrence was assumed to be one in one thousand events or 0 1 for both the probability density function and event tree methods if grab samples were missing 0 1 probability of occurrence was assumed for the probability density function and 1 0 was assumed for the event tree method since the probability density function more often identifies the probability of occurrence as a relatively small percentage these numbers were chosen to avoid underestimating risk in cases where data was unavailable 2 4 sensitivity analysis 2 4 1 defining an event or occurrence defining an event as one occurrence per day provides a narrow comparison of the risk matrix probabilities to calculated probabilities therefore we have included a simple sensitivity analysis to examine how the definition of an event impacts the comparison in table 1 we have defined four different definitions of an event the original definition of an event implies that we have one sample per day and we evaluate that sample using the criteria for chlorine residual each day the probability of occurrence is based on one sample per day however depending on the type of water treatment system samples may be taken more frequently than once per day or less frequently than once per day depending on both the capacity of the treatment facility and the reporting requirements for regulatory compliance in our sensitivity analysis we have included two definitions of an event that correspond to an increase in sampling frequency sampling once per hour or every ten minutes as could occur with an advanced scada system and two definitions of an event that correspond to a decrease in sampling frequency sampling once per week or once per month of the water systems evaluated in this study table 2 we know that systems a f have the capacity to monitoring chlorine residual either hourly or every ten minutes informing the values for increased monitoring frequency in systems h and i in the past chlorine residual samples were only taken weekly or even monthly informing the values for decreased monitoring frequency when defining an event we did not change the likelihood descriptions provided from the risk matrix approach only the calculated probability values in table 1 in table 1b the sensitivity probability values in the four rightmost columns were calculated by changing the denominator of the calculation for example where an event was defined as one sample per week an occurrence of 1 in one month was found by dividing one by 4 weeks per month which equals 0 25 if the event was defined as one sample every hour then an occurrence of one in one day was found by dividing one by 24 which equals 0 042 after each scenario was defined we re evaluated our comparisons between the risk matrix probability and the calculated probabilities to determine if the risk matrix underestimates overestimates or is an accurate estimation of the likelihood of occurrence 2 4 2 constructing different risk matrices in this analysis we examine what the risk level associated with a calculated probability is based on different likelihood definitions using the pdf and event tree probabilities calculated above a water system could determine the likelihood of occurrence in a risk matrix each likelihood description implies a range of values for example 10 3 to 10 4 indicates moderate risk if the calculated probability of occurrence falls within this range then the water system can say that there is a moderate risk of inadequate chlorine driven by data the range of likelihood values depends on how the risk matrix is designed thus in this analysis we examine five different likelihood scenarios and determine the risk level associated with each water system based on the calculated probabilities this analysis attempts to examine how a water system can use a calculated probability of occurrence in tandem of with a risk matrix by 1 calculating the probability of having inadequate chlorine and 2 using that value to determine whether that likelihood falls into the low moderate or high risk categories in a risk matrix for this analysis we assumed the likelihood descriptors rare unlikely etc would remain the same and that the same nine risk levels would be present in the risk matrix and sought to understand how defining different frequencies of occurrence would change the results from the risk matrix for example if high risk ranges from 1 in 10 probability of 10 2 to 1 in 100 probability of 10 3 when an event is defined as one day how does this compare to an event defined as one week in the sensitivity analysis we examine how changing the event definition potentially changes the risk level assigned to an event by a risk matrix if the risk matrix is informed by data for example if the probability of occurrence is calculated as 1 in 10 000 which risk level does this correspond to in a risk matrix if the event is defined in one of the five ways presented in this study risk matrix data for the comparison component of this study relies on data from lane et al 2021 risk matrix data for the sensitivity analysis is hypothetical our initial comparison analysis therefore only examines the scenario where the risk matrix was constructed with the assumption that an event is one inadequate chlorine residual sample taken per day table 1a with risk matrix likelihood values coming from lane et al 2021 in our sensitivity analysis we then look at how changing the definition of an event changes the range of probability values associated with each likelihood bin in the risk matrix table 1b fig 2 shows these likelihood bins as a range of values for example 1 in 100 to 1 in 1000 events fig 2 shows the risk level boundaries change bins as the definition of an event changes we compared the calculated probability by either the pdf method or the event tree method to these new risk matrix definitions of likelihood to see how the risk level changed based on how the risk matrix was constructed the calculated probability from either the pdf or event tree method was evaluated to determine which likelihood bin the value corresponded to from the bin we then used table 1b to determine the risk level associated with each risk matrix 3 results 3 1 comparative analysis 3 1 1 probability density functions chlorine data sample sizes ranged from 107 samples to over eight million samples collected from scada data continuous sampling over the course of one year of data acquisition in system h and system i there was no automated data collection system and written daily logbook data was substituted for scada data for the probability density function calculation the akaike information criteria aic revealed the relative best fit for seven of the nine systems was the gamma distribution the second best fit distribution was also considered for the larger data sets and the lognormal distribution provides the second best fit in five of the nine communities the only system that did not have the gamma distribution as the best or second best fit was system d which had the largest data set at over eight million data points similar results were observed for grab sample data using probability density functions gamma provides the most accurate estimation most of the time table 3 shows the best fit and second best fit distributions for both continuous and discrete data for each water system for the majority of the system less than 1 in 1000 000 chlorine residual samples were less than the threshold of 0 2 mg l in table 3 this is shown as a percent which translates the 10 7 probability value 1 in 1000 000 samples to a percent 10 5 table 4 shows the probabilities obtained using the best fit probability density function for each system with both discrete and continuous data the column labeled qualitative level contains data extracted from lane et al 2021 for each water system and the column labeled qualitative probability presents the range of values corresponding to the qualitative level from table 1a due to the presence of several low risk hazardous events the majority of systems had a qualitative probability from the risk matrix conversion using table 1 in the range of 0 0548 0 00273 table 4 shows qualitative probability from the wsp risk matrix method in comparison to quantitative probability from the pdf as percentages the qualitative vs quantitative column in table 4 indicates whether the qualitative estimation is an overestimation underestimation or accurate estimation compared to the quantitative probability calculated using the pdf method overestimation represents a situation where the risk matrix probability is larger than the calculated probability underestimation occurs when the risk matrix probability is smaller than the calculated probability and accurate estimation occurs when the calculated probabilities fall in the range specified by the risk matrix results for both continuous and discrete data sets are presented in table 4 table 4 establishes the risk matrix method most often overestimates the probability of occurrence of low chlorine 0 2 mg l the probability calculated with a risk matrix is greater than the pdf method in 9 of 11 scenarios 82 system h and system i both have two possible hazardous events for chlorine one for the chlorine residual in the distribution system and one for the chlorine residual in storage in a treatment facility system h is the only system where the risk matrix underestimates or accurately estimates the quantitative probability of occurrence the prevalence of overestimation indicates the probability of occurrence of low chlorine residual is small in practice when compared to a risk matrix evaluation which is based on operator expertise but limited by the design of the risk matrix where scada data is used to calculate probability for grab samples a similar trend exists for pdf calculations with overestimation occurring in 82 of scenarios overestimation occurs in eight of eleven scenarios underestimation occurs in one scenario and there is one scenario where there was an accurate estimation of risk the case where the pdf method with grab samples matched the risk matrix probability range was the only case where a moderate risk level was identified in system h without additional water systems to evaluate it is difficult to determine if this is unique to system h or if hazards identified as moderate or high level risk are more often accurate compared to probability of occurrence 3 1 2 event tree method using event trees to calculate probability generated different results compared to the pdf method first where grab samples were evaluated with the event tree method there was more underestimation and accurate estimation than observed when using the pdf method in fact the risk matrix method does not overestimate the probability of occurrence with grab samples in the event tree table 4 shows that for seven of eleven cases 64 the risk matrix qualitative estimation was an underestimation of the risk observed using the event tree to calculate probability and was accurate in the remaining four cases this is markedly different than the pdf method which generally overestimated the actual risk in a system as calculated from water quality data results for the event tree method for both continuous and discrete data are presented in table 5 for the event tree method more data provided a more accurate estimation of the probability of occurrence six of the possible scenarios proved an accurate estimation of risk using the risk matrix only one scenario was an overestimation and the remaining scenarios were underestimations of risk this result indicates that the risk matrix method probabilities most closely align with the probabilities generated from the event tree method with a large data set 3 1 3 comparing analysis methods and data sets overall the risk matrix method provides the most accurate estimations of risk when compared to event tree method using continuous data scada the event tree method with discrete data grab samples results in the risk matrix predominantly underestimating risk and shows no indication of a biased estimation compared to the pdf method with discrete data the risk matrix overestimated risk in 9 of 11 cases compared to calculations from the pdf method using continuous data when comparing qualitatively obtained probabilities to those found from water quality data there are few cases ten cases out of 44 possible combinations 23 of data size and probability of occurrence calculation where the probabilities are of the same order of magnitude the risk matrix method most closely aligns with the probabilities calculated using the event tree and continuous data however only seven water systems were involved in this analysis and more water system data sets are needed to confirm this conclusion to better visualize the results figure 3 presents a probability probability plot comparing the risk matrix qualitative probability wsp risk matrix to quantitative risk as calculated by either of the event tree or pdf the y x line represents accuracy a point on or relatively close to this line indicates that quantitative and qualitative probabilities are approximately the same a point above this line represents an overestimation of risk since the qualitative risk is greater than the quantitative risk a point below this line represents an underestimation of risk since the qualitative risk is less than the quantitative risk the color of the point represents how far away from the y x line a point is in figure 3 there are only four cases where the risk obtained from the qualitative calculation is an accurate estimation of the quantitative risk in a system as calculated by using water quality data there are 4 cases of overestimation and 4 cases of underestimation presented on this plot this result demonstrates the subjectively of the risk matrix method which is highly susceptible to the knowledge of the person utilizing the risk matrix there is no clear indication whether the risk matrix tends to predominantly overestimate or underestimate the probability obtained from a pdf or event tree as accuracy occurs at the same frequency as over or underestimation the probability obtained using the wsp risk matrix method was determined using a questionnaire containing verbal probability descriptors such as rarely and occasionally verbal expressions of probability are often subjective and determinant of the stakeholder evaluating risk kolodziej et al 2017 thus the risk matrix method is highly variable depending upon stakeholder interpretation of likelihood definitions one stakeholder may interpret unlikely as an event that occurs once in a year while another may interpret unlikely as once in ten years leading to different resulting risk scores with the risk matrix method the lack of accuracy from the risk matrix when compared to pdf and event tree probabilities suggests that changes need to be made to the risk matrix method potential changes could include redefining and standardizing likelihood definitions in a risk matrix or considering the addition of water quality data to the water safety planning to more accurately express probability of occurrence 3 2 sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 changing the definition of an event after changing the definition of an event we ran the comparative analysis again with new qualitative probability ranges as shown in table 1b the results in this section focus on how the comparative analysis changes with the changing definition of an event only using the pdf method to calculate probability when the sampling frequency decreased an event every week or every month the risk matrix is more likely to overestimate risk the converse is also true when sampling frequency increased an event every hour or every ten minutes the risk matrix was more likely to underestimate or accurately estimate likelihood compared to the pdf table 6 shows the results of each scenario using the pdf calculation only when sampling frequency was decreased to every month 91 of the 22 scenarios water system plus data type resulted in the risk matrix overestimating risk when sampling frequency was decreased to every week 82 of the scenarios resulted in an overestimation using the event tree method we saw similar changes in estimations table s2 as sampling frequency increased the risk matrix was more likely to underestimate risk as sampling frequency decreased the risk matrix was more likely to overestimate or accurately estimate risk when sampling frequency was increased to every ten minutes 100 of the scenarios were underestimated by the risk matrix when sampling frequency was increased to every hour 95 of the scenarios were underestimated by the risk matrix these results from both the event tree and pdf methods indicate that the risk matrix estimations are sensitive to how the risk matrix likelihood values are defined since the likelihood values are defined by sample availability we can see that as more data is available samples every 10 min or when less data is available samples every month there is a greater tendency to incorrectly estimate risk using a risk matrix approach the initial comparison made the assumption that the calculated probability was based on an event defined as one sample per day for ease of comparison across the nine water systems however in practice systems a f there is capacity to sample every hour or every ten minutes because these systems have advanced scada systems in systems b f using the pdf method to calculate the probability of occurrence the risk matrix consistently overestimates the likelihood of inadequate chlorine if an event is defined as once every hour or once every ten minutes using the event tree method the risk matrix consistently underestimates the likelihood of inadequate chlorine only in system a using the pdf calculation and a event defined as every ten minutes does the risk matrix accurately estimate the likelihood of inadequate chlorine in systems h and i historically samples for chlorine residual were only taken weekly or even monthly if the pdf method is used to calculate probability of occurrence the risk matrix overestimates likelihood of inadequate chlorine for an event occurring once per week however if the event tree is used to calculate probability of occurrence the risk matrix is relatively accurate for the continuous data set and an event occurring once per week the difference between the definition of an event serve to further highlight the importance of defining likelihood in a risk matrix 3 2 2 evaluating different risk matrix constructions while the comparative sensitivity analysis above is based on risk matrix data from a previous study the analysis in this section focuses on hypothetical scenarios by calculating a probability of occurrence using either the pdf or event tree method we now know the likelihood of an event this analysis takes those calculated probabilities of occurrence and uses them to evaluate the risk level in each water system under different definitions of an event and therefore different likelihoods of occurrence table 7 presents the results from this analysis for probabilities calculated using the event tree method and table s3 presents results for probabilities calculated using the probability density function method as an example in system f the probability of occurrence of inadequate chlorine is 1 15 or 1 in 100 10 2 to 1 in 1000 10 3 when an event is defined as once every ten minutes this probability of occurrence falls into the high risk level however when an event is defined as once every hour the probability of occurrence falls into the moderate risk level if an event is defined as once a day once a week or once a month the risk level is low this simple example illustrates how the definition of likelihood values in a risk matrix is critical if a water system has sufficient data to calculate a probability of occurrence the water system still needs to make a judgement about the magnitude of that probability risk matrices have typically been employed to categorize levels of likelihood and risk and still have utility in this application however our results indicate that how likelihood is defined is critical to proper application 4 discussion 4 1 risk matrices do not align with actual probabilities of occurrence our comparison study revealed how often a risk matrix tends to overestimate probability of occurrence in a water system compared to probabilities calculated using water quality data several previous studies of small systems conclude more data collection is needed to make more accurate predictions of risk butterfield and camper 2004 kot et al 2011 schuster et al 2005 however using continuous data in a probability density function method for determining probability of occurrence demonstrated this is not the case the continuous data set was comprised of samples collected every hour this was chosen to decrease serial dependency in the data set but still provide a sufficiently large data set to analyze however it is possible that there is still a large degree of serial dependency in the data set that could have impacted the fitted distribution mean standard deviation and shape or scale for gamma and weibull distributions mcbean 2019c the probabilities obtained with the probability density function method were less than 1 with the exception of system h and the risk matrix method was an overestimation in all but 2 scenarios for continuous data the more samples that were collected using continuous data the smaller the probability of occurrence from a pdf became indicating that more data may lead to a false sense of security derived from this smaller probability of occurrence a failure of the chlorination system may occur regardless of past data a small probability of occurrence does not guarantee future hazardous events are unlikely in addition accuracy between the risk matrix and quantitative probabilities most often occurs with a large data set scada data and the event tree method this result is consistent with examination of risk assessment strategies for water system as performed by techneau in 2008 hokstad et al 2009 simpler methods were found to be more appropriate for most water systems particularly for small water systems without automated data collection hokstad et al 2009 however the majority of municipal systems in this study are considered small systems by atlantic canadian waterworks association standards acwwa 2004 these municipal systems had sufficient data to complete quantitative risk assessment calculations however in the wsp manuals for small systems the risk matrix method is used specifically due to concerns with adequate data collection who 2012 the who small systems manual defines a small system as a system that experience issues as a result of limited access to resources to resolve these issues who 2012 therefore our study adds to the body of literature suggesting population is not the best definition of a small system as the small municipal systems in this study did have strong data collection procedures and small populations serviced by the water system but experience issues larger municipal systems do not the results presented for the water systems in this study provide a limited representation of how quantitative data can augment a wsp focus was placed on chlorine disinfection hazards and only 2 of the possible 22 hazards from the risk assessment questionnaire lane et al 2021 were used for comparison to quantitative data having data to support a similar comparison for other hazards such as high turbidity absence of maintenance records and incorrect chlorine dose calculations would improve future studies in addition six of seven of the water systems involved in this study had low risk identified for the hazardous event with only one community system h having a moderate risk hazardous event the predominance of low risk hazardous events needs to be considered in the interpretation of our results small probabilities are often more difficult to quantify and convey to stakeholders kolodzieg et al 2017 in a water system which may account for the lack of accuracy observed as a result it is currently unknown whether the probability density function method and event tree method would provide the same results if the hazardous events had been identified as moderate level or high level risk and thereby have a higher probability of occurrence based on table 1 this study is able to confirm that low risk hazardous events have smaller quantitative probabilities but cannot verify if the conclusions made about each method and data set are valid for higher risk situations 4 2 interpretation of small probabilities by water system stakeholders one of the primary concerns with the small probability values generated by the pdf and event tree methods 10 5 is the interpretation of these small values by water system stakeholders literature suggests the majority of people who have no or limited experience with risk assessment cannot accurately process or properly understand small probabilities less than 1 tyszka and sawicki 2011 idzikowska et al 2017 furthermore depending on the amount of information available about probabilities and risks people have different perceptions of how risky a low probability but high impact event actually is michailova et al 2017 idzikowska et al 2017 tyszka and sawicki 2011 tyszka and zielonka 2017 small probabilities represented as numeric values are difficult for people to understand and the method of risk communication greatly impacts a stakeholder s understanding of a risky situation michailova et al 2017 kolodzieg et al 2017 visschers et al 2008 in the context of this study the probabilities generated by the pdf method are less than 1 e 10 in five of eleven scenarios for scada data sets and less that 1 0 in nine of eleven scenarios this translates to event with extremely rare or never likelihood from a risk matrix however events that have never occurred in water systems can occur in future situations jalba and hrudey 2006 and the small probabilities observed in this study provide information that can lead to the misconstrued assumption of safe water quality according to tyszka and zielonka this result is termed unrealistic optimism the underestimating of the likelihood of negative events and the overestimating of the likelihood of positive events tyszka and zielonka 2017 the wsp approach promotes interaction with multiple stakeholders in a water system to best describe risk bartram et al 2009 who 2012 however research has shown that decisions made from experience and descriptions of hazardous situations tend to underestimate risk tyszka and zielonka 2017 a study of the alberta drinking water safety plan in 2014 showed stakeholders tend to rate risks as low or moderate risk because high risk indicated a stakeholder was not completing his or her job drachenberg 2014 given that 15 of 44 scenarios examined in this study were underestimations of risk in a water system and ten scenarios were accurate stakeholder knowledge alone does not provide consistent or accurate understanding of hazardous event likelihood in water systems other studies of probability perception have indicated people care more about the impact of a risky situation than the probability of a situation michailova et al 2017 indicating consequence plays a critical role in risk evaluation and cannot be considered independent of likelihood this observation alludes to inherent bias in how risk assessment is performed in a wsp information about risk from water stakeholders needs to be properly balanced with calculations of probability to mitigate underestimation of likelihoods and more accurate measures of consequence need to be identified to address overall risk communication of the small probabilities observed in this study and translation of these values into likelihood values in a risk matrix is therefore critical several studies have been conducted to best understand how to present information about small probability high impact events to stakeholders kunreuther et al 2001 concluded that the best method for overcoming communication concerns is by providing comparisons kunreuther et al 2001 one possibility is a paling perspective scale a visual representation of probabilities in relation to probabilities of well known events or scenarios visschers et al 2008 the overall conclusion is that a reference point or contextual information is needed in for small probabilities to be comprehensible kunreuther et al 2001 visschers et al 2008 in general graphical representations of probabilities are easier to understand chua et al 2006 as cited by kolodziej et al 2017 pictographs function well in situations where low literacy or numeracy exists but are difficult to use with low probabilities visschers et al 2008 in the context of the water quality data evaluated in this study further research on how probability of occurrence can be accurately presented graphically or visually to stakeholders will be critical visschers et al 2008 found that verbal probabilities are often better to communicate probabilities to people but lack the technical accuracy to capture the entire hazardous scenario verbal probabilities are currently used in the wsp risk matrix method but are defined qualitatively instead of scaled numerically to better improve both likelihood descriptions in risk matrices probabilities obtained by using water quality data need to inform more accurate descriptions of probability to ground these terms in the reality experienced by the water systems stakeholders in water systems with advanced data collection calculations of probabilities can be used to define likelihood levels as a range of values defined specifically by the water system stakeholders to align with the wsp principle of community specificity bartram et al 2009 the verbal probabilities such as likely can be used to better communicate results to all stakeholders in a water system once these probabilities are grounded in verbal terms that reflect the data gathering capabilities of the water system 4 3 implications for water safety planning risk analysis 4 3 1 benefits of adding quantitative data to risk assessments previous studies of wsp implementation have shown that buy in to wsps as a risk management method can be challenging particularly where water system culture is focused on regulation summerill et al 2010a the addition of water quality data to the risk assessment component of water safety planning provides a new incentive for water system to adopt the wsp methodology additionally benefits of wsps were not always clear to water system stakeholders and the qualitative nature of the wsp method made it difficult for stakeholders to understand how this method could fit into the current water management culture summerill et al 2010a amjad et al 2016 the quantitative risk calculations utilized in this study provide a new avenue for integrating water quality data to a water safety plan that aligns more closely with a municipal stakeholder mindset the data driven culture found in the water systems studied previously is not unique summerill et al 2010a several other advanced water systems place focus on data collection to help meet requirements for regulatory compliance at a provincial level integrating water quality data into the structure of a risk matrix and the evaluation of likelihood of occurrence allows stakeholders to continue to sample for water quality parameters to meet regulations while also informing risk management quantitatively in the system through calculations of probability of occurrence for a more accurate wsp risk assessment using quantitative risk analysis fits nicely in regulatory based cultures and may be acceptable to many stakeholders as evidence of water safety plan utility for decision making scada and other continuous data sets are often used strictly for compliance or regulatory purposes and using this data productively in a wsp could incentivize wsp adoption in locations with highly regulated water systems quantitative methods are currently utilized in the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach who 2016 however the focus is placed on pathogenic organisms and microbial contaminants this study demonstrates the potential to include water quality parameters already collected in water systems such as chlorine residual to provide additional information about quantitative risk not previously captured by wsp risk matrices the methods presented in this study provide a bridge between the current risk matrix approach and the qmra the who promotes three levels of risk assessment sanitary surveys risk matrices and the qmra who 2016 studies of the qmra process in small systems have generated mixed results howard et al 2006 found that a qmra can be used in situation with limited data but point estimations at sampling locations in a distribution system do not necessarily capture the full range of disease exposure howard et al 2006 another study advocated for the use of water quality data where possible to strengthen the qmra approach as a single water quality parameter is unlikely to be appropriate across all water systems saxena et al 2015 these studies indicate there may be a benefit to adding quantitative probability calculations presented in this study and use of indicator parameters such as chlorine residual to aide water system evaluations of microbial contamination for water systems without capacity to collect the needed data for a qmra but enough monitoring data to necessitate a more sophisticated method than a risk matrix the pdf and event tree provide a logical first step for more rigorous risk evaluation in addition to integrating this approach into the continuum of risk assessments recommended by the who this method is adaptable to specific water system needs a requirement of the wsp methodology bartram et al 2009 who 2012 who 2016 for example 0 2 mg l of chlorine residual was chosen in the event tree method as this is the regulatory value specified by health canada health canada 2019 a near miss was defined as less than 0 4 mg l of chlorine residual however these values are specific to the water systems evaluated in this study and can be adapted to individual water systems as needed furthermore the probability density function method has the same characteristic the probability of occurrence or failure was calculated using the 0 2 mg l value as the criteria if a water system desired a higher threshold to serve as an advance warning of possible inadequate disinfection this is an easy adjustment with both methods examined in this study making pdfs and event trees more flexible than risk matrices compared to the risk matrix method this is an advantage the risk matrix method does not allow for multiple easy calculations of risk based on several different scenarios cox jr 2008 mcbean 2019a however with the addition of quantitative risk assessment calculations it is possible to model several hazardous scenarios to best adjust control measures and risk mitigation procedures in a water system 4 3 2 recommendations for risk matrix construction the sensitivity analysis conducted in this study highlights the importance of defining an event and associating that specific event with a probability of occurrence when an event was defined as one day high risk probabilities of occurrence range from one to 1 in 100 events when an event is defined as one hour the high risk probabilities of occurrence range from one to 1 in 1000 events if the calculated probability of occurrence using either the pdf or event tree method is 1 100 events in the first scenario the risk level will be high but will be moderate in the second scenario while this result is intuitively understood in the risk assessment community this study attempts to highlight the importance of risk matrix construction for the water industry where probabilities of occurrence are often very small in practice based on these results we recommend a water system examine the data available in their system and use this data to best construct a risk matrix applicable to their system the risk matrices found in literature who 2012 bartram et al 2009 hokstad et al 2009 ausaid and sopac 2010 thompson and majam 2009 the environmental protection agency epa office of environmental enforcement 2011 are based on arbitrary definitions of likelihood we recommend that a water system use actual water quality data to construct a risk matrix that is reasonable based on the sampling frequency for parameters such as chlorine residual turbidity and ph if calculated probabilities of occurrence in a system are so small that a risk matrix from literature always evaluated the risk as low the water system will consistently underestimate the risk of an event constructing a risk matrix based on data from the water system could be a key step to using water system data more productively to inform risk constructing the risk matrix based on data takes time and likely the input from a professional trained to specifically conduct risk assessments to remove some of the work training and calculating probabilities one possible solution would be to automate the process of calculating probabilities of occurrence based on water quality data with a software solution it is important that operators and managers of a water system understand why the risk matrix is constructed however the pdf and event tree calculations can be complicated to learn and may decrease a water system s ability to uptake such a rigorous method for constructing a risk matrix we recommend automating the calculations of probability using a coding language or software that reads in formated data from scada or excel log books and performs the calculations automatically in this software we recommend the water system has the ability to change the criteria associated with a specific water quality parameter for example less than 0 2 mg l of residual chlorine this method of risk matrix construction is aimed at creating better informed definitions of likelihood without the need to train operators and managers how to calculate probabilities of occurrence 5 conclusions while the risk matrix is ideal for situations where there is little water quality data available there are water systems that do not recognize the benefits of a wsp due to stringent data collection policies for regulatory compliance and also have a culture centered on water quality monitoring integrating quantitative risk analysis techniques into the wsps developed for water systems can provide another incentive for wsp adoption that did not exist previously one that aligns with water systems that are focuses on meeting regulations for compliance comparing the risk matrix method utilized in water safety planning to quantitative calculations of probability of occurrence revealed that the risk matrix approach is only comparable to probabilities calculated from water quality data 23 of the time 10 of 44 possible scenarios when the probability density function was used the risk matrix method tended to overestimate risk in a water system while risk matrices tended to underestimate risk compared to the event tree calculation the highest accuracy was seen where data sets were larger and the quantitative risk calculation was simpler expansion of this study to include other operational parameters such as ph and turbidity would provide additional evidence to support the conclusions presented here for chlorine residual quantitative calculations are not appropriate in all water systems particularly where data availability does not support calculations of probability of occurrence however where data is available the addition of quantitative calculations provides a more accurate picture of risk than the risk matrix method and provides another risk evaluation method for the wsp

15990,implementation of water safety planning methods globally has focused primarily on developing an evidence base to demonstrate the benefits of the wsp methodology for risk management in water systems however little work has been completed to understand the appropriateness of the risk matrix method currently used to capture levels of risk for system specific hazardous events this study examines two quantitative risk calculations probability density functions and event trees compared to the risk matrix method employed in water safety planning this analysis was undertaken to understand if the risk matrix provides an accurate estimation of risk in a water system two data sets were collected from nine water supply systems both continuous inline monitoring and grab samples collected in water distribution systems discrete events for chlorine residual data using quantitative risk calculations our study found the risk matrix does not accurately estimate risk compared to water quality data from a water system in thirty four 77 of the forty four possible scenarios investigated the risk matrix method provided an underestimation or overestimation compared to the probability calculated using water quality data the probabilities calculated using continuous data and the event tree method provided the closest estimations to the risk matrix indicating larger data sets with simpler methods may be more likely to match wsp results the lack of accuracy obtained reveals the need for a re evaluation of the risk matrix within a water safety plan wsp particularly for systems with data available to perform advanced risk analysis the risk matrix method has been used historically for systems with little data however for water systems with advanced water quality monitoring adding quantitative probability calculations to a water safety plan has the potential to increase accuracy of risk assessment in water safety planning keywords risk assessment risk matrices water quality data water safety plans 1 introduction the world health organization who has promoted the water safety plan wsp approach to managing and assessing risk in water supply systems since 2004 bartram et al 2009 who 2012 who 2016 the wsp manual developed to guide implementation and creation of wsps promotes the use of a risk matrix approach to evaluate the risk level associated with an identified hazard in a water system bartram et al 2009 a risk matrix is a semi quantitative tool used to understand risk using a scoring regime to determine whether a risk is low moderate or high risk a risk matrix calculates risk by multiplying a likelihood score by a consequence or severity score to obtain a risk score the risk score is then used to specify which scores are considered low moderate or high risk bartram et al 2009 who 2012 while a risk matrix has been shown to work well in situations where data is scarce or unavailable cox jr 2008 bartram et al 2009 who 2012 there are drawbacks associated with accuracy of the probability and impact estimations a risk matrix approach is subjective relying on a person s ability to understand probability and impact descriptions of likelihood and consequence levels differ not only between industries but within different jurisdictions in the water sector who 2012 bartram et al 2009 hokstad et al 2009 ausaid and sopac 2010 thompson and majam 2009 as an example unlikely is defined as once in a year in wsp documentation bartram et al 2009 hokstad et al 2009 thompson and majam 2009 however unlikely is also defined as occurring with a frequency of less than one incident monthly in specific case studies in australia alberta and the us where an incident refers to a data point falling outside the optimal operational parameters ausaid and sopac 2010 the environmental protection agency epa office of environmental enforcement 2011 aesrd 2011 the variations in definitions of likelihood led to difficulty comparing the frequency of occurrence of events across jurisdictions making it difficult to draw conclusions about the efficacy of the wsp approach globally currently the who promotes three different forms of risk assessment for water supply systems 1 a sanitary inspection or survey 2 a risk matrix approach and 3 a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra who 2016 the data input necessary for each method increases in both complexity and volume of data from sanitary surveys to qmras as previously discussed the risk matrix approach is considered semi quantitative by the who who 2012 for the purpose of this study we consider the risk matrix a qualitative method due to its subjective nature we examined documentation for the qmra approach to determine which types of quantitative data are commonly used in qmra as a starting point to identify quantitative data to compare to the risk matrix approach a review of the who guidance documentation of qmra methods who 2016 revealed that while quantitative models are used to determine the risk of infection by or presence of micro organisms in a water system there is little emphasis placed on other water quality parameters collected in a water system such as chlorine residual temperature ph and turbidity these parameters are often easier to collect than microbial parameters due to the wealth of field equipment available proven laboratory methods and the ease with which a large sample size can be taken who 2016 microbial data needed for a qmra is very specific and a large volume is needed to complete a full scale qmra howard et al 2006 who 2016 as a result we focused our analysis on easily measurable parameters in small water supply systems corresponding to hazards related to chlorine disinfection as there was a wealth of chlorine residual data available from the water systems included in this study quantitative calculations using water quality parameters such as chlorine residual provide a potential avenue to improve how risk matrices are constructed and used in water systems we hypothesize that risk matrix likelihood definitions informed by quantitative data from a water system are more likely to accurately assess risk in water systems definitions of likelihood that are arbitrary for example unlikely defined as less than once a month may not align with the actual probability of occurrence based on data which may be closer to less than once a year for example if risk matrix likelihood values are constructed using actual data from a water system we hypothesize that the risk matrix may more accurately reflect a water system s risks because it is driven by data from the water system data in many water systems is only used to ensure compliance to regulatory requirements we propose using the same data comprehensively over time to adapt the definitions of likelihood in a risk matrix to reflect capacity of the system however quantitative calculations are often unreliable in a system with sparse data sets with sampling programs dictated by regulatory guidelines who 2012 who 2016 compared to a qualitative risk matrix which allows any system to characterize risk regardless of data availability qualitative risk also describes more types of hazardous situations related to maintenance and operations that quantitative calculations cannot capture who 2012 bartram et al 2009 it is therefore important to recognize that quantitative calculations are not meant as a replacement of the risk matrix approach but as a new method to construct risk matrix likelihood definitions in high income countries or advanced water supply systems monitoring systems that generate a high volume of data are often already in place and stronger incentives to adopt a wsp approach are needed due to the prevalence of strong regulatory environments and robust monitoring systems summerill et al 2010 amjad et al 2016 baum et al 2015 baum and bartram 2017 the purpose of comparing risk analysis methods in this study was therefore to determine whether data currently being collected in a water system can provide a meaningful metic to calculate likelihood of occurrence or a new way to redefine how we generate likelihood descriptions in risk matrices a review of several possible risk analysis techniques was completed in 2009 by techneau detailing possible applications of risk analysis using water quality data from simple to complex hokstad et al 2009 however little evidence or literature exists suggesting these methods have been tested in countries where wsps are established or where implementation studies are being completed smeets et al 2011 demonstrated that there are different applications for quantitative water quality data in a wsp but largely focused on microbial data and the qmra approach in their study turbidity temperature and chlorine data were used to augment microbial data but the probability of being outside an optimal operating range was not calculated for these additional parameters nor were risk analysis calculations used to quantify probability of occurrence smeets et al 2011 the objective of this study was to explore how traditional risk analysis calculations such as probability density functions event trees etc of quantitative probability of failure compare to the results of the risk matrix method by comparing current likelihood definitions to calculated probabilities we can understand whether qualitative definitions align with actual data this tells us if the risk matrix is constructed in a way that reflects the risks in the actual system therefore this study examines two critical questions 1 do risk matrix definitions of likelihood align with the probability found from a quantitative probability calculation and 2 what does this imply for the construction of risk matrices risk matrices are recommended for small or underserved systems that do not have a large volume of water quality data however the small water systems used in this study do have sufficient data to justify quantitative calculations of probability this study compares quantitative probabilities calculated by using probability density functions and event trees to a probability obtained using definitions of likelihood and therefore probability in the risk matrix method the goal was to understand whether the risk matrix method is over or underestimating the likelihood of a hazardous event compared to water quality data for the purpose of this study calculations from water quality data were considered correct thus comparison presented in this study are presented with the assumption that the probability of occurrence from water quality data is better representative of actual system likelihood than the likelihood obtained from a risk matrix based on this analysis recommendations were made for the use of probability calculations in water safety plans and in the construction of risk matrices 2 methods 2 1 determining risk matrix probabilities for comparison to translate the risk matrix scores to probabilities descriptions of likelihood scores were evaluated from literature wsp risk matrices are designed such that the likelihood is equal to the probability of occurrence of an event most commonly an event where there is an inadequacy in the water treatment system or a failure to meet regulatory compliance values each likelihood level is described as 1 event in a month or 1 event in a year etc using these descriptions it was possible to obtain a probability for each likelihood description consequence or impact was not considered this study is focused on understanding the comparability of probabilities there are several ways to quantify consequence also termed severity or impact but choosing a specific method here for comparability was beyond the scope of this study likelihood descriptions from eight jurisdictions and case studies bartram et al 2009 hokstad et al 2009 the environmental protection agency epa office of environmental enforcement 2011 gunnarsdottir et al 2012 aesrd 2011 ausaid and sopac 2010 hokstad et al 2009 thompson and majam 2009 were considered to choose a range of probabilities for each likelihood level the range of probabilities are presented in table 1 a which outlines how likelihood descriptions were translated to probabilities for the purposes of this study in table 1a one occurrence represents one sample taken on one day where the chlorine residual is inadequate a previous study evaluated risk for a suite of hazardous events related to chlorine disinfection using a conditionally formated risk assessment questionnaire lane et al 2021 scores for likelihood 1 9 as presented in table 1 consequence and overall risk were recorded with this questionnaire for 22 different hazardous events including a hazard related to inadequate chlorine residual likelihood scores were extracted from the questionnaire for this specific hazardous event from these water systems for use in this study to compare likelihood score to quantitative probability of occurrence using table 1 table 1 presents the probability of occurrence as a value between 0 and 1 subsequent results present the same probability as a percentage between 0 and 100 based on likelihood descriptions and calculated probabilities each possible risk score from a risk matrix was assigned a probability for comparison to the quantitative probabilities of occurrence used in this study the calculated probabilities are presented with the assumption that an event or occurrence corresponds to one data point per day in table 1 the qualitative probability column is used for illustrative purposes only to show how likelihood values are described in literature these likelihood descriptions only apply to the scenario where an event is defined as one sample per day in this study probabilities were calculated by assuming one event corresponded to one day or to a daily sample taken in a water treatment facility thus if the likelihood description is once a week there are seven possible days on which the one event could occur or 1 7 0 143 the denominator to calculate the calculated probability in table 1a is therefore the number of possible days in the time frame laid out in the qualitative probability column of table 1a 2 2 quantitative probability calculations 2 2 1 probability density functions probability density functions pdfs and a simple event tree method were selected as two important risk calculations to consider for comparison to risk matrices the pdf method was chosen for its ubiquity in risk analysis literature and is a proven method for finding probabilities of occurrence based on different bounding criteria mcbean 2019b since chlorine residual data were always a positive number non negative distributions were fit to the data four potential distributions were chosen lognormal exponential weibull and gamma data was initially reviewed using a probability probability plot to visually determine which distribution best fit the data after initial review of the data the exponential distribution was removed visually using probability probability plots and empirical cumulative distribution functions the exponential distribution was not a good fit for the data and did not provide accurate calculations of probability an example probability probability plot is provided in the supplemental information figure s1 several goodness of fit tests were utilized and the akaike information criterion aic was selected the aic compares the relative fit of a distribution to the other chosen distributions hu 2007 the anderson darling test and the chi squared test were also used to conduct best fit tests for comparison to the aic results and the outcomes were similar to the aic test the formula for the aic test is presented in eq 1 in eq 1 k represents the number of estimated parameters in the model and l represents the maximum value of the likelihood function of the model hu 2007 the aic calculation was completed using the r software language and the base code function for aic with the assumption k 2 eq 1 a i c 2 k 2 ln l 2 2 2 event trees the event tree method was developed using models presented by techneau hokstad et al 2009 which combined fault trees and event trees to describe the overall risk in a system the event tree is used as a visual method of separating types of samples and finding the probability of each critical control point by dividing by the total sample probability hokstad et al 2009 event trees were constructed for chlorine residual data and critical control points were used to determine the bifurcation of branches in the event tree for example according to the guidelines for canadian drinking water quality gcdwq health canada 2019 chlorine residual must have a minimum value of 0 2 mg l to provide adequate disinfection data sets were evaluated using the event tree to determine if samples failed to meet this minimum the event tree was constructed for both sample collection frequency and regulatory guidelines enabled determination of how data availability influenced the probability of occurrence the chlorine residual event tree is shown in fig 1 the event tree for chlorine residual examines three factors if a sample was taken on a given day whether the sample was above 0 2 mg l and if the sample was above 0 4 mg l the 0 2 mg l threshold represents low chlorine as defined by national water quality guidelines serving as an indicator of inadequate disinfection this represents a high risk scenario in a wsp risk matrix the 0 4 mg l threshold was chosen as a near miss situation to determine how many samples were close to being below the 0 2 mg l threshold but were not yet considered high risk this represents a moderate risk scenario in a wsp risk matrix there are therefore three identified situations where samples can feasibly fall in the event tree ideal sampling near miss and low chlorine situations marked cannot occur are not physically possible but are included to provide a complete event tree event tree probabilities were calculated by dividing the number of samples matching the given criteria by the total number of samples probabilities are calculated at each node for example sample taken adequate chlorine the calculations for probability are shown in terms of variable values in fig 2 2 3 data collection and analysis to present comparisons of risk matrix probabilities to water quality data in this study the probability of occurrence is considered an accurate estimation of risk in the water system therefore an underestimation of risk represents a scenario in which the water quality data generates a probability of occurrence that is greater than the probability obtained from the risk matrix method an overestimation represents a situation in which the probability generated from data is less than the probability from the risk matrix an accurate estimation is one where the probability of occurrence from water quality data falls within the range of risk matrix probabilities in table 1 these conventions will be used throughout this paper for clarity chlorine residual data was collected from nine small water systems in nova scotia and new brunswick in 2017 table s1 each water system serves less than 500 people with the exception of system g which serves more than 1000 people and systems h and i which serve between 500 and 1000 people systems a g are owned and operated by municipal water utilities while systems h and i are owned and operated by first nations communities systems h and i do not currently have scada systems in place and have no other current method of collecting continuous data in their system therefore we used grab samples of chlorine residual for both the continuous and discrete data sets shown in table 2 at the time data was collected from system g no grab samples were available 2 3 1 qualitative data data for the nine water systems was generated in a previous study a questionnaire to identify hazards associated with chlorination was conducted in each system which generated a risk score for 22 different hazardous events lane et al 2021 permission to use water quality data from the two first nation systems included in this study was secured from the water system operators in each community our partner organization the atlantic policy congress of first nations chiefs apcfnc and the use of this data complies with the ocap principles first nations information governance centre 2020 lane et al used the risk score associated with a single hazardous event inadequate chlorine residual that was evaluated using the risk assessment questionnaire the probability in the questionnaire contained verbal probability descriptors such as rarely and occasionally the risk score for the inadequate chlorine residual hazardous event was translated to a probability of occurrence using table 1 2 3 2 quantitative data two different types of data were requested from the water systems that contributed to this study supervisory control and data acquisition scada data representing a large sample size with consistent sampling frequency and grab sampling data samples collected periodically although not always consistently and in a smaller volume water quality data was used to calculated probability of occurrence using the event tree calculation for both grab samples discrete data and scada continuous data to determine if there was a difference in the effectiveness of the event tree method based on data type pdfs were fitted to both data types and a best fit test was conducted using the aic the results were then compared to the probabilities obtained using table 1 inadequate chlorine residual was chosen as the hazardous event since concerns with chlorination are well documented and chlorine residual data is required by water quality guidelines health canada 2019 2 3 3 filling data gaps not every water system had complete data sets available to make accurate estimations of qualitative versus quantitative risk in the case where there is an asterisk located after the estimation in the following tables this result was estimated using assumptions of probability of risk based on table 1 if water safety plan risk matrix results were not available risk was assumed to be moderate risk and a probability of 0 03225 was used as the risk matrix qualitative probability in the case of scada data missing from a water system the probability of occurrence was assumed to be one in one thousand events or 0 1 for both the probability density function and event tree methods if grab samples were missing 0 1 probability of occurrence was assumed for the probability density function and 1 0 was assumed for the event tree method since the probability density function more often identifies the probability of occurrence as a relatively small percentage these numbers were chosen to avoid underestimating risk in cases where data was unavailable 2 4 sensitivity analysis 2 4 1 defining an event or occurrence defining an event as one occurrence per day provides a narrow comparison of the risk matrix probabilities to calculated probabilities therefore we have included a simple sensitivity analysis to examine how the definition of an event impacts the comparison in table 1 we have defined four different definitions of an event the original definition of an event implies that we have one sample per day and we evaluate that sample using the criteria for chlorine residual each day the probability of occurrence is based on one sample per day however depending on the type of water treatment system samples may be taken more frequently than once per day or less frequently than once per day depending on both the capacity of the treatment facility and the reporting requirements for regulatory compliance in our sensitivity analysis we have included two definitions of an event that correspond to an increase in sampling frequency sampling once per hour or every ten minutes as could occur with an advanced scada system and two definitions of an event that correspond to a decrease in sampling frequency sampling once per week or once per month of the water systems evaluated in this study table 2 we know that systems a f have the capacity to monitoring chlorine residual either hourly or every ten minutes informing the values for increased monitoring frequency in systems h and i in the past chlorine residual samples were only taken weekly or even monthly informing the values for decreased monitoring frequency when defining an event we did not change the likelihood descriptions provided from the risk matrix approach only the calculated probability values in table 1 in table 1b the sensitivity probability values in the four rightmost columns were calculated by changing the denominator of the calculation for example where an event was defined as one sample per week an occurrence of 1 in one month was found by dividing one by 4 weeks per month which equals 0 25 if the event was defined as one sample every hour then an occurrence of one in one day was found by dividing one by 24 which equals 0 042 after each scenario was defined we re evaluated our comparisons between the risk matrix probability and the calculated probabilities to determine if the risk matrix underestimates overestimates or is an accurate estimation of the likelihood of occurrence 2 4 2 constructing different risk matrices in this analysis we examine what the risk level associated with a calculated probability is based on different likelihood definitions using the pdf and event tree probabilities calculated above a water system could determine the likelihood of occurrence in a risk matrix each likelihood description implies a range of values for example 10 3 to 10 4 indicates moderate risk if the calculated probability of occurrence falls within this range then the water system can say that there is a moderate risk of inadequate chlorine driven by data the range of likelihood values depends on how the risk matrix is designed thus in this analysis we examine five different likelihood scenarios and determine the risk level associated with each water system based on the calculated probabilities this analysis attempts to examine how a water system can use a calculated probability of occurrence in tandem of with a risk matrix by 1 calculating the probability of having inadequate chlorine and 2 using that value to determine whether that likelihood falls into the low moderate or high risk categories in a risk matrix for this analysis we assumed the likelihood descriptors rare unlikely etc would remain the same and that the same nine risk levels would be present in the risk matrix and sought to understand how defining different frequencies of occurrence would change the results from the risk matrix for example if high risk ranges from 1 in 10 probability of 10 2 to 1 in 100 probability of 10 3 when an event is defined as one day how does this compare to an event defined as one week in the sensitivity analysis we examine how changing the event definition potentially changes the risk level assigned to an event by a risk matrix if the risk matrix is informed by data for example if the probability of occurrence is calculated as 1 in 10 000 which risk level does this correspond to in a risk matrix if the event is defined in one of the five ways presented in this study risk matrix data for the comparison component of this study relies on data from lane et al 2021 risk matrix data for the sensitivity analysis is hypothetical our initial comparison analysis therefore only examines the scenario where the risk matrix was constructed with the assumption that an event is one inadequate chlorine residual sample taken per day table 1a with risk matrix likelihood values coming from lane et al 2021 in our sensitivity analysis we then look at how changing the definition of an event changes the range of probability values associated with each likelihood bin in the risk matrix table 1b fig 2 shows these likelihood bins as a range of values for example 1 in 100 to 1 in 1000 events fig 2 shows the risk level boundaries change bins as the definition of an event changes we compared the calculated probability by either the pdf method or the event tree method to these new risk matrix definitions of likelihood to see how the risk level changed based on how the risk matrix was constructed the calculated probability from either the pdf or event tree method was evaluated to determine which likelihood bin the value corresponded to from the bin we then used table 1b to determine the risk level associated with each risk matrix 3 results 3 1 comparative analysis 3 1 1 probability density functions chlorine data sample sizes ranged from 107 samples to over eight million samples collected from scada data continuous sampling over the course of one year of data acquisition in system h and system i there was no automated data collection system and written daily logbook data was substituted for scada data for the probability density function calculation the akaike information criteria aic revealed the relative best fit for seven of the nine systems was the gamma distribution the second best fit distribution was also considered for the larger data sets and the lognormal distribution provides the second best fit in five of the nine communities the only system that did not have the gamma distribution as the best or second best fit was system d which had the largest data set at over eight million data points similar results were observed for grab sample data using probability density functions gamma provides the most accurate estimation most of the time table 3 shows the best fit and second best fit distributions for both continuous and discrete data for each water system for the majority of the system less than 1 in 1000 000 chlorine residual samples were less than the threshold of 0 2 mg l in table 3 this is shown as a percent which translates the 10 7 probability value 1 in 1000 000 samples to a percent 10 5 table 4 shows the probabilities obtained using the best fit probability density function for each system with both discrete and continuous data the column labeled qualitative level contains data extracted from lane et al 2021 for each water system and the column labeled qualitative probability presents the range of values corresponding to the qualitative level from table 1a due to the presence of several low risk hazardous events the majority of systems had a qualitative probability from the risk matrix conversion using table 1 in the range of 0 0548 0 00273 table 4 shows qualitative probability from the wsp risk matrix method in comparison to quantitative probability from the pdf as percentages the qualitative vs quantitative column in table 4 indicates whether the qualitative estimation is an overestimation underestimation or accurate estimation compared to the quantitative probability calculated using the pdf method overestimation represents a situation where the risk matrix probability is larger than the calculated probability underestimation occurs when the risk matrix probability is smaller than the calculated probability and accurate estimation occurs when the calculated probabilities fall in the range specified by the risk matrix results for both continuous and discrete data sets are presented in table 4 table 4 establishes the risk matrix method most often overestimates the probability of occurrence of low chlorine 0 2 mg l the probability calculated with a risk matrix is greater than the pdf method in 9 of 11 scenarios 82 system h and system i both have two possible hazardous events for chlorine one for the chlorine residual in the distribution system and one for the chlorine residual in storage in a treatment facility system h is the only system where the risk matrix underestimates or accurately estimates the quantitative probability of occurrence the prevalence of overestimation indicates the probability of occurrence of low chlorine residual is small in practice when compared to a risk matrix evaluation which is based on operator expertise but limited by the design of the risk matrix where scada data is used to calculate probability for grab samples a similar trend exists for pdf calculations with overestimation occurring in 82 of scenarios overestimation occurs in eight of eleven scenarios underestimation occurs in one scenario and there is one scenario where there was an accurate estimation of risk the case where the pdf method with grab samples matched the risk matrix probability range was the only case where a moderate risk level was identified in system h without additional water systems to evaluate it is difficult to determine if this is unique to system h or if hazards identified as moderate or high level risk are more often accurate compared to probability of occurrence 3 1 2 event tree method using event trees to calculate probability generated different results compared to the pdf method first where grab samples were evaluated with the event tree method there was more underestimation and accurate estimation than observed when using the pdf method in fact the risk matrix method does not overestimate the probability of occurrence with grab samples in the event tree table 4 shows that for seven of eleven cases 64 the risk matrix qualitative estimation was an underestimation of the risk observed using the event tree to calculate probability and was accurate in the remaining four cases this is markedly different than the pdf method which generally overestimated the actual risk in a system as calculated from water quality data results for the event tree method for both continuous and discrete data are presented in table 5 for the event tree method more data provided a more accurate estimation of the probability of occurrence six of the possible scenarios proved an accurate estimation of risk using the risk matrix only one scenario was an overestimation and the remaining scenarios were underestimations of risk this result indicates that the risk matrix method probabilities most closely align with the probabilities generated from the event tree method with a large data set 3 1 3 comparing analysis methods and data sets overall the risk matrix method provides the most accurate estimations of risk when compared to event tree method using continuous data scada the event tree method with discrete data grab samples results in the risk matrix predominantly underestimating risk and shows no indication of a biased estimation compared to the pdf method with discrete data the risk matrix overestimated risk in 9 of 11 cases compared to calculations from the pdf method using continuous data when comparing qualitatively obtained probabilities to those found from water quality data there are few cases ten cases out of 44 possible combinations 23 of data size and probability of occurrence calculation where the probabilities are of the same order of magnitude the risk matrix method most closely aligns with the probabilities calculated using the event tree and continuous data however only seven water systems were involved in this analysis and more water system data sets are needed to confirm this conclusion to better visualize the results figure 3 presents a probability probability plot comparing the risk matrix qualitative probability wsp risk matrix to quantitative risk as calculated by either of the event tree or pdf the y x line represents accuracy a point on or relatively close to this line indicates that quantitative and qualitative probabilities are approximately the same a point above this line represents an overestimation of risk since the qualitative risk is greater than the quantitative risk a point below this line represents an underestimation of risk since the qualitative risk is less than the quantitative risk the color of the point represents how far away from the y x line a point is in figure 3 there are only four cases where the risk obtained from the qualitative calculation is an accurate estimation of the quantitative risk in a system as calculated by using water quality data there are 4 cases of overestimation and 4 cases of underestimation presented on this plot this result demonstrates the subjectively of the risk matrix method which is highly susceptible to the knowledge of the person utilizing the risk matrix there is no clear indication whether the risk matrix tends to predominantly overestimate or underestimate the probability obtained from a pdf or event tree as accuracy occurs at the same frequency as over or underestimation the probability obtained using the wsp risk matrix method was determined using a questionnaire containing verbal probability descriptors such as rarely and occasionally verbal expressions of probability are often subjective and determinant of the stakeholder evaluating risk kolodziej et al 2017 thus the risk matrix method is highly variable depending upon stakeholder interpretation of likelihood definitions one stakeholder may interpret unlikely as an event that occurs once in a year while another may interpret unlikely as once in ten years leading to different resulting risk scores with the risk matrix method the lack of accuracy from the risk matrix when compared to pdf and event tree probabilities suggests that changes need to be made to the risk matrix method potential changes could include redefining and standardizing likelihood definitions in a risk matrix or considering the addition of water quality data to the water safety planning to more accurately express probability of occurrence 3 2 sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 changing the definition of an event after changing the definition of an event we ran the comparative analysis again with new qualitative probability ranges as shown in table 1b the results in this section focus on how the comparative analysis changes with the changing definition of an event only using the pdf method to calculate probability when the sampling frequency decreased an event every week or every month the risk matrix is more likely to overestimate risk the converse is also true when sampling frequency increased an event every hour or every ten minutes the risk matrix was more likely to underestimate or accurately estimate likelihood compared to the pdf table 6 shows the results of each scenario using the pdf calculation only when sampling frequency was decreased to every month 91 of the 22 scenarios water system plus data type resulted in the risk matrix overestimating risk when sampling frequency was decreased to every week 82 of the scenarios resulted in an overestimation using the event tree method we saw similar changes in estimations table s2 as sampling frequency increased the risk matrix was more likely to underestimate risk as sampling frequency decreased the risk matrix was more likely to overestimate or accurately estimate risk when sampling frequency was increased to every ten minutes 100 of the scenarios were underestimated by the risk matrix when sampling frequency was increased to every hour 95 of the scenarios were underestimated by the risk matrix these results from both the event tree and pdf methods indicate that the risk matrix estimations are sensitive to how the risk matrix likelihood values are defined since the likelihood values are defined by sample availability we can see that as more data is available samples every 10 min or when less data is available samples every month there is a greater tendency to incorrectly estimate risk using a risk matrix approach the initial comparison made the assumption that the calculated probability was based on an event defined as one sample per day for ease of comparison across the nine water systems however in practice systems a f there is capacity to sample every hour or every ten minutes because these systems have advanced scada systems in systems b f using the pdf method to calculate the probability of occurrence the risk matrix consistently overestimates the likelihood of inadequate chlorine if an event is defined as once every hour or once every ten minutes using the event tree method the risk matrix consistently underestimates the likelihood of inadequate chlorine only in system a using the pdf calculation and a event defined as every ten minutes does the risk matrix accurately estimate the likelihood of inadequate chlorine in systems h and i historically samples for chlorine residual were only taken weekly or even monthly if the pdf method is used to calculate probability of occurrence the risk matrix overestimates likelihood of inadequate chlorine for an event occurring once per week however if the event tree is used to calculate probability of occurrence the risk matrix is relatively accurate for the continuous data set and an event occurring once per week the difference between the definition of an event serve to further highlight the importance of defining likelihood in a risk matrix 3 2 2 evaluating different risk matrix constructions while the comparative sensitivity analysis above is based on risk matrix data from a previous study the analysis in this section focuses on hypothetical scenarios by calculating a probability of occurrence using either the pdf or event tree method we now know the likelihood of an event this analysis takes those calculated probabilities of occurrence and uses them to evaluate the risk level in each water system under different definitions of an event and therefore different likelihoods of occurrence table 7 presents the results from this analysis for probabilities calculated using the event tree method and table s3 presents results for probabilities calculated using the probability density function method as an example in system f the probability of occurrence of inadequate chlorine is 1 15 or 1 in 100 10 2 to 1 in 1000 10 3 when an event is defined as once every ten minutes this probability of occurrence falls into the high risk level however when an event is defined as once every hour the probability of occurrence falls into the moderate risk level if an event is defined as once a day once a week or once a month the risk level is low this simple example illustrates how the definition of likelihood values in a risk matrix is critical if a water system has sufficient data to calculate a probability of occurrence the water system still needs to make a judgement about the magnitude of that probability risk matrices have typically been employed to categorize levels of likelihood and risk and still have utility in this application however our results indicate that how likelihood is defined is critical to proper application 4 discussion 4 1 risk matrices do not align with actual probabilities of occurrence our comparison study revealed how often a risk matrix tends to overestimate probability of occurrence in a water system compared to probabilities calculated using water quality data several previous studies of small systems conclude more data collection is needed to make more accurate predictions of risk butterfield and camper 2004 kot et al 2011 schuster et al 2005 however using continuous data in a probability density function method for determining probability of occurrence demonstrated this is not the case the continuous data set was comprised of samples collected every hour this was chosen to decrease serial dependency in the data set but still provide a sufficiently large data set to analyze however it is possible that there is still a large degree of serial dependency in the data set that could have impacted the fitted distribution mean standard deviation and shape or scale for gamma and weibull distributions mcbean 2019c the probabilities obtained with the probability density function method were less than 1 with the exception of system h and the risk matrix method was an overestimation in all but 2 scenarios for continuous data the more samples that were collected using continuous data the smaller the probability of occurrence from a pdf became indicating that more data may lead to a false sense of security derived from this smaller probability of occurrence a failure of the chlorination system may occur regardless of past data a small probability of occurrence does not guarantee future hazardous events are unlikely in addition accuracy between the risk matrix and quantitative probabilities most often occurs with a large data set scada data and the event tree method this result is consistent with examination of risk assessment strategies for water system as performed by techneau in 2008 hokstad et al 2009 simpler methods were found to be more appropriate for most water systems particularly for small water systems without automated data collection hokstad et al 2009 however the majority of municipal systems in this study are considered small systems by atlantic canadian waterworks association standards acwwa 2004 these municipal systems had sufficient data to complete quantitative risk assessment calculations however in the wsp manuals for small systems the risk matrix method is used specifically due to concerns with adequate data collection who 2012 the who small systems manual defines a small system as a system that experience issues as a result of limited access to resources to resolve these issues who 2012 therefore our study adds to the body of literature suggesting population is not the best definition of a small system as the small municipal systems in this study did have strong data collection procedures and small populations serviced by the water system but experience issues larger municipal systems do not the results presented for the water systems in this study provide a limited representation of how quantitative data can augment a wsp focus was placed on chlorine disinfection hazards and only 2 of the possible 22 hazards from the risk assessment questionnaire lane et al 2021 were used for comparison to quantitative data having data to support a similar comparison for other hazards such as high turbidity absence of maintenance records and incorrect chlorine dose calculations would improve future studies in addition six of seven of the water systems involved in this study had low risk identified for the hazardous event with only one community system h having a moderate risk hazardous event the predominance of low risk hazardous events needs to be considered in the interpretation of our results small probabilities are often more difficult to quantify and convey to stakeholders kolodzieg et al 2017 in a water system which may account for the lack of accuracy observed as a result it is currently unknown whether the probability density function method and event tree method would provide the same results if the hazardous events had been identified as moderate level or high level risk and thereby have a higher probability of occurrence based on table 1 this study is able to confirm that low risk hazardous events have smaller quantitative probabilities but cannot verify if the conclusions made about each method and data set are valid for higher risk situations 4 2 interpretation of small probabilities by water system stakeholders one of the primary concerns with the small probability values generated by the pdf and event tree methods 10 5 is the interpretation of these small values by water system stakeholders literature suggests the majority of people who have no or limited experience with risk assessment cannot accurately process or properly understand small probabilities less than 1 tyszka and sawicki 2011 idzikowska et al 2017 furthermore depending on the amount of information available about probabilities and risks people have different perceptions of how risky a low probability but high impact event actually is michailova et al 2017 idzikowska et al 2017 tyszka and sawicki 2011 tyszka and zielonka 2017 small probabilities represented as numeric values are difficult for people to understand and the method of risk communication greatly impacts a stakeholder s understanding of a risky situation michailova et al 2017 kolodzieg et al 2017 visschers et al 2008 in the context of this study the probabilities generated by the pdf method are less than 1 e 10 in five of eleven scenarios for scada data sets and less that 1 0 in nine of eleven scenarios this translates to event with extremely rare or never likelihood from a risk matrix however events that have never occurred in water systems can occur in future situations jalba and hrudey 2006 and the small probabilities observed in this study provide information that can lead to the misconstrued assumption of safe water quality according to tyszka and zielonka this result is termed unrealistic optimism the underestimating of the likelihood of negative events and the overestimating of the likelihood of positive events tyszka and zielonka 2017 the wsp approach promotes interaction with multiple stakeholders in a water system to best describe risk bartram et al 2009 who 2012 however research has shown that decisions made from experience and descriptions of hazardous situations tend to underestimate risk tyszka and zielonka 2017 a study of the alberta drinking water safety plan in 2014 showed stakeholders tend to rate risks as low or moderate risk because high risk indicated a stakeholder was not completing his or her job drachenberg 2014 given that 15 of 44 scenarios examined in this study were underestimations of risk in a water system and ten scenarios were accurate stakeholder knowledge alone does not provide consistent or accurate understanding of hazardous event likelihood in water systems other studies of probability perception have indicated people care more about the impact of a risky situation than the probability of a situation michailova et al 2017 indicating consequence plays a critical role in risk evaluation and cannot be considered independent of likelihood this observation alludes to inherent bias in how risk assessment is performed in a wsp information about risk from water stakeholders needs to be properly balanced with calculations of probability to mitigate underestimation of likelihoods and more accurate measures of consequence need to be identified to address overall risk communication of the small probabilities observed in this study and translation of these values into likelihood values in a risk matrix is therefore critical several studies have been conducted to best understand how to present information about small probability high impact events to stakeholders kunreuther et al 2001 concluded that the best method for overcoming communication concerns is by providing comparisons kunreuther et al 2001 one possibility is a paling perspective scale a visual representation of probabilities in relation to probabilities of well known events or scenarios visschers et al 2008 the overall conclusion is that a reference point or contextual information is needed in for small probabilities to be comprehensible kunreuther et al 2001 visschers et al 2008 in general graphical representations of probabilities are easier to understand chua et al 2006 as cited by kolodziej et al 2017 pictographs function well in situations where low literacy or numeracy exists but are difficult to use with low probabilities visschers et al 2008 in the context of the water quality data evaluated in this study further research on how probability of occurrence can be accurately presented graphically or visually to stakeholders will be critical visschers et al 2008 found that verbal probabilities are often better to communicate probabilities to people but lack the technical accuracy to capture the entire hazardous scenario verbal probabilities are currently used in the wsp risk matrix method but are defined qualitatively instead of scaled numerically to better improve both likelihood descriptions in risk matrices probabilities obtained by using water quality data need to inform more accurate descriptions of probability to ground these terms in the reality experienced by the water systems stakeholders in water systems with advanced data collection calculations of probabilities can be used to define likelihood levels as a range of values defined specifically by the water system stakeholders to align with the wsp principle of community specificity bartram et al 2009 the verbal probabilities such as likely can be used to better communicate results to all stakeholders in a water system once these probabilities are grounded in verbal terms that reflect the data gathering capabilities of the water system 4 3 implications for water safety planning risk analysis 4 3 1 benefits of adding quantitative data to risk assessments previous studies of wsp implementation have shown that buy in to wsps as a risk management method can be challenging particularly where water system culture is focused on regulation summerill et al 2010a the addition of water quality data to the risk assessment component of water safety planning provides a new incentive for water system to adopt the wsp methodology additionally benefits of wsps were not always clear to water system stakeholders and the qualitative nature of the wsp method made it difficult for stakeholders to understand how this method could fit into the current water management culture summerill et al 2010a amjad et al 2016 the quantitative risk calculations utilized in this study provide a new avenue for integrating water quality data to a water safety plan that aligns more closely with a municipal stakeholder mindset the data driven culture found in the water systems studied previously is not unique summerill et al 2010a several other advanced water systems place focus on data collection to help meet requirements for regulatory compliance at a provincial level integrating water quality data into the structure of a risk matrix and the evaluation of likelihood of occurrence allows stakeholders to continue to sample for water quality parameters to meet regulations while also informing risk management quantitatively in the system through calculations of probability of occurrence for a more accurate wsp risk assessment using quantitative risk analysis fits nicely in regulatory based cultures and may be acceptable to many stakeholders as evidence of water safety plan utility for decision making scada and other continuous data sets are often used strictly for compliance or regulatory purposes and using this data productively in a wsp could incentivize wsp adoption in locations with highly regulated water systems quantitative methods are currently utilized in the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach who 2016 however the focus is placed on pathogenic organisms and microbial contaminants this study demonstrates the potential to include water quality parameters already collected in water systems such as chlorine residual to provide additional information about quantitative risk not previously captured by wsp risk matrices the methods presented in this study provide a bridge between the current risk matrix approach and the qmra the who promotes three levels of risk assessment sanitary surveys risk matrices and the qmra who 2016 studies of the qmra process in small systems have generated mixed results howard et al 2006 found that a qmra can be used in situation with limited data but point estimations at sampling locations in a distribution system do not necessarily capture the full range of disease exposure howard et al 2006 another study advocated for the use of water quality data where possible to strengthen the qmra approach as a single water quality parameter is unlikely to be appropriate across all water systems saxena et al 2015 these studies indicate there may be a benefit to adding quantitative probability calculations presented in this study and use of indicator parameters such as chlorine residual to aide water system evaluations of microbial contamination for water systems without capacity to collect the needed data for a qmra but enough monitoring data to necessitate a more sophisticated method than a risk matrix the pdf and event tree provide a logical first step for more rigorous risk evaluation in addition to integrating this approach into the continuum of risk assessments recommended by the who this method is adaptable to specific water system needs a requirement of the wsp methodology bartram et al 2009 who 2012 who 2016 for example 0 2 mg l of chlorine residual was chosen in the event tree method as this is the regulatory value specified by health canada health canada 2019 a near miss was defined as less than 0 4 mg l of chlorine residual however these values are specific to the water systems evaluated in this study and can be adapted to individual water systems as needed furthermore the probability density function method has the same characteristic the probability of occurrence or failure was calculated using the 0 2 mg l value as the criteria if a water system desired a higher threshold to serve as an advance warning of possible inadequate disinfection this is an easy adjustment with both methods examined in this study making pdfs and event trees more flexible than risk matrices compared to the risk matrix method this is an advantage the risk matrix method does not allow for multiple easy calculations of risk based on several different scenarios cox jr 2008 mcbean 2019a however with the addition of quantitative risk assessment calculations it is possible to model several hazardous scenarios to best adjust control measures and risk mitigation procedures in a water system 4 3 2 recommendations for risk matrix construction the sensitivity analysis conducted in this study highlights the importance of defining an event and associating that specific event with a probability of occurrence when an event was defined as one day high risk probabilities of occurrence range from one to 1 in 100 events when an event is defined as one hour the high risk probabilities of occurrence range from one to 1 in 1000 events if the calculated probability of occurrence using either the pdf or event tree method is 1 100 events in the first scenario the risk level will be high but will be moderate in the second scenario while this result is intuitively understood in the risk assessment community this study attempts to highlight the importance of risk matrix construction for the water industry where probabilities of occurrence are often very small in practice based on these results we recommend a water system examine the data available in their system and use this data to best construct a risk matrix applicable to their system the risk matrices found in literature who 2012 bartram et al 2009 hokstad et al 2009 ausaid and sopac 2010 thompson and majam 2009 the environmental protection agency epa office of environmental enforcement 2011 are based on arbitrary definitions of likelihood we recommend that a water system use actual water quality data to construct a risk matrix that is reasonable based on the sampling frequency for parameters such as chlorine residual turbidity and ph if calculated probabilities of occurrence in a system are so small that a risk matrix from literature always evaluated the risk as low the water system will consistently underestimate the risk of an event constructing a risk matrix based on data from the water system could be a key step to using water system data more productively to inform risk constructing the risk matrix based on data takes time and likely the input from a professional trained to specifically conduct risk assessments to remove some of the work training and calculating probabilities one possible solution would be to automate the process of calculating probabilities of occurrence based on water quality data with a software solution it is important that operators and managers of a water system understand why the risk matrix is constructed however the pdf and event tree calculations can be complicated to learn and may decrease a water system s ability to uptake such a rigorous method for constructing a risk matrix we recommend automating the calculations of probability using a coding language or software that reads in formated data from scada or excel log books and performs the calculations automatically in this software we recommend the water system has the ability to change the criteria associated with a specific water quality parameter for example less than 0 2 mg l of residual chlorine this method of risk matrix construction is aimed at creating better informed definitions of likelihood without the need to train operators and managers how to calculate probabilities of occurrence 5 conclusions while the risk matrix is ideal for situations where there is little water quality data available there are water systems that do not recognize the benefits of a wsp due to stringent data collection policies for regulatory compliance and also have a culture centered on water quality monitoring integrating quantitative risk analysis techniques into the wsps developed for water systems can provide another incentive for wsp adoption that did not exist previously one that aligns with water systems that are focuses on meeting regulations for compliance comparing the risk matrix method utilized in water safety planning to quantitative calculations of probability of occurrence revealed that the risk matrix approach is only comparable to probabilities calculated from water quality data 23 of the time 10 of 44 possible scenarios when the probability density function was used the risk matrix method tended to overestimate risk in a water system while risk matrices tended to underestimate risk compared to the event tree calculation the highest accuracy was seen where data sets were larger and the quantitative risk calculation was simpler expansion of this study to include other operational parameters such as ph and turbidity would provide additional evidence to support the conclusions presented here for chlorine residual quantitative calculations are not appropriate in all water systems particularly where data availability does not support calculations of probability of occurrence however where data is available the addition of quantitative calculations provides a more accurate picture of risk than the risk matrix method and provides another risk evaluation method for the wsp

15991,most studies on the interaction between coagulation and nom natural organic matter currently focus on pollutant removal and coagulant species distribution while studies on floc aging are lacking investigation onto the effects of floc aging could guide further processes that utilize flocs such as densadeg sludge recirculation floc predeposition for ultrafiltration sludge condensation and other traditional sludge reflux processes in this study flocs generated by al13 and alcl3 in microparticle and nanoparticle containing water were investigated and the effect of floc aging on nom was quantified based on several organic matter characterization techniques flocs absorb and release organics during aging the flocs generated from micro sio2 have a significant absorbing effect for lwm n low molecular weight neutral substances and protein like substances while the absorption of nom by flocs generated from nano sio2 is insignificant hs humic substances with high aromaticity are released during floc aging from the molecular perspective the molecules released during floc aging are those with higher double bond equivalents and higher aromaticity while the absorbed molecules are those with lower double bond equivalents and lower aromaticity 2d cos two dimensional correlation spectroscopy demonstrated that the flocs generated by al13 and alcl3 had the same organic release patterns but different intensities while the flocs generated in the micro sio2 and nano sio2 systems had different organics release patterns abundant aluminum hydrolysates with low polymerization and amorphous al oh 3 would be produced from alcl3 during the coagulation process and then undergo hydroxyl bridging reaction and crystallization during floc aging thus releasing more hs with high aromaticity into the supernatant in comparison prehydrolyzed al13 produces a more stable floc and releases less hs during aging the flocs produced by nano sio2 and al based coagulants release higher aromaticity hs into the water than those produced by micro sio2 which may be related to the formation of more highly polymerized degree hydrolysates and nanocrystalline al oh 3 in the nano sio2 system the flocs generated in water with micro sio2 may contain a large amount of al oh and have a loose structure thus further absorbing nom such as protein like substances and lwm n in contrast the flocs generated from nano sio2 possess abundant adsorbed water and a denser structure thus organic matter cannot be absorbed stably graphhical abstract image graphical abstract keywords al based coagulant

coagulants include monomers oligomers low mer mid mer high mer sol or gel and precipitates which can also be categorized into ala alb and alc by ferron time complexation spectrophotometry wang et al 2021 mechanisms for removing nom during coagulation can be different for various hydrolysis forms of aluminum yan et al 2008 and include complexation of ala electroneutralization of alb and sweeping of alc wang et al 2020 in water treatment processes not only is the coagulant important but the influence of the flocs cannot be ignored for example flocs are involved in densadeg sludge recirculation to accelerate water purification chen et al 2020 predeposited flocs to alleviate membrane fouling ma et al 2018 and sludge condensation and reflux in water supply plants moreover the effects of flocs on nom cannot be ignored as amorphous al oh 3 adsorbs or sweeps ha humic acids liu et al 2009 pommerenk and schafran 2005 yu et al 2010 it is worth noting that al oh 3 transforms from an amorphous form to a crystalline form during floc aging anderson and berkowitz 2010 wu et al 2019 yu et al 2018 during aging the surface area of al oh 3 decreases while the particle size distribution of the flocs becomes narrower berkowitz et al 2005 yu et al 2018 these changes will result in the release or absorption of contaminants for example it has been demonstrated that phosphorus removed by coagulation would be released during floc aging and the adsorption capacity of aged flocs for phosphorus will be reduced berkowitz et al 2006 in addition it has been demonstrated that floc aging will lead to greater membrane fouling in the process of coagulation membrane to remove ha yu et al 2019 due to the aging effect the adsorption capacity of al oh 3 for ha will be reduced wu et al 2019 and the ability to alleviate membrane fouling and the ha removal efficiency are also reduced during floc deposition on ultrafiltration membranes ma et al 2018 these phenomena can be detrimental and could cause secondary contaminantion if not handled properly al13 and alcl3 are two representative al based coagulants where al13 is the stable al prehydrolysis product yue et al 2021 these two coagulants show different nom removal mechanisms and the flocs generated from al13 and alcl3 are composed of different components flocs generated by al13 mainly contain al13 al13agg al13 aggregates al oh 3 and other hydrolysates while flocs generated by alcl3 mainly contain al oh 3 and hydrolysates tang et al 2015 zhao et al 2008 therefore the flocs produced by the two coagulants may differ during floc aging and nom absorption and release may also differ however research on floc aging is still lacking and knowledge of the effect of flocs on nom during aging is almost absent the interaction between nom and coagulants includes many chemical and physical processes wang et al 2021 moreover the related processes during floc aging are not clear which may lead to the release and absorption of nom investigation of the variations in nom during floc aging would be helpful to further clarify the interaction mechanism between coagulants and organic matter to optimize coagulation as well as the combination process to determine the optimal time for sludge discharge and recirculation and to provide a new perspective for coagulation in addition to the coagulant al species distribution the particle size affects the floc properties sun et al 2019 e g flocs generated by micro sio2 particles have a lower fractal dimension but a higher strength factor and recovery factor than flocs generated by nano sio2 particles sun et al 2019 in a coagulation experiment involving al based coagulants and ha nano tio2 synthetic water the interaction of ha with nano tio2 in the water made precipitation more difficult xu et al 2014 and an increase in nano tio2 led to loose flocs fan et al 2018 under such conditions particle size may change the release and absorption of nom during floc aging in this paper floc aging studies were conducted on microparticle nom synthetic water and nanoparticle nom synthetic water using two representative al based coagulants alcl3 and al13 considered to be the most active ingredients in polyaluminum chloride yue et al 2021 this study mainly aimed to investigate 1 the change pattern of nom during floc aging and 2 the effects of different particle sizes on the release and absorption of nom the nom components of the supernatant during aging were fully identified using uv vis spectroscopy 3deem three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy lcocd liquid chromatography organic carbon detection and fticr ms fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to analyze the relationship between the release and absorption of nom during floc aging the flocs were also characterized by xrd x ray diffraction ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy to observe the changes that occurred in flocs during the aging process 2 materials and methods 2 1 coagulants and synthetic raw water the alcl3 coagulant was prepared from alcl3 6h2o ar sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd al13 was prepared in our lab and detailed information is described in a previous report an et al 2021 alcl3 and al13 stock solutions were prepared at a concentration of 0 1 mol l micro sio2 powder 10 μm shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd and nano sio2 powder 15 nm shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd were selected for use as micro and nano particles respectively the micro and nano sio2 stock suspensions were prepared at a concentration of 1 5 g l which were stirred at high speed for 3 h and sonicated for 120 min to fully disperse detailed information about the physicochemical properties of micro sio2 and nano sio2 is presented in text s1 and figure s1 raw water was obtained from yiwu city jinhua city zhejiang province china to remove the complex particulate matter from the surface water and reduce the effects of microorganisms the raw water was passed through a 0 45 μm membrane and then a certain amount of sio2 stock suspension was added to prepare the synthetic raw water the particulate matter in the synthetic raw water was 50 mg l and the ph was 7 3 7 5 detailed information on the physicochemical characteristics of the synthetic raw water is listed in table s3 2 2 supernatant and flocs the coagulation procedure was carried out as follows 1 min of rapid stirring at 200 r min to was performed to stabilize the water sample 0 1 mmol l coagulant was then added and the stirring rate of 200 r min was maintained for 1 5 min to adequately mix the coagulant and water sample then flocs were continuously generated by 10 min of slow stirring at 40 r min and the sample was finally allowed to settle for 30 min after coagulation cling film was used to seal the beakers to prevent evaporation of the supernatant and interference from carbon dioxide in the air coagulation experiments were conducted in 500 ml beakers on a meiyu coagulation test stirrer my3000 6 n at ambient room temperature the coagulation experiments of micro sio2 and nano sio2 with al13 and alcl3 produced four different systems called mal13 malcl3 nal13 and nalcl3 respectively additionally msio2 and nsio2 represent the micro sio2 system and nano sio2 system aging times were set at 0 2 6 12 24 48 72 96 and 120 h as previous studies demonstrated that the ph of the supernatant during floc aging varies drastically from 0 to 24 h and plateaus after 100 h anderson 2004 anderson and berkowitz 2010 to avoid changes in the aging environment caused by sampling each independent coagulation experiment was performed only once when the aging time was reached the supernatant was immediately collected at 2 cm below the water surface to determine its ph fe28 mettler toledo and a certain amount of supernatant was taken and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for subsequent measurements flocs were obtained through filtration of the remaining liquid in the beaker and stored in a dark dry environment after air drying three parallel experiments were conducted for each batch of experiments 2 3 analytical methods to obtain comprehensive insight into the release and absorption pattern of organic matter during floc aging the supernatant was passed through a 0 45 μm membrane and then nom was determined by total organic carbon analysis toc l cpn shimadzu japan uv vis spectrophotometry tu 1810 persee 3deem f 7000 fl spectrophotometer and lcocd doc labor to better observe the changes in organic matter during aging uv vis measurements were performed using a 5 cm cuvette with a scanning wavelength of 190 600 nm 2d cos two dimensional correlation spectroscopy was applied to analyze the changes in uv active substances the instrument parameters for 3deem were as follows the wavenumbers for excitation and emission light were 200 400 nm and 220 550 nm respectively with a resolution of 5 nm the pmt photomultiplier tube voltage was 700 v and the scan speed was 60 000 nm min parafac parallel factor analysis and hix humification index were applied to calculate and analyze 3deem data information about the 2d cos and 3deem data processing methods are presented in text s2 and text s3 respectively to gain molecular insight the supernatant was subjected to fticr ms bruker solarix after solid phase extraction agilent bond elut ppl detailed information on fticr ms is presented in text s4 xrd rigaku ultima iv was used to investigate the changes in floc crystallization during aging and the scanning angle range was 5 90 with a 2 min scanning speed residual aluminum and silica were determined by measuring the supernatant after microwave digestion using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7700 ftir thermo scientific nicolet is20 and xps thermo scientific k alpha were applied to analyze the surface of net flocs generated from coagulant and net silica only 3 results and discussion 3 1 doc and uv vis analysis in msio2 alcl3 has a greater nom removal than al13 figure s2 a b c d which may be attributed to the rapid hydrolysis of ala and the generation of abundant al oh 3 tending to absorb more nom the uv254 plots figure s2 b e show that flocs release uv254 active substances and flocs generated from alcl3 release more uv254 material during aging the doc dissolved organic matter plot of msio2 shows a decreasing tendency while the doc plot of nsio2 shows smooth volatility as shown in figure s2 c f suva254 has an increasing trend in all four aging experiments this further indicates that the flocs may absorb some of the non uv254 active substances while some uv254 substances removed by coagulation are released in the aging process to derive the release mechanism of uv active substances in the four different systems we used uv 2d cos to explore the changes fig 1 a c e g are the uv synchronous correlation spectra of mal13 malcl3 nal13 and nalcl3 respectively which show no cross peak but intense auto peaks in the range of 194 201 nm mal13 and malcl3 and 198 204 nm nal13 and nalcl3 the auto peak indicates that the uv absorbance consistently increases at a specific range of wavelengths phong and hur 2016 the intensity of synchronous auto peaks could be related to the sensitivity of the external perturbation to the spectrum mee jung and noda 2006 phong and hur 2016 e g the sensitivity of floc aging time to the release of uv active organics in this paper by comparison of fig 1 a c and fig 1 e g alcl3 floc is more affected by aging time than al13 flocs and the nom release sensitivity of nsio2 is higher than that of msio2 which illustrates that more uv active substances would be released in the presence of nanoparticles corresponding to the results in figure s2 asynchronous spectra reveal the sequence of changes in external vibrations at different wavelengths chen and yu 2021 hur et al 2011 according to the results of asynchronous spectra fig 1 b d f h two specified wavelength bands were selected for comparison and it was found that the change at 255 275 nm preceded that at 195 215 nm previous studies demonstrated a correlation between 250 and 280 nm uv absorption and electronic transitions in aromatic structures in ha and fa fulvic acid such as phenolic compounds benzoic acid and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons chin et al 1994 hur et al 2011 therefore substances with aromatic structures are released before substances with lower wavelength absorption during aging and aromatic ha may become more unstable in binding to al oh 3 than substances with lower wavelength absorption during aging different cross peaks were identified such as 197 190 and 230 197 in mal13 190 195 and 231 197 in malcl3 202 191 220 220 230 220 260 200 and 260 230 in nal13 and 205 191 230 210 and 255 230 in nalcl3 specific wavelength peaks were selected from the cross peak to analyze the release of uv active organics release in the micro sio2 system and the nano sio2 system shows that the sequence of change in msio2 is 255 230 197 190 while that in nsio2 is 255 210 230 191 this finding indicates that al13 and alcl3 release uv active organics in a similar pattern while the flocs generated from msio2 and nsio2 release organics with a different pattern therefore it is necessary to consider not only the type of coagulants but also the particle size in water treatment processes involving floc aging as the patterns of release of organic matter are different for different particle sizes 3 2 3deem to gain further insight into the changes in organic components 3deem was applied to characterize the nom in supernatant and the results are shown in figures s3 6 fig 2 a h shows that the fluorescence intensity of msio2 decreases during aging whlie the fluorescence intensity of nsio2 changes little which is comparable to the doc results parafac was applied to analyze the 3deem data of msio2 and nsio2 stedmon and bro 2008 four similar components were identified and the results are shown in fig 2 k n the component loading plots of the components for the two systems are presented in figure s7 the four components are named c1 c2 c3 and c4 which can be mainly classified as fa ha aromatic protein ii tryptophan like protein substances and aromatic protein i complexes and its protein like substances respectively chen et al 2003 as shown in fig 2 i mal13 could absorb c1 c3 and c4 significantly during aging but not c2 in malcl3 the changes in c1 c3 and c4 components are similar to those in mal13 but the c2 component shows an increasing tendency this indicates that the malcl3 flocs release ha like substances while some fa and protein like substances are further removed by the flocs in nsio2 c1 and c2 show a tendency to increase in the early stage and then become smooth while the variation in c3 and c4 fluctuations these variations are consistent with the trend for doc in nsio2 but differ from the trend in uv results this may indicate that fluorescence active substances may not be the main substances that are consistently released but rather uv active substances moreover initially released ha and fa like substances are mainly fluorescence active to further characterize the humification of nom hix was applied to estimate the humification level of nom figure s8 zheng et al 2022 the patterns of hix variation follow similar patterns to uv in msio2 alcl3 flocs are more likely to release highly humified organic matter while al13 is more stable and less variable in nsio2 the flocs formed by both coagulants show a pattern of releasing humified organic matter first and then smoothly combinind these results with figure s2 it could be suggests that the released uv active organic matter is the organic matter with a higher degree of humification incorporating the above findings further suggests that the uv active organic matter released during aging consists of those with a high degree of humification e g fa and ha this conclusion agrees with the previous conclusion that the flocs can bind some of the ha stably in mal13 spearman correlation analysis was used to statistically analyze the indicators during aging fig 3 ar the absorbance ratio of uv254 and uv203 is positively correlated with the aromaticity of nom zha et al 2018 the ar change plot during aging is presented in figure s9 most of the mal13 and malcl3 statistical indicators show a significant correlation pattern while most of the indicators in nsio2 show no significant correlation relationship therefore flocs in nsio2 seem to have an unclear pattern of nom release and absorption there is a significant positive correlation between ph and uv254 in the four systems in addition there is a significant negative correlation between doc and ar indicating that the absorbed organics are lower aromaticity nom while the released organics are higher aromaticity nom although c1 and c2 belong to hs they show a negative correlation with hix except for c2 in malcl3 these results further indicate that the released ha and fa are more humified and aromatic while the lower humified and aromatic ha and fa are further absorbed it is worth noting that the change in uv254 in the mal13 system is not drastic which corresponds to the lower release of humified and aromatic organic matter 3 3 lcocd to obtain precise information on the release and absorption of organic matter during floc aging lcocd was applied lcocd provides a comprehensive characterization of nom components such as biopolymers bps aquatic humics hs building blocks bb low molecular weight lmw neutrals lwm n and lmw acids lwm a and more accurate information on their molecular weight and aromaticity can be obtained by tandem liquid chromatography with organic carbon detector ocd uv254 detector uvd and organic nitrogen detector ond villacorte 2014 the lcocd results are presented in figures s10 11 hs at a retention time of 21 5 min shows a distinct increasing trend in the uvd curves which proves that the released hs is the dominant uv active matter bps show a pattern of increasing in 0 6 h but decreasing in 6 120 h in msio2 flocs fig 4 a b hs generally increases from 18 0 to 21 in mal13 and from 12 6 to 24 8 in malcl3 during aging with its aromaticity generally increasing from 2 54 to 2 63 l mg m in mal13 and 2 10 to 2 86 l mg m in malcl3 this implies that nom released during floc aging is mainly hs with high aromaticity which is consistent with section 3 2 for lwms low molecular weight substances the percentages of bb and lwm a in the supernatant increased from 10 1 to 11 4 and 18 5 to 19 7 in mal13 respectively and from 10 0 to 12 and 14 5 to 19 2 in malcl3 with lwm n showing a drastic decreasing trend from 50 8 to 42 0 in mal13 and from 53 5 to 39 6 in malcl3 fig 4 a b considering these results in conjunction with the fig 2 and lcocd plots the absorbed molecules may be the protein like substances with small molecular weights furthermore lwm n has a greater decrease which means that lwm n is the main substance absorbed during aging in msio2 regarding release hs is the dominant released substances followed by bb and lwm a in nsio2 the content and ratio of bps and hs fluctuate during aging fig 4 c d for the lwms lwm n changes with less variation which indicates that nsio2 flocs may not be conducive to the absorption of macromolecules and lwm n although the hs content does not change significantly in ocd the uvd shows an increasing trend in the hs region figure s11 and their aromaticity generally increases from 2 77 to 3 46 l mg m in nal13 and 2 46 to 3 53 l mg m in nalcl3 moreover the hs released in nsio2 has higher aromaticity than that released in msio2 these results are related to 3deem and uv which further demonstrate that the increased uv absorbance is attributed to the release of hs with high aromaticity and humification 3 4 fticr ms fticr ms was applied to characterize nom at the molecular level and detailed information about fticr ms is presented in the text s4 and figures s12 13 fig 5 shows the molecular density distribution of the van krevelen diagram and nosc vs dbe o c plots of malcl3 nosc is the nominal oxidation state of carbon which could indicate that the carbon atoms per molecule are in a reduced state deb o is the oxygen extracted double bond equivalent which could indicate the unsaturation degree of the carbon skeleton ma et al 2021 comparing fig 5 a b the absorbed and released of nom mainly consists of molecules in ligins and car condensed aromatics which are mainly distributed in the intervals of o c 0 675 and h c 1 5 and released molecules have a much lower h c than absorbed molecules in fig 5 c d zone 1 zone 2 zone 3 and zone 4 represent nom with oxidized and unsaturated properties reduced and unsaturated properties reduced and saturated properties and oxidized and saturated properties respectively zhang et al 2021a there is a difference between the molecules released and absorbed by aging with most of the absorbed nom in zone 3 and the released nom in zone 1 which indicates that the flocs prefer to absorb reduced and saturated nom and release oxidized and unsaturated nom the distribution of nom shifts from zone 2 3 to zone 1 4 which reveals that molecules in the oxidized state may not be well absorbed and that absorbed oxidized nom may have some risk of release the fticr ms data for mal13 nal13 and nalcl3 are presented in figures s15 17 their molecular distributions are similar to that of malcl3 with released and absorbed molecules mainly distributed in ligins and car although no significant difference was found in the density distribution of nosc vs dbe o c the average values of dbe o and nosc confirms that the released nom has higher values of dbe o and nosc indicating that unsaturated and oxidized nom are more easily released during aging the nosc vs dbe o c plots for released nom in the four systems show a weak peak in zone 2 0 50 deb o c 0 75 0 5 nosc 0 which may be part of the highly unsaturated nom corresponding to the van krevelen plot of car this indicates that car with a high dbe o value belongs to nom which is easily released during aging in comparison with aimod indicating aromaticity the average aimod of the released molecules is higher than that of the absorbed molecules in the four systems as a result the released molecules are those with a higher double bond content and aromaticity while the absorbed molecules are those with lower double bond equivalents and lower aromaticity which leads to an increase in uv absorbance in the supernatant 3 5 flocs figure s18 shows that ph would rise and then stabilize during aging which is consistent with previous studies anderson 2004 anderson and berkowitz 2010 berkowitz et al 2005 the origin supernatant ph curves figure s18 a b are more volatile than the filtered ones figure s18 c d which indicates that the flocs would release alkaline substances to the supernatant during aging as shown in figure s18 a b al13 flocs show fewer ph shifts which means that alcl3 flocs released more alkaline substances during aging than al13 flocs al13 medium polymer mainly produces al13 al13agg al oh 3 and other hydrolysates during coagulation while alcl3 mainly produces al oh 3 and hydrolysates wu et al 2019 zhao et al 2009 aluminum hydrolysates with a low polymerization degree in flocs would undergo shared hydroxyl bridging reaction with the formation of hhs mid mer high mer and other high polymerization degree hydrolysates and then crystallize amorphous solids change into a more ordered phase which leads to an increase in the al o of al flocs zhang et al 2021b it can be assumed that a large amount of mhs monomer oligomer and low mer hydrolysates may exist in the flocs at the early stage of aging and further undergo hydroxyl bridging reaction to form hhs this hydroxyl bridging reaction may lead to the release of oh or consumption of h li et al 2019 and thus the ph plot shows an increasing trend in the early stage of floc aging figure s18 a b a broad peak at approximately 45 in al13 flocs is found in the xrd plot figure s19 which indicates the presence of either an amorphous phase small nanocrystals 10 nm or a semicrystalline mixture of both mossaad et al 2011 yu et al 2018 this peak disappears in the plots for alcl3 flocs al13 and al13agg have a nanoparticle structure with a radius from 2 5 to hundreds of nanometers gao et al 2009 and the flocs generated after coagulation would retain in a crystal structure similar to that of al13 lin et al 2009 in conclusion this peak could be attributed to the nanocrystals of al13 and al13agg as part of the al13 flocs would remain stable during aging while the mhs and amorphous al oh 3 may undergo further hydroxyl bridging linkage reactions and release oh less oh was released in the flocs of al13 figure s18 interestingly the oh released in nsio2 seems to be less in msio2 to obtain further information on the structure of flocs generated from msio2 and nsio2 we collected the flocs generated from net sio2 without organics with al based coagulants detailed experimental information is presented in text s4 and ftir and xps were conducted all four systems have massive peaks in the oh vibrational region 3500 cm 1 and the peak intensity of nsio2 is stronger than that of msio2 fig 6 a stronger peaks are found at 1640 cm 1 and 1000 1200 cm 1 in nsio2 fig 6 a indicating the adsorbed water on the floc surface and peaks in the region of hydration respectively yu et al 2018 the peak intensities of msio2 are weaker than those of nsio2 in both regions which indicates that more h2o is adsorbed on the surface of nsio2 the surface hydroxyl groups of mico sio2 and nano sio2 were determined text s5 to be 2 17 1019 counts g and 2 47 1020 counts g respectively implying that more exposure of nano sio2 leads to nsio2 flocs having stronger peaks in the oh vibrational region in addition the oh vibration peaks of msio2 flocs were redshifted during aging due to the dehydration crystallization of al oh 3am during aging yu et al 2018 and the hydroxyl bridging reaction may also cause dehydration leading to a redshift the redshift of malcl3 is more intense than that of mal13 indicating that more mhs transformed to hhs and more al oh 3 crystallization occurred during malcl3 floc aging the tiny peak of nsio2 flocs at 713 cm 1 represents the peak of al o 6 corresponding to al oh 3 crystal wu et al 2019 while msio2 flocs do not have a peak here the above phenomenon illustrates that mhs and al oh 3am would be formed first in msio2 and then undergo a hydroxyl bridging reaction and crystallize while more hhs and nano al oh 3cr crystallized al oh 3 may be directly produced in the nsio2 system and more h2o will be adsorbed onto the floc surface this also results in less oh release or h consumption in nsio2 than in msio2 the xps results show that the nsio2 flocs surface has a higher al o 2 si ratio the al o ratio of flocs with oxygen atoms excluded from silica better indicates the al o difference in al oh 3 which may also demonstrate that the nsio2 flocs contain more hhs or nanocrystals than msio2 the lower si content of msio2 in solution indicates that more msio2 is removed and enriched in flocs figure s20 it is surprising that the msio2 surface has a higher al si ratio than that of nsio2 which may be related to the primary nanoparticles produced by coagulation micro sio2 in msio2 may generate larger flocs by adsorption of primary nanoparticles on the surface while the flocs in nsio2 may form more homogeneous flocs by the collision and combination of nano sio2 and primary nanoparticles thus flocs with micro sio2 would possess higher al si and may produce more al oh active sites while flocs generated from nano sio2 would have lower al si and less al oh but more si oh fig 6 d shows that the binding energy of al beal increases during aging which means that al binds more tightly with other elements the increasing trend of beal is similar to the ph change curve the al13 curves show less variation than alcl3 curves and the nsio2 curves show less variation than msio2 curves which also confirms the hypothesis that mhs would further transform into more stable al species during aging in both msio2 and nsio2 the beal value and the change in beal of flocs generated by al13 are higher than those of flocs generated from alcl3 which proves that the flocs generated from al13 are more stable the initial nsio2 flocs 0 h possess a higher beal than msio2 flocs which further confirms that nano sio2 would promote the formation of more tightly bound al hydrolysates e g hhs and nano al oh 3cr and sio2 and al hydrolysate binding products the aged nsio2 flocs 120 h possess a lower beal than the aged msio2 flocs which may be due to the formation of abundant sio2 and al hydrolysate binding products that may possess a lower beal than tightly bound al hydrolysates 3 6 mechanism discussion fig 7 summarizes the probable mechanism of nom release and absorption during floc aging the flocs generated from al13 contain al13 nom al13agg nom and those generated from alcl3 contain al oh 3 nom and al oh 3 nom the mhs and al oh 3am in flocs undergo hydroxyl bridge linkage reactions mhs transform to hhs and then crystallize to form nano al oh 3cr previous studies have demonstrated that al13 is able to bind directly to ha to form precipitates at ph 6 0 9 0 while alcl3 binds ha through aluminum monomers al oh 3 and al oh 4 and the binding of aromatic ha to al13 is stronger than that to alcl3 zhao et al 2009 this results in more uv254 release in alcl3 flocs than in al13 flocs figure s2 b e on the other hand amorphous al oh 3 crystallizes and develops long range order by incorporating residual tetrahedral and pentahedral aluminum sites into octahedrally coordinated octahedral aluminum sites hu et al 2017 and the crystallinity of al oh 3 is inversely related to the occurrence of tetrahedral and pentahedral aluminum therefore flocs generated from al13 would slowly convert to al oh 3 wu et al 2008 and form crystals more slowly as al13 and al13agg al13 contains tetrahedral aluminum are stable while alcl3 flocs undergo a faster hydroxyl bridge reaction and further crystallization during aging li et al 2019 yu et al 2018 as a result the al atom would be transformed into a stable state higher beal during aging and there is less variation in beal for al13 the uv 2d cos results show that al13 and alcl3 flocs have similar nom release orders but the intensity of alcl3 release is higher than that of al13 combined with the results of uv254 and the aforementioned inferences the release of uv active substances may be attributed to the formation and release of hhs or nano al oh 3cr the abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of nano sio2 may facilitate the hydroxyl bridging reaction by providing hydrogen for consumption in the hydroxyl bridging reaction and thus more hhs and nano al oh 3cr are produced in nsio2 fig 6 consequently there is a difference in the organics release pattern between msio2 and nsio2 fig 1 as the polymerization degree increases and crystallization occurs flocs decrease in size and thus the nanoparticles in flocs would break free into water through brownian motion yu et al 2018 the residual al plot shows figure s20 that al decreases from 0 to 6 h which may be attributed to further sedimentation of the unsettled flocs in 30 min furthermore the residual al of the three systems shows an increasing trend from 6 to 120 h except for mal13 which would be attributed to the al oh 3cr breaking free from the flocs in addition these trends of residual al show a similar pattern to the change in uv254 which further indicates that the release or formation of nano al oh 3cr would lead to the release of uv254 active substances moreover nsio2 flocs with more hhs and crystals released more uv254 figure s2 the release of uv254 could be attributed to the high aromaticity of hs figures s10 11 and hs is able to bind to al oh 3cr and gradually wrap around al oh 3cr lu et al 1999 the adsorption of hs on the surface may not affect the crystallization of al oh 3 in the inner layer yu et al 2018 consequently some hs may be released into water with nano al oh 3cr as more hhs and nano al oh 3cr are generated in nsio2 more aromatic substances are released al13 yields stabler flocs than alcl3 and could be stably bound to nom which leads al13 to convert to al oh 3 more slowly thus releasing less hs than alcl3 flocs with several surface groups are able to bind with nom during aging especially protein like substances in msio2 flocs the abundant al hydrolysates provide ample al oh active groups on the surface which could further adsorb nom the nsio2 flocs would have more si oh but less al oh and adsorb abundant water onto the surface this layer of bound water may hinder the binding of nom with surface hydroxyl groups and the less al oh may reduce the activity to bind organics a previous study demonstrated that nano sio2 would produce denser flocs than micro sio2 during coagulation sun et al 2019 thus the adsorption capacity of flocs generated from nano sio2 for nom may be weaker than that of flocs generated from micro sio2 moreover the generation of hhs and nano al oh 3cr in nsio2 may lead to a reduction in the relative amount of active groups on the floc surface therefore the absorption of certain types of nom by nsio2 flocs is not insignificant as demonstrated by the results for protein like substances in 3deem and lwm n in lcocd and the fluctuating doc plot of nsio2 from the perspective of molecular chemical characteristics higher nosc and dbe o values may indicate higher polarity of molecules and this fraction is more easily released into the supernatant alternatively absorbed molecules may have lower polarity than the released molecules suggesting that less polar molecules may be further allocated to the hydrophobic domain in the floc during aging however the hydration layer and fewer active sites of nsio2 flocs may be disadvantageous for the further absorption of lower polarity molecules resulting in a fluctuating and smooth variation of doc in nsio2 from another perspective the content of octahedral aluminum which has a higher binding energy than tetrahedral aluminum an et al 2021 might increase with increasing beal during aging which might lead to an increase in al ligands and a decrease in electron density thus not allowing molecules with high polarity or negative charged hs or lwm a to bind to flocs stably 3 7 implication flocs will inevitably be generated after coagulation and some of these flocs will undergo the aging process e g in densadeg generated flocs will be returned to generate high density flocs and some of these returned flocs will be aging flocs this study revealed that hs substances which is an important disinfection byproduct precursor will be released into the water during floc aging thus the impact of hs substances needs to be considered when treating or refluxing floc supernatants for water containing many hydrophobic molecules the residence time of flocs could be increased appropriately which could optimize the flocs to further absorb organic matter and improve organic matter removal in water with a higher content of nanoparticles the flocs would possess more hhs crystals and adsorbed water resulting in reduced organic matter adsorption and the release of more hs during aging therefore when using water source with a high content of nanoparticles flocs should be discharged in a timely manner to avoid further hs release in addition the application of preoxidation coagulation processes is not recommended for water treatment processes involving floc aging due to the higher nosc of the organic matter released from aging flocs due to its stable structure and strong binding ability with nom al13 is a better coagulant to mitigate the release of organic matter from flocs since flocs generated from al13 release less hs during aging and could further absorb part of nom 4 conclusion the main conclusions of this paper are as follows 1 flocs absorb and release nom during aging the flocs generated from micron silica have a significant absorption effect for lwm n and protein like substances while the absorption of nom by flocs generated from nanosilica is insignificant hs with high aromaticity will be released from the experimental results of fticr ms the released nom has higher dbe o aimod and nosc than absorbed nom which means that high oxidation state and high double bond equivalent nom molecules are not easily absorbed by flocs and are easily released 2 flocs generated by al13 and alcl3 have similar uv active substance release patterns but different release intensities as flocs generated by al13 have higher stability and release fewer hs like substances during the aging process the release of nom may be correlated with the polymerization and crystallization of flocs and more hs is released with the increased polymerization and crystallization of flocs 3 flocs generated by micron silica have more active sites on the surface and a loose structure that can further adsorb nom while the flocs generated by nanosilica would be denser and have less al oh but more adsorbed water on the surface which is not conducive to the adsorption of nom supplementary material supporting information docx declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

15991,most studies on the interaction between coagulation and nom natural organic matter currently focus on pollutant removal and coagulant species distribution while studies on floc aging are lacking investigation onto the effects of floc aging could guide further processes that utilize flocs such as densadeg sludge recirculation floc predeposition for ultrafiltration sludge condensation and other traditional sludge reflux processes in this study flocs generated by al13 and alcl3 in microparticle and nanoparticle containing water were investigated and the effect of floc aging on nom was quantified based on several organic matter characterization techniques flocs absorb and release organics during aging the flocs generated from micro sio2 have a significant absorbing effect for lwm n low molecular weight neutral substances and protein like substances while the absorption of nom by flocs generated from nano sio2 is insignificant hs humic substances with high aromaticity are released during floc aging from the molecular perspective the molecules released during floc aging are those with higher double bond equivalents and higher aromaticity while the absorbed molecules are those with lower double bond equivalents and lower aromaticity 2d cos two dimensional correlation spectroscopy demonstrated that the flocs generated by al13 and alcl3 had the same organic release patterns but different intensities while the flocs generated in the micro sio2 and nano sio2 systems had different organics release patterns abundant aluminum hydrolysates with low polymerization and amorphous al oh 3 would be produced from alcl3 during the coagulation process and then undergo hydroxyl bridging reaction and crystallization during floc aging thus releasing more hs with high aromaticity into the supernatant in comparison prehydrolyzed al13 produces a more stable floc and releases less hs during aging the flocs produced by nano sio2 and al based coagulants release higher aromaticity hs into the water than those produced by micro sio2 which may be related to the formation of more highly polymerized degree hydrolysates and nanocrystalline al oh 3 in the nano sio2 system the flocs generated in water with micro sio2 may contain a large amount of al oh and have a loose structure thus further absorbing nom such as protein like substances and lwm n in contrast the flocs generated from nano sio2 possess abundant adsorbed water and a denser structure thus organic matter cannot be absorbed stably graphhical abstract image graphical abstract keywords al based coagulant al13 floc aging nom particle size 1 introduction coagulation is one of the most widely used water treatment processes in the world and it plays an important role in the removal of nom natural organic matter in water treatment huang et al 2014 among the investigations of nom removal by coagulation al aluminum based coagulants are the most widely studied the hydrolysis products of al based coagulants include monomers oligomers low mer mid mer high mer sol or gel and precipitates which can also be categorized into ala alb and alc by ferron time complexation spectrophotometry wang et al 2021 mechanisms for removing nom during coagulation can be different for various hydrolysis forms of aluminum yan et al 2008 and include complexation of ala electroneutralization of alb and sweeping of alc wang et al 2020 in water treatment processes not only is the coagulant important but the influence of the flocs cannot be ignored for example flocs are involved in densadeg sludge recirculation to accelerate water purification chen et al 2020 predeposited flocs to alleviate membrane fouling ma et al 2018 and sludge condensation and reflux in water supply plants moreover the effects of flocs on nom cannot be ignored as amorphous al oh 3 adsorbs or sweeps ha humic acids liu et al 2009 pommerenk and schafran 2005 yu et al 2010 it is worth noting that al oh 3 transforms from an amorphous form to a crystalline form during floc aging anderson and berkowitz 2010 wu et al 2019 yu et al 2018 during aging the surface area of al oh 3 decreases while the particle size distribution of the flocs becomes narrower berkowitz et al 2005 yu et al 2018 these changes will result in the release or absorption of contaminants for example it has been demonstrated that phosphorus removed by coagulation would be released during floc aging and the adsorption capacity of aged flocs for phosphorus will be reduced berkowitz et al 2006 in addition it has been demonstrated that floc aging will lead to greater membrane fouling in the process of coagulation membrane to remove ha yu et al 2019 due to the aging effect the adsorption capacity of al oh 3 for ha will be reduced wu et al 2019 and the ability to alleviate membrane fouling and the ha removal efficiency are also reduced during floc deposition on ultrafiltration membranes ma et al 2018 these phenomena can be detrimental and could cause secondary contaminantion if not handled properly al13 and alcl3 are two representative al based coagulants where al13 is the stable al prehydrolysis product yue et al 2021 these two coagulants show different nom removal mechanisms and the flocs generated from al13 and alcl3 are composed of different components flocs generated by al13 mainly contain al13 al13agg al13 aggregates al oh 3 and other hydrolysates while flocs generated by alcl3 mainly contain al oh 3 and hydrolysates tang et al 2015 zhao et al 2008 therefore the flocs produced by the two coagulants may differ during floc aging and nom absorption and release may also differ however research on floc aging is still lacking and knowledge of the effect of flocs on nom during aging is almost absent the interaction between nom and coagulants includes many chemical and physical processes wang et al 2021 moreover the related processes during floc aging are not clear which may lead to the release and absorption of nom investigation of the variations in nom during floc aging would be helpful to further clarify the interaction mechanism between coagulants and organic matter to optimize coagulation as well as the combination process to determine the optimal time for sludge discharge and recirculation and to provide a new perspective for coagulation in addition to the coagulant al species distribution the particle size affects the floc properties sun et al 2019 e g flocs generated by micro sio2 particles have a lower fractal dimension but a higher strength factor and recovery factor than flocs generated by nano sio2 particles sun et al 2019 in a coagulation experiment involving al based coagulants and ha nano tio2 synthetic water the interaction of ha with nano tio2 in the water made precipitation more difficult xu et al 2014 and an increase in nano tio2 led to loose flocs fan et al 2018 under such conditions particle size may change the release and absorption of nom during floc aging in this paper floc aging studies were conducted on microparticle nom synthetic water and nanoparticle nom synthetic water using two representative al based coagulants alcl3 and al13 considered to be the most active ingredients in polyaluminum chloride yue et al 2021 this study mainly aimed to investigate 1 the change pattern of nom during floc aging and 2 the effects of different particle sizes on the release and absorption of nom the nom components of the supernatant during aging were fully identified using uv vis spectroscopy 3deem three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy lcocd liquid chromatography organic carbon detection and fticr ms fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to analyze the relationship between the release and absorption of nom during floc aging the flocs were also characterized by xrd x ray diffraction ftir fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy to observe the changes that occurred in flocs during the aging process 2 materials and methods 2 1 coagulants and synthetic raw water the alcl3 coagulant was prepared from alcl3 6h2o ar sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd al13 was prepared in our lab and detailed information is described in a previous report an et al 2021 alcl3 and al13 stock solutions were prepared at a concentration of 0 1 mol l micro sio2 powder 10 μm shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd and nano sio2 powder 15 nm shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd were selected for use as micro and nano particles respectively the micro and nano sio2 stock suspensions were prepared at a concentration of 1 5 g l which were stirred at high speed for 3 h and sonicated for 120 min to fully disperse detailed information about the physicochemical properties of micro sio2 and nano sio2 is presented in text s1 and figure s1 raw water was obtained from yiwu city jinhua city zhejiang province china to remove the complex particulate matter from the surface water and reduce the effects of microorganisms the raw water was passed through a 0 45 μm membrane and then a certain amount of sio2 stock suspension was added to prepare the synthetic raw water the particulate matter in the synthetic raw water was 50 mg l and the ph was 7 3 7 5 detailed information on the physicochemical characteristics of the synthetic raw water is listed in table s3 2 2 supernatant and flocs the coagulation procedure was carried out as follows 1 min of rapid stirring at 200 r min to was performed to stabilize the water sample 0 1 mmol l coagulant was then added and the stirring rate of 200 r min was maintained for 1 5 min to adequately mix the coagulant and water sample then flocs were continuously generated by 10 min of slow stirring at 40 r min and the sample was finally allowed to settle for 30 min after coagulation cling film was used to seal the beakers to prevent evaporation of the supernatant and interference from carbon dioxide in the air coagulation experiments were conducted in 500 ml beakers on a meiyu coagulation test stirrer my3000 6 n at ambient room temperature the coagulation experiments of micro sio2 and nano sio2 with al13 and alcl3 produced four different systems called mal13 malcl3 nal13 and nalcl3 respectively additionally msio2 and nsio2 represent the micro sio2 system and nano sio2 system aging times were set at 0 2 6 12 24 48 72 96 and 120 h as previous studies demonstrated that the ph of the supernatant during floc aging varies drastically from 0 to 24 h and plateaus after 100 h anderson 2004 anderson and berkowitz 2010 to avoid changes in the aging environment caused by sampling each independent coagulation experiment was performed only once when the aging time was reached the supernatant was immediately collected at 2 cm below the water surface to determine its ph fe28 mettler toledo and a certain amount of supernatant was taken and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for subsequent measurements flocs were obtained through filtration of the remaining liquid in the beaker and stored in a dark dry environment after air drying three parallel experiments were conducted for each batch of experiments 2 3 analytical methods to obtain comprehensive insight into the release and absorption pattern of organic matter during floc aging the supernatant was passed through a 0 45 μm membrane and then nom was determined by total organic carbon analysis toc l cpn shimadzu japan uv vis spectrophotometry tu 1810 persee 3deem f 7000 fl spectrophotometer and lcocd doc labor to better observe the changes in organic matter during aging uv vis measurements were performed using a 5 cm cuvette with a scanning wavelength of 190 600 nm 2d cos two dimensional correlation spectroscopy was applied to analyze the changes in uv active substances the instrument parameters for 3deem were as follows the wavenumbers for excitation and emission light were 200 400 nm and 220 550 nm respectively with a resolution of 5 nm the pmt photomultiplier tube voltage was 700 v and the scan speed was 60 000 nm min parafac parallel factor analysis and hix humification index were applied to calculate and analyze 3deem data information about the 2d cos and 3deem data processing methods are presented in text s2 and text s3 respectively to gain molecular insight the supernatant was subjected to fticr ms bruker solarix after solid phase extraction agilent bond elut ppl detailed information on fticr ms is presented in text s4 xrd rigaku ultima iv was used to investigate the changes in floc crystallization during aging and the scanning angle range was 5 90 with a 2 min scanning speed residual aluminum and silica were determined by measuring the supernatant after microwave digestion using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7700 ftir thermo scientific nicolet is20 and xps thermo scientific k alpha were applied to analyze the surface of net flocs generated from coagulant and net silica only 3 results and discussion 3 1 doc and uv vis analysis in msio2 alcl3 has a greater nom removal than al13 figure s2 a b c d which may be attributed to the rapid hydrolysis of ala and the generation of abundant al oh 3 tending to absorb more nom the uv254 plots figure s2 b e show that flocs release uv254 active substances and flocs generated from alcl3 release more uv254 material during aging the doc dissolved organic matter plot of msio2 shows a decreasing tendency while the doc plot of nsio2 shows smooth volatility as shown in figure s2 c f suva254 has an increasing trend in all four aging experiments this further indicates that the flocs may absorb some of the non uv254 active substances while some uv254 substances removed by coagulation are released in the aging process to derive the release mechanism of uv active substances in the four different systems we used uv 2d cos to explore the changes fig 1 a c e g are the uv synchronous correlation spectra of mal13 malcl3 nal13 and nalcl3 respectively which show no cross peak but intense auto peaks in the range of 194 201 nm mal13 and malcl3 and 198 204 nm nal13 and nalcl3 the auto peak indicates that the uv absorbance consistently increases at a specific range of wavelengths phong and hur 2016 the intensity of synchronous auto peaks could be related to the sensitivity of the external perturbation to the spectrum mee jung and noda 2006 phong and hur 2016 e g the sensitivity of floc aging time to the release of uv active organics in this paper by comparison of fig 1 a c and fig 1 e g alcl3 floc is more affected by aging time than al13 flocs and the nom release sensitivity of nsio2 is higher than that of msio2 which illustrates that more uv active substances would be released in the presence of nanoparticles corresponding to the results in figure s2 asynchronous spectra reveal the sequence of changes in external vibrations at different wavelengths chen and yu 2021 hur et al 2011 according to the results of asynchronous spectra fig 1 b d f h two specified wavelength bands were selected for comparison and it was found that the change at 255 275 nm preceded that at 195 215 nm previous studies demonstrated a correlation between 250 and 280 nm uv absorption and electronic transitions in aromatic structures in ha and fa fulvic acid such as phenolic compounds benzoic acid and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons chin et al 1994 hur et al 2011 therefore substances with aromatic structures are released before substances with lower wavelength absorption during aging and aromatic ha may become more unstable in binding to al oh 3 than substances with lower wavelength absorption during aging different cross peaks were identified such as 197 190 and 230 197 in mal13 190 195 and 231 197 in malcl3 202 191 220 220 230 220 260 200 and 260 230 in nal13 and 205 191 230 210 and 255 230 in nalcl3 specific wavelength peaks were selected from the cross peak to analyze the release of uv active organics release in the micro sio2 system and the nano sio2 system shows that the sequence of change in msio2 is 255 230 197 190 while that in nsio2 is 255 210 230 191 this finding indicates that al13 and alcl3 release uv active organics in a similar pattern while the flocs generated from msio2 and nsio2 release organics with a different pattern therefore it is necessary to consider not only the type of coagulants but also the particle size in water treatment processes involving floc aging as the patterns of release of organic matter are different for different particle sizes 3 2 3deem to gain further insight into the changes in organic components 3deem was applied to characterize the nom in supernatant and the results are shown in figures s3 6 fig 2 a h shows that the fluorescence intensity of msio2 decreases during aging whlie the fluorescence intensity of nsio2 changes little which is comparable to the doc results parafac was applied to analyze the 3deem data of msio2 and nsio2 stedmon and bro 2008 four similar components were identified and the results are shown in fig 2 k n the component loading plots of the components for the two systems are presented in figure s7 the four components are named c1 c2 c3 and c4 which can be mainly classified as fa ha aromatic protein ii tryptophan like protein substances and aromatic protein i complexes and its protein like substances respectively chen et al 2003 as shown in fig 2 i mal13 could absorb c1 c3 and c4 significantly during aging but not c2 in malcl3 the changes in c1 c3 and c4 components are similar to those in mal13 but the c2 component shows an increasing tendency this indicates that the malcl3 flocs release ha like substances while some fa and protein like substances are further removed by the flocs in nsio2 c1 and c2 show a tendency to increase in the early stage and then become smooth while the variation in c3 and c4 fluctuations these variations are consistent with the trend for doc in nsio2 but differ from the trend in uv results this may indicate that fluorescence active substances may not be the main substances that are consistently released but rather uv active substances moreover initially released ha and fa like substances are mainly fluorescence active to further characterize the humification of nom hix was applied to estimate the humification level of nom figure s8 zheng et al 2022 the patterns of hix variation follow similar patterns to uv in msio2 alcl3 flocs are more likely to release highly humified organic matter while al13 is more stable and less variable in nsio2 the flocs formed by both coagulants show a pattern of releasing humified organic matter first and then smoothly combinind these results with figure s2 it could be suggests that the released uv active organic matter is the organic matter with a higher degree of humification incorporating the above findings further suggests that the uv active organic matter released during aging consists of those with a high degree of humification e g fa and ha this conclusion agrees with the previous conclusion that the flocs can bind some of the ha stably in mal13 spearman correlation analysis was used to statistically analyze the indicators during aging fig 3 ar the absorbance ratio of uv254 and uv203 is positively correlated with the aromaticity of nom zha et al 2018 the ar change plot during aging is presented in figure s9 most of the mal13 and malcl3 statistical indicators show a significant correlation pattern while most of the indicators in nsio2 show no significant correlation relationship therefore flocs in nsio2 seem to have an unclear pattern of nom release and absorption there is a significant positive correlation between ph and uv254 in the four systems in addition there is a significant negative correlation between doc and ar indicating that the absorbed organics are lower aromaticity nom while the released organics are higher aromaticity nom although c1 and c2 belong to hs they show a negative correlation with hix except for c2 in malcl3 these results further indicate that the released ha and fa are more humified and aromatic while the lower humified and aromatic ha and fa are further absorbed it is worth noting that the change in uv254 in the mal13 system is not drastic which corresponds to the lower release of humified and aromatic organic matter 3 3 lcocd to obtain precise information on the release and absorption of organic matter during floc aging lcocd was applied lcocd provides a comprehensive characterization of nom components such as biopolymers bps aquatic humics hs building blocks bb low molecular weight lmw neutrals lwm n and lmw acids lwm a and more accurate information on their molecular weight and aromaticity can be obtained by tandem liquid chromatography with organic carbon detector ocd uv254 detector uvd and organic nitrogen detector ond villacorte 2014 the lcocd results are presented in figures s10 11 hs at a retention time of 21 5 min shows a distinct increasing trend in the uvd curves which proves that the released hs is the dominant uv active matter bps show a pattern of increasing in 0 6 h but decreasing in 6 120 h in msio2 flocs fig 4 a b hs generally increases from 18 0 to 21 in mal13 and from 12 6 to 24 8 in malcl3 during aging with its aromaticity generally increasing from 2 54 to 2 63 l mg m in mal13 and 2 10 to 2 86 l mg m in malcl3 this implies that nom released during floc aging is mainly hs with high aromaticity which is consistent with section 3 2 for lwms low molecular weight substances the percentages of bb and lwm a in the supernatant increased from 10 1 to 11 4 and 18 5 to 19 7 in mal13 respectively and from 10 0 to 12 and 14 5 to 19 2 in malcl3 with lwm n showing a drastic decreasing trend from 50 8 to 42 0 in mal13 and from 53 5 to 39 6 in malcl3 fig 4 a b considering these results in conjunction with the fig 2 and lcocd plots the absorbed molecules may be the protein like substances with small molecular weights furthermore lwm n has a greater decrease which means that lwm n is the main substance absorbed during aging in msio2 regarding release hs is the dominant released substances followed by bb and lwm a in nsio2 the content and ratio of bps and hs fluctuate during aging fig 4 c d for the lwms lwm n changes with less variation which indicates that nsio2 flocs may not be conducive to the absorption of macromolecules and lwm n although the hs content does not change significantly in ocd the uvd shows an increasing trend in the hs region figure s11 and their aromaticity generally increases from 2 77 to 3 46 l mg m in nal13 and 2 46 to 3 53 l mg m in nalcl3 moreover the hs released in nsio2 has higher aromaticity than that released in msio2 these results are related to 3deem and uv which further demonstrate that the increased uv absorbance is attributed to the release of hs with high aromaticity and humification 3 4 fticr ms fticr ms was applied to characterize nom at the molecular level and detailed information about fticr ms is presented in the text s4 and figures s12 13 fig 5 shows the molecular density distribution of the van krevelen diagram and nosc vs dbe o c plots of malcl3 nosc is the nominal oxidation state of carbon which could indicate that the carbon atoms per molecule are in a reduced state deb o is the oxygen extracted double bond equivalent which could indicate the unsaturation degree of the carbon skeleton ma et al 2021 comparing fig 5 a b the absorbed and released of nom mainly consists of molecules in ligins and car condensed aromatics which are mainly distributed in the intervals of o c 0 675 and h c 1 5 and released molecules have a much lower h c than absorbed molecules in fig 5 c d zone 1 zone 2 zone 3 and zone 4 represent nom with oxidized and unsaturated properties reduced and unsaturated properties reduced and saturated properties and oxidized and saturated properties respectively zhang et al 2021a there is a difference between the molecules released and absorbed by aging with most of the absorbed nom in zone 3 and the released nom in zone 1 which indicates that the flocs prefer to absorb reduced and saturated nom and release oxidized and unsaturated nom the distribution of nom shifts from zone 2 3 to zone 1 4 which reveals that molecules in the oxidized state may not be well absorbed and that absorbed oxidized nom may have some risk of release the fticr ms data for mal13 nal13 and nalcl3 are presented in figures s15 17 their molecular distributions are similar to that of malcl3 with released and absorbed molecules mainly distributed in ligins and car although no significant difference was found in the density distribution of nosc vs dbe o c the average values of dbe o and nosc confirms that the released nom has higher values of dbe o and nosc indicating that unsaturated and oxidized nom are more easily released during aging the nosc vs dbe o c plots for released nom in the four systems show a weak peak in zone 2 0 50 deb o c 0 75 0 5 nosc 0 which may be part of the highly unsaturated nom corresponding to the van krevelen plot of car this indicates that car with a high dbe o value belongs to nom which is easily released during aging in comparison with aimod indicating aromaticity the average aimod of the released molecules is higher than that of the absorbed molecules in the four systems as a result the released molecules are those with a higher double bond content and aromaticity while the absorbed molecules are those with lower double bond equivalents and lower aromaticity which leads to an increase in uv absorbance in the supernatant 3 5 flocs figure s18 shows that ph would rise and then stabilize during aging which is consistent with previous studies anderson 2004 anderson and berkowitz 2010 berkowitz et al 2005 the origin supernatant ph curves figure s18 a b are more volatile than the filtered ones figure s18 c d which indicates that the flocs would release alkaline substances to the supernatant during aging as shown in figure s18 a b al13 flocs show fewer ph shifts which means that alcl3 flocs released more alkaline substances during aging than al13 flocs al13 medium polymer mainly produces al13 al13agg al oh 3 and other hydrolysates during coagulation while alcl3 mainly produces al oh 3 and hydrolysates wu et al 2019 zhao et al 2009 aluminum hydrolysates with a low polymerization degree in flocs would undergo shared hydroxyl bridging reaction with the formation of hhs mid mer high mer and other high polymerization degree hydrolysates and then crystallize amorphous solids change into a more ordered phase which leads to an increase in the al o of al flocs zhang et al 2021b it can be assumed that a large amount of mhs monomer oligomer and low mer hydrolysates may exist in the flocs at the early stage of aging and further undergo hydroxyl bridging reaction to form hhs this hydroxyl bridging reaction may lead to the release of oh or consumption of h li et al 2019 and thus the ph plot shows an increasing trend in the early stage of floc aging figure s18 a b a broad peak at approximately 45 in al13 flocs is found in the xrd plot figure s19 which indicates the presence of either an amorphous phase small nanocrystals 10 nm or a semicrystalline mixture of both mossaad et al 2011 yu et al 2018 this peak disappears in the plots for alcl3 flocs al13 and al13agg have a nanoparticle structure with a radius from 2 5 to hundreds of nanometers gao et al 2009 and the flocs generated after coagulation would retain in a crystal structure similar to that of al13 lin et al 2009 in conclusion this peak could be attributed to the nanocrystals of al13 and al13agg as part of the al13 flocs would remain stable during aging while the mhs and amorphous al oh 3 may undergo further hydroxyl bridging linkage reactions and release oh less oh was released in the flocs of al13 figure s18 interestingly the oh released in nsio2 seems to be less in msio2 to obtain further information on the structure of flocs generated from msio2 and nsio2 we collected the flocs generated from net sio2 without organics with al based coagulants detailed experimental information is presented in text s4 and ftir and xps were conducted all four systems have massive peaks in the oh vibrational region 3500 cm 1 and the peak intensity of nsio2 is stronger than that of msio2 fig 6 a stronger peaks are found at 1640 cm 1 and 1000 1200 cm 1 in nsio2 fig 6 a indicating the adsorbed water on the floc surface and peaks in the region of hydration respectively yu et al 2018 the peak intensities of msio2 are weaker than those of nsio2 in both regions which indicates that more h2o is adsorbed on the surface of nsio2 the surface hydroxyl groups of mico sio2 and nano sio2 were determined text s5 to be 2 17 1019 counts g and 2 47 1020 counts g respectively implying that more exposure of nano sio2 leads to nsio2 flocs having stronger peaks in the oh vibrational region in addition the oh vibration peaks of msio2 flocs were redshifted during aging due to the dehydration crystallization of al oh 3am during aging yu et al 2018 and the hydroxyl bridging reaction may also cause dehydration leading to a redshift the redshift of malcl3 is more intense than that of mal13 indicating that more mhs transformed to hhs and more al oh 3 crystallization occurred during malcl3 floc aging the tiny peak of nsio2 flocs at 713 cm 1 represents the peak of al o 6 corresponding to al oh 3 crystal wu et al 2019 while msio2 flocs do not have a peak here the above phenomenon illustrates that mhs and al oh 3am would be formed first in msio2 and then undergo a hydroxyl bridging reaction and crystallize while more hhs and nano al oh 3cr crystallized al oh 3 may be directly produced in the nsio2 system and more h2o will be adsorbed onto the floc surface this also results in less oh release or h consumption in nsio2 than in msio2 the xps results show that the nsio2 flocs surface has a higher al o 2 si ratio the al o ratio of flocs with oxygen atoms excluded from silica better indicates the al o difference in al oh 3 which may also demonstrate that the nsio2 flocs contain more hhs or nanocrystals than msio2 the lower si content of msio2 in solution indicates that more msio2 is removed and enriched in flocs figure s20 it is surprising that the msio2 surface has a higher al si ratio than that of nsio2 which may be related to the primary nanoparticles produced by coagulation micro sio2 in msio2 may generate larger flocs by adsorption of primary nanoparticles on the surface while the flocs in nsio2 may form more homogeneous flocs by the collision and combination of nano sio2 and primary nanoparticles thus flocs with micro sio2 would possess higher al si and may produce more al oh active sites while flocs generated from nano sio2 would have lower al si and less al oh but more si oh fig 6 d shows that the binding energy of al beal increases during aging which means that al binds more tightly with other elements the increasing trend of beal is similar to the ph change curve the al13 curves show less variation than alcl3 curves and the nsio2 curves show less variation than msio2 curves which also confirms the hypothesis that mhs would further transform into more stable al species during aging in both msio2 and nsio2 the beal value and the change in beal of flocs generated by al13 are higher than those of flocs generated from alcl3 which proves that the flocs generated from al13 are more stable the initial nsio2 flocs 0 h possess a higher beal than msio2 flocs which further confirms that nano sio2 would promote the formation of more tightly bound al hydrolysates e g hhs and nano al oh 3cr and sio2 and al hydrolysate binding products the aged nsio2 flocs 120 h possess a lower beal than the aged msio2 flocs which may be due to the formation of abundant sio2 and al hydrolysate binding products that may possess a lower beal than tightly bound al hydrolysates 3 6 mechanism discussion fig 7 summarizes the probable mechanism of nom release and absorption during floc aging the flocs generated from al13 contain al13 nom al13agg nom and those generated from alcl3 contain al oh 3 nom and al oh 3 nom the mhs and al oh 3am in flocs undergo hydroxyl bridge linkage reactions mhs transform to hhs and then crystallize to form nano al oh 3cr previous studies have demonstrated that al13 is able to bind directly to ha to form precipitates at ph 6 0 9 0 while alcl3 binds ha through aluminum monomers al oh 3 and al oh 4 and the binding of aromatic ha to al13 is stronger than that to alcl3 zhao et al 2009 this results in more uv254 release in alcl3 flocs than in al13 flocs figure s2 b e on the other hand amorphous al oh 3 crystallizes and develops long range order by incorporating residual tetrahedral and pentahedral aluminum sites into octahedrally coordinated octahedral aluminum sites hu et al 2017 and the crystallinity of al oh 3 is inversely related to the occurrence of tetrahedral and pentahedral aluminum therefore flocs generated from al13 would slowly convert to al oh 3 wu et al 2008 and form crystals more slowly as al13 and al13agg al13 contains tetrahedral aluminum are stable while alcl3 flocs undergo a faster hydroxyl bridge reaction and further crystallization during aging li et al 2019 yu et al 2018 as a result the al atom would be transformed into a stable state higher beal during aging and there is less variation in beal for al13 the uv 2d cos results show that al13 and alcl3 flocs have similar nom release orders but the intensity of alcl3 release is higher than that of al13 combined with the results of uv254 and the aforementioned inferences the release of uv active substances may be attributed to the formation and release of hhs or nano al oh 3cr the abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of nano sio2 may facilitate the hydroxyl bridging reaction by providing hydrogen for consumption in the hydroxyl bridging reaction and thus more hhs and nano al oh 3cr are produced in nsio2 fig 6 consequently there is a difference in the organics release pattern between msio2 and nsio2 fig 1 as the polymerization degree increases and crystallization occurs flocs decrease in size and thus the nanoparticles in flocs would break free into water through brownian motion yu et al 2018 the residual al plot shows figure s20 that al decreases from 0 to 6 h which may be attributed to further sedimentation of the unsettled flocs in 30 min furthermore the residual al of the three systems shows an increasing trend from 6 to 120 h except for mal13 which would be attributed to the al oh 3cr breaking free from the flocs in addition these trends of residual al show a similar pattern to the change in uv254 which further indicates that the release or formation of nano al oh 3cr would lead to the release of uv254 active substances moreover nsio2 flocs with more hhs and crystals released more uv254 figure s2 the release of uv254 could be attributed to the high aromaticity of hs figures s10 11 and hs is able to bind to al oh 3cr and gradually wrap around al oh 3cr lu et al 1999 the adsorption of hs on the surface may not affect the crystallization of al oh 3 in the inner layer yu et al 2018 consequently some hs may be released into water with nano al oh 3cr as more hhs and nano al oh 3cr are generated in nsio2 more aromatic substances are released al13 yields stabler flocs than alcl3 and could be stably bound to nom which leads al13 to convert to al oh 3 more slowly thus releasing less hs than alcl3 flocs with several surface groups are able to bind with nom during aging especially protein like substances in msio2 flocs the abundant al hydrolysates provide ample al oh active groups on the surface which could further adsorb nom the nsio2 flocs would have more si oh but less al oh and adsorb abundant water onto the surface this layer of bound water may hinder the binding of nom with surface hydroxyl groups and the less al oh may reduce the activity to bind organics a previous study demonstrated that nano sio2 would produce denser flocs than micro sio2 during coagulation sun et al 2019 thus the adsorption capacity of flocs generated from nano sio2 for nom may be weaker than that of flocs generated from micro sio2 moreover the generation of hhs and nano al oh 3cr in nsio2 may lead to a reduction in the relative amount of active groups on the floc surface therefore the absorption of certain types of nom by nsio2 flocs is not insignificant as demonstrated by the results for protein like substances in 3deem and lwm n in lcocd and the fluctuating doc plot of nsio2 from the perspective of molecular chemical characteristics higher nosc and dbe o values may indicate higher polarity of molecules and this fraction is more easily released into the supernatant alternatively absorbed molecules may have lower polarity than the released molecules suggesting that less polar molecules may be further allocated to the hydrophobic domain in the floc during aging however the hydration layer and fewer active sites of nsio2 flocs may be disadvantageous for the further absorption of lower polarity molecules resulting in a fluctuating and smooth variation of doc in nsio2 from another perspective the content of octahedral aluminum which has a higher binding energy than tetrahedral aluminum an et al 2021 might increase with increasing beal during aging which might lead to an increase in al ligands and a decrease in electron density thus not allowing molecules with high polarity or negative charged hs or lwm a to bind to flocs stably 3 7 implication flocs will inevitably be generated after coagulation and some of these flocs will undergo the aging process e g in densadeg generated flocs will be returned to generate high density flocs and some of these returned flocs will be aging flocs this study revealed that hs substances which is an important disinfection byproduct precursor will be released into the water during floc aging thus the impact of hs substances needs to be considered when treating or refluxing floc supernatants for water containing many hydrophobic molecules the residence time of flocs could be increased appropriately which could optimize the flocs to further absorb organic matter and improve organic matter removal in water with a higher content of nanoparticles the flocs would possess more hhs crystals and adsorbed water resulting in reduced organic matter adsorption and the release of more hs during aging therefore when using water source with a high content of nanoparticles flocs should be discharged in a timely manner to avoid further hs release in addition the application of preoxidation coagulation processes is not recommended for water treatment processes involving floc aging due to the higher nosc of the organic matter released from aging flocs due to its stable structure and strong binding ability with nom al13 is a better coagulant to mitigate the release of organic matter from flocs since flocs generated from al13 release less hs during aging and could further absorb part of nom 4 conclusion the main conclusions of this paper are as follows 1 flocs absorb and release nom during aging the flocs generated from micron silica have a significant absorption effect for lwm n and protein like substances while the absorption of nom by flocs generated from nanosilica is insignificant hs with high aromaticity will be released from the experimental results of fticr ms the released nom has higher dbe o aimod and nosc than absorbed nom which means that high oxidation state and high double bond equivalent nom molecules are not easily absorbed by flocs and are easily released 2 flocs generated by al13 and alcl3 have similar uv active substance release patterns but different release intensities as flocs generated by al13 have higher stability and release fewer hs like substances during the aging process the release of nom may be correlated with the polymerization and crystallization of flocs and more hs is released with the increased polymerization and crystallization of flocs 3 flocs generated by micron silica have more active sites on the surface and a loose structure that can further adsorb nom while the flocs generated by nanosilica would be denser and have less al oh but more adsorbed water on the surface which is not conducive to the adsorption of nom supplementary material supporting information docx declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

15992,during the millennium drought in southeast australia 2001 2009 dryland wetlands experienced widespread ecological deterioration which highlighted their vulnerability to natural climate variability and the potential effects of drying climate change here we use 30 year observed streamflow data 1991 2020 and numerical models to assess the impacts of climate variability and climate change on the macquarie marshes the marshes a large floodplain wetland complex in the semi arid region of new south wales australia a fast ecohydrologic emulator based on network linear programming with side constraints was developed to simulate the spatial and temporal responses of different wetland vegetation types to water regime the emulator represents the wetland by a series of inter connected level pool reservoirs with the volume discharge relationship obtained from a calibrated quasi 2d hydrodynamic model the emulator reproduces daily flows and volume with good accuracy nash sutcliffe statistic ranging from 0 61 to 0 96 with 1 26 000 of the computational effort we use the emulator to simulate the potential effects of climatic variability on vegetation by running the model over 30 years of observed data and 1000 statistically representative 30 year streamflow time series which were generated using a stochastic model calibrated to the gauged flows the collection of results for all 1000 contemporary simulations indicates the marshes experience severe conditions 43 18 of the time in a 30 year period we then ran an additional 6000 simulations to assess the combined impacts of climate variability and future climate change at the end of the century for the driest future climates 60 and 30 reduction in runoff the marshes remain in severe condition 89 6 and 63 16 of the time respectively while no major differences with respect to the contemporary conditions were found for the wetter future our results highlight the importance of quantifying the extent and uncertainty in the degradation of these ecosystems due to climate variability and change for informing management decisions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wetlands climate change emulator network linear programming 1 introduction large floodplain wetlands in arid and semiarid regions are an essential environmental asset for sustaining regional biodiversity they support a wide range of biota such as flood dependant vegetation roberts and marston 2011 waterbirds kingsford and auld 2005 fish rayner et al 2015 and amphibians ocock et al 2014 because they rely on episodic inundation from upstream catchments these wetlands are often under stress due to competition with other water uses such as agriculture human and livestock consumption and industrial use during the millennium drought in southeast australia 2001 2009 dryland wetlands had to endure some of the most severe conditions in terms of water scarcity in over a hundred years resulting in widespread ecological deterioration van dijk et al 2013 most of the wetlands recovered in subsequent wet years but the drought highlighted the vulnerability of these ecosystems to natural climate variability and also to the potential effects of climate change climate change may worsen the stress on wetlands due an increase in evaporation and anthropogenic water demands higher evaporation and lower inflows to floodplain wetlands are expected to reduce flooding frequency and increase the severity of droughts that will affect plant species distribution community structure and hydro morphological dynamics junk et al 2013 saintilan et al 2021a 2021b in southern australia a decrease in the magnitude frequency and duration of floods has been observed for the period 1975 2012 gu et al 2020 which may have been exacerbated by climate change severe droughts are likely to damage wetland s ecosystem functions and services such as water supply improvement of water quality and maintenance of biodiversity by 2100 at least 6000 km2 of inland wetlands around the world are expected to be lost due climate change xi et al 2021 assessment of the impacts of climate change on dryland wetlands requires in depth understanding of the response of different vegetation types with different water requirements to varying flow conditions hydrodynamic models are commonly used to study wetland water dynamics garcia et al 2015 marsooli et al 2016 popescu et al 2015 wester et al 2018 and its links to vegetation hydrological preferences models have been implemented to improve estimation of hydrological fluxes analyse wetland connectivity support decision making and predict impacts of anthropogenic activity e g water extraction pollution land use or climate change karim et al 2012 morrissey et al 2021 saco et al 2018 2020 wester et al 2018 in addition studies have used models to analyse the effect of climate change on wetlands by considering scenarios of wetter and drier future predicted climates fu et al 2015 johnson et al 2005 sandi et al 2020a however due to their complexity and computational demands numerical models have been limited in their capacity to incorporate natural climate variability including stochastic extreme events such as drought and flood or climate change because of the requirements for assessing a large number of scenarios simulations as ecosystems in arid and semiarid areas are particularly sensitive and vulnerable to climate variability cleverly et al 2019 huang et al 2017 wen and saintilan 2015 this last point has been a strong limitation for predictions of wetland response to future climate even though the algorithms in hydrodynamic models have improved and computer processors have rapidly evolved the computational cost to run such models remains a substantial constraint limiting the number and scope of scenarios that can be simulated simulation times can be in the range of hours to days neal et al 2018 nguyen et al 2021 wilson et al 2007 yang et al 2012 depending on the spatial and temporal resolutions size of the simulation domain simulation length and computer characteristics additionally hydrodynamic models require a considerable amount of information bathymetry digital elevation models land use maps for roughness coefficients upstream and downstream hydrological information and generate huge volumes of results furthermore when hydrodynamic models include vegetation dynamics best et al 2018 sandi et al 2020a the number of input and output files and the complexity of the model increase given these time constraints conventional ecohydrological models are unable to evaluate in a meaningful way the inherent uncertainty in the predictions of the vulnerability of wetlands to future climate change practical analysis of the impacts of climate change and climate variability through scenario comparison requires a fast model that can emulate vegetation water dynamics of dryland wetlands emulators use algebraic functions of the variables of interest to represent physical phenomena instead of complex physically based equations giselle fernández godino et al 2019 emulators have been implemented to reduce runtimes in computationally expensive models peherstorfer et al 2018 and have been applied in hydrology hall et al 2011 zhou et al 2021 aerospace engineering brevault et al 2020 and other areas emulators have also been used as part of water resources optimisation frameworks in which many scenarios tens of thousands must be run in order to explore all possible solutions for example cui et al 2014 used network linear programming to emulate the complex gnangara groundwater system that is part of perth s water supply a 40 cpu h modflow simulation was reduced to a 1 cpu s emulated simulation with monthly flux standard errors of 10 to 15 here we use a network linear program with side constraints nlp s ecohydrologic emulator for a large dryland floodplain wetland the macquarie marshes a ramsar wetland of international significance in semi arid new south wales australia we use our emulator to investigate the effects of climate variability and change on vegetation condition and in particular to address the question how does the uncertainty in the natural variability and the projected climate change scenarios affects the predictions of wetland ecohydrological response the emulator is built within wathnet5 kuczera et al 2009 a tool that has been widely used to manage water supply networks kibria and maheswaran 2012 kuczera 1992 singh and ibbitt 2018 wathnet5 has the advantage that it can incorporate side constraints which are used to describe the complex dynamics of the system it also allows for the incorporation of user defined algorithms to analyse other water dependent ecohydrologic variables like the response of wetland vegetation to frequency duration and depth of inundation roberts and marston 2011 sandi et al 2019 the emulator is developed using vegetation observations bowen et al 2017 wilson 1992 and numerical simulations of flow and vegetation response sandi et al 2020b in the macquarie marshes during a 30 year period 1991 2020 that included the millennium drought we use the emulator to simulate the expected effects of climate variability by running 1000 statistically representative streamflow time series with different flow frequencies and magnitude generated using an autoregressive model based on the 30 years of river flow records we then run an additional 6000 simulations to assess the combined impacts of climate variability and change using climate change projections available for the study area csiro bom 2015 our methodology allows for the first time the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the impacts of both climate variability and change on the temporal and spatial distribution of vegetation in dryland wetlands and the implications for habitat provision 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in the northern macquarie marshes which are found in north western new south wales fig 1 the macquarie marshes hereafter the marshes are a range of semi permanent to ephemeral wetlands and extensive floodplains near the outlet of the macquarie basin 75 000 km2 which is part of the murray darling basin inflows to the marshes are regulated by burrendong dam storage capacity of 1188 gl and an additional flood mitigation zone of 489 gl some areas of the marshes are ramsar listed wetlands and support a wide variety of flood dependent flora such as river red gum eucalyptus camaldulensis black box e largiflorens coolibah e coolabah water couch paspallum distichum common reed phragmites australis and mixed marsh eleocharis acuta typha sp juncus ingens roberts and marston 2011 the marshes provide habitats for a range of wildlife including waterbirds kingsford and auld 2005 kingsford and johnson 1998 fish rayner et al 2009 2015 and amphibians ocock et al 2014 the macquarie marshes are located in a semi arid region with mean annual rainfall of 443 mm 2010 which is greatly exceeded by evapotranspiration between 1500 and 2000 mm per year average daily temperatures range from 30 36 c in summer and 30 36 c in winter the topography of the domain is very mild with elevation ranging from 130 to 149 m a s l and an average slope less than 0 0005 m m 2 2 ecohydrologic emulator of the marshes vegetation water dynamics 2 2 1 quasi 2d hydrodynamic model of the marshes the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model developed by riccardi 2000 has been extensively used in wetland systems breda et al 2021 rodríguez et al 2017 sandi et al 2021 2019 the hydrodynamic model solves the shallow flow differential equations for mass and momentum conservation using a finite differences method applied to rectangular cells a full description of the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model and model performance for the marshes is presented by sandi et al 2019 sandi et al 2019 used a cell size resolution of 90 90 m 40 096 cells obtained by resampling a 1 m resolution lidar digital elevation model dem water level time series recorded at gauging stations pillicawarrina and miltara see fig 1c were used as upstream and downstream boundary conditions respectively and all other boundaries were set as no flow the hydrodynamic model was manually calibrated and tested by adjusting manning s roughness in all cells until good performance indicators were achieved sandi et al 2019 simulated and observed water levels at bora channel station were compared after each adjustment until achieving excellent performance 10 pbias 10 and nse 0 75 bora channel station is the only one available within the domain that could be used for the comparison of water levels see fig 1c after the model results were verified at bora channel station simulated inundation maps and observed inundation maps derived from landsat imagery thomas et al 2010 2011 were also tested showing a very good model performance with an overall accuracy oa of 0 80 when comparing the extent of inundation full details of the testing and calibration of the hydrodynamic model were presented by sandi et al 2019 results from the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model were available from 1991 to 2018 for each day the inundated area volume and water depth was extracted for each of the 40 096 cells this daily data is used to develop the hydrodynamic emulator 2 2 2 hydrodynamic emulator the emulator of daily hydrodynamics is based on approximating the network of channels and wetlands as a series of interconnected level pool reservoirs this is motivated by the observation that both channel and water surface slopes are hydraulically small two steps are involved in configuring the emulator the first involves subdividing the hydrodynamic model domain into patches whose number is much less than the number of hydrodynamic model cells for the marshes we subdivided the domain into 49 patches representing the dominant vegetation associations with each patch having a relatively homogenous vegetation fig 2 the patches were selected based on the observed inundation response and the criteria of sandi et al 2020b the size of the patches ranges from 26 to 900 hectares there are 20 non woody vegetation patches common reed water couch and mixed marsh and 29 woody vegetation patches river red gum sandi et al 2020b demonstrated that discretization into patches is the best way to describe vegetation dynamics because it indirectly incorporates local effects within the patch soil moisture redistribution seed availability etc each patch is represented by a level pool reservoir the second step uses the approach developed by borwell et al 2015 to set up a system of linear equations side constrains eq 1 to simulate the network of n interconnected level pool reservoirs or nodes j q i j k q k i δ v i n o d a l m a s s b a l a n c e q k i f k i v i o u t f l o w v o l u m e s i d e c o n s t r a i n s 1 i 1 2 n j 1 2 n k 1 2 n where q i j is the daily flow discharge from node j to node i δ v i is the change in the volume of reservoir i over a day and f k i is the fraction of the average volume in reservoir i released as outflow to node k the volume outflow relationship for each patch was obtained from the results of the hydrodynamic model that was run from 1989 to 2017 the hydrodynamic model provides daily water depths and flows on a mesh of 90 m x 90 m cells so construction of the volume outflow relationship for each patch required integration of depths in the cells within the patch and integration of flows across the boundary cells of the patch the outflows are separated depending on which neighbouring patches they discharge into for example fig 3 shows the volume outflow relationships for patch 7 which is connected to patch 9 and patch 10 as seen in fig 2b the number of wet cells in patch 7 and the depth of each cell are used to determine the patch volume v7 the flows from the boundary cells between patch 7 and patch 9 are integrated to get the outflow q9 7 whereas flows from the boundary cells between patch 7 and patch 10 are integrated to get q10 7 the volume outflow relationship may be nonlinear following borwell et al 2015 the linear equation system in eq 1 is solved multiple times with the outflow fraction f k i determined by the slope of the line between the origin and the outflow corresponding to the average volume at the previous iteration 2 2 3 representation of vegetation dynamics each wetland patch represented as reservoir in the emulator is associated with one of six vegetation states for woody vegetation river red gum rrg the condition can be good condition rrg 0 40 apparent mortality intermediate condition rrg 40 80 apparent mortality and poor condition rrg more than 80 of trees showing apparent mortality for non woody vegetation the vegetation type can be common reed water couch mixed marsh and terrestrial vegetation these vegetation species were selected as they are the dominant species covering about 99 of our study site and the selected vegetation states are compatible with vegetation surveys in the area bowen and simpson 2010 bowen et al 2017 wilson 1992 that were used for model testing establishment composition and change of these vegetation types can be described in terms of the water regime i e inundation timing frequency depth and duration roberts and marston 2011 webb et al 2012 timing was not included here because it is not critical for the species that occupy most of the northern macquarie marshes in our model a series of rules determine how the vegetation changes depending on whether water regime conditions are above or below a minimum inundation threshold see table 1 at each time step the water regime descriptors frequency and duration are determined for each patch and are then compared against the minimum inundation threshold associated with vegetation maintenance health these minimum inundation thresholds conditions are based on previous research roberts and marston 2011 sandi et al 2020b and follow a similar analysis reported in sandi et al 2019 because the hydrodynamic emulator only considers volumes and not water depths the latter are obtained from volume vi vs water depth h i relationships based on the detailed hydrodynamic model results inundated areas and storage volumes in the patch are determined aggregating the values of cells that fell inside each patch similar to the procedure used for the volume vs outflow relations daily water depths are obtained by dividing the volume by the inundated area estimated by identifying wet cells in the patch an example of the volume vs water depth relation for patch 7 obtained using this procedure is included in fig 3 the vi vs h i relationship for each patch is used to determine the water depth at each time step which is compared with the minimum inundation requirements table 1 for different vegetation species in the marshes for rrg we consider three vegetation conditions good intermediate or poor the three requirements of frequency duration and depth are used to categorize the rrg patch into one of three possible health conditions for the non woody vegetation we track the long term sustainability of wetland vegetation by considering transitions to terrestrial vegetation due to extended dry conditions when the water regime requirements for common reed or water couch mixed marsh are not satisfied transition to terrestrial vegetation occurs in the non woody patches when the water regime in patches of terrestrial vegetation satisfies the conditions for common reed or water couch mixed marsh then the patch will transition back to wetland vegetation 2 2 4 embedding the emulator in a wathnet5 model of the marshes a simulation model of the marshes was developed using wathnet5 kuczera et al 2009 the core of the simulation model is a network linear program with optional linear side constraints castro and nabona 1996 this linear program is solved for each day of the simulation to allocate water within the network according to user defined objectives and constraints user defined scripts define the runtime parameters of the linear program they allow for high level rules to control the parameterization of the linear program the linear equation system in eq 1 was embedded in the linear program model of the marshes wathnet5 this was accomplished by representing each patch in fig 2 as a storage reservoir and using arcs to connect the reservoir nodes linear side constraints were used to implement the outflow volume relationship and implemented in the arcs of the network scripts were used to implement the vegetation transition rules within the reservoirs patches of wathnet5 2 3 model testing to test the performance of the emulator to simulate the hydro vegetation dynamics in the marshes daily simulations were carried out using records from pillicawarrina gauge station from 1991 to 2020 flow and volume time series produced by the emulator on different vegetation patches were compared against the results of the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model to test the vegetation dynamics results three detailed vegetation maps based on observations were used a vegetation map and survey from 1991 wilson 1992 was used to define the initial condition of the vegetation patches after large inundations in 1989 and 1990 vegetation modelling results were then compared with vegetation maps and surveys carried out in 2008 during the millennium drought with a great percentage of the vegetation deteriorated and in 2013 after a series of record breaking rainfall events with considerable vegetation recovery bowen et al 2017 satellite products were also used to explore the changes in vegetation condition and transitions between wetland and terrestrial vegetation we used the seasonal fractional cover sfc product which represents the proportions of green non green and bare cover for summer spring winter and autumn derived from landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli images and available from auscover http www auscover org au the sfc product has been developed by the joint remote sensing research project jrsrp and has an overall root mean squared error rmse of 11 6 when compared to field data the 30 meter resolution values were averaged over each patch to obtain a mean sfc value per patch patches reported as good condition showed higher values of green sfc which would decrease when the water regime is not adequate to meet the requirements of the specific vegetation table 1 in the patch the use of this product allowed for identifying vegetation dynamics at shorter time scales than offered by the vegetation maps 2 4 climate variability and climate change we analyse the potential impacts of climatic variability by generating 1000 statistically representative streamflow time series based on 30 years of observation 1991 2020 at pillicawarrina gauging station we accomplish this using the multi site multi season multi state contemporaneous auto regressive mssscar model kiem et al 2021 kuczera 2020 a tool within the wathnet5 package mssscar uses transformations to remove skewness and temporal persistence in hydroclimate data so that the transformed data is consistent with a multivariate normal distribution skewness is removed using a box cox transformation eq 2 to get a random variable y that has zero skewness and approximates a normal distribution 2 y t q t λ 1 λ λ 0 log e q t λ 0 t 1 n where qt is the observed flow data for year t in our case from pillicawarrina station while λ is the box cox transformation parameter selected so that skewness of y is zero the variable y is then standardized eq 3 resulting in z being normally distributed with mean of zero and variance of 1 3 z t y t μ y σ y t 1 n where μ y and σ y are mean and standard deviation of y the temporal persistence is represented as an autoregressive structure eq 4 with p lags 4 z t k 1 p k z t k a t with k an autoregressive coefficient 1 ϕ k 1 and a t the disturbance or white noise distributed as an independently gaussian variable with mean zero and variance σ a 2 this model is calibrated against observed annual data to obtain values for λ μ y σ y σ a and k data generation involves the inverse transformation the disturbance a t is randomly sampled from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance σ a 2 to calculate z t eq 3 and then y t eq 2 finally the annual flow is obtained by the inverse box cox transformation eq 5 5 q t λ y t 1 1 λ y t 1 1 λ 0 exp y t λ 0 t 1 n the annual flow is then disaggregated into daily values using a nearest neighbour approach the synthetically generated time series account for natural climatic variability by preserving the autocorrelation structure of the observed data i e the extent to which a wet dry seasons or years are followed by further wet dry seasons or years we also analyse the effects of climate change by simulating streamflow scenarios that correspond to the representative concentration pathway 4 5 and 8 5 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 we use predictions for 2090 from an ensemble of climate models csiro bom 2015 for our area of interest which project changes in streamflow of 10 20 for the rcp4 5 and 20 40 for the rcp8 5 scenarios we adjusted the 1000 stochastically generated 30 year time series applying constant factors to the full time series of 0 9 1 1 and 0 7 for the rcp4 5 and 0 8 1 2 and 0 4 for the rcp8 5 scenario respectively these constant factors represent the median upper and lower limits of the projections of the two scenarios and are used to compare results of wetland condition under climate change 3 results 3 1 emulation of hydrodynamics the 49 patch model was implemented in wathnet5 to emulate the hydro and vegetation dynamics of the mashes the wathnet5 simulation is compared with the 28 year results of the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model fig 4 shows that the emulated flows and volumes from selected patches across the simulation domain show overall very good performance when compared to the hydrodynamic model with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values see supplementary material table s2 it can be seen that the nlp s emulator adequately simulates high flows floods in 1991 1999 2010 and 2016 and low flows millennium drought 2001 and 2009 furthermore the good match with volumes in the patches and flows between patches ensures that the nlp s emulator adequately represents the transit times and water routing though the system the nlp s emulator is extremely efficient in terms of cpu time when compared with the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model sandi et al 2019 conducted simulations for the marshes over a period of 28 years 1991 to 2018 each year of simulation took 12 to 18 h to run on a dell desktop computer intel core i7 3770 cpu 3 4 ghz ram 16 0 gb windows 7 operating system the nlp s emulator took about 1 min on a similar computer to simulate the entire 28 year period this makes the emulator 26 000 times faster than the hydrodynamic model which is an outstanding reduction in computation time that makes feasible for extensive scenario evaluation and decision support 3 2 emulation of vegetation dynamics we compared our vegetation dynamic model results with vegetation maps for the years 1991 2008 and 2013 bowen et al 2017 bowen and simpson 2010 wilson 1992 for the non woody vegetation types common reed and water couch mixed marsh the focus was on transitions from wetland to terrestrial vegetation during droughts while for woody vegetation river red gum degradation in vegetation condition was analysed fig 5 shows that the model successfully reproduces the spatial distribution of rrg and non woody vegetation when compared to observed values to assess the goodness of fit of our results against the observations the coehn s kappa ck and overall accuracy oa coefficients were calculated congalton and green 2019 the coefficients were computed by comparing observed and modelled data in a raster with 90 90 meter resolution we found ck between 0 72 and 0 83 and oa between 0 73 and 0 86 which are considered as high in comparison with values reported in the literature bhatnagar et al 2021 garcía arias et al 2013 snedden and steyer 2013 demonstrating a good fit of the modelled results it is important to consider that vegetation in 1991 and 2013 represents conditions after big flooding events while 2008 represents condition during the millennium drought in 2008 most of the rrg patches were in poor or intermediate condition and this is captured by the model in 2013 the model successfully captures the recovering of rrg showing the majority of the area with intermediate and good condition for the non woody vegetation encroachment of terrestrial vegetation in 2008 followed by a recovery of common reed and water couch mixed marsh in 2013 is successfully simulated by the emulator in addition the remote sensing data product green sfc was used to compare the emulator results of rrg vegetation dynamics rrg is an evergreen tree species which responds to drought by shedding its leaves to conserve water and energy resulting in smaller canopy and lower green fractional cover value these dynamics can be observed using satellite imagery in fig 6 it can be seen that the nlp s emulator orange lines can reproduce the dynamics of patches i e poor intermediate and good conditions that are unaffected by drought i e patch 7 and also of patches that deteriorate during drought and recover after floods i e patch 20 in unaffected patches the sfc remains mostly above 45 red dashed line its variation could represent changes in the understory noise in the data and or seasonality of tree vegetative cover when the modelled vegetation condition varies from good to intermediate or poor this change is associated with green sfc values below 45 as previously commented the simulation results of nlp s match the condition reported in the field surveys of 1991 2008 and 2013 blue dots the good agreement between simulated and satellite derived vegetation dynamics fig 6 provides additional confidence in the efficiency and performance of the emulator for non woody vegetation green sfc was used to determine possible transitions between wetland and terrestrial vegetation it is important to note that the emulator is not simulating the health condition of each non woody vegetation patch but its transition to and from terrestrial vegetation common reed and water couch mixed marsh can be encroached by terrestrial vegetation after long periods of drought and when substantial inundation occurs those terrestrial areas can recover and become common reed and water couch mixed marsh again hence we tracked the transitions that occurred during the millennium drought using green sfc fig 7 shows that for non transitional patches i e patch 5 green sfc is variable but never reaches values lower than 25 meanwhile for transitional patches i e patch 11 encroachment occurs when there are consecutive years of green sfc 25 aquatic vegetation has weak seasonality which results in less variation in green sfc whereas encroached terrestrial species are mostly annuals which have strong seasonality that results in greater variation in green sfc when the terrestrial vegetation colonizes an area an increase in green fractional cover occurs due to the bloom of the invasive species circle showing continuous increase in sfc during drought it can be seen that the emulator can represent the transition to terrestrial vegetation during the drought and the subsequent recovery after the flooding event of 2011 3 3 climate variability simulations once the capabilities of the ecohydrological emulator were tested the potential effect of climate variability was assessed by analysing wetland response for 1000 stochastically generated 30 year streamflow time series note that management decisions are embedded in the input flows because the streamflow is originated from regulated and unregulated sources so the different simulations are intended to represent natural and managed conditions to compare the stochastic simulations we adopted the following definition the marshes are in severe condition when more than 50 of the rrg is in poor intermediate condition and there is more than 30 of terrestrial encroachment on the non woody vegetation this threshold is somewhat arbitrary but it matches the observed general conditions during the millennium drought when some parts of marshes were still reasonably watered and other parts were much more affected for each simulation we calculated the percentage of time that this severe condition occurred during the 30 year period fig 8 shows the percentage of time the marshes experience severe conditions as a function of the input flow averaged over the 30 year period it can be seen that the percentage of time the marshes are in severe condition is negatively correlated with the annual average input flow and that the average time the marshes experience severe conditions is 43 18 std dev this considerable variation is due not only to differences in annual average input flow but also to differences in the distribution of the flows over time for example if we take as a point of reference the simulations for the 1991 2020 period in the observed record red point in fig 8a the marshes were in severe condition approximately 33 of the time essentially during the entire millennium drought for the same annual average input flow of 580 ml day different simulations resulted in severe condition percentages that varied widely such as simulation 772 with only 12 of the time in severe conditions and simulation 501 with 59 of the time in severe conditions this can be explained with the help of fig 8b which shows that more frequent intermediate flows simulation 772 generate a better condition in the marshes than less frequent large peak flows simulation 501 we can obtain information on the frequency of intermediate and large flows by calculating the percentage of time flows above a certain threshold occur in fig 8a we have included a colour scale from yellow to dark blue to represent the percentage of time of flows are above the 500 ml day threshold we chose 500 ml day because it is close to the mean annual discharge over all the simulations and provides good inundation conditions in the marshes fig 8a shows that the variability in the time that the marshes are in severe condition is also a function of the percentage of time of flows above 500 ml day for example if flows larger than 500 ml day occur 40 of the time the marshes only experience severe condition less than 20 of the time whereas if flows of more than 500 ml day are present less than 15 of the time the wetland stays in severe condition from 40 to 90 of the time 3 4 climate change simulations to analyse the impact of climate change we adjusted the previous 1000 stochastically generated flow inputs using proportionality factors of 30 and 10 and 10 to represent the expected change in streamflow under the rcp4 5 scenario and 60 20 and 20 for the rcp8 5 scenario csiro bom 2015 results in fig 9 show that wetland condition is highly affected by climate change induced declines in streamflow fig 9a and b show that on average 89 6 std dev 63 16 std dev 54 18 std dev and 46 17 of the time the marshes remain in severe condition when the projected decline of flow with respect to current conditions is 60 30 20 and 10 respectively in comparison the time in severe conditions under current conditions was 43 18 whereas a flow increase of 10 and 20 would result in severe conditions 40 17 and 37 17 of the time respectively fig 9b shows that the dispersion of the severe time percentage increases from the driest 60 to the wettest scenario 20 notice that on average the response of the wetland vegetation is more sensitive to reductions in flow than to flow increases which can be seen in the slope θ of the lines blued dashed lines connecting the median θ 2 θ 1 4 discussion our results show that the nlp s based emulator can successfully simulate the hydrodynamics and vegetation dynamics of dryland floodplain wetlands as shown by comparing the model against the hydrodynamic model vegetation surveys and remote sensing products figs 4 7 we found that the flows and volumes simulated by the emulator are compatible with the results from the hydrodynamic model fig 4 of major practical significance is the fact that the emulator requires 1 26 000 of the computational effort of the hydrodynamic model having a fast emulator enables running thousands of simulations to investigate the effects of climate variability and climate change on the vegetation condition including deterioration of woody vegetation and terrestrial encroachment in non woody vegetation hydrodynamic models have been implemented to study water movement and ecological indicators in regulated floodplains wen et al 2013 but our emulator is the first simulation tool enabling the analysis of the full uncertainty and sensitivity of vegetation conditions associated with climate variability and change with respect to the impact of climate variability our results show that condition in the marshes can vary widely as a result of the naturally high variability of the australian climate as expected lower average flows over the 30 year simulation period result in worse conditions for the marshes fig 8a this result is in agreement with bino et al 2015 who found that inundation probabilities are positively associated to vegetation state and negatively associated with transition towards terrestrial vegetation in the macquarie marshes moreover we identified that the variability in the marshes condition is also affected by the differences in the water regimes fig 8b not just the average flow more frequent medium flows result in better wetland conditions than infrequent large flows even if the average flows are similar the importance of the water regime for rrg condition in the macquarie marshes has been reported in previous studies catelotti et al 2015 saintilan et al 2021a sandi et al 2019 the insights from the climate variability scenario simulations show that variations in flow delivery can produce a wide range of wetland conditions with the same input volume these findings have important implications for environmental water applications which are used globally to maintain the ecological integrity of large floodplain wetland complex as an example for the three simulations illustrated in fig 8b with an annual average input flow of 580 ml day a simulation with 32 of the time with flows above 500 ml day 772 resulted in severe conditions in the wetland for 12 of the time a simulation with 27 of the time with flows over 500 ml day 1991 2020 period resulted in 33 of time in severe conditions and a simulation with flows over 500 ml day 501 for 23 of the time resulted in 59 of time in severe conditions a linear regression carried out over all the climate variability simulations indicates that the percentage of time of flows above 500 ml day can explain half of the variability of the portion of time the marshes are in severe conditions see eq s1 in supplementary material our results indicate that the percentage of time that the marshes stay in severe conditions will increase under most scenarios of climate change this result is in agreement with other studies where the vulnerability of the macquarie marshes under climate change has been highlighted sandi et al 2020a xi et al 2021 the increase in time under severe conditions will affect the capacity of the wetlands to provide ecosystem services with some potentially irreversible effects on some of the supported species although in our analysis we focus on the percentage of time the marshes stay in severe conditions irrespective of the sequence of dry years there is a strong correlation r2 0 9 between that percentage and the maximum consecutive time in severe conditions see fig s1 in supplementary material many fish birds and macroinvertebrate populations cannot be sustained if a succession of years of severe conditions produces loss and fragmentation of preferred habitats interfering with their regular breeding rogers et al 2010 for species with life spans less than the dry periods extended droughts will prevent their use of the marshes as preferred habitat permanently noting that severe conditions do not occur evenly over the entire marshes our model can be used to identify areas that are more critically affected in fig 9 we show that the time the marshes are in severe condition is on average of 89 for the drier scenario 60 reduction in flows and only 37 for the wetter scenario 20 increase in flows to illustrate how these conditions could be reflected temporally and spatially a comparison of the condition and vegetation types from two simulations over all patches is presented in fig 10 the two simulations had identical initial conditions but one corresponded to the drier scenario and the other corresponded to the wetter scenario for the drier scenario there are more patches of rrg in poor and intermediate condition red and light yellow for longer periods and greater encroachment of terrestrial vegetation dark blue than in the wetter scenario moreover the total area of the wetland that is in poor intermediate condition varies over time from 9 to 80 for the drier scenario and from 9 to 65 for the wetter scenario for example by year 6 62 of the area is in adverse condition 49 of rgg in poor and intermediate condition and 13 of terrestrial vegetation encroachment for the drier scenario while only 9 is in adverse condition for the wetter scenario those adverse conditions affect specific areas of the wetlands differently with patches in the middle and northern parts of the wetland being particularly affected overall our results suggest that under climate change scenarios vegetation is expected to stay in severe condition for longer periods and over larger areas for the drier scenarios analogous to what is happening in simulation 501 in fig 8b under climate change projections longer drought periods and more extreme events are anticipated gu et al 2020 tabari 2020 whetton et al 1993 and as a result the marshes are expected to remain in severe condition for a longer time even though predictions of future distribution of droughts and floods are not currently available our results combining climate change and variability encompass a wide range of possible distributions that include those situations the macquarie marshes are already under pressure due to land reclamation for food production flow regulation cattle grazing invasion of exotic weeds and droughts whalley et al 2011 yu et al 2015 this pressure is reflected in the results for the period 1991 2020 fig 8a red point which shows that the system was in severe condition 33 of the time the current situation can be exacerbated by climate change with the drier scenario projecting an increase in the duration of severe conditions to 89 of the time higher frequency of severe conditions in the macquarie marshes is expected to reduce its function of providing habitat for a range of aquatic and terrestrial animals including the endangered australasian bittern botaurus poiciloptilus and the vulnerable murray cod maccullochella peeli kingsford and johnson 1998 oeh 2012 rayner et al 2015 climate change could also impact the benefits derived from the marshes such as food production living space and recreation organic carbon storage ground water table recharge and water purification junk et al 2013 whitaker et al 2015 we used an nlp s ecohydrologic emulator in the macquarie marshes to analyse the effects of climate variability and climate change on vegetation condition we acknowledge that our approach has some limitations and further research is necessary first our approach is based in volume outflow and volume water depth relationships that were extracted from a previously available quasi 2d hydrodynamic model for other applications these relations need to be extracted from a hydrodynamic model specifically setup for this objective or from measurements and synthetically obtained relations i e using fine resolution elevation maps as in hayashi and van der kamp 2000 both approaches requiring considerable resources including time investment second we used a simplified representation of vegetation dynamics which respond to changes of flood frequency duration and depth we acknowledge that the importance of other factors associated with future climate change such as flood timing increase in air temperature rise in evapotranspiration change in rainfall and rise in atmospheric co2 concentration need to be considered in future work third we assessed the ecological resilience capacity to recover of the vegetation based on information collected over 30 years of analysis which include about 10 years of continuous stressful conditions millennium drought however longer term effects may diminish the resilience particularly of woody vegetation for example catelotti et al 2015 found rrg dieback in areas of the macquarie marshes between 1993 and 2011 but as noted by saintilan et al 2021a those areas had been already identified as stressed in 1993 considering that the die out of long live trees under extended dry periods might be impossible to recover more severe conditions in the marshes than the ones presented in this study could occur fourth due to the characteristics of the catchment and the availability of gauged records we used input flows that are regulated and do not represent natural conditions this implies that management decisions are embedded in the input flows and different scenarios could arise from those decisions so our simulations of 7000 different scenarios also include uncertainties in the decision making however the regulation capacity of the system is limited as during heavy rain periods dam spills and unregulated tributaries flows result in extensive flooding while during extended droughts the environmental flow reserves cannot guarantee minimum inundation conditions because of that limited capacity we expect uncertainties in management to be less important than those due to climate conditions but further research should be done in order to assess the effects of management decisions in the catchment the results presented in this study show vegetation condition and uncertainties under climate change scenarios in a ramsar wetland in the semiarid region of south east australia here we highlight the importance of using a computationally efficient modelling approach that can be used to fully assess the impacts of future scenarios including their uncertainties due to climatic variability this approach can be extended to enable adaptive ecosystem management under the uncertainty of extreme events climate change and social economic development it can also be incorporated into multi objective optimization frameworks to optimize management of environmental flows gilmore et al 2009 yang 2011 5 conclusions and future work climate change is expected to put more pressure on large dryland floodplain wetlands in australia and elsewhere so it is important to quantify the extent of the degradation and its uncertainty for adaptive management of these valuable ecosystems our fast emulator allowed us to analyse the combined effects of climate variability and climate change on wetland evolution using results from 7000 30 year simulations that ran 26 000 times faster than a hydrodynamic model we found that the annual average flow and the percentage of time the flow is above a threshold of 500 ml day can be used to describe the effects of flow magnitude and distribution on wetland response low values of these two indicators result in an increase in severe conditions in the wetlands overall climate change scenarios with reduced flow showed longer times and larger areas of the wetland in severe condition and fewer episodes of vegetation recovery in contrast scenarios with flow increases did not show substantial improvement in wetland conditions decision support for wetland ecosystems that consider climate change may benefit from this methodology because the capability of carrying out multiple simulations in computationally practicable time opens up the possibility to comprehensively study management options including optimisation and trade off analysis of alternatives even though the condition of these dryland wetlands is heavily controlled by climate wetland condition is also affected by management decisions that control water allocations from upstream dam the fast emulator provides the opportunity to more thoroughly explore management options to help achieve more resilience to climate variability and change impacts

15992,during the millennium drought in southeast australia 2001 2009 dryland wetlands experienced widespread ecological deterioration which highlighted their vulnerability to natural climate variability and the potential effects of drying climate change here we use 30 year observed streamflow data 1991 2020 and numerical models to assess the impacts of climate variability and climate change on the macquarie marshes the marshes a large floodplain wetland complex in the semi arid region of new south wales australia a fast ecohydrologic emulator based on network linear programming with side constraints was developed to simulate the spatial and temporal responses of different wetland vegetation types to water regime the emulator represents the wetland by a series of inter connected level pool reservoirs with the volume discharge relationship obtained from a calibrated quasi 2d hydrodynamic model the emulator reproduces daily flows and volume with good accuracy nash sutcliffe statistic ranging from 0 61 to 0 96 with 1 26 000 of the computational effort we use the emulator to simulate the potential effects of climatic variability on vegetation by running the model over 30 years of observed data and 1000 statistically representative 30 year streamflow time series which were generated using a stochastic model calibrated to the gauged flows the collection of results for all 1000 contemporary simulations indicates the marshes experience severe conditions 43 18 of the time in a 30 year period we then ran an additional 6000 simulations to assess the combined impacts of climate variability and future climate change at the end of the century for the driest future climates 60 and 30 reduction in runoff the marshes remain in severe condition 89 6 and 63 16 of the time respectively while no major differences with respect to the contemporary conditions were found for the wetter future our results highlight the importance of quantifying the extent and uncertainty in the degradation of these ecosystems due to climate variability and change for informing management decisions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wetlands climate change emulator network linear programming 1 introduction large floodplain wetlands in arid and semiarid regions are an essential environmental asset for sustaining regional biodiversity they support a wide range of biota such as flood dependant vegetation roberts and marston 2011 waterbirds kingsford and auld 2005 fish rayner et al 2015 and amphibians ocock et al 2014 because they rely on episodic inundation from upstream catchments these wetlands are often under stress due to competition with other water uses such as agriculture human and livestock consumption and industrial use during the millennium drought in southeast australia 2001 2009 dryland wetlands had to endure some of the most severe conditions in terms of water scarcity in over a hundred years resulting in widespread ecological deterioration van dijk et al 2013 most of the wetlands recovered in subsequent wet years but the drought highlighted the vulnerability of these ecosystems to natural climate variability and also to the potential effects of climate change climate change may worsen the stress on wetlands due an increase in evaporation and anthropogenic water demands higher evaporation and lower inflows to floodplain wetlands are expected to reduce flooding frequency and increase the severity of droughts that will affect plant species distribution community structure and hydro morphological dynamics junk et al 2013 saintilan et al 2021a 2021b in southern australia a decrease in the magnitude frequency and duration of floods has been observed for the period 1975 2012 gu et al 2020 which may have been exacerbated by climate change severe droughts are likely to damage wetland s ecosystem functions and services such as water supply improvement of water quality and maintenance of biodiversity by 2100 at least 6000 km2 of inland wetlands around the world are expected to be lost due climate change xi et al 2021 assessment of the impacts of climate change on dryland wetlands requires in depth understanding of the response of different vegetation types with different water requirements to varying flow conditions hydrodynamic models are commonly used to study wetland water dynamics garcia et al 2015 marsooli et al 2016 popescu et al 2015 wester et al 2018 and its links to vegetation hydrological preferences models have been implemented to improve estimation of hydrological fluxes analyse wetland connectivity support decision making and predict impacts of anthropogenic activity e g water extraction pollution land use or climate change karim et al 2012 morrissey et al 2021 saco et al 2018 2020 wester et al 2018 in addition studies have used models to analyse the effect of climate change on wetlands by considering scenarios of wetter and drier future predicted climates fu et al 2015 johnson et al 2005 sandi et al 2020a however due to their complexity and computational demands numerical models have been limited in their capacity to incorporate natural climate variability including stochastic extreme events such as drought and flood or climate change because of the requirements for assessing a large number of scenarios simulations as ecosystems in arid and semiarid areas are particularly sensitive and vulnerable to climate variability cleverly et al 2019 huang et al 2017 wen and saintilan 2015 this last point has been a strong limitation for predictions of wetland response to future climate even though the algorithms in hydrodynamic models have improved and computer processors have rapidly evolved the computational cost to run such models remains a substantial constraint limiting the number and scope of scenarios that can be simulated simulation times can be in the range of hours to days neal et al 2018 nguyen et al 2021 wilson et al 2007 yang et al 2012 depending on the spatial and temporal resolutions size of the simulation domain simulation length and computer characteristics additionally hydrodynamic models require a considerable amount of information bathymetry digital elevation models land use maps for roughness coefficients upstream and downstream hydrological information and generate huge volumes of results furthermore when hydrodynamic models include vegetation dynamics best et al 2018 sandi et al 2020a the number of input and output files and the complexity of the model increase given these time constraints conventional ecohydrological models are unable to evaluate in a meaningful way the inherent uncertainty in the predictions of the vulnerability of wetlands to future climate change practical analysis of the impacts of climate change and climate variability through scenario comparison requires a fast model that can emulate vegetation water dynamics of dryland wetlands emulators use algebraic functions of the variables of interest to represent physical phenomena instead of complex physically based equations giselle fernández godino et al 2019 emulators have been implemented to reduce runtimes in computationally expensive models peherstorfer et al 2018 and have been applied in hydrology hall et al 2011 zhou et al 2021 aerospace engineering brevault et al 2020 and other areas emulators have also been used as part of water resources optimisation frameworks in which many scenarios tens of thousands must be run in order to explore all possible solutions for example cui et al 2014 used network linear programming to emulate the complex gnangara groundwater system that is part of perth s water supply a 40 cpu h modflow simulation was reduced to a 1 cpu s emulated simulation with monthly flux standard errors of 10 to 15 here we use a network linear program with side constraints nlp s ecohydrologic emulator for a large dryland floodplain wetland the macquarie marshes a ramsar wetland of international significance in semi arid new south wales australia we use our emulator to investigate the effects of climate variability and change on vegetation condition and in particular to address the question how does the uncertainty in the natural variability and the projected climate change scenarios affects the predictions of wetland ecohydrological response the emulator is built within wathnet5 kuczera et al 2009 a tool that has been widely used to manage water supply networks kibria and maheswaran 2012 kuczera 1992 singh and ibbitt 2018 wathnet5 has the advantage that it can incorporate side constraints which are used to describe the complex dynamics of the system it also allows for the incorporation of user defined algorithms to analyse other water dependent ecohydrologic variables like the response of wetland vegetation to frequency duration and depth of inundation roberts and marston 2011 sandi et al 2019 the emulator is developed using vegetation observations bowen et al 2017 wilson 1992 and numerical simulations of flow and vegetation response sandi et al 2020b in the macquarie marshes during a 30 year period 1991 2020 that included the millennium drought we use the emulator to simulate the expected effects of climate variability by running 1000 statistically representative streamflow time series with different flow frequencies and magnitude generated using an autoregressive model based on the 30 years of river flow records we then run an additional 6000 simulations to assess the combined impacts of climate variability and change using climate change projections available for the study area csiro bom 2015 our methodology allows for the first time the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the impacts of both climate variability and change on the temporal and spatial distribution of vegetation in dryland wetlands and the implications for habitat provision 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located in the northern macquarie marshes which are found in north western new south wales fig 1 the macquarie marshes hereafter the marshes are a range of semi permanent to ephemeral wetlands and extensive floodplains near the outlet of the macquarie basin 75 000 km2 which is part of the murray darling basin inflows to the marshes are regulated by burrendong dam storage capacity of 1188 gl and an additional flood mitigation zone of 489 gl some areas of the marshes are ramsar listed wetlands and support a wide variety of flood dependent flora such as river red gum eucalyptus camaldulensis black box e largiflorens coolibah e coolabah water couch paspallum distichum common reed phragmites australis and mixed marsh eleocharis acuta typha sp juncus ingens roberts and marston 2011 the marshes provide habitats for a range of wildlife including waterbirds kingsford and auld 2005 kingsford and johnson 1998 fish rayner et al 2009 2015 and amphibians ocock et al 2014 the macquarie marshes are located in a semi arid region with mean annual rainfall of 443 mm 2010 which is greatly exceeded by evapotranspiration between 1500 and 2000 mm per year average daily temperatures range from 30 36 c in summer and 30 36 c in winter the topography of the domain is very mild with elevation ranging from 130 to 149 m a s l and an average slope less than 0 0005 m m 2 2 ecohydrologic emulator of the marshes vegetation water dynamics 2 2 1 quasi 2d hydrodynamic model of the marshes the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model developed by riccardi 2000 has been extensively used in wetland systems breda et al 2021 rodríguez et al 2017 sandi et al 2021 2019 the hydrodynamic model solves the shallow flow differential equations for mass and momentum conservation using a finite differences method applied to rectangular cells a full description of the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model and model performance for the marshes is presented by sandi et al 2019 sandi et al 2019 used a cell size resolution of 90 90 m 40 096 cells obtained by resampling a 1 m resolution lidar digital elevation model dem water level time series recorded at gauging stations pillicawarrina and miltara see fig 1c were used as upstream and downstream boundary conditions respectively and all other boundaries were set as no flow the hydrodynamic model was manually calibrated and tested by adjusting manning s roughness in all cells until good performance indicators were achieved sandi et al 2019 simulated and observed water levels at bora channel station were compared after each adjustment until achieving excellent performance 10 pbias 10 and nse 0 75 bora channel station is the only one available within the domain that could be used for the comparison of water levels see fig 1c after the model results were verified at bora channel station simulated inundation maps and observed inundation maps derived from landsat imagery thomas et al 2010 2011 were also tested showing a very good model performance with an overall accuracy oa of 0 80 when comparing the extent of inundation full details of the testing and calibration of the hydrodynamic model were presented by sandi et al 2019 results from the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model were available from 1991 to 2018 for each day the inundated area volume and water depth was extracted for each of the 40 096 cells this daily data is used to develop the hydrodynamic emulator 2 2 2 hydrodynamic emulator the emulator of daily hydrodynamics is based on approximating the network of channels and wetlands as a series of interconnected level pool reservoirs this is motivated by the observation that both channel and water surface slopes are hydraulically small two steps are involved in configuring the emulator the first involves subdividing the hydrodynamic model domain into patches whose number is much less than the number of hydrodynamic model cells for the marshes we subdivided the domain into 49 patches representing the dominant vegetation associations with each patch having a relatively homogenous vegetation fig 2 the patches were selected based on the observed inundation response and the criteria of sandi et al 2020b the size of the patches ranges from 26 to 900 hectares there are 20 non woody vegetation patches common reed water couch and mixed marsh and 29 woody vegetation patches river red gum sandi et al 2020b demonstrated that discretization into patches is the best way to describe vegetation dynamics because it indirectly incorporates local effects within the patch soil moisture redistribution seed availability etc each patch is represented by a level pool reservoir the second step uses the approach developed by borwell et al 2015 to set up a system of linear equations side constrains eq 1 to simulate the network of n interconnected level pool reservoirs or nodes j q i j k q k i δ v i n o d a l m a s s b a l a n c e q k i f k i v i o u t f l o w v o l u m e s i d e c o n s t r a i n s 1 i 1 2 n j 1 2 n k 1 2 n where q i j is the daily flow discharge from node j to node i δ v i is the change in the volume of reservoir i over a day and f k i is the fraction of the average volume in reservoir i released as outflow to node k the volume outflow relationship for each patch was obtained from the results of the hydrodynamic model that was run from 1989 to 2017 the hydrodynamic model provides daily water depths and flows on a mesh of 90 m x 90 m cells so construction of the volume outflow relationship for each patch required integration of depths in the cells within the patch and integration of flows across the boundary cells of the patch the outflows are separated depending on which neighbouring patches they discharge into for example fig 3 shows the volume outflow relationships for patch 7 which is connected to patch 9 and patch 10 as seen in fig 2b the number of wet cells in patch 7 and the depth of each cell are used to determine the patch volume v7 the flows from the boundary cells between patch 7 and patch 9 are integrated to get the outflow q9 7 whereas flows from the boundary cells between patch 7 and patch 10 are integrated to get q10 7 the volume outflow relationship may be nonlinear following borwell et al 2015 the linear equation system in eq 1 is solved multiple times with the outflow fraction f k i determined by the slope of the line between the origin and the outflow corresponding to the average volume at the previous iteration 2 2 3 representation of vegetation dynamics each wetland patch represented as reservoir in the emulator is associated with one of six vegetation states for woody vegetation river red gum rrg the condition can be good condition rrg 0 40 apparent mortality intermediate condition rrg 40 80 apparent mortality and poor condition rrg more than 80 of trees showing apparent mortality for non woody vegetation the vegetation type can be common reed water couch mixed marsh and terrestrial vegetation these vegetation species were selected as they are the dominant species covering about 99 of our study site and the selected vegetation states are compatible with vegetation surveys in the area bowen and simpson 2010 bowen et al 2017 wilson 1992 that were used for model testing establishment composition and change of these vegetation types can be described in terms of the water regime i e inundation timing frequency depth and duration roberts and marston 2011 webb et al 2012 timing was not included here because it is not critical for the species that occupy most of the northern macquarie marshes in our model a series of rules determine how the vegetation changes depending on whether water regime conditions are above or below a minimum inundation threshold see table 1 at each time step the water regime descriptors frequency and duration are determined for each patch and are then compared against the minimum inundation threshold associated with vegetation maintenance health these minimum inundation thresholds conditions are based on previous research roberts and marston 2011 sandi et al 2020b and follow a similar analysis reported in sandi et al 2019 because the hydrodynamic emulator only considers volumes and not water depths the latter are obtained from volume vi vs water depth h i relationships based on the detailed hydrodynamic model results inundated areas and storage volumes in the patch are determined aggregating the values of cells that fell inside each patch similar to the procedure used for the volume vs outflow relations daily water depths are obtained by dividing the volume by the inundated area estimated by identifying wet cells in the patch an example of the volume vs water depth relation for patch 7 obtained using this procedure is included in fig 3 the vi vs h i relationship for each patch is used to determine the water depth at each time step which is compared with the minimum inundation requirements table 1 for different vegetation species in the marshes for rrg we consider three vegetation conditions good intermediate or poor the three requirements of frequency duration and depth are used to categorize the rrg patch into one of three possible health conditions for the non woody vegetation we track the long term sustainability of wetland vegetation by considering transitions to terrestrial vegetation due to extended dry conditions when the water regime requirements for common reed or water couch mixed marsh are not satisfied transition to terrestrial vegetation occurs in the non woody patches when the water regime in patches of terrestrial vegetation satisfies the conditions for common reed or water couch mixed marsh then the patch will transition back to wetland vegetation 2 2 4 embedding the emulator in a wathnet5 model of the marshes a simulation model of the marshes was developed using wathnet5 kuczera et al 2009 the core of the simulation model is a network linear program with optional linear side constraints castro and nabona 1996 this linear program is solved for each day of the simulation to allocate water within the network according to user defined objectives and constraints user defined scripts define the runtime parameters of the linear program they allow for high level rules to control the parameterization of the linear program the linear equation system in eq 1 was embedded in the linear program model of the marshes wathnet5 this was accomplished by representing each patch in fig 2 as a storage reservoir and using arcs to connect the reservoir nodes linear side constraints were used to implement the outflow volume relationship and implemented in the arcs of the network scripts were used to implement the vegetation transition rules within the reservoirs patches of wathnet5 2 3 model testing to test the performance of the emulator to simulate the hydro vegetation dynamics in the marshes daily simulations were carried out using records from pillicawarrina gauge station from 1991 to 2020 flow and volume time series produced by the emulator on different vegetation patches were compared against the results of the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model to test the vegetation dynamics results three detailed vegetation maps based on observations were used a vegetation map and survey from 1991 wilson 1992 was used to define the initial condition of the vegetation patches after large inundations in 1989 and 1990 vegetation modelling results were then compared with vegetation maps and surveys carried out in 2008 during the millennium drought with a great percentage of the vegetation deteriorated and in 2013 after a series of record breaking rainfall events with considerable vegetation recovery bowen et al 2017 satellite products were also used to explore the changes in vegetation condition and transitions between wetland and terrestrial vegetation we used the seasonal fractional cover sfc product which represents the proportions of green non green and bare cover for summer spring winter and autumn derived from landsat 5 tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli images and available from auscover http www auscover org au the sfc product has been developed by the joint remote sensing research project jrsrp and has an overall root mean squared error rmse of 11 6 when compared to field data the 30 meter resolution values were averaged over each patch to obtain a mean sfc value per patch patches reported as good condition showed higher values of green sfc which would decrease when the water regime is not adequate to meet the requirements of the specific vegetation table 1 in the patch the use of this product allowed for identifying vegetation dynamics at shorter time scales than offered by the vegetation maps 2 4 climate variability and climate change we analyse the potential impacts of climatic variability by generating 1000 statistically representative streamflow time series based on 30 years of observation 1991 2020 at pillicawarrina gauging station we accomplish this using the multi site multi season multi state contemporaneous auto regressive mssscar model kiem et al 2021 kuczera 2020 a tool within the wathnet5 package mssscar uses transformations to remove skewness and temporal persistence in hydroclimate data so that the transformed data is consistent with a multivariate normal distribution skewness is removed using a box cox transformation eq 2 to get a random variable y that has zero skewness and approximates a normal distribution 2 y t q t λ 1 λ λ 0 log e q t λ 0 t 1 n where qt is the observed flow data for year t in our case from pillicawarrina station while λ is the box cox transformation parameter selected so that skewness of y is zero the variable y is then standardized eq 3 resulting in z being normally distributed with mean of zero and variance of 1 3 z t y t μ y σ y t 1 n where μ y and σ y are mean and standard deviation of y the temporal persistence is represented as an autoregressive structure eq 4 with p lags 4 z t k 1 p k z t k a t with k an autoregressive coefficient 1 ϕ k 1 and a t the disturbance or white noise distributed as an independently gaussian variable with mean zero and variance σ a 2 this model is calibrated against observed annual data to obtain values for λ μ y σ y σ a and k data generation involves the inverse transformation the disturbance a t is randomly sampled from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance σ a 2 to calculate z t eq 3 and then y t eq 2 finally the annual flow is obtained by the inverse box cox transformation eq 5 5 q t λ y t 1 1 λ y t 1 1 λ 0 exp y t λ 0 t 1 n the annual flow is then disaggregated into daily values using a nearest neighbour approach the synthetically generated time series account for natural climatic variability by preserving the autocorrelation structure of the observed data i e the extent to which a wet dry seasons or years are followed by further wet dry seasons or years we also analyse the effects of climate change by simulating streamflow scenarios that correspond to the representative concentration pathway 4 5 and 8 5 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 we use predictions for 2090 from an ensemble of climate models csiro bom 2015 for our area of interest which project changes in streamflow of 10 20 for the rcp4 5 and 20 40 for the rcp8 5 scenarios we adjusted the 1000 stochastically generated 30 year time series applying constant factors to the full time series of 0 9 1 1 and 0 7 for the rcp4 5 and 0 8 1 2 and 0 4 for the rcp8 5 scenario respectively these constant factors represent the median upper and lower limits of the projections of the two scenarios and are used to compare results of wetland condition under climate change 3 results 3 1 emulation of hydrodynamics the 49 patch model was implemented in wathnet5 to emulate the hydro and vegetation dynamics of the mashes the wathnet5 simulation is compared with the 28 year results of the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model fig 4 shows that the emulated flows and volumes from selected patches across the simulation domain show overall very good performance when compared to the hydrodynamic model with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values see supplementary material table s2 it can be seen that the nlp s emulator adequately simulates high flows floods in 1991 1999 2010 and 2016 and low flows millennium drought 2001 and 2009 furthermore the good match with volumes in the patches and flows between patches ensures that the nlp s emulator adequately represents the transit times and water routing though the system the nlp s emulator is extremely efficient in terms of cpu time when compared with the quasi 2d hydrodynamic model sandi et al 2019 conducted simulations for the marshes over a period of 28 years 1991 to 2018 each year of simulation took 12 to 18 h to run on a dell desktop computer intel core i7 3770 cpu 3 4 ghz ram 16 0 gb windows 7 operating system the nlp s emulator took about 1 min on a similar computer to simulate the entire 28 year period this makes the emulator 26 000 times faster than the hydrodynamic model which is an outstanding reduction in computation time that makes feasible for extensive scenario evaluation and decision support 3 2 emulation of vegetation dynamics we compared our vegetation dynamic model results with vegetation maps for the years 1991 2008 and 2013 bowen et al 2017 bowen and simpson 2010 wilson 1992 for the non woody vegetation types common reed and water couch mixed marsh the focus was on transitions from wetland to terrestrial vegetation during droughts while for woody vegetation river red gum degradation in vegetation condition was analysed fig 5 shows that the model successfully reproduces the spatial distribution of rrg and non woody vegetation when compared to observed values to assess the goodness of fit of our results against the observations the coehn s kappa ck and overall accuracy oa coefficients were calculated congalton and green 2019 the coefficients were computed by comparing observed and modelled data in a raster with 90 90 meter resolution we found ck between 0 72 and 0 83 and oa between 0 73 and 0 86 which are considered as high in comparison with values reported in the literature bhatnagar et al 2021 garcía arias et al 2013 snedden and steyer 2013 demonstrating a good fit of the modelled results it is important to consider that vegetation in 1991 and 2013 represents conditions after big flooding events while 2008 represents condition during the millennium drought in 2008 most of the rrg patches were in poor or intermediate condition and this is captured by the model in 2013 the model successfully captures the recovering of rrg showing the majority of the area with intermediate and good condition for the non woody vegetation encroachment of terrestrial vegetation in 2008 followed by a recovery of common reed and water couch mixed marsh in 2013 is successfully simulated by the emulator in addition the remote sensing data product green sfc was used to compare the emulator results of rrg vegetation dynamics rrg is an evergreen tree species which responds to drought by shedding its leaves to conserve water and energy resulting in smaller canopy and lower green fractional cover value these dynamics can be observed using satellite imagery in fig 6 it can be seen that the nlp s emulator orange lines can reproduce the dynamics of patches i e poor intermediate and good conditions that are unaffected by drought i e patch 7 and also of patches that deteriorate during drought and recover after floods i e patch 20 in unaffected patches the sfc remains mostly above 45 red dashed line its variation could represent changes in the understory noise in the data and or seasonality of tree vegetative cover when the modelled vegetation condition varies from good to intermediate or poor this change is associated with green sfc values below 45 as previously commented the simulation results of nlp s match the condition reported in the field surveys of 1991 2008 and 2013 blue dots the good agreement between simulated and satellite derived vegetation dynamics fig 6 provides additional confidence in the efficiency and performance of the emulator for non woody vegetation green sfc was used to determine possible transitions between wetland and terrestrial vegetation it is important to note that the emulator is not simulating the health condition of each non woody vegetation patch but its transition to and from terrestrial vegetation common reed and water couch mixed marsh can be encroached by terrestrial vegetation after long periods of drought and when substantial inundation occurs those terrestrial areas can recover and become common reed and water couch mixed marsh again hence we tracked the transitions that occurred during the millennium drought using green sfc fig 7 shows that for non transitional patches i e patch 5 green sfc is variable but never reaches values lower than 25 meanwhile for transitional patches i e patch 11 encroachment occurs when there are consecutive years of green sfc 25 aquatic vegetation has weak seasonality which results in less variation in green sfc whereas encroached terrestrial species are mostly annuals which have strong seasonality that results in greater variation in green sfc when the terrestrial vegetation colonizes an area an increase in green fractional cover occurs due to the bloom of the invasive species circle showing continuous increase in sfc during drought it can be seen that the emulator can represent the transition to terrestrial vegetation during the drought and the subsequent recovery after the flooding event of 2011 3 3 climate variability simulations once the capabilities of the ecohydrological emulator were tested the potential effect of climate variability was assessed by analysing wetland response for 1000 stochastically generated 30 year streamflow time series note that management decisions are embedded in the input flows because the streamflow is originated from regulated and unregulated sources so the different simulations are intended to represent natural and managed conditions to compare the stochastic simulations we adopted the following definition the marshes are in severe condition when more than 50 of the rrg is in poor intermediate condition and there is more than 30 of terrestrial encroachment on the non woody vegetation this threshold is somewhat arbitrary but it matches the observed general conditions during the millennium drought when some parts of marshes were still reasonably watered and other parts were much more affected for each simulation we calculated the percentage of time that this severe condition occurred during the 30 year period fig 8 shows the percentage of time the marshes experience severe conditions as a function of the input flow averaged over the 30 year period it can be seen that the percentage of time the marshes are in severe condition is negatively correlated with the annual average input flow and that the average time the marshes experience severe conditions is 43 18 std dev this considerable variation is due not only to differences in annual average input flow but also to differences in the distribution of the flows over time for example if we take as a point of reference the simulations for the 1991 2020 period in the observed record red point in fig 8a the marshes were in severe condition approximately 33 of the time essentially during the entire millennium drought for the same annual average input flow of 580 ml day different simulations resulted in severe condition percentages that varied widely such as simulation 772 with only 12 of the time in severe conditions and simulation 501 with 59 of the time in severe conditions this can be explained with the help of fig 8b which shows that more frequent intermediate flows simulation 772 generate a better condition in the marshes than less frequent large peak flows simulation 501 we can obtain information on the frequency of intermediate and large flows by calculating the percentage of time flows above a certain threshold occur in fig 8a we have included a colour scale from yellow to dark blue to represent the percentage of time of flows are above the 500 ml day threshold we chose 500 ml day because it is close to the mean annual discharge over all the simulations and provides good inundation conditions in the marshes fig 8a shows that the variability in the time that the marshes are in severe condition is also a function of the percentage of time of flows above 500 ml day for example if flows larger than 500 ml day occur 40 of the time the marshes only experience severe condition less than 20 of the time whereas if flows of more than 500 ml day are present less than 15 of the time the wetland stays in severe condition from 40 to 90 of the time 3 4 climate change simulations to analyse the impact of climate change we adjusted the previous 1000 stochastically generated flow inputs using proportionality factors of 30 and 10 and 10 to represent the expected change in streamflow under the rcp4 5 scenario and 60 20 and 20 for the rcp8 5 scenario csiro bom 2015 results in fig 9 show that wetland condition is highly affected by climate change induced declines in streamflow fig 9a and b show that on average 89 6 std dev 63 16 std dev 54 18 std dev and 46 17 of the time the marshes remain in severe condition when the projected decline of flow with respect to current conditions is 60 30 20 and 10 respectively in comparison the time in severe conditions under current conditions was 43 18 whereas a flow increase of 10 and 20 would result in severe conditions 40 17 and 37 17 of the time respectively fig 9b shows that the dispersion of the severe time percentage increases from the driest 60 to the wettest scenario 20 notice that on average the response of the wetland vegetation is more sensitive to reductions in flow than to flow increases which can be seen in the slope θ of the lines blued dashed lines connecting the median θ 2 θ 1 4 discussion our results show that the nlp s based emulator can successfully simulate the hydrodynamics and vegetation dynamics of dryland floodplain wetlands as shown by comparing the model against the hydrodynamic model vegetation surveys and remote sensing products figs 4 7 we found that the flows and volumes simulated by the emulator are compatible with the results from the hydrodynamic model fig 4 of major practical significance is the fact that the emulator requires 1 26 000 of the computational effort of the hydrodynamic model having a fast emulator enables running thousands of simulations to investigate the effects of climate variability and climate change on the vegetation condition including deterioration of woody vegetation and terrestrial encroachment in non woody vegetation hydrodynamic models have been implemented to study water movement and ecological indicators in regulated floodplains wen et al 2013 but our emulator is the first simulation tool enabling the analysis of the full uncertainty and sensitivity of vegetation conditions associated with climate variability and change with respect to the impact of climate variability our results show that condition in the marshes can vary widely as a result of the naturally high variability of the australian climate as expected lower average flows over the 30 year simulation period result in worse conditions for the marshes fig 8a this result is in agreement with bino et al 2015 who found that inundation probabilities are positively associated to vegetation state and negatively associated with transition towards terrestrial vegetation in the macquarie marshes moreover we identified that the variability in the marshes condition is also affected by the differences in the water regimes fig 8b not just the average flow more frequent medium flows result in better wetland conditions than infrequent large flows even if the average flows are similar the importance of the water regime for rrg condition in the macquarie marshes has been reported in previous studies catelotti et al 2015 saintilan et al 2021a sandi et al 2019 the insights from the climate variability scenario simulations show that variations in flow delivery can produce a wide range of wetland conditions with the same input volume these findings have important implications for environmental water applications which are used globally to maintain the ecological integrity of large floodplain wetland complex as an example for the three simulations illustrated in fig 8b with an annual average input flow of 580 ml day a simulation with 32 of the time with flows above 500 ml day 772 resulted in severe conditions in the wetland for 12 of the time a simulation with 27 of the time with flows over 500 ml day 1991 2020 period resulted in 33 of time in severe conditions and a simulation with flows over 500 ml day 501 for 23 of the time resulted in 59 of time in severe conditions a linear regression carried out over all the climate variability simulations indicates that the percentage of time of flows above 500 ml day can explain half of the variability of the portion of time the marshes are in severe conditions see eq s1 in supplementary material our results indicate that the percentage of time that the marshes stay in severe conditions will increase under most scenarios of climate change this result is in agreement with other studies where the vulnerability of the macquarie marshes under climate change has been highlighted sandi et al 2020a xi et al 2021 the increase in time under severe conditions will affect the capacity of the wetlands to provide ecosystem services with some potentially irreversible effects on some of the supported species although in our analysis we focus on the percentage of time the marshes stay in severe conditions irrespective of the sequence of dry years there is a strong correlation r2 0 9 between that percentage and the maximum consecutive time in severe conditions see fig s1 in supplementary material many fish birds and macroinvertebrate populations cannot be sustained if a succession of years of severe conditions produces loss and fragmentation of preferred habitats interfering with their regular breeding rogers et al 2010 for species with life spans less than the dry periods extended droughts will prevent their use of the marshes as preferred habitat permanently noting that severe conditions do not occur evenly over the entire marshes our model can be used to identify areas that are more critically affected in fig 9 we show that the time the marshes are in severe condition is on average of 89 for the drier scenario 60 reduction in flows and only 37 for the wetter scenario 20 increase in flows to illustrate how these conditions could be reflected temporally and spatially a comparison of the condition and vegetation types from two simulations over all patches is presented in fig 10 the two simulations had identical initial conditions but one corresponded to the drier scenario and the other corresponded to the wetter scenario for the drier scenario there are more patches of rrg in poor and intermediate condition red and light yellow for longer periods and greater encroachment of terrestrial vegetation dark blue than in the wetter scenario moreover the total area of the wetland that is in poor intermediate condition varies over time from 9 to 80 for the drier scenario and from 9 to 65 for the wetter scenario for example by year 6 62 of the area is in adverse condition 49 of rgg in poor and intermediate condition and 13 of terrestrial vegetation encroachment for the drier scenario while only 9 is in adverse condition for the wetter scenario those adverse conditions affect specific areas of the wetlands differently with patches in the middle and northern parts of the wetland being particularly affected overall our results suggest that under climate change scenarios vegetation is expected to stay in severe condition for longer periods and over larger areas for the drier scenarios analogous to what is happening in simulation 501 in fig 8b under climate change projections longer drought periods and more extreme events are anticipated gu et al 2020 tabari 2020 whetton et al 1993 and as a result the marshes are expected to remain in severe condition for a longer time even though predictions of future distribution of droughts and floods are not currently available our results combining climate change and variability encompass a wide range of possible distributions that include those situations the macquarie marshes are already under pressure due to land reclamation for food production flow regulation cattle grazing invasion of exotic weeds and droughts whalley et al 2011 yu et al 2015 this pressure is reflected in the results for the period 1991 2020 fig 8a red point which shows that the system was in severe condition 33 of the time the current situation can be exacerbated by climate change with the drier scenario projecting an increase in the duration of severe conditions to 89 of the time higher frequency of severe conditions in the macquarie marshes is expected to reduce its function of providing habitat for a range of aquatic and terrestrial animals including the endangered australasian bittern botaurus poiciloptilus and the vulnerable murray cod maccullochella peeli kingsford and johnson 1998 oeh 2012 rayner et al 2015 climate change could also impact the benefits derived from the marshes such as food production living space and recreation organic carbon storage ground water table recharge and water purification junk et al 2013 whitaker et al 2015 we used an nlp s ecohydrologic emulator in the macquarie marshes to analyse the effects of climate variability and climate change on vegetation condition we acknowledge that our approach has some limitations and further research is necessary first our approach is based in volume outflow and volume water depth relationships that were extracted from a previously available quasi 2d hydrodynamic model for other applications these relations need to be extracted from a hydrodynamic model specifically setup for this objective or from measurements and synthetically obtained relations i e using fine resolution elevation maps as in hayashi and van der kamp 2000 both approaches requiring considerable resources including time investment second we used a simplified representation of vegetation dynamics which respond to changes of flood frequency duration and depth we acknowledge that the importance of other factors associated with future climate change such as flood timing increase in air temperature rise in evapotranspiration change in rainfall and rise in atmospheric co2 concentration need to be considered in future work third we assessed the ecological resilience capacity to recover of the vegetation based on information collected over 30 years of analysis which include about 10 years of continuous stressful conditions millennium drought however longer term effects may diminish the resilience particularly of woody vegetation for example catelotti et al 2015 found rrg dieback in areas of the macquarie marshes between 1993 and 2011 but as noted by saintilan et al 2021a those areas had been already identified as stressed in 1993 considering that the die out of long live trees under extended dry periods might be impossible to recover more severe conditions in the marshes than the ones presented in this study could occur fourth due to the characteristics of the catchment and the availability of gauged records we used input flows that are regulated and do not represent natural conditions this implies that management decisions are embedded in the input flows and different scenarios could arise from those decisions so our simulations of 7000 different scenarios also include uncertainties in the decision making however the regulation capacity of the system is limited as during heavy rain periods dam spills and unregulated tributaries flows result in extensive flooding while during extended droughts the environmental flow reserves cannot guarantee minimum inundation conditions because of that limited capacity we expect uncertainties in management to be less important than those due to climate conditions but further research should be done in order to assess the effects of management decisions in the catchment the results presented in this study show vegetation condition and uncertainties under climate change scenarios in a ramsar wetland in the semiarid region of south east australia here we highlight the importance of using a computationally efficient modelling approach that can be used to fully assess the impacts of future scenarios including their uncertainties due to climatic variability this approach can be extended to enable adaptive ecosystem management under the uncertainty of extreme events climate change and social economic development it can also be incorporated into multi objective optimization frameworks to optimize management of environmental flows gilmore et al 2009 yang 2011 5 conclusions and future work climate change is expected to put more pressure on large dryland floodplain wetlands in australia and elsewhere so it is important to quantify the extent of the degradation and its uncertainty for adaptive management of these valuable ecosystems our fast emulator allowed us to analyse the combined effects of climate variability and climate change on wetland evolution using results from 7000 30 year simulations that ran 26 000 times faster than a hydrodynamic model we found that the annual average flow and the percentage of time the flow is above a threshold of 500 ml day can be used to describe the effects of flow magnitude and distribution on wetland response low values of these two indicators result in an increase in severe conditions in the wetlands overall climate change scenarios with reduced flow showed longer times and larger areas of the wetland in severe condition and fewer episodes of vegetation recovery in contrast scenarios with flow increases did not show substantial improvement in wetland conditions decision support for wetland ecosystems that consider climate change may benefit from this methodology because the capability of carrying out multiple simulations in computationally practicable time opens up the possibility to comprehensively study management options including optimisation and trade off analysis of alternatives even though the condition of these dryland wetlands is heavily controlled by climate wetland condition is also affected by management decisions that control water allocations from upstream dam the fast emulator provides the opportunity to more thoroughly explore management options to help achieve more resilience to climate variability and change impacts

15993,viruses are important drivers of microbial community ecology and evolution influencing microbial mortality metabolism and horizontal gene transfer however the effects of viruses remain largely unknown in many environments including in drinking water systems drinking water metagenomic studies have offered a whole community perspective of bacterial impacts on water quality but have not yet considered the influences of viruses in this study we address this gap by mining viral dna sequences from publicly available drinking water metagenomes from distribution systems in six countries around the world these datasets provide a snapshot of the taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential of the global drinking water virome and provide an opportunity to investigate the effects of geography climate and drinking water treatment practices on viral diversity both environmental conditions and differences in sample processing were found to influence the viral composition using free chlorine as the residual disinfectant was associated with clear differences in viral taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential with significantly fewer viral populations and less even viral community structures than observed in distribution systems without residual disinfectant additionally drinking water viruses carry antibiotic resistance genes args as well as genes to survive oxidative stress and nitrogen limitation through this study we have demonstrated that viral communities are diverse across drinking water systems and vary with the use of residual disinfectant our

introduction in an effort to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases previous research on viruses in drinking water has focused on tracking and eliminating human viral pathogens dong et al 2010 gall

plants and distribution systems albinana gimenez et al 2006 samhan et al 2015 ye et al 2012 while research on the presence and fate of human viruses is essential for assessing drinking water quality

checkv virsorter2 and vibrant based on the community established standard for defining viral populations roux et al 2019 all viral contigs were clustered stampede clustergenomes roux and bolduc 2017 if they shared average nucleotide identity ani of 95 across 85 of the contig length viral populations in the following the annotations of the three most ubiquitous vps based on frequency of occurrence and relative abundance were examined to assess the confidence of the phage annotations of each of these these three ubiquitous vps were blasted against the nucleotide collection nt in ncbi to assess whether they matched any previously sequenced proviruses the top hits were run through checkv to identify any provirus sequences in their genome 2 5 read mapping filtered and trimmed reads were mapped to all contigs from that sample s assembly using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 and quantified using sam tools v1 11 li et al 2009 to quantify the reads mapped to the trimmed viral sequences blast v2 9 0 was used to align the trimmed viral sequences to the contigs and then reads overlapping this region were quantified using featurecounts liao et al 2014 from the subread package liao et al 2013 when more than one sequencing run was performed for a given sample the total read coverage was summed across sampling replicates 2 6 alpha and beta diversity only contigs with reads covering at least 3 kb of their length were included in diversity analyses alpha diversity measures i e richness and shannon dissimilarity were calculated using the vegan v2 5 7 package oksanen et al 2020 in r v4 0 2 r

collected in the temperate oceanic climate zone cfb köppen climate classification scheme were used to evaluate the effects of residual disinfectant use on taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential fig s1 inset this study was chosen because it provided detailed water quality parameters and was the only study to include samples from distribution systems operated without a residual disinfectant the six samples taken from the warm summer continental zone dfb köppen climate classification were excluded because they were all taken from distribution systems that use a residual disinfectant complicating the isolation of climate s effect from that of residual disinfectant additionally only samples that used free chlorine and not chloramines were included to facilitate comparison with the results presented by dai et al 2020 this reduced set of samples was used for all subsequent comparisons of water quality and residual disinfectant differences in alpha diversity between distribution systems based on residual disinfectant use were tested using the wilcoxon rank sum test additionally both the sevillano et al 2021 and dai et al 2020 samples were used to investigate the effects of water quality parameters including residual disinfectant on the viral community these two studies were chosen as the only two to include both samples with and without residual disinfectant distance

taxonomy the open reading frames orfs from dram were clustered with all full length bacterial and archaeal virus genomes from ncbi s viral reference dataset viral refseq v 85 january 2018 using vcontact2 bin jang et al 2019 clusters with at least one taxonomic assignment from vcontact2 as well as clusters found in 10 of samples were separately visualized with cytoscape v3 8 2 shannon et al 2003 the lowest common ancestor was identified for each vcontact2 cluster with a taxonomic assignment 3 results discussion to produce a snapshot of the virome in drinking water distribution systems we mined publicly available drinking water metagenomes chao et al 2013 dai et al 2020 douterelo et al 2018 garner et al 2018 jia et al 2015 ma et al 2017 2019 potgieter et al 2020 sevillano et al 2021 shi et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 table 1 summarizes the metadata for each study the majority of the samples were collected in europe 31 and asia 35 with the remainder obtained from north america 23 and africa 11 fig s1 in total 164 samples were collected from 69 distribution systems with 18 samples from systems with no residual disinfectant and 102 from systems with a residual disinfectant 46 samples are presumed to be from distribution systems using a residual disinfectant based on the typical disinfection choice of their country of origin i e china singapore south africa united kingdom united states but this could not be confirmed table s1 all samples from the same drinking water distribution system were co assembled tables s1 and s4 resulting in 729 724 contigs larger than 3 kb we then mined the assembled contigs for viral sequences identifying 62 500 viral sequences or 9 of all the contigs longer than 3 kb the proportion of viral contigs is typically not reported in studies that have mined metagenomes for viral sequences our results are in agreement with the upper range 0 3 16 of the percentage of viral sequences observed in a marine metagenomic study delong et al 2006 additionally this is consistent with our expectations that viral genomic material would represent roughly 10 of community dna given that viruses are on average an order of magnitude more abundant than their microbial hosts in most aquatic habitats while their genomes tend to be one to two orders of magnitude smaller to facilitate comparisons of the viral populations across distribution systems the viral contigs were clustered into 48 935 viral populations based on 95 sequence similarity over 85 of the contig length roux et al 2019 these viral populations allowed us to characterize the taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential of the drinking water virome as well as the geographic and treatment based factors shaping these communities 3 1 viral ecology of drinking water communities 3 1 1 drinking water viral populations are predominantly novel and heterogeneous between samples and studies we used vcontact2 to examine the evolutionary relatedness of the viral populations vps of the total 62 500 viral sequences 23 573 37 formed 7897 clusters that approximate genus level relatedness bin jang et al 2019 fig 1 a fig s3 only 778 viral clusters 10 of all viral clusters were given a definitive taxonomic assignment per the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv conventions by vcontact2 fig s4 the vast majority of these 763 out of the 778 viral clusters were assigned to families in the caudovirales order of tailed dsdna phage podoviridae 373 vps siphoviridae 284 and myoviridae 81 were the three most prevalent families of viruses identified in these samples mirroring the three dominant families in many other freshwater environments moon et al 2020 saparbaevna et al 2017 skvortsov et al 2016 zaouri et al 2020 the dominance of caudovirales among the classified vps in our study may represent compositional bias towards this viral order as the vcontact reference database is 90 caudovirales however the family classification of our vps does not reflect database bias as vcontact contains 50 siphoviridae 23 myoviridae and 15 podoviradae bin jang et al 2019 to date the vast majority of vps described in environmental viromics studies have been novel reflecting that viral databases insufficiently represent global viral diversity as well as the fact that the viral genomes reconstructed from these datasets tend to be incomplete and thus difficult to classify for instance in recent studies of the arctic ocean gregory et al 2019 honey bees deboutte et al 2020 and new york city wastewater gulino et al 2020 only 9 8 9 5 and 4 of their viral populations respectively received a taxonomic assignment only 1 of the drinking water viral populations in our study had a taxonomic assignment fig 2 a since many viruses are strongly habitat specific paez espino et al 2016 roux et al 2012 the likelihood of sequencing novel viruses from an environment poorly represented in the databases is high in addition to the lack of drinking water virome studies to date the typical source waters i e groundwater and surface water for drinking water production have been less frequently studied than marine aquatic environments kallies et al 2019 kothari et al 2021 malki et al 2020 moon et al 2020 paez espino et al 2016 roux et al 2012 skvortsov et al 2016 of the 48 935 vps 95 ani across 85 of the contig identified across all distribution systems 156 viral populations were found in more than 10 of the samples eight of these had an order level taxonomic assignment seven belonged to the caudovirales order two viral populations of myoviridae one podoviridae two siphoviridae two unassigned families and one vp belonged to the microviridae family of isometric ssdna phage in the petitvirales order fig 1b other studies have similarly found a high degree of heterogeneity with few ubiquitous viral populations across different viromes collected from similar environments e g within ecological zones in marine environments gregory et al 2019 paez espino et al 2016 roux et al 2016 the three most ubiquitous viral populations were vp 905 vp 2791 and vp 1288 fig 1c vp 2791 the most prevalent was found in 42 of the samples vp 905 and vp 2791 were classified as unknown genera within the siphoviridae family caudovirales vp 1288 did not have a taxonomic assignment at any level the top blast hits for each of the most ubiquitous vps in the ncbi nt database table s5 were each within prophages identified by checkv both vp 905 and vp 2971 were most similar based on query coverage to a sequence in blastochloris viridis fig 2a table s5 b viridis is a purple photosynthetic bacterium tsukatani et al 2015 that was isolated from a german river and has been found in other freshwaters including in the biofilm of an ultrapure supply water plant bohus et al 2010 vp 905 also matched with a similar query coverage to rhodobacter sp lpb0142 fig 2a and paracoccus contaminans vp 1288 was most similar to nitrobacter winogradskyi a nitrite oxidizing bacterium that has been found in soils as well as freshwater mellbye et al 2015 fig 2b while most of the orfs on the three contigs were not assigned a metabolic annotation fig 2 table s6 the high number of unknown and phage related genes combined with the high sequence similarity and synteny with known prophages increased the confidence that each are truly phage contigs by pairing deeply sequenced viromes with cellular metagenomes subsequent studies will build on this first report of ubiquitous viral populations in drinking water to establish who infects whom thereby leading to a more robust understanding of how viruses impact drinking water quality 3 1 2 environmental conditions and experimental design influence drinking water viral communities to evaluate the possible effects of experimental design and environmental conditions on viral community structure we tested the effects of the continent and köppen climate zone where samples were collected the filter pore size for biomass collection and the dna extraction method in contrast to differences reported between viruses sequenced from 0 1 to 20 µm and 0 1 µm fractions williamson et al 2012 our meta analysis found that filter pore size did not impact viral community structures permanova table s7 as virus sizes typically range from 0 02 to 0 3 µm the relatively large filter pore size 0 22 and 0 45 µm used across all studies in our analysis may explain why filter pore size did not affect viral community structure the other three parameters tested as well as the interaction of the dna extraction method and köppen climate zone did have a statistically significant effect on the viral community s structure permanova table s7 combined the parameters and their interactions tested explained slightly over a quarter of the variability in the system residual permanova r2 0 73 table s7 the inability to explain the full variability in beta diversity in the permanova model could reflect the unbalanced nature of the metadata e g many more samples used the maxwell 16 dna extraction system than the other three methods fig s4 as well as the importance of additional factors we additionally tested the effect of study to encompass the experimental design and environmental conditions including those not explicitly reported in all of the original metagenomics studies e g water source distribution system water qualities library preparation study was found to significantly impact the viral community structure permanova r2 0 21 p value 0 0001 in a previous meta analysis of drinking water bacterial communities study specific effects explained nearly a third of the variability among samples bautista de los santos et al 2016 the collection and processing of samples are known to have a substantial impact on the viruses identified brinkman et al 2018 dias et al 2020 hurwitz et al 2013 percival and wyn jones 2013 the low biomass of drinking water samples may make them particularly prone to the influence of study specific differences from contamination during sample processing bautista de los santos et al 2016 alternatively as most studies only examined one distribution system or focused on a single region the strong study specific effects may be partly due to local factors such as geography climate treatment regime and water source e g groundwater river water such parameters have been shown to influence the viral communities of many other environments paez espino et al 2016 to investigate the influence of water quality parameters independently from study specific effects we focused on the dai et al 2020 samples collected from the uk and netherlands and the sevillano et al 2021 samples collected from puerto rico both studies found that chlorine was a major determinant of the differences in the microbial community composition dai et al 2020 sevillano et al 2021 dai et al 2020 additionally found that do and conductivity were correlated with the microbial community structure of these samples sevillano et al 2021 found that do temperature and toc were each significantly associated with changes in microbial composition at specific sites as bacterial community structure is a critical driver of bacteriophage community structure de jonge et al 2019 gregory et al 2019 we hypothesized that these parameters would also be correlated with the viral community relatedness bray curtis dissimilarities we found that viral beta diversity i e differences in community structure between samples correlated with chlorine phosphate and nitrate concentration do conductivity water temperature ph and toc for both studies ammonia concentration was also significantly correlated for the dai et al 2020 samples fig 3 tables s8 and s9 these trends indicated that water quality parameters do likely shape the viral communities of drinking water distribution system sampling location was significantly correlated with the viral community structure of both the dai et al 2020 study permanova r2 0 33 p value 0 001 table s8 and sevillano et al 2021 study permanova r2 0 32 p value 0 0001 table s9 together with the unexplained variability in both the dai et al 2020 permanova r2 0 19 table s8 and the sevillano et al 2021 samples permanova r2 0 25 table s9 these trends indicated that unmeasured factors also likely affected the viral community structures altogether the sevillano et al 2021 and dai et al 2020 viral sequences suggest that water quality parameters are influencing the structure of viral communities independently of study specific differences in experimental design 3 1 3 systems with residual disinfectant have less diverse and less even viral communities to assess the effect of residual disinfectant on the viral communities we first assessed within sample diversity alpha diversity the average normalized viral richness was 350 820 and the average shannon evenness index was 0 28 0 10 the shannon dissimilarities for the drinking water viral populations range from 0 26 to 7 7 which is consistent with ranges reported for other freshwater sources aguirre de cárcer et al 2015 tseng et al 2013 distribution systems that used a residual disinfectant had less diverse viral communities than distribution systems that did not use a residual disinfectant this trend held for systems using both chlorine and chloramine as well as for the suspected residual disinfectant samples tukey s test padj 10 6 fig s5 further no difference was found between the chlorine and chloramine samples tukey s test padj 0 92 nor between the suspected residual disinfectant samples and either the chlorine tukey s test pad j 0 25 or chloramine tukey s test padj 0 85 samples together these trends supported our prediction that samples from studies with suspected residual disinfectant usage were indeed likely obtained from systems operated with a residual disinfectant bacterial communities in drinking water systems with residual disinfectant have been observed to have lower richness and evenness bautista de los santos et al 2016 dai et al 2020 dai et al 2020 proposed that disinfectant residuals exert a stronger selective pressure than the low phosphate and ammonia availability in distribution systems that do not use a residual disinfectant for the dai et al 2020 samples we similarly found that viral communities in drinking water distribution systems with a residual disinfectant i e free chlorine were less diverse and less even than distribution systems without a residual disinfectant wilcoxon rank sum test p values normalized richness p value 3 0 10 6 and shannon evenness index p value 0 001 fig 4 correlations between bacterial and viral diversity have been observed in a range of environments anderson et al 2017 dalcin martins et al 2018 yang et al 2019 whether residual disinfectant selects for certain viral populations in drinking water thereby reducing viral community diversity or the viral population dynamics are following those of their bacterial hosts as they are affected by residual disinfectant and other changing environmental parameters is unknown as phages impose a selective pressure on bacterial communities phages can both disrupt desirable bacterial communities during industrial processes e g yogurt production as well as be used to prevent contamination by pathogens e g to prevent milk spoilage marks and sharp 2000 based on the abundance and diversity of phages in drinking water we hypothesize that phages are an important factor influencing the stability of bacterial communities in drinking water however more systematic and deeply sequenced analyses of paired cellular and viral metagenomes is needed to better resolve virus host and infection dynamics in drinking water distribution systems and their consequences for water quality residual disinfectant is also a significant determinant of between sample bacterial community structure bautista de los santos et al 2016 dai et al 2020 e g beta diversity therefore we anticipated it to have a similar effect on viral community structure the viral communities from the dai et al 2020 study clustered based on residual disinfectant use permanova r2 0 09 p value 0 0001 fig 3a while the dai et al 2020 samples considered were all taken from the same köppen climatic zone the residual disinfectant samples were taken in the summer fall and have lower conductivities and the no residual disinfectant samples were taken during the winter spring and have higher conductivities tables s2 and s10 for this reason the differences in viral community structure may reflect the additive effect of water quality differences that reflect treatment e g chlorine phosphate do ammonia and other factors that may confound the effect of treatment such as season and water source e g temperature and conductivity both season pinto et al 2014 potgieter et al 2018 prest et al 2016 and water source assche et al 2019 roeselers et al 2015 have been shown to influence drinking water microbial communities when season and water source have been examined together systems that are groundwater fed have lacked the strong seasonal trends observed in surface water fed systems assche et al 2019 roeselers et al 2015 therefore season may have a weaker confounding effect than source water for the no residual disinfectant samples as their conductivities suggest groundwater sources douterelo et al 2018 providing an additional opportunity to consider the effect of residual disinfectant one site from the sevillano et al 2021 study gua had chlorine concentrations below the detection limit or much lower than the other sites chlorine concentration 0 05 mg l the viral community structure of the gua samples was distinct compared to the other samples permanova r2 0 18 p value 0 0002 fig 3b including those that had similar conductivities temperatures and other water quality parameters while this further supports the influence of residual disinfectant on viral community structure more studies are necessary to determine the distinct effects of residual disinfectant use on the viral communities of drinking water distribution systems separate from season and water source 3 2 the metabolic potential of drinking water viromes viral genomes often include genes necessary for replication as well as host derived auxiliary metabolic genes amgs thought to reprogram host cellular metabolism to support infection processes warwick dugdale et al 2019 characterizing and understanding the influences on the metabolic potential of drinking water viruses is therefore an essential step in understanding their influence on the cellular members of the drinking water microbiome 3 2 1 water quality parameters are correlated with differences in viral community metabolic potential the viral community metabolic potential varies with water quality parameters in similar ways to the viral community structure specifically samples clustered primarily by disinfectant status fig 5 a and all tested water quality parameters correlated with the metabolic profiles of samples from systems using residual disinfectant other than do fig 5 permanova table s11 furthermore the strong correlation between metabolic profiles and drinking water distribution system permanova r2 0 30 p value 0 001 and large degree of unexplained variability residual permanova r2 0 21 suggested that much of the metabolic variability was due to unreported water quality and treatment specific differences unlike the viral populations which were more diverse in distribution systems with no residual disinfectant there was more diversity in metabolic potential in the residual disinfectant systems wilcoxon rank sum test p value 0 03 fig s6 this may reflect an evolutionary benefit of carrying extra genes to survive the oxidative stress of residual disinfectant presence the relative abundance of ko metabolic pathway modules also differed between distribution systems that used a residual disinfectant and those that did not fig 5b table s12 viral contigs from distribution systems that did not use a residual disinfectant were enriched in genes with nucleotide metabolism annotations contrastingly viral contigs from distribution systems that used a residual disinfectant were enriched in genes involving the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins and for xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism the higher availability of genes related to these two pathway modules in residual disinfectant systems may reflect the evolutionary pressure to carry genes capable of mitigating the effects of reactive chlorine species huang et al 2021 kavagutti et al 2019 however these trends particularly the overabundance of nucleotide metabolism in no residual disinfectant systems could potentially be an artifact of the increased diversity of these samples fig 4 as more than 85 of the kos were found in less than a quarter of the samples fig s7 further studies with deeper sequencing or viral enriched genomes are necessary to robustly investigate differential abundances of molecular functions 3 2 2 drinking water viruses encode metabolic genes with the potential to augment microbial metabolic processes as is common in other environmental viromes deboutte et al 2020 gregory et al 2019 most of the predicted viral genes identified in this study were novel meaning they do not share homology with known genes in public databases as a result only 25 had a pfam annotation and 6 could be assigned a kegg orthology ko molecular function of the six most prevalent pfams two were phage structural protein families and four were phage non structural proteins fig 5c the most abundant was a caudovirus prohead serine protease pf04586 18 an enzyme involved in capsid maturation the ubiquity of viral related annotations among the most abundant pfams supports that viral contigs were successfully sorted from the majority cellular metagenomes the top four most abundant ko metabolic modules were nucleotide metabolism 44 of the reads that mapped to viral genes with ko annotations cofactors and vitamins metabolism 18 amino acid metabolism 11 and carbohydrate metabolism 10 genes related to nucleotide and amino acid metabolism are commonly abundant in viral genomes due to their importance in viral replication hurwitz et al 2015 carbohydrate metabolism genes carried by viruses may be involved in reprogramming central carbon metabolism to favor energy production necessary for viral replication howard varona et al 2020 in the oligotrophic environment of the drinking water microbiome these genes along with those encoding for proteins related to cofactor and vitamin metabolism might contribute to the survival of the bacteriophages hosts or enhance viral replication nitrogen metabolism genes are common among drinking water bacteria potgieter et al 2020 to survive the oligotrophic conditions of drinking water kooij and wielen 2013 in other nitrogen limited environments phages have carried more genes related to nitrogen cycling warwick dugdale et al 2019 similarly genes related to nitrogen metabolism were identified in the drinking water virome in this study fig s8 including carbonic anhydrase k01673 glutamine synthetase k01915 nitrate reductase nitrite oxidoreductase k00370 glutamate dehydrogenase k15371 nitric oxide reductase k04748 nitrate nitrite transporter k02575 and nitrogen fixation protein nifu k04488 the most ubiquitous nitrogen metabolism related genes were glutamine synthetase k01915 11 assemblies followed by nifu k04488 8 assemblies in addition to being part of nitrogen metabolism glutamine synthetase is also involved in amino acid metabolism the presence of viral encoded nitrogen related genes suggests that in drinking water distribution systems viruses may impact nutrient metabolism either through rewiring host metabolism to support infection or by mediating horizontal gene transfer of nutrient stress related genes warwick dugdale et al 2019 zimmerman et al 2020 to survive in drinking water systems with a residual disinfectant microorganisms must also mitigate the effects of reactive chlorine species gray et al 2013 in this study glutathione reductase k00383 and genes responsible for four of the five steps of coenzyme a biosynthesis m00120 fig s9 were identified in the viruses of distribution systems that use a residual disinfectant 59 samples in 5 studies low molecular weight thiols including glutathione and coenzyme a which maintain the reducing potential of the cytosol chesney and eaton 1996 have previously been found in bacterial genomes from drinking water distribution systems treated with chlorine dai et al 2020 douterelo et al 2018 gomez alvarez et al 2012 in other environments genes broadly involved in surviving oxidative stress have been found in phage genomes huang et al 2021 kavagutti et al 2019 and have been shown to be beneficial to viral fitness holmgren 1989 russel and model 1986 while viral genes are implicated in combating oxidative stress in distribution systems using a residual disinfectant additional research is needed to assess the role of viruses in mitigating the harmful effects of reactive chlorine species in drinking water specifically taken together the presence of genes related to nitrogen metabolism and oxidative stress mitigation on drinking water viral contigs suggest that phages may contribute to the transfer of genes that are important for microbial survival in drinking water distribution systems 3 3 opportunities for future work metagenomic analyses allow researchers to make broad assessments of microbial communities and suggest areas for more targeted studies the analyses conducted here suggest that residual disinfectant use impacts the diversity and metabolic potential of the drinking water virome however future bench scale experiments will be necessary to separate the effects of residual disinfectant from other water quality and sampling differences confounding methodological differences between studies such as dna extraction method can mask or be correlated with the factors including climate geography and treatment regime that may shape the microbial communities of drinking water while standardizing methodologies may be impossible and premature coordination between researchers could facilitate cross study comparisons bautista de los santos et al 2016 hull et al 2019 an excellent first step would be to make raw sequencing data public and report temperature water quality characteristics e g chlorine phosphate ammonia nitrate toc concentrations and biomass proxies e g atp levels cell counts as well as other metadata e g source water characteristics details of the treatment season location bautista de los santos et al 2016 yilmaz et al 2011 application of standardized spike ins such as sequins hardwick et al 2018 to drinking water microbiomes would further facilitate between study comparisons as well as reveal whether the changes in viral gene relative abundances described in this work mirror the trends in absolute abundance for the most robust assessments of the drinking water virome future studies must specifically develop sample processing methods that enrich for viruses and are optimized for the sample matrix langenfeld et al 2021 as the drinking water samples of this meta analysis were not collected with the intention of enriching for submicron viral particles the sequenced viruses may be biased towards particle associated viruses viruses actively infecting a cellular host and free viruses trapped by the chosen filter future studies designed specifically to query the viral fraction of drinking water including both dna and rna viruses and with deeper sequencing efforts are necessary to determine whether the trends described here are reflective of the full viral community to more fully capture both the drinking water viral community and their influences on bacterial communities future studies should also explore viruses in drinking water biofilms as part of this effort future work should characterize the viral genes that are on dna within viral particles as compared to extracellular dna altogether these studies will also determine the extent to which phage facilitated metabolic reprogramming or gene transfer contributes to bacterial survival in drinking water systems by connecting the drinking water virome s dynamics with that of the bacterial community improved treatment processes may become possible 4 conclusions mining drinking water metagenomes for viral sequences reveals differences in the viral community based on geography and water quality parameters more diverse and even viral communities are found in distribution systems that do not use a residual disinfectant viruses in drinking water carry genes such as those for nitrogen metabolism and chlorine stress mitigation that mirror those identified as critical for the drinking water bacterial community declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15993,viruses are important drivers of microbial community ecology and evolution influencing microbial mortality metabolism and horizontal gene transfer however the effects of viruses remain largely unknown in many environments including in drinking water systems drinking water metagenomic studies have offered a whole community perspective of bacterial impacts on water quality but have not yet considered the influences of viruses in this study we address this gap by mining viral dna sequences from publicly available drinking water metagenomes from distribution systems in six countries around the world these datasets provide a snapshot of the taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential of the global drinking water virome and provide an opportunity to investigate the effects of geography climate and drinking water treatment practices on viral diversity both environmental conditions and differences in sample processing were found to influence the viral composition using free chlorine as the residual disinfectant was associated with clear differences in viral taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential with significantly fewer viral populations and less even viral community structures than observed in distribution systems without residual disinfectant additionally drinking water viruses carry antibiotic resistance genes args as well as genes to survive oxidative stress and nitrogen limitation through this study we have demonstrated that viral communities are diverse across drinking water systems and vary with the use of residual disinfectant our findings offer directions for future research to develop a more robust understanding of how virus bacteria interactions in drinking water distribution systems affect water quality graphical abstract

introduction in an effort to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases previous research on viruses in drinking water has focused on tracking and eliminating human viral pathogens dong et al 2010 gall et al 2015 petrovich et al 2020 rao et al 1981 ye et al 2012 for example researchers have tracked specific human viruses with qpcr to understand their distribution throughout drinking water treatment plants and distribution systems albinana gimenez et al 2006 samhan et al 2015 ye et al 2012 while research on the presence and fate of human viruses is essential for assessing drinking water quality the impacts of bacterial viruses commonly referred to as bacteriophages or phages have rarely been addressed phages influence microbial populations rohwer et al 2009 suttle 2007 and biogeochemical cycling parmar et al 2017 through mortality fuhrman and noble 1995 guidi et al 2016 and by facilitating horizontal gene transfer between microorganisms and across environments rohwer et al 2009 similarly viruses likely impact both beneficial and detrimental bacteria and other microorganisms in drinking water systems that have both direct e g causing illness and indirect effects e g nitrification and corrosion on drinking water quality metagenomic studies have become critical to evaluate the cumulative effects of the drinking water microbiome on water quality hull et al 2019 liu et al 2013 past studies have shown that many factors ranging from source waters assche et al 2019 stanish et al 2016 to treatment practices bautista de los santos et al 2016 dai et al 2020 pinto et al 2012 influence the bacterial archaeal and eukaryotic inhabitants of drinking water for instance the use of residual disinfectants e g free chlorine chloramine has been connected to the selection of opportunistic pathogens feazel et al 2009 kotlarz et al 2019 liu et al 2019 vaerewijck et al 2005 the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes jia et al 2019 2015 shi et al 2012 and shaping microbial communities dai et al 2020 hull et al 2019 krishna et al 2020 wang et al 2014 at most these studies have quantified the fraction of viral sequences in a cellular metagenome brumfield et al 2020 gomez alvarez et al 2012 stamps et al 2018 this leaves fundamental information about drinking water viruses such as their taxonomic or metabolic diversity and influence on the drinking water microbiome unknown to fill similar knowledge gaps in other environments cellular metagenomes have been re examined for dna viruses revealing novel viral diversity and offering insights into viral host interactions paez espino et al 2016 roux et al 2015b taking such an approach can provide an untapped opportunity to illuminate the effects of phages on drinking water quality and safety the overall goal of this work was to characterize viral communities in drinking water distribution systems to do so we identified viral sequences from publicly available metagenomic datasets from drinking water distribution systems from around the world to assess viral taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential we further investigated the effect of study characteristics e g the type of filter used for sample processing and the dna extraction method and environmental conditions e g water quality on the structuring of the observed viral communities this study lays the groundwork for understanding the impact of viruses on the microbial communities in drinking water distribution systems 2 methodology 2 1 data collection publicly available drinking water metagenomic reads were downloaded from ncbi using the sra toolkit v2 9 6 leinonen et al 2011 table s1 sequences deposited on mg rast were directly requested from researchers only water samples that were collected from drinking water distribution systems and that were sequenced using illumina short read technology were included in our analysis excluding samples taken from within treatment plants and distribution system biofilm samples based on these criteria 164 samples were used sequencing for some samples was replicated resulting in a total of 312 sequencing runs replicate sequencing sets from the same samples were pooled during subsequent analyses sample table s1 table s1 provides information about sample processing sequencing platform and other metadata for each sample included in this study water quality parameters for the dai et al 2020 and sevillano et al 2021 samples are provided in tables s2 and s3 respectively 2 2 sequence read processing sequence reads were filtered and trimmed using fastp v0 20 1 chen et

remove contamination from vectors national center for biotechnology information 2016 2 3 assembly the filtered and processed reads from each distribution system sampling location were co assembled using metaspades v3 10 1 nurk et al 2017 assembly quality was assessed with quast v5 0 2 gurevich et al 2013 2 4 viral population identification to define viral populations putative viral contigs were identified from contigs greater than 3 kb using a strategy based on virsorter v1 0 6 roux et al 2015a virsorter2 v2 1 guo et al 2021 checkv v0 7 0 nayfach et al 2020 vibrant v1 2 1 kieft et al 2020

vibrant iii as complete high or medium by checkv iv with a virsorter2 score greater than 0 95 v with at least two hallmark viral genes from virsorter2 or vi with a virfinder score greater than 0 9

a length greater than 50 kb and no viral hallmark genes from virsorter2 it was removed from the viral list bacterial genes were excised from the edges of proviruses based on their identification by checkv virsorter2 and vibrant based on the community established standard for defining viral populations roux et al 2019 all viral contigs were clustered stampede clustergenomes roux and bolduc 2017 if they shared average nucleotide identity ani of 95 across 85 of the contig length viral populations in the following the annotations of the three most ubiquitous vps based on frequency of occurrence and relative abundance were examined to assess the confidence of the phage annotations of each of these these three ubiquitous vps were blasted against the nucleotide collection nt in ncbi to assess whether they matched any previously sequenced proviruses the top hits were run through checkv to identify any provirus sequences in their genome 2 5 read mapping filtered and trimmed reads were mapped to all contigs from that sample s assembly using bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 and quantified using sam tools v1 11 li et al 2009 to quantify the reads mapped to the trimmed viral sequences blast v2 9 0 was used to align the trimmed viral sequences to the contigs and then reads overlapping this region were quantified using featurecounts liao et al 2014 from the subread package liao et al 2013 when more than one sequencing run was performed for a given sample the total read coverage was summed across sampling replicates 2 6 alpha and beta diversity only contigs with reads covering at least 3 kb of their length were included in diversity analyses alpha diversity measures i e richness and shannon dissimilarity were calculated using the vegan v2 5 7 package oksanen et al 2020 in r v4 0 2 r

bray curtis dissimilarities study bray curtis dissimilarities residual disinfectant to avoid the confounding effects of study design and climate on diversity analyses the dai et al 2020 samples collected in the temperate oceanic climate zone cfb köppen climate classification scheme were used to evaluate the effects of residual disinfectant use on taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential fig s1 inset this study was chosen because it provided detailed water quality parameters and was the only study to include samples from distribution systems operated without a residual disinfectant the six samples taken from the warm summer continental zone dfb köppen climate classification were excluded because they were all taken from distribution systems that use a residual disinfectant complicating the isolation of climate s effect from that of residual disinfectant additionally only samples that used free chlorine and not chloramines were included to facilitate comparison with the results presented by dai et al 2020 this reduced set of samples was used for all subsequent comparisons of water quality and residual disinfectant differences in alpha diversity between distribution systems based on residual disinfectant use were tested using the wilcoxon rank sum test additionally both the sevillano et al 2021 and dai et al 2020 samples were used to investigate the effects of water quality parameters including residual disinfectant on the viral community these two studies were chosen as the only two to include both samples with and without residual disinfectant distance

taxonomy the open reading frames orfs from dram were clustered with all full length bacterial and archaeal virus genomes from ncbi s viral reference dataset viral refseq v 85 january 2018 using vcontact2 bin jang et al 2019 clusters with at least one taxonomic assignment from vcontact2 as well as clusters found in 10 of samples were separately visualized with cytoscape v3 8 2 shannon et al 2003 the lowest common ancestor was identified for each vcontact2 cluster with a taxonomic assignment 3 results discussion to produce a snapshot of the virome in drinking water distribution systems we mined publicly available drinking water metagenomes chao et al 2013 dai et al 2020 douterelo et al 2018 garner et al 2018 jia et al 2015 ma et al 2017 2019 potgieter et al 2020 sevillano et al 2021 shi et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 table 1 summarizes the metadata for each study the majority of the samples were collected in europe 31 and asia 35 with the remainder obtained from north america 23 and africa 11 fig s1 in total 164 samples were collected from 69 distribution systems with 18 samples from systems with no residual disinfectant and 102 from systems with a residual disinfectant 46 samples are presumed to be from distribution systems using a residual disinfectant based on the typical disinfection choice of their country of origin i e china singapore south africa united kingdom united states but this could not be confirmed table s1 all samples from the same drinking water distribution system were co assembled tables s1 and s4 resulting in 729 724 contigs larger than 3 kb we then mined the assembled contigs for viral sequences identifying 62 500 viral sequences or 9 of all the contigs longer than 3 kb the proportion of viral contigs is typically not reported in studies that have mined metagenomes for viral sequences our results are in agreement with the upper range 0 3 16 of the percentage of viral sequences observed in a marine metagenomic study delong et al 2006 additionally this is consistent with our expectations that viral genomic material would represent roughly 10 of community dna given that viruses are on average an order of magnitude more abundant than their microbial hosts in most aquatic habitats while their genomes tend to be one to two orders of magnitude smaller to facilitate comparisons of the viral populations across distribution systems the viral contigs were clustered into 48 935 viral populations based on 95 sequence similarity over 85 of the contig length roux et al 2019 these viral populations allowed us to characterize the taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential of the drinking water virome as well as the geographic and treatment based factors shaping these communities 3 1 viral ecology of drinking water communities 3 1 1 drinking water viral populations are predominantly novel and heterogeneous between samples and studies we used vcontact2 to examine the evolutionary relatedness of the viral populations vps of the total 62 500 viral sequences 23 573 37 formed 7897 clusters that approximate genus level relatedness bin jang et al 2019 fig 1 a fig s3 only 778 viral clusters 10 of all viral clusters were given a definitive taxonomic assignment per the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv conventions by vcontact2 fig s4 the vast majority of these 763 out of the 778 viral clusters were assigned to families in the caudovirales order of tailed dsdna phage podoviridae 373 vps siphoviridae 284 and myoviridae 81 were the three most prevalent families of viruses identified in these samples mirroring the three dominant families in many other freshwater environments moon et al 2020 saparbaevna et al 2017 skvortsov et al 2016 zaouri et al 2020 the dominance of caudovirales among the classified vps in our study may represent compositional bias towards this viral order as the vcontact reference database is 90 caudovirales however the family classification of our vps does not reflect database bias as vcontact contains 50 siphoviridae 23 myoviridae and 15 podoviradae bin jang et al 2019 to date the vast majority of vps described in environmental viromics studies have been novel reflecting that viral databases insufficiently represent global viral diversity as well as the fact that the viral genomes reconstructed from these datasets tend to be incomplete and thus difficult to classify for instance in recent studies of the arctic ocean gregory et al 2019 honey bees deboutte et al 2020 and new york city wastewater gulino et al 2020 only 9 8 9 5 and 4 of their viral populations respectively received a taxonomic assignment only 1 of the drinking water viral populations in our study had a taxonomic assignment fig 2 a since many viruses are strongly habitat specific paez espino et al 2016 roux et al 2012 the likelihood of sequencing novel viruses from an environment poorly represented in the databases is high in addition to the lack of drinking water virome studies to date the typical source waters i e groundwater and surface water for drinking water production have been less frequently studied than marine aquatic environments kallies et al 2019 kothari et al 2021 malki et al 2020 moon et al 2020 paez espino et al 2016 roux et al 2012 skvortsov et al 2016 of the 48 935 vps 95 ani across 85 of the contig identified across all distribution systems 156 viral populations were found in more than 10 of the samples eight of these had an order level taxonomic assignment seven belonged to the caudovirales order two viral populations of myoviridae one podoviridae two siphoviridae two unassigned families and one vp belonged to the microviridae family of isometric ssdna phage in the petitvirales order fig 1b other studies have similarly found a high degree of heterogeneity with few ubiquitous viral populations across different viromes collected from similar environments e g within ecological zones in marine environments gregory et al 2019 paez espino et al 2016 roux et al 2016 the three most ubiquitous viral populations were vp 905 vp 2791 and vp 1288 fig 1c vp 2791 the most prevalent was found in 42 of the samples vp 905 and vp 2791 were classified as unknown genera within the siphoviridae family caudovirales vp 1288 did not have a taxonomic assignment at any level the top blast hits for each of the most ubiquitous vps in the ncbi nt database table s5 were each within prophages identified by checkv both vp 905 and vp 2971 were most similar based on query coverage to a sequence in blastochloris viridis fig 2a table s5 b viridis is a purple photosynthetic bacterium tsukatani et al 2015 that was isolated from a german river and has been found in other freshwaters including in the biofilm of an ultrapure supply water plant bohus et al 2010 vp 905 also matched with a similar query coverage to rhodobacter sp lpb0142 fig 2a and paracoccus contaminans vp 1288 was most similar to nitrobacter winogradskyi a nitrite oxidizing bacterium that has been found in soils as well as freshwater mellbye et al 2015 fig 2b while most of the orfs on the three contigs were not assigned a metabolic annotation fig 2 table s6 the high number of unknown and phage related genes combined with the high sequence similarity and synteny with known prophages increased the confidence that each are truly phage contigs by pairing deeply sequenced viromes with cellular metagenomes subsequent studies will build on this first report of ubiquitous viral populations in drinking water to establish who infects whom thereby leading to a more robust understanding of how viruses impact drinking water quality 3 1 2 environmental conditions and experimental design influence drinking water viral communities to evaluate the possible effects of experimental design and environmental conditions on viral community structure we tested the effects of the continent and köppen climate zone where samples were collected the filter pore size for biomass collection and the dna extraction method in contrast to differences reported between viruses sequenced from 0 1 to 20 µm and 0 1 µm fractions williamson et al 2012 our meta analysis found that filter pore size did not impact viral community structures permanova table s7 as virus sizes typically range from 0 02 to 0 3 µm the relatively large filter pore size 0 22 and 0 45 µm used across all studies in our analysis may explain why filter pore size did not affect viral community structure the other three parameters tested as well as the interaction of the dna extraction method and köppen climate zone did have a statistically significant effect on the viral community s structure permanova table s7 combined the parameters and their interactions tested explained slightly over a quarter of the variability in the system residual permanova r2 0 73 table s7 the inability to explain the full variability in beta diversity in the permanova model could reflect the unbalanced nature of the metadata e g many more samples used the maxwell 16 dna extraction system than the other three methods fig s4 as well as the importance of additional factors we additionally tested the effect of study to encompass the experimental design and environmental conditions including those not explicitly reported in all of the original metagenomics studies e g water source distribution system water qualities library preparation study was found to significantly impact the viral community structure permanova r2 0 21 p value 0 0001 in a previous meta analysis of drinking water bacterial communities study specific effects explained nearly a third of the variability among samples bautista de los santos et al 2016 the collection and processing of samples are known to have a substantial impact on the viruses identified brinkman et al 2018 dias et al 2020 hurwitz et al 2013 percival and wyn jones 2013 the low biomass of drinking water samples may make them particularly prone to the influence of study specific differences from contamination during sample processing bautista de los santos et al 2016 alternatively as most studies only examined one distribution system or focused on a single region the strong study specific effects may be partly due to local factors such as geography climate treatment regime and water source e g groundwater river water such parameters have been shown to influence the viral communities of many other environments paez espino et al 2016 to investigate the influence of water quality parameters independently from study specific effects we focused on the dai et al 2020 samples collected from the uk and netherlands and the sevillano et al 2021 samples collected from puerto rico both studies found that chlorine was a major determinant of the differences in the microbial community composition dai et al 2020 sevillano et al 2021 dai et al 2020 additionally found that do and conductivity were correlated with the microbial community structure of these samples sevillano et al 2021 found that do temperature and toc were each significantly associated with changes in microbial composition at specific sites as bacterial community structure is a critical driver of bacteriophage community structure de jonge et al 2019 gregory et al 2019 we hypothesized that these parameters would also be correlated with the viral community relatedness bray curtis dissimilarities we found that viral beta diversity i e differences in community structure between samples correlated with chlorine phosphate and nitrate concentration do conductivity water temperature ph and toc for both studies ammonia concentration was also significantly correlated for the dai et al 2020 samples fig 3 tables s8 and s9 these trends indicated that water quality parameters do likely shape the viral communities of drinking water distribution system sampling location was significantly correlated with the viral community structure of both the dai et al 2020 study permanova r2 0 33 p value 0 001 table s8 and sevillano et al 2021 study permanova r2 0 32 p value 0 0001 table s9 together with the unexplained variability in both the dai et al 2020 permanova r2 0 19 table s8 and the sevillano et al 2021 samples permanova r2 0 25 table s9 these trends indicated that unmeasured factors also likely affected the viral community structures altogether the sevillano et al 2021 and dai et al 2020 viral sequences suggest that water quality parameters are influencing the structure of viral communities independently of study specific differences in experimental design 3 1 3 systems with residual disinfectant have less diverse and less even viral communities to assess the effect of residual disinfectant on the viral communities we first assessed within sample diversity alpha diversity the average normalized viral richness was 350 820 and the average shannon evenness index was 0 28 0 10 the shannon dissimilarities for the drinking water viral populations range from 0 26 to 7 7 which is consistent with ranges reported for other freshwater sources aguirre de cárcer et al 2015 tseng et al 2013 distribution systems that used a residual disinfectant had less diverse viral communities than distribution systems that did not use a residual disinfectant this trend held for systems using both chlorine and chloramine as well as for the suspected residual disinfectant samples tukey s test padj 10 6 fig s5 further no difference was found between the chlorine and chloramine samples tukey s test padj 0 92 nor between the suspected residual disinfectant samples and either the chlorine tukey s test pad j 0 25 or chloramine tukey s test padj 0 85 samples together these trends supported our prediction that samples from studies with suspected residual disinfectant usage were indeed likely obtained from systems operated with a residual disinfectant bacterial communities in drinking water systems with residual disinfectant have been observed to have lower richness and evenness bautista de los santos et al 2016 dai et al 2020 dai et al 2020 proposed that disinfectant residuals exert a stronger selective pressure than the low phosphate and ammonia availability in distribution systems that do not use a residual disinfectant for the dai et al 2020 samples we similarly found that viral communities in drinking water distribution systems with a residual disinfectant i e free chlorine were less diverse and less even than distribution systems without a residual disinfectant wilcoxon rank sum test p values normalized richness p value 3 0 10 6 and shannon evenness index p value 0 001 fig 4 correlations between bacterial and viral diversity have been observed in a range of environments anderson et al 2017 dalcin martins et al 2018 yang et al 2019 whether residual disinfectant selects for certain viral populations in drinking water thereby reducing viral community diversity or the viral population dynamics are following those of their bacterial hosts as they are affected by residual disinfectant and other changing environmental parameters is unknown as phages impose a selective pressure on bacterial communities phages can both disrupt desirable bacterial communities during industrial processes e g yogurt production as well as be used to prevent contamination by pathogens e g to prevent milk spoilage marks and sharp 2000 based on the abundance and diversity of phages in drinking water we hypothesize that phages are an important factor influencing the stability of bacterial communities in drinking water however more systematic and deeply sequenced analyses of paired cellular and viral metagenomes is needed to better resolve virus host and infection dynamics in drinking water distribution systems and their consequences for water quality residual disinfectant is also a significant determinant of between sample bacterial community structure bautista de los santos et al 2016 dai et al 2020 e g beta diversity therefore we anticipated it to have a similar effect on viral community structure the viral communities from the dai et al 2020 study clustered based on residual disinfectant use permanova r2 0 09 p value 0 0001 fig 3a while the dai et al 2020 samples considered were all taken from the same köppen climatic zone the residual disinfectant samples were taken in the summer fall and have lower conductivities and the no residual disinfectant samples were taken during the winter spring and have higher conductivities tables s2 and s10 for this reason the differences in viral community structure may reflect the additive effect of water quality differences that reflect treatment e g chlorine phosphate do ammonia and other factors that may confound the effect of treatment such as season and water source e g temperature and conductivity both season pinto et al 2014 potgieter et al 2018 prest et al 2016 and water source assche et al 2019 roeselers et al 2015 have been shown to influence drinking water microbial communities when season and water source have been examined together systems that are groundwater fed have lacked the strong seasonal trends observed in surface water fed systems assche et al 2019 roeselers et al 2015 therefore season may have a weaker confounding effect than source water for the no residual disinfectant samples as their conductivities suggest groundwater sources douterelo et al 2018 providing an additional opportunity to consider the effect of residual disinfectant one site from the sevillano et al 2021 study gua had chlorine concentrations below the detection limit or much lower than the other sites chlorine concentration 0 05 mg l the viral community structure of the gua samples was distinct compared to the other samples permanova r2 0 18 p value 0 0002 fig 3b including those that had similar conductivities temperatures and other water quality parameters while this further supports the influence of residual disinfectant on viral community structure more studies are necessary to determine the distinct effects of residual disinfectant use on the viral communities of drinking water distribution systems separate from season and water source 3 2 the metabolic potential of drinking water viromes viral genomes often include genes necessary for replication as well as host derived auxiliary metabolic genes amgs thought to reprogram host cellular metabolism to support infection processes warwick dugdale et al 2019 characterizing and understanding the influences on the metabolic potential of drinking water viruses is therefore an essential step in understanding their influence on the cellular members of the drinking water microbiome 3 2 1 water quality parameters are correlated with differences in viral community metabolic potential the viral community metabolic potential varies with water quality parameters in similar ways to the viral community structure specifically samples clustered primarily by disinfectant status fig 5 a and all tested water quality parameters correlated with the metabolic profiles of samples from systems using residual disinfectant other than do fig 5 permanova table s11 furthermore the strong correlation between metabolic profiles and drinking water distribution system permanova r2 0 30 p value 0 001 and large degree of unexplained variability residual permanova r2 0 21 suggested that much of the metabolic variability was due to unreported water quality and treatment specific differences unlike the viral populations which were more diverse in distribution systems with no residual disinfectant there was more diversity in metabolic potential in the residual disinfectant systems wilcoxon rank sum test p value 0 03 fig s6 this may reflect an evolutionary benefit of carrying extra genes to survive the oxidative stress of residual disinfectant presence the relative abundance of ko metabolic pathway modules also differed between distribution systems that used a residual disinfectant and those that did not fig 5b table s12 viral contigs from distribution systems that did not use a residual disinfectant were enriched in genes with nucleotide metabolism annotations contrastingly viral contigs from distribution systems that used a residual disinfectant were enriched in genes involving the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins and for xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism the higher availability of genes related to these two pathway modules in residual disinfectant systems may reflect the evolutionary pressure to carry genes capable of mitigating the effects of reactive chlorine species huang et al 2021 kavagutti et al 2019 however these trends particularly the overabundance of nucleotide metabolism in no residual disinfectant systems could potentially be an artifact of the increased diversity of these samples fig 4 as more than 85 of the kos were found in less than a quarter of the samples fig s7 further studies with deeper sequencing or viral enriched genomes are necessary to robustly investigate differential abundances of molecular functions 3 2 2 drinking water viruses encode metabolic genes with the potential to augment microbial metabolic processes as is common in other environmental viromes deboutte et al 2020 gregory et al 2019 most of the predicted viral genes identified in this study were novel meaning they do not share homology with known genes in public databases as a result only 25 had a pfam annotation and 6 could be assigned a kegg orthology ko molecular function of the six most prevalent pfams two were phage structural protein families and four were phage non structural proteins fig 5c the most abundant was a caudovirus prohead serine protease pf04586 18 an enzyme involved in capsid maturation the ubiquity of viral related annotations among the most abundant pfams supports that viral contigs were successfully sorted from the majority cellular metagenomes the top four most abundant ko metabolic modules were nucleotide metabolism 44 of the reads that mapped to viral genes with ko annotations cofactors and vitamins metabolism 18 amino acid metabolism 11 and carbohydrate metabolism 10 genes related to nucleotide and amino acid metabolism are commonly abundant in viral genomes due to their importance in viral replication hurwitz et al 2015 carbohydrate metabolism genes carried by viruses may be involved in reprogramming central carbon metabolism to favor energy production necessary for viral replication howard varona et al 2020 in the oligotrophic environment of the drinking water microbiome these genes along with those encoding for proteins related to cofactor and vitamin metabolism might contribute to the survival of the bacteriophages hosts or enhance viral replication nitrogen metabolism genes are common among drinking water bacteria potgieter et al 2020 to survive the oligotrophic conditions of drinking water kooij and wielen 2013 in other nitrogen limited environments phages have carried more genes related to nitrogen cycling warwick dugdale et al 2019 similarly genes related to nitrogen metabolism were identified in the drinking water virome in this study fig s8 including carbonic anhydrase k01673 glutamine synthetase k01915 nitrate reductase nitrite oxidoreductase k00370 glutamate dehydrogenase k15371 nitric oxide reductase k04748 nitrate nitrite transporter k02575 and nitrogen fixation protein nifu k04488 the most ubiquitous nitrogen metabolism related genes were glutamine synthetase k01915 11 assemblies followed by nifu k04488 8 assemblies in addition to being part of nitrogen metabolism glutamine synthetase is also involved in amino acid metabolism the presence of viral encoded nitrogen related genes suggests that in drinking water distribution systems viruses may impact nutrient metabolism either through rewiring host metabolism to support infection or by mediating horizontal gene transfer of nutrient stress related genes warwick dugdale et al 2019 zimmerman et al 2020 to survive in drinking water systems with a residual disinfectant microorganisms must also mitigate the effects of reactive chlorine species gray et al 2013 in this study glutathione reductase k00383 and genes responsible for four of the five steps of coenzyme a biosynthesis m00120 fig s9 were identified in the viruses of distribution systems that use a residual disinfectant 59 samples in 5 studies low molecular weight thiols including glutathione and coenzyme a which maintain the reducing potential of the cytosol chesney and eaton 1996 have previously been found in bacterial genomes from drinking water distribution systems treated with chlorine dai et al 2020 douterelo et al 2018 gomez alvarez et al 2012 in other environments genes broadly involved in surviving oxidative stress have been found in phage genomes huang et al 2021 kavagutti et al 2019 and have been shown to be beneficial to viral fitness holmgren 1989 russel and model 1986 while viral genes are implicated in combating oxidative stress in distribution systems using a residual disinfectant additional research is needed to assess the role of viruses in mitigating the harmful effects of reactive chlorine species in drinking water specifically taken together the presence of genes related to nitrogen metabolism and oxidative stress mitigation on drinking water viral contigs suggest that phages may contribute to the transfer of genes that are important for microbial survival in drinking water distribution systems 3 3 opportunities for future work metagenomic analyses allow researchers to make broad assessments of microbial communities and suggest areas for more targeted studies the analyses conducted here suggest that residual disinfectant use impacts the diversity and metabolic potential of the drinking water virome however future bench scale experiments will be necessary to separate the effects of residual disinfectant from other water quality and sampling differences confounding methodological differences between studies such as dna extraction method can mask or be correlated with the factors including climate geography and treatment regime that may shape the microbial communities of drinking water while standardizing methodologies may be impossible and premature coordination between researchers could facilitate cross study comparisons bautista de los santos et al 2016 hull et al 2019 an excellent first step would be to make raw sequencing data public and report temperature water quality characteristics e g chlorine phosphate ammonia nitrate toc concentrations and biomass proxies e g atp levels cell counts as well as other metadata e g source water characteristics details of the treatment season location bautista de los santos et al 2016 yilmaz et al 2011 application of standardized spike ins such as sequins hardwick et al 2018 to drinking water microbiomes would further facilitate between study comparisons as well as reveal whether the changes in viral gene relative abundances described in this work mirror the trends in absolute abundance for the most robust assessments of the drinking water virome future studies must specifically develop sample processing methods that enrich for viruses and are optimized for the sample matrix langenfeld et al 2021 as the drinking water samples of this meta analysis were not collected with the intention of enriching for submicron viral particles the sequenced viruses may be biased towards particle associated viruses viruses actively infecting a cellular host and free viruses trapped by the chosen filter future studies designed specifically to query the viral fraction of drinking water including both dna and rna viruses and with deeper sequencing efforts are necessary to determine whether the trends described here are reflective of the full viral community to more fully capture both the drinking water viral community and their influences on bacterial communities future studies should also explore viruses in drinking water biofilms as part of this effort future work should characterize the viral genes that are on dna within viral particles as compared to extracellular dna altogether these studies will also determine the extent to which phage facilitated metabolic reprogramming or gene transfer contributes to bacterial survival in drinking water systems by connecting the drinking water virome s dynamics with that of the bacterial community improved treatment processes may become possible 4 conclusions mining drinking water metagenomes for viral sequences reveals differences in the viral community based on geography and water quality parameters more diverse and even viral communities are found in distribution systems that do not use a residual disinfectant viruses in drinking water carry genes such as those for nitrogen metabolism and chlorine stress mitigation that mirror those identified as critical for the drinking water bacterial community declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

15994,the remediation of persistent organic pollutants in surface and ground water represents a major environmental challenge worldwide conventional physico chemical techniques do not efficiently remove such persistent organic pollutants and new remediation techniques are therefore required photo electro catalytic membranes represent an emerging solution that can combine photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation of contaminants along with molecular sieving herein macro porous photo electro catalytic membranes were prepared using conductive and porous stainless steel metal membranes decorated with nano coatings of semiconductor photocatalytic metal oxides tio2 and zno via atomic layer deposition producing highly conformal and stable coatings the metal semiconductor junction between the stainless steel membranes and photocatalysts provides schottky like characteristics to the coated membranes the pec membranes showed induced hydrophilicity from the nano coatings and enhanced electro chemical properties due to the schottky junction a high electron transfer rate was also induced in the coated membranes as the photocurrent efficiency increased by 4 times the photo electrocatalytic efficiency of the tio2 and zno coated membranes were demonstrated in batch and cross flow filtration reactors for the degradation of persistent organic pollutant solution offering increased degradation kinetic factors by 2 9 and 2 3 compared to photocatalysis and electrocatalysis respectively the recombination of photo induced electron and hole pairs is mitigated during the photo electrocatalytic process resulting in an enhanced catalytic performance the strategy offers outstanding perspectives to design stimuli responsive membrane materials able to sieve and degrade simultaneously toxic contaminants towards greater process integration and self cleaning operations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords persistent organic pollutants atomic layer deposition schottky like diodes photo electrocatalysis membrane catalytic reactor 1 introduction persistent organic pollutants pops released from industrial agricultural and urban anthropogenic activities represent major challenges to wastewater treatment systems kumari et al 2020 the pops have carcinogenic properties and have detrimental impact on mankind and environment ventura et al 2002 thus requiring the immediate need for the development of remediation solutions pionke and glotfelty 1990 the treatment and remediation of pops within wastewater have been historically performed with various biological chemical fenton photo fenton and catalytic degradation processes brown et al 2004 zhu et al 2001 catalytic degradation pathways are efficient and environmentally friendly due to the fact that no dangerous chemical reagents are required to carry out the degradation process komtchou et al 2017 the catalytic properties can also be incorporated on and across the membrane surface giving an advanced technology for wastewater treatment termed as catalytic membrane reactors cmrs ceramic membranes are widely employed in the cmr system for wastewater treatment because the ceramic materials do not get impaired even under extreme conditions of ph uv irradiation and temperature for instance tubular porous al2o3 membrane decorated with fe nanoparticles were employed for the degradation of diclofenac by fenton type catalytic oxidation process plakas et al 2019 the kinetic constant of diclofenac degradation using fe al2o3 ceramic membranes was 1 10 3 min 1 plakas et al 2019 commercial ceramic al2o3 membranes functionalized with photocatalysts such as tio2 nanocoating by sol gel dip coating method have been widely used in photocatalytic membrane reactor for the degradation of dyes wang et al 2012 the kinetic constant for the degradation of methyl orange solution using tio2 al2o3 membrane was up to 3 1 10 3 min 1 wang et al 2012 an increase in the degradation rate of pollutants may be achieved by coupling photocatalysis pc electrocatalysis ec and membrane filtration in a single unit referred to as photo electrocatalytic membrane reactors pecmr sacco et al 2015 the application of an external voltage on the photo electrocatalytic pec membrane employed as anode would drive the electrons from the photocatalytic layer to the conductive substrate material and ultimately to the cathodic material through the connecting wires in the power supply such a bypass of electrons delays the recombination of photo generated charge carriers on the anodic surface thus overcoming the major drawback of conventional pc garcia segura and brillas 2017 goei and lim 2014 additional electrochemical oxidation occurring on the surface of anodes also benefits through overall pollutant reduction in the pec process wang et al 2017 to date very limited study demonstrates the pec process coupled with the ceramic membranes for instance pec membranes composed of sol gel coated photocatalytic material such as γ c3n4 on conductive carbon nanotubes cnts grown on ceramic membrane such as al2o3 worked as anode while ti mesh was employed as the counter cathode which led to photo electrocatalytic degradation of phenol 5 mg l at kinetic constant of 44 7 10 3 min 1 wang et al 2017 recently ceramic electrodes of sno2 c tio2 were also fabricated from commercial ti tubes by chemical etching method to form mesoporous tio2 monolayer further decorated with lignin as carbon source for enhanced photocatalysis and sno2 layer for stability by electro deposition method the sno2 c tio2 electrode showed 90 degradation of emergent contaminants in 60 min by photo electrocatalysis process kaur et al 2021 the pec membranes using porous metal substrates such as aluminium platinum or stainless steel for deposition of a photo catalytically active semiconductor coating leads to the development of schottky like structure at the junction of metal substrate and semiconductor coating kumari et al 2022 the introduction of schottky barriers lead to efficient charge separation and enhanced transport of electrons and holes through the material subduing their recombination purkayastha et al 2020 therefore combining the pec technology with schottky like ceramic membranes is a way forward in achieving enhanced catalytic degradation of pollutants in wastewater recently tio2 doped graphene oxide nano sheets in contact with an aluminium substrate was fabricated using sono chemical synthesis purkayastha et al 2020 the schottky barrier interface between tio2 doped graphene oxide and aluminium creates a depletion region which inhibits charge recombination hence increasing the photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes at kinetic constant of 60 10 3 min 1 chen et al 2016 purkayastha et al 2020 however most of the reported methods for fabricating schottky like structures in the catalytic materials are wet chemical based processes and dip spin coating techniques which lead to non uniform thick and discrete coating of catalyst on the substrates leading to poor interface between the metal and semiconductor junction and hence low catalytic efficiency chen et al 2016 kwon et al 2018 therefore novel fabrication techniques shall be explored to ensure the production of conformal and stable coatings in nanoscale range on the substrate material green et al 2013 jain et al 2009 amongst these techniques atomic layer deposition ald is an advanced fabrication method to prepare highly stable metal oxide nano coatings with precise control over thickness of the layers interfaces and composition iqbal et al 2016 yang et al 2018 primarily applied to date to microelectronics and solar photovoltaic materials design weber et al 2018 in this work schottky like photo electrocatalytic macro porous membranes were prepared by ald using conductive and porous stainless steel membranes decorated with nanoscale coatings of semiconductor photocatalytic materials such as tio2 and zno semiconductor metal oxides such as tio2 and zno were specifically selected to benchmark the catalytic performance of schottky like tio2 and zno membranes with literature as tio2 and zno are most widely used photocatalysts the strategy demonstrated as highlighted in the manuscript does not limit itself to these metal oxides and others could be used in an equally facile manner the catalytic degradation rate was examined in batch and cross flow filtration mode to evaluate the contribution of the mixed pec process on the degradation kinetics and pathway of selected pollutants such as methylene blue mb phenol paracetamol and atrazine the synergistic effect between the photo electrocatalysis and membrane separation in cross flow filtration mode was assessed and compared which offers a unique approach to the design of stimuli responsive and self cleaning membrane materials with lower operating costs and greater performance outputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials

respectively the xrd data was acquired on x pert data collector while data processing and peak refinement was done on x pert highscore 2 4 optical and photo electrochemical characterization of fabricated pec membranes the optical band gap of the metal oxide coated ss metal membranes were calculated using uv visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs the instrument used for drs studies was an agilent cary 5000 uv visible nir spectrophotometer kumari et al 2021 the modified kubelka munk function f k m hν 2 was plotted against the energy of the irradiated light hν bahadur et al 2010 to calculate the band gap of the material by extrapolating from the area of inflection in the graph a three compartment cell with working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode was used in the electrochemical measurements the fabricated pec membranes 10 10 mm worked as the working electrode counter electrode was a platinum mesh 10 10 mm while reference electrode was a saturated calomel electrode sce the linear sweep voltammetry lsv tests were performed to investigate the oxygen evolution potential of the pec membranes the electrolyte solution to carry out the test was 0 5 m na2so4 the range of scanning voltage was set from 2 3 v at 20 mv s 1 scan rate the data was interpreted in terms of tafel plot to study the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction oer schlicht et al 2019 the photocurrent density testing of the pec membranes was evaluated on chi 660e electrochemical workstation equipped with three electrodes pec membrane as working pt mesh as counter and sce as reference electrode in a quartz cell with single compartment the electrolytic solution was 0 1 m na2so4 and the light source employed in the experiment was a xenon lamp λ 400 nm of 300 w placed at a distance of 10 cm away from quartz cell 0 5 v was applied as the bias voltage which helps in driving the flow of electrons towards counter electrode the photo current density of the membrane was

a300 9 5 12 s w spectrometer operating at x band at the room temperature the magnetic field was ranged from 3450 to 3580 g the radicals generated during the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants using tio2 and zno coated ss membrane 600 cycles was assessed by placing a small piece of coated membrane 5 5 mm into the sample cavity of the epr rig the sample cavity was further filled with 2 ml mb solution 5 ppm and 1 μl 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 0 2 mmol l solution and simultaneous uv irradiation was provided to initiate the photocatalytic reaction and in situ generation of reactive oxygen species which were detected by epr spectroscopy 2 5 membrane catalytic reactors setup 2 5 1 water filtration set up the designs of all cross flow filtration modules were generated on solidworks software and 3d printed on nanoscribe photonic professional gt2 3d printer at melbourne centre for nanofabrication the elaborated designs of the pc ec and pec modules are given in section s 1 of the supplementary information the pure water flux of bare and coated ss membranes in cross flow filtration mode was measured on 3d printed cross flow filtration modules the ss membranes were placed in the membrane cavity present across the bottom part of the filtration module the top part of the module was placed facing the membrane and further the module was sealed using screws the inlet tubing of the module was attached to the peristaltic pump and the pressure condition was varied from 0 5 2 kpa the retentate and permeate were collected in the collection containers placed over the weighing scale the weight of the streams and duration of the filtration were recorded to calculate the pure water flux of the catalytic membranes 2 5 2 photocatalytic degradation of pollutants in batch and cross flow filtration mode a uv lamp centred at a specific wavelength of 365 nm procured from shenzen bettsens china was used for the pc degradation of aqueous solution of model pollutants such as methylene blue mb phenol paracetamol and atrazine solution the irradiance of the light intensity was measured using an omnicure r2000 radiometer in the photocatalytic batch reactor represented in fig s4 a the membranes were dipped and placed at the bottom of beaker containing 10 ml aqueous solution of model pollutants the beaker was adjusted under the uv lamp such that a distance of 10 cm was maintained with the catalytic membrane prior to the photo experiments the catalytic system was kept in a dark environment for a time interval of 30 min to maintain absorption desorption equilibrium the pc degradation of mb 5 ppm was studied at four different irradiance conditions 28 41 55 and 67 mw cm 2 to optimize the most suitable irradiance conditions for catalysis the sampling of the mb solution was done after every 30 min for up to 150 min similarly the pc degradation of phenol 25 ppm paracetamol solution 5 ppm and atrazine solution 5 ppm using tio2 and zno coatings on ss membranes was carried out at 55 mw cm 2 aliquots of phenol and paracetamol solution was withdrawn every 30 min for up to 150 min and atrazine solution were withdrawn every 2 h for 10 h the schematic of cross flow filtration photocatalytic membrane reactor is shown in fig s4 b and same lamp and irradiance condition was employed as the pc batch reactor 100 ml model pollutant solution was taken in the feed tank and pumped to the module at different flow rates of 1 5 20 ml min by varying the pressure condition from 0 5 2 kpa the retentate and permeate coming from the outlet side of the module were collected separately in beakers and their volume and absorbence were recorded after the photocatalytic filtration of entire 100 ml of feed solution the retentate and permeate were mixed and used as feed for the next cycle for the flow rate of 20 ml min at 2 kpa the run time of one cycle was 6 min so the solution was re circulated for 20 cycles for about 120 min similarly for the flow rate of 1 5 ml min at 0 5 kpa the run time of one cycle was 52 min so the solution was re circulated for 3 cycles for about 156 min the rate of degradation of pollutant was calculated by monitoring the change in concentration of mixed solution of retentate and permeates over time 2 5 3 electrocatalytic degradation of pollutants in batch and cross flow filtration mode 20 ml beakers were used to carry the electrocatalytic tests in batch mode represented in fig s5 a in which the tio2 and zno coated membranes 10 25 mm were employed as the anode while titanium plate 10 25 mm was used as the cathode the distance between the anode and cathode was fixed at 20 mm the volume of aqueous solution of model pollutants such as mb phenol paracetamol and atrazine solution was 10 ml along with 100 µl of 0 1 m na2so4 as an electrolyte the ec degradation of mb solution 5 ppm using tio2 and zno series on ss membranes was carried at five different voltage conditions 0 5 1 2 5 and 15 v to optimize the most suitable voltage in terms of catalytic performance and cost effectiveness aliquots of the mb solution were collected every 30 min for up to 150 min the ec degradation of phenol 25 ppm paracetamol solution 5 ppm atrazine solution 5 ppm was carried at 5 v only the sampling of was performed every 30 min for up to 150 min in case of phenol and paracetamol degradation while for atrazine degradation aliquots were taken every 2 h for a total duration of 10 h the schematic of the cross flow filtration electrocatalytic membrane reactor is shown in fig s5 b the catalytic membrane used as the anode and the stainless steel mesh used as the counter electrode cathode sealed inside the module were connected to the positive and negative terminal of external dc power supply respectively 100 ml model pollutant solution was taken in the feed tank and pumped to the module at different flow rates of 1 5 20 ml min by varying the pressure condition from 0 5 to 2 kpa a voltage of 5 v was further applied across the electrodes to initiate electrocatalytic reactions the recirculation of solution at different flow rates was similar to that of pc filtration tests 2 5 4 photo electro catalytic degradation of pollutants in batch and cross flow filtration mode photo electro catalytic tests in batch mode represented in fig s6 a were carried under irradiation of uv light 365 nm and simultaneous voltage supply in a small beaker of 20 ml in which the fabricated tio2 and zno coated ss membranes 10 25 mm were employed as the anode while titanium plate 10 25 mm was used as cathode fixed at 20 mm distance the volume of aqueous solution of model pollutants was 10 ml along with 100 µl of 0 1 m na2so4 as an electrolyte aliquots of the mb solution phenol and paracetamol were withdrawn every 10 min for up to 120 min aliquots of atrazine solution were collected every 1 h for a total duration of 5 h the sampling time in case of pec was kept shorter as the pec degradation is faster compared to pc or ec the schematic of the cross flow filtration photo electrocatalytic membrane reactor is shown in fig s6 b photo electrocatalytic filtration test were carried under irradiation of uv light of 365 nm wavelength 55 mw cm 2 irradiance and simultaneous voltage supply of 5 v across the electrodes sealed inside the pec filtration modules 100 ml model pollutant solution was taken in the feed tank and pumped to the module at different flow rates of 1 5 20 ml min by varying the pressure condition from 0 5 to 2 kpa light irradiation and a voltage of 5 v were further applied across the electrodes to initiate photo electrocatalytic reactions the recirculation of solution was similar to that of pc and ec filtration tests the enhancement factor of pec processes over pc and ec processes was calculated by dividing the rate constant of pec degradation by sum of rate constant vales of pe and ec degradations 2 6 analytical methods to monitor the degradation kinetics of the pollutants the absorbence of mb dye phenol and paracetamol was examined at 665 275 and 240 nm respectively on a usb 2000 uv spectrometer ocean optics united states and the degradation of atrazine solution was monitored using a diode array detector coupled to a 1260 hplc system agilent technologies blackburn australia separation was achieved with a c18 column shim pack vp ods 4 6 250 mm 5 µm with a solvent flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and the total run time was 25 min the mobile phase was a gradient of water and methanol for the first 10 min the ratio between water and methanol remained 3 7 for next 10 20 min the ratio was 0 1 while during the last 5 min again the ratio was changed to 3 7 the injection volume was fixed at 20 µl while the allocated temperature of the column was 20 c and a uv detector at the wavelength of 224 nm was used for analysis 3 results and discussion the physical and photo electrochemical properties of tio2 and zno coatings on ss membranes are discussed to establish a relationship between the materials properties and the catalytic performances the degradation rates of pollutants by pc ec and pec in batch and cross flow filtration mode at optimized conditions were evaluated to determine the enhancement factors from the pec process operation and benefits arising from the nano texturation of the 2d thin film coatings 3 1 morphological and physical properties of the fabricated pec membranes the pec membranes were fabricated by depositing tio2 and zno thin coatings on ss membranes the deposition cycles were varied from 200 to 1000 to obtain various thicknesses of the catalytic layer and measured using an ellipsometer the ald cycles and thickness of tio2 and zno coatings were directly proportional to each other as shown in the fig 1 a and b respectively with the tio2 coatings exhibiting a growth per cycle gpc of 0 06 nm while the gpc of zno coatings was 0 14 nm in line with literature values for such coatings illiberi et al 2012 klesko et al 2018 the pore size of the bare ss membranes was measured on the order of 7 5 µm and pore size distributions cantered around 7 1 and 7 3 µm were obtained for the 600 cycles of tio2 and zno coated on the ss membranes respectively the ultrathin nano coatings on ss metal membranes were not expected to significantly alter the pore size of the coated membranes and the 0 2 0 4 µm reduction in pore size was attributed to both the deposition of metal oxides across the porous structures and to inherent variability expected from the bare metal membranes high resolution sem micrographs of the bare ss membrane and thin coatings of tio2 and zno metal oxides after 200 600 and 1000 deposition cycles are shown in fig 1 c and d respectively further sem micrographs are presented in the section s 3 of the supplementary information the sem micrographs in fig 1 c and d revealed that tio2 and zno coatings respectively at 200 deposition cycles gradually covered the surface of bare ss metal membranes in the form of nanoscale wrinkles bastasz and thomas 1978 the metal oxide coatings onto the ss fibres became increasingly homogenous with increasing number of deposition cycles 600 cycles and the thickness of the catalytic layer shan et al 2008 at larger deposition cycles 1000 cycles and for both tio2 and zno coatings nano clusters of metal oxide particles were found to form onto the surface of the membranes the change in morphology of the metal oxide coatings with an increasing thickness of the catalytic layer suggests the layer plus island growth mechanism as per the stranski krastanov growth model bade et al 2019 prieto and markov 2017 the nucleation of the metal oxide onto the conductive substrate surface is followed by the formation of island like structures which underwent further coalescence to form a dense connected network with empty channels and ultimately fill up of channels to form homogenous layer on the substrates sun et al 2019 profilometry was used to measure the average surface roughness of the metal oxide coatings the profilometry mappings of the tio2 and zno coatings on ss membrane are given in section s 4 of the supplementary information the variation in roughness with the thickness of the deposited tio2 and zno coatings and number of ald cycles is represented in fig 1 e and f respectively the average roughness of the metal oxide layers was of the order of 100 150 nm the trend extracted from fig 1 e and f show that with an increase in the thickness of the catalytic layer the average roughness of the coating first increased by 20 30 nm and then plateaued around 150 nm nano metric increase in the roughness may be attributed to formation of nano clusters during the deposition cycles also observed clearly in the sem micrographs the average surface roughness of bare ss metal membranes was on the order of 0 10 µm therefore further deposition of metal oxides coatings in nanoscale range was not expected to bring huge variation in the overall roughness since the metal substrate was natively rough the standard deviation values of the roughness of nano coatings also remained high which indicates that nano metric increases in the thickness of the coatings did not change the surface roughness significantly and the roughness values of each coatings are more or less in the same range as that of bare ss metal membrane suggesting conformal and homogenous deposition of the catalyst by ald maina et al 2021 the water contact angle wca of the bare ss metal membranes was 135 10 indicating poor wetting and the hydrophobic nature of the bare ss and a reduction by 20 of the contact angle was observed upon application of either the tio2 or zno coatings as shown in fig 1 e and f respectively specifically for the tio2 series the wca decreased from 132 3 to 122 1 while for the zno series it dropped to 110 2 demonstrating enhanced hydrophilicity with such ultra thin coatings favouring water diffusion across the surface of the metal support eshaghi and eshaghi 2012 the contact angle of tio2 coatings at 800 and 1000 ald cycles were 120 2 and 122 1 respectively similarly the contact angle of zno coatings at 800 and 1000 ald cycles were 103 5 and 107 2 respectively the contact angle of the metal oxide nano coatings 800 and 1000 ald cycles falls in the similar range as the standard deviation of penultimate metal oxides nano coating is higher giving a non monotonic decline of the contact angle with the increase of thickness 3 2 crystallinity and composition of the fabricated pec membranes the microstructure of the catalytic tio2 and zno coatings at various thicknesses was analysed from xrd patterns provided in the fig 2 a and b respectively the xrd spectra consistently showed the characteristic peaks of the ss membrane in both the tio2 and zno series at 43 4 51 8 and 74 9 the xrd pattern of the tio2 coatings represented in fig 2 a showed reflections arising from anatase peaks marked as a corresponding to the crystal planes 101 004 202 and 220 which confirmed the presence of this crystalline phase in the coatings xrd spectra in fig 2 b showed three diffraction peaks attributed to crystalline zno corresponding to the crystal planes 100 002 and 101 emerging at 2θ of 32 4 34 8 and 36 5 respectively chin and chao 2013 kumar et al 2014 at higher deposition cycles such as 800 and 1000 cycles the zno series show another crystalline diffraction peak from plane 110 at 2θ 57 1 indicating the development of new plane of atoms in the lattice structure due to increased thickness of the coating and formation of larger crystal size enhancing the crystallinity of the coatings both tio2 and zno series showed the most intense diffraction peak at 2θ 24 5 36 5 respectively attributed to the crystal plane 101 which was then used in the crystallite size calculation of tio2 and zno from the scherrer s equation and the values of crystallite size are given in table s1 in case of both tio2 and zno series the crystallite sizes as well as the intensity of the diffraction peaks were found to increase with the thickness of the catalytic coating indicating the formation of polycrystalline structures it is reported that with an increase in the thickness of the coating the cohesive forces acting between the catalytic coating and the substrate material decrease which in turn eliminate the pinholes or lattice imperfections in the coating ultimately leading to formation of larger crystallites and greater diffraction intensity el denglawey et al 2018 3 3 optical and photo electrochemical properties of the fabricated pec membranes the optical properties of the pec membranes fabricated by depositing tio2 and zno coatings on ss metal membranes were evaluated by calculating the band gap of the deposited catalytic coating the f k m hν 2 versus hν plots of complete tio2 and zno coated ss membranes are given in the supporting information the band gap values are given in table s2 and are represented as a function of the thickness of the coating and the number of ald cycles in fig 2 c and d for tio2 and zno coatings respectively tio2 coatings displayed the band gap value in the range of 3 2 3 6 ev which represented the existence of anatase phase of tio2 also observed in the xrd patterns zhao et al 2016 tio2 coatings with thicknesses 20 nm 200 and 400 ald cycles show a band gap value at 3 2 ev while further increases in the deposition cycles to 600 and 800 lead to an increase in band gap to 3 4 and 3 5 ev respectively and gradually saturating at 3 4 ev for 1000 cycles tio2 nano coatings of 20 nm may have pinholes being in close proximity with the electrostatic depletion layer at the junction of ss metal membranes and tio2 layer responsible for low band gaps at lower deposition cycles purkayastha et al 2020 the band gap values plateau at 3 4 ev as the thickness of the tio2 coating increased meanwhile zno coatings at different deposition cycles and thicknesses show constant band gap of 3 2 ev which proves that zno coatings were homogenous and free of any lattice imperfections that generally cause an increase or decrease in the band gap values of the same material across the series rabeh et al 2014 linear sweep voltammetry was employed to examine the electrochemistry and analyse the oxygen evolution potential of the fabricated pec membranes li et al 2015 the linear sweep voltammograms lsvs of the tio2 and zno coatings on ss membrane are given in section s 4 of the supplementary information the oxygen evolution potentials oep obtained from the lsvs are given in table s2 and graphically presented in the fig 2 c and d for tio2 and zno series respectively in case of tio2 series the oep increased from 1 3 to 1 7 ev as the thickness of the catalytic coating progressed from 10 to 31 2 nm respectively while further growth of the coating led to the saturation of the oep at 1 6 ev which was in agreement with the literature lv et al 2018 very thin coatings of tio2 20 nm may possess certain forms of inhomogeneity and dislocations which leads to differed oeps abdel rahim 1995 as also observed in case of band gap values increasing the thickness of the tio2 coating improved the electron potential for oxygen evolution high oep is desirable for wastewater treatment as it subdues the anodic oxygen evolution reaction which is considered as a side effect of the electrochemical processes causing unwanted consumption of reactive oxygen species and power loss li et al 2015 in the case of the zno series a constant oep of 1 5 ev was obtained which also seemed to be in line with the band gap observations indicating a defect free and homogenous fabrication of zno coatings jiang et al 2014 photocurrent measurements of some of the tio2 and zno series samples 200 600 and 1000 cycles were performed to analyse the opto electronic properties of the materials takahashi et al 2001 the plots of current density as a function of time for the samples from tio2 and zno series are given in fig 2 e and f respectively and the maximum photocurrent density is recorded in table s2 for the tio2 series an increase in coating thickness from 10 to 31 4 nm led to a 1 5 times increase in photocurrent density while further increase in the thickness of tio2 coating from 31 nm to 54 nm leads to a 2 fold increase in photocurrent density similarly in the case of the zno series an increase in coating thickness from 25 to 89 nm leads to a 6 times increase in photocurrent density while further increase in the thickness of zno coating from 89 to 138 nm leads to a 3 fold increase in photocurrent density therefore it can be concluded from these observations that as the thickness of the catalytic coatings increased the photocurrent density also increased such enhancement in thicker coatings may be attributed to the formation of a higher number of charger carriers electron hole pairs more efficient separation and transfer of photo induced charge carriers hu et al 2019 electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy was carried to detect the reactive oxygen species ros generated in situ during the photocatalytic reaction the epr spectra represented in fig 3 a show a hyperfine splitting of peaks of intensity 1 2 2 1 in case of both tio2 and zno coated ss membranes 600 cycles which are characteristic peaks of dmpo adduct with hydroxyl radicals dmpooh li et al 2019 song et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 six characteristic peaks of dmpo adduct with superoxide radicals dmpo o2 li et al 2019 song et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 were also obtained in case of tio2 and zno coated ss membranes 600 cycles as represented in fig 3 b therefore presence of oh and o2 during photocatalytic reaction using schottky like membranes was confirmed by epr spectroscopy assessment 3 4 batch reactor photo electrocatalytic degradation of pops 3 4 1 catalytic efficiency evaluation photo electrocatalytic pec degradation of mb 5 ppm phenol 25 ppm paracetamol 5 ppm and atrazine solution 5 ppm was carried under the irradiation of uv light 365 nm at optimized irradiance of 55 mw cm 2 and optimized voltage of 5 v the pec degradation of pollutants followed pseudo first order kinetics the pec kinetic constant for the degradation of mb dye using tio2 and zno coatings increased from 4 1 to 75 1 10 3 min 1 fig 4 a and 4 1 to 85 5 10 3 min 1 fig 4 b respectively as the thickness of the catalytic coating increased similarly the pec degradation of phenol also increased from 3 5 to 66 3 10 3 min 1 fig 4 c and 3 7 to 72 7 10 3 min 1 fig 4 d as the thickness of tio2 and zno coatings increased respectively similar results were obtained for the degradation of paracetamol and atrazine as the pec kinetic constant increased from 3 7 to 40 5 10 3 min 1 fig 4 e and 2 8 to 18 1 10 3 min 1 fig 4 g respectively as the thickness of tio2 coatings increased from 0 to 59 8 nm pec kinetic constant for the degradation of paracetamol and atrazine using zno coatings increased from 3 7 to 53 1 10 3 fig 4 f min 1 and 2 8 to 18 1 10 3 min 1 fig 4 h with increase of zno coatings from 0 to 138 nm the increase in the oep and photocurrent density with the thickness of the catalytic coatings suggested the formation of a higher number of charger carriers and more efficient separation and transfer of photo induced electron and hole pairs in the membranes with thicker coatings of tio2 at 59 8 nm and zno at 138 nm therefore the photo electrocatalytic performance increased with increase in thickness of catalytic coatings the charge transfer mechanism of schottky like materials and pec process was investigated to understand the high performance of metal oxide coated ss membranes which worked as the anode the formation of schottky like barriers occurs at the junction of metal and n type semiconducting materials when the work function ɸ m of the metal is higher the majority charge carriers in p type semiconductors are positive holes which would attract electrons from the metal side leading to the neutralization of semiconducting material teng et al 2018 therefore n type semiconducting materials are generally used in the formation of schottky like barriers the work function of a metal represents the energy required to accelerate an electron from the fermi level of the metal to vacuum khan et al 2015 since metals are by nature more conductive than oxides they exhibit a lower fermi energy efermi as compared to semiconducting materials khan et al 2015 the fermi level of semiconducting materials lies just below their conduction band and the difference between the energies of the lowest occupied conduction band cb and vacuum energy is called for semiconducting materials the electro affinity ƞsm chiarello et al 2010 as the semiconducting material and metal comes in contact during schottky like barrier generation the electrons will flow from the higher e fermi of the semiconducting material to the lower e fermi of the metal until an equilibrium stage is reached with a constant efermi across both materials called the band bending young et al 2008 the flow of electrons from the semiconducting material to the metal leads to a depletion of electrons within the semiconducting material supporting the accumulation of positive holes within the semiconducting materials but near the semiconductor metal interface gurunathan 2004 yi et al 2018 young et al 2008 meanwhile the electrons accumulate within the metal but near the very same interface to maintain electrical neutrality this mechanism leads to the formation of a depletion layer at the junction which generates a localised potential barrier for the charge carriers referred to as the schottky like barrier at this stage further transportation of electrons to the metal gets impeded the charge carriers must overcome the schottky like barrier to continue migration across the metal semiconductor interface khan et al 2015 schottky like barriers work effectively for electron trapping restricting the electron flow back to the semiconducting bulk material which in turn reduces the recombination of photo generated electron and hole pairs xiao et al 2018 therefore the schottky like properties occurring at the metal semiconductor interface further enhances the generation of reactive oxygen species ros leading to an enhancement in the catalytic performance of the materials maina et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 photo electrocatalytic membranes fabricated in this study comprised schottky like junction between ss membrane and semiconductor materials such as tio2 zno in which the former acted as conductive layer while the latter acted as photocatalytic layer garcia segura and brillas 2017 under uv irradiation at 365 nm electron and hole pairs are generated in the photocatalytic layer the conductive ss membrane remains attached to the positive terminal of the external battery upon electrification of the membranes under forward biased conditions the electrons present in the photocatalytic layer receive energy from external battery to cross the junction barrier and enter into the conductive layer the conductive ss membrane drains the photo generated electrons and transports them to the cathode via the external circuit wang et al 2017 the schottky diode leads to separation of photo induced electron hole pairs for a longer duration of time in pec process overcoming the drawback of fast recombination of charge carriers occurring in the classical photocatalysis mechanism bessegato et al 2015 thus the schottky contacts may also be referred to as the spatial separator of photo generated charge carriers the holes present on the surface of photocatalysts either directly react with the organic pollutant to mineralize it into non toxic by products or react with water molecules to produce active compounds such as hydroxyl radicals which mineralize the organics via oh mediated reactions bessegato et al 2015 the pec enhancement factor was calculated from the kinetic constants of pc ec and pec the kinetic constant values of pc ec and pec are reported in table s8 for tio2 coatings and table s10 for zno coatings on ss metal membrane the pec degradation of atrazine was enhanced by a factor of 2 9 for the 31 4 nm thick tio2 coating while for the 59 8 nm thick tio2 coating the pec degradation rate was enhanced by the factor of 2 8 similarly zno coatings with thicknesses 88 7 and 138 nm showed the pec enhancement by factors of 2 4 and 2 3 respectively for the atrazine degradation the presence of schottky barrier at the interface of metal and semiconductor enhanced the separation of electron and hole pairs in the semiconductor layer and hence the recombination of charge carriers was delayed the low electron density on semiconductor typically 1017 cm 3 as compared to metal 1022 cm 3 led to removal of electrons from the surface and bulk of the semiconductor material to the metal surface this creates depletion region containing positive charge carriers holes in the semiconductor near the interface region while metal withdraws the negatively charged electrons causing successful separation of charge carriers zhang and yates 2012 the photo generated holes transferred on the surface of the semiconductor and caused photo oxidation of water molecules into hydroxyl radicals the photo generated electrons crossed the schottky barrier under the influence of local electric field and transferred to the cathode which led to several reduction reactions such as reduction of o2 molecule to superoxide ions o2 zhang and yates 2012 hence the pec process takes full advantage of photo generated charge carriers in schottky like photo electrocatalytic membranes resulting in more than 200 increase in the catalytic performance as observed in this study the performance of the schottky like photo electrocatalytic membranes was compared with other photo electro anodic materials in literature for pec degradation of pollutants and presented in table s11 in section s 10 of the supplementary information the removal efficiency of the pollutant using pec membranes developed in this study comparatively performed better by 70 than znin2s4 c pvdf gao et al 2020 60 than pd zno c nada et al 2021 and 10 than sno2 c tio2 kaur et al 2021 electrodes therefore the pec membranes fabricated in this study elaborate the significance of development of schottky like structures with utmost control over the composition and interface at nanoscale level to impart high catalytic efficiency in the material 3 4 2 stability of the schottky like membranes the tio2 and zno coating 600 ald cycles on ss membrane were used in testing the stability of the membrane over five consecutive runs to degrade mb and atrazine solutions the total loss in degradation performance was 9 11 upon five runs for mb and atrazine solution for tio2 coating as shown in fig 5 a the microstructure of the tio2 coating 600 ald cycles on ss membrane upon five consecutive runs also revealed the presence of the anatase tio2 peak at 101 004 202 and 002 crystal plane which indicated that the crystallinity of the sample has been retained fig 5 b similarly the total loss in degradation performance using zno coating was 8 9 upon five runs for mb and atrazine solution as shown in fig 5 c the microstructure of the zno coating 600 ald cycles on ss membrane upon five consecutive runs also revealed the presence of the crystalline peaks of zno at 100 002 and 101 crystal plane indicating no loss of the crystallinity of the catalyst fig 5 d minimal loss in catalytic performance 8 11 of the metal oxide coated membranes may be attributed to the absorption of certain impurities over time such as by products of the pollutant molecules leading to a reduction in the number of active sites for catalytic reaction argyle and bartholomew 2015 3 4 3 degradation pathway for atrazine the degradation of atrazine using both tio2 and zno coatings by pc ec and pec processes was determined using hplc the hplc chromatograms after every time interval for the tio2 coatings and the zno coatings are given in section s 8 of the supplementary information the chromatograms of atrazine degradation at different time interval by pc ec and pec were evaluated to identify the most suitable degradation pathway of atrazine fig 6 a and b present the chromatograms of atrazine solution 5 ppm pc degradation at the tenth hour ec degradation at the tenth hour and pec degradation at the fifth hour of the atrazine solution using tio2 and zno coatings at 1000 deposition cycles respectively the interpretation of the chromatograms against known standards in fig 6 a and b confirmed the presence of 4 main by products of atrazine for pc and ec degradation after tenth hour of the catalytic reaction the main by products of atrazine were hydroxyatrazine ha deethylatrazine dea deethlyhydroxyatrazine deha and cyanuric acid ca as reported in literature liang et al 2016 moreira et al 2017 the degradation of atrazine proceeds via two pathways as shown in fig 6 c the first one involves a dechlorination hydroxylation reaction in which the chlorine atoms in atrazine is substituted by a hydroxyl moiety leading to the formation of ha which further undergoes alkylic oxidation to substitute ch2ch3 group with h on one of the nitrogen of ha leading to the formation of deha the second pathway involves first alkylic oxidation of atrazine to form dea followed by a dechlorination hydroxylation reaction to ultimately form deha again a dealkylation reaction occurs on alkylated nitrogen atom of deha to substitute ch2ch3 group with h which gives 2 amino groups in the new product the reaction is very unstable and immediately undergoes nitration to form a new product with 2 nitro groups a series of denitration and hydroxylation reactions lead to the formation of ca the pec degradation of atrazine after the fifth hour of the catalytic reaction for both 1000 ald cycles of tio2 and zno coating showed very small peaks in the chromatograms as represented in fig 6 a and b the small peak residents in the chromatograms of pec degradation of atrazine after fifth hour correspond to the by products of atrazine such as deethylatrazine dea deethlyhydroxyatrazine deha and cyanuric acid ca however the corresponding area of the by products dea deha and ca after 5 h of pec degradation is very small in the range of 0 05 0 08 which is almost negligible indicating complete mineralization of atrazine into non toxic by products such as co2 and h2o therefore it can be concluded that schottky like photo electrocatalytic membranes developed in this study not only showed a high catalytic performance but also led to a complete mineralization of the pollutants 3 5 photo electrocatalytic degradation of pops in cross flow filtration reactor the filtration efficiency of the membranes and residence time of the feed on and across the membranes need to be determined in the cross flow filtration modules before evaluating the catalytic degradation of pollutants 3 5 1 pure water permeation advanced module designs were carried out to optimize the feed intake and contact with the membranes as well as facilitate extraction of the permeate over time the details of the 3d printed materials and layouts are provided in section s 1 of the supplementary information the bare ss membranes with a mean pore size of the order 0 75 μm showed linear increase in the water flux from 59 9 8 9 to 486 28 l m 2 h 1 with an increase in pressure from 0 5 to 2 kpa respectively as shown in fig 7 a the pure water permeance of the membranes were also assessed from pure water fluxes and corresponding pressure condition reported in section s 11 of the supplementary information the increase in the pressure from 0 5 to 2 kpa led to linear increase in permeance from 36 400 2000 to 97 200 5600 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for bare ss membrane the reduction in the pore size of the tio2 deposited membrane 600 ald cycles from 7 5 to 7 2 μm led to decrease in the permeance by 6 15 across the studied range of pressure conditions compared to bare ss mesh similarly the zno deposited membrane 600 ald cycles with reduced pore size of 7 μm showed a steeper decrease in the permeance by 12 21 across the studied range of pressure conditions compared to bare ss mesh significant decrease in the permeance of the coated membranes confirmed the conformal deposition of the metal oxides on the surface and within the interconnecting pores of the membranes shawky et al 2011 the flow rate was calculated by monitoring the total duration of a fixed volume of the feed solution of 100 ml across the ss membranes termed as the total run time of the solution and was reported in section s 11 of the supplementary information against the applied pressure the flow rate of the solution at 2 kpa was 20 0 8 ml min which subsequently decreased to 1 9 0 4 ml min upon reducing the pressure to 0 5 kpa fig 7 b the residence time of the solution was calculated from the adapted relation given in the following eq 1 regmi et al 2020 and was reported in section s 11 of the supplementary information 1 rt m e m b r a n e a r e a c m 2 m e m b r a n e t h i c k n e s s s c m p o r o s i t y f l o w r a t e c m 3 s 1 a decrease of the flow rate of the feed solution leads to increased residence time of the pollutants on the surface and inside the interconnecting pores of the membrane chin et al 2007 lyubimenko et al 2019 the residence time at 20 ml min flow rate was 1 8 0 2 min and the slower flow rate of 1 9 0 4 ml min led to the residence time of 19 5 1 1 min fig 7 b 3 5 2 pop adsorption and system conditioning prior to the catalytic reactions filtration of 5 ppm mb solution was performed in dark to examine the solute adsorption capacity of the ss membranes and the adsorption values are reported in section 11 of the supplementary information the equivalent feed mass was 0 5 mg for 5 ppm mb solution going inside the reactor the mass of mb after filtration from the bare ss membranes in dark was 0 29 0 015 mg in the retentate fraction and 0 16 0 004 mg in the permeate fraction the total mass of the mb on the outlet side after filtration was 0 45 0 01 mg which was subtracted from the equivalent feed mass 0 5 mg and the calculated adsorbed mass of mb on the bare ss membrane was 0 05 0 01 mg similarly the adsorbed mb mass on the tio2 and zno coated ss membranes 600 ald cycles was 0 05 0 01 and 0 06 0 01 mg respectively represented in fig 7 c therefore the solute adsorption capacities of the bare and coated ss membranes were deemed low in range of 0 05 0 06 mg previously reported values for the adsorption capacity of tio2 coated ultrafiltration alumina membranes were also very low and on the order of 0 02 mg per 0 5 mg feed mass for mb dye athanasekou et al 2015 3 5 3 cross flow pec performance evaluation the photocatalytic electrocatalytic and photo electrocatalytic efficiency of the membranes in cross flow operation were determined at different residence times as reported in section s 12 of the supplementary information and graphically represented in fig 7 d e and f respectively an increase of the residence time from 1 8 0 2 to 19 5 1 1 min led to a 2 times increase of the kinetic constant of photocatalytic degradation of mb dye from 12 2 0 2 to 24 1 0 2 10 3 min 1 for tio2 coated ss membranes and 13 8 0 2 to 27 4 0 2 10 3 min 1 for the zno coated ss membranes 600 ald cycles the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the membranes in the cross flow filtration reactor for removal of mb dye was comparable to the other catalytic membranes in literature a g c3n4 carbon membrane prepared via cvd showed kinetic constant of 14 8 10 3 min 1 for photocatalytic degradation of mb in flow through reactor dou et al 2019 a zno impregnated polymeric membrane led to photocatalytic degradation assisted filtration of mb with kinetic constant 11 3 10 3 min 1 abu dalo et al 2021 similarly electrocatalytic degradation of mb dye using single metal oxide coated ss membranes also showed an increase of the ec kinetic constant from 5 1 0 1to 9 1 0 2 10 3 min 1 for tio2 coated ss membranes and from 6 6 0 3 to 10 8 0 1 10 3 min 1 for zno coated ss membranes with increasing residence time the longer residence times lead to lower flux of the feed solution providing enough time to the pollutant molecules in feed to interact with the reactive oxygen species generated across the membrane on the external stimulus of light electricity to undergo redox reactions tio2 carbon membrane employed as anode for the electrocatalytic degradation of phenols showed 4 time increase of the kinetic constant with increase of residence time from 0 6 to 5 4 min wang et al 2014 another tio2 carbon membrane exhibited an increase of the cod removal rate from 49 to 78 of the mb dye solution as the residence time increased from 3 to 12 min qaseem et al 2020 the photo electrocatalytic process in cross flow filtration mode is represented in the fig 8 a the variation in the kinetic constant of photo electrocatalytic degradation of mb dye with increase of residence time were calculated and graphically represented in fig 7 f the pec kinetic constant increased by the factor of 2 1 times from 20 2 0 1 to 42 1 0 9 10 3 min 1 for tio2 coated ss membranes and from 23 0 1 6 to 44 8 2 9 10 3 min 1 for the zno coated ss membranes with an increase of the residence time from 1 8 0 2 to 19 5 1 1 min as presented in fig 7 g the enhanced mass transfer of the reactant molecules through the pores of the membranes under pressure in the cross flow filtration mode further promotes the contact between the pollutant and catalytically active sites on and across the pores of the membranes in the pec process chin et al 2011 the creation of catalytically active sites at the bulk of the membranes due to diffusion of photo generated electrons at schottky like junction and simultaneous electrification of the entire membrane led to sharp enhancements of the degradation kinetic constants fig 8 b and c wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 the pec degradation of mb in cross flow filtration mode was enhanced by a factor of 1 2 over pc and ec processes for the 31 4 nm thick tio2 coating similarly zno coatings with thickness 88 7 nm showed the pec enhancement by factor of 1 3 over pc and ec processes for the mb degradation higher production of charge carriers was achieved due to simultaneous irradiation of light and intensification of the local electric field in the photo electrocatalysis assisted filtration processes leading to enhancement of the pec performance the membranes also showed constant permeance and degradation performance over 3 consecutive cycles exhibiting stable filtration and pop remediation capability over time a recently developed wo3 stainless steel nylon pec membrane employed in flow reactor reported the pec degradation of reactive red dye with relatively lower kinetic constant of 21 10 3 min 1 compared to the current study martins et al 2020 similarly a znin2s4 c pvdf pec membrane in cross flow filtration mode was reported to degrade the tetracycline 4 mg l solution at the kinetic constant of 16 6 10 3 min 1 gao et al 2020 therefore the pec filtration performance of literature was relatively lower compared to the present work with degradation kinetic constant of 44 8 2 9 10 3 min 1 because mostly polymeric base substrates have been employed in the fabrication of composite pec membranes which retards the conductivity the membranes in pec process the present study employed the electrically conductive stainless steel membranes which supports easy flow of electrons across the membranes leading to creation of higher number of active sites for catalysis and hence better performance the overall faraday efficiency f e of the pec cross flow filtration system for the degradation of mb dye was calculated using the formula given in eq 2 2 f e n f c m o l e s i a m p e r e t s e c 100 where n number of electrons involved in the degradation of one molecule of pollutant f faraday constant 96 500 c mole 1 c concentration of pollutant consumed in the photo electrocatalytic degradation process mole i current flowing through the system t total duration of photo electrocatalysis the number of electrons involved in the degradation of one molecule of mb dye is 7 as per the most commonly reported degradation pathway of the mb dye in literature wang et al 2018 the concentration of mb dye consumed in the photo electrocatalysis process using tio2 coated ss membranes 1000 ald cycles after 156 min was 4 89 mg l or 0 015 mol similarly the concentration of mb dye consumed in the photo electrocatalysis process using zno coated ss membranes 1000 ald cycles after 156 min was 4 98 mg l or 0 016 mol the current flowing through the system at 5 v voltage supply was 2 ma and the total duration of the photo electrocatalytic experiment was 152 min therefore the pec photo anodic membrane developed in the present work yielded overall faradaic efficiency of 55 7 and 59 3 for photo electrocatalysis process using tio2 and zno coated ss membranes 1000 ald cycles respectively the faradic efficiency of electrochemical degradation of nitrates using titanium electrode was in the range of 40 70 depending on the input current density exhibits that the result obtained in the present work is comparable to the literature mcenaney et al 2020 4 conclusions and prospects schottky like photo electrocatalytic membranes were successfully prepared via atomic layer deposition for the remediation of atrazine from aqueous solutions in cross flow separation the pore size and surface texture of the ultra thin coatings could be controlled across the bare ss membranes to offer increased roughness thus providing higher number of active sites on the surface to carry out catalytic reactions and enhanced hydrophilicity leading facilitating adsorption of pollutants with the surface of the membranes the enhancement of the photo electrochemical properties of the pec membranes with a 3 fold increase in the photocurrent density led to the formation of a higher number of electron hole pairs and more efficient separation and transfer of photo induced charge carriers in the catalytic layers the cumulative effects of the pec process and improved material properties for such schottky like membranes supported an increase in the atrazine degradation rate by over 200 supporting complete mineralization the performance of the advanced membrane materials were also demonstrated in cross flow filtration mode by varying the operation parameters such as pressure flow rate and residence time innovative approaches to develop fabrication strategies of such schottky like materials across electrically conductive nano porous membranes should be further explored to counter the limitations of the large pore size of the conductive metals membranes and generate super reactive membranes able to sieve and degrade toxic contaminants at high efficiency future work involving either more reactive semi conductors doping the material with transition metal cations to reduce the band gap and enable visible light

15994,the remediation of persistent organic pollutants in surface and ground water represents a major environmental challenge worldwide conventional physico chemical techniques do not efficiently remove such persistent organic pollutants and new remediation techniques are therefore required photo electro catalytic membranes represent an emerging solution that can combine photocatalytic and electrocatalytic degradation of contaminants along with molecular sieving herein macro porous photo electro catalytic membranes were prepared using conductive and porous stainless steel metal membranes decorated with nano coatings of semiconductor photocatalytic metal oxides tio2 and zno via atomic layer deposition producing highly conformal and stable coatings the metal semiconductor junction between the stainless steel membranes and photocatalysts provides schottky like characteristics to the coated membranes the pec membranes showed induced hydrophilicity from the nano coatings and enhanced electro chemical properties due to the schottky junction a high electron transfer rate was also induced in the coated membranes as the photocurrent efficiency increased by 4 times the photo electrocatalytic efficiency of the tio2 and zno coated membranes were demonstrated in batch and cross flow filtration reactors for the degradation of persistent organic pollutant solution offering increased degradation kinetic factors by 2 9 and 2 3 compared to photocatalysis and electrocatalysis respectively the recombination of photo induced electron and hole pairs is mitigated during the photo electrocatalytic process resulting in an enhanced catalytic performance the strategy offers outstanding perspectives to design stimuli responsive membrane materials able to sieve and degrade simultaneously toxic contaminants towards greater process integration and self cleaning operations graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords persistent organic pollutants atomic

activities represent major challenges to wastewater treatment systems kumari et al 2020 the pops have carcinogenic properties and have detrimental impact on mankind and environment ventura et al 2002 thus requiring the immediate need for the development of remediation solutions pionke and glotfelty 1990 the treatment and remediation of pops within wastewater have been historically performed with various biological chemical fenton photo fenton and catalytic degradation processes brown et al 2004 zhu et al 2001 catalytic degradation pathways are efficient and environmentally friendly due to the fact that no dangerous chemical reagents are required to carry out the degradation process komtchou et al 2017 the catalytic properties can also be incorporated on and across the membrane surface giving an advanced technology for wastewater treatment termed as catalytic membrane reactors cmrs ceramic membranes are widely employed in the cmr system for wastewater treatment because the ceramic materials do not get impaired even under extreme conditions of ph uv irradiation and temperature for instance tubular porous al2o3 membrane decorated with fe nanoparticles were employed for the degradation of diclofenac by fenton type catalytic oxidation process plakas et al 2019 the kinetic constant of diclofenac degradation using fe al2o3 ceramic membranes was 1 10 3 min 1 plakas et al 2019 commercial ceramic al2o3 membranes functionalized with photocatalysts such as tio2 nanocoating by sol gel dip coating method have been widely used in photocatalytic membrane reactor for the degradation of dyes wang et al 2012 the kinetic constant for the degradation of methyl orange solution using tio2 al2o3 membrane was up to 3 1 10 3 min 1 wang et al 2012 an increase in the degradation rate of pollutants may be achieved by coupling photocatalysis pc electrocatalysis ec and membrane filtration in a single unit referred to as photo electrocatalytic membrane reactors pecmr sacco et al 2015 the application of an external voltage on the photo electrocatalytic pec membrane employed as anode would drive the electrons from the photocatalytic layer to the conductive substrate material and ultimately to the cathodic material through the connecting wires in the power supply such a bypass of electrons delays the recombination of photo generated charge carriers on the anodic surface thus overcoming the major drawback of conventional pc garcia segura and brillas 2017 goei and lim 2014 additional electrochemical oxidation occurring on the surface of anodes also benefits through overall pollutant reduction in the pec process wang et al 2017 to date very limited study demonstrates the pec process coupled with the ceramic membranes for instance pec membranes composed of sol gel coated photocatalytic material such as γ c3n4 on conductive carbon nanotubes cnts grown on ceramic membrane such as al2o3 worked as anode while ti mesh was employed as the counter cathode which led to photo electrocatalytic degradation of phenol 5 mg l at kinetic constant of 44 7 10 3 min 1 wang et al 2017 recently ceramic electrodes of sno2 c tio2 were also fabricated from commercial ti tubes by chemical etching method to form mesoporous tio2 monolayer further decorated with lignin as carbon source for enhanced photocatalysis and sno2 layer for stability by electro deposition method the sno2 c tio2 electrode showed 90 degradation of emergent contaminants in 60 min by photo electrocatalysis process kaur et al 2021 the pec membranes using porous metal substrates such as aluminium platinum or stainless steel for deposition of a photo catalytically active semiconductor coating leads to the development of schottky like structure at the junction of metal substrate and semiconductor coating kumari et al 2022 the introduction of schottky barriers lead to efficient charge separation and enhanced transport of electrons and holes through the material subduing their recombination purkayastha et al 2020 therefore combining the pec technology with schottky like ceramic membranes is a way forward in achieving enhanced catalytic degradation of pollutants in wastewater recently tio2 doped graphene oxide nano sheets in contact with an aluminium substrate was fabricated using sono chemical synthesis purkayastha et al 2020 the schottky barrier interface between tio2 doped graphene oxide and aluminium creates a depletion region which inhibits charge recombination hence increasing the photocatalytic degradation of azo dyes at kinetic constant of 60 10 3 min 1 chen et al 2016 purkayastha et al 2020 however most of the reported methods for fabricating schottky like structures in the catalytic materials are wet chemical based processes and dip spin coating techniques which lead to non uniform thick and discrete coating of catalyst on the substrates leading to poor interface between the metal and semiconductor junction and hence low catalytic efficiency chen et al 2016 kwon et al 2018 therefore novel fabrication techniques shall be explored to ensure the production of conformal and stable coatings in nanoscale range on the substrate material green et al 2013 jain et al 2009 amongst these techniques atomic layer deposition ald is an advanced fabrication method to prepare highly stable metal oxide nano coatings with precise control over thickness of the layers interfaces and composition iqbal et al 2016 yang et al 2018 primarily applied to date to microelectronics and solar photovoltaic materials design weber et al 2018 in this work schottky like photo electrocatalytic macro porous membranes were prepared by ald using conductive and porous stainless steel membranes decorated with nanoscale coatings of semiconductor photocatalytic materials such as tio2 and zno semiconductor metal oxides such as tio2 and zno were specifically selected to benchmark the catalytic performance of schottky like tio2 and zno membranes with literature as tio2 and zno are most widely used photocatalysts the strategy demonstrated as highlighted in the manuscript does not limit itself to these metal oxides and others could be used in an equally facile manner the catalytic degradation rate was examined in batch and cross flow filtration mode to evaluate the contribution of the mixed pec process on the degradation kinetics and pathway of selected pollutants such as methylene blue mb phenol paracetamol and atrazine the synergistic effect between the photo electrocatalysis and membrane separation in cross flow filtration mode was assessed and compared

an agilent cary 5000 uv visible nir spectrophotometer kumari et al 2021 the modified kubelka munk function f k m hν 2 was plotted against the energy of the irradiated light hν bahadur et al 2010 to calculate the band gap of the material by extrapolating from the area of inflection in the graph a three compartment cell with working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode was used in the electrochemical measurements the fabricated pec membranes 10 10 mm worked as the working electrode counter electrode was a platinum mesh 10 10 mm while reference electrode was a saturated calomel

a300 9 5 12 s w spectrometer operating at x band at the room temperature the magnetic field was ranged from 3450 to 3580 g the radicals generated during the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants using tio2 and zno coated ss membrane 600 cycles was assessed by placing a small piece of coated membrane 5 5 mm into the sample cavity of the epr rig the sample cavity was further filled with 2 ml mb solution 5 ppm and 1 μl 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 0 2 mmol l solution and simultaneous uv irradiation was provided to initiate the photocatalytic reaction and in situ generation of reactive oxygen species which were detected by epr spectroscopy 2 5 membrane catalytic reactors setup 2 5 1 water filtration set up the designs of all cross flow filtration modules were generated on solidworks software and 3d printed on nanoscribe photonic professional gt2 3d printer at melbourne centre for nanofabrication the elaborated designs of the pc ec and pec modules are given in section s

tubing of the module was attached to the peristaltic pump and the pressure condition was varied from 0 5 2 kpa the retentate and permeate were collected in the collection containers placed over the weighing scale the weight of the streams and duration of the filtration were recorded to calculate the pure water flux of the catalytic membranes 2 5 2 photocatalytic degradation of pollutants in batch and cross flow filtration mode a uv lamp centred at a specific wavelength of 365 nm procured from shenzen bettsens china was used for the pc degradation of aqueous solution of model pollutants such as methylene blue mb phenol paracetamol and atrazine solution the irradiance of the light intensity was measured using an omnicure r2000 radiometer in the photocatalytic batch reactor represented in fig s4 a the membranes were dipped and placed at the bottom of beaker containing 10 ml aqueous solution of model pollutants the beaker was adjusted under the uv lamp such that a distance of 10 cm was maintained with the catalytic membrane prior to the photo experiments the catalytic system was kept in a dark environment for a time interval of 30 min to maintain absorption desorption equilibrium the pc degradation of mb 5 ppm was studied at four different irradiance conditions 28 41 55 and 67 mw cm 2 to optimize the most suitable irradiance conditions for catalysis the sampling of the mb solution was done after every 30 min for up to 150 min similarly the pc degradation of phenol 25 ppm paracetamol solution 5 ppm and atrazine solution 5 ppm using tio2 and zno coatings on ss membranes was carried out at 55 mw cm 2 aliquots of phenol and paracetamol solution was withdrawn every 30 min for up to 150 min and atrazine solution were withdrawn every 2 h for 10 h the schematic of cross flow filtration photocatalytic membrane reactor is shown in fig s4 b and same lamp and irradiance condition was employed as the pc batch reactor 100 ml model pollutant solution was taken in the feed tank and pumped to the module at different flow rates of 1 5 20 ml min by varying the pressure condition from 0 5 2 kpa the retentate and permeate coming from the outlet side of the module were collected separately in beakers and their volume and absorbence were recorded after the photocatalytic filtration of entire 100 ml of feed solution the retentate and permeate were mixed and used as feed for the next cycle for the flow rate of 20 ml min at 2 kpa the run time of one cycle was 6 min so the solution was re circulated for 20 cycles for about 120 min similarly for the flow rate of 1 5 ml min at 0 5 kpa the run time of one cycle was 52 min so the solution was re circulated for 3 cycles for about 156 min the rate of degradation of pollutant was calculated by monitoring the change in concentration of mixed solution of retentate and permeates over time 2 5 3 electrocatalytic degradation of pollutants in batch and cross flow filtration mode 20 ml beakers were used to carry the electrocatalytic tests in batch mode represented in fig s5 a in which the tio2 and zno coated membranes 10 25 mm were employed as the anode while titanium plate 10 25 mm was used as the cathode the distance between the anode and cathode was fixed at 20 mm the volume of aqueous solution of model pollutants such as mb phenol paracetamol and atrazine solution was 10 ml along with 100 µl of 0 1 m na2so4 as an electrolyte the ec degradation of mb solution 5 ppm using tio2 and zno series on ss membranes was carried at five different voltage conditions 0 5 1 2 5 and 15 v to optimize the most suitable voltage in terms of catalytic performance and cost effectiveness aliquots of the mb solution were collected every 30 min for up to 150 min the ec degradation of phenol 25 ppm paracetamol solution 5 ppm atrazine solution 5 ppm was carried at 5 v only the sampling of was performed every 30 min for up to 150 min in case of phenol and paracetamol degradation while for atrazine degradation aliquots were taken every 2 h for a total duration of 10 h the schematic of the cross flow filtration electrocatalytic membrane reactor is shown in fig s5 b the catalytic membrane used as the anode and the stainless steel mesh used as the counter electrode cathode sealed inside the module were connected to the positive and negative terminal of external dc power supply respectively 100 ml model pollutant solution was taken in the feed tank and pumped to the module at different flow rates of 1 5 20 ml min by varying the pressure condition from 0 5 to 2 kpa a voltage of 5 v was further applied across the electrodes to initiate electrocatalytic reactions the recirculation of solution at different flow rates was similar to that of pc filtration tests 2 5 4 photo electro catalytic degradation of pollutants in batch and cross flow filtration mode photo electro catalytic tests in batch mode represented in fig s6 a were carried under irradiation of uv light 365 nm and simultaneous voltage supply in a small beaker of 20 ml in which the fabricated tio2 and zno coated ss membranes 10 25 mm were employed as the anode while titanium plate 10 25 mm was used as cathode fixed at 20 mm distance the volume of aqueous solution of model pollutants was 10 ml along with 100 µl of 0 1 m na2so4 as an electrolyte aliquots of the mb solution phenol and paracetamol were withdrawn every 10 min for up to 120 min aliquots of atrazine solution were collected every 1 h for a total duration of 5 h the sampling time in case of pec was kept shorter as the pec degradation is faster compared to pc or ec the schematic of the cross flow filtration photo electrocatalytic membrane reactor is shown in fig s6 b photo electrocatalytic filtration test were carried under irradiation of uv light of 365 nm wavelength 55 mw cm 2 irradiance and simultaneous voltage supply of 5 v across the electrodes sealed inside the pec filtration modules 100 ml model pollutant solution was taken in the feed tank and pumped to the module at different flow rates of 1 5 20 ml min by varying the pressure condition from 0 5 to 2 kpa light irradiation and a voltage of 5 v were further applied across the electrodes to initiate photo electrocatalytic reactions the recirculation of solution was similar to that of pc and ec filtration tests the enhancement factor of pec processes over pc and ec processes was calculated by dividing the rate constant of pec degradation by sum of rate constant vales of pe and ec degradations 2 6 analytical methods to monitor the degradation kinetics of the pollutants the absorbence of mb dye phenol and paracetamol was examined at 665 275 and 240 nm respectively on a usb 2000 uv spectrometer ocean optics united states and the degradation of atrazine solution was monitored using a diode array detector coupled to a 1260 hplc system agilent technologies blackburn australia separation was achieved with a c18 column shim pack vp ods 4 6 250 mm 5 µm with a solvent flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and the total run time was 25 min the mobile phase was a gradient of water and methanol for the first 10 min the ratio between water and methanol remained 3 7 for next 10 20 min the ratio was 0 1 while during the last 5 min again the ratio was changed to 3 7 the injection volume was fixed at 20 µl while the allocated temperature of the column was 20 c and a uv detector at the wavelength of 224 nm was used for analysis 3 results and discussion the physical and photo electrochemical properties of tio2 and zno coatings on ss membranes are discussed to establish a relationship between the materials properties and the catalytic performances the degradation rates of pollutants by pc ec and pec in batch and cross flow filtration mode at optimized conditions were evaluated to determine the enhancement factors from the pec process operation and benefits arising from the nano texturation of the 2d thin film coatings 3 1 morphological and physical properties of the fabricated pec membranes the pec membranes were fabricated by depositing tio2 and zno thin coatings on ss membranes the deposition cycles were varied from 200 to 1000 to obtain various thicknesses of the catalytic layer and measured using an ellipsometer the ald cycles and thickness of tio2 and zno coatings were directly proportional to each other as shown in the fig 1 a and b respectively with the tio2 coatings exhibiting a growth per cycle gpc of 0 06 nm while the gpc of zno coatings was 0 14 nm in line with literature values for such coatings illiberi et al 2012 klesko et al 2018 the pore size of the bare ss membranes was measured on the order of 7 5 µm and pore size distributions cantered around 7 1 and 7 3 µm were obtained for the 600 cycles of tio2 and zno coated on the ss membranes respectively the ultrathin nano coatings on ss metal membranes were not expected to significantly alter the pore size of the coated membranes and the 0 2 0 4 µm reduction in pore size was attributed to both the deposition of metal oxides across the porous structures and to inherent variability expected from the bare metal membranes high resolution sem micrographs of the bare ss membrane and thin coatings of tio2 and zno metal oxides after 200 600 and 1000 deposition cycles are shown in fig 1 c and d respectively further sem micrographs are presented in the section s 3 of the supplementary information the sem micrographs in fig 1 c and d revealed that tio2 and zno coatings respectively at 200 deposition cycles gradually covered the surface of bare ss metal membranes in the form of nanoscale wrinkles bastasz and thomas 1978 the metal oxide coatings onto the ss fibres became increasingly homogenous with increasing number of deposition cycles 600 cycles and the thickness of the catalytic layer shan et al 2008 at larger deposition cycles 1000 cycles and for both tio2 and zno coatings nano clusters of metal oxide particles were found to form onto the surface of the membranes the change in morphology of the metal oxide coatings with an increasing thickness of the catalytic layer suggests the layer plus island growth mechanism as per the stranski krastanov growth model bade et al 2019 prieto and markov 2017 the nucleation of the metal oxide onto the conductive substrate surface is followed by the formation of island like structures which underwent further coalescence to form a dense connected network with empty channels and ultimately fill up of channels to form homogenous layer on the substrates sun et al 2019 profilometry was used to measure the average surface roughness of the metal oxide coatings the profilometry mappings of the tio2 and zno coatings on ss membrane are given in section s 4 of the supplementary information the variation in roughness with the thickness of the deposited tio2 and zno coatings and number of ald cycles is represented in fig 1 e and f respectively the average roughness of the metal oxide layers was of the order of 100 150 nm the trend extracted from fig 1 e and f show that with an increase in the thickness of the catalytic layer the average roughness of the coating first increased by 20 30 nm and then plateaued around 150 nm nano metric increase in the roughness may be attributed to formation of nano clusters during the deposition cycles also observed clearly in the sem micrographs the average surface roughness of bare ss metal membranes was on the order of 0 10 µm therefore further deposition of metal oxides coatings in nanoscale range was not expected to bring huge variation in the overall roughness since the metal substrate was natively rough the standard deviation values of the roughness of nano coatings also remained high which indicates that nano metric increases in the thickness of the coatings did not change the surface roughness significantly and the roughness values of each coatings are more or less in the same range as that of bare ss metal membrane suggesting conformal and homogenous deposition of the catalyst by ald maina et al 2021 the water contact angle wca of the bare ss metal membranes was 135 10 indicating poor wetting and the hydrophobic nature of the bare ss and a reduction by 20 of the contact angle was observed upon application of either the tio2 or zno coatings as shown in fig 1 e and f respectively specifically for the tio2 series the wca decreased from 132 3 to 122 1 while for the zno series it dropped to 110 2 demonstrating enhanced hydrophilicity with such ultra thin coatings favouring water diffusion across the surface of the metal support eshaghi and eshaghi 2012 the contact angle of tio2 coatings at 800 and 1000 ald cycles were 120 2 and 122 1 respectively similarly the contact angle of zno coatings at 800 and 1000 ald cycles were 103 5 and 107 2 respectively the contact angle of the metal oxide nano coatings 800 and 1000 ald cycles falls in the similar range as the standard deviation of penultimate metal oxides nano coating is higher giving a non monotonic decline of the contact angle with the increase of thickness 3 2 crystallinity and composition of the fabricated pec membranes the microstructure of the catalytic tio2 and zno coatings at various thicknesses was analysed from xrd patterns provided in the fig 2 a and b respectively the xrd spectra consistently showed the characteristic peaks of the ss membrane in both the tio2 and zno series at 43 4 51 8 and 74 9 the xrd pattern of the tio2 coatings represented in fig 2 a showed reflections arising from anatase peaks marked as a corresponding to the crystal planes 101 004 202 and 220 which confirmed the presence of this crystalline phase in the coatings xrd spectra in fig 2 b showed three diffraction peaks attributed to crystalline zno corresponding to the crystal planes 100 002 and 101 emerging at 2θ of 32 4 34 8 and 36 5 respectively chin and chao 2013 kumar et al 2014 at higher deposition cycles such as 800 and 1000 cycles the zno series show another crystalline diffraction peak from plane 110 at 2θ 57 1 indicating the development of new plane of atoms in the lattice structure due to increased thickness of the coating and formation of larger crystal size enhancing the crystallinity of the coatings both tio2 and zno series showed the most intense diffraction peak at 2θ 24 5 36 5 respectively attributed to the crystal plane 101 which was then used in the crystallite size calculation of tio2 and zno from the scherrer s equation and the values of crystallite size are given in table s1 in case of both tio2 and zno series the crystallite sizes as well as the intensity of the diffraction peaks were found to increase with the thickness of the catalytic coating indicating the formation of polycrystalline structures it is reported that with an increase in the thickness of the coating the cohesive forces acting between the catalytic coating and the substrate material decrease which in turn eliminate the pinholes or lattice imperfections in the coating ultimately leading to formation of larger crystallites and greater diffraction intensity el denglawey et al 2018 3 3 optical and photo electrochemical properties of the fabricated pec membranes the optical properties of the pec membranes fabricated by depositing tio2 and zno coatings on ss metal membranes were evaluated by calculating the band gap of the deposited catalytic coating the f k m hν 2 versus hν plots of complete tio2 and zno coated ss membranes are given in the supporting information the band gap values are given in table s2 and are represented as a function of the thickness of the coating and the number of ald cycles in fig 2 c and d for tio2 and zno coatings respectively tio2 coatings displayed the band gap value in the range of 3 2 3 6 ev which represented the existence of anatase phase of tio2 also observed in the xrd patterns zhao et al 2016 tio2 coatings with thicknesses 20 nm 200 and 400 ald cycles show a band gap value at 3 2 ev while further increases in the deposition cycles to 600 and 800 lead to an increase in band gap to 3 4 and 3 5 ev respectively and gradually saturating at 3 4 ev for 1000 cycles tio2 nano coatings of 20 nm may have pinholes being in close proximity with the electrostatic depletion layer at the junction of ss metal membranes and tio2 layer responsible for low band gaps at lower deposition cycles purkayastha et al 2020 the band gap values plateau at 3 4 ev as the thickness of the tio2 coating increased meanwhile zno coatings at different deposition cycles and thicknesses show constant band gap of 3 2 ev which proves that zno coatings were homogenous and free of any lattice imperfections that generally cause an increase or decrease in the band gap values of the same material across the series rabeh et al 2014 linear sweep voltammetry was employed to examine the electrochemistry and analyse the oxygen evolution potential of the fabricated pec membranes li et al 2015 the linear sweep voltammograms lsvs of the tio2 and zno coatings on ss membrane are given in section s 4 of the supplementary information the oxygen evolution potentials oep obtained from the lsvs are given in table s2 and graphically presented in the fig 2 c and d for tio2 and zno series respectively in case of tio2 series the oep increased from 1 3 to 1 7 ev as the thickness of the catalytic coating progressed from 10 to 31 2 nm respectively while further growth of the coating led to the saturation of the oep at 1 6 ev which was in agreement with the literature lv et al 2018 very thin coatings of tio2 20 nm may possess certain forms of inhomogeneity and dislocations which leads to differed oeps abdel rahim 1995 as also observed in case of band gap values increasing the thickness of the tio2 coating improved the electron potential for oxygen evolution high oep is desirable for wastewater treatment as it subdues the anodic oxygen evolution reaction which is considered as a side effect of the electrochemical processes causing unwanted consumption of reactive oxygen species and power loss li et al 2015 in the case of the zno series a constant oep of 1 5 ev was obtained which also seemed to be in line with the band gap observations indicating a defect free and homogenous fabrication of zno coatings jiang et al 2014 photocurrent measurements of some of the tio2 and zno series samples 200 600 and 1000 cycles were performed to analyse the opto electronic properties of the materials takahashi et al 2001 the plots of current density as a function of time for the samples from tio2 and zno series are given in fig 2 e and f respectively and the maximum photocurrent density is recorded in table s2 for the tio2 series an increase in coating thickness from 10 to 31 4 nm led to a 1 5 times increase in photocurrent density while further increase in the thickness of tio2 coating from 31 nm to 54 nm leads to a 2 fold increase in photocurrent density similarly in the case of the zno series an increase in coating thickness from 25 to 89 nm leads to a 6 times increase in photocurrent density while further increase in the thickness of zno coating from 89 to 138 nm leads to a 3 fold increase in photocurrent density therefore it can be concluded from these observations that as the thickness of the catalytic coatings increased the photocurrent density also increased such enhancement in thicker coatings may be attributed to the formation of a higher number of charger carriers electron hole pairs more efficient separation and transfer of photo induced charge carriers hu et al 2019 electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy was carried to detect the reactive oxygen species ros generated in situ during the photocatalytic reaction the epr spectra represented in fig 3 a show a hyperfine splitting of peaks of intensity 1 2 2 1 in case of both tio2 and zno coated ss membranes 600 cycles which are characteristic peaks of dmpo adduct with hydroxyl radicals dmpooh li et al 2019 song et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 six characteristic peaks of dmpo adduct with superoxide radicals dmpo o2 li et al 2019 song et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 were also obtained in case of tio2 and zno coated ss membranes 600 cycles as represented in fig 3 b therefore presence of oh and o2 during photocatalytic reaction using schottky like membranes was confirmed by epr spectroscopy assessment 3 4 batch reactor photo electrocatalytic degradation of pops 3 4 1 catalytic efficiency evaluation photo electrocatalytic pec degradation of mb 5 ppm phenol 25 ppm paracetamol 5 ppm and atrazine solution 5 ppm was carried under the irradiation of uv light 365 nm at optimized irradiance of 55 mw cm 2 and optimized voltage of 5 v the pec degradation of pollutants followed pseudo first order kinetics the pec kinetic constant for the degradation of mb dye using tio2 and zno coatings increased from 4 1 to 75 1 10 3 min 1 fig 4 a and 4 1 to 85 5 10 3 min 1 fig 4 b respectively as the thickness of the catalytic coating increased similarly the pec degradation of phenol also increased from 3 5 to 66 3 10 3 min 1 fig 4 c and 3 7 to 72 7 10 3 min 1 fig 4 d as the thickness of tio2 and zno coatings increased respectively similar results were obtained for the degradation of paracetamol and atrazine as the pec kinetic constant increased from 3 7 to 40 5 10 3 min 1 fig 4 e and 2 8 to 18 1 10 3 min 1 fig 4 g respectively as the thickness of tio2 coatings increased from 0 to 59 8 nm pec kinetic constant for the degradation of paracetamol and atrazine using zno coatings increased from 3 7 to 53 1 10 3 fig 4 f min 1 and 2 8 to 18 1 10 3 min 1 fig 4 h with increase of zno coatings from 0 to 138 nm the increase in the oep and photocurrent density with the thickness of the catalytic coatings suggested the formation of a higher number of charger carriers and more efficient separation and transfer of photo induced electron and hole pairs in the membranes with thicker coatings of tio2 at 59 8 nm and zno at 138 nm therefore the photo electrocatalytic performance increased with increase in thickness of catalytic coatings the charge transfer mechanism of schottky like materials and pec process was investigated to understand the high performance of metal oxide coated ss membranes which worked as the anode the formation of schottky like barriers occurs at the junction of metal and n type semiconducting materials when the work function ɸ m of the metal is higher the majority charge carriers in p type semiconductors are positive holes which would attract electrons from the metal side leading to the neutralization of semiconducting material teng et al 2018 therefore n type semiconducting materials are generally used in the formation of schottky like barriers the work function of a metal represents the energy required to accelerate an electron from the fermi level of the metal to vacuum khan et al 2015 since metals are by nature more conductive than oxides they exhibit a lower fermi energy efermi as compared to semiconducting materials khan et al 2015 the fermi level of semiconducting materials lies just below their conduction band and the difference between the energies of the lowest occupied conduction band cb and vacuum energy is called for semiconducting materials the electro affinity ƞsm chiarello et al 2010 as the semiconducting material and metal comes in contact during schottky like barrier generation the electrons will flow from the higher e fermi of the semiconducting material to the lower e fermi of the metal until an equilibrium stage is reached with a constant efermi across both materials called the band bending young et al 2008 the flow of electrons from the semiconducting material to the metal leads to a depletion of electrons within the semiconducting material supporting the accumulation of positive holes within the semiconducting materials but near the semiconductor metal interface gurunathan 2004 yi et al 2018 young et al 2008 meanwhile the electrons accumulate within the metal but near the very same interface to maintain electrical neutrality this mechanism leads to the formation of a depletion layer at the junction which generates a localised potential barrier for the charge carriers referred to as the schottky like barrier at this stage further transportation of electrons to the metal gets impeded the charge carriers must overcome the schottky like barrier to continue migration across the metal semiconductor interface khan et al 2015 schottky like barriers work effectively for electron trapping restricting the electron flow back to the semiconducting bulk material which in turn reduces the recombination of photo generated electron and hole pairs xiao et al 2018 therefore the schottky like properties occurring at the metal semiconductor interface further enhances the generation of reactive oxygen species ros leading to an enhancement in the catalytic performance of the materials maina et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 photo electrocatalytic membranes fabricated in this study comprised schottky like junction between ss membrane and semiconductor materials such as tio2 zno in which the former acted as conductive layer while the latter acted as photocatalytic layer garcia segura and brillas 2017 under uv irradiation at 365 nm electron and hole pairs are generated in the photocatalytic layer the conductive ss membrane remains attached to the positive terminal of the external battery upon electrification of the membranes under forward biased conditions the electrons present in the photocatalytic layer receive energy from external battery to cross the junction barrier and enter into the conductive layer the conductive ss membrane drains the photo generated electrons and transports them to the cathode via the external circuit wang et al 2017 the schottky diode leads to separation of photo induced electron hole pairs for a longer duration of time in pec process overcoming the drawback of fast recombination of charge carriers occurring in the classical photocatalysis mechanism bessegato et al 2015 thus the schottky contacts may also be referred to as the spatial separator of photo generated charge carriers the holes present on the surface of photocatalysts either directly react with the organic pollutant to mineralize it into non toxic by products or react with water molecules to produce active compounds such as hydroxyl radicals which mineralize the organics via oh mediated reactions bessegato et al 2015 the pec enhancement factor was calculated from the kinetic constants of pc ec and pec the kinetic constant values of pc ec and pec are reported in table s8 for tio2 coatings and table s10 for zno coatings on ss metal membrane the pec degradation of atrazine was enhanced by a factor of 2 9 for the 31 4 nm thick tio2 coating while for the 59 8 nm thick tio2 coating the pec degradation rate was enhanced by the factor of 2 8 similarly zno coatings with thicknesses 88 7 and 138 nm showed the pec enhancement by factors of 2 4 and 2 3 respectively for the atrazine degradation the presence of schottky barrier at the interface of metal and semiconductor enhanced the separation of electron and hole pairs in the semiconductor layer and hence the recombination of charge carriers was delayed the low electron density on semiconductor typically 1017 cm 3 as compared to metal 1022 cm 3 led to removal of electrons from the surface and bulk of the semiconductor material to the metal surface this creates depletion region containing positive charge carriers holes in the semiconductor near the interface region while metal withdraws the negatively charged electrons causing successful separation of charge carriers zhang and yates 2012 the photo generated holes transferred on the surface of the semiconductor and caused photo oxidation of water molecules into hydroxyl radicals the photo generated electrons crossed the schottky barrier under the influence of local electric field and transferred to the cathode which led to several reduction reactions such as reduction of o2 molecule to superoxide ions o2 zhang and yates 2012 hence the pec process takes full advantage of photo generated charge carriers in schottky like photo electrocatalytic membranes resulting in more than 200 increase in the catalytic performance as observed in this study the performance of the schottky like photo electrocatalytic membranes was compared with other photo electro anodic materials in literature for pec degradation of pollutants and presented in table s11 in section s 10 of the supplementary information the removal efficiency of the pollutant using pec membranes developed in this study comparatively performed better by 70 than znin2s4 c pvdf gao et al 2020 60 than pd zno c nada et al 2021 and 10 than sno2 c tio2 kaur et al 2021 electrodes therefore the pec membranes fabricated in this study elaborate the significance of development of schottky like structures with utmost control over the composition and interface at nanoscale level to impart high catalytic efficiency in the material 3 4 2 stability of the schottky like membranes the tio2 and zno coating 600 ald cycles on ss membrane were used in testing the stability of the membrane over five consecutive runs to degrade mb and atrazine solutions the total loss in degradation performance was 9 11 upon five runs for mb and atrazine solution for tio2 coating as shown in fig 5 a the microstructure of the tio2 coating 600 ald cycles on ss membrane upon five consecutive runs also revealed the presence of the anatase tio2 peak at 101 004 202 and 002 crystal plane which indicated that the crystallinity of the sample has been retained fig 5 b similarly the total loss in degradation performance using zno coating was 8 9 upon five runs for mb and atrazine solution as shown in fig 5 c the microstructure of the zno coating 600 ald cycles on ss membrane upon five consecutive runs also revealed the presence of the crystalline peaks of zno at 100 002 and 101 crystal plane indicating no loss of the crystallinity of the catalyst fig 5 d minimal loss in catalytic performance 8 11 of the metal oxide coated membranes may be attributed to the absorption of certain impurities over time such as by products of the pollutant molecules leading to a reduction in the number of active sites for catalytic reaction argyle and bartholomew 2015 3 4 3 degradation pathway for atrazine the degradation of atrazine using both tio2 and zno coatings by pc ec and pec processes was determined using hplc the hplc chromatograms after every time interval for the tio2 coatings and the zno coatings are given in section s 8 of the supplementary information the chromatograms of atrazine degradation at different time interval by pc ec and pec were evaluated to identify the most suitable degradation pathway of atrazine fig 6 a and b present the chromatograms of atrazine solution 5 ppm pc degradation at the tenth hour ec degradation at the tenth hour and pec degradation at the fifth hour of the atrazine solution using tio2 and zno coatings at 1000 deposition cycles respectively the interpretation of the chromatograms against known standards in fig 6 a and b confirmed the presence of 4 main by products of atrazine for pc and ec degradation after tenth hour of the catalytic reaction the main by products of atrazine were hydroxyatrazine ha deethylatrazine dea deethlyhydroxyatrazine deha and cyanuric acid ca as reported in literature liang et al 2016 moreira et al 2017 the degradation of atrazine proceeds via two pathways as shown in fig 6 c the first one involves a dechlorination hydroxylation reaction in which the chlorine atoms in atrazine is substituted by a hydroxyl moiety leading to the formation of ha which further undergoes alkylic oxidation to substitute ch2ch3 group with h on one of the nitrogen of ha leading to the formation of deha the second pathway involves first alkylic oxidation of atrazine to form dea followed by a dechlorination hydroxylation reaction to ultimately form deha again a dealkylation reaction occurs on alkylated nitrogen atom of deha to substitute ch2ch3 group with h which gives 2 amino groups in the new product the reaction is very unstable and immediately undergoes nitration to form a new product with 2 nitro groups a series of denitration and hydroxylation reactions lead to the formation of ca the pec degradation of atrazine after the fifth hour of the catalytic reaction for both 1000 ald cycles of tio2 and zno coating showed very small peaks in the chromatograms as represented in fig 6 a and b the small peak residents in the chromatograms of pec degradation of atrazine after fifth hour correspond to the by products of atrazine such as deethylatrazine dea deethlyhydroxyatrazine deha and cyanuric acid ca however the corresponding area of the by products dea deha and ca after 5 h of pec degradation is very small in the range of 0 05 0 08 which is almost negligible indicating complete mineralization of atrazine into non toxic by products such as co2 and h2o therefore it can be concluded that schottky like photo electrocatalytic membranes developed in this study not only showed a high catalytic performance but also led to a complete mineralization of the pollutants 3 5 photo electrocatalytic degradation of pops in cross flow filtration reactor the filtration efficiency of the membranes and residence time of the feed on and across the membranes need to be determined in the cross flow filtration modules before evaluating the catalytic degradation of pollutants 3 5 1 pure water permeation advanced module designs were carried out to optimize the feed intake and contact with the membranes as well as facilitate extraction of the permeate over time the details of the 3d printed materials and layouts are provided in section s 1 of the supplementary information the bare ss membranes with a mean pore size of the order 0 75 μm showed linear increase in the water flux from 59 9 8 9 to 486 28 l m 2 h 1 with an increase in pressure from 0 5 to 2 kpa respectively as shown in fig 7 a the pure water permeance of the membranes were also assessed from pure water fluxes and corresponding pressure condition reported in section s 11 of the supplementary information the increase in the pressure from 0 5 to 2 kpa led to linear increase in permeance from 36 400 2000 to 97 200 5600 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 for bare ss membrane the reduction in the pore size of the tio2 deposited membrane 600 ald cycles from 7 5 to 7 2 μm led to decrease in the permeance by 6 15 across the studied range of pressure conditions compared to bare ss mesh similarly the zno deposited membrane 600 ald cycles with reduced pore size of 7 μm showed a steeper decrease in the permeance by 12 21 across the studied range of pressure conditions compared to bare ss mesh significant decrease in the permeance of the coated membranes confirmed the conformal deposition of the metal oxides on the surface and within the interconnecting pores of the membranes shawky et al 2011 the flow rate was calculated by monitoring the total duration of a fixed volume of the feed solution of 100 ml across the ss membranes termed as the total run time of the solution and was reported in section s 11 of the supplementary information against the applied pressure the flow rate of the solution at 2 kpa was 20 0 8 ml min which subsequently decreased to 1 9 0 4 ml min upon reducing the pressure to 0 5 kpa fig 7 b the residence time of the solution was calculated from the adapted relation given in the following eq 1 regmi et al 2020 and was reported in section s 11 of the supplementary information 1 rt m e m b r a n e a r e a c m 2 m e m b r a n e t h i c k n e s s s c m p o r o s i t y f l o w r a t e c m 3 s 1 a decrease of the flow rate of the feed solution leads to increased residence time of the pollutants on the surface and inside the interconnecting pores of the membrane chin et al 2007 lyubimenko et al 2019 the residence time at 20 ml min flow rate was 1 8 0 2 min and the slower flow rate of 1 9 0 4 ml min led to the residence time of 19 5 1 1 min fig 7 b 3 5 2 pop adsorption and system conditioning prior to the catalytic reactions filtration of 5 ppm mb solution was performed in dark to examine the solute adsorption capacity of the ss membranes and the adsorption values are reported in section 11 of the supplementary information the equivalent feed mass was 0 5 mg for 5 ppm mb solution going inside the reactor the mass of mb after filtration from the bare ss membranes in dark was 0 29 0 015 mg in the retentate fraction and 0 16 0 004 mg in the permeate fraction the total mass of the mb on the outlet side after filtration was 0 45 0 01 mg which was subtracted from the equivalent feed mass 0 5 mg and the calculated adsorbed mass of mb on the bare ss membrane was 0 05 0 01 mg similarly the adsorbed mb mass on the tio2 and zno coated ss membranes 600 ald cycles was 0 05 0 01 and 0 06 0 01 mg respectively represented in fig 7 c therefore the solute adsorption capacities of the bare and coated ss membranes were deemed low in range of 0 05 0 06 mg previously reported values for the adsorption capacity of tio2 coated ultrafiltration alumina membranes were also very low and on the order of 0 02 mg per 0 5 mg feed mass for mb dye athanasekou et al 2015 3 5 3 cross flow pec performance evaluation the photocatalytic electrocatalytic and photo electrocatalytic efficiency of the membranes in cross flow operation were determined at different residence times as reported in section s 12 of the supplementary information and graphically represented in fig 7 d e and f respectively an increase of the residence time from 1 8 0 2 to 19 5 1 1 min led to a 2 times increase of the kinetic constant of photocatalytic degradation of mb dye from 12 2 0 2 to 24 1 0 2 10 3 min 1 for tio2 coated ss membranes and 13 8 0 2 to 27 4 0 2 10 3 min 1 for the zno coated ss membranes 600 ald cycles the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the membranes in the cross flow filtration reactor for removal of mb dye was comparable to the other catalytic membranes in literature a g c3n4 carbon membrane prepared via cvd showed kinetic constant of 14 8 10 3 min 1 for photocatalytic degradation of mb in flow through reactor dou et al 2019 a zno impregnated polymeric membrane led to photocatalytic degradation assisted filtration of mb with kinetic constant 11 3 10 3 min 1 abu dalo et al 2021 similarly electrocatalytic degradation of mb dye using single metal oxide coated ss membranes also showed an increase of the ec kinetic constant from 5 1 0 1to 9 1 0 2 10 3 min 1 for tio2 coated ss membranes and from 6 6 0 3 to 10 8 0 1 10 3 min 1 for zno coated ss membranes with increasing residence time the longer residence times lead to lower flux of the feed solution providing enough time to the pollutant molecules in feed to interact with the reactive oxygen species generated across the membrane on the external stimulus of light electricity to undergo redox reactions tio2 carbon membrane employed as anode for the electrocatalytic degradation of phenols showed 4 time increase of the kinetic constant with increase of residence time from 0 6 to 5 4 min wang et al 2014 another tio2 carbon membrane exhibited an increase of the cod removal rate from 49 to 78 of the mb dye solution as the residence time increased from 3 to 12 min qaseem et al 2020 the photo electrocatalytic process in cross flow filtration mode is represented in the fig 8 a the variation in the kinetic constant of photo electrocatalytic degradation of mb dye with increase of residence time were calculated and graphically represented in fig 7 f the pec kinetic constant increased by the factor of 2 1 times from 20 2 0 1 to 42 1 0 9 10 3 min 1 for tio2 coated ss membranes and from 23 0 1 6 to 44 8 2 9 10 3 min 1 for the zno coated ss membranes with an increase of the residence time from 1 8 0 2 to 19 5 1 1 min as presented in fig 7 g the enhanced mass transfer of the reactant molecules through the pores of the membranes under pressure in the cross flow filtration mode further promotes the contact between the pollutant and catalytically active sites on and across the pores of the membranes in the pec process chin et al 2011 the creation of catalytically active sites at the bulk of the membranes due to diffusion of photo generated electrons at schottky like junction and simultaneous electrification of the entire membrane led to sharp enhancements of the degradation kinetic constants fig 8 b and c wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 the pec degradation of mb in cross flow filtration mode was enhanced by a factor of 1 2 over pc and ec processes for the 31 4 nm thick tio2 coating similarly zno coatings with thickness 88 7 nm showed the pec enhancement by factor of 1 3 over pc and ec processes for the mb degradation higher production of charge carriers was achieved due to simultaneous irradiation of light and intensification of the local electric field in the photo electrocatalysis assisted filtration processes leading to enhancement of the pec performance the membranes also showed constant permeance and degradation performance over 3 consecutive cycles exhibiting stable filtration and pop remediation capability over time a recently developed wo3 stainless steel nylon pec membrane employed in flow reactor reported the pec degradation of reactive red dye with relatively lower kinetic constant of 21 10 3 min 1 compared to the current study martins et al 2020 similarly a znin2s4 c pvdf pec membrane in cross flow filtration mode was reported to degrade the tetracycline 4 mg l solution at the kinetic constant of 16 6 10 3 min 1 gao et al 2020 therefore the pec filtration performance of literature was relatively lower compared to the present work with degradation kinetic constant of 44 8 2 9 10 3 min 1 because mostly polymeric base substrates have been employed in the fabrication of composite pec membranes which retards the conductivity the membranes in pec process the present study employed the electrically conductive stainless steel membranes which supports easy flow of electrons across the membranes leading to creation of higher number of active sites for catalysis and hence better performance the overall faraday efficiency f e of the pec cross flow filtration system for the degradation of mb dye was calculated using the formula given in eq 2 2 f e n f c m o l e s i a m p e r e t s e c 100 where n number of electrons involved in the degradation of one molecule of pollutant f faraday constant 96 500 c mole 1 c concentration of pollutant consumed in the photo electrocatalytic degradation process mole i current flowing through the system t total duration of photo electrocatalysis the number of electrons involved in the degradation of one molecule of mb dye is 7 as per the most commonly reported degradation pathway of the mb dye in literature wang et al 2018 the concentration of mb dye consumed in the photo electrocatalysis process using tio2 coated ss membranes 1000 ald cycles after 156 min was 4 89 mg l or 0 015 mol similarly the concentration of mb dye consumed in the photo electrocatalysis process using zno coated ss membranes 1000 ald cycles after 156 min was 4 98 mg l or 0 016 mol the current flowing through the system at 5 v voltage supply was 2 ma and the total duration of the photo electrocatalytic experiment was 152 min therefore the pec photo anodic membrane developed in the present work yielded overall faradaic efficiency of 55 7 and 59 3 for photo electrocatalysis process using tio2 and zno coated ss membranes 1000 ald cycles respectively the faradic efficiency of electrochemical degradation of nitrates using titanium electrode was in the range of 40 70 depending on the input current density exhibits that the result obtained in the present work is comparable to the literature mcenaney et al 2020 4 conclusions and prospects schottky like photo electrocatalytic membranes were successfully prepared via atomic layer deposition for the remediation of atrazine from aqueous solutions in cross flow separation the pore size and surface texture of the ultra thin coatings could be controlled across the bare ss membranes to offer increased roughness thus providing higher number of active sites on the surface to carry out catalytic reactions and enhanced hydrophilicity leading facilitating adsorption of pollutants with the surface of the membranes the enhancement of the photo electrochemical properties of the pec membranes with a 3 fold increase in the photocurrent density led to the formation of a higher number of electron hole pairs and more efficient separation and transfer of photo induced charge carriers in the catalytic layers the cumulative effects of the pec process and improved material properties for such schottky like membranes supported an increase in the atrazine degradation rate by over 200 supporting complete mineralization the performance of the advanced membrane materials were also demonstrated in cross flow filtration mode by varying the operation parameters such as pressure flow rate and residence time innovative approaches to develop fabrication strategies of such schottky like materials across electrically conductive nano porous membranes should be further explored to counter the limitations of the large pore size of the conductive metals membranes and generate super reactive membranes able to sieve and degrade toxic contaminants at high efficiency future work involving either more reactive semi conductors doping the material with transition metal cations to reduce the band gap and enable visible light activation or refined interfacial defect engineering could lead to further advances declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgement this work was
