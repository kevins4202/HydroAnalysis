some new investigated materials such as mesoporous nanocomposites which show better characteristics but the separation problem is regarded as one of the biggest constraints of these new generation adsorbents it is challenging to remove the adsorbents from wastewater when the adsorption process is over and the discharging of adsorbents into the environment can cause future problems dai et al 2018 khalil et al 2017 lu et al 2015 seyahmazegi et al 2016 sheshmani et al 2014 the peanut is widely harvested in different regions of earth from china to the united states and is a very important product for both small and large commercial producers furthermore it is the 12th most valuable cash crop grown in the united states with a farm value of over one billion u s dollars generally what remains after processing peanut is a hard shell that does not have a valuable price and usually will be used as a cheap fertilizer for farms and greenhouses american peanut council n d archer 2016 in this paper after chemical modification the sorption abilities of the peanut shell ps were studied for adsorption of the nitrate ion also sorption capacity kinetics and thermodynamic factors were obtained it was found that instead of ps which shows no positive result in nitrate adsorption modified peanut shell mps can be an effective anionic sorbent and this offers a fast and economic friendly powder for removing anionic pollution due to the high adsorption capability of this product 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the peanut shell residue was obtained from a regional farm in astaneh guilan iran and was modified for the removal of nitrate ions from aqueous solution in the beginning the ps was dried at 90 c for 60 min in an electric oven memmert un in addition the nitrate ions were formed by solving 1 gr sodium nitrate salt merck mi into 1 l tri distilled water as a stock solution and formerly all of the required concentrations in sorption studies were obtained by dilution 2 2 preparation first the raw solid residue was washed two times with redistilled water to remove the dust and contaminations next the sample was dried in an oven for 6 h at 100 c to remove any humidity and then milled into powder meshing from 200 to 300 μm subsequently 5 g of raw sample were added to 60 ml n n dimethylformamide sigma ald in a 600 ml flask and were treated with 50 ml liquid of 1 chloro 2 3 epoxypropane and a trace amount of pyridine sigma ald as a catalyst finally 50 ml of dimethylamine solution 30 v v merck m added and stirred at 100 c temperature for 5 h wang et al 2007 after filtration and drying the sorbent sample became ready to use 2 3 equipment the batch reactor was a flask inside an electric temperature controlling jacket stirring by a magnetic stirrer stuart uc at 300 rpm in order to determine the concentration of nitrate after finishing every batch experiment a uv spectrophotometer camspec m501 was used at a wavelength of 200 nm furthermore the sorbent

tensor 27 in a range of 400 4000 cm 1 with averaging 16 scans whereas surface morphologies of modified peanut shell were analyzed by sem leo 1430vp 2 4 procedure 2 4 1 adsorption to find the optimum amount of sorbent various amounts of modified sorbent 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 0 1 g were added to 10 ml of a sodium nitrate aqueous solution with an initial concentration of 90 mg lit at a constant temperature the sorption capacity at the equilibrium state was obtained as follows in eq 1 1 q v c 0 c e m where c0 is the initial concentration mg l c e is the equilibrium concentration of aqueous nitrate ion v is the liquid phase volume and m is the mass of unloaded modified sorbent 2 4 2 desorption we predicted that the mps can be recycled after the adsorption process by renewing active molecular sorption sites under alkaline solutions due to the physical nature of this process desorption studies were done by soaking loaded sorbent into 100 ml of 0 1 m koh solution the koh was selected in order to avoid common ion effect with nano3 which could affect the equilibrium state 3 results and discussion 3 1 the sorbent characteristics 3 1 1 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy fig 1 shows the fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy before and after the adsorption of nitrate ions from aqueous solutions the observed peaks above 3000 cm 1 are related to o h and n h vibrations the band at 2900 cm 1 indicates stretching of c h in ch and ch2 the peaks at 1584 and 1599 cm 1 corresponds to n h bending vibrations sowmya and meenakshi 2014 in addition the strong peaks at 1400 and 1550 cm 1 are associated with nitrate stretching vibrations while the first peak is obvious and the second peak might be overlapping by another peak arora et al 2010 it should be noted that the peak at 2135 cm 1 is related with overtones and weak bonds coates 2006 overall it gives the impression that the physisorption has occurred due to remaining of the nitrate stretching vibrations evidence for this is also provided by weak interactions and facile desorption of nitrate ions plus an enthalpy change of lower than 40 kj mol 3 1 2 scanning electron microscopy sem analysis the surface morphology of sorbent determined by sem is shown in fig 2 the sorbent is made up of a porous uneven surface before and after modification this surface of mps can be seen to have high quantities of small pores supposing that this material might possibly grant good characteristics to be employed as a low cost adsorbent for ionic uptake as beforehand reported taşar et al 2014 additionally fig 3 shows that after finishing the sorption process a lesser number of rough pores can be seen and the adsorption has altered the surface morphology 3 2 equilibrium studies 3 2 1 effect of temperature although in the first 5 min the rate of sorption process is almost higher in warmer temperatures fig 4 shows that the final adsorption percentage of nitrate ion drops by increasing temperature according to fig 4 removal percentage decreased from 92 to 71 by varying the temperature value from 10 c to 50 c thus these data show that nitrate adsorption via mps is exothermic and yields higher at lower temperatures 3 2 2 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms are used to clarify the interaction of the adsorbed substance and the sorbent regarding the sorption mechanism moreover the isotherm models are widely used to calculate maximum adsorption capacity which helps to understand how effective a specific sorbent is liu and zhang 2015 taşar et al 2014 several models are often applied to process equilibrium data while langmuir and freundlich isotherms are the most common and useful models among them these isotherms are mathematically simple and provide parameters that have relevant physicochemical meaning for instance the maximum adsorption capacity qm which can be obtained easily from langmuir isotherm is crucial for evaluating of adsorption performance vieira et al 2018 the langmuir model represents the monolayer adsorption onto a surface containing a finite number of tantamount active sites which is expressed as follows in eq 2 2 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e the linear form of the langmuir equation can be rearranged as eq 3 3 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m where qe is adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g ce is the concentration of nitrate in the solution at equilibrium mg l qm is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and kl is the langmuir constant related to the energy of adsorption represents the degree of adsorption affinity to the adsorbate l mg the parameters kl and qm were obtained from the slope and intercept of the plot of ce qe against ce the plot of ce qe versus ce fig 5 should be a straight line with a slope of 1 qm although langmuir isotherm speculates that enthalpy of adsorption is independent of the loading of the sorbate the practical freundlich equation based on sorption onto the heterogeneous surface can be derived presuming a logarithmic decrease in the enthalpy of adsorption with the increase in the fraction of occupied sites katal et al 2012 the freundlich equation is entirely practical based on the sorption onto a heterogeneous surface and is generally given by eq 4 4 q e k f c 1 n where kf and 1 n are the freundlich constants demonstrating the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively eq 4 can be linearized for the determination of the freundlich constants as follow in eq 5 28 29 5 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e in eq 5 the slope and the intercept correspond to 1 n and kf respectively it was revealed that the plot of log qe and log ce gives a straight line fig 6 the results are listed in table 1 3 2 3 thermodynamic parameters according to eq 6 gibbs free energy changes can be calculated at various temperatures 6 δ g rt ln k c the equilibrium constant kc is obtained by making langmuir constant kl dimensionless via multiplying it to 106 the standard enthalpy and entropy variations were determined by plotting ln kc vs 1 t according to van t hoff equation the calculated thermodynamic parameters are shown in table 2 according to table 2 negative values of δg are obtained in all temperatures revealing that the adsorption nature of nitrate onto mps is feasible and spontaneous moreover the negative value of δh changes indicates that the process is exothermic and the products are energetically stable with a high binding of nitrate ions to the adsorbent sites furthermore although the freedom of nitrate ions decreases due to adsorption the positive value of δs suggests an increased degree of freedom we believe that this fact is endorsed by the fact that during adsorption water molecules that are formed hydration shell around nitrate ions will be freed at the sorbate and solution interface with some structural changes in the adsorbate and the adsorbent and an affinity of the adsorbents toward nitrate ions during the adsorption process in the adsorption practice it is necessary to find the process mechanisms physical sorption also well known as physisorption results from comparatively weak interactions such as van der waals force but chemisorption contains more solid chemical bondings with an associated transmission of electrons between the sorbent and sorbate it needs to be regarded that the diversity between physisorption and chemisorption is generally random and the boundaries are not solid thermodynamic parameters of the sorption process including the gibbs energy change δg the enthalpy change δh and the entropy change δs provide a worthy package of information concerning the type and mechanism of the sorption procedure the sorption enthalpy in the example of physisorption is mostly lower than 40 kj mol even though for the example of chemisorption sorption enthalpy is mostly above 40 kj mol worch 2012 3 3 kinetics 3 3 1 the dosage of sorbent studies the amount of sorbent required for the adsorption procedure at each juncture is essential both in the design of the adsorption equipment and its usability on a large scale separation unit in order to obtain a favorable amount different amounts of mps were tested in the presence of a nitrate solution additionally in these series of experiments the contact time was constant 10 min because according to fig 4 over 90 of sorbate was adsorbed during the first 10 min furthermore the concentration of the nitrate solution had been fixed at 90 mg l overall regarding fig 7 the favorable amount of sorbent was selected 0 08 g 3 3 2 kinetic model it is well known that the adsorption process is time dependent thus it is essential to know the rate of adsorption when designing a unit such as a sorption reactor taşar et al 2014 to this end the adsorption data were analyzed with three kinetic models i e pseudo first order pseudo second order and bingham kinetic models 3 3 2 1 pseudo first order kinetic model the pseudo first order expression of lagergren which is widely used for the sorption of a solute from liquid solution is given as jianlong et al 2001 lagergren 1898 7 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t this equation is linear rate expression for pseudo first order reaction where qt mg g is the capacity of the sorbent at time t k1 is the rate constant of pseudo first order adsorption l min k1 and qe as shown in fig 8 were calculated from the slope and intercept of the straight line plots of ln q e q t versus t 3 3 2 2 pseudo second order model the pseudo second order model is based on the assumption that the adsorption process has a chemical base and it is generally given as follows ahmad et al 2009 8 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where qe is the amount of nitrate adsorbed at equilibrium state k2 is the sorption rate constant of pseudo second order adsorption qt is the time based sorption capacity and t is the time the straight line plots of t qt versus t at different temperatures fig 9 indicate the applicability of the above equation to nitrate adsorption onto mps 3 3 2 3 bingham kinetic model the bingham model is defined as the simplification of the weber and morris model or the application of the freundlich model in kinetic modeling largitte and pasquier 2016 the linear form of this model is given in eq 9 9 ln q t 1 m ln t ln k b where kb and 1 m are bingham constants and are obtained from plotting ln qt versus ln t fig 10 the values of the kinetic parameters of adsorption are summarized in table 3 3 4 reusability studies for indicating the reusability of the sorbent the adsorption desorption progression was repeated six times for mps adsorption and desorption experiments were executed at room temperature to simulate an effective condition in the industry the adsorption and desorption capacities were approximately the same even after six runs fig 11 3 5 comparison with other sorbents a comparison of the performance of mps with former adsorbents for nitrate removal from an aqueous solution is showing in table 4 according to table 4 the mps is suitable for nitrate removal because it presented adsorption capacity higher than those of reported sorbents and is faster for removing nitrate from an aqueous solution regarding most of the sorbents 4 conclusions in summary we found that the mps powder can be a potential low cost sorbent for the removal of nitrate contaminants from water the results taken from this study were well described by the langmuir isotherm with a very high correlation ratio the values of qm and kl were decreased with increasing the temperature therefor the results also indicated the exothermic nature of the adsorption thus the process yields higher at low temperatures adsorption process like every other reaction process is time based meanwhile the kinetic data designates that the adsorption process was well ordered by the pseudo second order model the thermodynamic properties were calculated from the langmuir isotherm constant at different temperatures the negative δgads values show the adsorption is thermodynamically feasible and spontaneous the positive value of δsads discloses the amplified freeness of water molecules at the solid solution interface during the breaking of the hydration shell the change of enthalpy established that the sorption of nitrate by mps was exothermic and also due to a physical force we also carried out a recycling study on the mps and we found that the sorbent can be recycled and reused several times by soaking into an alkaline solution acknowledgments authors express their gratitude to the university grants commission ugc

adsorption onto mps 3 3 2 3 bingham kinetic model the bingham model is defined as the simplification of the weber and morris model or the application of the freundlich model in kinetic modeling largitte and pasquier 2016 the linear form of this model is given in eq 9 9 ln q t 1 m ln t ln k b where kb and 1 m are bingham constants and are obtained from plotting ln qt versus ln t fig 10 the values of the kinetic parameters of adsorption are summarized in table 3 3 4 reusability studies for indicating the reusability of the sorbent the adsorption desorption progression was repeated six times for mps adsorption and desorption experiments were executed at room temperature to simulate an effective condition in the industry the adsorption and desorption capacities were approximately the same even after six runs fig 11 3 5 comparison with other sorbents a comparison of the performance of mps with former adsorbents for nitrate removal from an aqueous solution is showing in table 4 according to table 4 the mps is suitable for nitrate removal because it presented adsorption capacity higher than those of reported sorbents and is faster for removing nitrate from an aqueous solution regarding most of the sorbents 4 conclusions in summary we found that the mps powder can be a potential low cost sorbent for the removal of nitrate contaminants from water the results taken from this study were well described by the langmuir isotherm with a very high correlation ratio the values of qm and kl were decreased with increasing the temperature therefor the results also indicated the exothermic nature of the adsorption thus the process yields higher at low temperatures adsorption process like every other reaction process is time based meanwhile the kinetic data designates that the adsorption process was well ordered by the pseudo second order model the thermodynamic properties were calculated from the langmuir isotherm constant at different temperatures the negative δgads values show the adsorption is thermodynamically feasible and spontaneous the positive value of δsads discloses the amplified freeness of water molecules at the solid solution interface during the breaking of the hydration shell the change of enthalpy established that the sorption of nitrate by mps was exothermic and also due to a physical force we also carried out a recycling study on the mps and we found that the sorbent can be recycled and reused several times by soaking into an alkaline solution acknowledgments authors express their gratitude to the university grants commission ugc

12061,low pressure reverse osmosis lpro plants have been installed in the north central province of sri lanka as a measure to supply good quality water to people who are affected with chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology ckdu the concentrate of these membrane based samples have been released to the soil without any treatment in this study the quality of discharging concentrate and effects of the discharge on soil were investigated statistical analysis techniques were employed in determining the effects among the analysed ph ec na hardness toc f and no3 n of feed and concentrate streams ec and hardness showed statistically significant changes in soil analysis in plants at which the concentrate have been discharged for a longer durations significant changes were found in ph and k content of soil the affected soils shows higher ph and lower k levels compared to unaffected soils indicating exchange of h and k ions present in soil with ca2 and mg2 present in concentrate this finding suggests that monitoring of receiving soils at lpro plants in future is required graphical abstract image 1 keywords concentrate chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology low pressure reverse osmosis soil 1 introduction membrane based technologies are heavily used in desalination of seawater and brackish water in treating industrial wastewater for reuse of wastewater and to treat groundwater with different salinities usbr 2006 shenvi et al 2015 in addition membrane based technologies would be used in treating drinking water where a centralized water treatment plant with a pipe distribution network is not economical for example in remote areas with less population density it would be useful for supplying good quality drinking water for direct consumption since membrane based technologies are known for high purification efficiencies shenvi et al 2015 this would be useful especially when there are distinctive drinking water quality concerns during past two to three decades chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology ckdu has been found in arid regions of sri lanka the main drinking water sources are groundwater wells and population density of these areas are low among many hypothesis quality and quantity of drinking water has been recognized as the possible main factor behind the disease jayasumana et al 2016 dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 therefore water authorities of the country have introduced small scale membrane based treatment plants to supply water to the people of the affected areas these plants are commonly known as reverse osmosis ro plants within the country however the working pressure of the membranes suggests the term low pressure reverse osmosis lpro plants would better represent the scenario since the inception of abovementioned lpro plants concentrate has been discharged to the open environment mainly to the land direct land application of concentrate can be a potential threat to the receiving environment squire 2000 usbr 2006 jahnke et al 2019 however the quality of concentrate is directly linked to the quality of source water rejection rate of the membranes squire 2000 and inflow to the membrane the source water of majority of the abovementioned ckdu affected areas could be categorized as class g i based on total dissolved solids tds concentration tds less than 3000 mg l dehan 1990 as medium conductivity class 1 500 1000 μs cm or medium conductivity class 2 1000 3000 μs cm based on electrical conductivity sarma and narayanaswamy 1981 hardness of the water can be classified as hard 150 300 mg l as caco3 or very hard over 300 mg l as caco3 khan et al 2015 high hardness is one of the main water quality issues in the ckdu affected areas investigations on the quality of concentrate of sri lankan lpro plants are very limited athapattu et al 2017 has reported a study on treating the concentrate of a membrane based plant located in ckdu affected areas in that study the effect of a constructed wetland on the quality of concentrate coming out of one plant has studied the quality of concentrate reported in that study is not comprehensive enough to reach a solid conclusion on the quality of concentrate which would expect in the treatment plants in the region to best of our knowledge the effect of direct land application of the concentrate from lpro plants treating groundwater has not been reported however such investigations are of high importance since the community and water authorities are concerned about the possible consequences of discharging concentrate in addition analysis of the quality of concentrate and discharging environment would provide insight for selecting appropriate treatment options if required panagopoulos et al 2019 therefore this research mainly focuses on investigating the quality of concentrate generated at membrane based treatment plants in ckdu affected areas moreover the possible impacts of direct land application of concentrate are investigated based on soil sample analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials reagent grade kcl edta acetic acid and ammonium hydroxide were purchased from meron cochin reagents for measuring no3 and f were purchased from hach all standard solutions for analysis were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 methods 2 2 1 selection of membrane based treatment plants the selection of 8 plants was done based on factors such as the number of years in operation plant capacity source of feed water and ckdu patient density out of these 8 plants 4 plants periyakulama nagadaranawa pahalakudapattiya and thurukkuragama were selected for soil analysis considering the plant capacity year of inception and the practical aspects of obtaining samples locations of the plants and the details of the plants are illustrated in fig 1 and table 1 respectively 2 2 2 analysis of the quality of feed water and concentrate feed water and concentrate samples were collected on four occasions 25 03 2017 04 07 2017 30 07 2017 03 09 2017 representing the dry period of the year expecting more feed challenging water quality as well as quantity dr 2010 hach spectrophotometer was used to analyze no3 and f and total carbon analyzer shemadzu toc l csh 638 91111 48 was used to analyze the total organic carbon toc content ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured using appropriate probes atomic adsorption spectrophotometer aas shimadzu aa 7000 and edta titrimetric method apha 2012 were used to analyze the na content and total hardness respectively 2 2 3 analysis of the quality of soil samples soil samples were collected from four different plants plants were selected considering duration of operation plant capacity ease of access for soil sampling and water source in each plant four locations were selected first three locations were selected along the concentrate disposal channel first location is the discharge point second and third locations are 1 m and 2 m downstream of the discharging point respectively fourth location was selected from the visually unaffected zone within the plant from each location samples were collected from the surface level 0 5 m below ground and 1 m below ground incorporating suitable ion selective electrodes ec and ph of soil was measured using a suspension of soil in water medium 1 2 5 soil to water ratio employing aas shimadzu aa 7000 soil k content exchangeable was investigated using ammonia acetate extraction method rees et al 2013 in order to determine the no3 n content in soil kcl extraction was employed and analysed using dr 2010 hach spectrophotometer 2 2 4 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were carried out using microsoft excel 2010 software two tailed heteroscedastic t test was carried out considering a significance level α of 0 05 anova was carried out considering two factor without replication case and with a significance level α 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 quality of feed water and concentrate data presented in table 2 show the quality of feed and concentrate of the lpro plants ph values of feeds and concentrates vary between 6 59 7 35 and 6 69 7 35 respectively these ranges are within the drinking water standards of the country which is 6 5 8 5 sri lanka standards for potable water sls 614 2013 ph of feed and concentrate do not show a statistically significant difference p 0 92 electrical conductivity ec of feeds and concentrates are ranged between 0 7 and 1 6 ms cm and 1 29 2 33 ms cm respectively the feeds therefore can be classified as medium conductivity class 1 or class 2 water while concentrate is medium conductivity class 2 water sarma and narayanaswamy 1981 considering a tds ec ratio of 0 55 0 7 estimated range of tds of feed water would be between 385 and 1120 ppm jayasumana et al 2016 has reported tds levels between 227 6 and 906 7 ppm in feed of similar plants which are situated in anuradhapura district this tds range suggests that the feed water does not satisfy the drinking water standard of sri lanka which is defined as tds of 500 ppm statistical analysis suggests a significant difference between the ec of feeds and concentrates p 0 003 this is due to the rejection of salts by the membrane however ec of concentrate does not reach high conductivity class i e 3000 μs cm suggesting possible lower effects on the receiving environment recoveries of the investigated plants were found as low as 30 55 detailed data are not shown here for these low recoveries concentration factor of ionic species is in the range of 1 42 2 22 squire 2000 table 2 reveals that the na concentrations in feeds and concentrates are not changed considerably p 0 37 this can be due to the low efficiency of membranes in removing na ions from water and low concentration factors due to low recoveries moreover the plants which were investigated under this study showed feed na concentrations towards the minimum reported values in the dry zone of sri lanka dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 due to low na content in concentrates sodium percentage and sodium adsorption ratio of discharging concentrates would be low kumari et al 2016 reducing the sodium hazard of discharging water hardness of groundwater has been proposed as a possible factor behind ckdu dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 table 2 shows that the hardness of concentrate is higher compared to that of feed water and the difference is statistically significant p 0 002 hardness of feed and concentrate suggest that both streams are very hard water khan et al 2015 analysis of feed water hardness detailed data are not shown here revealed a rejection of 65 85 of hardness however due to low recovery of the plants hardness of concentrates rarely increased by a factor of 2 with respect to that of feed streams data presented in table 2 show that in most of the plants toc concentration of feed is higher than 2 mg l according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa if the toc concentration is higher than 2 mg l there is a possibility of generating disinfectant by products usepa 2012 toc concentrations of concentrates and feeds did not show a statistically significant difference p 0 79 the toc concentrations of concentrates are varied between non detectable to 8 34 mg l while toc concentrations of sri lankan groundwaters have not been researched adequately the toc values reported here are smaller lyon et al 2011 or comparable bradford et al 1994 to similar studies therefore the land disposal of concentrate streams with toc values reported here would not significantly harm the receiving environment contamination of groundwater with high amount of f has been suggested as a causative factor behind ckdu dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 concentrations of f in feeds and concentrates are shown in table 2 the two data sets do not show a statistically significant difference p 0 22 membrane efficiency in terms of removal of f is in the range of 15 77 with only three cases above 70 detailed data are not shown here low removal efficiencies and low recoveries can be the reasons behind marginal differences between the f concentrations however as a result discharge of concentrate to open land area would not significantly alter the natural f content of receiving environments concentrations of no3 as no3 n in feed and concentrate streams of investigated plants are shown in table 2 it can be seen that the no3 content has increased in concentrates compared that of feeds however this increment is not statistically significant p 0 65 moreover both feed water and concentrate contain no3 below permissible levels for drinking water 50 mg l as no3 sri lanka standards for potable water sls 614 2013 these facts suggest that the open discharge of concentrate would not significantly alter the no3 content of receiving environments 3 2 effect of direct land application of concentrate on soil tables 3 6 show the results of soil analysis and location numbers 1 3 denotes three locations along the unlined discharge ditches location 4 is unaffected by the discharge data shown in table 3 reveal the variation of ec at receiving soil of selected plants ec of all locations and depths are 50 350 μs cm average 149 02 μs cm standard deviation 75 34 μs cm the ec values are very low indicating low level of salinity these low ec values may be due to the dominating effect of low soil mineral content compared to the effect of weather usually the soil ec of dry areas are expected to be high due to the low flushing of minerals from soil at low annual rainfalls usda 2011a sanjeevani et al 2013 has reported that in the dry zone of sri lanka soil ec in suspention 1 5 soil to water ratio and in saturated paste as 30 μs cm and 300 μs cm respectively these values are comparable with the values found in current study at periyakulama plant statistical analysis anova shows a significant variation of ec in vertical profiles p 0 0015 f 23 3189 fcrit 5 1433 considerably high f values compared to critical f suggest a considerable depth wise variation in all four locations however considering the differences at four locations including the unaffected area statistically significant variation is not seen p 0 6294 f 0 6160 fcrit 4 7571 therefore it can be said that the depth wise variation may not be due to the discharge of concentrate similar finding can be reported for thurukkuragama treatment plant as well ec of nagadaranawa and pahalakudapattiya plants do not show statistically significant variations based on the location or vertical distribution therefore it can be said that at the treatment plants investigated ec of soil is not significantly affected due to the discharge of concentrate streams ph values shown in table 4 varied between 6 07 and 8 29 average 7 15 standard deviation 0 39 majority of crops give their highest yield within ph range of 6 7 5 usda 2011b and therefore the soil in the receiving grounds do not show adverse effects on crop yield statistical analysis anova shows statistically significant variation of ph values in periyakulama p 0 0244 f 6 6740 fcrit 4 7571 and pahalakudapattiya p 0 0325 f 5 8486 fcrit 4 7571 table 4 also suggests that at these two plants ph values at the unaffected area are more acidic compared to the locations along the concentrate discharge channel in addition at pahalakudapattiya plant vertical profile of ph also changes considerably p 0 0075 f 12 3360 fcrit 5 1433 table 4 clearly shows more acidic soil at deeper locations compared to the surface however in no case ph value goes below 6 00 based on abovementioned observations following speculation can be reached for periyakulama and pahalakudapattiya plants low ph of unaffected locations and deep soil layers shows high amount of h on soil grains as evident in table 2 concentrate which is released at these plants carry high amount of salts of ca2 and mg2 those ions can exchange with available h ions on soil grains increasing the ph however soil at thurukkuragama and nagadaranawa plants do not show significant changes in ph this can be due to few reasons as can be seen in table 1 periyakulama plant has been releasing concentrate since 2013 therefore the effect which is shown in table 4 is due to discharging concentrate for about 5 years pahalakudapattiya plant has been releasing concentrate for about 3 years and more importantly the plant capacity is high compared to other plants high capacity and long operational duration increase the mass of ions released to the environment therefore the effect due to discharging concentrate on soil is visible at these two plants in contrast thurukkuragama plant initiated operation in 2017 and the plant production is as low as 2000 l day nagadaranawa plant has been in operation since 2015 however the production is limited to 8000 l day significant change in soil ph is not visible due to the combined effect of low operating duration and capacity in addition it is worthwhile noting that an ever increasing soil ph also not expected with time in order to analyze the final effects a careful investigation on soil cation exchange capacity would be required at saturation of cation exchange there is a risk of contaminating soil pore water therefore if the concentrate is to be released without any treatment careful monitoring of receiving soil and groundwater is suggested as shown in table 5 the soil k values vary between 0 02 mg g to 0 29 mg g with an average and standard deviation of 0 1434 mg g and 0 077 mg g respectively it is reported that the k exchangeable content of sri lankan paddy soils as trace level 0 273 mg g kemmler 1980 which is in good agreement with the findings of this study significant difference between k contents at different locations of the plant has been observed at periyakulama p 0 0048 f 13 0944 fcrit 4 7571 and thurukkuragama p 0 0382 f 5 4241 fcrit 4 7571 plants table 5 shows that the k content of soils at the unaffected area is high compared to the other three locations at periyakulama plant this can be due to the exchange of k ions in soil with ca2 and mg2 ions present in concentrate it should be noted that in periyakulama plant concentrate has been discharged since 2013 however although there is a statistically significant difference at thurukkuragama plant table 5 suggests that this observation can be due to the high k content at deep soil 1 m below the surface of location 1 this outlier may have influenced the statistical calculations after removing the outlier the standard deviation of data is 0 036 mg g compared to the standard deviation of 0 058 mg g considering all data data presented in table 6 show the variation of no3 content in soil at four plants based on anova only in periyakulama the vertical distribution shows a statistically significant difference in no3 content however even in periyakulama plant no significant variation is recognized at four locations i e three locations along the discharge canal and one unaffected location this finding suggests that the vertical profile variations may be due to the properties of soil and not due to the discharge of concentrate to the land the discussion here suggests that at majority of the plants which were studied no significant variation of soil properties is identified however possible future effects due to long term discharge of concentrate is evident since the plant which has been discharging concentrate for about 5 years shows significant effects on soil therefore it is recommended to carryout a comprehensive monitoring programme at plants to observe any effects on soil due to the discharge of concentrate meanwhile investigating for appropriate treatment technologies to treat discharging concentrates would be important for future applications 4 conclusions this research focused on analysing the quality of concentrate which is generated at the lpro plants in ckdu affected areas and on investigating the impacts of direct discharge of concentrate on receiving soil ph ec na hardness toc f and no3 n of feed and concentrate streams were analysed at eight 8 lpro plants statistical analysis reveals that ec and hardness of two streams are significantly different while the other measured parameters do not show such variations in two streams however the ec of concentrate is still in the medium conductivity class 2 range suggesting possible low risk to the receiving environment hardness of the concentrate is higher than that of the feed stream and hardness of both streams can be classified as high in majority of the cases increment in hardness is lesser than a factor of 2 statistically insignificant difference observed in other parameters can be due to the low rejection and low recovery of lpro plants soil samples collected from 4 plants out of 8 which were analysed for concentrate quality were investigated in order to study the possible changes in receiving soils due to the direct discharge of concentrate at lpro plants ec ph k and no3 of affected and unaffected soils were analysed a statistically significant variation of ec and no3 due to discharge of concentrate is not identified in any plant however at plants with high production capacity and long operational duration soil shows high ph values at affected areas compared to unaffected areas and a reduction in soil k content possibly due to the ion exchange based on soil analysis it is clear that there is a posibility of changing the soil chemistry with time therefore it is advisable to propose a monitoring programme to periodically analyze soil to see any changes acknowledgements authors acknowledge the support extended by the national water supply and drainage board nws db of sri lanka

the quality of feed and concentrate of the lpro plants ph values of feeds and concentrates vary between 6 59 7 35 and 6 69 7 35 respectively these ranges are within the drinking water standards of the country which is 6 5 8 5 sri lanka standards for potable water sls 614 2013 ph of feed and concentrate do not show a statistically significant difference p 0 92 electrical conductivity ec of feeds and concentrates are ranged between 0 7 and 1 6 ms cm and 1 29 2 33 ms cm respectively the feeds therefore can be classified as medium conductivity class 1 or class 2 water while concentrate is medium conductivity class 2 water sarma and narayanaswamy 1981 considering a tds ec ratio of 0 55 0 7 estimated range of tds of feed water would be between 385 and 1120 ppm jayasumana et al 2016 has reported tds levels between 227 6 and 906 7 ppm in feed of similar plants which are situated in anuradhapura district this tds range suggests that the feed water does not satisfy the drinking water standard of sri lanka which is defined as tds of 500 ppm statistical analysis suggests a significant difference between the ec of feeds and concentrates p 0 003 this is due to the rejection of salts by the membrane however ec of concentrate does not reach high conductivity class i e 3000 μs cm suggesting possible lower effects on the receiving environment recoveries of the investigated plants were found as low as 30 55 detailed data are not shown here for these low recoveries concentration factor of ionic species is in the range of 1 42 2 22 squire 2000 table 2 reveals that the na concentrations in feeds and concentrates are not changed considerably p 0 37 this can be due to the low efficiency of membranes in removing na ions from water and low concentration factors due to low recoveries moreover the plants which were investigated under this study showed feed na concentrations towards the minimum reported values in the dry zone of sri lanka dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 due to low na content in concentrates sodium percentage and sodium adsorption ratio of discharging concentrates would be low kumari et al 2016 reducing the sodium hazard of discharging water hardness of groundwater has been proposed as a possible factor behind ckdu dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 table 2 shows that the hardness of concentrate is higher compared to that of feed water and the difference is statistically significant p 0 002 hardness of feed and concentrate suggest that both streams are very hard water khan et al 2015 analysis of feed water hardness detailed data are not shown here revealed a rejection of 65 85 of hardness however due to low recovery of the plants hardness of concentrates rarely increased by a factor of 2 with respect to that of feed streams data presented in table 2 show that in most of the plants toc concentration of feed is higher than 2 mg l according to the united states environmental protection agency usepa if the toc concentration is higher than 2 mg l there is a possibility of generating disinfectant by products usepa 2012 toc concentrations of concentrates and feeds did not show a statistically significant difference p 0 79 the toc concentrations of concentrates are varied between non detectable to 8 34 mg l while toc concentrations of sri lankan groundwaters have not been researched adequately the toc values reported here are smaller lyon et al 2011 or comparable bradford et al 1994 to similar studies therefore the land disposal of concentrate streams with toc values reported here would not significantly harm the receiving environment contamination of groundwater with high amount of f has been suggested as a causative factor behind ckdu dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 concentrations of f in feeds and concentrates are shown in table 2 the two data sets do not show a statistically significant difference p 0 22 membrane efficiency in terms of removal of f is in the range of 15 77 with only three cases above 70 detailed data are not shown here low removal efficiencies and low recoveries can be the reasons behind marginal differences between the f concentrations however as a result discharge of concentrate to open land area would not significantly alter the natural f content of receiving environments concentrations of no3 as no3 n in feed and concentrate streams of investigated plants are shown in table 2 it can be seen that the no3 content has increased in concentrates compared that of feeds however this increment is not statistically significant p 0 65 moreover both feed water and concentrate contain no3 below permissible levels for drinking water 50 mg l as no3 sri lanka standards for potable water sls 614 2013 these facts suggest that the open discharge of concentrate would not significantly alter the no3 content of receiving environments 3 2 effect of direct land application of concentrate on soil tables 3 6 show the results of soil analysis and location numbers 1 3 denotes three locations along the unlined discharge ditches location 4 is unaffected by the discharge data shown in table 3 reveal the variation of ec at receiving soil of selected plants ec of all locations and depths are 50 350 μs cm average 149 02 μs cm standard deviation 75 34 μs cm the ec values are very low indicating low level of salinity these low ec values may be due to the dominating effect of low soil mineral content compared to the effect of weather usually the soil ec of dry areas are expected to be high due to the low flushing of minerals from soil at low annual rainfalls usda 2011a sanjeevani et al 2013 has reported that in the dry zone of sri lanka soil ec in suspention 1 5 soil to water ratio and in saturated paste as 30 μs cm and 300 μs cm respectively these values are comparable with the values found in current study at periyakulama plant statistical analysis anova shows a significant variation of ec in vertical profiles p 0 0015 f 23 3189 fcrit 5 1433 considerably high f values compared to critical f suggest a considerable depth wise variation in all four locations however considering the differences at four locations including the unaffected area statistically significant variation is not seen p 0 6294 f 0 6160 fcrit 4 7571 therefore it can be said that the depth wise variation may not be due to the discharge of concentrate similar finding can be reported for thurukkuragama treatment plant as well ec of nagadaranawa and pahalakudapattiya plants do not show statistically significant variations based on the location or vertical distribution therefore it can be said that at the treatment plants investigated ec of soil is not significantly affected due to the discharge of concentrate streams ph values shown in table 4 varied between 6 07 and 8 29 average 7 15 standard deviation 0 39 majority of crops give their highest yield within ph range of 6 7 5 usda 2011b and therefore the soil in the receiving grounds do not show adverse effects on crop yield statistical analysis anova shows statistically significant variation of ph values in periyakulama p 0 0244 f 6 6740 fcrit 4 7571 and pahalakudapattiya p 0 0325 f 5 8486 fcrit 4 7571 table 4 also suggests that at these two plants ph values at the unaffected area are more acidic compared to the locations along the concentrate discharge channel in addition at pahalakudapattiya plant vertical profile of ph also changes considerably p 0 0075 f 12 3360 fcrit 5 1433 table 4 clearly shows more acidic soil at deeper locations compared to the surface however in no case ph value goes below 6 00 based on abovementioned observations following speculation can be reached for periyakulama and pahalakudapattiya plants low ph of unaffected locations and deep soil layers shows high amount of h on soil grains as evident in table 2 concentrate which is released at these plants carry high amount of salts of ca2 and mg2 those ions can exchange with available h ions on soil grains increasing the ph however soil at thurukkuragama and nagadaranawa plants do not show significant changes in ph this can be due to few reasons as can be seen in table 1 periyakulama plant has been releasing concentrate since 2013 therefore the effect which is shown in table 4 is due to discharging concentrate for about 5 years pahalakudapattiya plant has been releasing concentrate for about 3 years and more importantly the plant capacity is high compared to other plants high capacity and long operational duration increase the mass of ions released to the environment therefore the effect due to discharging concentrate on soil is visible at these two plants in contrast thurukkuragama plant initiated operation in 2017 and the plant production is as low as 2000 l day nagadaranawa plant has been in operation since 2015 however the production is limited to 8000 l day significant change in soil ph is not visible due to the combined effect of low operating duration and capacity in addition it is worthwhile noting that an ever increasing soil ph also not expected with time in order to analyze the final effects a careful investigation on soil cation exchange capacity would be required at saturation of cation exchange there is a risk of contaminating soil pore water therefore if the concentrate is to be released without any treatment careful monitoring of receiving soil and groundwater is suggested as shown in table 5 the soil k values vary between 0 02 mg g to 0 29 mg g with an average and standard deviation of 0 1434 mg g and 0 077 mg g respectively it is reported that the k exchangeable content of sri lankan paddy soils as trace level 0 273 mg g kemmler 1980 which is in good agreement with the findings of this study significant difference between k contents at different locations of the plant has been observed at periyakulama p 0 0048 f 13 0944 fcrit 4 7571 and thurukkuragama p 0 0382 f 5 4241 fcrit 4 7571 plants table 5 shows that the k content of soils at the unaffected area is high compared to the other three locations at periyakulama plant this can be due to the exchange of k ions in soil with ca2 and mg2 ions present in concentrate it should be noted that in periyakulama plant concentrate has been discharged since 2013 however although there is a statistically significant difference at thurukkuragama plant table 5 suggests that this observation can be due to the high k content at deep soil 1 m below the surface of location 1 this outlier may have influenced the statistical calculations after removing the outlier the standard deviation of data is 0 036 mg g compared to the standard deviation of 0 058 mg g considering all data data presented in table 6 show the variation of no3 content in soil at four plants based on anova only in periyakulama the vertical distribution shows a statistically significant difference in no3 content however even in periyakulama plant no significant variation is recognized at four locations i e three locations along the discharge canal and one unaffected location this finding suggests that the vertical profile variations may be due to the properties of soil and not due to the discharge of concentrate to the land the discussion here suggests that at majority of the plants which were studied no significant variation of soil properties is identified however possible future effects due to long term discharge of concentrate is evident since the plant which has been discharging concentrate for about 5 years shows significant effects on soil therefore it is recommended to carryout a comprehensive monitoring programme at plants to observe any effects on soil due to the discharge of concentrate meanwhile investigating for appropriate treatment technologies to treat discharging concentrates would be important for future applications 4 conclusions this research focused on analysing the quality of concentrate which is generated at the lpro plants in ckdu affected areas and on investigating the impacts of direct discharge of concentrate on receiving soil ph ec na hardness toc f and no3 n of feed and concentrate streams were analysed at eight 8 lpro plants statistical analysis reveals that ec and hardness of two streams are significantly different while the other measured parameters do not show such variations in two streams however the ec of concentrate is still in the medium conductivity class 2 range suggesting possible low risk to the receiving environment hardness of the concentrate is higher than that of the feed stream and hardness of both streams can be classified as high in majority of the cases increment in hardness is lesser than a factor of 2 statistically insignificant difference observed in other parameters can be due to the low rejection and low recovery of lpro plants soil samples collected from 4 plants out of 8 which were analysed for concentrate quality were investigated in order to study the possible changes in receiving soils due to the direct discharge of concentrate at lpro plants ec ph k and no3 of affected and unaffected soils were analysed a statistically significant variation of ec and no3 due to discharge of concentrate is not identified in any plant however at plants with high production capacity and long operational duration soil shows high ph values at affected areas compared to unaffected areas and a reduction in soil k content possibly due to the ion exchange based on soil analysis it is clear that there is a posibility of changing the soil chemistry with time therefore it is advisable to propose a monitoring programme to periodically analyze soil to see any changes acknowledgements authors acknowledge the support extended by the national water supply and drainage board nws db of sri lanka

12062,the yamuna river is the part of vast indo gangetic alluvial plain abides a huge scarcity of water in terms of both surface and groundwater resources artificial recharge is the most promising measure in the present scenario to improve the groundwater conditions of the area in the present study artificial recharge sites were delineated using the important factors which plays a pivotal role in groundwater occurrence through analytical hierarchy process ahp based modelling in geographical information system gis environment datasets from different sources and landsat 8 satellite images were used to assign the weightage for different parameters in accordance to their role in site selection for artificial recharging the study shows that the sub watershed 1 lies in the south western upland of agra district and sub watershed 2 which is located in firozabad district occupies an area of 304 km2 42 and 248 km2 35 respectively found under critical groundwater condition in terms of declining groundwater level these sites are located mainly around the settlement areas of relatively higher elevation overall 26 area i e very low water level class in the study area in the presented study exhibit poor groundwater conditions i e 32 42 m bgl and hence required an immediate treatment in terms of artificial technology in order to enrich the water stressed alluvial aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords artificial groundwater recharge zone suitable sites analytical hierarchy process ahp geospatial technology 1 introduction most of world s civilizations takes place around the major river banks since the beginning of our evolution this demonstrates our dependency on these water resources and their associated enriched watersheds recently it has been estimated that around 85 rural 50 urban household and 60 irrigation water demands are met by groundwater in the country kumar and krishna 2018 jasrotia et al 2019 haque et al 2020 adimalla and taloor 2020 taloor et al 2020 but the declining water level of river floodplains is the major concern for hydrologists and environmentalists several new approaches for addressing the worldwide depleting groundwater resources in order to enrich the future trajectory of river health in floodplain areas are the outcome of this graver situation bhat et al 2019 kaur et al 2020 among all these newly grown approaches including multiple criteria decision analysis mcda boolean logic analytical network process anp artificial aquifer recharge using analytical hierarchy process ahp appears to be widely acceptable technique and successfully implemented in several countries like us japan europe middle east africa and india agarwal et al 2013 sener and davraz 2013 shekhar and pandey 2015 jasrotia et al 2016 singh et al 2017 pinto et al 2017 lee et al 2018 muniraj et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 the opted approach of groundwater recharge is variable in nature and depends on the complications integrated with the sustainable development of watersheds agrawal and garg 2016 in order to manage these over exploited alluvial rivers through artificial groundwater recharge required comprehensive knowledge of drainage pattern geology geomorphology and their associated geographical features to reach a reasonable conclusion hao et al 2014 selvarani et al 2017 kothyari et al 2019 taloor et al 2019 these hydrological attributes seems to be strongly related to the interaction of shallow groundwater associated with floodplains in alluvial river to the water in the main channel hancock et al 2005 krause et al 2007 the stream bed characteristics and nature of alluvium determines this inter dependability of groundwater and surface water to a great extent winter 1998 however channel position its plan form features geometry and size also plays a dominant role during the entire process of enriching or depleting the ground water occurrence the present study attempts to provide holistic view of groundwater depletion in the study area along with the delineation of crucial sites which required immediate management several studies have been carried out in and around the study area to highlight the scarcity of surface water in main channel jha et al 1993 singh 2001 misra 2010 soni et al 2013 khan et al 2018 2020 bib khan et al 2018 bib khan et al 2020 however the study area is very less explored in terms of groundwater related studies groundwater recharging is an ancient practice and has been started in chorus with evolution of man over exploitation of these resources reducing the present groundwater levels and also poses a threat for long term aquifer s life groundwater recharge using ponds canals and reservoirs were the conventional methods of groundwater recharging seems to be time consuming and expensive kaliraj et al 2014 the availability of high resolution remote sensing data and use of gis stimulated the groundwater management studies by providing more synoptic and scientific understanding of the terrain elbeih 2015 patra et al 2017 patil et al 2018 adimalla et al 2020 remote sensing technology coupled with gis preferred greatly due to easiness in preparation of huge

selection for artificial recharge is the most scientific initiative in order to replenish the groundwater resources more appropriately artificial recharge technique by analysing all the contributing factors including geology geomorphology drainage characteristics slope and land use evidenced to be most promising akinlalu et al 2017 in this regard several geospatial techniques are in frequent use to address the water management practices all over the globe analytical hierarchy process proved to be distinguish among them due to its capability to quantify the subjective judgement of the evaluator as the weights of the criteria is one of the pre requisite factor gdoura et al 2015 arulbalaji et al 2019 the assessment of geometric mean and normalized weight through pair wise comparison matrix for distinguish datasets makes it more comprehensive to deal with groundwater related problems fournier et al 2016 shabbir and ahmad 2016 however the present study is carried out in low lands of an alluvial yamuna river running in vast indo gangetic plain with the objective to enhance the groundwater resources for the sustainable development of entire catchment area of yamuna river concomitantly the study also expounds and emphasizes the role of analytical hierarchy process ahp and geospatial techniques for identification of artificial groundwater recharging sites 2 study area the sub watershed of yamuna river around agra firozabad and etawah district in the western uttar pradesh characterize the area under investigation which is bounded by longitude 78 0 to 79 15 e and latitude 26 30 to 27 15 n fig 1 the present study concentrated on the landscape in and around the main channel of the yamuna river and occupied an area of about 2975 km2 study area is further divided into three sub watersheds named as sw 1 sw 2 and sw 3 occupies an area of 924 km2 716 km2 and 1331 km2 respectively the 150 km long stretch of main channel along with its tributaries falls in toposheets no 54i 3 54i 4 54i 7 and 54 i 8 of survey of india is selected for the present study degradational topography due to dominance of erosional features and highly dissected nature of region further characterize the study area rao et al 2017 ali et al 2019 the yamuna river floodplain in the study area is one of the most polluted and densely populated floodplain and facing the scarcity of water simultaneously gopal and sah 1993 misra 2010 khan et al 2020 the primary source of water in the yamuna river is the south west monsoon and the area under investigation gets minimum flow during pre monsoon season as the natural flow is hindered by several man made obstructions jha et al 1993 the groundwater levels ranges from 6 m bgl to 37 m bgl in pre monsoon period and 4 42 m bgl in post monsoon season in the present study physical appearance of the channel and the amount of run off discharge also suggests that the river becomes effluent in this portion of its journey soni et al 2013 the effluent character of yamuna river in parts of agra firozabad and etawah districts is the consequence of several anthropogenic processes operated over it including waste water inflow and construction of several man made structures which hindered the natural flow of main channel the river emerges in the study area after passing through several barrage and mega cities beyond okhla barrage the fresh surface water in the yamuna river becomes almost extinct the domestic and industrial wastewater produces as a consequence of high population load of national capital region ncr recharging the afterwards portions of the river through shahadra outlet misra 2010 the study area is also cited as the most hydrologically stressed area by several authors sharma and kansal 2006 misra 2010 rai et al 2011 soni et al 2014 the agra district south western extremity of the present study area witnessed a declination of water level from 0 5 to 1 m per year due to the fast urban expansion upadhayay 2017 in this region the dominant occupation is agriculture which further accelerates the demand of fresh water in the region 3 datasets and methodology presented study is carried out using different datasets and tools to process the data which is presented below firstly the entire yamuna river catchment in the study was divided into different sub watersheds using arc hydro tool in arcgis environment it requires srtm dem as input to delineate sub watershed through flow direction flow accumulation stream definition and stream segmentation analysis the delineated sub watershed using srtm dem are the basis for further analysis drainage density and slope attributes of the study area were prepared using the survey of india soi toposheets and srtm dem data respectively the srtm dem data of 30 m resolution is resampled in to 10 m resolution using nearest neighbour resampling approach in arc gis the drainage density layer laid over on digital elevation model dem of the study area to represent the flow condition of surface and groundwater resources meteorological data from 2010 to 2017 for 28 rain gauge stations were taken from imd indian meteorological department website to prepare a map of annual rainfall patterns of the study area using idw interpolation method in arcgis environment the spatial patterns of different geological and geomorphological features of the study area were digitized from bhukosh geological survey of india online portal and landsat 8 images data the soil data of the study area was downloaded from usda united states department of agriculture online portal www soilgrids org to prepare soil map of the study area a supervised land use land cover classification using maximum likelihood algorithms was performed in envi software for the purpose of accuracy appraisal of lulc classes and geomorphic features validation field visits were conducted in the area under investigation the pre monsoon and post monsoon water level patterns in the study area were delineated using water level data from 2010 to 2017 analogous to the rainfall data the groundwater level data is obtained from spatially distributed wells throughout the study area each district has its own block wise groundwater level information however we have taken the data of groundwater levels from the wells found in the study area belonging from all three districts further the water level fluctuation map was prepared by subtracting the obtained pre monsoon water level values from post monsoon data the resultant figures were converted into spatial database in the form of water level fluctuation map using interpolation technique of spatial analyst tool in arcgis environment the pair wise matrix generation for ahp based analysis involves field experience and expert s opinion about these variables the values were assigned on the basis of relative importance of all the parameters in addition a triangulation irregular network tin map using dem of 10 m resolution was prepared to portray the terrain and flow condition of the study area 3 1 ahp analysis in the present study thematic layers of all the factors that plays crucial role in groundwater occurrence and movement were prepared analysis of each individual factor using ahp is carried out on these layers in the following way 3 2 matrix generation first of all a comparison matrix is established using a saaty 2008 9 point scale priority values for each category such as geology geomorphology rainfall slope drainage density etc in accordance of their importance the 10 point scale values for different parameters are tabulated below table 1 a and table 1 b normalization of priority values for each class was carried out using the addition of the column elements moreover the priority p for each layer was calculated by averaging the row values all the relatively important categories and their assigned priority values with normalized rankings are presented in table 1 a b table 1a 1 b and 2 are also considered as the level 1 matrix generated for ahp based artificial recharge evaluation the same process was again adopted for comparative evaluation between different classes or features of each category or criteria the priority values were assigned by discussing the importance of all the factors with the help of previous literature local field experience and expert s opinion all the features or classes and their assigned priority values category criteria wise are summarized in table 2 the abbreviations used in the table for different classes are as follows dd drainage density sl slope gl geology rf rainfall so soil w water lulc land use land cover and gm geomorphology 4 results 4 1 drainage density the total length of streams of all orders per unit area is defined as the drainage density horton 1945 and indicates the draining condition of the watershed the information of drainage density is crucial due to its inverse relationship with the permeability of the watershed ahmed and sajjad 2018 thapa et al 2017 the drainage density in parts of yamuna river floodplain can be broadly classified in five classes i e very low class 0 02 0 7 low class 0 7 1 4 moderate class 1 4 2 6 high class 2 6 4 7 and very high class 4 7 7 5 fig 2a b and c shows the distribution of drainage density in all three sub watersheds the sw 2 shows very less drainage features as compared to sw 1 and sw 3 the digital elevation model dem over which the drainage features were overlaid further shows traces of old channels in sw 2 and sw 1 that gets extinct recently due to over exploitation of these surface water resources however in general an area of about 13 63 km2 falls under very high drainage density 4 7 7 5 and 51 40 km2 found under high drainage density class 2 6 4 7 besides 521 km2 area falls in very low drainage density 0 02 0 7 and 254 km2 area under low 0 7 1 4 category rest of the area is occupied by the main channel and therefore does not required to prioritize in order to demarcate the artificial recharge sites for the present study 4 2 slope and aspect slope is of vital importance while dealing with groundwater related problems however in low land alluvial river it also seems to be complementary to the topography of the area therefore it is required to highlight the topographical characteristics of the study area and its surroundings the sw 1 and sw 2 shows maximum elevation whereas sw 3 exhibit low relief comprised of fertile alluvial plain with east south east sloping nature fig 2d e and f gentle and flat surfaces allow sufficient time to water to percolate beneath and recharge the underground water resources therefore in the present study high weight is assigned to the low slope class i e for gentle or flat surfaces while dealing with different slope classes in the same manner slope attributes of the area were classified into five different classes including very gentle 0 2 6 gentle 2 6 4 7 moderate 4 7 7 4 steep 7 4 11 35 and very steep 11 35 45 22 class and their areal distribution for all three sub watersheds are given in table 3 in addition the aspect map is also prepared using drtm dem data by resampling it into 10 m resolution fig 3 a b and c the aspect map of all three sub watersheds shows eight classes of different directions whereas one class is of flat category categorically flat surfaces or the gentle slope class dominates the area for all sub watersheds and only valley region shows north and south east sloping trends moreover area wise representation of different slope classes is given in table 3 4 3 rainfall the movement and occurrence of both the ground and surface water is greatly controlled by rainfall thapa et al 2017 it is found to be one of the important factors while dealing with hydrological problems ahmed and sajjad 2018 average annual rainfall data of last eight 2010 2017 years analogous with groundwater level depth were taken to carry out the present study minimum rainfall observed in the study area was found 41 mm year whereas maximum rainfall was 45 76 mm year during the observation period to prepare rainfall map for all three sub watersheds idw interpolation technique in spatial analyst tool was adopted in gis environment fig 3d e and f it clearly depicts the spatial annual variation of rainfall in parts of the agra firozabad and etawah districts the northward portion of sw 1 gets maximum rainfall 44 74 45 76 mm year and a decreasing trend were observed for sw 2 and sw 3 more or less similar trends were also observed for the ground water table values 4 4 geology the southern most parts of the indo gangetic plain in and around the yamuna chambal ravines characterize the study area the alluvial sediments of quaternary age covered the entire area but the nature of these sediments is varying from place to place in general a sequence of clay silt and sands of varying grades with gravel and kanker dominates the region under investigation these quaternary alluvial deposits become thick in sw 1 near agra district and gets thinner in lower topographic areas particularly in and around the sw 3 the younger alluvial sediments resemble indo gangetic plain sediments confined to the northern side of the study area they are believed to be formed by the reworking of sediments through alluvial action however some linear ridges of sandstone outcrop having a general northeast to southeast trend encountered in south western vicinity of sw 2 they might have exerts some control on geology and the existing drainage of the basin khan et al 2018 different geological units encountered in the study area are represented by geological map prepared from the geological data available on bhukosh online portal of geological survey of india fig 4 a b and c brief description of these geological units is given below 4 4 1 channel alluvium newer alluvium recent holocene deposit the channel alluvium of the river is confined to a well defined valley and to the terraces within the main channel the newer alluvium is found to be sandy poor in calcareous matter light in colour and often micaceous it is confined near the river bed and further appears on the southern boundary of sw 2 and sw 3 around chambal valley and show changes in the sediments from clayey to calcareous the low values are assigned to this class due to low water retention capability of the sediments 4 4 2 older alluvium pleistocene deposits the most important material in older alluvium is the clay which at places becomes loamier and loam in this clayey part of alluvium irregular concretion of kankers of various shapes and size are found at different level these kankers are formed by the segregation of calcareous material of alluvial deposits into lumps or nodules the older alluvium is relatively more durable than the channel and terrace alluvium therefore a high value was assigned in ahp based matrix to get probable sites for artificial recharge in general it occupies high altitude areas of sw 1 and sw 2 and show dominance of clay over sand 4 5 geomorphology geomorphology of the area determines the nature of groundwater movement and occurrence to a great extent a geomorphic unit gives direct indication of potential aquifers and infiltration of surface water into the sub surface thapa et al 2017 in the study area river planform features geomorphic units and its sinuous nature was mapped by khan et al 2018 using the landsat 8 datasets there are mainly six geomorphic units in the study area clearly portrayed in the geomorphological map for all three sub watersheds fig 4d e and f these unit includes floodplain 2039 65 km2 river channel 96 03 km2 ravines 803 27 km2 paleochannel 27 39 km2 meander scars 20 22 km2 and sand bars 4 54 km2 most of the groundwater recharging geomorphic units are found concentrated along the main channel particularly in sw 3 including paleochannel meander scar traces of oxbow lakes and sand bars fig 4f therefore high priorities are assigned to paleochannel meander scars and sand bars whereas flat surfaces or low lying surfaces of floodplain are assigned low ranks in order to delineate artificial groundwater recharge sites in the area 4 6 soil texture in groundwater artificial recharge delineation nature of soil inherit paramount importance in present study area soil plays critical role by shaping the terrain and affecting the geomorphology due to highly dissected nature of landscape in the region soil texture determines the amount of infiltration of the bed rock and ultimately the recharging capacity singhai et al 2017 different soil types found in different sub watersheds includes sandy soil sandy loam soil sandy clay soil sandy clay loamy soil luvisol podzol soil regosoil and clayey soil fig 5 a b and c the areal distribution of these soil types for all sub watersheds are given in table 4 which shows that sandy clay loam and sandy loamy soil occupied a major portion of sw 1 and sw 2 whereas entire sw 3 is covered by sandy clay soil some portion of clayey soil is encountered only in sw 2 in general study areas shows greatest variation in occurrence of different soil types 4 7 land use land cover availability of remotely sensed data and different image processing algorithms evidenced to be indispensable in order to assess lulc changes and prepare lulc data singh et al 2014 yadav and deshpande 2015 the satellite data from landsat 8 oli sensor was used to monitor the spatial extent and distribution of lulc during 2016 the landsat 8 data is pre processed to carry out the supervised classification using separate region of interests roi s for different classes the obtained image of lulc fig 5d e and f shows that most effective land use class is agriculture and found mostly concentrated in sw 1 and sw 2 whereas the sw 3 is occupied by barren land due to dominance of ravine class table 5 therefore to sustain agricultural practices in these sub watersheds availability and consumption of water resources are of extreme concern the land use classes according to their sway in groundwater delineation are prioritized and presented in table 1 4 8 water level fluctuation water level is an indicator of atmospheric and pore pressure at the surface and its representation gives an idea about hydraulic gradient of the area ahmed and sajjad 2018 pre monsoon and post monsoon water level patterns and their variability were evaluated using groundwater level data of 2010 2017 the prepared maps for pre and post monsoon period for all three sub watersheds are given in fig 6 a b and c and fig 6d e and f respectively during pre monsoon season the sw 3 exhibit minimum water level 6 23 m bgl whereas sw 1 and sw 2 having significantly higher water levels ranging from 23 to 37 m bgl similarly during post monsoon season very low water level were also observed in the same area encountered in pre monsoon times i e 4 45 25 61 m bgl for sw 3 and 25 42 m bgl for sw 1 and sw 2 respectively further the entire catchment area also shows declining trends of water level in pre monsoon and post monsoon water level maps the water level fluctuation map shows both positive and negative trends in the study area i e both rise and fall in water level fig 7 a b and c sw 3 shows minimum water level fluctuations 2 28 0 45 whereas the central portion of the study area belongs to sw 1 and sw 2 shows maximum fluctuation 1 38 6 89 therefore these two watersheds sw 1 sw 2 are found highly vulnerable for declining ground water resources and consequently required an immediate attention in the study all these localities of declining water levels were assigned higher values in ahp based matrix 4 9 potential recharge zones presented investigation is carried out in and around the main yamuna river channel occupies an overall area of 2975 km2 entire study area is divided into three sub watersheds of area 924 22 km2 716 31 km2 and 1331 71 km2 for sw 1 sw 2 and sw 3 respectively table 6 the ahp tool analyse all the thematic layers and produced a map in raster format for four different classes as zones for artificial recharge fig 8 a b and c these classes are most suitable zone moderately suitable zone less suitable zone and unsuitable zone 4 9 1 most suitable zone the result obtained shows that most suitable zone for artificial recharge occupied an overall area of about 650 km2 as a whole whereas watershed wise maximum most suitable area was found for sw 1 42 and sw 2 35 the sw 1 and sw 2 are having high elevation higher slope low drainage density and lower ground water level therefore most of the mostly suitable area are found in these sub watersheds the fig 8a and b shows dark brownish patches indicates most vulnerable ground water condition areas where immediate treatment is required to improve the condition 4 9 2 moderately suitable zone the moderately suitable zone occupies 42 47 and 42 areas for sw 1 sw 2 and sw 3 respectively showing an overall quietly poor groundwater condition in all three sub watersheds most of the area in the study area is occupied by moderately suitable class in all sub watersheds indicates declining ground water condition in the area this class is characterized by low to moderate slope medium to high elevation low drainage density over the older alluvium 4 9 3 less suitable zone less suitable zone overall occupies an area of 470 km2 15 of the total area under investigation this class is distributed along the main channel or near to the streams of different orders fig 8a b c shows the distribution of less suitable class which is characterized by declining elevation low slope high water table and high drainage density 4 9 4 unsuitable zone overall 15 84 area in all three sub watersheds found unsuitable for artificial recharging due to the presence of main channel shown by pink colour in the final output image of site suitability for artificial recharging fig 8a b and c all the valley ravenous and gully fields falls in this category these are the sites of water and soil moisture storage in high peak summer months and therefore acts like the self recharging geomorphic features however few regions where rainfall is low experience declining water levels therefore needs to get prioritize for artificial recharging 4 10 suitable sites for artificial recharge the final sub watershed wise output map for suitable sites for artificial recharge is presented below fig 9 a b c d overlaid on drainage map along with the tin model of the study area the artificial recharge map prepared in the present study using ahp tool will be beneficial for decision making and planning in order to replenish the groundwater resources of the region the artificial recharge structure including check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks are recommended to build alongside the streams pointed out in the map moreover a detailed fieldwork is a prerequisite for the selection of artificial recharge structure according to its feasibility 5 discussion selection of highly vulnerable sites for artificial groundwater recharge is carried out using different parameters i e drainage density rainfall soil geology geomorphology water table fluctuation soil and lulc layers ahp based weighted overlay analysis high drainage density is confined to in sw 3 whereas the other two sub watersheds witnessed a lack of drainage features this is happened due to the formation of several manmade structures on the main channel of the river before it reaches into the agra region consequently the existing tributaries of the river get dried and ultimately become extinct drainage density is an important parameter for the site selection of artificial recharge shekhar and pandey 2015 therefore in the present study very lesser area gets high priority in terms of drainage density parameter the elevation of the study area ranges from 85 to 200 m above mean sea level indicates almost flat terrain and the highest elevation was found in sw 1 and sw 2 whereas sw 3 shows an almost flat terrain similar observations were also obtained by slope and aspect analysis indicates only the valley region occupied by ravines all along the main channel is under high slope condition very steep slope occupied the largest area in sw 3 due to dominance of ravines along the main channel falls in valley region table 3 rest of the area is almost flat and found very well for percolation of groundwater a steeper slope gives high runoff and low infiltration but the presence of gullies are the sites where high amount of discharged water gets accumulated and provides sufficient time to water to percolate below therefore the area along the main channel in the ravenous class gullies are present is not found suitable for artificial recharge because of its self recharging capacity srtm dem of 30 m resolution is resampled into 10 m and used in the present study for preparing slope aspect and triangular irregular network of the study area the aspect map also shown the similar results as observed in different parameters where flat class occupy most of the area in addition the visual inspection of the map shows that most of the sloping areas around the main channel occupy the east southeast direction in addition the rainfall is another most important factor that regulates the groundwater occurrence kumar and krishna 2018 the western and south western portion of sw 1 and the entire sw 2 consistently receiving lesser rainfall whereas the eastern extremity of sw 3 shows declining trends of rainfall geologically the entire area is covered by older and newer alluvium which is considered relatively good for groundwater recharge however the water retention capability of older alluvium is reported to be high as compared to newer alluvium singh et al 2013 and can be proposed as the potential sites for artificial recharging in this way sw 2 found highly vulnerable for groundwater depletion the geomorphic units found in the study area includes flood plain river channel meander scars sand bars and ravines only flood plain and some portion of ravine class having high relief areas and gullies are not present which is made up of intermixture of several soil types and alluvium material and having relatively higher slope found poor in terms of groundwater recharging and therefore assigned the lowest rank rest of the units found in the vicinity of main channel mainly in sw 3 are filled up with newer alluvium the soil properties including structure porosity adhesion and consistency has a larger impact on its recharging capacity mcgarry 2004 and infiltration rate is also highly dependent on these properties prioritizing the soil types keeping their textural properties in mind is essential in order to determine potential sites for artificial recharge the soil texture triangular diagram is used to assign the value for each type of class found in the study area on the basis of sand silt and clay proportion available in each type further the specific yield of clayey soil 6 and sandy clay soil 12 encountered in sw 1 and sw 2 also suggest that these soil types are bad recharging means for groundwater assigned a lowest value whereas the sand specific yield 25 is assigned the highest value due to its high recharging capacity moreover the consumption and the demand of groundwater is largely controlled by lulc classes existed in the area under investigation kumar et al 2016 in the present study the most vulnerable class in terms of groundwater availability is settlement which is consistently increasing with 20 decadal population growths in the yamuna river floodplain therefore assigned a lower value sw 1 and sw 2 are witnessing a high rate of urbanization as compared to sw 3 however some small scale temporary settlement are common in the ravines along main channel of sw 3 the ravine class also found moderately suitable for recharging the underground water resources due to higher sloping conditions and occupying most of the area of sw 3 however some gullies and ravines permanently holds water and therefore proved to be a potential recharging mean along the main channel ground water level data presented in the study is a temporal and variable component patra et al 2017 the cumulative analysis of eight years water level data and final water level fluctuation map shows the similar trends as observed with different parameters the sw 3 shows very low water level fluctuation and the ground conditions in this portion appears to be constant on the contrary sw 1 and sw 2 shows highly fluctuating conditions probably due to high consumption of groundwater as a consequence of high population load and rapid industrialization finally the study suggests that most affected areas are found in and around sw 2 near firozabad where the failure of hand pumps and submersibles are consistently reported and the patches of poor groundwater condition were also found consistent in all the sub watersheds the regions particularly associated with increasing settlement and high elevations are having poor groundwater resources these observations are further supported by the work carried out by previous workers and agencies 6 conclusion the present research area represents an emblematic example of all the low land rivers of indo gangetic plains therefore we conclude that studies based on selection of artificial recharge sites in order to sustain the health of the river is likely to be distinctive for these low land rivers facing scarcity of water in the presented study about 300 km2 250 km2 and 195 km2 areas is found suitable for artificial recharging in sw 1 sw 2 and sw respectively presented investigation also suggests that sw 1 and sw 2 are highly vulnerable in terms of the occurrence of ground water resources the study successfully elucidates the potential zones for artificial recharge categorically moderately suitable class for all three sub watersheds includes south western uplands of the study area under critical condition the study accentuates the role of integrated geospatial technology along with ahp to deal with declining trends of groundwater resources besides the role of urban sprawl and human intervention on the main river channel causing the increasing rate of

12062,the yamuna river is the part of vast indo gangetic alluvial plain abides a huge scarcity of water in terms of both surface and groundwater resources artificial recharge is the most promising measure in the present scenario to improve the groundwater conditions of the area in the present study artificial recharge sites were delineated using the important factors which plays a pivotal role in groundwater occurrence through analytical hierarchy process ahp based modelling in geographical information system gis environment datasets from different sources and landsat 8 satellite images were used to assign the weightage for different parameters in accordance to their role in site selection for artificial recharging the study shows that the sub watershed 1 lies in the south western upland of agra district and sub watershed 2 which is located in firozabad district occupies an area of 304 km2 42 and 248 km2 35 respectively found under critical groundwater condition in terms of declining groundwater level these sites are located mainly around the settlement areas of relatively higher elevation overall 26 area i e very low water level class in the study area in the presented study exhibit poor groundwater conditions i e 32 42 m bgl and hence required an immediate treatment in terms of artificial technology in order to enrich the water stressed alluvial aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords artificial groundwater recharge zone suitable sites analytical hierarchy process ahp geospatial technology 1 introduction most of world s civilizations takes place around the major river banks since the beginning of our evolution this demonstrates our dependency on these water resources and their associated enriched watersheds recently it has been estimated that around 85 rural 50 urban household and 60 irrigation water demands are met by groundwater in the country kumar and krishna 2018 jasrotia et al 2019 haque et al 2020 adimalla and taloor 2020 taloor et al 2020 but the declining water level of river floodplains is the major concern for hydrologists and environmentalists several new approaches for addressing the worldwide depleting groundwater resources in order to enrich the future trajectory of river health in floodplain areas are the outcome of this graver situation bhat et al 2019 kaur et al 2020 among all these newly grown approaches including multiple criteria decision analysis mcda boolean logic analytical network process anp artificial aquifer recharge using analytical hierarchy process ahp appears to be widely acceptable technique and successfully implemented in several countries like us japan europe middle east africa and india agarwal et al 2013 sener and davraz 2013 shekhar and pandey 2015 jasrotia et al 2016 singh et al 2017 pinto et al 2017 lee et al 2018 muniraj et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 the opted approach of groundwater recharge is variable in nature and depends on the complications integrated with the sustainable development of watersheds agrawal and garg 2016 in order to manage these over exploited alluvial rivers through artificial groundwater recharge required comprehensive knowledge of drainage pattern geology geomorphology and their associated geographical features to reach a reasonable conclusion hao et al 2014 selvarani et al 2017 kothyari et al 2019 taloor et al 2019 these hydrological attributes seems to be strongly related to the interaction of shallow groundwater associated with floodplains in alluvial river to the water in the main channel hancock et al 2005 krause et al 2007 the stream bed characteristics and nature of alluvium determines this inter dependability of groundwater and surface water to a great extent winter 1998 however channel position its plan form features geometry and size also plays a dominant role during the entire process of enriching or depleting the ground water occurrence the present study attempts to provide holistic view of groundwater depletion in the study area along with the delineation of crucial sites which required immediate management several studies have been carried out in and around the study area to highlight the scarcity of surface water in main channel jha et al 1993 singh 2001 misra 2010 soni et al 2013 khan et al 2018 2020 bib khan et al 2018 bib khan et al 2020 however the study area is very less explored in terms of groundwater related studies groundwater recharging is an ancient practice and has been started in chorus with evolution of man over exploitation of these resources reducing the present groundwater levels and also poses a threat for long term aquifer s life groundwater recharge using ponds canals and reservoirs were the conventional methods of groundwater recharging seems to be time consuming and expensive kaliraj et al 2014 the availability of high resolution remote sensing data and use of gis stimulated the groundwater management studies by providing more synoptic and scientific understanding of the terrain elbeih 2015 patra et al 2017 patil et al 2018 adimalla et al 2020 remote sensing technology coupled with gis preferred greatly due to easiness in preparation of huge database over large areas required for the study and limited field checks alam et al 2017 2018 bib alam et al 2017 taloor et al 2017 bib alam et al 2018 taloor et al 2019 sarkar et al 2020 site selection for artificial recharge is the most scientific initiative in order to replenish the groundwater resources more appropriately artificial recharge technique by analysing all the contributing factors including geology geomorphology drainage characteristics slope and land use evidenced to be most promising akinlalu et al 2017 in this regard several geospatial techniques are in frequent use to address the water management practices all over the globe analytical hierarchy process proved to be distinguish among them due to its capability to quantify the subjective judgement of the evaluator as the weights of the criteria is one of the pre requisite factor gdoura et al 2015 arulbalaji et al 2019 the assessment of geometric mean and normalized weight through pair wise comparison matrix for distinguish datasets makes it more comprehensive to deal with groundwater related problems fournier et al 2016 shabbir and ahmad 2016 however the present study is carried out in low lands of an alluvial yamuna river running in vast indo gangetic plain with the objective to enhance the groundwater resources for the sustainable development of entire catchment area of yamuna river concomitantly the study also expounds and emphasizes the role of analytical hierarchy process ahp and geospatial techniques for identification of artificial groundwater recharging sites 2 study area the sub watershed of yamuna river around agra firozabad and etawah district in the western uttar pradesh characterize the area under investigation which is bounded by longitude 78 0 to 79 15 e and latitude 26 30 to 27 15 n fig 1 the present study concentrated on the landscape in and around the main channel of the yamuna river and occupied an area of about 2975 km2 study area is further divided into three sub watersheds named as sw 1 sw 2 and sw 3 occupies an area of 924 km2 716 km2 and 1331 km2 respectively the 150 km long stretch of main channel along with its tributaries falls in toposheets no 54i 3 54i 4 54i 7 and 54 i 8 of survey of india is selected for the present study degradational topography due to dominance of erosional features and highly dissected nature of region further characterize the study area rao et al 2017 ali et al 2019 the yamuna river floodplain in the study area is one of the most polluted and densely populated floodplain and facing the scarcity of water simultaneously gopal and sah 1993 misra 2010 khan et al 2020 the primary source of water in the yamuna river is the south west monsoon and the area under investigation gets minimum flow during pre monsoon season as the natural flow is hindered by several man made obstructions jha et al 1993 the groundwater levels ranges from 6 m bgl to 37 m bgl in pre monsoon period and 4 42 m bgl in post monsoon season in the present study physical appearance of the channel and the amount of run off discharge also suggests that the river becomes effluent in this portion of its journey soni et al 2013 the effluent character of yamuna river in parts of agra firozabad and etawah districts is the consequence of several anthropogenic processes operated over it including waste water inflow and construction of several man made structures which hindered the natural flow of main channel the river emerges in the study area after passing through several barrage and mega cities beyond okhla barrage the fresh surface water in the yamuna river becomes almost extinct the domestic and industrial wastewater produces as a consequence of high population load of national capital region ncr recharging the afterwards portions of the river through shahadra outlet misra 2010 the study area is also cited as the most hydrologically stressed area by several authors sharma and kansal 2006 misra 2010 rai et al 2011 soni et al 2014 the agra district south western extremity of the present study area witnessed a declination of water level from 0 5 to 1 m per year due to the fast urban expansion upadhayay 2017 in this region the dominant occupation is agriculture which further accelerates the demand of fresh water in the region 3 datasets and methodology presented study is carried out using different datasets and tools to process the data which is presented below firstly the entire yamuna river catchment in the study was divided into different sub watersheds using arc hydro tool in arcgis environment it requires srtm dem as input to delineate sub watershed through flow direction flow accumulation stream definition and stream segmentation analysis the delineated sub watershed using srtm dem are the basis for further analysis drainage density and slope attributes of the study area were prepared using the survey of india soi toposheets and srtm dem data respectively the srtm dem data of 30 m resolution is resampled in to 10 m resolution using nearest neighbour resampling approach in arc gis the drainage density layer laid over on digital elevation model dem of the study area to represent the flow condition of surface and groundwater resources meteorological data from 2010 to 2017 for 28 rain gauge stations were taken from imd indian meteorological department website to prepare a map of annual rainfall patterns of the study area using idw interpolation method in arcgis environment the spatial patterns of different geological and geomorphological features of the study area were digitized from bhukosh geological survey of india online portal and landsat 8 images data the soil data of the study area was downloaded from usda united states department of agriculture online portal www soilgrids org to prepare soil map of the study area a supervised land use land cover classification using maximum likelihood algorithms was performed in envi software for the purpose of accuracy appraisal of lulc classes and geomorphic features validation field visits were conducted in the area under investigation the pre monsoon and post monsoon water level patterns in the study area were delineated using water level data from 2010 to 2017 analogous to the rainfall data the groundwater level data is obtained from spatially distributed wells throughout the study area each district has its own block wise groundwater level information however we have taken the data of groundwater levels from the wells found in the study area belonging from all three districts further the water level fluctuation map was prepared by subtracting the obtained pre monsoon water level values from post monsoon data the resultant figures were converted into spatial database in the form of water level fluctuation map using interpolation technique of spatial analyst tool in arcgis environment the pair wise matrix generation for ahp based analysis involves field experience and expert s opinion about these variables the values were assigned on the basis of relative importance of all the parameters in addition a triangulation irregular network tin map using dem of 10 m resolution was prepared to portray the terrain and flow condition of the study area 3 1 ahp analysis in the present study thematic layers of all the factors that plays crucial role in groundwater occurrence and movement were prepared analysis of each individual factor using ahp is carried out on these layers in the following way 3 2 matrix generation first of all a comparison matrix is established using a saaty 2008 9 point scale priority values for each category such as geology geomorphology rainfall slope drainage density etc in accordance of their importance the 10 point scale values for different parameters are tabulated below table 1 a and table 1 b normalization of priority values for each class was carried out using the addition of the column elements moreover the priority p for each layer was calculated by averaging the row values all the relatively important categories and their assigned priority values with normalized rankings are presented in table 1 a b table 1a 1 b and 2 are also considered as the level 1 matrix generated for ahp based artificial recharge evaluation the same process was again adopted for comparative evaluation between different classes or features of each category or criteria the priority values were assigned by discussing the importance of all the factors with the help of previous literature local field experience and expert s opinion all the features or classes and their assigned priority values category criteria wise are summarized in table 2 the abbreviations used in the table for different classes are as follows dd drainage density sl slope gl geology rf rainfall so soil w water lulc land use land cover and gm geomorphology 4 results 4 1 drainage density the total length of streams of all orders per unit area is defined as the drainage density horton 1945 and indicates the draining condition of the watershed the information of drainage density is crucial due to its inverse relationship with the permeability of the watershed ahmed and sajjad 2018 thapa et al 2017 the drainage density in parts of yamuna river floodplain can be broadly classified in five classes i e very low class 0 02 0 7 low class 0 7 1 4 moderate class 1 4 2 6 high class 2 6 4 7 and very high class 4 7 7 5 fig 2a b and c shows the distribution of drainage density in all three sub watersheds the sw 2 shows very less drainage features as compared to sw 1 and sw 3 the digital elevation model dem over which the drainage features were overlaid further shows traces of old channels in sw 2 and sw 1 that gets extinct recently due to over exploitation of these surface water resources however in general an area of about 13 63 km2 falls under very high drainage density 4 7 7 5 and 51 40 km2 found under high drainage density class 2 6 4 7 besides 521 km2 area falls in very low drainage density 0 02 0 7 and 254 km2 area under low 0 7 1 4 category rest of the area is occupied by the main channel and therefore does not required to prioritize in order to demarcate the artificial recharge sites for the present study 4 2 slope and aspect slope is of vital importance while dealing with groundwater related problems however in low land alluvial river it also seems to be complementary to the topography of the area therefore it is required to highlight the topographical characteristics of the study area and its surroundings the sw 1 and sw 2 shows maximum elevation whereas sw 3 exhibit low relief comprised of fertile alluvial plain with east south east sloping nature fig 2d e and f gentle and flat surfaces allow sufficient time to water to percolate beneath and recharge the underground water resources therefore in the present study high weight is assigned to the low slope class i e for gentle or flat surfaces while dealing with different slope classes in the same manner slope attributes of the area were classified into five different classes including very gentle 0 2 6 gentle 2 6 4 7 moderate 4 7 7 4 steep 7 4 11 35 and very steep 11 35 45 22 class and their areal distribution for all three sub watersheds are given in table 3 in addition the aspect map is also prepared using drtm dem data by resampling it into 10 m resolution fig 3 a b and c the aspect map of all three sub watersheds shows eight classes of different directions whereas one class is of flat category categorically flat surfaces or the gentle slope class dominates the area for all sub watersheds and only valley region shows north and south east sloping trends moreover area wise representation of different slope classes is given in table 3 4 3 rainfall the movement and occurrence of both the ground and surface water is greatly controlled by rainfall thapa et al 2017 it is found to be one of the important factors while dealing with hydrological problems ahmed and sajjad 2018 average annual rainfall data of last eight 2010 2017 years analogous with groundwater level depth were taken to carry out the present study minimum rainfall observed in the study area was found 41 mm year whereas maximum rainfall was 45 76 mm year during the observation period to prepare rainfall map for all three sub watersheds idw interpolation technique in spatial analyst tool was adopted in gis environment fig 3d e and f it clearly depicts the spatial annual variation of rainfall in parts of the agra firozabad and etawah districts the northward portion of sw 1 gets maximum rainfall 44 74 45 76 mm year and a decreasing trend were observed for sw 2 and sw 3 more or less similar trends were also observed for the ground water table values 4 4 geology the southern most parts of the indo gangetic plain in and around the yamuna chambal ravines characterize the study area the alluvial sediments of quaternary age covered the entire area but the nature of these sediments is varying from place to place in general a sequence of clay silt and sands of varying grades with gravel and kanker dominates the region under investigation these quaternary alluvial deposits become thick in sw 1 near agra district and gets thinner in lower topographic areas particularly in and around the sw 3 the younger alluvial sediments resemble indo gangetic plain sediments confined to the northern side of the study area they are believed to be formed by the reworking of sediments through alluvial action however some linear ridges of sandstone outcrop having a general northeast to southeast trend encountered in south western vicinity of sw 2 they might have exerts some control on geology and the existing drainage of the basin khan et al 2018 different geological units encountered in the study area are represented by geological map prepared from the geological data available on bhukosh online portal of geological survey of india fig 4 a b and c brief description of these geological units is given below 4 4 1 channel alluvium newer alluvium recent holocene deposit the channel alluvium of the river is confined to a well defined valley and to the terraces within the main channel the newer alluvium is found to be sandy poor in calcareous matter light in colour and often micaceous it is confined near the river bed and further appears on the southern boundary of sw 2 and sw 3 around chambal valley and show changes in the sediments from clayey to calcareous the low values are assigned to this class due to low water retention capability of the sediments 4 4 2 older alluvium pleistocene deposits the most important material in older alluvium is the clay which at places becomes loamier and loam in this clayey part of alluvium irregular concretion of kankers of various shapes and size are found at different level these kankers are formed by the segregation of calcareous material of alluvial deposits into lumps or nodules the older alluvium is relatively more durable than the channel and terrace alluvium therefore a high value was assigned in ahp based matrix to get probable sites for artificial recharge in general it occupies high altitude areas of sw 1 and sw 2 and show dominance of clay over sand 4 5 geomorphology geomorphology of the area determines the nature of groundwater movement and occurrence to a great extent a geomorphic unit gives direct indication of potential aquifers and infiltration of surface water into the sub surface thapa et al 2017 in the study area river planform features geomorphic units and its sinuous nature was mapped by khan et al 2018 using the landsat 8 datasets there are mainly six geomorphic units in the study area clearly portrayed in the geomorphological map for all three sub watersheds fig 4d e and f these unit includes floodplain 2039 65 km2 river channel 96 03 km2 ravines 803 27 km2 paleochannel 27 39 km2 meander scars 20 22 km2 and sand bars 4 54 km2 most of the groundwater recharging geomorphic units are found concentrated along the main channel particularly in sw 3 including paleochannel meander scar traces of oxbow lakes and sand bars fig 4f therefore high priorities are assigned to paleochannel meander scars and sand bars whereas flat surfaces or low lying surfaces of floodplain are assigned low ranks in order to delineate artificial groundwater recharge sites in the area 4 6 soil texture in groundwater artificial recharge delineation nature of soil inherit paramount importance in present study area soil plays critical role by shaping the terrain and affecting the geomorphology due to highly dissected nature of landscape in the region soil texture determines the amount of infiltration of the bed rock and ultimately the recharging capacity singhai et al 2017 different soil types found in different sub watersheds includes sandy soil sandy loam soil sandy clay soil sandy clay loamy soil luvisol podzol soil regosoil and clayey soil fig 5 a b and c the areal distribution of these soil types for all sub watersheds are given in table 4 which shows that sandy clay loam and sandy loamy soil occupied a major portion of sw 1 and sw 2 whereas entire sw 3 is covered by sandy clay soil some portion of clayey soil is encountered only in sw 2 in general study areas shows greatest variation in occurrence of different soil types 4 7 land use land cover availability of remotely sensed data and different image processing algorithms evidenced to be indispensable in order to assess lulc changes and prepare lulc data singh et al 2014 yadav and deshpande 2015 the satellite data from landsat 8 oli sensor was used to monitor the spatial extent and distribution of lulc during 2016 the landsat 8 data is pre processed to carry out the supervised classification using separate region of interests roi s for different classes the obtained image of lulc fig 5d e and f shows that most effective land use class is agriculture and found mostly concentrated in sw 1 and sw 2 whereas the sw 3 is occupied by barren land due to dominance of ravine class table 5 therefore to sustain agricultural practices in these sub watersheds availability and consumption of water resources are of extreme concern the land use classes according to their sway in groundwater delineation are prioritized and presented in table 1 4 8 water level fluctuation water level is an indicator of atmospheric and pore pressure at the surface and its representation gives an idea about hydraulic gradient of the area ahmed and sajjad 2018 pre monsoon and post monsoon water level patterns and their variability were evaluated using groundwater level data of 2010 2017 the prepared maps for pre and post monsoon period for all three sub watersheds are given in fig 6 a b and c and fig 6d e and f respectively during pre monsoon season the sw 3 exhibit minimum water level 6 23 m bgl whereas sw 1 and sw 2 having significantly higher water levels ranging from 23 to 37 m bgl similarly during post monsoon season very low water level were also observed in the same area encountered in pre monsoon times i e 4 45 25 61 m bgl for sw 3 and 25 42 m bgl for sw 1 and sw 2 respectively further the entire catchment area also shows declining trends of water level in pre monsoon and post monsoon water level maps the water level fluctuation map shows both positive and negative trends in the study area i e both rise and fall in water level fig 7 a b and c sw 3 shows minimum water level fluctuations 2 28 0 45 whereas the central portion of the study area belongs to sw 1 and sw 2 shows maximum fluctuation 1 38 6 89 therefore these two watersheds sw 1 sw 2 are found highly vulnerable for declining ground water resources and consequently required an immediate attention in the study all these localities of declining water levels were assigned higher values in ahp based matrix 4 9 potential recharge zones presented investigation is carried out in and around the main yamuna river channel occupies an overall area of 2975 km2 entire study area is divided into three sub watersheds of area 924 22 km2 716 31 km2 and 1331 71 km2 for sw 1 sw 2 and sw 3 respectively table 6 the ahp tool analyse all the thematic layers and produced a map in raster format for four different classes as zones for artificial recharge fig 8 a b and c these classes are most suitable zone moderately suitable zone less suitable zone and unsuitable zone 4 9 1 most suitable zone the result obtained shows that most suitable zone for artificial recharge occupied an overall area of about 650 km2 as a whole whereas watershed wise maximum most suitable area was found for sw 1 42 and sw 2 35 the sw 1 and sw 2 are having high elevation higher slope low drainage density and lower ground water level therefore most of the mostly suitable area are found in these sub watersheds the fig 8a and b shows dark brownish patches indicates most vulnerable ground water condition areas where immediate treatment is required to improve the condition 4 9 2 moderately suitable zone the moderately suitable zone occupies 42 47 and 42 areas for sw 1 sw 2 and sw 3 respectively showing an overall quietly poor groundwater condition in all three sub watersheds most of the area in the study area is occupied by moderately suitable class in all sub watersheds indicates declining ground water condition in the area this class is characterized by low to moderate slope medium to high elevation low drainage density over the older alluvium 4 9 3 less suitable zone less suitable zone overall occupies an area of 470 km2 15 of the total area under investigation this class is distributed along the main channel or near to the streams of different orders fig 8a b c shows the distribution of less suitable class which is characterized by declining elevation low slope high water table and high drainage density 4 9 4 unsuitable zone overall 15 84 area in all three sub watersheds found unsuitable for artificial recharging due to the presence of main channel shown by pink colour in the final output image of site suitability for artificial recharging fig 8a b and c all the valley ravenous and gully fields falls in this category these are the sites of water and soil moisture storage in high peak summer months and therefore acts like the self recharging geomorphic features however few regions where rainfall is low experience declining water levels therefore needs to get prioritize for artificial recharging 4 10 suitable sites for artificial recharge the final sub watershed wise output map for suitable sites for artificial recharge is presented below fig 9 a b c d overlaid on drainage map along with the tin model of the study area the artificial recharge map prepared in the present study using ahp tool will be beneficial for decision making and planning in order to replenish the groundwater resources of the region the artificial recharge structure including check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks are recommended to build alongside the streams pointed out in the map moreover a detailed fieldwork is a prerequisite for the selection of artificial recharge structure according to its feasibility 5 discussion selection of highly vulnerable sites for artificial groundwater recharge is carried out using different parameters i e drainage density rainfall soil geology geomorphology water table fluctuation soil and lulc layers ahp based weighted overlay analysis high drainage density is confined to in sw 3 whereas the other two sub watersheds witnessed a lack of drainage features this is happened due to the formation of several manmade structures on the main channel of the river before it reaches into the agra region consequently the existing tributaries of the river get dried and ultimately become extinct drainage density is an important parameter for the site selection of artificial recharge shekhar and pandey 2015 therefore in the present study very lesser area gets high priority in terms of drainage density parameter the elevation of the study area ranges from 85 to 200 m above mean sea level indicates almost flat terrain and the highest elevation was found in sw 1 and sw 2 whereas sw 3 shows an almost flat terrain similar observations were also obtained by slope and aspect analysis indicates only the valley region occupied by ravines all along the main channel is under high slope condition very steep slope occupied the largest area in sw 3 due to dominance of ravines along the main channel falls in valley region table 3 rest of the area is almost flat and found very well for percolation of groundwater a steeper slope gives high runoff and low infiltration but the presence of gullies are the sites where high amount of discharged water gets accumulated and provides sufficient time to water to percolate below therefore the area along the main channel in the ravenous class gullies are present is not found suitable for artificial recharge because of its self recharging capacity srtm dem of 30 m resolution is resampled into 10 m and used in the present study for preparing slope aspect and triangular irregular network of the study area the aspect map also shown the similar results as observed in different parameters where flat class occupy most of the area in addition the visual inspection of the map shows that most of the sloping areas around the main channel occupy the east southeast direction in addition the rainfall is another most important factor that regulates the groundwater occurrence kumar and krishna 2018 the western and south western portion of sw 1 and the entire sw 2 consistently receiving lesser rainfall whereas the eastern extremity of sw 3 shows declining trends of rainfall geologically the entire area is covered by older and newer alluvium which is considered relatively good for groundwater recharge however the water retention capability of older alluvium is reported to be high as compared to newer alluvium singh et al 2013 and can be proposed as the potential sites for artificial recharging in this way sw 2 found highly vulnerable for groundwater depletion the geomorphic units found in the study area includes flood plain river channel meander scars sand bars and ravines only flood plain and some portion of ravine class having high relief areas and gullies are not present which is made up of intermixture of several soil types and alluvium material and having relatively higher slope found poor in terms of groundwater recharging and therefore assigned the lowest rank rest of the units found in the vicinity of main channel mainly in sw 3 are filled up with newer alluvium the soil properties including structure porosity adhesion and consistency has a larger impact on its recharging capacity mcgarry 2004 and infiltration rate is also highly dependent on these properties prioritizing the soil types keeping their textural properties in mind is essential in order to determine potential sites for artificial recharge the soil texture triangular diagram is used to assign the value for each type of class found in the study area on the basis of sand silt and clay proportion available in each type further the specific yield of clayey soil 6 and sandy clay soil 12 encountered in sw 1 and sw 2 also suggest that these soil types are bad recharging means for groundwater assigned a lowest value whereas the sand specific yield 25 is assigned the highest value due to its high recharging capacity moreover the consumption and the demand of groundwater is largely controlled by lulc classes existed in the area under investigation kumar et al 2016 in the present study the most vulnerable class in terms of groundwater availability is settlement which is consistently increasing with 20 decadal population growths in the yamuna river floodplain therefore assigned a lower value sw 1 and sw 2 are witnessing a high rate of urbanization as compared to sw 3 however some small scale temporary settlement are common in the ravines along main channel of sw 3 the ravine class also found moderately suitable for recharging the underground water resources due to higher sloping conditions and occupying most of the area of sw 3 however some gullies and ravines permanently holds water and therefore proved to be a potential recharging mean along the main channel ground water level data presented in the study is a temporal and variable component patra et al 2017 the cumulative analysis of eight years water level data and final water level fluctuation map shows the similar trends as observed with different parameters the sw 3 shows very low water level fluctuation and the ground conditions in this portion appears to be constant on the contrary sw 1 and sw 2 shows highly fluctuating conditions probably due to high consumption of groundwater as a consequence of high population load and rapid industrialization finally the study suggests that most affected areas are found in and around sw 2 near firozabad where the failure of hand pumps and submersibles are consistently reported and the patches of poor groundwater condition were also found consistent in all the sub watersheds the regions particularly associated with increasing settlement and high elevations are having poor groundwater resources these observations are further supported by the work carried out by previous workers and agencies 6 conclusion the present research area represents an emblematic example of all the low land rivers of indo gangetic plains therefore we conclude that studies based on selection of artificial recharge sites in order to sustain the health of the river is likely to be distinctive for these low land rivers facing scarcity of water in the presented study about 300 km2 250 km2 and 195 km2 areas is found suitable for artificial recharging in sw 1 sw 2 and sw respectively presented investigation also suggests that sw 1 and sw 2 are highly vulnerable in terms of the occurrence of ground water resources the study successfully elucidates the potential zones for artificial recharge categorically moderately suitable class for all three sub watersheds includes south western uplands of the study area under critical condition the study accentuates the role of integrated geospatial technology along with ahp to deal with declining trends of groundwater resources besides the role of urban sprawl and human intervention on the main river channel causing the increasing rate of

adsorbents for removal of various kinds of pollutants from wastewaters bhaumik et al 2013 the main objective of the present study consists of the removal of metronidazole as a representative emerging pollutant from aqueous solutions using chemically synthesized polyaniline polypyrrole ppy pani copolymer the influence of various physicochemical parameters including ppy pani dosage initial ph of the solution initial metronidazole concentration contact time and temperature on the adsorption of metronidazole on polyaniline polypyrrole were examined also the isotherm kinetics and thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process were estimated to evaluate their accordance with the experiments and to predicate the solution adsorbent interfacial phenomena furthermore the adsorption mechanism of metronidazole on the ppy pani surface was investigated by employing quantum calculation using density functional theory dft to support the experimental findings according to literature survey the present work is the first study to synthesize ppy pani copolymer in order to determine its promising use for the removal of pharmaceutical metronidazole from wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the pyrrole and aniline monomers were purified by distillation before being used as reagents in the polymerization reaction the iron chloride acetone methanol and metronidazole were of analytical grade reagents all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received the stock solution of metronidazole was prepared by dissolving 1 g of metronidazole in 1 l of distilled water the solutions used in the adsorption experiments were prepared by successive dilutions of the stock solution 2 2 synthesis of ppy pani copolymer the synthesis of the ppy pani copolymer is carried out at room temperature by chemical oxidative polymerization of the aniline and pyrrole mixture laabd et al 2019 the ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o was used as an oxidizing agent typically 6 g of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in 80 ml of distilled water then was added dropwise into the mixture 0 8 ml of aniline and pyrrole monomers with an aniline pyrrole ratio 1 after stirring for 5 min the solution became black afterward the solution is allowed to stand without stirring for 6 h in order to stop the polymerization reaction 10 ml of acetone was added to the mixture then the obtained product was filtered and washed several times with distilled water and acetone finally the ppy pani copolymer was dried at 80 c for 6 h 2 3 analysis method the adsorption experiments were carried out in a batch mode by varying initial ph of the solution 2 10 contact time 0 480 min initial metronidazole concentration 10 200 mg l and temperature 25 50 c the ph of the solution was adjusted by the addition of hcl or naoh 1m the study of operating parameters was performed by using the one variable at a time approach after each adsorption test the adsorbent was separated from the liquid phase by membrane millipore filter with a porosity of 0 45 μm the analysis of the samples was carried out before and after adsorption using uv visible spectrophotometry spectrophotometer 2300uv at 320 8 nm as the maximum absorption wavelength of metronidazole the adsorption capacity qe and removal efficiency r can be calculated by the following equations 1 q e c 0 ce v m in mg g 2 r c 0 ce c 0 100 where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentration in mg l of metronidazole respectively m g is the amount of ppy pani and v l is the volume of metronidazole solution 2 4 quantum chemical methodology to characterize the intermolecular interactions during the metronidazole adsorption on the ppy pani surface the quantum chemical calculation is an important tool to describe the phenomena that occur at a microscopic scale benafqir et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 density functional theory dft is a reliable computational method to predicate the adsorption mechanism via investigation of the energetic structural and electronic parameters of both adsorbent and adsorbate molecules herein we have optimized the molecular structures of ppy pani copolymer and metronidazole using dft b3lyp 6 31g d method implemented in gaussian 09 the gaussview 05 software was used as an interface to perform the calculation the absence of imaginary frequencies was used to confirm the equilibrium state of the molecular structures all calculations were based on the conductor like polarizable continuum model cpcm as the solvation model cossi et al 2003 the interaction energy between the metronidazole and ppy pani copolymer was calculated according to the following equation 3 δ e i n t e p p y p a n i metronidazole e p p y p a n i e metronidazole where e ppy pani metronidazole is the total energy of the ppy pani after adsorption of metronidazole e ppy pani is the total energy of the ppy pani copolymer e metronidazole is the total energy of the metronidazole the charge transfer δq between the metronidazole and the ppy pani during the adsorption process was determined as follows 4 δ q q p p y p a n i q p p y p a n i m e t r o n i d a z o l e where q p p y p a n i and q p p y p a n i m e t r o n i d a z o l e are the total net charges of the ppy pani copolymer before and after adsorption of metronidazole 3 results and discussion 3 1 ppy pani surface characterization fig 1 illustrates the images of the surface of ppy pani copolymer captured by using a scanning electron microscopy esem fei quanta 200 the surface analysis indicates that the ppy pani exhibited a very irregular and porous granular structure also a great heterogeneity in the grain size and the pore shapes was observed besides the textural properties of the ppy pani copolymer are close to those of the polyaniline and polypyrrole laabd et al 2016b 2017a this open structure promotes the diffusion of adsorbate molecules into the internal surface of the ppy pani thus these results may be considered as a favorable indication for the use of ppy pani copolymer as adsorbent material for the treatment of wastewater the structure of ppy pani copolymer was identified using a vertex 70 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 0 5 cm 1 the ftir spectrum of ppy pani is illustrated in fig 2 the peaks located at 3441 and 1631 cm 1 are respectively related to stretching and bending vibrations of o h groups of physisorbed water on the surface of pani ppy the characteristic bands observed at 960 847 and 1038 cm 1 demonstrate the deformation and stretching of c h the absorption band of conjugated c n stretching was located at 1449 cm 1 the peak observed at 1542 cm 1 may be assigned to the pyrrole ring stretching maity and ray 2008 the bands appeared at 1122 and 1571 cm 1 are associated to the stretching deformation of quinonoid ring in the polyaniline the peak at 1495 cm 1 is characteristic of benzenoid ring stretching deformation in addition the characteristic band situated at 1288 cm 1 was attributed to c n stretching deformation in the aromatic amines of the polyaniline xu et al 2008 these results reflect that the ppy pani copolymer was successfully synthesized 3 2 adsorption study 3 2 1 effect of ppy pani dosage the adsorbent dosage played an important influence on the adsorption process therefore it is of great importance to determine the minimum adsorbent dose required to reach the maximum removal percentage of metronidazole in this study the effect of the ppy pani dose was investigated as a function of adsorbent dosage ranging from 0 05 to 0 70 g l as shown in fig 3 the metronidazole removal efficiency increases significantly with increasing ppy pani copolymer dosage the adsorption trend means an increase in the number of available active sites when the adsorbent dose increased ajmal et al 2018 hsini et al 2020 the highest removal efficiency of metronidazole was found to be 89 24 for the ppy pani dose of 0 40 g l however with a further increase in ppy pani dose beyond 0 40 g l the metronidazole adsorption percentage remains almost constant this could be explained by the agglomeration of ppy pani particles at higher adsorbent doses hsini et al 2020 thereby 0 40 g l of ppy pani was chosen as the optimum adsorbent dose in the next adsorption experiments 3 2 2 effect of ph the solution ph is one of the most influential parameters in the adsorption process since it affects the charge of the adsorbent surface as well as the ionization state of the adsorbate molecules ajmal et al 2020b the effect of ph on the metronidazole removal by ppy pani copolymer was studied over a wide ph range from 2 to 12 the experimental results are given in fig 4 as the initial ph increases at acidic conditions ph 6 2 the removal efficiency of metronidazole was increased this was due to the deprotonation of metronidazole pka 2 55 and protonation of amine groups of the ppy pani copolymer thereby promoting the electrostatic attractions between the negative charges of metronidazole and the positively charged surface of ppy pani adsorbent nh3 at ph 6 2 it can be observed that the adsorption of metronidazole was dramatically decreased with increasing the solution ph this phenomenon could be attributed to the competition between oh ions and deprotonated metronidazole for adsorption sites the optimum ph for metronidazole adsorption onto ppy pani was determined to be 6 2 3 2 3 adsorption kinetics the sorption rate is an important criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of an adsorbent material for wastewater purification purposes to determine the adsorption rate and optimum contact time for the removal of metronidazole molecules the uptake capacity of the ppy pani copolymer was studied as a function of contact time from fig 5 a it was clearly shown that the uptake capacity increases with increasing contact time at the first times of adsorption process the equilibrium takes place after 3000 min of adsorbent solution contact the observed trend is probably attributed to the fact which at initial all adsorption sites of ppy pani copolymer were vacant and available for metronidazole molecules then the metronidazole removal efficiency slightly increased as a result of the decrease in vacant active sites on the ppy pani surface until the equilibrium is reached at 300 min therefore 300 min was chosen as the optimum time for metronidazole adsorption onto ppy pani copolymer to study the adsorption kinetics of metronidazole on the ppy pani the experimental data were analyzed by the pseudo first order pseudo second order ho 2006 and intra particle diffusion wang et al 2011 models the equations of these kinetic models are expressed as below 5 pseudo first order model q t q e 1 e k 1 t 6 pseudo second order model q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 7 intraparticle diffusion model q t k i n t t 0 5 β where qe and qt are the uptake capacities mg g at equilibrium and time t respectively k1 1 min k2 mg g min and kint mg g min0 5 are the equilibrium rate constants of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models respectively β is a constant that characterizes the thickness of the boundary layer the fitting curves using the above presented models are shown in fig 5 the values of kinetics constants calculated by nonlinear regression analysis are listed in table 1 based on the correlation coefficient r2 values the pseudo first order kinetic model presents good fitness to the experimental data compared to the pseudo second order model furthermore the value of the adsorbed amount at the equilibrium calculated by pseudo first order model qe 1 22 63 mg g is very close to that measured experimentally qe exp 22 24 mg g which confirms that the pseudo first order model tends to be more suitable for predicting the adsorption behavior of metronidazole on the ppy pani surface the intra particle diffusion model was used to examine the transfer mechanism of metronidazole from the solution to the ppy pani surface during the adsorption process from fig 5b it can be seen that the graphical presentation of the intra particle diffusion model presents multilinear plots three linear portions indicating that the adsorption of metronidazole onto ppy pani can be described by three steps rout et al 2014 the first one presents the film diffusion of metronidazole molecules from the solution to the external ppy pani surface the second step is the intra particle diffusion of metronidazole into the ppy pani pores the third stage corresponds to the adsorption equilibrium the values of intra particle diffusion rate constants are given in table 1 the diffusion rate can be ordered as kint 1 kint 2 kint 3 this means that the metronidazole adsorption is rapid during the external diffusion onto ppy pani surface then the adsorption rate becomes slower during the penetration of metronidazole molecules into the pores of ppy pani copolymer finally when the adsorption equilibrium state is reached the uptake capacity remains almost the same 3 2 4 equilibrium study the effect of metronidazole initial concentration on the adsorption of metronidazole onto ppy pani was investigated in concentrations range of 10 200 mg l the equilibrium experimental data are shown in fig 6 it is obvious that the adsorbed amount of metronidazole increased significantly with increasing its concentration up to a maximum uptake capacity of 63 84 mg g this trend is probably due to the fact that the active sites on the ppy pani surface were not saturated at low concentrations of metronidazole sun et al 2015 therefore at higher initial concentrations the increase in the metronidazole adsorption resulted from an enhancement in the mass transfer driving force form the solution to the solid phase to identify the distribution of metronidazole molecules at the ppy pani solution interface the equilibrium data were analyzed by using langmuir and freundlich isotherm models according to ho 2004 the application of nonlinear forms of isotherm models to the experimental equilibrium results is more suitable than the linearized forms the langmuir model equation is expressed as el ouardi et al 2019 8 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e the freundlich model equation is given as el ouardi et al 2019 9 q e k f c e 1 n where qe mg g is the equilibrium adsorbed amount ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of metronidazole qmax mg g is the maximum uptake capacity and kl and kf are the equilibrium constants of langmuir and freundlich isotherms respectively n is freundlich constant related to adsorption intensity the separation factor rl is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the reversibility of the adsorption process özcan et al 2004 rl can be defined based on the langmuir equilibrium constant and initial concentration of metronidazole according to the following expression 10 r l 1 1 k l c 0 based on the values of rl the adsorption may be unfavorable if rl 1 linear if rl 1 favorable if 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 the equilibrium parameters calculated from non linear regression analysis based on the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models fig 6 are listed in table 2 the results demonstrated that the correlation coefficient r2 value of the freundlich model 0 955 was found to be high than that of langmuir isotherm 0 895 this implies that the freundlich isotherm model provides a better description of metronidazole adsorption on the ppy pani copolymer in addition rl values are between 0 02 and 0 32 proving that the metronidazole adsorption onto ppy pani is a favorable process and therefore ppy pani copolymer exhibits a strong affinity toward metronidazole molecules these findings allowed us to conclude that the adsorption of metronidazole occurs as a multilayer coverage of metronidazole molecules on the heterogeneous ppy pani surface 3 2 5 thermodynamic parameters to determine the nature of the metronidazole adsorption on the ppy pani copolymer the thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy change δh entropy change δs and gibbs free energy change δg are calculated as follows 13 δ g t rln k d 14 ln k d δ s r δ h r t 15 δ g δ h t δ s the distribution coefficient kd is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium uptake capacity qe to the adsorbate concentration in the solution at equilibrium k d q e c e r 8 314 j mol k is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature of the solution the values of thermodynamic parameters were determined graphically by linear regression analysis from fig 7 and are presented in table 3 the overall values of gibbs free energy change are negative suggesting that the adsorption of metronidazole onto ppy pani copolymer is a spontaneous process in nature also the δg values increase with the increasing temperature of the solution this indicates that the adsorption becomes less favorable at high temperatures the value of enthalpy change is negative 37 324 kj mol which indicates that the adsorption is exothermic and physisorption type under 40 kj mol demirbas et al 2019 the negative value of revealed that the metronidazole molecules were distributed regularly on the surface of ppy pani copolymer demirbaş and nas 2016 4 dft study of the adsorption of metronidazole on the ppy pani 4 1 molecular electrostatic potential the distribution of molecular electrostatic potential mep and electron density on the optimal geometries of the adsorbate and adsorbent molecules was calculated to identify the sites of nucleophilic and electrophilic attack aarab et al 2019a fig 8 illustrates the meps of pani ppy and metronidazole the obtained results show that the oxygenated groups of metronidazole have a high negative electron density mainly delocalized on the oh and no2 functional groups red color this indicates that these groups may be considered as nucleophilic attack sites of molecules of metronidazole also the amine functional groups of dianiline dipyrrole lead to a high positive electron density blue color this suggests that the amine groups are sites of electrophilic attack for the pani ppy copolymer according to these results the adsorption mechanism of metronidazole on the pani ppy can be carried out through interactions between the nucleophilic groups containing oxygen atoms and electrophiles nh 4 2 charge transfer to characterize the charge transfer behavior during the adsorption of metronidazole on the ppy pani copolymer the electronic charges of these molecules after the optimization of their geometries as well as that of the adsorbent adsorbate complex are calculated the analysis of the charge changes of the adsorbent adsorbate complex makes it possible to determine the direction of the electron transfer during the adsorption process the obtained results showed that metronidazole has lost an electron density of 0 235 e this electron density moves towards the adsorbent material ppy pani the transferred charge value indicates that the adsorption is of a physisorption process 4 3 intermolecular distances the distances between ppy pani and metronidazole are determined from the optimized structures of the complex ppy pani metronidazole fig 9 shows the optimal molecular geometry of the ppy pani metronidazole complex from this result it is noted that the metronidazole adsorption occurs via the formation of hydrogen bonds the smallest distance is of the order of 2 009 å between the oxygenated groups of metronidazole and the hydrogen atoms of the nitrogenous groups of the ppy pani copolymer in addition the intermolecular distances between the hydrogen atoms of the aromatic cycles of the adsorbent and metronidazole are very large this shows that the mechanism of adsorption of metronidazole on the surface of the ppy pani copolymer is based essentially on weak interactions between the oxygen group metronidazole of the adsorbate and nitrogenous groups of the ppy pani 4 4 interaction energies to further characterize the interactions between metronidazole and ppy pani the energy study on metronidazole complexation by the ppy pani copolymer was performed using dft with the base b3lyp 6 31g d based on the total energies of the metronidazole and ppy pani molecules the calculation of the interaction energy during the adsorption process is performed the formation energy of the ppy pani metronidazole complex was found to be 0 261 a u this negative value may indicate that the formed complex is a stable molecular system furthermore this stability of the adsorbent adsorbate complex makes it possible to deduce that the ppy pani has a good ability to adsorb metronidazole from aqueous solutions 5 conclusion in the present work the ppy pani copolymer was fabricated and was further evaluated for metronidazole removal in aqueous solutions the obtained results as a function of different physicochemical parameters i e ph initial concentration adsorption time ppy pani amount and temperature for metronidazole adsorption over ppy pani copolymer allows to draw the following conclusions the metronidazole adsorption over ppy pani adsorption reaches the equilibrium point within 300 min and the maximum removal percentage of metronidazole was 88 96 the metronidazole kinetic adsorption data was successfully simulated via pseudo first order model r2 0 994 the better simulation of equilibrium adsorption data was notices by employing freundlich model r2 0 955 maximum uptake capacity at fixed adsorbent dose 0 4 g l adsorption time 300 min ph 6 2 and temperature 25 c was found to be 63 84 mg g thermodynamically metronidazole adsorption over ppy pani copolymer surface sites was spontaneous δg 0 and exothermic δh 37 324 kj mol in nature the adsorption mechanism of metronidazole on the ppy pani surface sites was further characterized by quantum chemical calculations using dft method the theoretical findings indicated that metronidazole adsorption has lower interaction energy of 0 261 a u thus these finding clearly indicated that the adsorption process was mainly controlled by physical interactions between ppy pani and metronidazole which is in good agreement with the experimental results in summary the good metronidazole uptake capacity of ppy pani copolymer further makes it a promising material for the removal of emerging

pollutant from aqueous solutions using chemically synthesized polyaniline polypyrrole ppy pani copolymer the influence of various physicochemical parameters including ppy pani dosage initial ph of the solution initial metronidazole concentration contact time and temperature on the adsorption of metronidazole on polyaniline polypyrrole were examined also the isotherm kinetics and thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process were estimated to evaluate their accordance with the experiments and to predicate the solution adsorbent interfacial phenomena furthermore the adsorption mechanism of metronidazole on the ppy pani surface was investigated by employing quantum calculation using density functional theory dft to support the experimental findings according to literature survey the present work is the first study to synthesize ppy pani copolymer in order to determine its promising use for the removal of pharmaceutical metronidazole from wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the pyrrole and aniline monomers were purified by distillation before being used as reagents in the polymerization reaction the iron chloride acetone methanol and metronidazole were of analytical grade reagents all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received the stock solution of metronidazole was prepared by dissolving 1 g of metronidazole in 1 l of distilled water the solutions used in the adsorption experiments were prepared by successive dilutions of the stock solution 2 2 synthesis of ppy pani copolymer the synthesis of the ppy pani copolymer is carried out at room temperature by chemical oxidative polymerization of the aniline and pyrrole mixture laabd et al 2019 the ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o was used as an oxidizing agent typically 6 g of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in 80 ml of distilled water then was added dropwise into the mixture 0 8 ml of aniline and pyrrole monomers with an aniline pyrrole ratio 1 after stirring for 5 min the solution became black afterward the solution is allowed to stand without stirring for 6 h in order to stop the polymerization reaction 10 ml of acetone was added to the mixture then the obtained product was filtered and washed several times with distilled water and acetone finally the ppy pani copolymer was dried at 80 c for 6 h 2 3 analysis method the adsorption experiments were carried out in a batch mode by varying initial ph of the solution 2 10 contact time 0 480 min initial metronidazole concentration 10 200 mg l and temperature 25 50 c the ph of the solution was adjusted by the addition of hcl or naoh 1m the study of operating parameters was performed by using the one variable at a time approach after each adsorption test the adsorbent was separated from the liquid phase by membrane millipore filter with a porosity of 0 45 μm the analysis of the samples was carried out before and after adsorption using uv visible spectrophotometry spectrophotometer 2300uv at 320 8 nm as the maximum absorption wavelength of metronidazole the adsorption capacity qe and removal efficiency r can be calculated by the following equations 1 q e c 0 ce v m in mg g 2 r c 0 ce c 0 100 where c0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentration in mg l of metronidazole respectively m g is the amount of ppy pani and v l is the volume of metronidazole solution 2 4 quantum chemical methodology to characterize the intermolecular interactions during the metronidazole adsorption on the ppy pani surface the quantum chemical calculation is an important tool to describe the phenomena that occur at a microscopic scale benafqir et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 density functional theory dft is a reliable computational method to predicate the adsorption mechanism via investigation of the energetic structural and electronic parameters of both adsorbent and adsorbate molecules herein we have optimized the molecular structures of ppy pani copolymer and metronidazole using dft b3lyp 6 31g d method implemented in gaussian 09 the gaussview 05 software was used as an interface to perform the calculation the absence of imaginary frequencies was used to confirm the equilibrium state of the molecular structures all calculations were based on the conductor like polarizable continuum model cpcm as the solvation model cossi et al 2003 the interaction energy between the metronidazole and ppy pani copolymer was calculated according to the following equation 3 δ e i n t e p p y p a n i metronidazole e p p y p a n i e metronidazole where e ppy pani metronidazole is the total energy of the ppy pani after adsorption of metronidazole e ppy pani is the total energy of the ppy pani copolymer e metronidazole is the total energy of the metronidazole the charge transfer δq between the metronidazole and the ppy pani during the adsorption process was determined as follows 4 δ q q p p y p a n i q p p y p a n i m e t r o n i d a z o l e where q p p y p a n i and q p p y p a n i m e t r o n i d a z o l e are the total net charges of the ppy pani copolymer before and after adsorption of metronidazole 3 results and discussion 3 1 ppy pani surface characterization fig 1 illustrates the images of the surface of ppy pani copolymer captured by using a scanning electron microscopy esem fei quanta 200 the surface analysis indicates that the ppy pani exhibited a very irregular and porous granular structure also a great heterogeneity in the grain size and the pore shapes was observed besides the textural properties of the ppy pani copolymer are close to those of the polyaniline and polypyrrole laabd et al 2016b 2017a this open structure promotes the diffusion of adsorbate molecules into the internal surface of the ppy pani thus these results may be considered as a favorable indication for the use of ppy pani copolymer as adsorbent material for the treatment of wastewater the structure of ppy pani copolymer was identified using a vertex 70 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir in the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 0 5 cm 1 the ftir spectrum of ppy pani is illustrated in fig 2 the peaks located at 3441 and 1631 cm 1 are respectively related to stretching and bending vibrations of o h groups of physisorbed water on the surface of pani ppy the characteristic bands observed at 960 847 and 1038 cm 1 demonstrate the deformation and stretching of c h the absorption band of conjugated c n stretching was located at 1449 cm 1 the peak observed at 1542 cm 1 may be assigned to the pyrrole ring stretching maity and ray 2008 the bands appeared at 1122 and 1571 cm 1 are associated to the stretching deformation of quinonoid ring in the polyaniline the peak at 1495 cm 1 is characteristic of benzenoid ring stretching deformation in addition the characteristic band situated at 1288 cm 1 was attributed to c n stretching deformation in the aromatic amines of the polyaniline xu et al 2008 these results reflect that the ppy pani copolymer was successfully synthesized 3 2 adsorption study 3 2 1 effect of ppy pani dosage the adsorbent dosage played an important influence on the adsorption process therefore it is of great importance to determine the minimum adsorbent dose required to reach the maximum removal percentage of metronidazole in this study the effect of the ppy pani dose was investigated as a function of adsorbent dosage ranging from 0 05 to 0 70 g l as shown in fig 3 the metronidazole removal efficiency increases significantly with increasing ppy pani copolymer dosage the adsorption trend means an increase in the number of available active sites when the adsorbent dose increased ajmal et al 2018 hsini et al 2020 the highest removal efficiency of metronidazole was found to be 89 24 for the ppy pani dose of 0 40 g l however with a further increase in ppy pani dose beyond 0 40 g l the metronidazole adsorption percentage remains almost constant this could be explained by the agglomeration of ppy pani particles at higher adsorbent doses hsini et al 2020 thereby 0 40 g l of ppy pani was chosen as the optimum adsorbent dose in the next adsorption experiments 3 2 2 effect of ph the solution ph is one of the most influential parameters in the adsorption process since it affects the charge of the adsorbent surface as well as the ionization state of the adsorbate molecules ajmal et al 2020b the effect of ph on the metronidazole removal by ppy pani copolymer was studied over a wide ph range from 2 to 12 the experimental results are given in fig 4 as the initial ph increases at acidic conditions ph 6 2 the removal efficiency of metronidazole was increased this was due to the deprotonation of metronidazole pka 2 55 and protonation of amine groups of the ppy pani copolymer thereby promoting the electrostatic attractions between the negative charges of metronidazole and the positively charged surface of ppy pani adsorbent nh3 at ph 6 2 it can be observed that the adsorption of metronidazole was dramatically decreased with increasing the solution ph this phenomenon could be attributed to the competition between oh ions and deprotonated metronidazole for adsorption sites the optimum ph for metronidazole adsorption onto ppy pani was determined to be 6 2 3 2 3 adsorption kinetics the sorption rate is an important criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of an adsorbent material for wastewater purification purposes to determine the adsorption rate and optimum contact time for the removal of metronidazole molecules the uptake capacity of the ppy pani copolymer was studied as a function of contact time from fig 5 a it was clearly shown that the uptake capacity increases with increasing contact time at the first times of adsorption process the equilibrium takes place after 3000 min of adsorbent solution contact the observed trend is probably attributed to the fact which at initial all adsorption sites of ppy pani copolymer were vacant and available for metronidazole molecules then the metronidazole removal efficiency slightly increased as a result of the decrease in vacant active sites on the ppy pani surface until the equilibrium is reached at 300 min therefore 300 min was chosen as the optimum time for metronidazole adsorption onto ppy pani copolymer to study the adsorption kinetics of metronidazole on the ppy pani the experimental data were analyzed by the pseudo first order pseudo second order ho 2006 and intra particle diffusion wang et al 2011 models the equations of these kinetic models are expressed as below 5 pseudo first order model q t q e 1 e k 1 t 6 pseudo second order model q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t 7 intraparticle diffusion model q t k i n t t 0 5 β where qe and qt are the uptake capacities mg g at equilibrium and time t respectively k1 1 min k2 mg g min and kint mg g min0 5 are the equilibrium rate constants of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models respectively β is a constant that characterizes the thickness of the boundary layer the fitting curves using the above presented models are shown in fig 5 the values of kinetics constants calculated by nonlinear regression analysis are listed in table 1 based on the correlation coefficient r2 values the pseudo first order kinetic model presents good fitness to the experimental data compared to the pseudo second order model furthermore the value of the adsorbed amount at the equilibrium calculated by pseudo first order model qe 1 22 63 mg g is very close to that measured experimentally qe exp 22 24 mg g which confirms that the pseudo first order model tends to be more suitable for predicting the adsorption behavior of metronidazole on the ppy pani surface the intra particle diffusion model was used to examine the transfer mechanism of metronidazole from the solution to the ppy pani surface during the adsorption process from fig 5b it can be seen that the graphical presentation of the intra particle diffusion model presents multilinear plots three linear portions indicating that the adsorption of metronidazole onto ppy pani can be described by three steps rout et al 2014 the first one presents the film diffusion of metronidazole molecules from the solution to the external ppy pani surface the second step is the intra particle diffusion of metronidazole into the ppy pani pores the third stage corresponds to the adsorption equilibrium the values of intra particle diffusion rate constants are given in table 1 the diffusion rate can be ordered as kint 1 kint 2 kint 3 this means that the metronidazole adsorption is rapid during the external diffusion onto ppy pani surface then the adsorption rate becomes slower during the penetration of metronidazole molecules into the pores of ppy pani copolymer finally when the adsorption equilibrium state is reached the uptake capacity remains almost the same 3 2 4 equilibrium study the effect of metronidazole initial concentration on the adsorption of metronidazole onto ppy pani was investigated in concentrations range of 10 200 mg l the equilibrium experimental data are shown in fig 6 it is obvious that the adsorbed amount of metronidazole increased significantly with increasing its concentration up to a maximum uptake capacity of 63 84 mg g this trend is probably due to the fact that the active sites on the ppy pani surface were not saturated at low concentrations of metronidazole sun et al 2015 therefore at higher initial concentrations the increase in the metronidazole adsorption resulted from an enhancement in the mass transfer driving force form the solution to the solid phase to identify the distribution of metronidazole molecules at the ppy pani solution interface the equilibrium data were analyzed by using langmuir and freundlich isotherm models according to ho 2004 the application of nonlinear forms of isotherm models to the experimental equilibrium results is more suitable than the linearized forms the langmuir model equation is expressed as el ouardi et al 2019 8 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e the freundlich model equation is given as el ouardi et al 2019 9 q e k f c e 1 n where qe mg g is the equilibrium adsorbed amount ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of metronidazole qmax mg g is the maximum uptake capacity and kl and kf are the equilibrium constants of langmuir and freundlich isotherms respectively n is freundlich constant related to adsorption intensity the separation factor rl is a dimensionless constant that characterizes the reversibility of the adsorption process özcan et al 2004 rl can be defined based on the langmuir equilibrium constant and initial concentration of metronidazole according to the following expression 10 r l 1 1 k l c 0 based on the values of rl the adsorption may be unfavorable if rl 1 linear if rl 1 favorable if 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 the equilibrium parameters calculated from non linear regression analysis based on the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models fig 6 are listed in table 2 the results demonstrated that the correlation coefficient r2 value of the freundlich model 0 955 was found to be high than that of langmuir isotherm 0 895 this implies that the freundlich isotherm model provides a better description of metronidazole adsorption on the ppy pani copolymer in addition rl values are between 0 02 and 0 32 proving that the metronidazole adsorption onto ppy pani is a favorable process and therefore ppy pani copolymer exhibits a strong affinity toward metronidazole molecules these findings allowed us to conclude that the adsorption of metronidazole occurs as a multilayer coverage of metronidazole molecules on the heterogeneous ppy pani surface 3 2 5 thermodynamic parameters to determine the nature of the metronidazole adsorption on the ppy pani copolymer the thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy change δh entropy change δs and gibbs free energy change δg are calculated as follows 13 δ g t rln k d 14 ln k d δ s r δ h r t 15 δ g δ h t δ s the distribution coefficient kd is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium uptake capacity qe to the adsorbate concentration in the solution at equilibrium k d q e c e r 8 314 j mol k is the gas constant and t is the absolute temperature of the solution the values of thermodynamic parameters were determined graphically by linear regression analysis from fig 7 and are presented in table 3 the overall values of gibbs free energy change are negative suggesting that the adsorption of metronidazole onto ppy pani copolymer is a spontaneous process in nature also the δg values increase with the increasing temperature of the solution this indicates that the adsorption becomes less favorable at high temperatures the value of enthalpy change is negative 37 324 kj mol which indicates that the adsorption is exothermic and physisorption type under 40 kj mol demirbas et al 2019 the negative value of revealed that the metronidazole molecules were distributed regularly on the surface of ppy pani copolymer demirbaş and nas 2016 4 dft study of the adsorption of metronidazole on the ppy pani 4 1 molecular electrostatic potential the distribution of molecular electrostatic potential mep and electron density on the optimal geometries of the adsorbate and adsorbent molecules was calculated to identify the sites of nucleophilic and electrophilic attack aarab et al 2019a fig 8 illustrates the meps of pani ppy and metronidazole the obtained results show that the oxygenated groups of metronidazole have a high negative electron density mainly delocalized on the oh and no2 functional groups red color this indicates that these groups may be considered as nucleophilic attack sites of molecules of metronidazole also the amine functional groups of dianiline dipyrrole lead to a high positive electron density blue color this suggests that the amine groups are sites of electrophilic attack for the pani ppy copolymer according to these results the adsorption mechanism of metronidazole on the pani ppy can be carried out through interactions between the nucleophilic groups containing oxygen atoms and electrophiles nh 4 2 charge transfer to characterize the charge transfer behavior during the adsorption of metronidazole on the ppy pani copolymer the electronic charges of these molecules after the optimization of their geometries as well as that of the adsorbent adsorbate complex are calculated the analysis of the charge changes of the adsorbent adsorbate complex makes it possible to determine the direction of the electron transfer during the adsorption process the obtained results showed that metronidazole has lost an electron density of 0 235 e this electron density moves towards the adsorbent material ppy pani the transferred charge value indicates that the adsorption is of a physisorption process 4 3 intermolecular distances the distances between ppy pani and metronidazole are determined from the optimized structures of the complex ppy pani metronidazole fig 9 shows the optimal molecular geometry of the ppy pani metronidazole complex from this result it is noted that the metronidazole adsorption occurs via the formation of hydrogen bonds the smallest distance is of the order of 2 009 å between the oxygenated groups of metronidazole and the hydrogen atoms of the nitrogenous groups of the ppy pani copolymer in addition the intermolecular distances between the hydrogen atoms of the aromatic cycles of the adsorbent and metronidazole are very large this shows that the mechanism of adsorption of metronidazole on the surface of the ppy pani copolymer is based essentially on weak interactions between the oxygen group metronidazole of the adsorbate and nitrogenous groups of the ppy pani 4 4 interaction energies to further characterize the interactions between metronidazole and ppy pani the energy study on metronidazole complexation by the ppy pani copolymer was performed using dft with the base b3lyp 6 31g d based on the total energies of the metronidazole and ppy pani molecules the calculation of the interaction energy during the adsorption process is performed the formation energy of the ppy pani metronidazole complex was found to be 0 261 a u this negative value may indicate that the formed complex is a stable molecular system furthermore this stability of the adsorbent adsorbate complex makes it possible to deduce that the ppy pani has a good ability to adsorb metronidazole from aqueous solutions 5 conclusion in the present work the ppy pani copolymer was fabricated and was further evaluated for metronidazole removal in aqueous solutions the obtained results as a function of different physicochemical parameters i e ph initial concentration adsorption time ppy pani amount and temperature for metronidazole adsorption over ppy pani copolymer allows to draw the following conclusions the metronidazole adsorption over ppy pani adsorption reaches the equilibrium point within 300 min and the maximum removal percentage of metronidazole was 88 96 the metronidazole kinetic adsorption data was successfully simulated via pseudo first order model r2 0 994 the better simulation of equilibrium adsorption data was notices by employing freundlich model r2 0 955 maximum uptake capacity at fixed adsorbent dose 0 4 g l adsorption time 300 min ph 6 2 and temperature 25 c was found to be 63 84 mg g thermodynamically metronidazole adsorption over ppy pani copolymer surface sites was spontaneous δg 0 and exothermic δh 37 324 kj mol in nature the adsorption mechanism of metronidazole on the ppy pani surface sites was further characterized by quantum chemical calculations using dft method the theoretical findings indicated that metronidazole adsorption has lower interaction energy of 0 261 a u thus these finding clearly indicated that the adsorption process was mainly controlled by physical interactions between ppy pani and metronidazole which is in good agreement with the experimental results in summary the good metronidazole uptake capacity of ppy pani copolymer further makes it a promising material for the removal of emerging pharmaceutical contaminants from wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

prepare the land use land cover map the irs liss 3 satellite image is classified into different land use land cover types adopting the maximum likelihood method of supervised classification in erdas imagine software the principle component analysis pca 1 is computed for liss 3 satellite image considering spectral tool in erdas imagine software based on the results of pca 1 the lineaments of the study area are extracted with the help of line algorithm tool of pci geomatica software finally extracted lineaments of the study area are validated with already prepared lineament 50k theme layer of the study area as well as entire india by the nrsc available at thematic services option of nrsc portal downloaded from https bhuvan nrsc gov in in addition to this the extracted lineaments are also verified with lineaments of district resource map of gsi and an excellent uniformity of lineaments is found among all now the lineament density map is prepared in arcgis software using idw method of spatial analyst tool as per requirement the thematic maps are geo referenced adopting universal transverse mercator utm projection world geodetic survey 84 wgs and 45 n zone the seven selected important hydro geological factors are mutually interdependent and impact on the occurrence and movement of groundwater after the preparation of all thematic layers the ahp model is applied here to calculate the weight of each factor and their sub classes based on influencing capacity of each factor in the development of groundwater fig 3 this model is considered as one of the most popular and widely accepted methods of multi criteria decision making mcdm and employed in various studies for natural resources monitoring ramanathan 2001 schmoldt 2011 guaita martínez et al 2019 the ahp model is capable to reduce complexity in problems and helps in taking simplified decisions adopting best views of experts based on comparisons kannan 2010 punniyamoorty et al 2012 çelik 2019 this model has multidimensional applications and may be used in the fields of rank orders decision making resource allocation and prioritization the best part of the ahp is to quantify the weight of a particular factor in numerical form on the basis of relative importance of that factor with the other factors of the hierarchy akadiri and olomolaiye 2012 waris et al 2019 additionally consistency index ci is another advantage of this model which helps to justify the judgment value of decision makers saaty and vargas 1982 the ahp model includes four stages such as weight assignment pair wise comparison matrix normalization of weight consistency assessment gangadharan et al 2016 benjmel et al 2020 at first all the seven factors are assigned weights depending on literature review and field visits ranging from 1 to 9 table 1 based on their relative influence in the occurrence of groundwater saaty 1990 mukherjee et al 2012 shekhar and pandey 2014 das and pal 2019 in the next step a pair wise comparison matrix w is developed to compare all the factors with each other formula 1 the process of normalization of weights w ij is obtained formula 2 from the matrix table table 2 using eigen vector technique as proposed by saaty nithya et al 2019 neissi et al 2020 here m is the geometric mean of i th factor 1 w f 11 f 12 f 1 n f 21 f 22 f 2 n f n 1 f n 2 f n n 2 w i j m m the consistency ratio cr is done to verify the judgment coherence and it is computed dividing ci by random consistency index rci and represented algebraically in the below 3 c r c i r c i to accept the judgment values the value of cr needs to be less than 0 1 otherwise a new comparison matrix has to be computed taking new judgment values for all parameters until the cr value does not come down to less than 0 1 the ci is computed using the following expression 4 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ max is the principle eigen value and n denotes the total number of factors the rci is obtained from table 1 which is proposed by saaty in 1980 saaty 1990 each of the thematic map of individual factor is classified into certain sub classes based on the characteristics of concerned map feature here the same procedure of assigning weight to all sub classes is performed considering their level of influence in the occurrence of groundwater and then sub classes are ranked accordingly table 3 now the groundwater potential zone index gpzi is calculated using following formula where weight of each factor is denoted by f w and rank of sub classes is represented by f r this process generates the final output of groundwater potential zones gpz involving all the thematic layers in arcgis software 5 g p z i 1 n f w f r the completion of this operation results in dimensionless values of gpz map ranging from 2 67 to 5 97 gpzi this range is categorized into five distinct classes such as very poor poor moderate good and very good in the applied model all the seven factors have different influencing capacities in occurrence of groundwater here an attempt has been made to understand the level of influence of an individual factor in the availability of groundwater potentiality thus the sensitivity analysis is done here excluding a single factor at a time out of all seven selected factors to perceive the amount of change occurred in the output of gpz map djémin et al 2016 mandal et al 2016 thapa et al 2017 following equation is used for sensitivity analysis 6 p c i j g p z i j g p z i j z 100 here i represents factor number j depicts type of potential zone very poor poor moderate good and very good g p z i j indicates the j th type of gpz area excluding i th factor g p z i j denotes the j th type of gpz area considering all factors z is the total basin area and p c i j is used to indicate the percentage of change in gpz of the j th type omitting i th factor any simulation model is incomplete without its validation finally the kappa co efficient and overall accuracy assessment are computed to assess the level of accuracy and acceptance of the model a total number of 89 pre existing dug wells are taken randomly across the basin to collect groundwater level data of the pre monsoon for the month of april 2019 to validate with the prepared gpz map 4 results and discussion 4 1 geology the upper kangsabati river basin is situated over the cratonic part of west bengal and jharkhand sharma 2009 the basin area is consisted of different rock types of various geological ages ranging from proterozoic to quaternary sen et al 1998 geological survey of india 2001 most of the basin area is covered with granitic gneiss 53 18 followed by micha schist 33 83 and hornblende schist 11 78 of cggc table 3 distribution of clay with caliche concretion which is the only quaternary unconsolidated sedimentary deposition is found in a few pockets over the basin area this quaternary deposition is considered to be more favourable in the groundwater development followed by the weathered and fractured granitic gneiss and micha schist guru et al 2017 gnanachandrasamy et al 2018 specific yield of granitic gneiss and micha schist is found to be almost same and these rocks yield more groundwater compared to the other hard rocks in the area gec 2015 2017 in general the river basin can be divided into two based on dominance of major rock groups the upper portion of the basin is mainly comprised of granitic gneiss while the lower portion is highly dominated by the micha schist fig 4 this type of hard rocks holds moderate to high groundwater in aquifers mainly with the help of secondary porosity gec 2015 2017 4 2 lineament density any discontinuity over the rock surface in the forms of joints fractures faults share zones and rock cleavages is known as lineaments singhal and gupta 2010 ghosh et al 2020 these geomorphological features most of the time resulting from tectonic deformation of rocks are seen over or beneath the earth surface o leary et al 1976 ghosh et al 2020 the cgwb 2017 already mentions that the shallow aquifers of this study region have huge importance in producing groundwater the higher lineament density in an area ultimately represents higher groundwater potentiality haridas et al 1998 because lineaments are the source of secondary porosity abdullah et al 2009 fagbohun 2018 so there is a positive relation between lineament density and groundwater potentiality more than 54 of the study area enjoys high lineament density while a significant portion of 16 81 of area distributed along the southern part of the study area experiences low lineament density table 3 the central part of the basin is observed more suitable for groundwater exploration due to availability of high lineament density fig 5 4 3 slope slope is an important factor in the process of groundwater development the topographical variation of elevation is known as slope yeh et al 2016 siva et al 2017 the rate of percolation and infiltration of water into the ground is highly determined by amount of slope the high degree of slope of topography will definitely discourage the groundwater recharge thus an inverse relation exists between degree of slope and water percolation jaiswal et al 2003 shankar and mohan 2006 an area of 65 30 of the river basin comes under the less than 3 degree of topographical slope table 3 basically this proportion of the basin area will have the more probability in availability of groundwater the higher amount of slope of more than 7 covering an area of 2 87 is observed along the southern margin of the basin due to presence of residual hillocks namely kendapara pahar 22 50ʹ33 73ʹʹ n and 86 31ʹ28 71ʹʹ e udalbani dungri 22 49ʹ45 66ʹʹ n and 86 32ʹ42 65ʹʹ e mangala dungri 22 51ʹ24 81ʹʹ n and 86 29ʹ11 10ʹʹ e jharnakocha 23 0ʹ39 04ʹʹ n and 86 28ʹ08 25ʹʹ e karalikol 22 04ʹ32 20ʹʹ n and 86 37ʹ33 79ʹʹ e etc higher concentration of moderate type of slope is more prominent in the middle and southern sections of the basin fig 6 4 4 drainage density the total length of rivers in a unit of area is termed as drainage density horton 1932 it also shows the closeness of stream spacing kale and gupta 2001 and drainage density is mainly determined by lithology slope rainfall soil and vegetation of an area prabhakaran and jawahar raj 2018 a spatial unit with high degree of drainage density many a time experiences impermeable lithology strahler 1956 huggett 2007 steep slope huggett 2007 patra et al 2018 sparse vegetation chorley 1957 resmi et al 2019 and high runoff morisawa 1962 huggett 2007 most of the basin area 68 98 experiences moderate to high drainage density table 3 the highest drainage density areas appear in four distinct places over the map either circular or elliptical shapes due to high variation in degree of slope fig 7 around 31 of the basin area enjoys low to very low drainage density which is considered to be more suitable to have good potentiality of groundwater table 3 4 5 rainfall rainfall is the prime source to recharge aquifers in the study area the rate of rainfall determines amount of percolation of water into the ground patra et al 2018 the rainfall of the area is mainly influenced by the south west monsoon and occurs during july to september maity and mandal 2019 ghosh 2019 the high intensity rainfall for short duration is common here which restricts high rate of rain water infiltration into the ground due to rolling topography government of west bengal 2017 das et al 2019 the entire upper kangsabati river basin does not receive uniform pattern of rainfall the higher amount of rainfall is enjoyed by different pockets of the basin area such as north west south east and east in contrast the lowest amount of rainfall is experienced in circular pockets of middle and north east areas of the basin fig 8 this heterogeneity in terms of rainfall across the basin is mainly for the areal vastness of the study of interest though only an amount of 6 54 of the basin area receives rainfall in between 1100 mm and 1207 mm table 3 4 6 soil the movement of groundwater in the unsaturated zone is largely controlled by soil kumar et al 2020 the texture structure and pore space of soil determine the permeability ghosh et al 2020 and rate of groundwater recharge depends on the infiltration capacity of water into the soil arulbalaji et al 2019 ghosh et al 2020 the study area is mainly dominated by the sandy loam soil followed by skeletal soil sandy clay loam and coarse sandy loam table 3 the permeability of the coarse sandy loam is highest followed by skeletal soil sandy loam and sandy clay loam government of india 2020 the southern portion is covered by sandy clay loam while the almost north and east portions are dominated by sandy loam in contrast the skeletal soil is mainly observed in western side of the basin and three patches of coarse sandy loam are seen in north and east directions fig 9 4 7 land use land cover the land use land cover also influences soil moisture water infiltration surface water runoff etc which play determinant roles arulbalaji et al 2019 with growing vegetations during the rainy season the changing land use land cover greatly influences the runoff rate das et al 2017 most of the basin area is used for agricultural practices with a share of 52 22 of agricultural land total forest area including both shallow and dense forests is 26 66 while land without scrub is observed to be 8 28 only 2 81 of the basin is used for built up area table 3 the biggest water body is clearly seen in the form of reservoir mainly in south east direction of the basin fig 10 4 8 groundwater potential zones the integration of rs and gis techniques with ahp model helps to produce groundwater prospect zones map as a final result for the upper kangsabati river basin based on the dimensionless gpzi values the potentiality of groundwater of the studied region is found to be good to very good with 53 33 of area the high groundwater potentiality is mainly concentrated on the upper part of the basin due to high lineament density high rainfall low drainage density gentle slope and coarse sandy loam and skeletal soils only 17 44 of area of the whole basin is expected to have very poor to poor groundwater prospect zones around 30 of the basin area bears moderate type of possibility of groundwater prospect table 4 the southern part of the basin possesses poor chances of groundwater availability fig 11 4 9 validation of groundwater potential zones map the probability to have groundwater depending on the map of gpz will only be possible if the map is validated with the data of ground level reference points ghosh et al 2020 here an accuracy assessment is required to perform for assessing the validity of the developed model to do the same a total number of 89 dug wells data of groundwater level are collected across the basin the groundwater level in these dug wells varies from 1 mbgl to 12 9 mbgl which is classified into five distinct classes such as very good 4 5 mbgl good 4 5 mbgl to 5 5 mbgl moderate 5 5 mbgl to 6 3 mbgl poor 6 3 mbgl to 7 9 mbgl and very poor 7 9 mbgl to 12 9 mbgl using natural break classify system of arcgis software the overall accuracy assessment level is computed as 79 77 which justifies the validity of the model here the kappa co efficient is also calculated to perceive the agreement level between calculated value of gpz adopting different hydro geological factors and ground level reference points nasir et al 2018 ghosh et al 2020 the value of the kappa co efficient lies in between 0 and 1 in general the perfect agreement and the less than chance of agreement are represented by 1 and 0 respectively viera and garrett 2005 ghosh et al 2020 in the present study the calculated value of the kappa co efficient is 0 73 which refers that a substantial agreement is found in between the computed and reference points 4 10 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is used to understand the contribution of an individual factor in occurrence of groundwater and also helps to chalk out the percentage of area changes for a category patra et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 the removal of a relevant thematic layer or factor during the operation of the sensitivity analysis certainly influences the results of the final output of the study table 5 the negative and positive values of table 5 represent a decrease and an increase in area of different categories respectively the exclusion of slope increases 9 39 and 6 06 area of very poor and poor categories of gpz respectively in contrast the reduction of geology land use land cover drainage density soil and rainfall enhances area of 3 99 for good 5 07 for moderate 7 04 for good 7 59 for poor and 6 85 for very good respectively the exclusion of lineament density land use land cover and rainfall reduces area of 2 23 for moderate 7 64 for very good and 2 90 for poor categories respectively the elimination of slope may reduce an area of 15 45 from moderate to very good categories while drainage density and soil reduce 8 03 and 8 19 area in total for different categories respectively 5 conclusion to overcome the limitations of geo physical investigation of gpz the application of rs and gis has eased the process of assessment by simplifying it the upper kangsabati river basin enjoys an area of 1819 45 km2 53 33 with good to very good prospect of groundwater followed by moderate prospect area of 1000 69 km2 29 33 only an area of 591 23 km2 17 34 bears very poor to poor groundwater potentiality it is unveiled from the sensitivity analysis that the factor slope influences most the occurrence of groundwater followed by land use land cover soil drainage density and rainfall the result of the overall accuracy assessment of the study comes up with a value of 79 77 which upholds the validity of the study the population density of 1478 villages of the basin area is 415 km2 while it is 382 km2 for india in 2011 census of india 2011 thus the population pressure of the area is also high a large number of populations of the study area mainly rely on river water due to unsuccessful borehole drillings but unfortunately the non perennial nature of rivers of the kangsabati river basin cannot supply water to the inhabitants during summer times this situation can only be changed if the identified zones of good groundwater prospects are explored scientifically this study also opens new ways of investigations related to groundwater storage nature of aquifers rate of recharge water quality groundwater table etc the present work may be found useful by the policy makers to identify suitable sites for artificial recharge and management of groundwater resource for sustainable use declaration of

the study area as well as entire india by the nrsc available at thematic services option of nrsc portal downloaded from https bhuvan nrsc gov in in addition to this the extracted lineaments are also verified with lineaments of district resource map of gsi and an excellent uniformity of lineaments is found among all now the lineament density map is prepared in arcgis software using idw method of spatial analyst tool as per requirement the thematic maps are geo referenced adopting universal transverse mercator utm projection world geodetic survey 84 wgs and 45 n zone the seven selected important hydro geological factors are mutually interdependent and impact on the occurrence and movement of groundwater after the preparation of all thematic layers the ahp model is applied here to calculate the weight of each factor and their sub classes based on influencing capacity of each factor in the development of groundwater fig 3 this model is considered as one of the most popular and widely accepted methods of multi criteria decision making mcdm and employed in various studies for natural resources monitoring ramanathan 2001 schmoldt 2011 guaita martínez et al 2019 the ahp model is capable to reduce complexity in problems and helps in taking simplified decisions adopting best views of experts based on comparisons kannan 2010 punniyamoorty et al 2012 çelik 2019 this model has multidimensional applications and may be used in the fields of rank orders decision making resource allocation and prioritization the best part of the ahp is to quantify the weight of a particular factor in numerical form on the basis of relative importance of that factor with the other factors of the hierarchy akadiri and olomolaiye 2012 waris et al 2019 additionally consistency index ci is another advantage of this model which helps to justify the judgment value of decision makers saaty and vargas 1982 the ahp model includes four stages such as weight assignment pair wise comparison matrix normalization of weight consistency assessment gangadharan et al 2016 benjmel et al 2020 at first all the seven factors are assigned weights depending on literature review and field visits ranging from 1 to 9 table 1 based on their relative influence in the occurrence of groundwater saaty 1990 mukherjee et al 2012 shekhar and pandey 2014 das and pal 2019 in the next step a pair wise comparison matrix w is developed to compare all the factors with each other formula 1 the process of normalization of weights w ij is obtained formula 2 from the matrix table table 2 using eigen vector technique as proposed by saaty nithya et al 2019 neissi et al 2020 here m is the geometric mean of i th factor 1 w f 11 f 12 f 1 n f 21 f 22 f 2 n f n 1 f n 2 f n n 2 w i j m m the consistency ratio cr is done to verify the judgment coherence and it is computed dividing ci by random consistency index rci and represented algebraically in the below 3 c r c i r c i to accept the judgment values the value of cr needs to be less than 0 1 otherwise a new comparison matrix has to be computed taking new judgment values for all parameters until the cr value does not come down to less than 0 1 the ci is computed using the following expression 4 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ max is the principle eigen value and n denotes the total number of factors the rci is obtained from table 1 which is proposed by saaty in 1980 saaty 1990 each of the thematic map of individual factor is classified into certain sub classes based on the characteristics of concerned map feature here the same procedure of assigning weight to all sub classes is performed considering their level of influence in the occurrence of groundwater and then sub classes are ranked accordingly table 3 now the groundwater potential zone index gpzi is calculated using following formula where weight of each factor is denoted by f w and rank of sub classes is represented by f r this process generates the final output of groundwater potential zones gpz involving all the thematic layers in arcgis software 5 g p z i 1 n f w f r the completion of this operation results in dimensionless values of gpz map ranging from 2 67 to 5 97 gpzi this range is categorized into five distinct classes such as very poor poor moderate good and very good in the applied model all the seven factors have different influencing capacities in occurrence of groundwater here an attempt has been made to understand the level of influence of an individual factor in the availability of groundwater potentiality thus the sensitivity analysis is done here excluding a single factor at a time out of all seven selected factors to perceive the amount of change occurred in the output of gpz map djémin et al 2016 mandal et al 2016 thapa et al 2017 following equation is used for sensitivity analysis 6 p c i j g p z i j g p z i j z 100 here i represents factor number j depicts type of potential zone very poor poor moderate good and very good g p z i j indicates the j th type of gpz area excluding i th factor g p z i j denotes the j th type of gpz area considering all factors z is the total basin area and p c i j is used to indicate the percentage of change in gpz of the j th type omitting i th factor any simulation model is incomplete without its validation finally the kappa co efficient and overall accuracy assessment are computed to assess the level of accuracy and acceptance of the model a total number of 89 pre existing dug wells are taken randomly across the basin to collect groundwater level data of the pre monsoon for the month of april 2019 to validate with the prepared gpz map 4 results and discussion 4 1 geology the upper kangsabati river basin is situated over the cratonic part of west bengal and jharkhand sharma 2009 the basin area is consisted of different rock types of various geological ages ranging from proterozoic to quaternary sen et al 1998 geological survey of india 2001 most of the basin area is covered with granitic gneiss 53 18 followed by micha schist 33 83 and hornblende schist 11 78 of cggc table 3 distribution of clay with caliche concretion which is the only quaternary unconsolidated sedimentary deposition is found in a few pockets over the basin area this quaternary deposition is considered to be more favourable in the groundwater development followed by the weathered and fractured granitic gneiss and micha schist guru et al 2017 gnanachandrasamy et al 2018 specific yield of granitic gneiss and micha schist is found to be almost same and these rocks yield more groundwater compared to the other hard rocks in the area gec 2015 2017 in general the river basin can be divided into two based on dominance of major rock groups the upper portion of the basin is mainly comprised of granitic gneiss while the lower portion is highly dominated by the micha schist fig 4 this type of hard rocks holds moderate to high groundwater in aquifers mainly with the help of secondary porosity gec 2015 2017 4 2 lineament density any discontinuity over the rock surface in the forms of joints fractures faults share zones and rock cleavages is known as lineaments singhal and gupta 2010 ghosh et al 2020 these geomorphological features most of the time resulting from tectonic deformation of rocks are seen over or beneath the earth surface o leary et al 1976 ghosh et al 2020 the cgwb 2017 already mentions that the shallow aquifers of this study region have huge importance in producing groundwater the higher lineament density in an area ultimately represents higher groundwater potentiality haridas et al 1998 because lineaments are the source of secondary porosity abdullah et al 2009 fagbohun 2018 so there is a positive relation between lineament density and groundwater potentiality more than 54 of the study area enjoys high lineament density while a significant portion of 16 81 of area distributed along the southern part of the study area experiences low lineament density table 3 the central part of the basin is observed more suitable for groundwater exploration due to availability of high lineament density fig 5 4 3 slope slope is an important factor in the process of groundwater development the topographical variation of elevation is known as slope yeh et al 2016 siva et al 2017 the rate of percolation and infiltration of water into the ground is highly determined by amount of slope the high degree of slope of topography will definitely discourage the groundwater recharge thus an inverse relation exists between degree of slope and water percolation jaiswal et al 2003 shankar and mohan 2006 an area of 65 30 of the river basin comes under the less than 3 degree of topographical slope table 3 basically this proportion of the basin area will have the more probability in availability of groundwater the higher amount of slope of more than 7 covering an area of 2 87 is observed along the southern margin of the basin due to presence of residual hillocks namely kendapara pahar 22 50ʹ33 73ʹʹ n and 86 31ʹ28 71ʹʹ e udalbani dungri 22 49ʹ45 66ʹʹ n and 86 32ʹ42 65ʹʹ e mangala dungri 22 51ʹ24 81ʹʹ n and 86 29ʹ11 10ʹʹ e jharnakocha 23 0ʹ39 04ʹʹ n and 86 28ʹ08 25ʹʹ e karalikol 22 04ʹ32 20ʹʹ n and 86 37ʹ33 79ʹʹ e etc higher concentration of moderate type of slope is more prominent in the middle and southern sections of the basin fig 6 4 4 drainage density the total length of rivers in a unit of area is termed as drainage density horton 1932 it also shows the closeness of stream spacing kale and gupta 2001 and drainage density is mainly determined by lithology slope rainfall soil and vegetation of an area prabhakaran and jawahar raj 2018 a spatial unit with high degree of drainage density many a time experiences impermeable lithology strahler 1956 huggett 2007 steep slope huggett 2007 patra et al 2018 sparse vegetation chorley 1957 resmi et al 2019 and high runoff morisawa 1962 huggett 2007 most of the basin area 68 98 experiences moderate to high drainage density table 3 the highest drainage density areas appear in four distinct places over the map either circular or elliptical shapes due to high variation in degree of slope fig 7 around 31 of the basin area enjoys low to very low drainage density which is considered to be more suitable to have good potentiality of groundwater table 3 4 5 rainfall rainfall is the prime source to recharge aquifers in the study area the rate of rainfall determines amount of percolation of water into the ground patra et al 2018 the rainfall of the area is mainly influenced by the south west monsoon and occurs during july to september maity and mandal 2019 ghosh 2019 the high intensity rainfall for short duration is common here which restricts high rate of rain water infiltration into the ground due to rolling topography government of west bengal 2017 das et al 2019 the entire upper kangsabati river basin does not receive uniform pattern of rainfall the higher amount of rainfall is enjoyed by different pockets of the basin area such as north west south east and east in contrast the lowest amount of rainfall is experienced in circular pockets of middle and north east areas of the basin fig 8 this heterogeneity in terms of rainfall across the basin is mainly for the areal vastness of the study of interest though only an amount of 6 54 of the basin area receives rainfall in between 1100 mm and 1207 mm table 3 4 6 soil the movement of groundwater in the unsaturated zone is largely controlled by soil kumar et al 2020 the texture structure and pore space of soil determine the permeability ghosh et al 2020 and rate of groundwater recharge depends on the infiltration capacity of water into the soil arulbalaji et al 2019 ghosh et al 2020 the study area is mainly dominated by the sandy loam soil followed by skeletal soil sandy clay loam and coarse sandy loam table 3 the permeability of the coarse sandy loam is highest followed by skeletal soil sandy loam and sandy clay loam government of india 2020 the southern portion is covered by sandy clay loam while the almost north and east portions are dominated by sandy loam in contrast the skeletal soil is mainly observed in western side of the basin and three patches of coarse sandy loam are seen in north and east directions fig 9 4 7 land use land cover the land use land cover also influences soil moisture water infiltration surface water runoff etc which play determinant roles arulbalaji et al 2019 with growing vegetations during the rainy season the changing land use land cover greatly influences the runoff rate das et al 2017 most of the basin area is used for agricultural practices with a share of 52 22 of agricultural land total forest area including both shallow and dense forests is 26 66 while land without scrub is observed to be 8 28 only 2 81 of the basin is used for built up area table 3 the biggest water body is clearly seen in the form of reservoir mainly in south east direction of the basin fig 10 4 8 groundwater potential zones the integration of rs and gis techniques with ahp model helps to produce groundwater prospect zones map as a final result for the upper kangsabati river basin based on the dimensionless gpzi values the potentiality of groundwater of the studied region is found to be good to very good with 53 33 of area the high groundwater potentiality is mainly concentrated on the upper part of the basin due to high lineament density high rainfall low drainage density gentle slope and coarse sandy loam and skeletal soils only 17 44 of area of the whole basin is expected to have very poor to poor groundwater prospect zones around 30 of the basin area bears moderate type of possibility of groundwater prospect table 4 the southern part of the basin possesses poor chances of groundwater availability fig 11 4 9 validation of groundwater potential zones map the probability to have groundwater depending on the map of gpz will only be possible if the map is validated with the data of ground level reference points ghosh et al 2020 here an accuracy assessment is required to perform for assessing the validity of the developed model to do the same a total number of 89 dug wells data of groundwater level are collected across the basin the groundwater level in these dug wells varies from 1 mbgl to 12 9 mbgl which is classified into five distinct classes such as very good 4 5 mbgl good 4 5 mbgl to 5 5 mbgl moderate 5 5 mbgl to 6 3 mbgl poor 6 3 mbgl to 7 9 mbgl and very poor 7 9 mbgl to 12 9 mbgl using natural break classify system of arcgis software the overall accuracy assessment level is computed as 79 77 which justifies the validity of the model here the kappa co efficient is also calculated to perceive the agreement level between calculated value of gpz adopting different hydro geological factors and ground level reference points nasir et al 2018 ghosh et al 2020 the value of the kappa co efficient lies in between 0 and 1 in general the perfect agreement and the less than chance of agreement are represented by 1 and 0 respectively viera and garrett 2005 ghosh et al 2020 in the present study the calculated value of the kappa co efficient is 0 73 which refers that a substantial agreement is found in between the computed and reference points 4 10 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is used to understand the contribution of an individual factor in occurrence of groundwater and also helps to chalk out the percentage of area changes for a category patra et al 2018 kumar et al 2020 the removal of a relevant thematic layer or factor during the operation of the sensitivity analysis certainly influences the results of the final output of the study table 5 the negative and positive values of table 5 represent a decrease and an increase in area of different categories respectively the exclusion of slope increases 9 39 and 6 06 area of very poor and poor categories of gpz respectively in contrast the reduction of geology land use land cover drainage density soil and rainfall enhances area of 3 99 for good 5 07 for moderate 7 04 for good 7 59 for poor and 6 85 for very good respectively the exclusion of lineament density land use land cover and rainfall reduces area of 2 23 for moderate 7 64 for very good and 2 90 for poor categories respectively the elimination of slope may reduce an area of 15 45 from moderate to very good categories while drainage density and soil reduce 8 03 and 8 19 area in total for different categories respectively 5 conclusion to overcome the limitations of geo physical investigation of gpz the application of rs and gis has eased the process of assessment by simplifying it the upper kangsabati river basin enjoys an area of 1819 45 km2 53 33 with good to very good prospect of groundwater followed by moderate prospect area of 1000 69 km2 29 33 only an area of 591 23 km2 17 34 bears very poor to poor groundwater potentiality it is unveiled from the sensitivity analysis that the factor slope influences most the occurrence of groundwater followed by land use land cover soil drainage density and rainfall the result of the overall accuracy assessment of the study comes up with a value of 79 77 which upholds the validity of the study the population density of 1478 villages of the basin area is 415 km2 while it is 382 km2 for india in 2011 census of india 2011 thus the population pressure of the area is also high a large number of populations of the study area mainly rely on river water due to unsuccessful borehole drillings but unfortunately the non perennial nature of rivers of the kangsabati river basin cannot supply water to the inhabitants during summer times this situation can only be changed if the identified zones of good groundwater prospects are explored scientifically this study also opens new ways of investigations related to groundwater storage nature of aquifers rate of recharge water quality groundwater table etc the present work may be found useful by the policy makers to identify suitable sites for artificial recharge and management of groundwater resource for sustainable use declaration of
