6270,a smart decision making framework for stormwater management systems is designed through predictive real time control rtc of the outlet gate of a stormwater basin the proposed framework offers a cost effective non structural solution for dynamically controlling stormwater basins through manipulating the outlet gate and providing optimized outflow set points an integrated rtc optimization and rule based approach is designed to mitigate the impact of the discharged runoff on the receiving watercourse both in terms of quantity and quality in this approach the optimization part provides the optimized outflow set points for the basin to minimize peak flows during the wet periods while the rule based part controls the quality of the discharged water through sedimentation by increasing the detention time various rainfall data series are used as inputs for a case study stormwater basin to verify the performance of the proposed methodology the efficiency of the stormwater basin in reducing peak flows and improving the quality of outflow was estimated by comparing respectively the peak flows and detention times of the integrated rtc strategy with those of a static approach the results showed an improved quantity and quality control performance for the studied stormwater basin in comparison to the static control approach both in current climate conditions with a peak flow reduction from 73 to 95 and detention times varying from 16 to 30 h and in future climate conditions with an averagely reduction of 76 in peak flows and an average detention time of 19 h keywords real

the impervious surfaces which increases the amount of urban stormwater runoff in terms of volume and peak flows this increased amount of runoff not only discharges significant pollutant loads annually into streams brombach et al 2005 but it is the primary cause of urban flooding water body erosion sharp peak flows and hydraulic shocks on the receiving streams jacopin et al 2001 middleton and barrett 2008 muschalla et al 2014 on the other hand climate change causes significant changes in rainfall patterns guhathakurta et al 2011 it has been shown that in several regions of the world the extreme rain events are becoming more frequent due to cc mailhot et al 2007 miao et al 2019 westra et al 2013 and that these events will become even more frequent in the future according to the generated projections dale et al 2015 giorgi et al 2019 one of the important consequences of this changing climate lies in quicker and more severe urban runoff which results in further flooding and high peak flows to the hydraulic system of nearby watercourses semadeni davies et al 2008 sustainable stormwater management seeks the restoration of the natural hydrological cycle of groundwater and of the aquatic systems in urban and rural areas to this aim stormwater management infrastructure needs to be installed to tackle with stormwater key concerns in the most cost effective way first to mitigate the impacts of urbanization on the natural hydrologic cycle and on water quality then to adapt to the changing environmental conditions caused among others by climate change the combined impact of urbanization and climate change sometimes makes the conventional systems inefficient and calls for enhanced operational control systems astaraie imani et al 2012 when statically controlled as is most often the case the traditional stormwater management infrastructure does not operate optimally and can be in some cases not adaptable to changing conditions caused by climate change or urban development recent technologies make stormwater management systems adaptable to upcoming situations in these approaches despite conventional controls real time hydrologic states and rainfall predictions can dictate to the system how to modulate the outflow rates of stormwater management infrastructure marsalek 2005 wong and kerkez 2018 employing real time control rtc strategies for this infrastructure brings flexibility to the urban stormwater management systems a dynamically managed system that considers predicted data besides actual and historical data is able to adapt itself to variations in environmental conditions there are only a few cities in the world such as vienna austria quebec canada paris france bordeaux france and detroit us that have equipped their urban drainage networks with rtc systems these municipalities mostly employed rtc systems on their combined sewer networks to minimize the combined sewer overflow volumes while less attention has been devoted to the rtc of separate sewer systems therefore the potential for adaptive and sustainable management of urban stormwater in presence of global challenges like climate change has not been yet completely exploited shishegar et al 2018 advances in technology and automatic systems have led to the development and implementation of smart stormwater systems which perform computerized control to continuously modify themselves to adapt to changing inputs kerkez et al 2016 in this regard sustainability as one of the key elements of smart cities can be realized by equipping stormwater management infrastructures with rtc strategies kerkez et al 2016 suggest retrofitting stormwater infrastructures with sensors and digital control systems to tackle with varying meteorological conditions and runoff dynamics in a recent study by wong and kerkez 2018 using internet connected sensors on an urban watershed a control algorithm was developed to manage the operation of valves and gates at the catchment scale in another study kerkez et al 2016 proposed connectivity and intelligence as two key factors of adaptive control of stormwater management systems in order to exploit the potential of these systems for sustainable and adaptive management of urban stormwater optimization algorithms are introduced as strong tools in shishegar et al 2018 these algorithms have been employed in different stormwater studies like water pollutant reduction middleton and barrett 2008 optimal design of location and size of stormwater management systems yeh and labadie 1997 flood prevention verworn 2005 detention basin design mobley et al 2014 and many other problems although most of the literature on stormwater management systems optimization relies on static control approaches systems controlled by rtc optimization strategies is an area of growing interest in earlier rtc optimization of water system studies the application of model predictive control mpc to prevent flooding in downstream areas was investigated in which the use of optimization algorithms for dynamic control of urban drainage systems has been promoted niewiadomska szynkiewicz et al 1996 de keyser et al 1988 in further stages other objectives have been added such as minimization of combined sewer overflows duchesne et al 2004 maximization of the pollutant load reduction hoppe et al 2011 and also performance optimization of the regulating devices installed in water systems pleau et al 2005 although the application of optimization methods on stormwater studies seems vast there is still a lack of a universally integrated system for stormwater management structures at the operational level that performs optimally under varying environmental conditions e g urbanization extreme storm events runoff dynamics etc stormwater basins are among the stormwater management structures that can be controlled in real time to exploit their potential for adaptive and sustainable management of urban stormwater the rtc optimization of stormwater basins from the operational level perspective is still an emerging area of interest and most of the existing literature on optimization of stormwater management systems have addressed these systems only from the design level perspective shishegar et al 2018 a few research efforts have been directed towards the development of stormwater basins rtc strategies but they are mostly rule based methods like the ones in gaborit et al 2012 or in bilodeau et al 2019 where several control rules have been developed for real time control of the outflow rate of stormwater basins this has been realized by manipulating the outlet valve of dry detention ponds based on several automatic reactive rtc scenarios identified by customized thresholds although the corresponding results showed improved pollution load volume removal efficiency from 46 to 90 in gaborit et al 2012 the proposed scenarios are not necessarily optimal and are applicable only on the studied basin in another study by jacopin et al 2001 some on off regulations were designed to develop operational management practices for stormwater detention basins these operational local reactive control rules depend on local hydraulic conditions to control flows during heavy storm events and pollutants sedimentation during smaller more frequent events generally adding control rules to the outlet of stormwater basins brings the ability to adapt to weather conditions however integrating optimization techniques into the definition of control set points provides even more dynamic solutions to stormwater management problems that are applicable to different types and sizes of problems according to all of the above rule based methods have been studied for improving the performance of stormwater basins and optimization methods have been applied only on a limited number of stormwater management problems such as best management practices placement flooding control and cost minimization the combination of these two approaches ruled based and optimization has not been fully studied in stormwater basins control hence the objectives of this study are to propose a predictive rtc control strategy for stormwater basins outflows aiming at minimizing peak flows and maximizing detention time in order to improve water quality evaluate the performance of the proposed rtc strategy on a case study stormwater basin assess the outcomes of integrating quality control rules to the quantity control optimization model for the studied stormwater system test the impacts of climate change on the rtc strategy s performance and carry out a comparative analysis to evaluate the results obtained with the dynamic integrated rtc approach versus those of a more traditional static approach the main novelty of this study is to consider predictive rtc of stormwater basins for optimizing both quality and quantity control performance using observed and predicted precipitation data this allows to not only manage the actual rain event but also to get prepared for the upcoming ones in addition the performance of the proposed hybrid optimization rule based approach will be examined in presence of climate change to provide an adaptive measure as an alternative to the construction of new infrastructure 2 methodology an integrated predictive rtc optimization rule based model was developed to optimize the performance of a smart stormwater management system in terms of water quantity and quality in this regard a rtc framework was designed to better implement the proposed approach illustrated in fig 1 this framework includes three different blocks which are the simulation block the optimization block and the rule based control block and a final step for the final generation of optimal outflows and performance evaluation the first block consists of two steps to compute the inflows to the basin as a function of observed and predicted rainfall data with a simulation hydrological hydraulic model for the work presented in this paper the stormwater management model swmm rossman and huber 2016 implemented in pcswmm 7 0 was used as the hydrological hydraulic model this type of model dynamically simulates stormwater runoff and flows in stormwater sewer networks from the specified rainfall series it requires i observed and or predicted rainfall data and ii characteristics of the studied watersheds and network components like slopes area imperviousness etc therefore in the first step of the simulation block the historical and predicted rainfall series are defined as input for the identified rain gauges across the network having all the data set the hydrological hydraulic simulation model is run during the second step to compute the inflow hydrographs of the basin over the considered planning horizon the length of time that decision maker plans ahead in the rolling horizon approach see section 2 4 this hydrograph is then used as an input parameter fig 2 for the optimization model in the optimization block the optimization block starts with running the designed optimization algorithm for the rtc of the stormwater system outflows in step 3 to do so the objective function minimizes the outflows from the basin to the receiving watercourse during the control horizon with respect to several physical and hydrological constraints such as the basins capacity constraint the mass balance constraint the maximum allowable outflow constraints and some others that all are formulated below during wet periods as long as there is an inflow the optimization model is active to generate outflow set points for the system as a result the flows discharged to the river are determined while running the integrated rtc strategies which is engaged in this step 4 in a rolling horizon loop this loop is responsible for creating a dynamic scheduling for the future outflows based on the predicted and actual received data and in collaboration with the simulation model whereas during dry periods quality control rules that are formulated in the rule based control block are activated these rules perform in such a way that the settling process of the retained water is satisfied by maximising the detention time in the basin up to a target value while ensuring that the available volume in the basin is sufficient for the next upcoming storm event without any basin overflow given the predictive nature of the rtc strategies the optimization algorithm combined with the quality detention control rules define the outflow planning based on both the observed and predicted states of the system indeed the decisions made about the outfall gate opening fig 3 take into account not only the actual inflow to the basin but also data from the future runoff dynamics based on short term weather forecasts the quantity control optimization model for the predictive real time control of stormwater basin outflows is developed in the following as a constrained linear programming problem in this model the outflow of the basin is the model decision variable the water volume in the basin is another variable of the problem whose possible values are all dependent to the outflow decision variable values afterward four different rules are developed based on the upcoming predicted rain event and the available storage volume in the basin 2 1 modeling principles the stormwater system studied in this research is a detention pond dry stormwater basin whose structure is shown in fig 3 a detention pond is a stormwater facility constructed in an open area impounded by an embankment at the outlet of the pond a structure can control the outflow rates to the receiving stream in the case studied here the control structure is a sluice gate which can be manipulated by a motor via an actuator when the gate is partially or fully closed the inflows i t entering through the inlet pipe are attenuated at the outlet thus reducing peak flows and promoting sedimentation of suspended solids ss which provides more moderate and cleaner outflows q t to the river indeed the temporary storage v t of stormwater runoff is trapped in the basin and released slowly to the downstream area based on the control policy defined for the basin fig 3 in this study the assumption is that the stormwater pond performs in such a way that the water is detained as long as possible maximum 40 h in the basin to allow sedimentation while avoiding overflow the emptying process of the basin can be started during at the end or even before the beginning of the storm event to make available the required storage volume for the next upcoming rainfall event while avoiding high outflows to the river open close sequences of the outlet gate are avoided to prevent the extra energy consumption and equipment depreciation the pond is drained as gently as possible to prevent any sharp peak flow to the downstream river a maximum allowable outflow from the basin is respected as defined by local regulations to mimic pre development flows e g 50 l s ha 2 2 optimization model formulation when there is inflow to the basin wet periods the outflows are determined by solving the following optimization problem where the objective function is objective function 1 m i n t q t ξ pp t φ qq t t 0 1 n where q t outflow decision variable from the basin at time step t m3 s pp t negative variation of the set point continuous variable qq t positive variation of the set point continuous variable ξ weight associated to the positive variation pp t φ weight associated with the negative variation qq t n number of time steps in the control horizon and there are seven constraints that have to be satisfied as listed below capacity constraint 2 t i t q t δ t v 0 v max where i t inflow to the basin at time step t m3 s v max maximum volume capacity of the basin m3 δ t difference of t between two time steps s v 0 the initial volume of water in the basin m3 mass balance constraint 3 q t δ t 2 v t i t δ t i t 1 δ t 2 v t 1 q t 1 δ t t 1 n volume positivity constraint 4 v t 0 t 0 1 n maximum allowable outflow constraint 5 0 q t q max t 0 1 n where q max maximum allowable outflow from the basin m3 s 5 flow variation constraints 6 q t q t 1 pp t qq t t 0 1 n 7 pp t 0 t 0 1 n 8 qq t 0 t 0 1 n with respect to eq 1 the main objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the total outflow discharged to the receiving stream during the control horizon also as it is desired to move the system regulators as less as possible the fluctuations of the outflow over the time horizon have to be minimized too the sum of pp t and qq t is minimized to this aim eq 2 ensures that the volume of the retained water does not exceed the maximum volume of the basin eq 3 is the mass balance constraint eq 4 is the positivity constraint of v t dependent variable since municipal regulations often take into account a maximum allowable stream flow to the rivers eq 5 represents this maximum outflow along with positivity constraint of q t decision variable eq 6 represents the variation penalty constraints applied to the outflow set points to prevent the extra movement of the outlet gate this formulation incudes the positive and negative variations of the outflow which have both strictly positive values as shown in eqs 7 and 8 2 3 quality control rules four generic rules are developed for controlling the settling process in the stormwater basin the advantage of these control rules lies in their generality which makes them applicable to different cases with different climate conditions and rainfall series unlike the existing strategies in the literature which mostly resulted from trial and error to come up with a threshold for the designed regulations bilodeau et al 2019 gaborit et al 2012 the proposed strategy in this study provides some generic formulations that consider the required storage volume for the upcoming runoff inflows resulting from future rainfall events through an integrated collaboration with the optimization algorithm presented above a minimum desired detention time of 20 h was selected based on the results presented in carpenter et al 2014 who showed that the suspended solids ss concentration decreased significantly in urban runoff water in the first 20 h of detention on the other hand after 40 h of detaining water in the basin almost no more settling process is realized as reported again in carpenter et al 2014 accordingly it is suggested to gently release the trapped runoff into the receiving watercourse after this time 40 h to restore the system s maximum storage capacity gaborit et al 2012 however as the first objective in this study is to generate low rate outflows it is sometimes desirable to detain water less than 40 h in order to provide enough time for water to discharge when some storage volume is required for the next upcoming rainfall event in all cases this is over the prediction horizon that the predicted data is provided for the system in order to anticipate the future required storage volume while the dynamic outflow scheduling is realized over the control horizon fig 4 all this process will be explained more in section 2 4 having all these in mind the desired detention time is combined with the emptying time of the basin and the characteristics of the next predicted rainfall event s to specify the emptying rule then the selected rule provides the outflow from the basin as a result of manipulating the opening of the outlet gate eqs 9 13 present the proposed rules 9 if t nextrain t e q t q max 10 if t e t nextrain t e 20 h q t q max t e t nextrain t f 11 if t e 20 h t nextrain 40 h t e max q t q max t e 20 h t nextrain t

outflow q max s v req required storage volume for the next coming rainfall event to avoid any overflow in the basin m3 it should be noted that in case of a dry period longer than 40 h t e max after the last rain event the water is retained 40 h in the basin eq 12 to realize the settling process and then released at a gentle outflow rate that allows keeping quiescent conditions in the basin during t e max this limits the emptying of the basin to a certain amount of time that fulfills significant reduction of ss concentration 90 and also avoids any mosquito breeding as justified in gaborit et al 2012 and carpenter et al 2014 2 4 real time control rolling horizon inspired by the rolling horizon decision making approach for model predictive control technology sethi and sorger 1991 a rolling horizon strategy is embedded to the optimization model to realize the rtc and execute the optimization simulation periodically this approach provides a dynamic scheduling based on the planning for few time steps ahead and then moving forward the time horizon at each step after receiving feedbacks from the system following the implementation of the previously determined set points the approach simulates the problem in a way that when real data become available the model updates the information and accordingly re plans for the next remaining time periods example of implementing this rolling horizon approach in the field of stormwater management can be found in duchesne et al 2004 the control horizon selected for the case study presented in this paper is 30 min in which the periods are divided in n 6 optimization time steps of 5 min each also a prediction horizon of 48 h is considered to provide the meteorological forecasting data of the next 48 h for the system as new rainfall data arrives the planning is then rolled over and the model s predictions and decisions are updated this concept is shown schematically in fig 5 using this strategy the real time scheduling of basin s outflow is implemented while considering dynamic meteorological conditions and dynamic runoff volumes 2 5 case study the studied case is a detention basin collecting stormwater from a watershed located in a canadian city this watershed is close to a river on its east side with its outlet to a small ditch which discharges finally to this river based on a master plan published by cogesaf 2010 several water related issues across the watershed have been identified among which the degraded quality of water and several flood episodes which affect the population of downstream areas furthermore according to ouranos 2015 this region will be affected by climate change through having more precipitation by 2050 more runoff flows as well as earlier and less predictable floods in addition in summer higher temperatures lower water levels and sudden severe storms are more probable in the future than now this makes this area an interesting case study benchmark for the proposed predictive rtc strategy where the hypothesis is that employing the proposed integrated rtc approach provides minimized elevated peak flows in the stream and enhanced pollutant sedimentation performance for the studied stormwater management system the studied stormwater detention basin is located in an urban area of the watershed that includes medium density residential and some commercial and institutional lots table 1 and fig 6 the swmm hydraulic model of the studied sector was provided by the city s municipality this model includes the stormwater sewer network of the studied catchment with 104 sub basins and a total area of 162 ha 204 pipe sections totaling more than 13 km pipe diameters ranging from 300 mm to 1800 mm and an overall impermeability of 37 the detention basin has a capacity of 61 495 m3 which allows the collection of runoff resulting from a 100 year return period rainfall event although the basin has a large capacity its outlet is not dynamically controlled so water rarely accumulates into it fig 6 presents the swmm model of the case study watershed there are several problems reported in this drainage network including an overload of the main collector to the detention pond and some parts of the pipes with low or zero slopes which cause additional local surcharges the network previously designed for a 10 year service level no longer meets this level of service due to urban development here are the assumptions of the problem for the case study presented in this paper the control horizon is finite with a value of 30 min while the planning horizon is infinite the prediction horizon is up to 48 h the physical characteristics of the basin are finite and known no evaporation is taken into account there is no infiltration in the basin the inflow to the basin is known obtained from the hydrological hydraulic simulation model zero volume of water in the basin at the start of the plan there is no inflow during dry periods the basin receives inflows during wet periods only perfect prediction data is used when running the integrated rtc algorithm 2 6 rain series characteristics the recorded 5 minute rainfall series observed at a rain gauge located 80 km from the studied watershed is used meteorological characteristics of this region are close to those of the studied case for this station rainfall data are available from may to november for years 2002 and 2005 to 2013 from this series rain events have been created based on two criteria for the purpose of characterizing rainfall series table 3 a minimum of 1 2 mm h of rain and a 6 h inter event duration the average amount of rainfall recorded by environment canada for this station between 2000 and 2017 for the period of may 1 to november 30 is 759 56 mm tables 2 and 3 represent the rainfall characteristics of the 2007 and 2013 rainfall series for a 6 hour inter event duration those two years were chosen because they represent respectively an average and a very rainy year validating the methodology employing the higher available rain volume data series 2013 provides a challenging situation for the studied system and allows to test the performance of the proposed strategy under critical meteorological conditions in addition climate change implication in the next 30 years until 2050 is considered by adding 15 to the actual rainfall series as proposed by ouranos 2015 the hyetographs of rainfall series related to years 2007 and 2013 are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 respectively 2 7 performance criteria different performance criteria are considered to quantify the integrated rtc strategy benefits in terms of peak discharge mitigation water quality improvement overflow prevention improved flow attenuation and outflow variation minimization which are illustrated in table 4 in order to assess the applicability of the proposed model in practice four different scenarios are presented scenario 1 a rainy year 2013 with the studied basin scenario 2 a normal year 2007 with the studied basin scenario 3 a smaller basin with a volume capacity of 20 498 m3 1 3 of the studied basin in a rainy year 2013 and finally scenario 4 the increased 2013 rainfall series to reproduce the effect of the expected climate change with the studied basin it should be noted that all these criteria are formulated for one single event to further evaluate the performance of the whole studied period by calculating their standard deviation also since the perfect forecasting data were used to calculate the predictive performance of the stormwater management basin all the values obtained for the performance criteria are the upper expected bounds these formulations and the presented integrated mathematical model are coded in matlab environment and runs using a desktop pc intel ci7 3 results and discussions in this section the validity of the proposed integrated rtc optimization rule based approach is discussed several storm events are extracted from the one year rainfall series to analyze the performance of the studied system in different meteorological conditions and considering climate change fig 9 represents the outflow schedule resulting from the integrated rtc strategy for the four defined scenarios and table 5 presents a summary of the performance criteria values as shown in fig 9 in all scenarios the stormwater basin experiences a delayed distributed and steady outflow however the results of scenarios 3 and 4 with a smaller basin and in presence of climate change respectively show higher outflow rates the results related to scenario 3 show that the integrated rtc strategy is affected by the volume capacity of the basin and the selected rainfall series nevertheless the dynamic strategy schedules the outflows in such a way that it retains runoff to allow ss sedimentation while attenuating outflows although in higher rates than in other scenarios an average 16 h detention time is reported table 5 for the 2013 series under scenario 3 that comes with an average 73 reduction in peak flows in comparison to the static approach which provides a significant improvement in both quality and quantity points of view similarly under scenario 4 and under climate change the proposed dynamic approach provides an overall 76 reduction in peak flow rates over the traditional static approach even though the integrated rtc strategy generates lower flow attenuation performance criteria higher outflow rates for scenarios 3 and 4 in comparison to scenarios 1 and 2 fig 9 and table 5 it provides a 64 reduction in overall flow rates compared to the static approach table 5 indicates that under different scenarios representing different basin characteristics and different meteorological conditions employing integrated rtc strategy results in a significant improvement in controlling peak flow rate of stormwater discharge in average 48 of the volume capacity of the basin is filled under climate change due to the higher volume of runoff entering the basin this value is 51 in scenario 3 where the capacity of the basin is low while for the less challenging scenarios 1 and 2 12 and 10 of the volume basin respectively are used in average also quality control criteria has been realized at an average of 30 h 23 h 16 h and 19 h under scenarios 1 4 respectively it means that under optimization strategy the system tends to keep water in the available storage while quality control regulations make the system generate delayed outflows to realize optimal detaining of water 3 1 examples of scenarios 1 3 actual meteorological conditions 3 1 1 scenario 1 2007 rainfall series as an average year fig 10 shows the performance of the integrated rtc strategy under the rain event occurring on 26 28 september 2007 versus the traditional static approach this period fig 10 starts with a high rain intensity where outflows from the basin to the receiving water course are high with the static approach while in the controlled approach the received runoff is kept into the basin to allow the settling process in this situation as there are two consecutive rain events predicted for the next 24 h the trapped water is released at a steady rate from 4 15 on september 27 to prevent any possible overflow accordingly the basin is emptied and then the outlet gate is closed at 7 55 on september 27 to detain newly arrived inflows the water volume in the basin continues to rise as far as prediction data storage capacity and control rules allow in all situations to avoid abrupt moves of the outlet gate the generated outflow set points are steady with minimal fluctuations as another example of the performance of the basin when controlled by the rtc approach fig 11 demonstrates the storm events of september 11 17 2007 unlike the static control method which generates the outflow based upon the received runoff without any adaptation the rtc outflow is scheduled in such a way that it always considers the forecasted precipitation an ability that helps the system to perform based on an optimized operational planning 3 1 2 scenario 2 2013 rainfall series as a rainy year fig 12 represents the hydrographs of the stormwater basin outflow when controlled using the integrated rtc strategy versus the static approach during four storm events recorded in may 2013 as it is shown unlike the static approach the rtc strategy detains water in the basin for 20 h after the first rain event to realize sedimentation and then release flows at a steady rate to get prepared for the next upcoming event during the second event which occurred on 21 may beginning at 7 05 the received runoff is trapped in the basin however the rtc strategy decides to open the outlet gate before 20 h of detention at a low steady rate 0 08 m3 s 0 49 l s ha although in this case the detention time is lower that the ideal 20 h it is possible that the 0 08 m3 s outflow rate would allow sedimentation by keeping quiescent conditions in the basin fig 13 illustrates the basin s hydrographs during a 5 day period in september 2013 sharp outflows are imposed to the body of water with the static control as a consequence of runoff inflows employing the integrated rtc strategy results in attenuated and uniform flows at the outfall whilst detaining water in the basin during the rain event of september 12 beginning at 19 35 the optimization model decides to release water to the river slowly as high inflows are predicted for the next hours henceforth right after the further rain event on september 13 all received runoff volume is detained water volume in the basin is 7500 m3 at this time to allow sedimentation and after almost 24 h the outlet opening is set to allow a delayed discharge 3 1 3 scenario 3 low volume basin with 2013 rainfall series to pose an additional challenge to the controlled system a smaller stormwater basin with a volume capacity of 20 498 m3 has been taken into account in such a situation sometimes the optimization model is not able to generate zero value outflows in order to keep the required available storage for the future incoming runoff flows as shown in fig 14 although the gate is partially open from may 24 to 26 the trapped water reaches its maximum volume in the basin this demonstrates the predictive performance of the rtc framework since it is able to anticipate the required volume of storage in near future here 24 h accordingly a 20 h detention time is obtained while providing gentle outflow of 0 36 m3 s which corresponds to 2 22 l s ha at the outfall from 13 05 may 27 to 12 15 may 28 3 2 scenario 4 climate change fig 15 shows the hydrographs of the studied stormwater basin with the modified 15 may 20 30 2013 data series in this case as the system receives high runoff inflows on may 23 the optimization model decides to open the outlet gate at a low percentage in wet period may 23 26 to prevent overflow of the basin while during the original rain event without cc the water is detained for a certain amount of time to allow the settling process it means that in critical situations the integrated rtc strategy prioritizes the quantity control measures avoiding overflow over the quality control ones retaining water looking at the water volume variation fig 15 it can be seen that the storage capacity of the basin reaches its maximum in this case although detaining water in the basin could result in improving the quality of discharged water it could also result in system overflow and even elevated peak flows to the receiving stream hence the designed algorithm performs in a way that besides providing peak flow reduction it generates optimized detention times except when there is a risk of capacity exceedance the efficiency of the system in mitigating the peak flows for the illustrated period in fig 15 is calculated as 78 4 conclusion this study proposed an integrated predictive rtc optimization rule based approach for adaptive and sustainable management of urban stormwater the main threefold contributions that differentiate this study from previous relevant work are summarized as below a predictive rtc optimization model is developed to minimize the peak flows imposed to the receiving watercourse in the downstream area via generating the outflow set points at predefined time steps this optimization model is implemented periodically on a rolling horizon basis four generalized quality control rules are designed considering the next upcoming storm event and the volume of trapped water in the basin unlike the existing control rules in the related state of the art these rules are applicable to all stormwater detention basins the decision level combination of quantity control optimization model and quality control rules provides an integrated approach for rtc of stormwater basin in a dynamic environment whose state is varying from wet to dry or dry to wet period continuously the designed integrated rtc strategy has the potential for optimizing the performance of stormwater management systems facing challenges like urbanization and climate change the dynamic scheduling of the outflows at the outlet of the studied separate sewer network of a city in canada highlights the importance of employing smart approaches on traditional systems in order to enable them to perform in an adaptive and predictive way this predictive nature of the presented rtc approach allows optimizing the outflow rates while generating desired possible detention times for the stormwater management system to improve water quality and preventing overflow of the basin according to the results the hydraulic stress on receiving water body was controlled by reducing peak flows up to 95 although lower values have been reported in more challenging situations like with a lower volume basin or with increased rainfall intensities due to climate change noteworthy is that in all situations the peak flow reduction was at least 73 while preventing any overflow moreover the average detention time of the basin was realized under normal to challenging situations for different scenarios from 16 h to 30 h in comparison to the static approach where in practice there is not any detention time although these two factors were the most important performance criteria when optimizing the problem along with overflow prevention other benefits were identified and quantified when analyzing the final scheduled flows at the outlet of the basin namely flow attenuation and reduced outflow variations although due the perfect prediction data all values obtained for the performance criteria are the upper bounds of the system this provides strong implications for municipal decision makers to computerize the traditional stormwater management systems and exploit their full potential when facing varying environmental conditions the key results of this study lead us to the following conclusions smart control algorithms are enabling stormwater management systems to significantly improve the quality and quantity control performance in presence of climate change the environmental risk can be managed by employing dynamic adaptation measures as an economic and efficient solution transforming sharp fluctuated flows to steady distributed delayed and attenuated outflows is the key indication of the optimized performance of integrated rtc strategy the safety of stormwater basin can be preserved with the proposed algorithm even in case of a low volume capacity basin with the aid of alternative control measures that equilibrate quality and quantity objectives there are several research directions that can be further continued based on this study even though considering control measures at the local scale resulted in optimal performance for that stormwater system it does not guarantee the optimal performance when considering downstream areas globally accordingly the actual framework can be extended to the watershed scale in order to provide a global adaptive measure for the stormwater management systems in this case the complexity of the problem is inevitable for which developing meta heuristic algorithms and incorporating artificial intelligence approaches are recommended additionally in a few time periods the volume stored in the basin reached its maximum capacity this may put the basin at risk of overflow a fact that can be better managed by considering longer term prediction data and or by defining flexible priority coefficients for the quality and quantity objectives finally it is important to consider the uncertainties engaged into the problem in order to produce more reliable solutions here meteorological forecasting error is one of the main sources of uncertainties for which stochastic analysis can provide the best optimal solution also a robust plan can be taken into account as an efficient approach in even the worst case scenarios one should notice that this robustness in the solution may come with excessive costs in all cases a reliable adaptive and sustainable management solution for urban stormwater systems is desirable funding this

6270,a smart decision making framework for stormwater management systems is designed through predictive real time control rtc of the outlet gate of a stormwater basin the proposed framework offers a cost effective non structural solution for dynamically controlling stormwater basins through manipulating the outlet gate and providing optimized outflow set points an integrated rtc optimization and rule based approach is designed to mitigate the impact of the discharged runoff on the receiving watercourse both in terms of quantity and quality in this approach the optimization part provides the optimized outflow set points for the basin to minimize peak flows during the wet periods while the rule based part controls the quality of the discharged water through sedimentation by increasing the detention time various rainfall data series are used as inputs for a case study stormwater basin to verify the performance of the proposed methodology the efficiency of the stormwater basin in reducing peak flows and improving the quality of outflow was estimated by comparing respectively the peak flows and detention times of the integrated rtc strategy with those of a static approach the results showed an improved quantity and quality control performance for the studied stormwater basin in comparison to the static control approach both in current climate conditions with a peak flow reduction from 73 to 95 and detention times varying from 16 to 30 h and in future climate conditions with an averagely reduction of 76 in peak flows and an average detention time of 19 h keywords real

the impervious surfaces which increases the amount of urban stormwater runoff in terms of volume and peak flows this increased amount of runoff not only discharges significant pollutant loads annually into streams brombach et al 2005 but it is the primary cause of urban flooding water body erosion sharp peak flows and hydraulic shocks on the receiving streams jacopin et al 2001 middleton and barrett 2008 muschalla et al 2014 on the other hand climate change causes significant changes in rainfall patterns guhathakurta et al 2011 it has been shown that in several regions of the world the extreme rain events are becoming more frequent due to cc mailhot et al 2007 miao et al 2019 westra et al 2013 and that these events will become even more frequent in the future according to the generated projections dale et al 2015 giorgi et al 2019 one of the important consequences of this changing climate lies in quicker and more severe urban runoff which results in further flooding and high peak flows to the hydraulic system of nearby watercourses semadeni davies et al 2008 sustainable stormwater management seeks the restoration of the natural hydrological cycle of groundwater and of the aquatic systems in urban and rural areas to this aim stormwater management infrastructure needs to be installed to tackle with stormwater key concerns in the most cost effective way first to mitigate the impacts of urbanization on the natural hydrologic cycle and on water quality then to adapt to the changing environmental conditions caused among others by climate change the combined impact of urbanization and climate change sometimes makes the conventional systems inefficient and calls for enhanced operational control systems astaraie imani et al 2012 when statically controlled as is most often the case the traditional stormwater management infrastructure does not operate optimally and can be in some cases not adaptable to changing conditions caused by climate change or urban development recent technologies make stormwater management systems adaptable to upcoming situations in these approaches despite conventional controls real time hydrologic states and rainfall predictions can dictate to the system how to modulate the outflow rates of stormwater management infrastructure marsalek 2005 wong and kerkez 2018 employing real time control rtc strategies for this infrastructure brings flexibility to the urban stormwater management systems a dynamically managed system that considers predicted data besides actual and historical data is able to adapt itself to variations in environmental conditions there are only a few cities in the world such as vienna austria quebec canada paris france bordeaux france and detroit us that have equipped their urban drainage networks with rtc systems these municipalities mostly employed rtc systems on their combined sewer networks to minimize the combined sewer overflow volumes while less attention has been devoted to the rtc of separate sewer systems therefore the potential for adaptive and sustainable management of urban stormwater in presence of global challenges like climate change has not been yet completely exploited shishegar et al 2018 advances in technology and automatic systems have led to the development and implementation of smart stormwater systems which perform computerized control to continuously modify themselves to adapt to changing inputs kerkez et al 2016 in this regard sustainability as one of the key elements of smart cities can be realized by equipping stormwater management infrastructures with rtc strategies kerkez et al 2016 suggest retrofitting stormwater infrastructures with sensors and digital control systems to tackle with varying meteorological conditions and runoff dynamics in a recent study by wong and kerkez 2018 using internet connected sensors on an urban watershed a control algorithm was developed to manage the operation of valves and gates at the catchment scale in another study kerkez et al 2016 proposed connectivity and intelligence as two key factors of adaptive control of stormwater management systems in order to exploit the potential of these systems for sustainable and adaptive management of urban stormwater optimization algorithms are introduced as strong tools in shishegar et al 2018 these algorithms have been employed in different stormwater studies like water pollutant reduction middleton and barrett 2008 optimal design of location and size of stormwater management systems yeh and labadie 1997 flood prevention verworn 2005 detention basin design mobley et al 2014 and many other problems although most of the literature on stormwater management systems optimization relies on static control approaches systems controlled by rtc optimization strategies is an area of growing interest in earlier rtc optimization of water system studies the application of model predictive control mpc to prevent flooding in downstream areas was investigated in which the use of optimization algorithms for dynamic control of urban drainage systems has been promoted niewiadomska szynkiewicz et al 1996 de keyser et al 1988 in further stages other objectives have been added such as minimization of combined sewer overflows duchesne et al 2004 maximization of the pollutant load reduction hoppe et al 2011 and also performance optimization of the regulating devices installed in water systems pleau et al 2005 although the application of optimization methods on stormwater studies seems vast there is still a lack of a universally integrated system for stormwater management structures at the operational level that performs optimally under varying environmental conditions e g urbanization extreme storm events runoff dynamics etc stormwater basins are among the stormwater management structures that can be controlled in real time to exploit their potential for adaptive and sustainable management of urban stormwater the rtc optimization of stormwater basins from the operational level perspective is still an emerging area of interest and most of the existing literature on optimization of stormwater management systems have addressed these systems only from the design level perspective shishegar et al 2018 a few research efforts have been directed towards the development of stormwater basins rtc strategies but they are mostly rule based methods like the ones in gaborit et al 2012 or in bilodeau et al 2019 where several control rules have been developed for real time control of the outflow rate of stormwater basins this has been realized by manipulating the outlet valve of dry detention ponds based on several automatic reactive rtc scenarios identified by customized thresholds although the corresponding results showed improved pollution load volume removal efficiency from 46 to 90 in gaborit et al 2012 the proposed scenarios are not necessarily optimal and are applicable only on the studied basin in another study by jacopin et al 2001 some on off regulations were designed to develop operational management practices for stormwater detention basins these operational local reactive control rules depend on local hydraulic conditions to control flows during heavy storm events and pollutants sedimentation during smaller more frequent events generally adding control rules to the outlet of stormwater basins brings the ability to adapt to weather conditions however integrating optimization techniques into the definition of control set points provides even more dynamic solutions to stormwater management problems that are applicable to different types and sizes of problems according to all of the above rule based methods have been studied for improving the performance of stormwater basins and optimization methods have been applied only on a limited number of stormwater management problems such as best management practices placement flooding control and cost minimization the combination of these two approaches ruled based and optimization has not been fully studied in stormwater basins control hence the objectives of this study are to propose a predictive rtc control strategy for stormwater basins outflows aiming at minimizing peak flows and maximizing detention time in order to improve water quality evaluate the performance of the proposed rtc strategy on a case study stormwater basin assess the outcomes of integrating quality control rules to the quantity control optimization model for the studied stormwater system test the impacts of climate change on the rtc strategy s performance and carry out a comparative analysis to evaluate the results obtained with the dynamic integrated rtc approach versus those of a more traditional static approach the main novelty of this study is to consider predictive rtc of stormwater basins for optimizing both quality and quantity control performance using observed and predicted precipitation data this allows to not only manage the actual rain event but also to get prepared for the upcoming ones in addition the performance of the proposed hybrid optimization rule based approach will be examined in presence of climate change to provide an adaptive measure as an alternative to the construction of new infrastructure 2 methodology an integrated predictive rtc optimization rule based model was developed to optimize the performance of a smart stormwater management system in terms of water quantity and quality in this regard a rtc framework was designed to better implement the proposed approach illustrated in fig 1 this framework includes three different blocks which are the simulation block the optimization block and the rule based control block and a final step for the final generation of optimal outflows and performance evaluation the first block consists of two steps to compute the inflows to the basin as a function of observed and predicted rainfall data with a simulation hydrological hydraulic model for the work presented in this paper the stormwater management model swmm rossman and huber 2016 implemented in pcswmm 7 0 was used as the hydrological hydraulic model this type of model dynamically simulates stormwater runoff and flows in stormwater sewer networks from the specified rainfall series it requires i observed and or predicted rainfall data and ii characteristics of the studied watersheds and network components like slopes area imperviousness etc therefore in the first step of the simulation block the historical and predicted rainfall series are defined as input for the identified rain gauges across the network having all the data set the hydrological hydraulic simulation model is run during the second step to compute the inflow hydrographs of the basin over the considered planning horizon the length of time that decision maker plans ahead in the rolling horizon approach see section 2 4 this hydrograph is then used as an input parameter fig 2 for the optimization model in the optimization block the optimization block starts with running the designed optimization algorithm for the rtc of the stormwater system outflows in step 3 to do so the objective function minimizes the outflows from the basin to the receiving watercourse during the control horizon with respect to several physical and hydrological constraints such as the basins capacity constraint the mass balance constraint the maximum allowable outflow constraints and some others that all are formulated below during wet periods as long as there is an inflow the optimization model is active to generate outflow set points for the system as a result the flows discharged to the river are determined while running the integrated rtc strategies which is engaged in this step 4 in a rolling horizon loop this loop is responsible for creating a dynamic scheduling for the future outflows based on the predicted and actual received data and in collaboration with the simulation model whereas during dry periods quality control rules that are formulated in the rule based control block are activated these rules perform in such a way that the settling process of the retained water is satisfied by maximising the detention time in the basin up to a target value while ensuring that the available volume in the basin is sufficient for the next upcoming storm event without any basin overflow given the predictive nature of the rtc strategies the optimization algorithm combined with the quality detention control rules define the outflow planning based on both the observed and predicted states of the system indeed the decisions made about the outfall gate opening fig 3 take into account not only the actual inflow to the basin but also data from the future runoff dynamics based on short term weather forecasts the quantity control optimization model for the predictive real time control of stormwater basin outflows is developed in the following as a constrained linear programming problem in this model the outflow of the basin is the model decision variable the water volume in the basin is another variable of the problem whose possible values are all dependent to the outflow decision variable values afterward four different rules are developed based on the upcoming predicted rain event and the available storage volume in the basin 2 1 modeling principles the stormwater system studied in this research is a detention pond dry stormwater basin whose structure is shown in fig 3 a detention pond is a stormwater facility constructed in an open area impounded by an embankment at the outlet of the pond a structure can control the outflow rates to the receiving stream in the case studied here the control structure is a sluice gate which can be manipulated by a motor via an actuator when the gate is partially or fully closed the inflows i t entering through the inlet pipe are attenuated at the outlet thus reducing peak flows and promoting sedimentation of suspended solids ss which provides more moderate and cleaner outflows q t to the river indeed the temporary storage v t of stormwater runoff is trapped in the basin and released slowly to the downstream area based on the control policy defined for the basin fig 3 in this study the assumption is that the stormwater pond performs in such a way that the water is detained as long as possible maximum 40 h in the basin to allow sedimentation while avoiding overflow the emptying process of the basin can be started during at the end or even before the beginning of the storm event to make available the required storage volume for the next upcoming rainfall event while avoiding high outflows to the river open close sequences of the outlet gate are avoided to prevent the extra energy consumption and equipment depreciation the pond is drained as gently as possible to prevent any sharp peak flow to the downstream river a maximum allowable outflow from the basin is respected as defined by local regulations to mimic pre development flows e g 50 l s ha 2 2 optimization model formulation when there is inflow to the basin wet periods the outflows are determined by solving the following optimization problem where the objective function is objective function 1 m i n t q t ξ pp t φ qq t t 0 1 n where q t outflow decision variable from the basin at time step t m3 s pp t negative variation of the set point continuous variable qq t positive variation of the set point continuous variable ξ weight associated to the positive variation pp t φ weight associated with the negative variation qq t n number of time steps in the control horizon and there are seven constraints that have to be satisfied as listed below capacity constraint 2 t i t q t δ t v 0 v max where i t inflow to the basin at time step t m3 s v max maximum volume capacity of the basin m3 δ t difference of t between two time steps s v 0 the initial volume of water in the basin m3 mass balance constraint 3 q t δ t 2 v t i t δ t i t 1 δ t 2 v t 1 q t 1 δ t t 1 n volume positivity constraint 4 v t 0 t 0 1 n maximum allowable outflow

eq 1 the main objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the total outflow discharged to the receiving stream during the control horizon also as it is desired to move the system regulators as less as possible the fluctuations of the outflow over the time horizon have to be minimized too the sum of pp t and qq t is minimized to this aim eq 2 ensures that the volume of the retained water does not exceed the maximum volume of the basin eq 3 is the mass balance constraint eq 4 is the positivity constraint of v t dependent variable since municipal regulations often take into account a maximum allowable stream flow to the rivers eq 5 represents this maximum outflow along with positivity constraint of q t decision variable eq 6 represents the variation penalty constraints applied to the outflow set points to prevent the extra movement of the outlet gate this formulation incudes the positive and negative variations of the outflow which have both strictly positive values as shown in eqs 7 and 8 2 3 quality control rules four generic rules are developed for controlling the settling process in the stormwater basin the advantage of these control rules lies in their generality which makes them applicable to different cases with different climate conditions and rainfall series unlike the existing strategies in the literature which mostly resulted from trial and error to come up with a threshold for the designed regulations bilodeau et al 2019 gaborit et al 2012 the proposed strategy in this study provides some generic formulations that consider the required storage volume for the upcoming runoff inflows resulting from future rainfall events through an integrated collaboration with the optimization algorithm presented above a minimum desired detention time of 20 h was selected based on the results presented in carpenter et al 2014 who showed that the suspended solids ss concentration decreased significantly in urban runoff water in the first 20 h of detention on the other hand after 40 h of detaining water in the basin almost no more settling process is realized as reported again in carpenter et al 2014 accordingly it is suggested to gently release the trapped runoff into the receiving watercourse after this time 40 h to restore the system s maximum storage capacity gaborit et al 2012 however as the first objective in this study is to generate low rate outflows it is sometimes desirable to detain water less than 40 h in order to provide enough time for water to discharge when some storage volume is required for the next upcoming rainfall event in all cases this is over the prediction horizon that the predicted data is provided for the system in order to anticipate the future required storage volume while the dynamic outflow scheduling is realized over the control horizon fig 4 all this process will be explained more in section 2 4 having all these in mind the desired detention time is combined with the emptying time of the basin and the characteristics of the next predicted rainfall event s to specify the emptying rule then the selected rule provides the outflow from the basin as a result of manipulating the opening of the outlet gate eqs 9 13 present the proposed rules 9 if t nextrain t e q t q max 10 if t e t nextrain t e 20 h q t q max t e t nextrain t f 11 if t e 20 h t nextrain 40 h t e max q t q max t e 20 h t nextrain t

outflow q max s v req required storage volume for the next coming rainfall event to avoid any overflow in the basin m3 it should be noted that in case of a dry period longer than 40 h t e max after the last rain event the water is retained 40 h in the basin eq 12 to realize the settling process and then released at a gentle outflow rate that allows keeping quiescent conditions in the basin during t e max this limits the emptying of the basin to a certain amount of time that fulfills significant reduction of ss concentration 90 and also avoids any mosquito breeding as justified in gaborit et al 2012 and carpenter et al 2014 2 4 real time control rolling horizon inspired by the rolling horizon decision making approach for model predictive control technology sethi and sorger 1991 a rolling horizon strategy is embedded to the optimization model to realize the rtc and execute the optimization simulation periodically this approach provides a dynamic scheduling based on the planning for few time steps ahead and then moving forward the time horizon at each step after receiving feedbacks from the system following the implementation of the previously determined set points the approach simulates the problem in a way that when real data become available the model updates the information and accordingly re plans for the next remaining time periods example of implementing this rolling horizon approach in the field of stormwater management can be found in duchesne et al 2004 the control horizon selected for the case study presented in this paper is 30 min in which the periods are divided in n 6 optimization time steps of 5 min each also a prediction horizon of 48 h is considered to provide the meteorological forecasting data of the next 48 h for the system as new rainfall data arrives the planning is then rolled over and the model s predictions and decisions are updated this concept is shown schematically in fig 5 using this strategy the real time scheduling of basin s outflow is implemented while considering dynamic meteorological conditions and dynamic runoff volumes 2 5 case study the studied case is a detention basin collecting stormwater from a watershed located in a canadian city this watershed is close to a river on its east side with its outlet to a small ditch which discharges finally to this river based on a master plan published by cogesaf 2010 several water related issues across the watershed have been identified among which the degraded quality of water and several flood episodes which affect the population of downstream areas furthermore according to ouranos 2015 this region will be affected by climate change through having more precipitation by 2050 more runoff flows as well as earlier and less predictable floods in addition in summer higher temperatures lower water levels and sudden severe storms are more probable in the future than now this makes this area an interesting case study benchmark for the proposed predictive rtc strategy where the hypothesis is that employing the proposed integrated rtc approach provides minimized elevated peak flows in the stream and enhanced pollutant sedimentation performance for the studied stormwater management system the studied stormwater detention basin is located in an urban area of the watershed that includes medium density residential and some commercial and institutional lots table 1 and fig 6 the swmm hydraulic model of the studied sector was provided by the city s municipality this model includes the stormwater sewer network of the studied catchment with 104 sub basins and a total area of 162 ha 204 pipe sections totaling more than 13 km pipe diameters ranging from 300 mm to 1800 mm and an overall impermeability of 37 the detention basin has a capacity of 61 495 m3 which allows the collection of runoff resulting from a 100 year return period rainfall event although the basin has a large capacity its outlet is not dynamically controlled so water rarely accumulates into it fig 6 presents the swmm model of the case study watershed there are several problems reported in this drainage network including an overload of the main collector to the detention pond and some parts of the pipes with low or zero slopes which cause additional local surcharges the network previously designed for a 10 year service level no longer meets this level of service due to urban development here are the assumptions of the problem for the case study presented in this paper the control horizon is finite with a value of 30 min while the planning horizon is infinite the prediction horizon is up to 48 h the physical characteristics of the basin are finite and known no evaporation is taken into account there is no infiltration in the basin the inflow to the basin is known obtained from the hydrological hydraulic simulation model zero volume of water in the basin at the start of the plan there is no inflow during dry periods the basin receives inflows during wet periods only perfect prediction data is used when running the integrated rtc algorithm 2 6 rain series characteristics the recorded 5 minute rainfall series observed at a rain gauge located 80 km from the studied watershed is used meteorological characteristics of this region are close to those of the studied case for this station rainfall data are available from may to november for years 2002 and 2005 to 2013 from this series rain events have been created based on two criteria for the purpose of characterizing rainfall series table 3 a minimum of 1 2 mm h of rain and a 6 h inter event duration the average amount of rainfall recorded by environment canada for this station between 2000 and 2017 for the period of may 1 to november 30 is 759 56 mm tables 2 and 3 represent the rainfall characteristics of the 2007 and 2013 rainfall series for a 6 hour inter event duration those two years were chosen because they represent respectively an average and a very rainy year validating the methodology employing the higher available rain volume data series 2013 provides a challenging situation for the studied system and allows to test the performance of the proposed strategy under critical meteorological conditions in addition climate change implication in the next 30 years until 2050 is considered by adding 15 to the actual rainfall series as proposed by ouranos 2015 the hyetographs of rainfall series related to years 2007 and 2013 are illustrated in figs 7 and 8 respectively 2 7 performance criteria different performance criteria are considered to quantify the integrated rtc strategy benefits in terms of peak discharge mitigation water quality improvement overflow prevention improved flow attenuation and outflow variation minimization which are illustrated in table 4 in order to assess the applicability of the proposed model in practice four different scenarios are presented scenario 1 a rainy year 2013 with the studied basin scenario 2 a normal year 2007 with the studied basin scenario 3 a smaller basin with a volume capacity of 20 498 m3 1 3 of the studied basin in a rainy year 2013 and finally scenario 4 the increased 2013 rainfall series to reproduce the effect of the expected climate change with the studied basin it should be noted that all these criteria are formulated for one single event to further evaluate the performance of the whole studied period by calculating their standard deviation also since the perfect forecasting data were used to calculate the predictive performance of the stormwater management basin all the values obtained for the performance criteria are the upper expected bounds these formulations and the presented integrated mathematical model are coded in matlab environment and runs using a desktop pc intel ci7 3 results and discussions in this section the validity of the proposed integrated rtc optimization rule based approach is discussed several storm events are extracted from the one year rainfall series to analyze the performance of the studied system in different meteorological conditions and considering climate change fig 9 represents the outflow schedule resulting from the integrated rtc strategy for the four defined scenarios and table 5 presents a summary of the performance criteria values as shown in fig 9 in all scenarios the stormwater basin experiences a delayed distributed and steady outflow however the results of scenarios 3 and 4 with a smaller basin and in presence of climate change respectively show higher outflow rates the results related to scenario 3 show that the integrated rtc strategy is affected by the volume capacity of the basin and the selected rainfall series nevertheless the dynamic strategy schedules the outflows in such a way that it retains runoff to allow ss sedimentation while attenuating outflows although in higher rates than in other scenarios an average 16 h detention time is reported table 5 for the 2013 series under scenario 3 that comes with an average 73 reduction in peak flows in comparison to the static approach which provides a significant improvement in both quality and quantity points of view similarly under scenario 4 and under climate change the proposed dynamic approach provides an overall 76 reduction in peak flow rates over the traditional static approach even though the integrated rtc strategy generates lower flow attenuation performance criteria higher outflow rates for scenarios 3 and 4 in comparison to scenarios 1 and 2 fig 9 and table 5 it provides a 64 reduction in overall flow rates compared to the static approach table 5 indicates that under different scenarios representing different basin characteristics and different meteorological conditions employing integrated rtc strategy results in a significant improvement in controlling peak flow rate of stormwater discharge in average 48 of the volume capacity of the basin is filled under climate change due to the higher volume of runoff entering the basin this value is 51 in scenario 3 where the capacity of the basin is low while for the less challenging scenarios 1 and 2 12 and 10 of the volume basin respectively are used in average also quality control criteria has been realized at an average of 30 h 23 h 16 h and 19 h under scenarios 1 4 respectively it means that under optimization strategy the system tends to keep water in the available storage while quality control regulations make the system generate delayed outflows to realize optimal detaining of water 3 1 examples of scenarios 1 3 actual meteorological conditions 3 1 1 scenario 1 2007 rainfall series as an average year fig 10 shows the performance of the integrated rtc strategy under the rain event occurring on 26 28 september 2007 versus the traditional static approach this period fig 10 starts with a high rain intensity where outflows from the basin to the receiving water course are high with the static approach while in the controlled approach the received runoff is kept into the basin to allow the settling process in this situation as there are two consecutive rain events predicted for the next 24 h the trapped water is released at a steady rate from 4 15 on september 27 to prevent any possible overflow accordingly the basin is emptied and then the outlet gate is closed at 7 55 on september 27 to detain newly arrived inflows the water volume in the basin continues to rise as far as prediction data storage capacity and control rules allow in all situations to avoid abrupt moves of the outlet gate the generated outflow set points are steady with minimal fluctuations as another example of the performance of the basin when controlled by the rtc approach fig 11 demonstrates the storm events of september 11 17 2007 unlike the static control method which generates the outflow based upon the received runoff without any adaptation the rtc outflow is scheduled in such a way that it always considers the forecasted precipitation an ability that helps the system to perform based on an optimized operational planning 3 1 2 scenario 2 2013 rainfall series as a rainy year fig 12 represents the hydrographs of the stormwater basin outflow when controlled using the integrated rtc strategy versus the static approach during four storm events recorded in may 2013 as it is shown unlike the static approach the rtc strategy detains water in the basin for 20 h after the first rain event to realize sedimentation and then release flows at a steady rate to get prepared for the next upcoming event during the second event which occurred on 21 may beginning at 7 05 the received runoff is trapped in the basin however the rtc strategy decides to open the outlet gate before 20 h of detention at a low steady rate 0 08 m3 s 0 49 l s ha although in this case the detention time is lower that the ideal 20 h it is possible that the 0 08 m3 s outflow rate would allow sedimentation by keeping quiescent conditions in the basin fig 13 illustrates the basin s hydrographs during a 5 day period in september 2013 sharp outflows are imposed to the body of water with the static control as a consequence of runoff inflows employing the integrated rtc strategy results in attenuated and uniform flows at the outfall whilst detaining water in the basin during the rain event of september 12 beginning at 19 35 the optimization model decides to release water to the river slowly as high inflows are predicted for the next hours henceforth right after the further rain event on september 13 all received runoff volume is detained water volume in the basin is 7500 m3 at this time to allow sedimentation and after almost 24 h the outlet opening is set to allow a delayed discharge 3 1 3 scenario 3 low volume basin with 2013 rainfall series to pose an additional challenge to the controlled system a smaller stormwater basin with a volume capacity of 20 498 m3 has been taken into account in such a situation sometimes the optimization model is not able to generate zero value outflows in order to keep the required available storage for the future incoming runoff flows as shown in fig 14 although the gate is partially open from may 24 to 26 the trapped water reaches its maximum volume in the basin this demonstrates the predictive performance of the rtc framework since it is able to anticipate the required volume of storage in near future here 24 h accordingly a 20 h detention time is obtained while providing gentle outflow of 0 36 m3 s which corresponds to 2 22 l s ha at the outfall from 13 05 may 27 to 12 15 may 28 3 2 scenario 4 climate change fig 15 shows the hydrographs of the studied stormwater basin with the modified 15 may 20 30 2013 data series in this case as the system receives high runoff inflows on may 23 the optimization model decides to open the outlet gate at a low percentage in wet period may 23 26 to prevent overflow of the basin while during the original rain event without cc the water is detained for a certain amount of time to allow the settling process it means that in critical situations the integrated rtc strategy prioritizes the quantity control measures avoiding overflow over the quality control ones retaining water looking at the water volume variation fig 15 it can be seen that the storage capacity of the basin reaches its maximum in this case although detaining water in the basin could result in improving the quality of discharged water it could also result in system overflow and even elevated peak flows to the receiving stream hence the designed algorithm performs in a way that besides providing peak flow reduction it generates optimized detention times except when there is a risk of capacity exceedance the efficiency of the system in mitigating the peak flows for the illustrated period in fig 15 is calculated as 78 4 conclusion this study proposed an integrated predictive rtc optimization rule based approach for adaptive and sustainable management of urban stormwater the main threefold contributions that differentiate this study from previous relevant work are summarized as below a predictive rtc optimization model is developed to minimize the peak flows imposed to the receiving watercourse in the downstream area via generating the outflow set points at predefined time steps this optimization model is implemented periodically on a rolling horizon basis four generalized quality control rules are designed considering the next upcoming storm event and the volume of trapped water in the basin unlike the existing control rules in the related state of the art these rules are applicable to all stormwater detention basins the decision level combination of quantity control optimization model and quality control rules provides an integrated approach for rtc of stormwater basin in a dynamic environment whose state is varying from wet to dry or dry to wet period continuously the designed integrated rtc strategy has the potential for optimizing the performance of stormwater management systems facing challenges like urbanization and climate change the dynamic scheduling of the outflows at the outlet of the studied separate sewer network of a city in canada highlights the importance of employing smart approaches on traditional systems in order to enable them to perform in an adaptive and predictive way this predictive nature of the presented rtc approach allows optimizing the outflow rates while generating desired possible detention times for the stormwater management system to improve water quality and preventing overflow of the basin according to the results the hydraulic stress on receiving water body was controlled by reducing peak flows up to 95 although lower values have been reported in more challenging situations like with a lower volume basin or with increased rainfall intensities due to climate change noteworthy is that in all situations the peak flow reduction was at least 73 while preventing any overflow moreover the average detention time of the basin was realized under normal to challenging situations for different scenarios from 16 h to 30 h in comparison to the static approach where in practice there is not any detention time although these two factors were the most important performance criteria when optimizing the problem along with overflow prevention other benefits were identified and quantified when analyzing the final scheduled flows at the outlet of the basin namely flow attenuation and reduced outflow variations although due the perfect prediction data all values obtained for the performance criteria are the upper bounds of the system this provides strong implications for municipal decision makers to computerize the traditional stormwater management systems and exploit their full potential when facing varying environmental conditions the key results of this study lead us to the following conclusions smart control algorithms are enabling stormwater management systems to significantly improve the quality and quantity control performance in presence of climate change the environmental risk can be managed by employing dynamic adaptation measures as an economic and efficient solution transforming sharp fluctuated flows to steady distributed delayed and attenuated outflows is the key indication of the optimized performance of integrated rtc strategy the safety of stormwater basin can be preserved with the proposed algorithm even in case of a low volume capacity basin with the aid of alternative control measures that equilibrate quality and quantity objectives there are several research directions that can be further continued based on this study even though considering control measures at the local scale resulted in optimal performance for that stormwater system it does not guarantee the optimal performance when considering downstream areas globally accordingly the actual framework can be extended to the watershed scale in order to provide a global adaptive measure for the stormwater management systems in this case the complexity of the problem is inevitable for which developing meta heuristic algorithms and incorporating artificial intelligence approaches are recommended additionally in a few time periods the volume stored in the basin reached its maximum capacity this may put the basin at risk of overflow a fact that can be better managed by considering longer term prediction data and or by defining flexible priority coefficients for the quality and quantity objectives finally it is important to consider the uncertainties engaged into the problem in order to produce more reliable solutions here meteorological forecasting error is one of the main sources of uncertainties for which stochastic analysis can provide the best optimal solution also a robust plan can be taken into account as an efficient approach in even the worst case scenarios one should notice that this robustness in the solution may come with excessive costs in all cases a reliable adaptive and sustainable management solution for urban stormwater systems is desirable funding this

6271,this study employed swmm for simulations to elucidate physical mechanisms of lid components in site as well as coupled genetic algorithm with hydrological simulation to determine the optimal spatial configuration of lids in a watershed using main campus of ntu as a case study the results shows that the effectiveness of lid depends on storage capacity in delaying and attenuating discharge prior to the onset of peak inflow with enough surcharge storage control the discharge at the beginning of the rising limb the benefits of the lid s increased with the rainfall recurrence intervals a reversal of effect of peak reduction is observed when the surface storage space has been exhausted at the watershed scale the optimization results revealed that a higher ratio of lid installations in midstream subcatchments than in upstream and in downstream subcatchments hydrograph analysis also explained that installing lid facilities in subcatchments that make their primary contribution to outflow roughly simultaneously with the onset of peak flow is preferable in reducing peak flow at a watershed outlet the finding of this study could be useful to formulate watershed guidelines or strategies for the installation of decentralized flood reduction facilities keywords low impact development optimal spatial distributions genetic algorithm storm water management model hydrograph analysis storm peak reduction 1 introduction changes in hydrological and hydraulic conditions associated with urban development often increase the risk of flooding due largely to the installation of impermeable surfaces james 1965 leopold 1968 anderson 1970 hollis 1975 many existing urban flood control systems lack adequate drainage capacity to deal with the increased flooding brought about by climate change denault et al 2006 lienert et al 2013 unfortunately the installation of new storm drains and alterations to existing systems impose high construction costs arnbjerg nielsen and fleischer 2009 willems et al 2012 in many cases adding new drains is nearly impossible due to the fact the main pipes are situated beneath arterial roads grafton et al 2015 the social impact of modifying drainage systems actually much exceeds the construction costs in the past most drainage systems were centralized however planners have recently been considering decentralized point facilities e g low impact development lid which process storm water runoff close to the source numerous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of this approach to urban flooding booth and jackson 1997 niemczynowicz 1999 roy et al 2008 semadeni davies et al 2008 lid was first proposed in north america and new zealand in the 1980 s to deal with water quality issues it was later used to reduce surface runoff and peak flow during floods fletcher et al 2015 lid such as bioretention cells permeable pavement and green roofs make it possible to reduce flood peak and eliminate environmental problems associated with urban development askarizadeh et al 2015 fletcher et al 2015 vogel et al 2015 bhaskar et al 2016 although many urban managers engineers and policy makers see lid as an effective method to overcome the consequences of climate change and urban development most lid applications focus on the implementation of single facilities rather than a watershed wide approach consequently the effectiveness of lid under rainfall events of greater intensity and duration remains unclear previous studies have shown that lid can reduce the risk of flooding for example james and dymond 2011 zahmatkesh et al 2014 and ahiablame and shakya 2016 performed case studies on the effectiveness of lid schemes such as bioretention cells permeable paving and rain barrels in decreasing surface runoff or peak flow at downstream outlets their results demonstrated the effectiveness of lid in flood reduction under a variety of rainfall conditions they also showed that combining multiple types of lid is preferable to focusing on a single lid solution ahiablame and shakya 2016 in a comparison of lid solutions in terms of capital costs and runoff reduction joksimovic and alam 2014 found that vegetated swales present the lowest cost per unit volume of runoff reduction but they are far less effective in reducing peak discharge infiltration trenches and bioretention schemes are often the most effective of the solutions deemed economically feasible the influence of most lid facility related parameters such as lid size and installation area ratio have not been well elucidated nonetheless it has been shown that the rainfall recurrence and the retention volume of lid are important factors in flood control and the efficiency of runoff reduction measures lid reaches its reduction limit when the retention volume is filled gilroy and mccuen 2009 qin et al 2013 qin et al 2013 reported that swales are the most effective for rainfall with an early peak whereas permeable pavement is best suited to rainfall with a middle peak and green roofing is best suited for rainfall that peaks late lid is most effective when implemented to stagger peak discharge from different sewersheds gilroy and mccuen 2009 morsy et al 2016 used a numerical model to simulate outlet water levels and the surface runoff of rain gardens under various rainfall conditions they found that berm height rain garden area and diverted runoff i e the percentage of runoff produced by impervious areas diverted to rain gardens largely determine the effectiveness of rain gardens in preventing floods palla and gnecco 2015 pointed out that reduced runoff volume depends on the retention capacity of lid they also noted that hydrologic performance including peak reduction volume detention and hydrograph delay is linearly dependent on reducing the effective area that remains impervious to rainwater they also noted that peak flow decreases linearly with the length of the rainfall return period gilroy and mccuen 2009 conducted a similar study to determine the influence of rainfall recurrence on efforts to reduce flooding they postulated that the underlying mechanisms determine the flood reduction capacity of individual lid facilities whereas the spatial distribution of the facilities determines the effectiveness of multiple facilities operating in series unfortunately those studies did not closely investigate the physical mechanisms underlying lid which are crucial to understanding the capacity and limitations of such efforts most studies used computer simulations to investigate the impact of lid within a given watershed a number of software programs are available for numerical simulation and the analysis of lid jayasooriya and ng 2014 among these programs storm water management model swmm is recognized as one of the more sophisticated and comprehensive software packages for simulating the quality and quantity of water systems swmm is probably the most popular urban stormwater model today due to its ability to simulate the entire urban runoff system using robust surface runoff and bmp lid and flow routing algorithms rossman 2010 burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 fletcher et al 2013 zahmatkesh et al 2014 as discussed the spatial distribution of lid facilities strongly influences their effectiveness in flood reduction however the complexity of patterns in stormwater runoff in urban systems makes it difficult to determine their impact at the watershed scale mejía and moglen 2009 2010a b investigated the spatial distribution of impervious surfaces in urban areas they reported that effective impervious area spatial connectivity and the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall have a pronounced influence on hydrological responses at the catchment outlet however it remains unclear whether the benefits of extensive lid at the watershed level are sufficient to justify the costs mejía and moglen 2009 a number of studies have used optimization algorithms to compare the effectiveness of lid configurations at the watershed scale however these issues are not always considered from a hydrologic perspective zhang et al 2006 2013 used genetic algorithms gas to maximize the effects of bioretention cells permeable pavement and green roofs on runoff while minimizing costs similarly jia et al 2015 used the sustain model and a ga to optimize lid to reduce peak flow and deal effectively with pollutants while minimizing costs huang et al 2018 used a simulated annealing algorithm with the benefit cost ratio as an objective function to optimize eight lid components in the min sheng community of taipei city most previous studies promoted the large scale use of bioretention cells or green roofs due to their large storage capacity with support from permeable pavement huang et al 2018 also suggested installing these lid facilities in upstream subcatchments or areas of higher elevation damodaram and zechman 2012 divided north carolina state university campus into 60 subcatchments and then used a ga to optimize the configuration of permeable pavement and rainwater harvesting methods under strict budgetary constraints they found that detention ponds are particularly effective in reducing peak flow they also found that identical effects could be achieved by varying lid combinations and that flexibility increases with the size of the lid installation area cano and barkdoll 2016 used a multi objective optimization algorithm mosebend multi objective socio economic boundary emanating nearest distance to facilitate the selection of lid facilities with the aim of restoring runoff to natural values while minimizing costs they compared 20 scenarios involving the establishment of lid downstream to upstream and upstream to downstream their results revealed that implementing lid in steeper upstream areas was the most efficient approach in terms of the cost benefit ratio this contradicts the intuitive view that lid should be established midstream and downstream of catchments heuristic algorithms such as gas overcome the limitations of conventional computational schemes which are prone to local optimality traps moreover heuristic algorithms usually bypass complex calculation processes in obtaining a gradient thereby making it easier to solve problems with multiple variables and high nonlinearity in contrast to studies applying only one kind of heuristic optimization reichold et al 2009 adopted a hybrid approach in conjunction with local as well as global optimum search methods to derive spatial configurations for urban development in the catchment with the least impact on the environment this approach features high convergence speed provided by the nm method as well as the ability to escape local optima provided by the ga xu et al 2018 applied the marginal cost based greedy strategy mcgs to find the optimal solution of maximum flood reduction at minimum cost compared to a ga mcgs requires fewer iterations and also provides a larger number of alternatives and better solutions however this algorithm is very limited when dealing with complex environmental problems previous studies have elucidated the effects of lid however most researchers examined phenomena from a specific perspective and seldom presented a comprehensive evaluation of the underlying physical and or hydrological mechanisms to fill this gap this study employed swmm to examine the physical mechanisms of lid components in subcatchments we then extended the scope of our analysis to the watershed scale swmm was used in conjunction with a ga our primary objective was to minimize downstream peak flow in determining the optimal lid spatial distribution we also employed hydrological methods and considered the physical mechanisms of lid in our analysis this made it possible to formulate basic guidelines for the installation of decentralized flood reduction facilities within a given catchment based on the spatial and physical characteristics of lid 2 methodology reducing downstream peak flow through the installation of lids requires a watershed strategy informed by comprehensive knowledge of the underlying hydrological mechanisms it is important to know both how elements of the lid system deal with precipitation at the source and how runoff is redistributed within the watershed this study examined lid applications at these two different scales this information is essential for optimized design especially within strict budgetary constraints we utilized swmm one of the most popular rainfall runoff models used for urban water resource management to simulate the effect of lid facilities ga optimization was then coupled with hydrological simulation to determine the optimal spatial configuration of lids in a watershed 2 1 study area national taiwan university campus the study performed a case study of the main campus of ntu the main campus is located in the daan district of taipei city an important educational commercial residential and cultural area covering approximately 1 13 km2 the campus is enclosed by four arterial roads with major drains beneath therefore the campus can be considered an independent catchment ntu occupies a relatively small piece of land and data is available for the entire drainage system in this study we conducted hydrological and hydraulic analysis of far greater detail than that seen in previous studies the office of general affairs at ntu commissioned a comprehensive survey of the campus in order to establish a complete geographic information system gis as well as a database pertaining to all manholes and pipelines it is for this reason that this site was selected as our study area the drainage system on the ntu campus is divided into several independent blocks each of which has its own outlet as shown in fig 1 among the eight drainage systems a g block a is the most complex and covers the largest area unfortunately much of the pipeline data in block a is missing or unusable which could greatly hinder the representation of this system in swmm and would no doubt lead to discrepancies between simulations and reality thus we selected block b as the primary study area for analysis block b is roughly 0 2 km2 approximately a fifth of the ntu campus and the degree of complexity is similar to that seen in typical urban drainage systems 2 2 swmm simulation swmm was first developed by the environmental protection agency of the united states us epa in 1971 it provides wide functionality in the simulation of hydrological and hydraulic mechanisms such as rainfall runoff processes and urban system drainage this system has also been shown to outperform other schemes in terms of flow routing in underdrain networks lid components also been included in the software package since version 5 0 22 and many of the problems in earlier versions have been dealt with the current version of swmm used in this study was version 5 1 013 in this case study the setup of the swmm model was based on the ntu main campus drainage and pavement survey analysis and planning result report hereinafter referred to as the report compiled by shengyu engineering consulting co ltd as shown in fig 1 the report clearly delineates the eight major catchments of the campus the numerical model in our study area block b contained 30 subcatchments 33 conduits 33 junctions and one outfall these subcatchments also known as sewersheds are delineated in accordance with the buildings terrain pipeline direction and roads along the pipelines on the gis platform aerial images with 1 m resolution were used to identify impervious areas e g buildings and roads as well as pervious areas e g green spaces we then calculated the proportions of pervious and impervious areas in each delineated subcatchment and averaged the slope using data generated by digital elevation models dems the infiltration of water into the soil was calculated using horton s equation based on field soil condition a summary of model parameter settings is listed in table 1 the report provided the maximum depth of most of the manholes the elevation at the bottom of the junctions was obtained using arcgis by overlaying the location of a given junction on a dem to derive its surface elevation from which the maximum depths were subtracted and applied in the model administrators at ntu provided the length cross section shape and dimensions of the sewers as well as the inlet offset and outlet offset most of the sewer networks were constructed using reinforced concrete for which manning s coefficient was set at 0 015 the main direction of flow was toward xinhai road located on the northern side of ntu campus outflow at all boundaries was deemed free fall based on the difference in elevation the lid components used in this study included 1 the most common bioretention cells comprising a surface layer a soil layer a storage layer and an underdrain and 2 permeable pavement comprising a surface layer a pavement layer a storage layer and an underdrain under optional settings we stipulated that both types of component include drainage pipes in their water storage layers however the permeable pavement did not include a soil layer as a result rainfall runoff quickly infiltrated the pavement layer into the storage layer table 2 lists the parameter settings of the lid components 2 3 hydrological conditions many hydraulic facilities urban drainage systems in particular are designed for specific rainfall intensities however the fact that lid uses small retention detention facilities means that rainfall duration is also an important issue in exploring the functionality of lid systems during rainfall events we applied the official hyetographs designed for each rainfallscenario in northern taiwan water resources agency 2001 with six different return periods 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year events and six durations 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 9 h and 12 h the range of rainfall intensity was from 11 10 mm hr 12 h 2 year to 132 76 mm hr 1 h 100 year we sought to identify the mechanisms underlying retention and detention by which lid facilities reduce peak flooding by examining a number of hydrological variables including storage water levels infiltration rates soil water content inflow and outflow at various time points 2 4 optimization algorithm gas represent an iterative heuristic approach to dealing with optimization problems they enable convergence to a near global optimum through evolution while escaping local optima through the preservation of diversity in the offspring population via iterative mutation each iteration includes calculations to determine the adaptability of individual solutions to the objective function individual solutions are selected for breeding in a mating pool based on the roulette method the subsequent child generation undergoes random genetic mutations in accordance with a preset rate mutation values cover a larger range during the first stages of evolution to accelerate convergence and a smaller range during the final stages to prevent convergence failure in this study a ga was used to adjust lid design parameters in swmm with the aim of optimizing an objective function that considers budget limitations as well as physical constraints for example the upper limit of the overall area was the sum of the areas of each subcatchment which means that the lid facilities could cover no more than the area of subcatchments with a lower limit of 0 the optimization problem can be formulated as follows 1 max x p x subject to x l r t p 0 c x b 0 x i where x is a matrix of control variables including l the ratio of lid installation area to total watershed area r the ratio of bioretention to total lid installation area t the ratio of impervious area treated by lid and p the ratio of impervious area treated by bioretention to that treated by both lid facilities these variables range between 0 and 1 which can be dealt directly using a ga p x is the objective function i e peak flow reduction at the outlet of the entire watershed which could only be obtained using swmm simulation to assess various lid setups c x refers to the cost of installing lid and b is the budgetary constraint set to 50 million and 100 million ntd we adopted the penalty method in considering this constraint such that the objective function is reformulated as follows 2 max f x p x σ g x g x g x max 0 c x b 2 where g x is the penalty function and σ is the penalty coefficient our optimization algorithm was coded by the first author using python python is an object oriented programming language that uses simple syntax we employed the roulette selection function of the pyvolution 1 1 plug in extension for gas we coded the other parts manually because the pyvolution 1 1 data structure could not accommodate the complexity required for this study note that we also considered using the nonlinear programming algorithm broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs to formulate our optimization problem unlike heuristic algorithms such as gas bfgs is a quasi newtonian nonlinear programming scheme that uses a specific mathematical formula to estimate the gradients corresponding to different vectors second derivatives are used to calculate a hessian matrix as an optimization improvement mechanism thereby enabling the solutions to converge more quickly than would be possible using a heuristic algorithm many lid combinations actually produce almost identical effects and produce local optimums in the feasible region furthermore any adjustment to the variables has only a limited impact on peak flow at the downstream outlet due to the low resolution of the swmm results this makes the traditional nonlinear algorithm such as bfgs would be difficult to detect improvements within a given iteration and therefore become trapped in a local optimum consequently we opted for a ga instead of bfgs to deal with our lid optimization problem 3 results and discussions 3 1 effectiveness of single lid before examining lid installation strategies we simulated the performance of lid in a single sewershed under a variety of rainfall events our objective was to identify the physical mechanisms underlying lid performance which could then be used to examine the performance of installations in terms of the overall catchment the representative sewershed selected for this part of the study was a 1 3 ha area adjoining choushan road 56 35 of which was impervious the specifications of this representative sewershed are listed in table 3 a budget of ntd 1 million allowed for the installation of either 166 67 m2 of bioretention cell s or 333 33 m2 of permeable pavement covering the entire region of study we assumed that the installed facility would be capable of dealing with runoff from an impervious area approximately three times that of the installation we compared the performance of the two schemes in terms of reducing peak flow under 36 rainfall conditions based on a detailed reported generated by swmm fig 2 a and b compare the performance of two lid solutions bioretention cells and permeable pavement in terms of reducing peak flow in a single sewershed under rainfall events with a duration of 1 h the benefits of the bioretention cells increased with the intensity of the rainfall events from 0 022 m3 s 2 year event to 0 037 m3 s 50 year event interestingly for events with a return period exceeding 50 years the effects of the bioretention cells reversed which resulted in 0 035 m3 s for 100 year events a similar reversal was observed for rainfall events with a duration of 2 h wherein the most pronounced peak reduction was achieved when applied to rainfall events with a 5 year return period for rainfall events of longer duration the effectiveness of the bioretention cells was inversely proportional to the return period for rainfall events of 1 h duration the effectiveness of permeable pavement in reducing peak flow increased consistently with the return period from 0 041 m3 s 2 year events to 0 064 m3 s 100 year events for rainfall events of 2 h duration the effectiveness of permeable pavement decreased with the return period from 0 023 m3 s 2 year events to 0 016 m3 s 100 year events for rainfall events of longer durations the effects of the permeable pavement were the opposite of those seen in rainfall events of 1 h duration we then increased the area of the installed lid facility by three times and kept all other settings constant including the amount of runoff treated by the installed facility the capacity of the storage space underground and surface increased proportionally to the area therefore the capacity of the lid facility in this case exceeded that in previous cases the results in fig 2 c and d revealed that under these conditions the lid was somewhat effective in reducing peak flow regardless of the rainfall conditions in fact the lid even proved effective against rainfall of extended durations we also observed that with an increase in storage space the severity of events that would induce turnaround increased from those with 1 h 50 year and 2 h 5 year return period to those with a 3 h 50 year return period this means that the degree to which lid can reduce peak flow is proportional to the availability of storage space we also observed reductions in peak flow under rainfall durations of 6 h 9 h and 12 h the effects of which increased with the length of the return period understanding the limitations of lid facilities and maximizing their effectiveness is crucial in real world applications detailed reports of lid from swmm help to elucidate the underlying mechanism s the output results in the detailed reports were converted into unit area which can be viewed as a process of non dimensionalizing area variables with different installation areas fig 3 presents the data extracted from swmm which was used to characterize the performance of bioretention cells when applied to 1 h and 2 h rainfall events with various return periods we also added three auxiliary lines to the graphs the green horizontal dotted line shows the water storage limit based on a given berm height of 150 mm the black horizontal dotted line indicates the depth between the underdrain pipes in the storage layer and the bottom of the storage layer 250 mm the red vertical dotted line indicates the time point corresponding to maximum inflow lid facilities are designed to reduce peak discharge runoff by compensating for losses of rainfall abstraction and an increase in the time of concentration the maximum rate of percolation into the storage layer created by bioretention cells is 50 mm h which is primarily determined by the soil layer in simulation scenarios the rainfall intensity can be very high e g peaking at 154 mm h for 2 year 1 h events or even 324 mm h for 100 year 1 h events and inflow due to discharge from impervious areas can also be high this means there would not be enough time for water to percolate into the bottom storage layer particularly during intense rainfall events of short duration when the surface soil becomes saturated ponding water accumulates within the surface storage space until it reaches the height of the berm thus when faced with intense rainfall events of short duration most of the reduction in peak flow due to bioretention cells can be attributed to surface storage above the soil layer rather than the bottom storage layer the function of bioretention cells is similar to that of small detention ponds as long as the surface water level does not reach the height of the berm before the onset of peak inflow then storage space remains and no surface runoff flows out from this site as shown in the results of 2 5 and 10 year events in fig 3 a the remaining capacity within the berm increases the degree to which peak flow can be reduced under 25 50 and 100 year events the surface water level exceeded the height of the berm prior to the onset of peak inflow as indicated by the dashed pink line in the figure this indicates that the surface storage space was exhausted and the discharge of surface runoff had already begun red solid line at the onset of peak inflow in this case attenuation involves the temporary storage of surface water and a delay inpeak discharge however this effect diminishes with an increase in inflow which leads to more water storage and accelerates flood peak propagation in the lid facility the peak discharge is delayed by approximately 9 min 7 min and 6 min for 25 year 50 year and 100 year rainfall events of 1 h durations respectively rainfall of higher intensity exhausts lid storage more rapidly and induces discharge sooner bioretention cells were shown to have the most pronounced effect on events with a return period of 25 years as shown in fig 3 b this situation is similar to that of rainfall events with a 2 h duration regardless of the return period when facing an event with a 2 year return period bioretention cells are able to retain all of the water up to the onset of peak flow when facing an event with a 5 year return period the storage capacity of bioretention cells is rapidly exhausted but the effects of peak flow are attenuated by the provision of temporary storage which can greatly reduce the effects of flooding as the intensity of events increases as represented by an increase in return period the level of the surface water responds more rapidly in response to changes in inflow thereby reducing the degree to which discharge is delayed for 50 and 100 year events there is essentially no lag between changes in inflow and the discharge of surface runoff which means that no surcharge storage is available to accommodate peak flow and thereby delay outflow the storage layer of permeable pavement is thinner than that of bioretention cells furthermore the underdrain pipes are above the bottom of the storage layer 200 mm in this case the relatively high hydraulic conductivity of the permeable pavement material allows the passage of rainfall into the storage layer in most cases permeable pavement does not have a middle soil layer which would otherwise hinder infiltration into the storage layer with the result that storage capacity is rapidly exhausted furthermore permeable pavement does not usually have extruding berms so it can only deal with runoff via temporary surcharge storage fig 4 a presents the characteristics of permeable pavement under the effects of a 1 h rainfall event note that the cost of permeable pavement is half that of bioretention cells therefore for a given budget permeable pavement could be applied to an area of double the size with presumably two times the overall effect as shown in fig 4 a there would be sufficient storage space beneath the permeable pavement to provide an effective buffer against a 1 h rainfall event with 2 year return period even though the available storage is exhausted permeable pavement would still be more effective in reducing peak flow during 5 year events than during a 2 year event due to the fact that there was little discharge at the beginning of the rising limb of outflow nonetheless the enormous volume of water that falls during 5 year to 100 year events rapidly exhausts the capacity of the storage layer leaving only surface storage space as with bioretention surface storage attenuation is the primary mechanism in peak flow reduction in this study permeable pavement covered more area than do bioretention installations for a given budget therefore outflow discharge in paved areas was less sensitive to inflow of the same magnitude as a result the attenuation of discharge is more effective when there is a longer peak delay when facing a rainfall event with a return period of more than 100 years maximum peak attenuation could occur within one hour similarly the underground storage required for peak inflow could be exhausted within 2 h regardless of the rainfall intensity i e event return period this means that surface storage attenuation the effects of which are less pronounced under storms of greater intensity serves as the primary mechanism affecting a reduction in peak flow permeable pavement could only be expected to attenuate the peak flow associated with 1 h events our results indicate that both bioretention and permeable pavement function optimally when the flow is attenuated using temporary surcharge storage in addition to the conventional approach of compensating for losses and postponing the occurrence of discharge discharge from lid facilities increases at 5 2 power of the flow depth manning s formula and the depth of the water responds linearly on the amount of inflow this means that maximum peak reduction occurs at a specific depth satisfying the first order condition at which the increasing the peak inflow would not lead to a situation in which incremental runoff discharge exceeds inflow the water depth leading that would most effectively reduce peak flow varies with rainfall pattern and the characteristics of the lid as shown in fig 5 bioretention would be the most effective solution when faced with 23 year 1 h rainfall events the effects of lid in reducing peak flow under rainfall of 1 h duration would be reversed when dealing with storms of greater intensity greater than23 year return period thus that turnaround in fig 2 a occurs at 25 year 1 hr which is the closest point to 23 year 1 hr in our simulations the peak flow attenuation provided by permeable pavement would not diminish despite an increase in the intensity of events with a duration of 1 h as a result it is likely that permeable pavement would be most effective solution for rainfall events with a return period of more than 100 years when facing 2 h rainfall events bioretention could be expected to function continuously by allowing water to percolate into underneath storage this would make it the most effective solution for rainfall events with a return period of 2 to 5 years in contrast the performance of permeable pavement diminishes with an increase in rainfall intensity i e longer return period for lid implementations with higher capacity compensating for abstraction loss and attenuating peak flow would both help to deal with the inundation that comes with rainfall events of greater intensity and or longer duration detailed reports from swmm again demonstrate that runoff storage capacity is the primary factor influencing the effectiveness of lid measures chui et al 2016 used sensitive analysis to identify the factors with the greatest influence on the effectiveness of lid they concluded that the conductivity of the soil layer is the most important parameter for bioretention cells and permeable pavement only if the hydraulic conductivity were low and or design storm were large would the berm height have an effect in reducing peak runoff rainfall in taiwan is far higher than in most other areas of the world and hydraulic conductivity is relatively low under these conditions berm height is the most important factor this may explain why our results differ slightly from those of chui et al 2016 despite the fact that there was generally agreement between the two studies only solutions that delay discharge and attenuate peak flow can be fully effective ideally storage capacity would be exhausted within a suitable period of time i e runoff would start at the beginning of the rising limb these observations indicate that shorter rainfall events 1 3 h could be most effectively dealt with by installing permeable pavement permeable pavement does not have a soil layer to control inflow rate which means that it is able to absorb large amounts of surface runoff very quickly it also has a low cost per unit area which allows the conversion of large areas bioretention cells are preferable for rainfall events of longer duration 6 12 h these feature a soil layer that controls the amount of water that enters the storage layer the depth of the storage layer also allows for the storage of runoff produced in the early stages of the rainfall event thereby reserving surface storage space for the later stages nonetheless neither of the proposed methods are able to reduce peak flows for rainfall of longer durations or higher intensities the change in the turnaround of peak flow reduction effects can be attributed to the fact that the effectiveness of lid facilities in reducing peak flow under the rainfall patterns of taiwan depends on the availability and attenuation of surface storage space at the time of peak flow onset preventing the premature exhaustion of surface storage space requires the absorption of water by underground storage layers the arrival of peak flow generally coincides with high rainfall intensity and high inflow from runoff only when infiltration is too slow to keep up with rainfall does surface storage provided by berms and surcharge storage assume the burden thus the effectiveness of lid solutions in reducing peak flow depends on whether the depth of underground storage layers the height of the underdrain pipe the conductivity of the soil layer and the height of the berm are sufficient to attenuate the expected peak flow thus there is a clear need for methods by which to control inflow and outflow rates to enable the rapid absorption of water without prematurely exhausting storage capacity i e not before the onset of peak flow swmm reports provide considerable insight into the effectiveness of lid solutions however swmm standardizes the model to ensure applicability to a wide range of situations failing to consider all of the functions of lid components the first issue is outflow from the lid facility in real world lid implementations outlets are commonly given small openings in order to control water flow unfortunately the lid components in swmm do not allow for the adjustment of outlets from the surface layer routing subcatchment runoff is simulated by the kinematic wave procedure which employs the unit width approach based on a rectangular plane with a preselected width thus in swmm simulations the width and length of lid components are crucial parameters affecting retention performance and peak flow if the time required for water to pass through the lid system were overestimated then the time at which the runoff flows out of the lid component would be brought forward rather than delayed it is even possible for lid outflow to overlap and thereby increase the peak outflow of the subcatchment into the junction this is precisely opposite to the desired effect which cannot be simulated effectively with swmm if the time required for water to pass through the lid system were underestimated then the proposed lid solution would have retention performance superior to that reflected in the simulation in swmm the installation of lid facilities results in the replacement of impervious areas of a given width rain falling on the remaining impervious areas is unilaterally diverted to lid components based on the percentage of impervious area that they cover we suggest adjusting the width of lid components based on the concept of an equivalent rectangular cascading plane in order to bring the length of the lid component in line with the actual flow path rather than the actual length another approach to resolving this problem involves dividing each subcatchment into three subcatchments respectively containing the impervious areas pervious areas and lid installation areas this approach makes it possible to more correctly present the time at which runoff passes impervious areas weir components could also be installed to control lid inflows and outflows in order to bring them in line with the intended flow control imposed by actual inlets and outlets however it would impose a massive increase in labor and computational overhead because any adjustment to the area of the lid installation would necessitate adjustments to all three areas another issue is the fact that swmm simulates the flow unilaterally rather than bilaterally from one component to another this simplification omits two dimensional overland calculations with the result that water would accumulate to form ponds in the area directly above the lid even if there was no berm at the surface ponding or inundation to a depth of 30 cm would no doubt flow outward into neighboring areas while simulations in swmm may not which would be entirely unreasonable based on calculations using the manning formula we determined that outflow over lid components due to surface flooding is proportional to the width of the outflow from lid components the resulting overestimates pertaining to the depth and volume of surface surcharge storage would lead to overestimates pertaining to the reductions in peak flow provided by lid 3 2 optimizing lid at the watershed scale another objective of this study was to determine the optimal spatial distribution of lid in terms of area assuming that all lid components are configured similarly the objective of these efforts was to enable a comparison of scenarios under various budgetary constraints we also conducted analysis on the optimal spatial distributions under 36 rainfall conditions with limited budgets of ntd 50 or 100 million our results were compiled as a box and whisker plot with the numbers of the 30 subcatchments on the horizontal axis and the area or proportion of lid installation on the vertical axis fig 6 the top and bottom ends of the whiskers respectively indicate the maximum and minimum values whereas the tops and bottoms of the boxes represent the third 75 and first 25 quartiles the black lines in the middle of the boxes represent the second quartile 50 which is also the median the arithmetic means are marked with a blue rhombus we indicated the proportions of the original impervious areas in the subcatchments using green dots specific peak flow reduction effects could be achieved using any number of lid implementations that differ in spatial distribution resulting in various interquartile ranges our optimization results revealed that the lid facilities accessible within this budget could be effective in reducing peak flow under most rainfall conditions the optimization variables used in this analysis included lid installation area and the percentage of impervious area undergoing treatment table 4 shows that the most pronounced decreases in peak flow were for 100 year 1 h rainfall events as follows 4 646 m3 s i e 44 8 reduction in peak flow with ntd 50 million budget and 5 917 m3 s i e 57 6 reduction in peak flow with ntd 100 million budget the least pronounced decreases in peak flow in terms of magnitude were for 2 year 12 h rainfall events as follows 0 131 m3 s ntd 100 million budget and 0 283 m3 s ntd 50 million budget the least pronounced reductions in peak flow in terms of percentage were for a 100 year 12 h rainfall event as follows 4 5 and 11 3 the above results are in good agreement with our results obtained from lid characteristic analysis the situation examined in this study included adequate storage space therefore lid would be highly effective in reducing peak flow under rainfall events of shorter durations the decrease in peak flow would become increasingly pronounced with an increase in rainfall intensity however the effects would become less pronounced with an increase in rainfall duration in addition the reduction ratio may be too low for events of long duration and higher intensity the optimal spatial distribution under the various rainfall conditions varied in accordance with the intensity and duration of the rainfall we divided the study area into five zones as shown in fig 7 table 5 shows the proportions and locations of the various lid installations under this scheme zone i subcatchments b12 b15 was located in the upstream portion of the main line and included the lowest proportion of lid installations zone ii subcatchments b16 b20 and zone iv subcatchments b28 b38 were located in the midstream portion of the main line and included the highest proportions of lid installations similar to zone i zone iii subcatchments b21 b27 was situated in the upstream portion of a branch line and included a similar proportion of lid installations in terms of the median value although its mean was far lower than those of zones ii and iv nonetheless it is a feature of optimal lid spatial distributions that a few extreme values under specific rainfall conditions would be high enough for the mean to exceed the median thus it is appropriate to use the median for comparison and analysis zone v subcatchments b39 b44 was closest to the outlet and included a moderate proportion of lid installations comparing to our results hwang et al 2017 and sohn et al 2017 demonstrated that the spatial distribution of directly connected impervious area dcia influences the volume of peak flow and runoff they suggested installing lid in areas of higher dcia concentration regarding the location of lid in watershed further suggestion or explanation were not clearly identified in these studies this study confirmed the ratio of impervious area is related to the ratio of lid installed area in most cases nonetheless the distance to the outlet could be more strongly correlated with lid installations we were concerned that there may be a relationship linking the distances among subcatchments and outfall and the area covered by lid installations we first set outfall b as the origin in calculating the flow distance between this point and the outlet of each subcatchment fig 8 was then plotted with this distance set as an independent variable and the area covered by installations and the ratio of lid installations as dependent variables since the areas of each sewersheds differ the ratio of lid installations and the distance to outfall b see fig 8 b provides a more reasonable interpretation we can see that the results fit well with a second order curve further we can see that the ratio of lid installations in midstream subcatchments was higher than in upstream and in downstream subcatchments we conducted more thorough analysis using fixed durations paired with variable return periods and fixed return periods paired with variable durations in the following we consider only the situation involving a budget of ntd 100 million however the results would be similar under different budgetary constraints as shown in fig 9 the patterns in lid installation proportions under shorter rainfall durations 1 2 and 3 h were roughly identical to those obtained in the overall analysis in contrast the patterns obtained under longer rainfall durations 6 9 and 12 h were irregular and presented no similarities this can be attributed to variations in the effectiveness of lid installations in reducing peak flow under various rainfall conditions when faced with rainfall of longer durations there is a lack of adequate storage space to mediate flow even before peak flow onset in this situation most of the lid facilities are rendered ineffective which means that no spatial configuration would be able to reduce the peak flow at the downstream outlet resulting in the scattered appearance of the lid installation proportions we also fixed return periods to show changes in lid distribution under rainfall events of various durations as shown in fig 10 the proportions of the various lid installations differed considerably no particular trend was observed for 2 year events however as the length of the return period increased the proportion of lid installations moved closer to the overall analysis results obtained under the 36 rainfall conditions this is in complete opposition to the analysis involving fixed durations and variable return periods the lid facilities were highly effective when facing 2 year and 5 year events regardless of rainfall duration and were therefore able to reduce peak flow in most of the spatial configurations the patterns of lid installations in the optimized results were extremely scattered i e a higher proportion of installation in some of the subcatchments when facing 2 year and 5 year events but a lower proportion in the same subcatchments when facing longer return periods moreover we observed an increase in the difference between the mean and median proportion of lid installations in subcatchments b21 b27 as the length of the return period increased i e rainfall intensity became increasingly severe the importance of lid spatial distribution became increasingly evident when facing 100 year events it would be preferable to have lid facilities extremely concentrated in zones ii iv and v with almost no installations in zones i and iii 3 3 hydrograph analysis a number of studies have applied ga based optimization to lid installations however they provided little or no explanation as to the means by which spatial distribution could be used to enhance the effectiveness of efforts to reduce peak flow in this study we conducted hydrograph analysis to elucidate the mechanisms operant under the various lid spatial distributions based on the concept of unit hydrographs and the contribution of each subcatchment to the overall outflow hydrograph we calculated the s hydrograph of each subcatchment under rainfall intensity of 10 mm h over a period of 120 min this made it possible to characterize the impact of each subcatchment on outflow within the context of the optimization results hydrograph analysis was conducted by eliminating one subcatchment and then comparing the results with those obtained under the original conditions the contribution made by the subcatchment that was eliminated was the difference between the two results we repeated the elimination of one subcatchment in each step until we derived the contribution of all of the subcatchments in terms of outflow fig 11 in fig 11 the black vertical dotted line indicates the time at which peak flow occurred at the outlet of the watershed we also applied the nelder mead optimization algorithm to select the time interval with the highest correlation coefficient between the ratio of lid installations and the ratio of outflow volume within this interval compared to that of the entire period as can be seen peak flow onset occurred at 139 min selecting a time interval between 93 min and 194 min red dotted lines in fig 11 provided the highest correlation coefficient of 0 534 this could be used as a rule of thumb for any watershed that contributes more to the peak outflow of the entire basin in these situations increasing the area covered by lid facilities would be a more efficient approach to reducing peak flow in the entire basin in our case study the peak outflow of this subcatchment was roughly between 45 and 55 min before and after the onset of peak flow our objective in installing lid facilities was to reduce peak flow at the downstream outlet similarly eckart et al 2018 used multiobjective optimization to obtain cost effectiveness curves of lid with the aim of reducing volume during peak flow they reported that it would be better to install lid in high runoff areas however their results do not bear this out establishing lid in areas of high runoff appears to be an obvious solution however we posit that the location and distance to the outlet are even more important this can be explained by the fact that any attempt to attenuate peak flow at the outlet must consider runoff as well as the lag time in that particular catchment looking only at the hydrological characteristics we can see that most of the subcatchments that make their main contribution to outflow after the onset peak flow are located in the upstream portion of the subcatchments e g b12 and b14 in these subcatchments no efforts to reduce peak flow would be particularly effective rather lid facilities should be concentrated in subcatchments that make a meaningful contribution during the target time interval we also looked at the physical mechanisms underlying the functionality of lid facilities the ability of lid facility to reduce peak flow depends on access to and the size of the underground storage layer as well as the availability of surface storage space i e a certain amount of storage space must remain available prior to the onset of peak flow our investigation of hydrological characteristics and the underlying physical mechanisms revealed that it is preferable to install lid facilities in subcatchments that make their primary contribution to outflow roughly simultaneously with the onset of peak flow lid facilities in subcatchments with higher early outflow e g b44 b43 and b41 are limited in the degree to which they are able to reduce peak flow due simply to the fact that their storage capacities are exhausted more rapidly installing lid facilities in these subcatchments would not be an appropriate allocation of resources 4 conclusions in this study we implemented simulations of single subcatchments to elucidate the physical mechanisms by which lid facilities reduce peak flow from rainfall the effectiveness of bioretention cells and permeable pavement depends on storage capacity at the onset of peak flow the most effective peak reduction methods involve delaying discharge and attenuating surcharge storage the efficiency of lid facilities could be optimized by adjusting the height of berms the depth of storage layers and the conductivity of the soil layer in accordance with the amount of runoff that the lid facilities must deal with the selection of one lid mode over the others depends on the return period and duration of the rainfall permeable pavement is more effective in reducing the peak flow from rainfall of shorter durations regardless of the return period bioretention cells with a soil layer and a thicker storage layer are more effective in dealing with rainfall of longer durations in cases where an insufficient proportion of the total subcatchment area is covered by lid facilities remedial measures would not be able to reduce peak flow effectively in outflow hydrograph analysis the influence of subcatchments in the upstream portions of the main line and branch line was generally insubstantial until the onset of peak flow in other words the installation of lid facilities in those subcatchments would have little effect on the overall peak flow thus we would suggest the installation of fewer lid facilities in these subcatchments for example the influence of subcatchments near the downstream outlet was concentrated in the early stages of rainfall events such that the lid facilities in these areas tended to fill up quickly i e lose main functionality prior to peak flow onset thus the optimized spatial distribution involved the allocation of only a few lid facilities in those areas subcatchments in the midstream portion of the main line made their main contribution prior to peak flow onset thus those areas were assigned the greatest number of lid installations in the optimal configuration based on our results it appears that the expenditure of resources should be focused on subcatchments midstream along the main line particularly when the project is under budgetary constraints in lid planning we suggest using rainfall events of short duration to guide burden design and that lid facilities be concentrated in the midstream portion of the main line covering an area roughly equivalent to 30 of the subcatchment area downstream installations should be limited to roughly 20 of subcatchment area if lid facilities are deemed necessary in other areas then they should cover at least 5 of subcatchment area to have any effect when assessing viability for lid installation in areas with complex drainage or piping networks we suggest using unit outflow hydrographs to determine whether a particular subcatchment affects the overall outflow prior to peak flow onset declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

6271,this study employed swmm for simulations to elucidate physical mechanisms of lid components in site as well as coupled genetic algorithm with hydrological simulation to determine the optimal spatial configuration of lids in a watershed using main campus of ntu as a case study the results shows that the effectiveness of lid depends on storage capacity in delaying and attenuating discharge prior to the onset of peak inflow with enough surcharge storage control the discharge at the beginning of the rising limb the benefits of the lid s increased with the rainfall recurrence intervals a reversal of effect of peak reduction is observed when the surface storage space has been exhausted at the watershed scale the optimization results revealed that a higher ratio of lid installations in midstream subcatchments than in upstream and in downstream subcatchments hydrograph analysis also explained that installing lid facilities in subcatchments that make their primary contribution to outflow roughly simultaneously with the onset of peak flow is preferable in reducing peak flow at a watershed outlet the finding of this study could be useful to formulate watershed guidelines or strategies for the installation of decentralized flood reduction facilities keywords low impact development optimal spatial distributions genetic algorithm storm water management model hydrograph analysis storm peak reduction 1 introduction changes in hydrological and hydraulic conditions associated with urban development often increase the risk of flooding due largely to the installation of impermeable surfaces james 1965 leopold 1968 anderson 1970 hollis 1975 many existing urban flood control systems lack adequate drainage capacity to deal with the increased flooding brought about by climate change denault et al 2006 lienert et al 2013 unfortunately the installation of new storm drains and alterations to existing systems impose high construction costs arnbjerg nielsen and fleischer 2009 willems et al 2012 in many cases adding new drains is nearly impossible due to the fact the main pipes are situated beneath arterial roads grafton et al 2015 the social impact of modifying drainage systems actually much exceeds the construction costs in the past most drainage systems were centralized however planners have recently been considering decentralized point facilities e g low impact development lid which process storm water runoff close to the source numerous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of this approach to urban flooding booth and jackson 1997 niemczynowicz 1999 roy et al 2008 semadeni davies et al 2008 lid was first proposed in north america and new zealand in the 1980 s to deal with water quality issues it was later used to reduce surface runoff and peak flow during floods fletcher et al 2015 lid such as bioretention cells permeable pavement and green roofs make it possible to reduce flood peak and eliminate environmental problems associated with urban development askarizadeh et al 2015 fletcher et al 2015 vogel et al 2015 bhaskar et al 2016 although many urban managers engineers and policy makers see lid as an effective method to overcome the consequences of climate change and urban development most lid applications focus on the implementation of single facilities rather than a watershed wide approach consequently the effectiveness of lid under rainfall events of greater intensity and duration remains unclear previous studies have shown that lid can reduce the risk of flooding for example james and dymond 2011 zahmatkesh et al 2014 and ahiablame and shakya 2016 performed case studies on the effectiveness of lid schemes such as bioretention cells permeable paving and rain barrels in decreasing surface runoff or peak flow at downstream outlets their results demonstrated the effectiveness of lid in flood reduction under a variety of rainfall conditions they also showed that combining multiple types of lid is preferable to focusing on a single lid solution ahiablame and shakya 2016 in a comparison of lid solutions in terms of capital costs and runoff reduction joksimovic and alam 2014 found that vegetated swales present the lowest cost per unit volume of runoff reduction but they are far less effective in reducing peak discharge infiltration trenches and bioretention schemes are often the most effective of the solutions deemed economically feasible the influence of most lid facility related parameters such as lid size and installation area ratio have not been well elucidated nonetheless it has been shown that the rainfall recurrence and the retention volume of lid are important factors in flood control and the efficiency of runoff reduction measures lid reaches its reduction limit when the retention volume is filled gilroy and mccuen 2009 qin et al 2013 qin et al 2013 reported that swales are the most effective for rainfall with an early peak whereas permeable pavement is best suited to rainfall with a middle peak and green roofing is best suited for rainfall that peaks late lid is most effective when implemented to stagger peak discharge from different sewersheds gilroy and mccuen 2009 morsy et al 2016 used a numerical model to simulate outlet water levels and the surface runoff of rain gardens under various rainfall conditions they found that berm height rain garden area and diverted runoff i e the percentage of runoff produced by impervious areas diverted to rain gardens largely determine the effectiveness of rain gardens in preventing floods palla and gnecco 2015 pointed out that reduced runoff volume depends on the retention capacity of lid they also noted that hydrologic performance including peak reduction volume detention and hydrograph delay is linearly dependent on reducing the effective area that remains impervious to rainwater they also noted that peak flow decreases linearly with the length of the rainfall return period gilroy and mccuen 2009 conducted a similar study to determine the influence of rainfall recurrence on efforts to reduce flooding they postulated that the underlying mechanisms determine the flood reduction capacity of individual lid facilities whereas the spatial distribution of the facilities determines the effectiveness of multiple facilities operating in series unfortunately those studies did not closely investigate the physical mechanisms underlying lid which are crucial to understanding the capacity and limitations of such efforts most studies used computer simulations to investigate the impact of lid within a given watershed a number of software programs are available for numerical simulation and the analysis of lid jayasooriya and ng 2014 among these programs storm water management model swmm is recognized as one of the more sophisticated and comprehensive software packages for simulating the quality and quantity of water systems swmm is probably the most popular urban stormwater model today due to its ability to simulate the entire urban runoff system using robust surface runoff and bmp lid and flow routing algorithms rossman 2010 burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 fletcher et al 2013 zahmatkesh et al 2014 as discussed the spatial distribution of lid facilities strongly influences their effectiveness in flood reduction however the complexity of patterns in stormwater runoff in urban systems makes it difficult to determine their impact at the watershed scale mejía and moglen 2009 2010a b investigated the spatial distribution of impervious surfaces in urban areas they reported that effective impervious area spatial connectivity and the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall have a pronounced influence on hydrological responses at the catchment outlet however it remains unclear whether the benefits of extensive lid at the watershed level are sufficient to justify the costs mejía and moglen 2009 a number of studies have used optimization algorithms to compare the effectiveness of lid configurations at the watershed scale however these issues are not always considered from a hydrologic perspective zhang et al 2006 2013 used genetic algorithms gas to maximize the effects of bioretention cells permeable pavement and green roofs on runoff while minimizing costs similarly jia et al 2015 used the sustain model and a ga to optimize lid to reduce peak flow and deal effectively with pollutants while minimizing costs huang et al 2018 used a simulated annealing algorithm with the benefit cost ratio as an objective function to optimize eight lid components in the min sheng community of taipei city most previous studies promoted the large scale use of bioretention cells or green roofs due to their large storage capacity with support from permeable pavement huang et al 2018 also suggested installing these lid facilities in upstream subcatchments or areas of higher elevation damodaram and zechman 2012 divided north carolina state university campus into 60 subcatchments and then used a ga to optimize the configuration of permeable pavement and rainwater harvesting methods under strict budgetary constraints they found that detention ponds are particularly effective in reducing peak flow they also found that identical effects could be achieved by varying lid combinations and that flexibility increases with the size of the lid installation area cano and barkdoll 2016 used a multi objective optimization algorithm mosebend multi objective socio economic boundary emanating nearest distance to facilitate the selection of lid facilities with the aim of restoring runoff to natural values while minimizing costs they compared 20 scenarios involving the establishment of lid downstream to upstream and upstream to downstream their results revealed that implementing lid in steeper upstream areas was the most efficient approach in terms of the cost benefit ratio this contradicts the intuitive view that lid should be established midstream and downstream of catchments heuristic algorithms such as gas overcome the limitations of conventional computational schemes which are prone to local optimality traps moreover heuristic algorithms usually bypass complex calculation processes in obtaining a gradient thereby making it easier to solve problems with multiple variables and high nonlinearity in contrast to studies applying only one kind of heuristic optimization reichold et al 2009 adopted a hybrid approach in conjunction with local as well as global optimum search methods to derive spatial configurations for urban development in the catchment with the least impact on the environment this approach features high convergence speed provided by the nm method as well as the ability to escape local optima provided by the ga xu et al 2018 applied the marginal cost based greedy strategy mcgs to find the optimal solution of maximum flood reduction at minimum cost compared to a ga mcgs requires fewer iterations and also provides a larger number of alternatives and better solutions however this algorithm is very limited when dealing with complex environmental problems previous studies have elucidated the effects of lid however most researchers examined phenomena from a specific perspective and seldom presented a comprehensive evaluation of the underlying physical and or hydrological mechanisms to fill this gap this study employed swmm to examine the physical mechanisms of lid components in subcatchments we then extended the scope of our analysis to the watershed scale swmm was used in conjunction with a ga our primary objective was to minimize downstream peak flow in determining the optimal lid spatial distribution we also employed hydrological methods and considered the physical mechanisms of lid in our analysis this made it possible to formulate basic guidelines for the installation of decentralized flood reduction facilities within a given catchment based on the spatial and physical characteristics of lid 2 methodology reducing downstream peak flow through the installation of lids requires a watershed strategy informed by comprehensive knowledge of the underlying hydrological mechanisms it is important to know both how elements of the lid system deal with precipitation at the source and how runoff is redistributed within the watershed this study examined lid applications at these two different scales this information is essential for optimized design especially within strict budgetary constraints we utilized swmm one of the most popular rainfall runoff models used for urban water resource management to simulate the effect of lid facilities ga optimization was then coupled with hydrological simulation to determine the optimal spatial configuration of lids in a watershed 2 1 study area national taiwan university campus the study performed a case study of the main campus of ntu the main campus is located in the daan district of taipei city an important educational commercial residential and cultural area covering approximately 1 13 km2 the campus is enclosed by four arterial roads with major drains beneath therefore the campus can be considered an independent catchment ntu occupies a relatively small piece of land and data is available for the entire drainage system in this study we conducted hydrological and hydraulic analysis of far greater detail than that seen in previous studies the office of general affairs at ntu commissioned a comprehensive survey of the campus in order to establish a complete geographic information system gis as well as a database pertaining to all manholes and pipelines it is for this reason that this site was selected as our study area the drainage system on the ntu campus is divided into several independent blocks each of which has its own outlet as shown in fig 1 among the eight drainage systems a g block a is the most complex and covers the largest area unfortunately much of the pipeline data in block a is missing or unusable which could greatly hinder the representation of this system in swmm and would no doubt lead to discrepancies between simulations and reality thus we selected block b as the primary study area for analysis block b is roughly 0 2 km2 approximately a fifth of the ntu campus and the degree of complexity is similar to that seen in typical urban drainage systems 2 2 swmm simulation swmm was first developed by the environmental protection agency of the united states us epa in 1971 it provides wide functionality in the simulation of hydrological and hydraulic mechanisms such as rainfall runoff processes and urban system drainage this system has also been shown to outperform other schemes in terms of flow routing in underdrain networks lid components also been included in the software package since version 5 0 22 and many of the problems in earlier versions have been dealt with the current version of swmm used in this study was version 5 1 013 in this case study the setup of the swmm model was based on the ntu main campus drainage and pavement survey analysis and planning result report hereinafter referred to as the report compiled by shengyu engineering consulting co ltd as shown in fig 1 the report clearly delineates the eight major catchments of the campus the numerical model in our study area block b contained 30 subcatchments 33 conduits 33 junctions and one outfall these subcatchments also known as sewersheds are delineated in accordance with the buildings terrain pipeline direction and roads along the pipelines on the gis platform aerial images with 1 m resolution were used to identify impervious areas e g buildings and roads as well as pervious areas e g green spaces we then calculated the proportions of pervious and impervious areas in each delineated subcatchment and averaged the slope using data generated by digital elevation models dems the infiltration of water into the soil was calculated using horton s equation based on field soil condition a summary of model parameter settings is listed in table 1 the report provided the maximum depth of most of the manholes the elevation at the bottom of the junctions was obtained using arcgis by overlaying the location of a given junction on a dem to derive its surface elevation from which the maximum depths were subtracted and applied in the model administrators at ntu provided the length cross section shape and dimensions of the sewers as well as the inlet offset and outlet offset most of the sewer networks were constructed using reinforced concrete for which manning s coefficient was set at 0 015 the main direction of flow was toward xinhai road located on the northern side of ntu campus outflow at all boundaries was deemed free fall based on the difference in elevation the lid components used in this study included 1 the most common bioretention cells comprising a surface layer a soil layer a storage layer and an underdrain and 2 permeable pavement comprising a surface layer a pavement layer a storage layer and an underdrain under optional settings we stipulated that both types of component include drainage pipes in their water storage layers however the permeable pavement did not include a soil layer as a result rainfall runoff quickly infiltrated the pavement layer into the storage layer table 2 lists the parameter settings of the lid components 2 3 hydrological conditions many hydraulic facilities urban drainage systems in particular are designed for specific rainfall intensities however the fact that lid uses small retention detention facilities means that rainfall duration is also an important issue in exploring the functionality of lid systems during rainfall events we applied the official hyetographs designed for each rainfallscenario in northern taiwan water resources agency 2001 with six different return periods 2 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year events and six durations 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 9 h and 12 h the range of rainfall intensity was from 11 10 mm hr 12 h 2 year to 132 76 mm hr 1 h 100 year we sought to identify the mechanisms underlying retention and detention by which lid facilities reduce peak flooding by examining a number of hydrological variables including storage water levels infiltration rates soil water content inflow and outflow at various time points 2 4 optimization algorithm gas represent an iterative heuristic approach to dealing with optimization problems they enable convergence to a near global optimum through evolution while escaping local optima through the preservation of diversity in the offspring population via iterative mutation each iteration includes calculations to determine the adaptability of individual solutions to the objective function individual solutions are selected for breeding in a mating pool based on the roulette method the subsequent child generation undergoes random genetic mutations in accordance with a preset rate mutation values cover a larger range during the first stages of evolution to accelerate convergence and a smaller range during the final stages to prevent convergence failure in this study a ga was used to adjust lid design parameters in swmm with the aim of optimizing an objective function that considers budget limitations as well as physical constraints for example the upper limit of the overall area was the sum of the areas of each subcatchment which means that the lid facilities could cover no more than the area of subcatchments with a lower limit of 0 the optimization problem can be formulated as follows 1 max x p x subject to x l r t p 0 c x b 0 x i where x is a matrix of control variables including l the ratio of lid installation area to total watershed area r the ratio of bioretention to total lid installation area t the ratio of impervious area treated by lid and p the ratio of impervious area treated by bioretention to that treated by both lid facilities these variables range between 0 and 1 which can be dealt directly using a ga p x is the objective function i e peak flow reduction at the outlet of the entire watershed which could only be obtained using swmm simulation to assess various lid setups c x refers to the cost of installing lid and b is the budgetary constraint set to 50 million and 100 million ntd we adopted the penalty method in considering this constraint such that the objective function is reformulated as follows 2 max f x p x σ g x g x g x max 0 c x b 2 where g x is the penalty function and σ is the penalty coefficient our optimization algorithm was coded by the first author using python python is an object oriented programming language that uses simple syntax we employed the roulette selection function of the pyvolution 1 1 plug in extension for gas we coded the other parts manually because the pyvolution 1 1 data structure could not accommodate the complexity required for this study note that we also considered using the nonlinear programming algorithm broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs to formulate our optimization problem unlike heuristic algorithms such as gas bfgs is a quasi newtonian nonlinear programming scheme that uses a specific mathematical formula to estimate the gradients corresponding to different vectors second derivatives are used to calculate a hessian matrix as an optimization improvement mechanism thereby enabling the solutions to converge more quickly than would be possible using a heuristic algorithm many lid combinations actually produce almost identical effects and produce local optimums in the feasible region furthermore any adjustment to the variables has only a limited impact on peak flow at the downstream outlet due to the low resolution of the swmm results this makes the traditional nonlinear algorithm such as bfgs would be difficult to detect improvements within a given iteration and therefore become trapped in a local optimum consequently we opted for a ga instead of bfgs to deal with our lid optimization problem 3 results and discussions 3 1 effectiveness of single lid before examining lid installation strategies we simulated the performance of lid in a single sewershed under a variety of rainfall events our objective was to identify the physical mechanisms underlying lid performance which could then be used to examine the performance of installations in terms of the overall catchment the representative sewershed selected for this part of the study was a 1 3 ha area adjoining choushan road 56 35 of which was impervious the specifications of this representative sewershed are listed in table 3 a budget of ntd 1 million allowed for the installation of either 166 67 m2 of bioretention cell s or 333 33 m2 of permeable pavement covering the entire region of study we assumed that the installed facility would be capable of dealing with runoff from an impervious area approximately three times that of the installation we compared the performance of the two schemes in terms of reducing peak flow under 36 rainfall conditions based on a detailed reported generated by swmm fig 2 a and b compare the performance of two lid solutions bioretention cells and permeable pavement in terms of reducing peak flow in a single sewershed under rainfall events with a duration of 1 h the benefits of the bioretention cells increased with the intensity of the rainfall events from 0 022 m3 s 2 year event to 0 037 m3 s 50 year event interestingly for events with a return period exceeding 50 years the effects of the bioretention cells reversed which resulted in 0 035 m3 s for 100 year events a similar reversal was observed for rainfall events with a duration of 2 h wherein the most pronounced peak reduction was achieved when applied to rainfall events with a 5 year return period for rainfall events of longer duration the effectiveness of the bioretention cells was inversely proportional to the return period for rainfall events of 1 h duration the effectiveness of permeable pavement in reducing peak flow increased consistently with the return period from 0 041 m3 s 2 year events to 0 064 m3 s 100 year events for rainfall events of 2 h duration the effectiveness of permeable pavement decreased with the return period from 0 023 m3 s 2 year events to 0 016 m3 s 100 year events for rainfall events of longer durations the effects of the permeable pavement were the opposite of those seen in rainfall events of 1 h duration we then increased the area of the installed lid facility by three times and kept all other settings constant including the amount of runoff treated by the installed facility the capacity of the storage space underground and surface increased proportionally to the area therefore the capacity of the lid facility in this case exceeded that in previous cases the results in fig 2 c and d revealed that under these conditions the lid was somewhat effective in reducing peak flow regardless of the rainfall conditions in fact the lid even proved effective against rainfall of extended durations we also observed that with an increase in storage space the severity of events that would induce turnaround increased from those with 1 h 50 year and 2 h 5 year return period to those with a 3 h 50 year return period this means that the degree to which lid can reduce peak flow is proportional to the availability of storage space we also observed reductions in peak flow under rainfall durations of 6 h 9 h and 12 h the effects of which increased with the length of the return period understanding the limitations of lid facilities and maximizing their effectiveness is crucial in real world applications detailed reports of lid from swmm help to elucidate the underlying mechanism s the output results in the detailed reports were converted into unit area which can be viewed as a process of non dimensionalizing area variables with different installation areas fig 3 presents the data extracted from swmm which was used to characterize the performance of bioretention cells when applied to 1 h and 2 h rainfall events with various return periods we also added three auxiliary lines to the graphs the green horizontal dotted line shows the water storage limit based on a given berm height of 150 mm the black horizontal dotted line indicates the depth between the underdrain pipes in the storage layer and the bottom of the storage layer 250 mm the red vertical dotted line indicates the time point corresponding to maximum inflow lid facilities are designed to reduce peak discharge runoff by compensating for losses of rainfall abstraction and an increase in the time of concentration the maximum rate of percolation into the storage layer created by bioretention cells is 50 mm h which is primarily determined by the soil layer in simulation scenarios the rainfall intensity can be very high e g peaking at 154 mm h for 2 year 1 h events or even 324 mm h for 100 year 1 h events and inflow due to discharge from impervious areas can also be high this means there would not be enough time for water to percolate into the bottom storage layer particularly during intense rainfall events of short duration when the surface soil becomes saturated ponding water accumulates within the surface storage space until it reaches the height of the berm thus when faced with intense rainfall events of short duration most of the reduction in peak flow due to bioretention cells can be attributed to surface storage above the soil layer rather than the bottom storage layer the function of bioretention cells is similar to that of small detention ponds as long as the surface water level does not reach the height of the berm before the onset of peak inflow then storage space remains and no surface runoff flows out from this site as shown in the results of 2 5 and 10 year events in fig 3 a the remaining capacity within the berm increases the degree to which peak flow can be reduced under 25 50 and 100 year events the surface water level exceeded the height of the berm prior to the onset of peak inflow as indicated by the dashed pink line in the figure this indicates that the surface storage space was exhausted and the discharge of surface runoff had already begun red solid line at the onset of peak inflow in this case attenuation involves the temporary storage of surface water and a delay inpeak discharge however this effect diminishes with an increase in inflow which leads to more water storage and accelerates flood peak propagation in the lid facility the peak discharge is delayed by approximately 9 min 7 min and 6 min for 25 year 50 year and 100 year rainfall events of 1 h durations respectively rainfall of higher intensity exhausts lid storage more rapidly and induces discharge sooner bioretention cells were shown to have the most pronounced effect on events with a return period of 25 years as shown in fig 3 b this situation is similar to that of rainfall events with a 2 h duration regardless of the return period when facing an event with a 2 year return period bioretention cells are able to retain all of the water up to the onset of peak flow when facing an event with a 5 year return period the storage capacity of bioretention cells is rapidly exhausted but the effects of peak flow are attenuated by the provision of temporary storage which can greatly reduce the effects of flooding as the intensity of events increases as represented by an increase in return period the level of the surface water responds more rapidly in response to changes in inflow thereby reducing the degree to which discharge is delayed for 50 and 100 year events there is essentially no lag between changes in inflow and the discharge of surface runoff which means that no surcharge storage is available to accommodate peak flow and thereby delay outflow the storage layer of permeable pavement is thinner than that of bioretention cells furthermore the underdrain pipes are above the bottom of the storage layer 200 mm in this case the relatively high hydraulic conductivity of the permeable pavement material allows the passage of rainfall into the storage layer in most cases permeable pavement does not have a middle soil layer which would otherwise hinder infiltration into the storage layer with the result that storage capacity is rapidly exhausted furthermore permeable pavement does not usually have extruding berms so it can only deal with runoff via temporary surcharge storage fig 4 a presents the characteristics of permeable pavement under the effects of a 1 h rainfall event note that the cost of permeable pavement is half that of bioretention cells therefore for a given budget permeable pavement could be applied to an area of double the size with presumably two times the overall effect as shown in fig 4 a there would be sufficient storage space beneath the permeable pavement to provide an effective buffer against a 1 h rainfall event with 2 year return period even though the available storage is exhausted permeable pavement would still be more effective in reducing peak flow during 5 year events than during a 2 year event due to the fact that there was little discharge at the beginning of the rising limb of outflow nonetheless the enormous volume of water that falls during 5 year to 100 year events rapidly exhausts the capacity of the storage layer leaving only surface storage space as with bioretention surface storage attenuation is the primary mechanism in peak flow reduction in this study permeable pavement covered more area than do bioretention installations for a given budget therefore outflow discharge in paved areas was less sensitive to inflow of the same magnitude as a result the attenuation of discharge is more effective when there is a longer peak delay when facing a rainfall event with a return period of more than 100 years maximum peak attenuation could occur within one hour similarly the underground storage required for peak inflow could be exhausted within 2 h regardless of the rainfall intensity i e event return period this means that surface storage attenuation the effects of which are less pronounced under storms of greater intensity serves as the primary mechanism affecting a reduction in peak flow permeable pavement could only be expected to attenuate the peak flow associated with 1 h events our results indicate that both bioretention and permeable pavement function optimally when the flow is attenuated using temporary surcharge storage in addition to the conventional approach of compensating for losses and postponing the occurrence of discharge discharge from lid facilities increases at 5 2 power of the flow depth manning s formula and the depth of the water responds linearly on the amount of inflow this means that maximum peak reduction occurs at a specific depth satisfying the first order condition at which the increasing the peak inflow would not lead to a situation in which incremental runoff discharge exceeds inflow the water depth leading that would most effectively reduce peak flow varies with rainfall pattern and the characteristics of the lid as shown in fig 5 bioretention would be the most effective solution when faced with 23 year 1 h rainfall events the effects of lid in reducing peak flow under rainfall of 1 h duration would be reversed when dealing with storms of greater intensity greater than23 year return period thus that turnaround in fig 2 a occurs at 25 year 1 hr which is the closest point to 23 year 1 hr in our simulations the peak flow attenuation provided by permeable pavement would not diminish despite an increase in the intensity of events with a duration of 1 h as a result it is likely that permeable pavement would be most effective solution for rainfall events with a return period of more than 100 years when facing 2 h rainfall events bioretention could be expected to function continuously by allowing water to percolate into underneath storage this would make it the most effective solution for rainfall events with a return period of 2 to 5 years in contrast the performance of permeable pavement diminishes with an increase in rainfall intensity i e longer return period for lid implementations with higher capacity compensating for abstraction loss and attenuating peak flow would both help to deal with the inundation that comes with rainfall events of greater intensity and or longer duration detailed reports from swmm again demonstrate that runoff storage capacity is the primary factor influencing the effectiveness of lid measures chui et al 2016 used sensitive analysis to identify the factors with the greatest influence on the effectiveness of lid they concluded that the conductivity of the soil layer is the most important parameter for bioretention cells and permeable pavement only if the hydraulic conductivity were low and or design storm were large would the berm height have an effect in reducing peak runoff rainfall in taiwan is far higher than in most other areas of the world and hydraulic conductivity is relatively low under these conditions berm height is the most important factor this may explain why our results differ slightly from those of chui et al 2016 despite the fact that there was generally agreement between the two studies only solutions that delay discharge and attenuate peak flow can be fully effective ideally storage capacity would be exhausted within a suitable period of time i e runoff would start at the beginning of the rising limb these observations indicate that shorter rainfall events 1 3 h could be most effectively dealt with by installing permeable pavement permeable pavement does not have a soil layer to control inflow rate which means that it is able to absorb large amounts of surface runoff very quickly it also has a low cost per unit area which allows the conversion of large areas bioretention cells are preferable for rainfall events of longer duration 6 12 h these feature a soil layer that controls the amount of water that enters the storage layer the depth of the storage layer also allows for the storage of runoff produced in the early stages of the rainfall event thereby reserving surface storage space for the later stages nonetheless neither of the proposed methods are able to reduce peak flows for rainfall of longer durations or higher intensities the change in the turnaround of peak flow reduction effects can be attributed to the fact that the effectiveness of lid facilities in reducing peak flow under the rainfall patterns of taiwan depends on the availability and attenuation of surface storage space at the time of peak flow onset preventing the premature exhaustion of surface storage space requires the absorption of water by underground storage layers the arrival of peak flow generally coincides with high rainfall intensity and high inflow from runoff only when infiltration is too slow to keep up with rainfall does surface storage provided by berms and surcharge storage assume the burden thus the effectiveness of lid solutions in reducing peak flow depends on whether the depth of underground storage layers the height of the underdrain pipe the conductivity of the soil layer and the height of the berm are sufficient to attenuate the expected peak flow thus there is a clear need for methods by which to control inflow and outflow rates to enable the rapid absorption of water without prematurely exhausting storage capacity i e not before the onset of peak flow swmm reports provide considerable insight into the effectiveness of lid solutions however swmm standardizes the model to ensure applicability to a wide range of situations failing to consider all of the functions of lid components the first issue is outflow from the lid facility in real world lid implementations outlets are commonly given small openings in order to control water flow unfortunately the lid components in swmm do not allow for the adjustment of outlets from the surface layer routing subcatchment runoff is simulated by the kinematic wave procedure which employs the unit width approach based on a rectangular plane with a preselected width thus in swmm simulations the width and length of lid components are crucial parameters affecting retention performance and peak flow if the time required for water to pass through the lid system were overestimated then the time at which the runoff flows out of the lid component would be brought forward rather than delayed it is even possible for lid outflow to overlap and thereby increase the peak outflow of the subcatchment into the junction this is precisely opposite to the desired effect which cannot be simulated effectively with swmm if the time required for water to pass through the lid system were underestimated then the proposed lid solution would have retention performance superior to that reflected in the simulation in swmm the installation of lid facilities results in the replacement of impervious areas of a given width rain falling on the remaining impervious areas is unilaterally diverted to lid components based on the percentage of impervious area that they cover we suggest adjusting the width of lid components based on the concept of an equivalent rectangular cascading plane in order to bring the length of the lid component in line with the actual flow path rather than the actual length another approach to resolving this problem involves dividing each subcatchment into three subcatchments respectively containing the impervious areas pervious areas and lid installation areas this approach makes it possible to more correctly present the time at which runoff passes impervious areas weir components could also be installed to control lid inflows and outflows in order to bring them in line with the intended flow control imposed by actual inlets and outlets however it would impose a massive increase in labor and computational overhead because any adjustment to the area of the lid installation would necessitate adjustments to all three areas another issue is the fact that swmm simulates the flow unilaterally rather than bilaterally from one component to another this simplification omits two dimensional overland calculations with the result that water would accumulate to form ponds in the area directly above the lid even if there was no berm at the surface ponding or inundation to a depth of 30 cm would no doubt flow outward into neighboring areas while simulations in swmm may not which would be entirely unreasonable based on calculations using the manning formula we determined that outflow over lid components due to surface flooding is proportional to the width of the outflow from lid components the resulting overestimates pertaining to the depth and volume of surface surcharge storage would lead to overestimates pertaining to the reductions in peak flow provided by lid 3 2 optimizing lid at the watershed scale another objective of this study was to determine the optimal spatial distribution of lid in terms of area assuming that all lid components are configured similarly the objective of these efforts was to enable a comparison of scenarios under various budgetary constraints we also conducted analysis on the optimal spatial distributions under 36 rainfall conditions with limited budgets of ntd 50 or 100 million our results were compiled as a box and whisker plot with the numbers of the 30 subcatchments on the horizontal axis and the area or proportion of lid installation on the vertical axis fig 6 the top and bottom ends of the whiskers respectively indicate the maximum and minimum values whereas the tops and bottoms of the boxes represent the third 75 and first 25 quartiles the black lines in the middle of the boxes represent the second quartile 50 which is also the median the arithmetic means are marked with a blue rhombus we indicated the proportions of the original impervious areas in the subcatchments using green dots specific peak flow reduction effects could be achieved using any number of lid implementations that differ in spatial distribution resulting in various interquartile ranges our optimization results revealed that the lid facilities accessible within this budget could be effective in reducing peak flow under most rainfall conditions the optimization variables used in this analysis included lid installation area and the percentage of impervious area undergoing treatment table 4 shows that the most pronounced decreases in peak flow were for 100 year 1 h rainfall events as follows 4 646 m3 s i e 44 8 reduction in peak flow with ntd 50 million budget and 5 917 m3 s i e 57 6 reduction in peak flow with ntd 100 million budget the least pronounced decreases in peak flow in terms of magnitude were for 2 year 12 h rainfall events as follows 0 131 m3 s ntd 100 million budget and 0 283 m3 s ntd 50 million budget the least pronounced reductions in peak flow in terms of percentage were for a 100 year 12 h rainfall event as follows 4 5 and 11 3 the above results are in good agreement with our results obtained from lid characteristic analysis the situation examined in this study included adequate storage space therefore lid would be highly effective in reducing peak flow under rainfall events of shorter durations the decrease in peak flow would become increasingly pronounced with an increase in rainfall intensity however the effects would become less pronounced with an increase in rainfall duration in addition the reduction ratio may be too low for events of long duration and higher intensity the optimal spatial distribution under the various rainfall conditions varied in accordance with the intensity and duration of the rainfall we divided the study area into five zones as shown in fig 7 table 5 shows the proportions and locations of the various lid installations under this scheme zone i subcatchments b12 b15 was located in the upstream portion of the main line and included the lowest proportion of lid installations zone ii subcatchments b16 b20 and zone iv subcatchments b28 b38 were located in the midstream portion of the main line and included the highest proportions of lid installations similar to zone i zone iii subcatchments b21 b27 was situated in the upstream portion of a branch line and included a similar proportion of lid installations in terms of the median value although its mean was far lower than those of zones ii and iv nonetheless it is a feature of optimal lid spatial distributions that a few extreme values under specific rainfall conditions would be high enough for the mean to exceed the median thus it is appropriate to use the median for comparison and analysis zone v subcatchments b39 b44 was closest to the outlet and included a moderate proportion of lid installations comparing to our results hwang et al 2017 and sohn et al 2017 demonstrated that the spatial distribution of directly connected impervious area dcia influences the volume of peak flow and runoff they suggested installing lid in areas of higher dcia concentration regarding the location of lid in watershed further suggestion or explanation were not clearly identified in these studies this study confirmed the ratio of impervious area is related to the ratio of lid installed area in most cases nonetheless the distance to the outlet could be more strongly correlated with lid installations we were concerned that there may be a relationship linking the distances among subcatchments and outfall and the area covered by lid installations we first set outfall b as the origin in calculating the flow distance between this point and the outlet of each subcatchment fig 8 was then plotted with this distance set as an independent variable and the area covered by installations and the ratio of lid installations as dependent variables since the areas of each sewersheds differ the ratio of lid installations and the distance to outfall b see fig 8 b provides a more reasonable interpretation we can see that the results fit well with a second order curve further we can see that the ratio of lid installations in midstream subcatchments was higher than in upstream and in downstream subcatchments we conducted more thorough analysis using fixed durations paired with variable return periods and fixed return periods paired with variable durations in the following we consider only the situation involving a budget of ntd 100 million however the results would be similar under different budgetary constraints as shown in fig 9 the patterns in lid installation proportions under shorter rainfall durations 1 2 and 3 h were roughly identical to those obtained in the overall analysis in contrast the patterns obtained under longer rainfall durations 6 9 and 12 h were irregular and presented no similarities this can be attributed to variations in the effectiveness of lid installations in reducing peak flow under various rainfall conditions when faced with rainfall of longer durations there is a lack of adequate storage space to mediate flow even before peak flow onset in this situation most of the lid facilities are rendered ineffective which means that no spatial configuration would be able to reduce the peak flow at the downstream outlet resulting in the scattered appearance of the lid installation proportions we also fixed return periods to show changes in lid distribution under rainfall events of various durations as shown in fig 10 the proportions of the various lid installations differed considerably no particular trend was observed for 2 year events however as the length of the return period increased the proportion of lid installations moved closer to the overall analysis results obtained under the 36 rainfall conditions this is in complete opposition to the analysis involving fixed durations and variable return periods the lid facilities were highly effective when facing 2 year and 5 year events regardless of rainfall duration and were therefore able to reduce peak flow in most of the spatial configurations the patterns of lid installations in the optimized results were extremely scattered i e a higher proportion of installation in some of the subcatchments when facing 2 year and 5 year events but a lower proportion in the same subcatchments when facing longer return periods moreover we observed an increase in the difference between the mean and median proportion of lid installations in subcatchments b21 b27 as the length of the return period increased i e rainfall intensity became increasingly severe the importance of lid spatial distribution became increasingly evident when facing 100 year events it would be preferable to have lid facilities extremely concentrated in zones ii iv and v with almost no installations in zones i and iii 3 3 hydrograph analysis a number of studies have applied ga based optimization to lid installations however they provided little or no explanation as to the means by which spatial distribution could be used to enhance the effectiveness of efforts to reduce peak flow in this study we conducted hydrograph analysis to elucidate the mechanisms operant under the various lid spatial distributions based on the concept of unit hydrographs and the contribution of each subcatchment to the overall outflow hydrograph we calculated the s hydrograph of each subcatchment under rainfall intensity of 10 mm h over a period of 120 min this made it possible to characterize the impact of each subcatchment on outflow within the context of the optimization results hydrograph analysis was conducted by eliminating one subcatchment and then comparing the results with those obtained under the original conditions the contribution made by the subcatchment that was eliminated was the difference between the two results we repeated the elimination of one subcatchment in each step until we derived the contribution of all of the subcatchments in terms of outflow fig 11 in fig 11 the black vertical dotted line indicates the time at which peak flow occurred at the outlet of the watershed we also applied the nelder mead optimization algorithm to select the time interval with the highest correlation coefficient between the ratio of lid installations and the ratio of outflow volume within this interval compared to that of the entire period as can be seen peak flow onset occurred at 139 min selecting a time interval between 93 min and 194 min red dotted lines in fig 11 provided the highest correlation coefficient of 0 534 this could be used as a rule of thumb for any watershed that contributes more to the peak outflow of the entire basin in these situations increasing the area covered by lid facilities would be a more efficient approach to reducing peak flow in the entire basin in our case study the peak outflow of this subcatchment was roughly between 45 and 55 min before and after the onset of peak flow our objective in installing lid facilities was to reduce peak flow at the downstream outlet similarly eckart et al 2018 used multiobjective optimization to obtain cost effectiveness curves of lid with the aim of reducing volume during peak flow they reported that it would be better to install lid in high runoff areas however their results do not bear this out establishing lid in areas of high runoff appears to be an obvious solution however we posit that the location and distance to the outlet are even more important this can be explained by the fact that any attempt to attenuate peak flow at the outlet must consider runoff as well as the lag time in that particular catchment looking only at the hydrological characteristics we can see that most of the subcatchments that make their main contribution to outflow after the onset peak flow are located in the upstream portion of the subcatchments e g b12 and b14 in these subcatchments no efforts to reduce peak flow would be particularly effective rather lid facilities should be concentrated in subcatchments that make a meaningful contribution during the target time interval we also looked at the physical mechanisms underlying the functionality of lid facilities the ability of lid facility to reduce peak flow depends on access to and the size of the underground storage layer as well as the availability of surface storage space i e a certain amount of storage space must remain available prior to the onset of peak flow our investigation of hydrological characteristics and the underlying physical mechanisms revealed that it is preferable to install lid facilities in subcatchments that make their primary contribution to outflow roughly simultaneously with the onset of peak flow lid facilities in subcatchments with higher early outflow e g b44 b43 and b41 are limited in the degree to which they are able to reduce peak flow due simply to the fact that their storage capacities are exhausted more rapidly installing lid facilities in these subcatchments would not be an appropriate allocation of resources 4 conclusions in this study we implemented simulations of single subcatchments to elucidate the physical mechanisms by which lid facilities reduce peak flow from rainfall the effectiveness of bioretention cells and permeable pavement depends on storage capacity at the onset of peak flow the most effective peak reduction methods involve delaying discharge and attenuating surcharge storage the efficiency of lid facilities could be optimized by adjusting the height of berms the depth of storage layers and the conductivity of the soil layer in accordance with the amount of runoff that the lid facilities must deal with the selection of one lid mode over the others depends on the return period and duration of the rainfall permeable pavement is more effective in reducing the peak flow from rainfall of shorter durations regardless of the return period bioretention cells with a soil layer and a thicker storage layer are more effective in dealing with rainfall of longer durations in cases where an insufficient proportion of the total subcatchment area is covered by lid facilities remedial measures would not be able to reduce peak flow effectively in outflow hydrograph analysis the influence of subcatchments in the upstream portions of the main line and branch line was generally insubstantial until the onset of peak flow in other words the installation of lid facilities in those subcatchments would have little effect on the overall peak flow thus we would suggest the installation of fewer lid facilities in these subcatchments for example the influence of subcatchments near the downstream outlet was concentrated in the early stages of rainfall events such that the lid facilities in these areas tended to fill up quickly i e lose main functionality prior to peak flow onset thus the optimized spatial distribution involved the allocation of only a few lid facilities in those areas subcatchments in the midstream portion of the main line made their main contribution prior to peak flow onset thus those areas were assigned the greatest number of lid installations in the optimal configuration based on our results it appears that the expenditure of resources should be focused on subcatchments midstream along the main line particularly when the project is under budgetary constraints in lid planning we suggest using rainfall events of short duration to guide burden design and that lid facilities be concentrated in the midstream portion of the main line covering an area roughly equivalent to 30 of the subcatchment area downstream installations should be limited to roughly 20 of subcatchment area if lid facilities are deemed necessary in other areas then they should cover at least 5 of subcatchment area to have any effect when assessing viability for lid installation in areas with complex drainage or piping networks we suggest using unit outflow hydrographs to determine whether a particular subcatchment affects the overall outflow prior to peak flow onset declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

drinking water reservoirs and the variability of cdom properties along trophic gradients in these aquatic systems a total of 536 water samples were collected between 2015 and 2017 from 131 reservoirs

environmental pollution from anthropogenic activity by lighting and turbidity conditions and by the quantity and quality of organic matter present in the water body dunalska 2009 collection of all these data can be costly and time consuming therefore there is an urgent need to develop an alternative method to assess the trophic state of water reservoirs using parameters that can be retrieved from optical characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom plays an important role in the ecology of aquatic systems a high concentration of organic matter in natural waters is generally an indicator of pollution and potential for hypoxia zhao et al 2016 therefore knowledge of the sources composition and transformation of cdom would further our ability to monitor and protect the ecological integrity of aquatic systems the fluorescent cdom fdom has been widely used to trace cdom sources distribution and composition zhang et al 2009 2010 in that regard eem excitation emission matrix coupled with fluorescence regional integration fri eem has been a promising quantitative technique that is based on wavelength dependent paired fluorescence intensity data to define eem regions and each integrated fluorescence intensity region represents a specific fdom component chen et al 2003 zhao et al 2017 the development of more sensors related to cdom fluorescence can facilitate the adoption of fri eem techniques for monitoring of freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2014 lee et al 2015 bowling et al 2016 therefore models can be developed to assess the trophic state of freshwater systems using cdom fluorescence this would lead to comprehensive and regular monitoring of water quality in terms of both light condition and nutrients and ultimately more effective reservoirs management according to a national monitoring of reservoirs conducted in 2015 9 8 67 2 19 7 and 3 3 of the reservoirs in china were found to be oligotrophic mesotrophic light eutrophic and mid eutrophic respectively some studies have proposed to assess trophic state using the nutrient color paradigm an approach largely based on cdom absorption and total organic matter webster et al 2008 dunalska 2011 however even though fdom is a significant part of cdom no linkage between fdom properties and the trophic state has been established for reservoirs in previous studies therefore the main objectives of this study were to 1 assess cdom absorption and fluorescence properties and composition changes along trophic gradients from oligotrophic to eutrophic in freshwater reservoirs 2 develop relationships between cdom properties and trophic state index tsim of the reservoirs 3 examine relationships between cdom fluorescence and altitude water chemical parameters and socio economic factors and 4 discuss potential applications of the fri eem model for assessing and monitoring the trophic state of reservoirs using cdom fluorescence data 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling a total of 131 reservoirs were selected across china to characterize fdom features fig 1 in total 536 water samples were collected mainly between 2015 and 2017 in the northeast part of china 192 samples were taken from late august 2015 and august 2016 field campaign was carried out in the eastern part of china and yungui region of china in october 2015 and 262 samples were collected from 56 reservoirs for the inner mongolia region 55 samples were taken in early august of 2015 there were 27 samples taken from the tibetan plateau region during the late of july in 2015 and 2017 during water sampling geographical coordinates and altitude of each sampling point were recorded with a gps receiver several water quality parameters were measured in situ including ph salinity water

stored in 1 l acid cleaned plastic bottles held on ice packs and transported to the laboratory as soon as possible in the laboratory water samples were stored at 4 c in a refrigerator and analyzed within 2 days 2 2 water quality measurements water samples were analyzed for doc concentration on a shimadzu toc analyzer 680 c in the laboratory total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined spectrophotometrically after digestion of the samples with alkaline potassium persulfate clesceri et al 1998 chlorophyll a chla concentration was obtained through extraction of a filtered sample 0 45 µm whatman gf f with acetone solution 90 and measured with a shimazdu uv 2600 pc spectrophotometer jeffrey humphrey 1975 total suspended matter tsm was measured gravimetrically as described in zhao et al 2016 2 3 cdom absorption measurements and indices in the laboratory water samples were filtered through a 0 7 µm pre combusted whatman gf f filter and then through a 0 22 µm millipore membrane cellulose filter cdom absorption spectra were determined using a shimadzu uv 2600pc uv vis spectrophotometer fitted with a 1 cm quartz cuvette in the spectral region from 200 to 800 nm 1 nm interval cdom spectra for milli q water were used as a reference the cdom absorption coefficient a λ was computed according to eq 1 1 a λ 2 303 a λ l where l is the cuvette length m and a λ

bricaud et al 1995 babin et al 2003 in this study the absorption coefficient a cdom 254 was used as a proxy for cdom relative concentration s is calculated by fitting a linear model to the data over a wavelength range of 275 to 295 nm with eq 2 the slope at the range of 275 295 nm s275 295 was used to characterize the cdom composition and infer its sources helms et al 2008 specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 defined as the absorbance at 254 nm divided by the doc concentration mg l was used as an index of dom aromaticity with high values of suva254 indicating dom with a high aromatic content and low values indicating dom with a low aromatic content weishaar et al 2003 the ratio m of cdom absorption coefficient at 250 nm and absorption coefficient at 365 nm m acdom250 acdom365 reflects the relative molecular weight of the humic component of dom with decreased m indicating increased molecular size of cdom jones et al 1988 2 4 cdom fluorescence measurement and fri analysis cdom fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were measured using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a 700 v xenon lamp the excitation ex and emission em scanning ranges were 200 450 nm and 250 500 nm respectively the spectra were recorded at a scan rate of 2400 nm min 1 using excitation and emission slit bandwidths of 5 nm eems of milli q water blanks were subtracted to eliminate the water raman scatter the elimination of the inner filter effect was performed by adjusting for cdom absorbance at the corresponding wavelengths according to eq 2 mcknight et al 2001 kothawala et al 2014 interpolation was used to remove the effect of rayleigh scattering stedmon and bro 2008 3 q cor q obs 10 a ex a em 2 where qobs and qcor represent fluorescence intensity of eems before and after calibration respectively the a ex and a em represent corrected absorbance at the corresponding excitation and emission wavelengths respectively the fluorescence was normalized to the

wavelength independent fluorescence intensity data based on eem spectra chen et al 2003 sun and mopper 2016 eem maps were divided into five regions q1 ex 200 250 nm em 250 330 nm tyrosine like protein

the percentage of fluorescence response in a specific region pi 1 2 3 4 5 was calculated as following 5 p i q i q t 100 2 5 index of trophic state the trophic state assessment of reservoirs was based on the modified carlson s trophic state index tsim aizaki 1981 this index was calculated using the three limnological parameters of chlorophyll a chla μg l secchi disk depth sdd m and total phosphorus

536 based on tsim values from low to high according to the ranking order of the sampling one sample was extracted at each of the two samples interval the extracted 1 3 samples were used for model validation while the others for model calibration the correlation analysis between tsim and hix was implemented the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and percentage root mean square error rmse between the measured and predicted values were calculated to assess goodness of fit and validation accuracy the rmse and rmse were determined using eqs 10 and 11 n is the number of samples the index of agreement d was to reflect the degree to which the measured variate was accurately estimated by the simulated variate the index of agreement d was determined using eq 12 with pi

significant when p 0 05 mapping of sampling sites was conducted using arcgis 10 1 environmental systems research institute redlands ca 3 results 3 1 biogeochemical characteristics and trophic state the sampled reservoirs had a wide range of trophic status as illustrated by the variations in nutrients and chla table 1 the average concentration of doc sdd chla and tn tp in the eutrophic reservoirs was noticeably higher than in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs table 1 the difference in doc concentration and other water chemical parameters among reservoirs of different trophic status was statistically significant p 0 001 among the three trophic states of reservoirs mean doc concentration ranged from 1 56 to 7 17 mg l 1 similarly the mean tp and tn concentration exhibited significant trophic variability ranging from 0 03 to 0 15 mg p l 1 and 0 91 to 2 98 mg n l 1 respectively table 1 the range for chla concentration was 1 02 to 46 62 µg l 1 for all reservoirs the differences of tn tp chla and sdd among the three trophic gradients of reservoirs were all significant p 0 01 the trophic states index tsim covered a wide range from 12 to 78 in total our dataset included reservoirs with a wide range of trophic states again suggesting that the data collected encompass conditions likely to be found in water reservoirs across china 3 2 cdom absorption and fdom characteristics 3 2 1 cdom characteristics the a cdom 254 ranged from 2 21 m 1 to 91 29 m 1 among the sampled reservoirs and the mean a cdom 254 showed an increasing trend from oligotrophic mesotrophic to eutrophic reservoirs respectively fig 2 table s1 the a cdom 254 values were significantly different among reservoirs of different trophic status p 0 01 the mean s275 295 for oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic reservoirs was 27 2 µm 20 6 um and 20 1 µm respectively fig 2 the suva254 ranged from 2 98 to 4 60 l mg m fig 2 the mean value of m related to the molecular weight of humic materials decreased from 16 13 to 6 92 with increasing trophic state p 0 01 from oligotrophic to mesotrophic s275 295 increased significantly p 0 01 while from mesotrophic to eutrophic status s275 295 was nearly invariant a similar but inverse trend was found with regard to suva254 table s1 the significant changes from oligotrophic to mesotrophic and slight changes of s275 295 m and suva254 from mesotrophic to eutrophic indicated that in the oligotrophic reservoirs cdom was predominantly derived from autochthonous sources while the mesotrophic and eutrophic reservoirs have relatively high proportions of cdom derived from allochthonous sources and exhibiting large molecular weight 3 2 2 fri fdom components in this study the fri based eems in different trophic reservoirs of china were analyzed to document trends in cdom fluorescence characteristics about trophic status the excitation emission area volumes q i and pi i 1 2 3 4 and 5 were proportional to the total fluorescence intensity and the relative contribution of the five different components to the total fluorescence intensity the examples of eem fluorescence spectra from yamdrok lake oligotrophic xiaolangdi reservoir mesotrophic hamatong reservoir eutrophic and xiashan reservoir hyper eutrophic were selected as representative of reservoirs in various trophic gradients and the partition of the five fluorescence components based on fri eem are shown in fig 3 the total fluorescence intensity qt ranged from 5 48 1010 nm to 4 51 1012 nm for all water samples and the mean qt from oligotrophic mesotrophic to eutrophic status was 1 32 1011 nm 2 64 1011 nm and 6 04 1011 respectively fig 4 a the relative contribution of individual components to total fluorescence intensity differed among water reservoirs of different trophic status fig 4b it was found that the q5 humic like and q3 fulvic like compounds were predominant in fdom for all types of reservoirs with increased trophic status the percentage of q1 and q4 decreased while the percentage of q3 and q5 increased significantly p 0 01 the mean humification index hix from oligotrophic mesotrophic to eutrophic reservoirs was in the order of 3 26 8 08 and 8 76 fig 4c 3 3 cdom optical properties versus social and biogeochemical factors the cdom absorption coefficient at 254 nm showed a strong correlation with tn r 0 93 p 0 05 table 2 while there were weak correlations between cdom absorption and chla or tp p 0 05 tn tp cultivated land area and gdp all showed positive correlations with allochthonous cdom fluorescent components q3 and q5 p 0 05 t test table 2 however chla sewage discharge agricultural fertilizer and pesticide use and urban population size had close relationships with autochthonous cdom fluorescent components q2 and q4 p 0 05 t test table 2 the relationships between dem and cdom absorption and fdom were all significant p 0 01 fig 5 according to data obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn solar radiation increased significantly with altitude r2 0 41 p 0 01 fig 5b although sunlight duration also arises with altitude the relationship was weak r2 0 18 p 0 01 fig 5c nevertheless s275 295 increased significantly p 0 01 with elevation suggesting photo degradation could be an important process in the high altitude reservoirs fig 5d 3 4 cdom optical properties versus trophic states there were weak relationships between individual tsi parameters tsi chla tsitp tsisdd and cdom absorption p 0 05 but the synthetic tsim showed a significant relationship with cdom absorption r2 0 60 p 0 01 which suggested that cdom absorption coefficients at 254 nm could be considered a potential indicator to evaluate the trophic status of reservoirs the exponential regression equations between tsim and allochthonous cdom fluorescent components q3 and q5 were obtained with a relative moderate coefficient q3 r2 0 48 p 0 01 q5 r2 0 45 p 0 01 fig 6 b c the tsim was negatively affected by cdom absorption slope r 0 21 p 0 01 in contrast suva254 increased as the tsim increased r 0 19 p 0 01 table 3 an important result of the present study is the significant correlations between tsim and hix coefficient of determination of 0 67 across chinese reservoirs this calibration model was applied to the remaining water samples for validation the validation result is presented in fig 7 the rmse was 9 86 and the rmse value of 4 73 and d is 0 92 given these relationships fig 6d and fig 7 we proposed a new classification whereby cdom humification index can be used as a proxy for tsim table 4 the proposed classification would be as follows oligotrophic state corresponding to hix 4 and tsim 30 mesotrophic state with 4 hix 12 and tsim 50 eutrophic state with 12 hix 18 and tsim 70 hyper eutrophic status with hix 18 and tsim 70 4 discussion 4 1 water quality and social economic factors the higher determination coefficients positive linear relationships between tn and chla p 0 01 than between tp and chla p 0 05 suggested that nitrogen availability was probably the limiting factor of phytoplankton growth in the water reservoirs sampled for the present study tn level is a critical water chemical parameter and the strong relationships between tn and acdom254 suggested that tn plays an important role in determining cdom level in water reservoirs across china the significant correlations between acdom254 and tp chla indicated that the cdom sources are also related to phosphorus inputs and phytoplankton activities the correlations between cdom absorption and urban population size indicated that anthropogenic activities to some extent are important contributors to the cdom pool in the water reservoirs this interpretation would be in agreement with a previous study in lakes from the yungui region zhang et al 2010 the strong correlation between tn and qt further indicated that the fluorescent cdom was dominated by organic nitrogen containing compounds especially terrestrial humic like q5 and fulvic like q3 substances the linear correlation between humic like component of fdom q5 and tn can be attributed to the nitrogen composition of the humic compounds present in water bodies zhao et al 2017 the slope of the relationship between tn and q5 decreases from oligotrophic to eutrophic reservoirs slope for oligotrophic 0 07 mesotrophic 0 035 eutrophic 0 03 that pattern also indicated a connection between the relative abundance of large humic like molecules and organic nitrogen level in the water reservoirs investigated the correlations between chla and q4 q2 indicated that phytoplankton activities are related to autochthonous fluorescent components the significant correlation between tp and q5 q3 indicated that phosphorus is an important source for allochthonous fluorescent components previous studies had shown that the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in drainage waters during the rainy season can be much higher than in other months of the year zinabu 2002 chen et al 2010 with expected changes in the global climate heavy rainstorms high water temperature the impact of extreme weather events on water quality could exacerbate in some world regions michalak 2016 therefore in the future studies we will carry on more fieldtrips to discuss the seasonal impact on cdom and fdom in details the positive correlation between industrial wastewater discharge and q4 of microbial protein like components likely reflect stimulation of microbial activity from organic materials discharged from industrial and other anthropogenic sources microbial by products may have contributed to the protein like fluorescent compounds revealed by the fri eem analysis yang et al 2007 the large industrial facilities and wastewater outlets upstream of some of the reservoirs are potential contributors to increase in bacteria derived dom the positive correlation between domestic sewage discharge and tryptophan like components q2 observed in the present study is similar to the results of wang et al 2012 who interpreted the abundance of a tryptophan like component as an indicator of intensive anthropogenic activities and microbial degradation of exogenous waste other studies have reported strong tryptophan like fluorescence intensities in aquatic systems impacted by urban activities including discharge of residential sewage and animal farm wastes hong et al 2005 yang et al 2007 zhou et al 2018 in addition the relationships between urban population size and microbial protein like components indicated that human activities might have resulted in high load of household sewage that fueled phytoplankton growth and degradation of dead biomass by resident microbes stedmon and bro 2008 williams et al 2010 yamashita et al 2008 yao et al 2011 the strong correlation between cropland area and q3 q5 indicated that land disturbance during farming activities can be a significant driver of terrestrial cdom input into the water reservoirs supporting that mechanism is the significant correlation observed between gdp and the allochthonous fdom components q3 and q5 the correlations between agricultural input fertilizers pesticides and the abundance of microbial protein like compounds further underscore the influence of non point agricultural pollution on nutrients enrichment phytoplankton growth and intensification of the eutrophication phenomenon in the water reservoirs moreover previous studies have noted that pesticides can be photo chemically transformed in wetland waters zeng and arnold 2013 with cdom as intermediates reaction products young et al 2013 further investigations are needed to explore possible linkages between the photochemical transformation of pesticides and the optical properties of cdom in inland waters and especially water reservoirs in agricultural landscapes 4 2 the impact of altitude on reservoir cdom previous studies have reported that the inherent optical properties of cdom in natural waters can significantly affected by altitude and direct solar radiation morris 2009 morel and bélanger 2006 zhang et al 2010 reported that altitude negatively affected cdom absorption in lakes in the yungui plateau our results showed that with increased altitude both the cdom absorption at 254 nm and the allochthonous fdom components q3 and q5 significantly decreased p 0 01 table 3 sobek et al 2007 also found a significant negative correlation between altitude and doc concentration based on a large database of 7514 lakes from all over the world altitude could affect cdom properties through decreased human activity increased photochemical degradation and decreased terrestrial cdom input due to reduced terrestrial productivity and catchment area in high altitude regions zhang et al 2010 the high altitude reservoirs receive higher solar radiation than reservoirs located in lowland areas nima et al 2016 as reported for the large and shallow lake taihu prolonged water retention time and high uv light penetration could enhance the photo degradation of terrestrially derived humic rich cdom zhang et al 2013 shi et al 2014 in our study the decrease in cdom absorption fulvic like components and humic like components also indicated that high exposure of cdom to solar radiation in high altitude water reservoirs may have resulted in photo induced degradation of cdom although the r2 of the correlation between altitude and daylight time is low the high coefficient r2 for the correlation between altitude and solar radiation implied the process of photo degradation of cdom is more related to solar radiation intensity rather than the duration of daylight the positive correlations between altitude and s275 295 and the negative correlations between altitude and suva254 could further support the above interpretation a similar mechanism was invoked to explain cdom characteristics in high latitude alpine lakes receiving high solar uv fluxes causing alterations in dom composition and an abundance of compounds with low aromaticity sommaruga et al 1999 sommaruga 2001 similar observations were made in the us cascade mountains with an elevation range of 600 to 2000 m nelson 1991 the present study adds to our existing knowledge on that topic and the need to increase our understanding of the role of uv radiation on c chemistry in high altitude water bodies round the globe the fdom in reservoirs was predominantly associated with fulvic and humic acids which explained the low correlation between autochthonous fdom components q1 q2 and q4 and altitude another possible reason for the lower correlation between these variables could be the rapid photo degradation of algal derived cdom in deep waters from high altitude water reservoirs johannessen et al 2007 hulatt et al 2009 this interpretation would be consistent with prior studies that showed a stronger correlation between cdom absorption and the humic like peak than between cdom absorption and the protein like peak kowalczuk et al 2010 in terms of allochthonous fdom components the decreasing rate slope of humic like component q5 q 5 5ln altitude 50 p 0 01 was higher than that of fulvic like acids q3 q3 2ln altitude 20 p 0 01 this observation suggests that the loss of fluorescent humic like components is significantly higher than that of fulvic like components it is consistent with a previous study which considered that humic acid is the primary target of dom photo degradation in natural waters wu et al 2005 in surface waters photo degradation of the humic acid fraction is significantly greater than that of the fulvic acid fraction it follows that fulvic acid is photolytically more stable than humic like materials of cdom in aqueous systems with long water residence time wu et al 2005 it has been speculated that the high photolability of humic like components could be related to their sensitivity to ph or the high production rate of h2o2 upon irradiation mostofa et al 2009 additional research is clearly needed to elucidate the underlying drivers of cdom photo degradation in natural waters the effect of altitude on cdom properties and composition can be indirectly connected to trophic state due to the effects of altitude on nutrient input and on human activity norsang et al 2014 nima et al 2016 song et al 2019 in addition regions of high altitude are often characterized by limited vegetation growth low cropland acreage and low gdp the relationship between altitude and tsim fig 5a illustrated that trend and showed low primary productivity and low human disturbance in the watersheds draining into the high altitude reservoirs these observations are in agreement with the results of zhang et al 2010 the trend also suggested a possible co variation between trophic state and altitude with both factors affecting cdom concentration and composition the significant positive correlation between altitude and s275 295 p 0 01 table 3 indicated that the proportion of humic acids tends to decrease with high latitude due to decrease in terrestrial productivity resulting in low terrestrial cdom input the negative correlation between altitude and suva254 also implies that the aromaticity and molecular weight of cdom also decreased p 0 01 table 3 it indicated that altitude indeed affects the sources and composition of cdom to some extent 4 3 trophic gradients versus cdom absorption and fluorescence past studies relating bio optical parameters such as chla specific absorption coefficient and trophic status have been reported in oceanic waters oubelkheir et al 2005 brotas et al 2013 for inland waters however few studies have focused on the relationship between cdom absorption coefficient and composition and tsi zhang et al 2010 using a comprehensive dataset from several lakes in china zhang et al 2018 noted a parallel increase between cdom absorption and trophic state however that dataset only included lakes in the eastern lake region and the yungui lake region of china very few studies have examined the relationships between cdom and tsim for the whole country and to our knowledge no prior attempt has been made for the country s water reservoirs our study is perhaps the first that has attempted that examination indeed as has been reported for lakes our results have shown strong relationships between the modified trophic states index tsim and ln transformed acdom 254 suggesting that the trophic state of water reservoirs can be predicted from cdom absorption we further demonstrated that the trophic state of reservoirs can also be derived from the humification index hix of fdom fig 6a d our results further indicated that cdom composition was significantly different between reservoirs of different trophic states specifically cdom in the high trophic state reservoirs tends to be dominated by high molecular weight compounds than cdom from oligotrophic reservoirs fig 2b few past studies have investigated cdom absorption coefficients and composition as a function of the trophic state of surface water zhang et al 2010 mladenov et al 2011 liu et al 2014 brandão et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 for example the hyper eutrophic pampulha reservoir s275 295 20 µm 1 had a lower spectral slope than the oligotrophic lake dom helvecio s275 295 30 µm 1 conversely and similar to our results fig 2a the cdom absorption coefficients of oligotrophic lakes were markedly lower than those of lakes and reservoirs with higher trophic status zhang et al 2010 mladenov et al 2011 liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the large range of trophic states exhibited by the water reservoirs included in the present study provided a unique opportunity to examine general trends in cdom absorption variability in relation to the trophic gradient of aquatic ecosystems however it is important to recognize the limitations of the data presented due to logistical and financial constraints factors such as land use hydrology seasonal variability were not systematically investigated wilson and xenopoulos 2009 yet in the context of a changing global climate it is important for future studies to examine the significance of these hydro climatic factors on the source and composition of cdom in aquatic ecosystems the significant increase of humic like components q5 and fulvic like component q3 with increased trophic state tsim suggested that trophic state is affected by allochthonous fluorescence substances likely originated from the surrounding catchments and increase in terrestrial fluorescent components the autochthonous components q2 and q4 were also significantly correlated p 0 01 table 3 with trophic states probably due to increased phytoplankton biomass in nutrient rich and high trophic state reservoirs previous studies have reported similar increase of humic like fluorescent substances with higher trophic state miller et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 the percentage distribution of individual fluorescent components and the increased proportion of allochthonous fluorescent components q3 and q5 indicated that cdom fluorescence in the water reservoirs was dominated by humic like components and that with increased trophic state allochthonous input from surrounding catchments formed a larger contribution to total fluorescence this result is different from several previous studies that have proposed that autochthonous protein like components were predominant in lakes of the yungui plateau and other alpine and subalpine lakes hood et al 2003 miller et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 these differences may due to the complex interactions of geological settings land cover or land use climatic conditions and intensity of anthropogenic disturbances in the area surrounding the reservoirs all these factors can have variable impact on input and chemistry of allochthonous cdom delivered to man made water reservoirs 4 4 implications and uncertainty for tsim models based on hix the tsim provides an overall assessment of the ecological health of water reservoirs and can be used as a guide to make decisions regarding the monitoring and management of water quality in these important water bodies considering the relationships between cdom and trophic state some researchers have proposed to define lake trophic status using the nutrient color paradigm to represent cdom absorption williamson et al 1999 webster et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 proposed to use cdom absorption to classify the trophic status of lakes cunha et al 2013 proposed a new tsi using tp and chla concentrations webster et al 2008 integrated tp concentration and colored doc values to define trophic state using a diverse dataset of 1646 lakes the significant correlation between hix and tsim indicated that the allochthonous fluorescence sources increased with trophic state and that intense eutrophication should be expected with increase in the humification of cdom sources fig 6d a rise in terrestrial dom input would also imply greater nutrients input from the catchment which in turn trigger phytoplankton growth and increased risk of hypoxia many studies have shown that the trophic status is strongly dependent upon the input of nutrients organic matter energy from terrestrial ecosystems kissman et al 2017 beck et al 2018 here based on strong relationships between hix and chemistry of dissolved organic matter in freshwater reservoirs we demonstrated for the first time a new approach to determine the trophic state of reservoirs using cdom fluorescence characteristics the traditional tsi calculation using chla sdd and tp does not fully account for the interactions among these parameters and for the influence of water color especially for turbid inland waters zhu et al 2011 kutser 2012 the fluorescence cdom is easy to determine and is more sensitive than traditional water quality measurements the distribution of cdom fluorescence in water reservoirs can be made with handheld spectrometers as well as with sensors on board of unmanned aerial vehicles and land observing satellites making it possible to continuously monitor changes in the trophic state of water reservoirs many of which are sources of drinking water our results are based on a large dataset encompassing reservoirs of a large range of trophic state therefore our assessment model should be applicable to a wide range of inland water bodies within the study region however some errors or uncertainties are likely if the proposed classification is applied to oligotrophic and hyper eutrophic reservoirs since few samples from oligotrophic and hyper eutrophic systems were included in model development system error during cdom fluorescence measurement may also affect the accuracy of hix to some extent the model did not account for difference in geological settings and seasonal variation in the chemistry of allocthonous cdom input from terrestrial sources future studies should consider these limitations and should endeavor to collect data from other eco regions in order to build a more robust model for accurate determination of the trophic status of water reservoirs from the optical properties of cdom 5 conclusions the present study examined the optical characteristics of cdom from 131 water reservoirs of different trophic state distributed across china based on strong relationships between the hix of fdom and the tsim of water reservoirs the study demonstrated that the hix of cdom fluorescence can be used as a new classification index to express the trophic state of water reservoirs this method highlights the linkage of trophic status and dom optical characteristics and provides an approach for rapid and continuous monitoring of the ecological integrity of water reservoirs future studies should examine the applicability and performance of that approach in other types of inland waters around the globe

6272,chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom represents the optically active component of the dom pool and originates from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources the fluorescent characteristics of dissolved organic matter fdom has been widely used to trace cdom sources and infer its composition however little is known about the optical and fluorescent properties of cdom in drinking water reservoirs and the variability of cdom properties along trophic gradients in these aquatic systems a total of 536 water samples were collected between 2015 and 2017 from 131 reservoirs across china to characterize cdom and fdom properties using both light absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies and examine relationships with water quality condition as expressed by the modified trophic state index tsim of the reservoirs range 12 tsim 78 with increased reservoir trophic status cdom absorption coefficients at 254 nm a cdom 254 and total fluorescence of fri eems excitation emission matrix coupled with fluorescence regional integration increased significantly p 0 01 our results indicated that the nutrients in aquatic systems and the social economy factors including wastewater sewage cultivated land gdp population and altitude affect the cdom absorption and fluorescence significantly p 0 05 most importantly we proposed a new classification standard associated with eutrophic status via cdom humification index hix due to the significant correlation between each other p 0 01 hix less than 4 was corresponding to tsim less than 30 as oligotrophic states 4 hix 12 was corresponding to tsim less than 50 as mesotrophic states 12 hix 18 was corresponding to tsim less than 70 as eutrophic states hix more than 18 is defined as hypereutrophic status with tsim 70 this method highlights the importance of cdom fluorescence for aquatic dom input and strengthens the linkage between the trophic status index and cdom characteristics it also contributes to establish a new rapid assessing model with quick experimental measurements to monitor the trophic status of water reservoirs keywords cdom fri eem inland waters eutrophication 1 introduction china is the greatest dam building country in the world and has more than 87 000 reservoirs with a total water storage capacity of 706 billion m3 yang et al 2012 reservoirs are important for both economic and social sustainable development providing a stable supply of water for agricultural industrial recreational and residential use han 2010 nationwide reservoirs account for a significant amount of the total urban drinking water sources vörösmarty et al 2000 in many parts of the country however that water supply is threatened by eutrophication a condition affecting many reservoirs due to high input of nitrogen n and phosphorus p from domestic sources and extensive agricultural and industrial activities smith and schindler 2009 this nutrient enrichment has implications for the trophic state classification of the water reservoir the trophic state is defined as the total weight of living biomass in a water body at a specific location and time dunalska 2011 the most frequently used parameters for determination of the trophic state of a water body include concentration of nutrients total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn and chlorophyll a chla as well as water clarity expressed as secchi disk depth sdd carpenter et al 1998 nürnberg 2001 carlson 1977 and more recently kratzer and brezonik 2010 proposed a common classification using a points system ranging from 0 to 100 tsi trophic state index laboratory measurements of these parameters can be quite laborious which precludes quick assessment of the trophic state of reservoirs as a result trophic state information is generally available at low temporal and spatial resolutions zhang et al 2018 in addition to nutrients availability and primary productivity in aquatic systems the trophic state can be affected by environmental pollution from anthropogenic activity by lighting and turbidity conditions and by the quantity and quality of organic matter present in the water body dunalska 2009 collection of all these data can be costly and time consuming therefore there is an urgent need to develop an alternative method to assess the trophic state of water reservoirs using parameters that can be retrieved from optical characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom plays an important role in the ecology of aquatic systems a high concentration of organic matter in natural waters is generally an indicator of pollution and potential for hypoxia zhao et al 2016 therefore knowledge of the sources composition and transformation of cdom would further our ability to monitor and protect the ecological integrity of aquatic systems the fluorescent cdom fdom has been widely used to trace cdom sources distribution and composition zhang et al 2009 2010 in that regard eem excitation emission matrix coupled with fluorescence regional integration fri eem has been a promising quantitative technique that is based on wavelength dependent paired fluorescence intensity data to define eem regions and each integrated fluorescence intensity region represents a specific fdom component chen et al 2003 zhao et al 2017 the development of more sensors related to cdom fluorescence can facilitate the adoption of fri eem techniques for monitoring of freshwater ecosystems liu et al 2014 lee et al 2015 bowling et al 2016 therefore models can be developed to assess the trophic state of freshwater systems using cdom fluorescence this would lead to comprehensive and regular monitoring of water quality in terms of both light condition and nutrients and ultimately more effective reservoirs management according to a national monitoring of reservoirs conducted in 2015 9 8 67 2 19 7 and 3 3 of the reservoirs in china were found to be oligotrophic mesotrophic light eutrophic and mid eutrophic respectively some studies have proposed to assess trophic state using the nutrient color paradigm an approach largely based on cdom absorption and total organic matter webster et al 2008 dunalska 2011 however even though fdom is a significant part of cdom no linkage between fdom properties and the trophic state has been established for reservoirs in previous studies therefore the main objectives of this study were to 1 assess cdom absorption and fluorescence properties and composition changes along trophic gradients from oligotrophic to eutrophic in freshwater reservoirs 2 develop relationships between cdom properties and trophic state index tsim of the reservoirs 3 examine relationships between cdom fluorescence and altitude water chemical parameters and socio economic factors and 4 discuss potential applications of the fri eem model for assessing and monitoring the trophic state of reservoirs using cdom fluorescence data 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling a total of 131 reservoirs were selected across china to characterize fdom features fig 1 in total 536 water samples were collected mainly between 2015 and 2017 in the northeast part of china 192 samples were taken from late august 2015 and august 2016 field campaign was carried out in the eastern part of china and yungui region of china in october 2015 and 262 samples were collected from 56 reservoirs for the inner mongolia region 55 samples were taken in early august of 2015 there were 27 samples taken from the tibetan plateau region during the late of july in 2015 and 2017 during water sampling geographical coordinates and altitude of each sampling point were recorded with a gps receiver several water quality parameters were measured in situ including ph salinity water temperature electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids tds using ysi 600 xlm sondes ysi inc yellow springs oh secchi disk depth sdd was measured with a secchi disk all water samples were stored in 1 l acid cleaned plastic bottles held on ice packs and transported to the laboratory as soon as possible in the laboratory water samples were stored at 4 c in a refrigerator and analyzed within 2 days 2 2 water quality measurements water samples were analyzed for doc concentration on a shimadzu toc analyzer 680 c in the laboratory total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were determined spectrophotometrically after digestion of the samples with alkaline potassium persulfate clesceri et al 1998 chlorophyll a chla concentration was obtained through extraction of a filtered sample 0 45 µm whatman gf f with acetone solution 90 and measured with a shimazdu uv 2600 pc spectrophotometer jeffrey humphrey 1975 total suspended matter tsm was measured gravimetrically as described in zhao et al 2016 2 3 cdom absorption measurements and indices in the laboratory water samples were filtered through a 0 7 µm pre combusted whatman gf f filter and then through a 0 22 µm millipore membrane cellulose filter cdom absorption spectra were determined using a shimadzu uv 2600pc uv vis spectrophotometer fitted with a 1 cm quartz cuvette in the spectral region from 200 to 800 nm 1 nm interval cdom spectra for milli q water were used as a reference the cdom absorption coefficient a λ was computed according to eq 1 1 a λ 2 303 a λ l where l is the cuvette length m and a λ

bricaud et al 1995 babin et al 2003 in this study the absorption coefficient a cdom 254 was used as a proxy for cdom relative concentration s is calculated by fitting a linear model to the data over a wavelength range of 275 to 295 nm with eq 2 the slope at the range of 275 295 nm s275 295 was used to characterize the cdom composition and infer its sources helms et al 2008 specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 defined as the absorbance at 254 nm divided by the doc concentration mg l was used as an index of dom aromaticity with high values of suva254 indicating dom with a high aromatic content and low values indicating dom with a low aromatic content weishaar et al 2003 the ratio m of cdom absorption coefficient at 250 nm and absorption coefficient at 365 nm m acdom250 acdom365 reflects the relative molecular weight of the humic component of dom with decreased m indicating increased molecular size of cdom jones et al 1988 2 4 cdom fluorescence measurement and fri analysis cdom fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were measured using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a 700 v xenon lamp the excitation ex and emission em scanning ranges were

eliminate the water raman scatter the elimination of the inner filter effect was performed by adjusting for cdom absorbance at the corresponding wavelengths according to eq 2 mcknight et al 2001 kothawala et al 2014 interpolation was used to remove the effect of rayleigh scattering stedmon and bro 2008 3 q cor q obs 10 a ex a em 2 where qobs and qcor represent fluorescence intensity of eems

wavelength independent fluorescence intensity data based on eem spectra chen et al 2003 sun and mopper 2016 eem maps were divided into five regions q1 ex 200 250 nm em 250 330 nm tyrosine like protein

536 based on tsim values from low to high according to the ranking order of the sampling one sample was extracted at each of the two samples interval the extracted 1 3 samples were used for model validation while the others for model calibration the correlation analysis between tsim and hix was implemented the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and percentage root mean square error rmse between the measured and predicted values were calculated to assess goodness of fit and validation accuracy the rmse and rmse were determined using eqs 10 and 11 n is the number of

significant when p 0 05 mapping of sampling sites was conducted using arcgis 10 1 environmental systems research institute redlands ca 3 results 3 1 biogeochemical characteristics and trophic state the sampled reservoirs had a wide range of trophic status as illustrated by the variations in nutrients and chla table 1 the average concentration of doc sdd chla and tn tp in the eutrophic reservoirs was noticeably higher than in the oligotrophic and mesotrophic reservoirs table 1 the difference in doc concentration and other water chemical parameters among reservoirs of different trophic status was statistically significant p 0 001 among the three trophic states of reservoirs mean doc concentration ranged from 1 56 to 7 17 mg l 1 similarly the mean tp and tn concentration exhibited significant trophic variability ranging from 0 03 to 0 15 mg p l 1 and 0 91 to 2 98 mg n l 1 respectively table 1 the range for chla concentration was 1 02 to 46 62 µg l 1 for all reservoirs the differences of tn tp chla and sdd among the three trophic gradients of reservoirs were all significant p 0 01 the trophic states index tsim covered a wide range from 12 to 78 in total our dataset included reservoirs with a wide range of trophic states again suggesting that the data collected encompass conditions likely to be found in water reservoirs across china 3 2 cdom absorption and fdom characteristics 3 2 1 cdom characteristics the a cdom 254 ranged from 2 21 m 1 to 91 29 m 1 among the sampled reservoirs and the mean a cdom 254 showed an increasing trend from oligotrophic mesotrophic to eutrophic reservoirs respectively fig 2 table s1 the a cdom 254 values were significantly different among reservoirs of different trophic status p 0 01 the mean s275 295 for oligotrophic mesotrophic and eutrophic reservoirs was 27 2 µm 20 6 um and 20 1 µm respectively fig 2 the suva254 ranged from 2 98 to 4 60 l mg m fig 2 the mean value of m related to the molecular weight of humic materials decreased from 16 13 to 6 92 with increasing trophic state p 0 01 from oligotrophic to mesotrophic s275 295 increased significantly p 0 01 while from mesotrophic to eutrophic status s275 295 was nearly invariant a similar but inverse trend was found with regard to suva254 table s1 the significant changes from oligotrophic to mesotrophic and slight changes of s275 295 m and suva254 from mesotrophic to eutrophic indicated that in the oligotrophic reservoirs cdom was predominantly derived from autochthonous sources while the mesotrophic and eutrophic reservoirs have relatively high proportions of cdom derived from allochthonous sources and exhibiting large molecular weight 3 2 2 fri fdom components in this study the fri based eems in different trophic reservoirs of china were analyzed to document trends in cdom fluorescence characteristics about trophic status the excitation emission area volumes q i and pi i 1 2 3 4 and 5 were proportional to the total fluorescence intensity and the relative contribution of the five different components to the total fluorescence intensity the examples of eem fluorescence spectra from yamdrok lake oligotrophic xiaolangdi reservoir mesotrophic hamatong reservoir eutrophic and xiashan reservoir hyper eutrophic were selected as representative of reservoirs in various trophic gradients and the partition of the five fluorescence components based on fri eem are shown in fig 3 the total fluorescence intensity qt ranged from 5 48 1010 nm to 4 51 1012 nm for all water samples and the mean qt from oligotrophic mesotrophic to eutrophic status was 1 32 1011 nm 2 64 1011 nm and 6 04 1011 respectively fig 4 a the relative contribution of individual components to total fluorescence intensity differed among water reservoirs of different trophic status fig 4b it was found that the q5 humic like and q3 fulvic like compounds were predominant in fdom for all types of reservoirs with increased trophic status the percentage of q1 and q4 decreased while the percentage of q3 and q5 increased significantly p 0 01 the mean humification index hix from oligotrophic mesotrophic to eutrophic reservoirs was in the order of 3 26 8 08 and 8 76 fig 4c 3 3 cdom optical properties versus social and biogeochemical factors the cdom absorption coefficient at 254 nm showed a strong correlation with tn r 0 93 p 0 05 table 2 while there were weak correlations between cdom absorption and chla or tp p 0 05 tn tp cultivated land area and gdp all showed positive correlations with allochthonous cdom fluorescent components q3 and q5 p 0 05 t test table 2 however chla sewage discharge agricultural fertilizer and pesticide use and urban population size had close relationships with autochthonous cdom fluorescent components q2 and q4 p 0 05 t test table 2 the relationships between dem and cdom absorption and fdom were all significant p 0 01 fig 5 according to data obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn solar radiation increased significantly with altitude r2 0 41 p 0 01 fig 5b although sunlight duration also arises with altitude the relationship was weak r2 0 18 p 0 01 fig 5c nevertheless s275 295 increased significantly p 0 01 with elevation suggesting photo degradation could be an important process in the high altitude reservoirs fig 5d 3 4 cdom optical properties versus trophic states there were weak relationships between individual tsi parameters tsi chla tsitp tsisdd and cdom absorption p 0 05 but the synthetic tsim showed a significant relationship with cdom absorption r2 0 60 p 0 01 which suggested that cdom absorption coefficients at 254 nm could be considered a potential indicator to evaluate the trophic status of reservoirs the exponential regression equations between tsim and allochthonous cdom fluorescent components q3 and q5 were obtained with a relative moderate coefficient q3 r2 0 48 p 0 01 q5 r2 0 45 p 0 01 fig 6 b c the tsim was negatively affected by cdom absorption slope r 0 21 p 0 01 in contrast suva254 increased as the tsim increased r 0 19 p 0 01 table 3 an important result of the present study is the significant correlations between tsim and hix coefficient of determination of 0 67 across chinese reservoirs this calibration model was applied to the remaining water samples for validation the validation result is presented in fig 7 the rmse was 9 86 and the rmse value of 4 73 and d is 0 92 given these relationships fig 6d and fig 7 we proposed a new classification whereby cdom humification index can be used as a proxy for tsim table 4 the proposed classification would be as follows oligotrophic state corresponding to hix 4 and tsim 30 mesotrophic state with 4 hix 12 and tsim 50 eutrophic state with 12 hix 18 and tsim 70 hyper eutrophic status with hix 18 and tsim 70 4 discussion 4 1 water quality and social economic factors the higher determination coefficients positive linear relationships between tn and chla p 0 01 than between tp and chla p 0 05 suggested that nitrogen availability was probably the limiting factor of phytoplankton growth in the water reservoirs sampled for the present study tn level is a critical water chemical parameter and the strong relationships between tn and acdom254 suggested that tn plays an important role in determining cdom level in water reservoirs across china the significant correlations between acdom254 and tp chla indicated that the cdom sources are also related to phosphorus inputs and phytoplankton activities the correlations between cdom absorption and urban population size indicated that anthropogenic activities to some extent are important contributors to the cdom pool in the water reservoirs this interpretation would be in agreement with a previous study in lakes from the yungui region zhang et al 2010 the strong correlation between tn and qt further indicated that the fluorescent cdom was dominated by organic nitrogen containing compounds especially terrestrial humic like q5 and fulvic like q3 substances the linear correlation between humic like component of fdom q5 and tn can be attributed to the nitrogen composition of the humic compounds present in water bodies zhao et al 2017 the slope of the relationship between tn and q5 decreases from oligotrophic to eutrophic reservoirs slope for oligotrophic 0 07 mesotrophic 0 035 eutrophic 0 03 that pattern also indicated a connection between the relative abundance of large humic like molecules and organic nitrogen level in the water reservoirs investigated the correlations between chla and q4 q2 indicated that phytoplankton activities are related to autochthonous fluorescent components the significant correlation between tp and q5 q3 indicated that phosphorus is an important source for allochthonous fluorescent components previous studies had shown that the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in drainage waters during the rainy season can be much higher than in other months of the year zinabu 2002 chen et al 2010 with expected changes in the global climate heavy rainstorms high water temperature the impact of extreme weather events on water quality could exacerbate in some world regions michalak 2016 therefore in the future studies we will carry on more fieldtrips to discuss the seasonal impact on cdom and fdom in details the positive correlation between industrial wastewater discharge and q4 of microbial protein like components likely reflect stimulation of microbial activity from organic materials discharged from industrial and other anthropogenic sources microbial by products may have contributed to the protein like fluorescent compounds revealed by the fri eem analysis yang et al 2007 the large industrial facilities and wastewater outlets upstream of some of the reservoirs are potential contributors to increase in bacteria derived dom the positive correlation between domestic sewage discharge and tryptophan like components q2 observed in the present study is similar to the results of wang et al 2012 who interpreted the abundance of a tryptophan like component as an indicator of intensive anthropogenic activities and microbial degradation of exogenous waste other studies have reported strong tryptophan like fluorescence intensities in aquatic systems impacted by urban activities including discharge of residential sewage and animal farm wastes hong et al 2005 yang et al 2007 zhou et al 2018 in addition the relationships between urban population size and microbial protein like components indicated that human activities might have resulted in high load of household sewage that fueled phytoplankton growth and degradation of dead biomass by resident microbes stedmon and bro 2008 williams et al 2010 yamashita et al 2008 yao et al 2011 the strong correlation between cropland area and q3 q5 indicated that land disturbance during farming activities can be a significant driver of terrestrial cdom input into the water reservoirs supporting that mechanism is the significant correlation observed between gdp and the allochthonous fdom components q3 and q5 the correlations between agricultural input fertilizers pesticides and the abundance of microbial protein like compounds further underscore the influence of non point agricultural pollution on nutrients enrichment phytoplankton growth and intensification of the eutrophication phenomenon in the water reservoirs moreover previous studies have noted that pesticides can be photo chemically transformed in wetland waters zeng and arnold 2013 with cdom as intermediates reaction products young et al 2013 further investigations are needed to explore possible linkages between the photochemical transformation of pesticides and the optical properties of cdom in inland waters and especially water reservoirs in agricultural landscapes 4 2 the impact of altitude on reservoir cdom previous studies have reported that the inherent optical properties of cdom in natural waters can significantly affected by altitude and direct solar radiation morris 2009 morel and bélanger 2006 zhang et al 2010 reported that altitude negatively affected cdom absorption in lakes in the yungui plateau our results showed that with increased altitude both the cdom absorption at 254 nm and the allochthonous fdom components q3 and q5 significantly decreased p 0 01 table 3 sobek et al 2007 also found a significant negative correlation between altitude and doc concentration based on a large database of 7514 lakes from all over the world altitude could affect cdom properties through decreased human activity increased photochemical degradation and decreased terrestrial cdom input due to reduced terrestrial productivity and catchment area in high altitude regions zhang et al 2010 the high altitude reservoirs receive higher solar radiation than reservoirs located in lowland areas nima et al 2016 as reported for the large and shallow lake taihu prolonged water retention time and high uv light penetration could enhance the photo degradation of terrestrially derived humic rich cdom zhang et al 2013 shi et al 2014 in our study the decrease in cdom absorption fulvic like components and humic like components also indicated that high exposure of cdom to solar radiation in high altitude water reservoirs may have resulted in photo induced degradation of cdom although the r2 of the correlation between altitude and daylight time is low the high coefficient r2 for the correlation between altitude and solar radiation implied the process of photo degradation of cdom is more related to solar radiation intensity rather than the duration of daylight the positive correlations between altitude and s275 295 and the negative correlations between altitude and suva254 could further support the above interpretation a similar mechanism was invoked to explain cdom characteristics in high latitude alpine lakes receiving high solar uv fluxes causing alterations in dom composition and an abundance of compounds with low aromaticity sommaruga et al 1999 sommaruga 2001 similar observations were made in the us cascade mountains with an elevation range of 600 to 2000 m nelson 1991 the present study adds to our existing knowledge on that topic and the need to increase our understanding of the role of uv radiation on c chemistry in high altitude water bodies round the globe the fdom in reservoirs was predominantly associated with fulvic and humic acids which explained the low correlation between autochthonous fdom components q1 q2 and q4 and altitude another possible reason for the lower correlation between these variables could be the rapid photo degradation of algal derived cdom in deep waters from high altitude water reservoirs johannessen et al 2007 hulatt et al 2009 this interpretation would be consistent with prior studies that showed a stronger correlation between cdom absorption and the humic like peak than between cdom absorption and the protein like peak kowalczuk et al 2010 in terms of allochthonous fdom components the decreasing rate slope of humic like component q5 q 5 5ln altitude 50 p 0 01 was higher than that of fulvic like acids q3 q3 2ln altitude 20 p 0 01 this observation suggests that the loss of fluorescent humic like components is significantly higher than that of fulvic like components it is consistent with a previous study which considered that humic acid is the primary target of dom photo degradation in natural waters wu et al 2005 in surface waters photo degradation of the humic acid fraction is significantly greater than that of the fulvic acid fraction it follows that fulvic acid is photolytically more stable than humic like materials of cdom in aqueous systems with long water residence time wu et al 2005 it has been speculated that the high photolability of humic like components could be related to their sensitivity to ph or the high production rate of h2o2 upon irradiation mostofa et al 2009 additional research is clearly needed to elucidate the underlying drivers of cdom photo degradation in natural waters the effect of altitude on cdom properties and composition can be indirectly connected to trophic state due to the effects of altitude on nutrient input and on human activity norsang et al 2014 nima et al 2016 song et al 2019 in addition regions of high altitude are often characterized by limited vegetation growth low cropland acreage and low gdp the relationship between altitude and tsim fig 5a illustrated that trend and showed low primary productivity and low human disturbance in the watersheds draining into the high altitude reservoirs these observations are in agreement with the results of zhang et al 2010 the trend also suggested a possible co variation between trophic state and altitude with both factors affecting cdom concentration and composition the significant positive correlation between altitude and s275 295 p 0 01 table 3 indicated that the proportion of humic acids tends to decrease with high latitude due to decrease in terrestrial productivity resulting in low terrestrial cdom input the negative correlation between altitude and suva254 also implies that the aromaticity and molecular weight of cdom also decreased p 0 01 table 3 it indicated that altitude indeed affects the sources and composition of cdom to some extent 4 3 trophic gradients versus cdom absorption and fluorescence past studies relating bio optical parameters such as chla specific absorption coefficient and trophic status have been reported in oceanic waters oubelkheir et al 2005 brotas et al 2013 for inland waters however few studies have focused on the relationship between cdom absorption coefficient and composition and tsi zhang et al 2010 using a comprehensive dataset from several lakes in china zhang et al 2018 noted a parallel increase between cdom absorption and trophic state however that dataset only included lakes in the eastern lake region and the yungui lake region of china very few studies have examined the relationships between cdom and tsim for the whole country and to our knowledge no prior attempt has been made for the country s water reservoirs our study is perhaps the first that has attempted that examination indeed as has been reported for lakes our results have shown strong relationships between the modified trophic states index tsim and ln transformed acdom 254 suggesting that the trophic state of water reservoirs can be predicted from cdom absorption we further demonstrated that the trophic state of reservoirs can also be derived from the humification index hix of fdom fig 6a d our results further indicated that cdom composition was significantly different between reservoirs of different trophic states specifically cdom in the high trophic state reservoirs tends to be dominated by high molecular weight compounds than cdom from oligotrophic reservoirs fig 2b few past studies have investigated cdom absorption coefficients and composition as a function of the trophic state of surface water zhang et al 2010 mladenov et al 2011 liu et al 2014 brandão et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 for example the hyper eutrophic pampulha reservoir s275 295 20 µm 1 had a lower spectral slope than the oligotrophic lake dom helvecio s275 295 30 µm 1 conversely and similar to our results fig 2a the cdom absorption coefficients of oligotrophic lakes were markedly lower than those of lakes and reservoirs with higher trophic status zhang et al 2010 mladenov et al 2011 liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the large range of trophic states exhibited by the water reservoirs included in the present study provided a unique opportunity to examine general trends in cdom absorption variability in relation to the trophic gradient of aquatic ecosystems however it is important to recognize the limitations of the data presented due to logistical and financial constraints factors such as land use hydrology seasonal variability were not systematically investigated wilson and xenopoulos 2009 yet in the context of a changing global climate it is important for future studies to examine the significance of these hydro climatic factors on the source and composition of cdom in aquatic ecosystems the significant increase of humic like components q5 and fulvic like component q3 with increased trophic state tsim suggested that trophic state is affected by allochthonous fluorescence substances likely originated from the surrounding catchments and increase in terrestrial fluorescent components the autochthonous components q2 and q4 were also significantly correlated p 0 01 table 3 with trophic states probably due to increased phytoplankton biomass in nutrient rich and high trophic state reservoirs previous studies have reported similar increase of humic like fluorescent substances with higher trophic state miller et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 the percentage distribution of individual fluorescent components and the increased proportion of allochthonous fluorescent components q3 and q5 indicated that cdom fluorescence in the water reservoirs was dominated by humic like components and that with increased trophic state allochthonous input from surrounding catchments formed a larger contribution to total fluorescence this result is different from several previous studies that have proposed that autochthonous protein like components were predominant in lakes of the yungui plateau and other alpine and subalpine lakes hood et al 2003 miller et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 these differences may due to the complex interactions of geological settings land cover or land use climatic conditions and intensity of anthropogenic disturbances in the area surrounding the reservoirs all these factors can have variable impact on input and chemistry of allochthonous cdom delivered to man made water reservoirs 4 4 implications and uncertainty for tsim models based on hix the tsim provides an overall assessment of the ecological health of water reservoirs and can be used as a guide to make decisions regarding the monitoring and management of water quality in these important water bodies considering the relationships between cdom and trophic state some researchers have proposed to define lake trophic status using the nutrient color paradigm to represent cdom absorption williamson et al 1999 webster et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 proposed to use cdom absorption to classify the trophic status of lakes cunha et al 2013 proposed a new tsi using tp and chla concentrations webster et al 2008 integrated tp concentration and colored doc values to define trophic state using a diverse dataset of 1646 lakes the significant correlation between hix and tsim indicated that the allochthonous fluorescence sources increased with trophic state and that intense eutrophication should be expected with increase in the humification of cdom sources fig 6d a rise in terrestrial dom input would also imply greater nutrients input from the catchment which in turn trigger phytoplankton growth and increased risk of hypoxia many studies have shown that the trophic status is strongly dependent upon the input of nutrients organic matter energy from terrestrial ecosystems kissman et al 2017 beck et al 2018 here based on strong relationships between hix and chemistry of dissolved organic matter in freshwater reservoirs we demonstrated for the first time a new approach to determine the trophic state of reservoirs using cdom fluorescence characteristics the traditional tsi calculation using chla sdd and tp does not fully account for the interactions among these parameters and for the influence of water color especially for turbid inland waters zhu et al 2011 kutser 2012 the fluorescence cdom is easy to determine and is more sensitive than traditional water quality measurements the distribution of cdom fluorescence in water reservoirs can be made with handheld spectrometers as well as with sensors on board of unmanned aerial vehicles and land observing satellites making it possible to continuously monitor changes in the trophic state of water reservoirs many of which are sources of drinking water our results are based on a large dataset encompassing reservoirs of a large range of trophic state therefore our assessment model should be applicable to a wide range of inland water bodies within the study region however some errors or uncertainties are likely if the proposed classification is applied to oligotrophic and hyper eutrophic reservoirs since few samples from oligotrophic and hyper eutrophic systems were included in model development system error during cdom fluorescence measurement may also affect the accuracy of hix to some extent the model did not account for difference in geological settings and seasonal variation in the chemistry of allocthonous cdom input from terrestrial sources future studies should consider these limitations and should endeavor to collect data from other eco regions in order to build a more robust model for accurate determination of the trophic status of water reservoirs from the optical properties of cdom 5 conclusions the present study examined the optical characteristics of cdom from 131 water reservoirs of different trophic state distributed across china based on strong relationships between the hix of fdom and the tsim of water reservoirs the study demonstrated that the hix of cdom fluorescence can be used as a new classification index to express the trophic state of water reservoirs this method highlights the linkage of trophic status and dom optical characteristics and provides an approach for rapid and continuous monitoring of the ecological integrity of water reservoirs future studies should examine the applicability and performance of that approach in other types of inland waters around the globe

this manuscript was handled by a bardossy editor in chief with the assistance of purna chandra nayak associate editor joint multifractal spectrum analysis jms is an effective approach for investigation of relationship among hydrological variables and is regarded as one potential way to reveal nonlinear relationship in hydrology in this study the joint multifractal spectrum analysis was for the first time used to analyze soil moisture soil temperature precipitation sm st p relationship pearson s linear correlation coefficient considering lag effects and scale effects was also applied for the aims of comparison soil data were collected at four sites in tibet and three depths for each site 10 cm 30 cm and 60 cm at 2 hourly frequency from november 2016 to november 2017 correlation analysis showed that the coefficients varied at every measurement point but failed to provide general and comprehensive analysis of sm st p relationship on the contrary multifractal spectra of sm st p confirmed that the relationship was strong for all measurement points furthermore jms analysis provided holistic results including verification of multifractal of sm st p relationship relationship evaluation for each part of variables separately high value middle value low value intuitive diagrammatic comparison of sm st and sm p relationships etc seasonal jms analysis was adopted to investigate the freezing thawing process in the study area as well the multifractal spectra of frozen soil site and no frozen soil site are totally different for dry cold period but similar for rainy warm period the difference in multifractal of sm st p relationship with and without frozen soil presented the latent application of jms to quantitatively detect the process of frozen soil this study implied the capability of jms analysis in hydrology especially for multivariable relationship like sm st p relationship keywords joint multifractal analysis nonlinear relationship soil moisture frozen soil 1 introduction nonlinearity commonly exists in hydrology schertzer et al 2010 however when there is a motivation to investigate the relationship among hydrological variables multiple linear correlation analysis or multiple linear regression is the first and in lots of cases the only method used ma et al 2018 segondet al 2006 yang et al 2014a b zhang et al 2018 in many studies although the relations among hydrological variables are regarded as nonlinear the spearman s rank correlation is the only analysis tool applied crowet al 2018 hu et al 2014 spearman s rank correlation coefficient is rank based nonparametric size independent and has been commonly used over decades nevertheless as a result of replacing values with ranks rank correlation coefficient describes only the relationship between ranks of variables and misses out details that has become one of the drawbacks of hydrological studies schertzer et al 2010 one possible approach to more efficient relationship analysis of hydrological variables is joint multifractal analysis method fractal analysis was firstly raised by the hydrologist hurst in 1951 and in the beginning the fractal analysis only included monofractal analysis multifractal analysis method was firstly introduced by evertsz and mandelbrot 1992 based on monofractal analysis multifractal analysis is more precise with more detailed results than monofractal analysis multifractal analysis could provide photographic descriptions of fractal characteristics which is dominated by measures and length of measurement boxes by giving fractal characteristics like singularity exponents fractal dimension and so on garcía marín et al 2013 de lima and grasman 1999 medina cobo et al 2017 there are three main advantages of joint multifractal spectrum analysis 1 it could evaluate the correlation of each part of variables separately high value middle value low value 2 it could overcome the obstacles of scale difference and 3 it can characterize the nonlinear relationship among hydrological variables the advantages of multifractal analysis can be illustrated by previous studies for example kravchenko et al 2000 applied multifractal theory for crop yield topography relationships tarquis et al 2017 used multifractal analysis to study the soil nitrogen content li et al 2018a b used multifractal analysis to disclose the relationship between soil particle size distributions and plantation types gires et al 2017 characterized hydrological properties sewer density and imperviousness of urban zones by accounting for the complexity and inhomogeneity typical of urban water systems with fractal theory however all studies above were to analyze the nonlinear relationship for two variables to our best knowledge the only exception is biswas 2019 who utilized joint multifractal analysis to investigate the relationship among water storage elevation and sand content in biswas s study the correlation coefficients are 0 36 0 06 between water storage and elevation sand content with multifractal analysis biswas contended that the spatial variability of elevation and sand content was actually strongly reflected on the soil water storage across the studied spatial scales and other valuable conclusions soil moisture one of the most important elements in hydrological cycle directly influences other hydrological processes such as runoff production frozen soil generation energy flux between subsurface and surface also soil moisture could influence the atmosphere and soil moisture data sets can be used to estimate meteorological data such as precipitation koster et al 2016 the relationship between soil moisture and other hydrological variables as confirmed by laboratory experiments or field experiment with restrictions biswas 2019 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2017 is often highly nonlinear many studies have endeavored to find efficient methods for quantifying soil moisture and revealing it s change law several approaches have been applied to quantify soil moisture including satellite remote sensing kerr et al 2010 o neill et al 2014 in situ gauge vereecken et al 2007 and estimation based on models bergström and lindström 2015 bohn et al 2013 bordoni et al 2018 however these approaches have their own limitations by comparing different products of soil moisture koster et al 2009 and saleem and salvucci 2002 pointed out that the true information content of soil moisture data lies not necessarily in their absolute magnitudes but in their time variability given the necessity and general dearth of in situ large scale observations of soil moisture researchers have to operate in situ experiments by setting temporary gauging station to collect data sets and investigate the relationship between soil moisture with precipitation solar radiation temperature or other related information ma et al 2017 moret et al 2006 luo et al 2014 sprenger et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xia et al 2014 yang et al 2014a b in their studies only simple data analysis was made skewness of distribution of soil moisture data and precipitation data was not discussed and quantified or solid description of the relationships was missing in this study soil data and meteorological data were both collected in southern tibet near yarlung zangbo river where seasonal frozen soil is one of the most dominant factors of hydrological processes the aim of this study is to characterize the nonlinear relationship of soil moisture soil temperature precipitation sm st p relationship and investigate the role of frozen soil by extending multifractal analysis to temporal three variable data series for the first time multifractal analysis for a full calendar year rainy period and dry period were operated separately section 2 describes the details of methodology including the survey of data multifractal and analysis methods used in this study section 3 provides the results and discussion section 4 is the summary and conclusion in this study our goal is to answer the following three questions 1 is multifractal analysis method a proper way to describe features of hydrological time series 2 could multifractal analysis make up for drawbacks of linear correlation analysis and provide proper illustration of nonlinear relationship among hydrological variables 3 specifically for the case in this study with soil moisture and related variables time series could multifractal analysis method help investigating the frozen soil process in cold and mountainous region in tibet 2 methods 2 1 study sites and data collection soil data including soil moisture and soil temperature were collected at four sites at 2 hourly frequency these four sites were set near a small tributary of yarlung zangbo river china the altitudes of sites are from 3504 90 to 4177 20 m above the sea level table 1 illustrates the topography and land cover of these sites seasonal frozen soil exists in this area and according to nearby in situ measurements the maximum frozen depth is smaller than 50 cm zhou et al 2000 therefore only three sensors were used for 10 cm 30 cm and 60 cm meteorological data were collected at a meteorological station close to soil sites as shown in table 1 four sites were set on a hillslope with different vegetation covers topographies and elevations on a hillslope the redistribution of soil moisture depends on a number of factors such as topography relative wetness and vegetation cover canton et al 2004 teuling and troch 2005 wilson et al 2005 thus sites selected in this study are able to represent the several typical conditions in the study area soil moisture and soil temperature data were collected with em50 stores and 5tm moisture temp sensors from decagoon devices inc rainfall data were collected with vantage pro2 from davis instruments 2 2 correlation analysis auto correlation analysis and cross correlation analysis methods are applied in this study for two reasons 1 to provide a primary analysis of data sets 2 to verify the plausibility of jms there are various types of correlation analysis methods and the simple but commonly used pearson s linear correlation coefficient is adopted in this study lag effects and temporal scale effects are considered in both auto correlation analysis and cross correlation analysis here lag effects reflect the lag time between indicator and response which commonly exist in hydrological processes such as precipitation runoff process chang and tsai 2016 zhang et al 2015 precipitation soil moisture process khandu et al 2016 and air temperature soil temperature process luo et al 2014 etc the original resolution of soil moisture data is 2 h soil moisture time series of lower resolutions are determined by taking the mean value of original series 2 3 multifractal analysis fractality widely exists in nature and is also an intrinsic hallmark of hydrological data sets garcía marín et al 2015 gires et al 2017 korres et al 2015 medina cobo et al 2017 multifractal analysis methods are an aggregation of methods based on multifractal theory which can be understood as an approach to characterize and compare measures defined on space when they present enough scaling properties to alleviate the intrinsic complexity of space and its multifractal measure salat et al 2017 multifractal analysis methods illustrate information ignored or disregarded by prevalent correlation analysis methods often used in hydrology this study extends the joint multifractal spectrum analysis method jms in the rest of the article which was firstly introduced by evertsz and mandelbrot 1992 and often used for one or two variables to three variables namely soil moisture soil temperature and precipitation the scheme of joint multifractal spectrum analysis method consists of 6 steps step1 subdivision of observed time series the temporal domain of data series are divided into smaller numbers of segments for verification of existence of fractal in this study data series are divided into n ini non overlapping segments of the temporal resolution equal to the sampling interval δ ini 2 h 1 data s m ini s t ini and p ini are time series of soil moisture soil temperature and precipitation respectively with resolution of 1data 2 h for each temporal resolution δ the sum of the values of s m ini s t ini and p ini within that segment are assigned to the interval step 2 calculation of probability mass function the definition of probability mass function c i is defined as follows kravchenko et al 2000 zeleke and si 2004 biswas 2019 1 c i s m δ s m i j 1 n ini s m ini j 2 c i s t δ s t i j 1 n ini s t ini j 3 c i p δ p i j 1 n ini p ini j where s m i s t i and p i as mentioned in step 1 are the sum of values of soil moisture soil temperature and precipitation within the interval i for a specific spatial resolution of δ therefore the probability mass function c i s m δ c i s t δ c i p δ is the ratio of the relative weight or density of each segment to the sum of all values of the spatial series step 3 calculation of joint partition function the joint partition function χ is calculated as evertsz and mandelbrot 1992 4 χ q s m q s t q p δ c i s m δ q s m c i s t δ q s t c i p δ q p i 1 n c i s m δ q s m c i s t δ q s t c i p δ q p where q s m q s t q p are called q exponents the q exponents are used to weigh the distribution of variables the q values in a similar term can be explained as the order of statistical moments and be used to characterize the variability by examining the effect of the magnitude of the data biswas 2019 specially when q p is set to 0 a dual joint partition function χ q s m q s t δ of two variables is obtained by setting q s t 0 and q p 0 a mono partition function χ q s m δ of a single variable is got kravchenko et al 2000 step 4 verification of fractal the precondition of employing fractal analysis methods is the existence of fractal of data sets if there is a linear relationship between log χ δ and log δ data sets are regarded as fractal kravchenko et al 2000 if data sets are not fractal fractal analysis methods are not appropriate for investigating the relationships among these data sets step 5 calculation of joint mass exponent function the joint mass exponent function τ is defined as 5 χ q s m q s t q p δ δ τ q s m q s t q p step 6 calculation of joint multifractal spectrum the joint multifractal spectrum characterized the joint distribution of the local components α s m α s t α p versus fractal dimension f α s m α s t α p meneveau et al 1990 the local exponent α is also called the lipschitz hölder or singularity exponents which quantifies the strength of the measures of singularities or local scaling index biswas 2019 cheng 1999 evertsz and mandelbrot 1992 kravchenko et al 2000 α s m α s t α p and f α s m α s t α p are determined after negative legendre transformation cheng and agterberg 1996 evertsz and mandelbrot 1992 and expressed as 6 α s m q s m q s t q p d τ q s m q s t q p d q s m 7 α s t q s m q s t q p d τ q s m q s t q p d q s t 8 α p q s m q s t q p d τ q s m q s t q p d q p 9 f α s m α s t α p q s m α s m q s t α s t q p α p τ q s m q s t q p in the scheme of jms q exponents are assigned joint mass exponent function τ singularity exponents α and fractal dimension f are calculated for some properties with highly skewed distribution or properties are dominated by relatively few high or low values often these statistical moments τ are not enough to express the concerned system precipitation temporal data set with solution of hours or one day which includes lots of zero value data is typically skewed q exponents as shown in eq 4 change the weight of values by exponentially amplifying or reducing the probability mass function c the bigger q is the more weighted high values are and the less weighted low values are and vice versa the reasonable range of q is from to cheng and agterberg 1996 for ease of calculation q exponents in this study range from 3 to 3 at 0 25 increments variation of joint mass exponent function τ reflects the self affinity similarity lacunarity and higher order correlation coefficient cheng 1999 for example variation of τ q for q 0 2 quantifies the similarity lacunarity cheng 1999 as shown in eq 5 joint mass exponent function τ is independent from resolution δ singularity exponent α and fractal dimension f are determined after the negative legendre transformation of τ q s m q s t q p fig 1 is a graphical description of legendre transformation singularity exponents α is the partial derivatives of τ q at q q 0 and fractal dimension f is the opposite of τ interception of tangent at q q 0 range of singularity exponent α illustrates the variability of data for given q specifically distribution range of values is larger for bigger range of singularity exponent α mathematically fractal structure of data series could be totally reflected by multifractal spectrum of fractal dimension f and singularity exponent α cheng 1999 when q s m q s t q p o r f reaches the minimum value and f m i n 0 when q s m q s t q p 0 f reaches the maximum value and f max the box counting dimension of geometrical support and box counting dimension d is determined by zeleke and si 2004 10 d ln c i s m δ c i s t δ c i p δ ln δ resolutions δ used in this study are 1 3 6 12 84 144 360 1080 data which are corresponding to 2 h 6 h 12 h 1 day 7 days 12 days 30 days 120 days mathematically the spectrum of α and f are able to completely describe the multifractal characteristics of data sets cheng 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation analysis in this section auto correlation of soil moisture and correlations between soil moisture and other variables are presented fig 2 shows the observed soil moisture and precipitation and fig 3 shows the observed soil moisture and soil temperature the auto correlations of soil moisture are shown in fig 4 the correlations between soil moisture and precipitation are shown in fig 5 the correlations between soil moisture and soil temperature are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 2 although precipitation is significantly related to soil moisture soil moisture data at three depths and four sites show different variations there are sensible reactions of increment when precipitation happens especially during the rainy season during the first half part of measurement when nearly no precipitation occurred most soil moisture at different depths for all sites stabilized at different levels depending on properties of measuring points which was also observed by moret et al 2006 and wang et al 2017 the exceptions are 10 cm and 30 cm at site 2 which have the most distinct rise and fall of soil moisture soil moisture rises after each rainfall event and then regresses to a stable level or next event soil moisture at flat slope site 1 and 2 is higher than steep slope site 3 and 4 which consist with observation in other studies wang et al 2017 fig 3 shows temporal data sets of soil moisture and soil temperature as shown in fig 3 the reaction of soil moisture to soil temperature is not as evident as reaction of soil moisture to precipitation the main reason of sudden rising of soil moisture during rainy and warm period is not clear according to figs 2 and 3 but there is small fluctuation of soil moisture when no precipitation happens which seems to be caused by soil temperature fluctuation for example at site 2 soil moisture at depths of 10 and 30 cm has similar change with soil temperature at site 3 soil moisture at 10 cm decreased and then increased during the winter of year 2016 as soil temperature fig 4 displays the autocorrelations at different depths for all sites there is no universal pattern about how depth effects soil moisture the auto correlation pattern varies with sites and depths for site 2 the period of possible cycle of auto correlation gets shorter as depth grows half cycle from 92 days for 10 cm depth to 71 days for 60 cm depth for site 4 the period of possible cycle of auto correlation gets longer as depth grows for site 1 and site 3 auto correlations at 30 cm depth are weaker than those at 10 cm and 60 cm the irregularity of auto correlation patterns indicates that the variability of soil moisture is complicated for each measuring point locating at all sites and depths soil moisture series with resolutions from 2 h to 7 days share similar auto correlations when the resolution is 30 days the auto correlation shows different patterns from those with finer resolutions and monthly resolution is also widely used in analyzing the relationship between soil moisture and other components in other related researches long et al 2014 segond et al 2006 xia et al 2014 the negative autocorrelations shown in fig 4 reflect the possible cyclic pattern which has been reported by former studies wang et al 2012 wang et al 2017 fig 5 displays the correlations between soil moisture and precipitation at different depths for all gauging sites according to fig 5 soil moisture and precipitation have weak but reasonable correlations with lags agreeing with the results of xia et al 2014 at all depths the correlation gently increases to maximum value and then decreases as time lag lengthens depth has no evident influence on the correlations between soil moisture and precipitation as illustrated by fig 5 for all sites and all depths the correlations for data sets with resolutions from hours to one day are weaker than those for data sets with coarser resolutions that is believed to be a result of skewness of fine temporal precipitation data set which is beyond the capability of pearson s correlation analysis requiring normally distributed data the lag effect at site 1 and 2 is longer than at site 3 and 4 indicating that soil moisture regresses faster at steeper slope according to former studies the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation is stronger with smaller temporal resolutions from seconds to one hour kohfahl et al 2019 which is in counterintuitive with results shown in fig 5 besides it s worth attention that correlation coefficients of site 2 are much smaller than that of other sites for site 2 the monthly correlation coefficients are 0 261 10 cm 0 021 30 cm and 0 042 60 cm which are much lower than those for other sites fig 6 displays the correlations between soil moisture and precipitation at different depths for all sites the relationship absolutely remains unrevealed according to fig 6 similar patterns are found with fig 5 except two details correlation coefficients among resolutions are closer in fig 6 and lag effect if the lag effect is convincing enough is more irregular for example for all sites correlation coefficient for 30 cm depth is smaller than that for 10 cm depth and 60 cm depth for site 1 the correlation coefficient for 10 cm is smaller than that for 60 cm while for site 3 the correlation coefficient for 10 cm is larger than that for 60 cm for site 2 and 4 the correlation coefficients for 10 cm and for 60 cm are close however as shown in figs 3 and 6 the relationship between soil moisture and soil temperature is not clear as shown in figs 4 6 common correlation analysis is insufficient to illustrate the nonlinear sm st p relationship more sophisticated method is needed to quantify the nonlinear relationship 3 2 joint multifractal spectrum analysis as illustrated in section 3 1 daily and hourly correlation coefficients are small and cannot manifest the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation the coefficients between soil moisture and soil temperature show no discernible relations between them multifractal of data sets in this study is verified for all combinations of q s m q s t q p fig 7 is an example for multifractal verification when q s m 3 q s t 3 q p 3 for all values of q s m q s t q p there is a strong linear relationship between l o g χ δ and l o g δ supporting the strong multifractal of the data set fig 8 shows the joint multifractal spectra of time series of three variables for all sites and depths for site 1 spectra structures of 10 cm and 60 cm depths are similar while structure of spectrum of 30 cm is different the structure of spectrum of site 2 30 cm is similar with that of 60 cm but ranges of α s m and α s t of spectrum of 30 cm are much larger structures of spectra of site 3 at different depths are more similar than those of other sites according to figs 4 6 correlation analysis results of site 3 are also more similar in different depths than those of other sites spectra of site 4 are with different structures and ranges as the pivot of sm st p relationship is soil moisture multifractal spectra with selected q s t and q p were given below for more detailed information figs 9 12 show the joint multifractal spectrum between soil moisture and precipitation for q s t 3 0 3 and multifractal spectrum between soil moisture and soil temperature for q p 3 0 3 as shown in figs 9 12 the spectra structures for combination of sm and st and combination of sm and p are totally different under most conditions site location and depth structures of spectra persist the pattern when q s t or q p changes besides the asymmetry of spectra indicates that there are apparent relationships between sm and st and between sm and p that is the jms method finds the common relationship despite the interference of skewness of data sets and this relationship exists in all resolutions which cannot be fully discovered by correlation analysis weak relationship for sub daily resolutions of sm p and strong but irregular relationships of sm st presented in section 3 1 fig 13 shows the multifractal spectrum with combination of selected q s t and q p at sites 1 to 4 all multifractal spectra show asymmetry and further verified the apparent relationships between sm and st and between sm and p if set q s t was set as fixed value 3 or 3 in fig 13 and change the value of q p the multifractal spectrum does not change much for high soil temperature q s t 3 the range of α s m is larger than that for low soil temperature q s t 3 for high precipitation q p 3 and for low precipitation q p 3 the ranges of α s m are close to each other indicating that when other factors such as temperature are settled there is strong relationships or even one to one mapping relation between precipitation and soil moisture which agree with previous studies wang et al 2017 most of the multifractal spectra shown in fig 13 show the fact that when soil temperature is low autumn and winter and there is barely any precipitation see fig 2 the soil moisture stays low and stable with similar and asymmetric fractal spectrum multifractal spectra with q s t 3 and with q s t 3 shown in fig 13 indicate that in most situations ranges of α s m do not overlap that is the ranges of soil moisture in winter i e low soil temperature and q s t 3 and summer i e high soil temperature and q s t 3 do not overlap indicating the differences of soil moisture change law in different seasons this also indicates that a mapping relation between soil moisture and seasonal factors like soil temperature exists suggesting the inference that soil temperature is an effective indicator of soil moisture is valid in most situations which excavates the hidden information in time series fig 3 and failed to be exposed by common correlation analysis fig 5 the exceptions include site 1 30 cm all depths of site 2 and site 4 30 cm ranges of α s m and f of the multifractal spectrum of site 2 10 cm depth see fig 13 is much larger than those of other sites indicating that the ranges of soil moisture are larger than those for both high and low temperature parts the structure of multifractal spectrum of site 1 30 cm is sort of similar with spectrum of site 2 10 cm but the ranges of α s m and f are smaller besides the low soil temperature part of site 1 30 cm shows conversed correlations with site 2 10 cm negative correlation for site 1 30 cm and positive correlation for site 2 10 cm thus the structure of spectra of site 1 30 cm and of site 2 10 cm are due to different causes for site 2 10 cm the soil moisture declined at the start of winter dec and rise again after rainfall and kept decreasing after rainfall ended suggesting that generation and vanishing of frozen soil may be the reason of such multifractal spectrum for site 1 30 cm the reason may be due to special soil properties at this point that is even the range of soil moisture at site 2 is not significantly larger than that at other sites the jms results manifest the effects of seasonal frozen soil on soil moisture multifractal spectra of site 2 30 cm 60 cm and site 4 30 cm ranges of α s m are very narrow when q s t 3 but the multifractal spectra of these points still show strong asymmetry and indicate the sm st p relationship according to figs 4 5 6 8 11 and 13 correlation results and jms results of site 3 are similar for different depths assuming that is caused by consistency of soil properties and similar soil moisture and temperature change pattern at site 3 the similarity among site 1 10 cm 60 cm and site 4 10 cm 60 cm and site 3 demonstrates that although deep soil moisture and temperature are affected or even determined by shallow soil layer hu et al 2017 sazonova and romanovsky 2003 wang et al 2018 the nonlinear sm st p relationship seems independent for each soil layer the analysis above shows that there is convincible relationship between soil moisture and soil temperature as well as between soil moisture and precipitation for all resolutions considered in this study the corresponding relations between soil moisture and soil temperature are weaker than those between soil moisture and precipitation on the other hand soil temperature reflects the temporal pattern of soil moisture especially for long data series since the effects of soil temperature and precipitation on soil moisture are complex and folded luo et al 2014 the jms method shows its capability of information mining and inferences validation above discussion involves the seasonality in this study thus to illustrate that jms analysis is applicable for distinguishing seasonal variances of the relationships among three variables section 3 3 will employ seasonal jms analysis 3 3 seasonal joint multifractal spectrum analysis in this section site 1 and site 2 are used as examples at site 2 there is visible and convincible evidences that frozen soil exists due to a comparatively long time period when soil temperature is lower than 0 see fig 1 site 1 has the most similar condition with site 2 and is therefore used as control according to table 1 site 1 is about only two hundred meters higher than site 2 and both sites are located on flat slope however site 1 is at the sun facing slope and the vegetation cover on site 1 is meadow which makes ground surface of site 1 absorb more solar radiation and makes soil of site 1 warmer than site 2 in this study case period from 2017 06 12 to 2017 11 06 is defined as rainy period when intensive and frequent rainfall occurs and 2016 11 07 to 2017 06 11 as dry period see fig 1 note that such separation is only suitable in this case for specific purpose figs 14 and 15 separately display the multifractal spectra of site 1 and site 2 with combination of selected q s t and q p according to fig 14 apparently multifractal spectra of site 1 in the rainy period at all depths are similar and asymmetric for rainy period at site 1 ranges of α s m and f α are close for dry period at site 1 structures of multifractal spectra at 10 cm and 30 cm are similar that is in fig 14 seasonal jms analysis gives different inferences from those shown in fig 13 multifractal spectrum at site 1 60 cm dry period is with narrow ranges of α s m and f α which agrees with in situ measurement shown in fig 1 fig 15 displays the multifractal spectra of site 2 in the rainy period and dry period for the rainy period structures of multifractal spectra are similar with different depths while for dry period structures vary multifractal spectra of dry period of site 1 in fig 14 are like part of multifractal spectra of site 2 in fig 13 multifractal spectra of site 1 and site 2 in the rainy period are similar thus the differences between multifractal spectra of site 1 and site 2 in the dry period offer an approach to investigate the effects of frozen soil on sm st p relationship although multifractal spectra of dry period at 60 cm of site 1 and site 2 have similar ranges of α s m there is no similar inferences as those derived from fig 13 indicating the different reasons for small ranges of α s m multifractal spectra of dry period at 30 cm of site 1 and site 2 show totally different structures spectrum of site 1 30 cm dry period is more like multifractal spectra in the rainy period as shown in fig 15 dry period when soil temperature is low q s t 3 the range of α s m at 10 cm depth is smaller than that at 30 cm and 60 cm this may be resulted from the interception effect of frozen soil in shallow soil layer during cold and dry period wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 15 spectrum of site 2 10 cm dry period when soil temperature is low q s t 3 the spectrum shows symmetricity indicating that soil moisture soil temperature and precipitation are not very well correlated under this situation it s the generation and thawing of frozen soil that makes the sm st p relationship complex in section 3 2 there is the inference that the pattern of sm st p relationship is independent for each soil layer by investigating multifractal spectrum of site 1 3 4 and seasonal multifractal spectrum of site 2 suggests that such inference is based on a prerequisite that no frozen soil exists as shown by spectra of site 1 at rainy period and spectra of site 2 at dry period ranges of α s m of site 2 10 cm and 30 cm are much larger than that of site 1 while range of α s m of site 2 60 cm is similar to that of site 1 60 cm this is because that the thawing of frozen soil enlarges the ranges of shallow soil moisture in the rainy period while soil temperature in deep soil layer is more stable and free from frozen soil 60 cm in this case lack of soil data often impedes relevant studies in our study although the sites are representative the measuring duration is only one year which is relatively short frozen soil process has an annual cycle this study fails to provide results about annual cycle because of the short measuring duration but still the jms method shows its great capability of mining more information from limited data in our future work annual cycle of frozen soil processes will be analyzed when more data are available 4 conclusion this study targeted at verifying whether joint multifractal spectrum jms analysis is effective to enlighten the nonlinear relationship among hydrological variables some inferences about soil moisture soil temperature precipitation sm st p relationship were approached with jms analysis this is the first time to our best knowledge that multifractal theory was introduced to temporal analysis of soil moisture soil temperature precipitation sm st p relationship which is highly nonlinear with skewed distributed data and usually avoided in hydrological data analysis the major conclusions are summarized below 1 skewed data sets like daily precipitation data and daily soil moisture data is not ideal object of traditional pearson s correlation analysis method however jms method can be used to disclose the relationship among data set whose distributions are skewed 2 multifractal of sm st p was confirmed which cannot be revealed by traditional correlation analysis multifractal makes further analysis with jms method reasonable also multifractal of sm st p brings a prospect of building multifractal model for other uses 3 soil temperature although not very correlated with soil moisture as correlation analysis illustrated is actually a good indicator of seasonal soil moisture variation according to jms results furthermore relationship between soil moisture and precipitation which has been corroborated by lots of studies was affirmed in this study as well 4 jms is an innovative method to verify the freezing thawing process of soil moisture in a quantitative and solid way which unfolds the complex nonlinear relationship among three hydrological variables since fractal also regarded as self affinity widely exists in nature the joint multifractal spectrum analysis can be a good substitute for correlation analysis 5 multifractal of sm st p relationship is substantial in the case of this study jms provided comprehensive information of sm st p relationship and disclosed the freezing thawing process which was beyond the capability of traditional correlation analysis it s remarked that the jms analysis method introduced here needs more case studies to corroborate its capability further and expand its application fields while the multifractal spectrum derived may differ from these shown in this study at different locations or different hydrological processes more studies are needed to improve the understanding of jms in nonlinear hydrology declaration of competing interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgement this study is financially supported by national

this manuscript was handled by a bardossy editor in chief with the assistance of purna chandra nayak associate editor joint multifractal spectrum analysis jms is an effective approach for investigation of relationship among hydrological variables and is regarded as one potential way to reveal nonlinear relationship in hydrology in this study the joint multifractal spectrum analysis was for the first time used to analyze soil moisture soil temperature precipitation sm st p relationship pearson s linear correlation coefficient considering lag effects and scale effects was also applied for the aims of comparison soil data were collected at four sites in tibet and three depths for each site 10 cm 30 cm and 60 cm at 2 hourly frequency from november 2016 to november 2017 correlation analysis showed that the coefficients varied at every measurement point but failed to provide general and comprehensive analysis of sm st p relationship on the contrary multifractal spectra of sm st p confirmed that the relationship was strong for all measurement points furthermore jms analysis provided holistic results including verification of multifractal of sm st p relationship relationship evaluation for each part of variables separately high value middle value low value intuitive diagrammatic comparison of sm st and sm p relationships etc seasonal jms analysis was adopted to investigate the freezing thawing process in the study area as well the multifractal spectra of frozen soil site and no frozen soil site are totally different for dry cold period but similar for rainy warm period the difference in multifractal of sm st p relationship with and without frozen soil presented the latent application of jms to quantitatively detect the process of frozen soil this study implied the capability of jms analysis in hydrology especially for multivariable relationship like sm st p relationship keywords joint multifractal analysis nonlinear relationship soil moisture frozen soil 1 introduction nonlinearity commonly exists in hydrology schertzer et al 2010 however when there is a motivation to investigate the relationship among hydrological variables multiple linear correlation analysis or multiple linear regression is the first and in lots of cases the only method used ma et al 2018 segondet al 2006 yang et al 2014a b zhang et al 2018 in many studies although the relations among hydrological variables are regarded as nonlinear the spearman s rank correlation is the only analysis tool applied crowet al 2018 hu et al 2014 spearman s rank correlation coefficient is rank based nonparametric size independent and has been commonly used over decades nevertheless as a result of replacing values with ranks rank correlation coefficient describes only the relationship between ranks of variables and misses out details that has become one of the drawbacks of hydrological studies schertzer et al 2010 one possible approach to more efficient relationship analysis of hydrological variables is joint multifractal analysis method fractal analysis was firstly raised by the hydrologist hurst in 1951 and in the beginning the fractal analysis only included monofractal analysis multifractal analysis method was firstly introduced by evertsz and mandelbrot 1992 based on monofractal analysis multifractal analysis is more precise with more detailed results than monofractal analysis multifractal analysis could provide photographic descriptions of fractal characteristics which is dominated by measures and length of measurement boxes by giving fractal characteristics like singularity exponents fractal dimension and so on garcía marín et al 2013 de lima and grasman 1999 medina cobo et al 2017 there are three main advantages of joint multifractal spectrum analysis 1 it could evaluate the correlation of each part of variables separately high value middle value low value 2 it could overcome the obstacles of scale difference and 3 it can characterize the nonlinear relationship among hydrological variables the advantages of multifractal analysis can be illustrated by previous studies for example kravchenko et al 2000 applied multifractal theory for crop yield topography relationships tarquis et al 2017 used multifractal analysis to study the soil nitrogen content li et al 2018a b used multifractal analysis to disclose the relationship between soil particle size distributions and plantation types gires et al 2017 characterized hydrological properties sewer density and imperviousness of urban zones by accounting for the complexity and inhomogeneity typical of urban water systems with fractal theory however all studies above were to analyze the nonlinear relationship for two variables to our best knowledge the only exception is biswas 2019 who utilized joint multifractal analysis to investigate the relationship among water storage elevation and sand content in biswas s study the correlation coefficients are 0 36 0 06 between water storage and elevation sand content with multifractal analysis biswas contended that the spatial variability of elevation and sand content was actually strongly reflected on the soil water storage across the studied spatial scales and other valuable conclusions soil moisture one of the most important elements in hydrological cycle directly influences other hydrological processes such as runoff production frozen soil generation energy flux between subsurface and surface also soil moisture could influence the atmosphere and soil moisture data sets can be used to estimate meteorological data such as precipitation koster et al 2016 the relationship between soil moisture and other hydrological variables as confirmed by laboratory experiments or field experiment with restrictions biswas 2019 liu et al 2013 wang et al 2017 is often highly nonlinear many studies have endeavored to find efficient methods for quantifying soil moisture and revealing it s change law several approaches have been applied to quantify soil moisture including satellite remote sensing kerr et al 2010 o neill et al 2014 in situ gauge vereecken et al 2007 and estimation based on models bergström and lindström 2015 bohn et al 2013 bordoni et al 2018 however these approaches have their own limitations by comparing different products of soil moisture koster et al 2009 and saleem and salvucci 2002 pointed out that the true information content of soil moisture data lies not necessarily in their absolute magnitudes but in their time variability given the necessity and general dearth of in situ large scale observations of soil moisture researchers have to operate in situ experiments by setting temporary gauging station to collect data sets and investigate the relationship between soil moisture with precipitation solar radiation temperature or other related information ma et al 2017 moret et al 2006 luo et al 2014 sprenger et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xia et al 2014 yang et al 2014a b in their studies only simple data analysis was made skewness of distribution of soil moisture data and precipitation data was not discussed and quantified or solid description of the relationships was missing in this study soil data and meteorological data were both collected in southern tibet near yarlung zangbo river where seasonal frozen soil is one of the most dominant factors of hydrological processes the aim of this study is to characterize the nonlinear relationship of soil moisture soil temperature precipitation sm st p relationship and investigate the role of frozen soil by extending multifractal analysis to temporal three variable data series for the first time multifractal analysis for a full calendar year rainy period and dry period were operated separately section 2 describes the details of methodology including the survey of data multifractal and analysis methods used in this study section 3 provides the results and discussion section 4 is the summary and conclusion in this study our goal is to answer the following three questions 1 is multifractal analysis method a proper way to describe features of hydrological time series 2 could multifractal analysis make up for drawbacks of linear correlation analysis and provide proper illustration of nonlinear relationship among hydrological variables 3 specifically for the case in this study with soil moisture and related variables time series could multifractal analysis method help investigating the frozen soil process in cold and mountainous region in tibet 2 methods 2 1 study sites and data collection soil data including soil moisture and soil temperature were collected at four sites at 2 hourly frequency these four sites were set near a small tributary of yarlung zangbo river china the altitudes of sites are from 3504 90 to 4177 20 m above the sea level table 1 illustrates the topography and land cover of these sites seasonal frozen soil exists in this area and according to nearby in situ measurements the maximum frozen depth is smaller than 50 cm zhou et al 2000 therefore only three sensors were used for 10 cm 30 cm and 60 cm meteorological data were collected at a meteorological station close to soil sites as shown in table 1 four sites were set on a hillslope with different vegetation covers topographies and elevations on a hillslope the redistribution of soil moisture depends on a number of factors such as topography relative wetness and vegetation cover canton et al 2004 teuling and troch 2005 wilson et al 2005 thus sites selected in this study are able to represent the several typical conditions in the study area soil moisture and soil temperature data were collected with em50 stores and 5tm moisture temp sensors from decagoon devices inc rainfall data were collected with vantage pro2 from davis instruments 2 2 correlation analysis auto correlation analysis and cross correlation analysis methods are applied in this study for two reasons 1 to provide a primary analysis of data sets 2 to verify the plausibility of jms there are various types of correlation analysis methods and the simple but commonly used pearson s linear correlation coefficient is adopted in this study lag effects and temporal scale effects are considered in both auto correlation analysis and cross correlation analysis here lag effects reflect the lag time between indicator and response which commonly exist in hydrological processes such as precipitation runoff process chang and tsai 2016 zhang et al 2015 precipitation soil moisture process khandu et al 2016 and air temperature soil temperature process luo et al 2014 etc the original resolution of soil moisture data is 2 h soil moisture time series of lower resolutions are determined by taking the mean value of original series 2 3 multifractal analysis fractality widely exists in nature and is also an intrinsic hallmark of hydrological data sets garcía marín et al 2015 gires et al 2017 korres et al 2015 medina cobo et al 2017 multifractal analysis methods are an aggregation of methods based on multifractal theory which can be understood as an approach to characterize and compare measures defined on space when they present enough scaling properties to alleviate the intrinsic complexity of space and its multifractal measure salat et al 2017 multifractal analysis methods illustrate information ignored or disregarded by prevalent correlation analysis methods often used in hydrology this study extends the joint multifractal spectrum analysis method jms in the rest of the article which was firstly introduced by evertsz and mandelbrot 1992 and often used for one or two variables to three variables namely soil moisture soil temperature and precipitation the scheme of joint multifractal spectrum analysis method consists of 6 steps step1 subdivision of observed time series the temporal domain of data series are divided into smaller numbers of segments for verification of existence of fractal in this study data series are divided into n ini non overlapping segments of the temporal resolution equal to the sampling interval δ ini 2 h 1 data s m ini s t ini and p ini are time series of soil moisture soil temperature and precipitation respectively with resolution of 1data 2 h for each temporal resolution δ the sum of the values of s m ini s t ini and p ini within that segment are assigned to the interval step 2 calculation of probability mass function the definition of probability mass function c i is defined as follows kravchenko et al 2000 zeleke and si 2004 biswas 2019 1 c i s m δ s m i j 1 n ini s m ini j 2 c i s t δ s t i j 1 n ini s t ini j 3 c i p δ p i j 1 n ini p ini j where s m i s t i and p i as mentioned in step 1 are the sum of values of soil moisture soil temperature and precipitation within the interval i for a specific spatial resolution of δ therefore the probability mass function c i s m δ c i s t δ c i p δ is the ratio of the relative weight or density of each segment to the sum of all values of the spatial series step 3 calculation of joint partition function the joint partition function χ is calculated as evertsz and mandelbrot 1992 4 χ q s m q s t q p δ c i s m δ q s m c i s t δ q s t c i p δ q p i 1 n c i s m δ q s m c i s t δ q s t c i p δ q p where q s m q s t q p are called q exponents the q exponents are used to weigh the distribution of variables the q values in a similar term can be explained as the order of statistical moments and be used to characterize the variability by examining the effect of the magnitude of the data biswas 2019 specially when q p is set to 0 a dual joint partition function χ q s m q s t δ of two variables is obtained by setting q s t 0 and q p 0 a mono partition function χ q s m δ of a single variable is got kravchenko et al 2000 step 4 verification of fractal the precondition of employing fractal analysis methods is the existence of fractal of data sets if there is a linear relationship between log χ δ and log δ data sets are regarded as fractal kravchenko et al 2000 if data sets are not fractal fractal analysis methods are not appropriate for investigating the relationships among these data sets step 5 calculation of joint mass exponent function the joint mass exponent function τ is defined as 5 χ q s m q s t q p δ δ τ q s m q s t q p step 6 calculation of joint multifractal spectrum the joint multifractal spectrum characterized the joint distribution of the local components α s m α s t α p versus fractal dimension f α s m α s t α p meneveau et al 1990 the local exponent α is also called the lipschitz hölder or singularity exponents which quantifies the strength of the measures of singularities or local scaling index biswas 2019 cheng 1999 evertsz and mandelbrot 1992 kravchenko et al 2000 α s m α s t α p and f α s m α s t α p are determined after negative legendre transformation cheng and agterberg 1996 evertsz and mandelbrot 1992 and expressed as 6 α s m q s m q s t q p d τ q s m q s t q p d q s m 7 α s t q s m q s t q p d τ q s m q s t q p d q s t 8 α p q s m q s t q p d τ q s m q s t q p d q p 9 f α s m α s t α p q s m α s m q s t α s t q p α p τ q s m q s t q p in the scheme of jms q exponents are assigned joint mass exponent function τ singularity exponents α and fractal dimension f are calculated for some properties with highly skewed distribution or properties are dominated by relatively few high or low values often these statistical moments τ are not enough to express the concerned system precipitation temporal data set with solution of hours or one day which includes lots of zero value data is typically skewed q exponents as shown in eq 4 change the weight of values by exponentially amplifying or reducing the probability mass function c the bigger q is the more weighted high values are and the less weighted low values are and vice versa the reasonable range of q is from to cheng and agterberg 1996 for ease of calculation q exponents in this study range from 3 to 3 at 0 25 increments variation of joint mass exponent function τ reflects the self affinity similarity lacunarity and higher order correlation coefficient cheng 1999 for example variation of τ q for q 0 2 quantifies the similarity lacunarity cheng 1999 as shown in eq 5 joint mass exponent function τ is independent from resolution δ singularity exponent α and fractal dimension f are determined after the negative legendre transformation of τ q s m q s t q p fig 1 is a graphical description of legendre transformation singularity exponents α is the partial derivatives of τ q at q q 0 and fractal dimension f is the opposite of τ interception of tangent at q q 0 range of singularity exponent α illustrates the variability of data for given q specifically distribution range of values is larger for bigger range of singularity exponent α mathematically fractal structure of data series could be totally reflected by multifractal spectrum of fractal dimension f and singularity exponent α cheng 1999 when q s m q s t q p o r f reaches the minimum value and f m i n 0 when q s m q s t q p 0 f reaches the maximum value and f max the box counting dimension of geometrical support and box counting dimension d is determined by zeleke and si 2004 10 d ln c i s m δ c i s t δ c i p δ ln δ resolutions δ used in this study are 1 3 6 12 84 144 360 1080 data which are corresponding to 2 h 6 h 12 h 1 day 7 days 12 days 30 days 120 days mathematically the spectrum of α and f are able to completely describe the multifractal characteristics of data sets cheng 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlation analysis in this section auto correlation of soil moisture and correlations between soil moisture and other variables are presented fig 2 shows the observed soil moisture and precipitation and fig 3 shows the observed soil moisture and soil temperature the auto correlations of soil moisture are shown in fig 4 the correlations between soil moisture and precipitation are shown in fig 5 the correlations between soil moisture and soil temperature are shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 2 although precipitation is significantly related to soil moisture soil moisture data at three depths and four sites show different variations there are sensible reactions of increment when precipitation happens especially during the rainy season during the first half part of measurement when nearly no precipitation occurred most soil moisture at different depths for all sites stabilized at different levels depending on properties of measuring points which was also observed by moret et al 2006 and wang et al 2017 the exceptions are 10 cm and 30 cm at site 2 which have the most distinct rise and fall of soil moisture soil moisture rises after each rainfall event and then regresses to a stable level or next event soil moisture at flat slope site 1 and 2 is higher than steep slope site 3 and 4 which consist with observation in other studies wang et al 2017 fig 3 shows temporal data sets of soil moisture and soil temperature as shown in fig 3 the reaction of soil moisture to soil temperature is not as evident as reaction of soil moisture to precipitation the main reason of sudden rising of soil moisture during rainy and warm period is not clear according to figs 2 and 3 but there is small fluctuation of soil moisture when no precipitation happens which seems to be caused by soil temperature fluctuation for example at site 2 soil moisture at depths of 10 and 30 cm has similar change with soil temperature at site 3 soil moisture at 10 cm decreased and then increased during the winter of year 2016 as soil temperature fig 4 displays the autocorrelations at different depths for all sites there is no universal pattern about how depth effects soil moisture the auto correlation pattern varies with sites and depths for site 2 the period of possible cycle of auto correlation gets shorter as depth grows half cycle from 92 days for 10 cm depth to 71 days for 60 cm depth for site 4 the period of possible cycle of auto correlation gets longer as depth grows for site 1 and site 3 auto correlations at 30 cm depth are weaker than those at 10 cm and 60 cm the irregularity of auto correlation patterns indicates that the variability of soil moisture is complicated for each measuring point locating at all sites and depths soil moisture series with resolutions from 2 h to 7 days share similar auto correlations when the resolution is 30 days the auto correlation shows different patterns from those with finer resolutions and monthly resolution is also widely used in analyzing the relationship between soil moisture and other components in other related researches long et al 2014 segond et al 2006 xia et al 2014 the negative autocorrelations shown in fig 4 reflect the possible cyclic pattern which has been reported by former studies wang et al 2012 wang et al 2017 fig 5 displays the correlations between soil moisture and precipitation at different depths for all gauging sites according to fig 5 soil moisture and precipitation have weak but reasonable correlations with lags agreeing with the results of xia et al 2014 at all depths the correlation gently increases to maximum value and then decreases as time lag lengthens depth has no evident influence on the correlations between soil moisture and precipitation as illustrated by fig 5 for all sites and all depths the correlations for data sets with resolutions from hours to one day are weaker than those for data sets with coarser resolutions that is believed to be a result of skewness of fine temporal precipitation data set which is beyond the capability of pearson s correlation analysis requiring normally distributed data the lag effect at site 1 and 2 is longer than at site 3 and 4 indicating that soil moisture regresses faster at steeper slope according to former studies the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation is stronger with smaller temporal resolutions from seconds to one hour kohfahl et al 2019 which is in counterintuitive with results shown in fig 5 besides it s worth attention that correlation coefficients of site 2 are much smaller than that of other sites for site 2 the monthly correlation coefficients are 0 261 10 cm 0 021 30 cm and 0 042 60 cm which are much lower than those for other sites fig 6 displays the correlations between soil moisture and precipitation at different depths for all sites the relationship absolutely remains unrevealed according to fig 6 similar patterns are found with fig 5 except two details correlation coefficients among resolutions are closer in fig 6 and lag effect if the lag effect is convincing enough is more irregular for example for all sites correlation coefficient for 30 cm depth is smaller than that for 10 cm depth and 60 cm depth for site 1 the correlation coefficient for 10 cm is smaller than that for 60 cm while for site 3 the correlation coefficient for 10 cm is larger than that for 60 cm for site 2 and 4 the correlation coefficients for 10 cm and for 60 cm are close however as shown in figs 3 and 6 the relationship between soil moisture and soil temperature is not clear as shown in figs 4 6 common correlation analysis is insufficient to illustrate the nonlinear sm st p relationship more sophisticated method is needed to quantify the nonlinear relationship 3 2 joint multifractal spectrum analysis as illustrated in section 3 1 daily and hourly correlation coefficients are small and cannot manifest the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation the coefficients between soil moisture and soil temperature show no discernible relations between them multifractal of data sets in this study is verified for all combinations of q s m q s t q p fig 7 is an example for multifractal verification when q s m 3 q s t 3 q p 3 for all values of q s m q s t q p there is a strong linear relationship between l o g χ δ and l o g δ supporting the strong multifractal of the data set fig 8 shows the joint multifractal spectra of time series of three variables for all sites and depths for site 1 spectra structures of 10 cm and 60 cm depths are similar while structure of spectrum of 30 cm is different the structure of spectrum of site 2 30 cm is similar with that of 60 cm but ranges of α s m and α s t of spectrum of 30 cm are much larger structures of spectra of site 3 at different depths are more similar than those of other sites according to figs 4 6 correlation analysis results of site 3 are also more similar in different depths than those of other sites spectra of site 4 are with different structures and ranges as the pivot of sm st p relationship is soil moisture multifractal spectra with selected q s t and q p were given below for more detailed information figs 9 12 show the joint multifractal spectrum between soil moisture and precipitation for q s t 3 0 3 and multifractal spectrum between soil moisture and soil temperature for q p 3 0 3 as shown in figs 9 12 the spectra structures for combination of sm and st and combination of sm and p are totally different under most conditions site location and depth structures of spectra persist the pattern when q s t or q p changes besides the asymmetry of spectra indicates that there are apparent relationships between sm and st and between sm and p that is the jms method finds the common relationship despite the interference of skewness of data sets and this relationship exists in all resolutions which cannot be fully discovered by correlation analysis weak relationship for sub daily resolutions of sm p and strong but irregular relationships of sm st presented in section 3 1 fig 13 shows the multifractal spectrum with combination of selected q s t and q p at sites 1 to 4 all multifractal spectra show asymmetry and further verified the apparent relationships between sm and st and between sm and p if set q s t was set as fixed value 3 or 3 in fig 13 and change the value of q p the multifractal spectrum does not change much for high soil temperature q s t 3 the range of α s m is larger than that for low soil temperature q s t 3 for high precipitation q p 3 and for low precipitation q p 3 the ranges of α s m are close to each other indicating that when other factors such as temperature are settled there is strong relationships or even one to one mapping relation between precipitation and soil moisture which agree with previous studies wang et al 2017 most of the multifractal spectra shown in fig 13 show the fact that when soil temperature is low autumn and winter and there is barely any precipitation see fig 2 the soil moisture stays low and stable with similar and asymmetric fractal spectrum multifractal spectra with q s t 3 and with q s t 3 shown in fig 13 indicate that in most situations ranges of α s m do not overlap that is the ranges of soil moisture in winter i e low soil temperature and q s t 3 and summer i e high soil temperature and q s t 3 do not overlap indicating the differences of soil moisture change law in different seasons this also indicates that a mapping relation between soil moisture and seasonal factors like soil temperature exists suggesting the inference that soil temperature is an effective indicator of soil moisture is valid in most situations which excavates the hidden information in time series fig 3 and failed to be exposed by common correlation analysis fig 5 the exceptions include site 1 30 cm all depths of site 2 and site 4 30 cm ranges of α s m and f of the multifractal spectrum of site 2 10 cm depth see fig 13 is much larger than those of other sites indicating that the ranges of soil moisture are larger than those for both high and low temperature parts the structure of multifractal spectrum of site 1 30 cm is sort of similar with spectrum of site 2 10 cm but the ranges of α s m and f are smaller besides the low soil temperature part of site 1 30 cm shows conversed correlations with site 2 10 cm negative correlation for site 1 30 cm and positive correlation for site 2 10 cm thus the structure of spectra of site 1 30 cm and of site 2 10 cm are due to different causes for site 2 10 cm the soil moisture declined at the start of winter dec and rise again after rainfall and kept decreasing after rainfall ended suggesting that generation and vanishing of frozen soil may be the reason of such multifractal spectrum for site 1 30 cm the reason may be due to special soil properties at this point that is even the range of soil moisture at site 2 is not significantly larger than that at other sites the jms results manifest the effects of seasonal frozen soil on soil moisture multifractal spectra of site 2 30 cm 60 cm and site 4 30 cm ranges of α s m are very narrow when q s t 3 but the multifractal spectra of these points still show strong asymmetry and indicate the sm st p relationship according to figs 4 5 6 8 11 and 13 correlation results and jms results of site 3 are similar for different depths assuming that is caused by consistency of soil properties and similar soil moisture and temperature change pattern at site 3 the similarity among site 1 10 cm 60 cm and site 4 10 cm 60 cm and site 3 demonstrates that although deep soil moisture and temperature are affected or even determined by shallow soil layer hu et al 2017 sazonova and romanovsky 2003 wang et al 2018 the nonlinear sm st p relationship seems independent for each soil layer the analysis above shows that there is convincible relationship between soil moisture and soil temperature as well as between soil moisture and precipitation for all resolutions considered in this study the corresponding relations between soil moisture and soil temperature are weaker than those between soil moisture and precipitation on the other hand soil temperature reflects the temporal pattern of soil moisture especially for long data series since the effects of soil temperature and precipitation on soil moisture are complex and folded luo et al 2014 the jms method shows its capability of information mining and inferences validation above discussion involves the seasonality in this study thus to illustrate that jms analysis is applicable for distinguishing seasonal variances of the relationships among three variables section 3 3 will employ seasonal jms analysis 3 3 seasonal joint multifractal spectrum analysis in this section site 1 and site 2 are used as examples at site 2 there is visible and convincible evidences that frozen soil exists due to a comparatively long time period when soil temperature is lower than 0 see fig 1 site 1 has the most similar condition with site 2 and is therefore used as control according to table 1 site 1 is about only two hundred meters higher than site 2 and both sites are located on flat slope however site 1 is at the sun facing slope and the vegetation cover on site 1 is meadow which makes ground surface of site 1 absorb more solar radiation and makes soil of site 1 warmer than site 2 in this study case period from 2017 06 12 to 2017 11 06 is defined as rainy period when intensive and frequent rainfall occurs and 2016 11 07 to 2017 06 11 as dry period see fig 1 note that such separation is only suitable in this case for specific purpose figs 14 and 15 separately display the multifractal spectra of site 1 and site 2 with combination of selected q s t and q p according to fig 14 apparently multifractal spectra of site 1 in the rainy period at all depths are similar and asymmetric for rainy period at site 1 ranges of α s m and f α are close for dry period at site 1 structures of multifractal spectra at 10 cm and 30 cm are similar that is in fig 14 seasonal jms analysis gives different inferences from those shown in fig 13 multifractal spectrum at site 1 60 cm dry period is with narrow ranges of α s m and f α which agrees with in situ measurement shown in fig 1 fig 15 displays the multifractal spectra of site 2 in the rainy period and dry period for the rainy period structures of multifractal spectra are similar with different depths while for dry period structures vary multifractal spectra of dry period of site 1 in fig 14 are like part of multifractal spectra of site 2 in fig 13 multifractal spectra of site 1 and site 2 in the rainy period are similar thus the differences between multifractal spectra of site 1 and site 2 in the dry period offer an approach to investigate the effects of frozen soil on sm st p relationship although multifractal spectra of dry period at 60 cm of site 1 and site 2 have similar ranges of α s m there is no similar inferences as those derived from fig 13 indicating the different reasons for small ranges of α s m multifractal spectra of dry period at 30 cm of site 1 and site 2 show totally different structures spectrum of site 1 30 cm dry period is more like multifractal spectra in the rainy period as shown in fig 15 dry period when soil temperature is low q s t 3 the range of α s m at 10 cm depth is smaller than that at 30 cm and 60 cm this may be resulted from the interception effect of frozen soil in shallow soil layer during cold and dry period wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 15 spectrum of site 2 10 cm dry period when soil temperature is low q s t 3 the spectrum shows symmetricity indicating that soil moisture soil temperature and precipitation are not very well correlated under this situation it s the generation and thawing of frozen soil that makes the sm st p relationship complex in section 3 2 there is the inference that the pattern of sm st p relationship is independent for each soil layer by investigating multifractal spectrum of site 1 3 4 and seasonal multifractal spectrum of site 2 suggests that such inference is based on a prerequisite that no frozen soil exists as shown by spectra of site 1 at rainy period and spectra of site 2 at dry period ranges of α s m of site 2 10 cm and 30 cm are much larger than that of site 1 while range of α s m of site 2 60 cm is similar to that of site 1 60 cm this is because that the thawing of frozen soil enlarges the ranges of shallow soil moisture in the rainy period while soil temperature in deep soil layer is more stable and free from frozen soil 60 cm in this case lack of soil data often impedes relevant studies in our study although the sites are representative the measuring duration is only one year which is relatively short frozen soil process has an annual cycle this study fails to provide results about annual cycle because of the short measuring duration but still the jms method shows its great capability of mining more information from limited data in our future work annual cycle of frozen soil processes will be analyzed when more data are available 4 conclusion this study targeted at verifying whether joint multifractal spectrum jms analysis is effective to enlighten the nonlinear relationship among hydrological variables some inferences about soil moisture soil temperature precipitation sm st p relationship were approached with jms analysis this is the first time to our best knowledge that multifractal theory was introduced to temporal analysis of soil moisture soil temperature precipitation sm st p relationship which is highly nonlinear with skewed distributed data and usually avoided in hydrological data analysis the major conclusions are summarized below 1 skewed data sets like daily precipitation data and daily soil moisture data is not ideal object of traditional pearson s correlation analysis method however jms method can be used to disclose the relationship among data set whose distributions are skewed 2 multifractal of sm st p was confirmed which cannot be revealed by traditional correlation analysis multifractal makes further analysis with jms method reasonable also multifractal of sm st p brings a prospect of building multifractal model for other uses 3 soil temperature although not very correlated with soil moisture as correlation analysis illustrated is actually a good indicator of seasonal soil moisture variation according to jms results furthermore relationship between soil moisture and precipitation which has been corroborated by lots of studies was affirmed in this study as well 4 jms is an innovative method to verify the freezing thawing process of soil moisture in a quantitative and solid way which unfolds the complex nonlinear relationship among three hydrological variables since fractal also regarded as self affinity widely exists in nature the joint multifractal spectrum analysis can be a good substitute for correlation analysis 5 multifractal of sm st p relationship is substantial in the case of this study jms provided comprehensive information of sm st p relationship and disclosed the freezing thawing process which was beyond the capability of traditional correlation analysis it s remarked that the jms analysis method introduced here needs more case studies to corroborate its capability further and expand its application fields while the multifractal spectrum derived may differ from these shown in this study at different locations or different hydrological processes more studies are needed to improve the

6274,nitrate in groundwater is increasing in many aquifers worldwide due to excessive use of fertilizers however the behavior of n based fertilizer as it leaches through thick vadose zones is still poorly understood and the long term effects on groundwater quality in such settings may yet to be fully realized in this study deep soil cores were taken below experimental plots where n fertilizer was applied for nearly 20 years under wheat maize double cropping in the north china plain ncp n fertilizer application rates of zero 400 and 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 were applied to different plots water and n balances were quantified to estimate the leaching rate of no3 n below the root zone and no3 n loss via denitrification transport pathways of nitrate in the vadose zone were identified using stable isotopes of water δ18o h2o δ2h h2o and nitrate δ18o no3 δ15n no3 from the sampled pore water and groundwater the average n transport velocity through the vadose zone ranged from 38 to 41 cm yr 1 and was relatively constant regardless of fertilizer application rate the transport rates are significantly lower than the long term rate of groundwater level decline 100 cm yr 1 meaning it is unlikely much of the leachate from chemical n fertilizers abundantly applied throughout the region since the 1970s has entered groundwater via matrix flow nitrate isotopes appear to indicate that manure and septic waste not chemical n fertilizer are the major sources of nitrate in groundwater to date however stable isotopes show that increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater may also result due to preferential flow in sand layers and or lateral flow from headwater areas denitrification particularly in the upper 4 m depth of soil appears to have limited the flux of fertilizer derived nitrate to some degree however the large n stock and generally weak denitrification potential in the deep unsaturated zone pose a major threat to future groundwater quality the results have major implications for groundwater quality management in the future keywords no3 n leaching denitrification thick vadose zone groundwater stable isotopes piedmont plain area 1 introduction over application of n fertilizer exceeding crop utilization rates may lead to nitrate leaching and pollution of groundwater without improving crop yields liu and yang 2012 no3 n leaching is a global concern as n stock in the vadose zone may be a significant part of n budgets ascott et al 2017 and the long term movement of such nitrate causes groundwater pollution in many aquifers of the world mahvi et al 2005 suchy et al 2018 a review by han et al 2016 has shown that nitrate pollution of groundwater is a pervasive problem throughout china with median concentrations in most shallow aquifer systems approaching and in some cases exceeding 10 mg l no3 n the us epa s maximum contaminant level leaching is considered one of the major pathways of no3 n losses under agricultural practices this is especially true within humid climates and or irrigated cropping systems where a considerable amount of water infiltrates the soil profile below the root zone gallejones et al 2012 growing concern about the increasing concentrations of no3 in groundwater worldwide has generated increasing interest in estimating no3 n leaching rates and understanding the associated processes mahvi et al 2005 rivett et al 2008 wang et al 2012 gutiérrez et al 2018 it is reported that high no3 n leaching rates can occur where n fertilizer application is high and rooting depth shallow halvorson et al 2008 fan et al 2010 in addition to the amount of fertilizer applied no3 n leaching rate is associated with soil properties wang et al 2012 tully et al 2016 e g clay horizons in the soil profile are prone to creating water saturated soil during irrigation or rainfall events and are conducive to retardation and attenuation thus reducing the amount of no3 n leaching to groundwater pratt et al 1972 other factors such as the timing and type of fertilizer application land use type and vadose zone thickness also significantly affect the no3 n stock in soil and nitrate concentration in underlying groundwater mclay et al 2001 dahan et al 2014 robertson et al 2017 suchy et al 2018 denitrification is the major process by which no3 n leached from agricultural soils can be attenuated dalal et al 2003 akiyama et al 2010 there is disagreement in the literature regarding the effect of n application rate on denitrification rate hofstra and bouwman 2016 zhu et al 2013 some studies indicate that n application rate has no effect on denitrification rate because no3 is not limiting deklein and vanlogtestijn 1996 maris et al 2015 in contrast earlier studies suggested that n application rate significantly affects denitrification if the supplied n amount is higher than crop n requirements with relationships approximated by linear regression gagnon et al 2011 lebender et al 2014 and exponential regression ma et al 2010 denitrification in the vadose zone may prevent leached nitrate from reaching the water table however denitrification rates may be limited depending on geochemical and microbiological conditions such as the supply of organic carbon rivett et al 2008 chen et al 2018 thus determining rates of nitrate leaching and denitrification potential through the vadose zone is vital for assessing future groundwater quality risks in agricultural regions this can be particularly challenging in deep vadose zones where sampling can be difficult in such zones both the potential store of n and the time lag between leaching below the root zone and reaching the water table can be significant this represents a major and largely un quantified aspect of the global nitrogen cycle and a potential future threat to groundwater quality in some regions ascott et al 2017 jia et al 2018 some short or medium term field studies on no3 n accumulation movement and transformation through the vadose zone have been conducted hergert 1986 sharma et al 2012 however there are few studies examining the effect of long term fertilizer application 10 years in controlled settings on no3 n movement in the soil profile jolley and pierre 1977 benbi et al 1991 constantin et al 2010 such time scales are particularly relevant where the vadose zone is thick e g 10 m possible long term effects and behaviors that may differ from those observed in short term experiments are thus poorly documented tonitto et al 2006 additionally most studies to date have concentrated largely on no3 n dynamics in the root zone usually within 2 m depth of the surface no3 n leaching and denitrification behavior in the deep vadose zone below the root zone remains poorly characterized harter et al 2005 turkeltaub et al 2016 min et al 2017 deep soil profile sampling following long term fertilizer application experiments can thus provide unprecedented and valuable information in the field of no3 n leaching studies pratt et al 1972 this can allow for comprehensive linkage between surface and vadose zone processes and their effects on groundwater quality on timescales relevant to thick unsaturated zones robertson et al 2017 this is important for preventing groundwater contamination in agricultural areas and managing water quality the piedmont plain area of the north china plain ncp is a high yielding agricultural area with widely distributed farmland yuan and shen 2013 winter wheat and summer maize is the predominant cropping system to satisfy the need for grain production in northern china groundwater has been over extracted to irrigate cropland and n fertilizer was applied excessively application rates from 350 to 600 kg n ha 1 the highest in the world mueller et al 2013 over extraction of shallow groundwater has led a decrease in groundwater levels with a rate of decline averaging 0 5 to 1 m yr 1 wang et al 2009 at the same time major water chemical components including no3 n concentrations in groundwater have shown an increasing trend zhang et al 1996 chen et al 2005 wang et al 2018 many researchers have focused on n stock leaching and transformation in the wheat maize double cropping system of the ncp particularly around the root zone above 4 m depth ju and zhang 2017 zhou et al 2016 however little attention has been given to the n stock movement and attenuation processes in the deeper vadose zone min et al 2018 chen et al 2018 in thick vadose zones which in the region exceed 10 m the soil texture and structure may show great heterogeneity affecting n leaching denitrification and recharge to groundwater for example in well drained soils no3 n may move more quickly to the water table with less opportunity for denitrification plant uptake or incorporation into organic matter in contrast poorly drained soils with high evapotranspiration et and limited groundwater recharge may promote slower transport and often contain sufficient organic matter to support denitrification under partially or fully saturated conditions liao et al 2012 scanlon et al 2007 welch et al 2011 with the increasingly thick and heterogeneous vadose zone below the intensively irrigated cropland of the ncp piedmont plain having been poorly characterized to date the full impact of n fertilizer application and n movement on groundwater quality has yet to be fully understood to address this uncertainty this study investigated the n stock including n accumulation transformation and transport in a thick vadose zone of the ncp by means of deep soil coring pore water and groundwater hydrochemical and isotope analysis below a long term 20 year experimental treatment site the experiments sought to determine the potential contribution of fertilizer application at different rates to no3 n leaching and denitrification rates in the thick vadose zone soils the primary purposes were to 1 estimate the vertical transport rate of leached no3 n through the thick soil profile using chloride mass balance 2 determine how high n fertilizer application rates impact denitrification in the soil using a nitrate balance method 3 trace n leaching flow pathways and identify n sources in underlying groundwater 4 identify the current and potential future impact of n fertilizer application in the region on groundwater quality using hydrochemical and stable isotope indicators this information is vital to future management of groundwater quality in the north china plain one of the world s largest agricultural regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental layout the study area is located in the west part of the ncp in the piedmont plains of the taihang mountains fig 1 a and b the area is classified as a semi humid continental monsoonal climate with cold winters and hot summers mean annual temperature of 13 2 c and average annual precipitation of 496 mm most of which occurs in july august and september min et al 2015 the soil is classified as a silt loam haplic cambisol the main stratigraphy of the plain area comprises unconsolidated quaternary sediments q4 aquifers of the ncp are divided into four groups according to stratigraphic features aquifer groups i ii iii and iv cao et al 2013 the shallow unconfined aquifer in the study region includes groups i and ii with a depth ranging from 100 to 120 m while a deeper confined aquifer composed of groups iii and iv occurs below ranging in depth from 350 to 400 m wang et al 2008 groundwater generally flows from west to east in the area fig 1 b shallow groundwater has been over extracted for agricultural irrigation since the 1960s currell et al 2012 and a groundwater depression cone is distributed widely in the piedmont plain centered around shijiazhuang cao et al 2013 the groundwater water table depth ranges from 30 to 50 m in the study area at the experimental site the depth was approximately 48 m in 2016 experiments were conducted at the luancheng agroecosystem experimental station 37 53 n 114 41 e 50 1 m above sea level fig 1 c three n fertilization treatments 0 400 and 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 respectively were applied annually during a long term field experiment commencing in 1997 each of the treatments was applied to three plots two replicates resulting in nine 7 0 m 10 0 m plots fertilizer n application methods for the treatments are outlined in qin et al 2012 and 2014 which were conducted at the same experimental site the fields were cropped with continuous winter wheat and summer maize i e a one year double cropping agro system this replicates the widely adopted cropping system of the surrounding region of the ncp an n application rate of 400 kg ha 1 yr 1 is widely representative of fertilizer usage in the area all experimental agricultural fields were flood irrigated with groundwater four times per year twice for wheat twice for maize with approximately 70 mm of water applied each time again replicating the predominant practices of the region production activities included early summer machine harvest maize ridging autumn machine harvest and late autumn plowing before wheat sowing fertilizer n was added as urea and applied in equal portions to both wheat and maize 25 25 and 50 of the annual total were applied at wheat sowing wheat jointing and maize tasseling stages respectively extra n inputs included irrigation n which was measured at 14 kg n ha 1 yr 1 by multiplying the total irrigation volume with the n concentration in the irrigation groundwater and atmospheric deposition of n which was estimated at an average of 46 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in the study area by hu et al 2011 2 2 soil sampling and laboratory analysis soil core samples from the surface to 10 5 m depth were collected from the n0 and n600 experimental plots six in total in october 2015 after harvest fig 1 10 m soil cores were then collected from the triplicate n400 treatment plots in october 2016 fig 1 a geoprobe model 54d geoprobe salina ks usa was used for soil core sampling each core was sub sampled at depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 50 cm 50 70 cm and 70 100 cm for the surface 100 cm and thereafter at 0 5 m depth intervals to 10 5 m in total 150 soil samples in 2015 and 72 soil samples in 2016 were collected soil 20 g was immediately stored in an air tight aluminum containers the gravimetric water content was determined using oven drying at 105 c for 16 h the remainder of the sample was gently broken and air dried after manually removing visibly identifiable crop residue and roots the samples were ground to pass through a 0 15 mm diameter sieve for each sampled depth deionized water was added to a 10 g sieved sample at a ratio of 1 5 this mixture was shaken for 30 min and passed through a 0 22 μm filter to obtain pore water leachate all pore water leachate was measured for ph using a ph meter pb 10 sartorius germany with a precision of 0 1 and all pore water leachate was analyzed for no3 and cl using an ics 600 ion chromatograph dionex sunnyvale usa soil texture was determined using a mastersizer 2000 laser particle size analyzer malvern ltd malvern uk 27 shallow groundwater samples below the soil core profiles of the experimental site were also collected in april 2016 to analyze water chemical and stable isotopes fig 1 b stable isotopes δ2h h2o δ18o h2o were analyzed using a laser absorption water vapor isotope analyzer picarro i2120 ca usa the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotope values in dissolved no3 samples were determined using the denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 casciotti et al 2002 water isotope analysis was conducted at the key laboratory of agricultural water resources chinese academy of science and isotopes of nitrate at the key laboratory of environmental radioactivity analysis iaea chinese academy of agricultural sciences the stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta δ units and a per ml notation relative to an international standard 1 δ sample r sample r standard 1 1000 where r sample and r standard are the isotope ratio 15n 14n 18o 16o 2h 1h of the sample and standard respectively the international standards are atmospheric nitrogen for nitrogen isotopes and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes the analytical error is 0 5 for δ15n and δ18o of nitrate and 0 1 and 1 for δ18o and δ2h of water respectively 2 3 calculation approach analysis of the data was based on two assumptions pratt et al 1972 1 the infiltration rate of no3 n was the same as the rate of vertical movement of water below the root zone and 2 the amount of n denitrified was equal to the total n input minus the sum of that found in soil and removed by the crops the root zone in this study was defined as the surface to 2 m depth of soil as almost no roots were observed below this depth for winter wheat and summer corn qin et al 2018 within current agricultural production practices the first assumption is justified as there is a relatively steady no3 n concentration in the water leaving the root zone min et al 2015 the presence of n in the form of ammonia was discounted on the basis of previous sampling results which have shown that nh4 n concentrations are negligible below the surface in soils and in groundwater at the site chen et al 2018 the volume of the drainage water d defined as the leaching water that moved past the root zone of the crops was calculated using the chloride mass balance technique hinton et al 1994 stone and edmunds 2016 as 2 d p c l p i c l i c l s where d is calculated in mm yr 1 p is the precipitation in mm and i is the irrigation in mm c l p c l i c l s is the chloride concentration in the precipitation irrigation water and soil water below the root zone respectively in mg l 1 the multi year average drainage volume was assumed to be constant at all soil depths within the same soil profile this is acknowledged to be a simplifying assumption pratt et al 1972 1978 and min et al 2017 calculated the amount of n leached n p as 3 n p d c 100 where n p is calculated in kg n ha 1 yr 1 and c is the no3 n concentration in the soil water below the zone of root influence in parts per million mg kg 1 the transit time t for water from the bottom of the root zone to a particular depth was calculated as 4 t 1000 s θ d with t in years s is the soil depth

over time may have decreased the soil ph thomson et al 1993 geisseler and scow 2014 although not to a significant degree more than observed in the n0 profile in both cases the ph is lower in the surface 0 3 m plow layer where applied fertilizer and atmospheric nitrogen accumulates the mean doc an important control on denitrification potential ranged from 1 83 to 9 46 mg kg and 1 83 to 4 84 mg kg in n0 and n600 respectively fig 2 b the application of fertilizer appears to have exhausted organic carbon in the upper part of the soils chen et al 2018 lowering the doc in the n600 profiles distribution of soil water content wt at the n0 n400 and n600 profiles showed similar variation patterns with depth fig 2 c d and table 1 wt in soils above 1 m depth appeared not to have been greatly affected by soil surface evaporation and crop transpiration e g did not increase dramatically below the root zone wt at 2 5 m depth in all profiles was high due to the distribution of silty loam soils which have high water holding capacity wt between 5 and 8 m depth was considerably lower as sandy soils are prominent which have a low water holding capacity wt increased between 8 and 10 m depth where sandy loam soils are distributed 3 2 variation of nitrate n content the variation no3 n content in soil with soil depth averaged across the three cores at each treatment n0 n400 and n600 are shown fig 2 e and f the no3 n contents in soil below the n600 treatment were highest with a mean of 32 22 mg kg 1 followed by the n400 and n0 treatments with mean values of 14 28 and 3 58 mg kg 1 respectively the no3 n content in soil of the n0 treatment was stable across the whole depth except the surface soil layer above 0 15 m depth with a mean value higher than 4 9 mg kg 1 however variations of no3 n content in soil of n400 and n600 treatments appeared to be strongly related to soil texture along with a high no3 n content at the top soil of the profile attributed to accumulation of applied fertilizer n above the zero flux plane which is not flushed downwards no3 n concentrations decreased rapidly with depth below the surface in the top 1 m depth for all three treatments silt loam and sandy loam soils generally contained more no3 n than sandy soils fig 2 e and f tables 1 no3 n contents significantly increased with increasing proportions of clay and silt in soils p 0 05 probably due to their high water and thus dissolved ion holding capacity clay and silt the no3 n content in soil was converted into a concentration of the pore water leachate according to the observed water content and nitrate concentration fig 3 a and b the no3 n concentrations in pore water leachate declined from the surface to 0 5 m depth with the lowest concentration levels between 0 5 and 1 m this may be caused by the absorption of n by roots which are most abundant in this depth interval there was a slight increase in the concentration levels at 4 8 m depth with a large standard deviation for the three core profiles of each treatment this suggests complicated flow pathways and possible preferential flow even within the n0 treatment the no3 n concentration in pore water leachate showed a slight increase at 5 8 m depth where sandy soil is mainly distributed 3 3 stable isotopes of δ2h h2o δ18o h2o and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in pore water leachate of soil stable isotopes of δ2h h2o δ18o h2o in in pore water leachate of n0 n400 and n600 profiles are shown in fig 3 c and d the δ2h and δ18o in soil water of the n0 and n600 treatments exhibited similar values with δ2h ranging from 69 8 to 50 0 and 69 3 to 51 7 respectively and δ18o from 9 73 to 5 6 and 9 25 to 5 0 respectively the δ2h and δ18o in soil water at the n400 treatment showed relatively depleted values with δ2h ranging from 82 5 to 59 5 and δ18o ranging from 10 9 to 7 2 the more depleted isotopes particularly observed in soil water at shallow depth at n400 may have been affected by a large storm on the 19 20th july 2016 prior to the n400 core collection but after the n0 and n600 cores were collected this storm even had stable isotopes of water ranging from 14 6 to 10 9 for δ18o and 106 to 73 for δ2h data collected at the experiment site due to evaporation and recycling of moisture above the zero flux plane e g barnes and allison 1988 stable isotopes in water of the upper soils were highest decreasing to somewhat steady values at approximately 3 m at n0 1 m for n400 and 0 5 m for n600 as with the variation of nitrate concentrations stable isotopes in soil water below these depths also showed some significant variation notably increasing between 5 and 8 m fig 3c and d the change in no3 n concentrations and stable isotopes of water at this depth indicates that mixing of different water sources other than direct downward flow and or bypass flow may be occurring in the sand layer stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the soil water profiles of different treatments are shown in fig 3 e and f the δ15n no3 values are relatively low mean 0 2 ranging from 3 7 to 4 1 and the δ18o no3 values were relatively high mean 9 5 ranging from 3 5 to 17 1 for soil water at the n0 treatment these values are consistent with a combination of nh4 fertilizer rainfall and soil nitrate xue et al 2009 the ranges and mean values of δ15n no3 in soil water at the n400 and n600 profiles were similar to one another and higher than those at the n0 treatment while δ18o no3 values were lower over the whole soil profile there was no obvious cause for the variation of the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values although variable degrees of denitrification may have had some influence see further discussion below the variation trends were similar for the n400 and n600 treatments δ15n no3 values decreased from maximum values at the surface to 1 m depth within the root zone while δ18o no3 values increased the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values then both increased to 5 2 and 4 2 respectively at 1 75 m depth in the n600 treatment and 9 3 and 5 2 at 3 25 m depth in the n400 treatment the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values again showed a relatively abrupt change at 6 25 m and 4 m depth for n600 and n400 treatments respectively this is consistent with the abrupt change in δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o and nitrate concentrations in soil water these depths are associated with sand with high permeability and hydraulic conductivity 3 4 nitrate n accumulation stock in vadose zone high n application rates at the treatment plots caused higher total n accumulation in the soil profiles fig 4 n accumulation was generally higher in soil of the top layer above 4 m than deeper depths the mean n accumulation amount at each depth of the n0 plots was stable suggesting long term steady state with respect to input and vertical flux and considerably lower than the n400 and n600 plots with a total amount of 445 kg ha 1 over the profile the mean n accumulation amount at soil of different depths of the n400 treatment plots varied from 44 1 kg ha 1 to 161 3 kg ha 1 with a total amount of 1384 kg ha 1 across the profile the n600 treatment had the highest n accumulation in soil with a total amount of 3517 kg ha 1 and a range of values from 124 9 to 409 7 kg ha 1 at different sampled depths the increasing n accumulation in soil with increasing n application was non linear e g a disproportionate increase in total n accumulation occurred with a rate of 600 kg ha 1 compared to 400 kg ha 1 this shows that increased application of n fertilizer over the long term accelerates n accumulation in soil especially above approximately 5 m depth n accumulation is also demonstrated by the relationship between no3 n and cl fig 5 chloride is considered widely to be a conservative species in soil water and groundwater allowing for differentiation between effects from et and surplus input of excess ions from other sources e g allison and hughes 1983 compared to the no3 n cl ratio of modern wet atmospheric deposition lower ratios in most samples from the n0 treatment indicated n loss to the soil in contrast samples from the n400 and n600 treatments all had excess no3 while the et rates at the n400 and n600 treatment sites were higher than that at the n0 see below et would be expected to cause equivalent increases in both nitrate and chloride leaving ratios unchanged the higher ratios observed are thus attributed to the fertilizer input 3 5 nitrate n leaching speed and n balance the chloride mass balance technique was used to estimate n leaching speed allison and hughes 1983 assuming nitrate and chloride behave analogously in downward propagating soil water the accumulated chloride content in soil should be stable with increasing depth below the root zone when using this method fig s2 the multi year average water input at the study field was 776 mm with precipitation of 496 mm and irrigation of 280 mm table 2 in a previous study drainage volume was estimated to be 200 mm yr 1 through long term 38 years unsaturated zone modeling min et al 2015 the drainage volume in the n0 n400 and n600 treatments were calculated to be 106 96 and 92 mm yr 1 respectively using eq 4 the above ground biomass and grain yield in the n400 and n600 treatments were higher than those in the n0 treatment as the shortage of n nutrient was a limiting factor for the n0 crops et had a positive correlation with above ground biomass and grain yield mueller et al 2005 studies conducted in the same field as the present study implied that n addition increased et by 9 27 on average compared to the n0 treatment over a four year measurement period from 2010 to 2014 liu et al 2016 therefore the et in the n0 plots was less than at the n400 and n600 plots n fertilizer addition hence increased crop biomass with more water was lost through crop transpiration drainage volume past the root zone in the n0 soils was thus greater than the n600 and n400 soils transit times for no3 n from the bottom of the root zone to 10 m depth were estimated to be 21 19 6 and 20 years in n0 n400 and n600 treatment respectively according to eq 4 the corresponding leaching speed was 38 41 and 40 cm yr 1 respectively table 2 these results indicate that no3 n leaching speed is more closely associated with variation in drainage volume and soil water content than no3 n content in the soil fig 4 implying advection dominated transport the n balance for three years from october 2012 to october 2015 in the n0 and n600 treatment soils and four years from october 2012 to october 2016 at the n400 treatment soils calculated according to eq 5 are presented in table 3 and fig 6 since only chemical n fertilizer was applied in all the treatments of the experimental sites during this period there is no item representing manure and septic waste in eq 5 crop harvest n was estimated by hu et al 2006 and li et al 2007 it was established that there was no significant difference in the n uptake and total n above ground biomass production even where there were different addition rates of n above 200 kg ha 1 yr 1 hu et al 2006 therefore it was assumed that the net n mineralization in the n400 and n600 treatments were the same measured to be 80 kg ha 1 yr 1 hu et al 2011 li et al 2007 according to the nitrogen balance the denitrification rate within 4 m of the surface was higher than the deeper layers in the n400 and n600 soils likely reflecting the lack of organic carbon below this depth maximum denitrification rates by anaerobic bacteria are contingent on soil conditions bradley et al 1992 reported denitrification rates in analogous sediments under anaerobic conditions ranging between approximately 0 01 to 1 0 nmol g 1h 1 that were strongly controlled by the availability of organic carbon this finding is consistent with our results namely that denitrification was prevalent in the shallow soil profile below which organic carbon content of the soil is negligible and denitrification rapidly declined we have performed a laboratory incubation experiment to test the maximum level of denitrification by the anaerobic bacteria in this setting for the surface soil 0 0 2 m in n600 the denitrification rate was 5 73 µg n g 1 day 1 this rate declined quickly with depth and stabilized at 1 m depth chen et al 2018 the low abundance of denitrifiers which is caused by low carbon availability limited denitrification in the deep vadose zone chen et al 2018 results showed that 19 7 of input n was lost by way of denitrification in the n600 treatment while n leached into deeper layers accounted for 17 6 of total input the n balance calculations for the n400 cores showed larger uncertainty with less leaching and higher denitrification rates this may relate to local scale heterogeneity in the soil profile and or may have been influenced by the large storm precipitation 137 1 mm in 20th july which occurred before sampling in 2016 the storm caused large variations in no3 n concentration and stable isotopes in shallow pore water leachate indicating possible preferential flow this is supported by the unstable cl accumulation in the n400 treatment fig s2 the n leaching and transportation to the deep vadose zone was highly dependent on soil texture the results of the chloride mass balance and nitrate balance methods showed higher leaching speeds of nitrate in sandy soil than silt loam fig 6 there were strong variations for all isotopic components and major ions depending on soil texture with significant changes observed between 5 m and 8 m depth of each soil profile this indicates that the water source at these depths may be disturbed due to the presence of sand this may provide conditions for the preferential bypass flow and or lateral flow of soil water during rain events this is particularly evident in the increased no3 n concentrations and depleted δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o 9 73 and 69 8 in soil water at 5 6 5 m depth in the n0 profiles because the n leaching rates and n balance methods used are based on the assumption of piston matrix flow the estimated values discussed above contain a degree of uncertainty which should be factored into interpretation of the data 4 discussion 4 1 n stock in vadose zone affected by long term fertilizer application the stock of n fertilizer in the soil is influenced by nh3 volatilization n uptake by the crop the amount of n accumulated in the soil and denitrification leaching and runoff ju and zhang 2017 over application of fertilizer has clearly contributed to n accumulation in soil which threatens groundwater quality it was found that higher n application rates over the long term result in increased n accumulation in the soil profile fig 4 the n accumulation from n0 to n400 to n600 sites showed a nonlinear increasing trend according to an exponential relationship consistent with numerous previous studies li et al 2007 manevski et al 2016 this indicates that over application of fertilizers which results in no additional crop yield greatly increases the leaching of n below the root zone threatening groundwater quality the result also is consistent with a lower denitrification rate observed at the higher fertilizer application rate site n600 compared to the n400 site fig 6 under long term 25 years n fertilizer application the n accumulation in the unsaturated zone of this region is greater than the wheat maize cropping systems reported in other regions li et al 2006 zhou et al 2016 since there was no significant difference in the n uptake and total above ground biomass production hu et al 2006 the nonlinear increasing trend of n accumulation with increasing n application rate may relate to different n transport mechanisms and different denitrification rates under heterogeneous soil textures in the vadose zone 4 2 n sources and fates in soil water and groundwater nitrate isotopes can be used to identify the sources fate and transport of no3 n in soil water and groundwater xue et al 2009 minet et al 2012 according to extensive data collected over the past 3 decades δ15n values of chemical fertilizers range from 6 to 6 atmospheric deposition from 13 to 13 typical sewage effluents from 4 to 19 and soil n from 0 to 8 xue et al 2009 however there are still limitations with the use of these isotopes for source identification as fertilizer derived nitrate is not directly and rapidly transferred to groundwater but rather retained in the soil plant system as organic n and then mineralized and re oxidized re setting the oxygen isotope composition of nitrate mixing and denitrification also modify isotope values minet et al 2012 the large range of δ15n no3 values observed in water from the n400 and n600 sites indicates that denitrification occurs as water is transferred to the deep layers fig 3 e and f fig 7 a and b show the relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in pore water leachate of soil for the three treatments the isotopes in soil water of the n0 treatment were distributed in the region of nh4 and rain and were distinct from those in the fertilizer treatment profiles the mean no3 n concentration of precipitation and groundwater in 2015 and 2016 was 1 9 mg l and 6 3 mg l respectively the relatively high no3 n concentration of precipitation is related to the ammonia volatilization of excessive fertilizer use in the wider ncp nitrate in soil water of the n0 treatment site is thus interpreted to be mainly sourced from the atmosphere dry or wet deposition and irrigation water the δ15n no3 in soil water of ammonium fertilized fields of the n400 and n600 treatments was more positive than the δ15n range of non fertilized field of n0 treatment and tended to cluster more tightly around mean values fig 7 this was likely due to some volatilization of ammonia depleted in 15n during and after fertilizer application leaving nitrate enriched in 15n kreitler 1979 the positive shift associated with ammonia volatilization was most evident above 0 85 m depth the isotopes in soil water above 0 85 m were distributed around or lower than the 2 1 1 line and there was a decreasing trend from the top layer to deep layer fig 7 a and b the different distribution of isotopic values of soil water for the n400 and n600 treatments fig 7 a and b indicate different extents of nitrification ammonia volatilization and denitrification from the different n fertilizer loadings this may relate to the different soil moisture content and heterogeneous soil textures and soil structures table 1 the denitrification effect calculated according to the n balance above is evident at 1 3 25 m soil depth for the n400 and n600 treatments as increased δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values associated with slight nitrate concentration decreases fig 3 fig 7 a c based on the equation of the correlation between the no3 concentration and δ15n δt δ 0 ɛln ct c0 mariotti et al 1981 the nitrogen isotope enrichment factors of denitrification from 1 to 3 25 m depth can be estimated the calculated enrichment factors in the n400 treatment 1 21 were higher than the n600 site 19 0 this indicates that higher n application results in lower denitrification potential again consistent with the n balance results however there was no obvious denitrification trend below 4 m depth at the two fertilizer treatment sites though all samples distributed between the denitrification lines of 2 1 1 and 1 1 3 ratios fig 3 fig 7 a c sandy soil texture below this depth may be a reason for the weak denitrification trends observed chen et al 2018 also reported that limited denitrification in the deep vadose zone is not due to a lack of denitrifiers but relatively low abundance of denitrifiers caused by low carbon availability water and toc contents are low below approximately 5 m in the sampled profiles consistent with lower denitrification rates figs 2 and 4 in contrast to the soil porewater leachate isotopic values the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in groundwater collected from the surrounding region show significantly more enriched δ15n no3 values and depleted δ18o no3 values which are more consistent with sewage effluent and or manure compositions fig 7 4 3 threat of no3 n stock in the thick vadose zone on nitrate in groundwater within over pumped regions no3 concentrations in groundwater in the piedmont plains of the north china plain have increased over the last two decades according to the limited data publicly available to date wang et al 2018 within the study area the no3 n concentration in groundwater ranged 1 32 28 94 mg l with average value of 7 32 mg l which is lower than no3 n concentration in vadose zone the nh4 concentration in groundwater of the study area ranged from 0 36 to 0 38 mg l with some samples below the detection limit table s1 though the excessive use of n fertilizer is hypothesized to be one of the major contributors to increasing no3 concentrations in groundwater there is to date relatively little data to substantiate the source s and mechanism s of nitrate contamination xu et al 2014 han et al 2016 and the issue remains controversial groundwater depth in the study area is currently approximately 48 m below the surface and has declined at an average rate of 100 cm yr 1 since the 1970s the estimated n leaching speeds for the n400 and n600 profiles in this study ranged from 23 cm yr 1 to 60 cm yr 1 and 31 to 86 cm yr 1 respectively with mean values of 41 and 40 cm yr 1 these rates of vertical transport are thus significantly lower than the average rate of groundwater table decline while uncertainty with respect to these leaching rates is acknowledged and the profiles clearly indicate the possibility of more rapid transport via preferential bypass flow our results indicate that it is unlikely the bulk of nitrate leached below the root zone has yet reached the increasingly deep water table in the region this is illustrated by fig 8 which shows that a leaching rate of 114 cm yr 1 the maximum estimated rate of vertical soil water transport below irrigated winter wheat summer maize cropland min et al 2017 min et al 2018 would still be insufficient for agricultural nitrate leached below the root zone to reach the water table this is consistent with the observed stable isotopes of nitrate in groundwater which appear to indicate sewage effluent and or manure as more likely sources of the observed nitrate our results are also consistent with a previous review paper xu et al 2014 in this paper it was reported that sewage and manure were the major nitrate sources in surface water and groundwater in china on the basis of nitrate isotopes although chemical fertilizer was also a source in some regions our results further verify that chemical fertilizers in groundwater are currently not a major source in the piedmont of the north china plain due to the deep vadose zone through which the bulk of fertilizer derived n has yet to travel sources from sewage and manure are known to occur in the headwater areas of the basin wang et al 2017 and may reach groundwater through lateral as opposed to vertical flow isotopes of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o fig s3 for groundwater are mostly distributed near the local meteoric water line with minimal indication of evaporative enrichment fig s3 pore water samples from the vadose zone typically show some degree of evaporative enrichment particularly at shallow depth if groundwater was mainly sourced from vertical recharge isotopic compositions would be expected to show similar enrichment this is consistent with a dominance of lateral groundwater recharge from adjacent headwater regions in accordance with previous research on recharge mechanisms in the piedmont plain yuan et al 2012 another possible source of observed nitrate in groundwater is historic application of manure common in the 1960s before widespread use of synthetic fertilizers and significant declines in groundwater levels were observed travel time estimates determined in this study are severely limited by uncertainties in the porosity of the deep unsaturated zone heterogeneity and variability in unsaturated zone thickness robertson 2017 estimates of travel time through an unsaturated zone of 10 to 100 m range from approximately 5 to 54 years for gravel 10 to 102 years for sand and 59 to 590 years for silt assuming vertical gravity drainage robertson 2017 in the study area unsaturated zone sediments are dominated by sandy loam and silty loam indicating the travel times estimated here are reasonable considering widespread n fertilizer application began in1977 zhang et al 1996 yuan and pang 2012a b it is unlikely significant quantities of leached n from this source could have entered groundwater as the rate of groundwater decline has been faster than the vertical water transport velocity by matrix flow fig 8 a major implication is that there remains a significant store of n within the thick unsaturated zone of the region which has yet to widely migrate down to the water table this phenomenon has been documented in many parts of the world particularly semi arid regions with thick unsaturated zones and it thought to constitute both a significant store of n within the global nitrogen cycle and a future long term threat to groundwater quality ascott et al 2017 although based on our results it appears chemical n fertilizer applied in the wheat maize cropping system farmland has generally not entered groundwater over use of n fertilizer and or manure and a declining groundwater table have created a huge nitrate reservoir in the vadose zone where it is unlikely the nitrate can be denitrified to a significant degree due to a lack of carbon sources zhou et al 2016 chen et al 2018 this is concordant with previous research which also reported indicating little or no denitrification occurring in the deep vadose zone zhang et al 2013 this phenomenon was also reported the weak denitrification limited the n leaching to deep groundwater in other thick vadose area of the loess plateau huang et al 2017 jia et al 2018 the huge store of n thus represents a huge latent risk to future groundwater quality at some stage it is likely that the rate of water table decline will slow particularly if action is taken to limit groundwater depletion as has been discussed for some time in the north china plain e g cao et al 2013 at some stage it is therefore likely that vadose zone nitrate will catch up with the water table resulting in significant increases in groundwater no3 n concentrations future climatic change may also cause more extreme rainfall events that could flush part of the accumulated nitrate downward more rapidly e g during bypass flow events e g zhou et al 2016 5 conclusion nitrate leaching and denitrification are both critical water quality considerations as n application in arable areas has increased dramatically in recent decades to meet rising demand for food this study focused on the effect of long term chemical n fertilizer application on no3 n accumulation leaching and denitrification in thick vadose zone soils within a wheat maize double cropping system in the piedmont plains of the north china plain the total n accumulation to 10 m depth in the soil profiles below plots treated with zero 400 kg ha 1 and 600 kg ha 1 of fertilizer applied for nearly 20 years were 445 1384 and 3517 kg hm 2 respectively n accumulation in the vadose zone showed a non linear increasing relationship with n fertilizer application rate the n leaching speed vertical transport rate was estimated using the chloride mass balance method and was similar across the three different treatments as the estimated n leaching speed approximately 40 cm yr 1 was lower than the average rate of groundwater level decline it is unlikely much of the excess n leached from fertilizer below the root zone has yet entered the underlying groundwater isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 identified that the main n sources in groundwater to date are rather manure and septic waste the large stock of accumulated n in the thick vadose zone constitutes a significant future threat to groundwater quality this is particularly the case as a small denitrification potential was found below approximately 4 m in the vadose zone meaning the large store of n is unlikely to naturally attenuate extreme precipitation events under climate change may accelerate the transport of nitrate through the vadose zone in future moving nitrate into the deep soil and aquifers attention should thus be given to understanding the role of bypass flow during extreme rain events additionally more effort should be made to prevent further no3 n leaching to the vadose zone

6274,nitrate in groundwater is increasing in many aquifers worldwide due to excessive use of fertilizers however the behavior of n based fertilizer as it leaches through thick vadose zones is still poorly understood and the long term effects on groundwater quality in such settings may yet to be fully realized in this study deep soil cores were taken below experimental plots where n fertilizer was applied for nearly 20 years under wheat maize double cropping in the north china plain ncp n fertilizer application rates of zero 400 and 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 were applied to different plots water and n balances were quantified to estimate the leaching rate of no3 n below the root zone and no3 n loss via denitrification transport pathways of nitrate in the vadose zone were identified using stable isotopes of water δ18o h2o δ2h h2o and nitrate δ18o no3 δ15n no3 from the sampled pore water and groundwater the average n transport velocity through the vadose zone ranged from 38 to 41 cm yr 1 and was relatively constant regardless of fertilizer application rate the transport rates are significantly lower than the long term rate of groundwater level decline 100 cm yr 1 meaning it is unlikely much of the leachate from chemical n fertilizers abundantly applied throughout the region since the 1970s has entered groundwater via matrix flow nitrate isotopes appear to indicate that manure and septic waste not chemical n fertilizer are the major sources of nitrate in groundwater to date however stable isotopes show that increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater may also result due to preferential flow in sand layers and or lateral flow from headwater areas denitrification particularly in the upper 4 m depth of soil appears to have limited the flux of fertilizer derived nitrate to some degree however the large n stock and generally weak denitrification potential in the deep unsaturated zone pose a major threat to future groundwater quality the results have

is especially true within humid climates and or irrigated cropping systems where a considerable amount of water infiltrates the soil profile below the root zone gallejones et al 2012 growing concern about the increasing concentrations of no3 in groundwater worldwide has generated increasing interest in estimating no3 n leaching rates and understanding the associated processes mahvi et al 2005

creating water saturated soil during irrigation or rainfall events and are conducive to retardation and attenuation thus reducing the amount of no3 n leaching to groundwater pratt et al 1972 other

2003 akiyama et al 2010 there is disagreement in the literature regarding the effect of n application rate on denitrification rate hofstra and bouwman 2016 zhu et al 2013 some studies indicate that n application rate has no effect on denitrification rate because no3 is not limiting deklein and vanlogtestijn 1996 maris et al 2015 in contrast earlier studies suggested that n application rate significantly affects denitrification if the supplied n amount is higher than crop n requirements with relationships approximated by linear regression gagnon et al 2011 lebender et al 2014 and exponential regression ma et al 2010 denitrification in the vadose zone may prevent leached nitrate from reaching the water table however denitrification rates may be limited depending on geochemical and microbiological conditions such as the supply of organic carbon rivett et al 2008 chen et al 2018 thus determining rates of nitrate leaching and denitrification potential through the vadose zone is vital for assessing future groundwater quality risks in agricultural regions this can be particularly challenging in deep vadose zones where sampling can be difficult in such zones both the potential store of n and the time lag between leaching below the root zone and reaching the water table can be significant this represents a major and largely un quantified aspect of the global nitrogen cycle and a potential future threat to groundwater quality in some regions ascott et al 2017 jia et al 2018 some short or medium term field studies on no3 n accumulation movement and transformation through the vadose zone have been conducted hergert 1986 sharma et al 2012 however there are few studies examining the effect of long term fertilizer application 10 years in controlled settings on no3 n movement in the soil profile jolley and pierre 1977 benbi et al 1991 constantin et al 2010 such time scales are particularly relevant where the vadose zone is thick e g 10 m possible long term effects and behaviors that may differ from those observed in short term experiments are thus poorly documented tonitto et al 2006 additionally most studies to date have concentrated largely on no3 n dynamics in the root zone usually within 2 m depth of the surface no3 n leaching and denitrification behavior in the deep vadose zone below the root zone remains poorly characterized harter et al 2005 turkeltaub et al 2016 min et al 2017 deep soil profile sampling following long term fertilizer application experiments can thus provide unprecedented and valuable information in the field of no3 n leaching studies pratt et al 1972 this can allow for comprehensive linkage between surface and vadose zone processes and their effects on groundwater quality on timescales relevant to thick unsaturated zones robertson et al 2017 this is important for preventing groundwater contamination in agricultural areas and managing water quality the piedmont plain area of the north china plain ncp is a high yielding agricultural area with widely distributed farmland yuan and shen 2013 winter wheat and summer maize is the predominant cropping system to satisfy the need for grain production in northern china groundwater has been over extracted to irrigate cropland and n fertilizer was applied excessively application rates from 350 to 600 kg n ha 1 the highest in the world mueller et al 2013 over extraction of shallow groundwater has led a decrease in groundwater levels with a rate of decline averaging 0 5 to 1 m yr 1 wang et al 2009 at the same time major water chemical components including no3 n concentrations in groundwater have shown an increasing trend zhang et al 1996 chen et al 2005 wang et al 2018 many researchers have focused on n stock leaching and transformation in the wheat maize double cropping system of the ncp particularly around the root zone above 4 m depth ju and zhang 2017 zhou et al 2016 however little attention has been given to the n stock movement and attenuation processes in the deeper vadose zone min et al 2018 chen et al 2018 in thick vadose zones which in the region exceed 10 m the soil texture and structure may show great heterogeneity affecting n leaching denitrification and recharge to groundwater for example in well drained soils no3 n may move more quickly to the water table with less opportunity for denitrification plant uptake or incorporation into organic matter in contrast poorly drained soils with high evapotranspiration et and limited groundwater recharge may promote slower transport and often contain sufficient organic matter to support denitrification under partially or fully saturated conditions liao et al 2012 scanlon et al 2007 welch et al 2011 with the increasingly thick and heterogeneous vadose zone below the intensively irrigated cropland of the ncp piedmont plain having been poorly characterized to date the full impact of n fertilizer application and n movement on groundwater quality has yet to be fully understood to address this uncertainty this study investigated the n stock including n accumulation transformation and transport in a thick vadose zone of the ncp by means of deep soil coring pore water and groundwater hydrochemical and isotope analysis below a long term 20 year experimental treatment site the experiments sought to determine the potential contribution of fertilizer application at different rates to no3 n leaching and denitrification rates in the thick vadose zone soils the primary purposes were to 1 estimate the vertical transport rate of leached no3 n through the thick soil profile using chloride mass balance 2 determine how high n fertilizer application rates impact denitrification in the soil using a nitrate balance method 3 trace n leaching flow pathways and identify n sources in underlying groundwater 4 identify the current and potential future impact of n fertilizer application in the region on groundwater quality using hydrochemical and stable isotope indicators this information is vital to future management of groundwater quality in the north china plain one of the world s largest agricultural regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and experimental layout the study area is located in the west part of the ncp in the piedmont plains of the taihang mountains fig 1 a and b the area is classified as a semi humid continental monsoonal climate with cold winters and hot summers mean annual temperature of 13 2 c and average annual precipitation of 496 mm most of which occurs in july august and september min et al 2015 the soil is classified as a silt loam haplic cambisol the main stratigraphy of the plain area comprises unconsolidated quaternary sediments q4 aquifers of the ncp are divided into four groups according to stratigraphic features aquifer groups i ii iii and iv cao et al 2013 the shallow unconfined aquifer in the study region includes groups i and ii with a depth ranging from 100 to 120 m while a deeper confined aquifer composed of groups iii and iv occurs below ranging in depth from 350 to 400 m wang et al 2008 groundwater generally flows from west to east in the area fig 1 b shallow groundwater has been over extracted for agricultural irrigation since the 1960s currell et al 2012 and a groundwater depression cone is distributed widely in the piedmont plain centered around shijiazhuang cao et al 2013 the groundwater water table depth ranges from 30 to 50 m in the study area at the experimental site the depth was approximately 48 m in 2016 experiments were conducted at the luancheng agroecosystem experimental station 37 53 n 114 41 e 50 1 m above sea level fig 1 c three n fertilization treatments 0 400 and 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 respectively were applied annually during a long term field experiment commencing in 1997 each of the treatments was applied to three plots two replicates resulting in nine 7 0 m 10 0 m plots fertilizer n application methods for the treatments are outlined in qin et al 2012 and 2014 which were conducted at the same experimental site the fields were cropped with continuous winter wheat and summer maize i e a one year double cropping agro system this replicates the widely adopted cropping system of the surrounding region of the ncp an n application rate of 400 kg ha 1 yr 1 is widely representative of fertilizer usage in the area all experimental agricultural fields were flood irrigated with groundwater four times per year twice for wheat twice for maize with approximately 70 mm of water applied each time again replicating the predominant practices of the region production activities included early summer machine harvest maize ridging autumn machine harvest and late autumn plowing before wheat sowing fertilizer n was added as urea and applied in equal portions to both wheat and maize 25 25 and 50 of the annual total were applied at wheat sowing wheat jointing and maize tasseling stages respectively extra n inputs included irrigation n which was measured at 14 kg n ha 1 yr 1 by multiplying the total irrigation volume with the n concentration in the irrigation groundwater and atmospheric deposition of n which was estimated at an average of 46 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in the study area by hu et al 2011 2 2 soil sampling and laboratory analysis soil core samples from the surface to 10 5 m depth were collected from the n0 and n600 experimental plots six in total in october 2015 after harvest fig 1 10 m soil cores were then collected from the triplicate n400 treatment plots in october 2016 fig 1 a geoprobe model 54d geoprobe salina ks usa was used for soil core sampling each core was sub sampled at depths of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm 30 50 cm 50 70 cm and 70 100 cm for the surface 100 cm and thereafter at 0 5 m depth intervals to 10 5 m in total 150 soil samples in 2015 and 72 soil samples in 2016 were collected soil 20 g was immediately stored in an air tight aluminum containers the gravimetric water content was determined using oven drying at 105 c for 16 h the remainder of the sample was gently broken and air dried after manually removing visibly identifiable crop residue and roots the samples were ground to pass through a 0 15 mm diameter sieve for each sampled depth deionized water was added to a 10 g sieved sample at a ratio of 1 5 this mixture was shaken for 30 min and passed through a 0 22 μm filter to obtain pore water leachate all pore water leachate was measured for ph using a ph meter pb 10 sartorius germany with a precision of 0 1 and all pore water leachate was analyzed for no3 and cl using an ics 600 ion chromatograph dionex sunnyvale usa soil texture was determined using a mastersizer 2000 laser particle size analyzer malvern ltd malvern uk 27 shallow groundwater samples below the soil core profiles of the experimental site were also collected in april 2016 to analyze water chemical and stable isotopes fig 1 b stable isotopes δ2h h2o δ18o h2o were analyzed using a laser absorption water vapor isotope analyzer picarro i2120 ca usa the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotope values in dissolved no3 samples were determined using the denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 casciotti et al 2002 water isotope analysis was conducted at the key laboratory of agricultural water resources chinese academy of science and isotopes of nitrate at the key laboratory of environmental radioactivity analysis iaea chinese academy of agricultural sciences the stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta δ units and a per ml notation relative to an international standard 1 δ sample r sample r standard 1 1000 where r sample and r standard are the isotope ratio 15n 14n 18o 16o 2h 1h of the sample and standard respectively the international standards are atmospheric nitrogen for nitrogen isotopes and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes the analytical error is 0 5 for δ15n and δ18o of nitrate and 0 1 and 1 for δ18o and δ2h of water respectively 2 3 calculation approach analysis of the data was based on two assumptions pratt et al 1972 1 the infiltration rate of no3 n was the same as the rate of vertical movement of water below the root zone and 2 the amount of n denitrified was equal to the total n input minus the sum of that found in soil and removed by the crops the root zone in this study was defined as the surface to 2 m depth of soil as almost no roots were observed below this depth for winter wheat and summer corn qin et al 2018 within current agricultural production practices the first assumption is justified as there is a relatively steady no3 n concentration in the water leaving the root zone min et al 2015 the presence of n in the form of ammonia was discounted on the basis of previous sampling results which have shown that nh4 n concentrations are negligible below the surface in soils and in groundwater at the site chen et al 2018 the volume of the drainage water d defined as the leaching water that moved past the root zone of the crops was calculated using the chloride mass balance technique hinton et al 1994 stone and edmunds 2016 as 2 d p c l p i c l i c l s where d is calculated in mm yr 1 p is the precipitation in mm and i is the irrigation in mm c l p c l i c l s is the chloride concentration in the precipitation irrigation water and soil water below the root zone respectively in mg l 1 the multi year average drainage volume was assumed to be constant at all soil depths within the same soil profile this is acknowledged to be a simplifying assumption pratt et al 1972 1978 and min et al 2017 calculated the amount of n leached n p as 3 n p d c 100 where n p is calculated in kg n ha 1 yr 1 and c is the no3 n concentration in the soil water below the zone of root influence in parts per million mg kg 1 the transit time t for water from the bottom of the root zone to a particular depth was calculated as 4 t 1000 s θ d with t in years s is the soil depth in m θ is the soil volumetric water content in g cm 3 the volumetric water content was calculated as the gravimetric water content multiplied by the soil bulk density the n removal by denitrification

by denitrification in kg ha 1 n l is n output through leaching in kg ha 1 3 results 3 1 soil properties weighted average soil properties for the cores from the three treatments are presented in table 1 and fig s1 the soil textural analysis showed that the top 0 5 0 4 and 0 4 5 m soil materials of n0 n400 and n600 consisted of interlayers of sandy loam with silty loam and sand distributed between 4 5 and 8 0 m depth the mean ph ranged from 7 67 to 8 13 and 7 63 to 7 97 for n0 and n600 respectively fig 2 a the generally lower ph in the n600 soils indicated that the application of nh4 n fertilizer over time may have decreased the soil ph thomson et al 1993 geisseler and scow 2014 although not to a significant degree more than observed in the n0 profile in both cases the ph is lower in the surface 0 3 m plow layer where applied fertilizer and atmospheric nitrogen accumulates the mean doc an important control on denitrification potential ranged from 1 83 to 9 46 mg kg and 1 83 to 4 84 mg kg in n0 and n600 respectively fig 2 b the application of fertilizer appears to have exhausted organic carbon in the upper part of the soils chen et al 2018 lowering the doc in the n600 profiles distribution of soil water content wt at the n0 n400 and n600 profiles showed similar variation patterns with depth fig 2 c d and table 1 wt in soils above 1 m depth appeared not to have been greatly affected by soil surface evaporation and crop transpiration e g did not increase dramatically below the root zone wt at 2 5 m depth in all profiles was high due to the distribution of silty loam soils which have high water holding capacity wt between 5 and 8 m depth was considerably lower as sandy soils are prominent which have a low water holding capacity wt increased between 8 and 10 m depth where sandy loam soils are distributed 3 2 variation of nitrate n content the variation no3 n content in soil with soil depth averaged across the three cores at each treatment n0 n400 and n600 are shown fig 2 e and f the no3 n contents in soil below the n600 treatment were highest with a mean of 32 22 mg kg 1 followed by the n400 and n0 treatments with mean values of 14 28 and 3 58 mg kg 1 respectively the no3 n content in soil of the n0 treatment was stable across the whole depth except the surface soil layer above 0 15 m depth with a mean value higher than 4 9 mg kg 1 however variations of no3 n content in soil of n400 and n600 treatments appeared to be strongly related to soil texture along with a high no3 n content at the top soil of the profile attributed to accumulation of applied fertilizer n above the zero flux plane which is not flushed downwards no3 n concentrations decreased rapidly with depth below the surface in the top 1 m depth for all three treatments silt loam and sandy loam soils generally contained more no3 n than sandy soils fig 2 e and f tables 1 no3 n contents significantly increased with increasing proportions of clay and silt in soils p 0 05 probably due to their high water and thus dissolved ion holding capacity clay and silt the no3 n content in soil was converted into a concentration of the pore water leachate according to the observed water content and nitrate concentration fig 3 a and b the no3 n concentrations in pore water leachate declined from the surface to 0 5 m depth with the lowest concentration levels between 0 5 and 1 m this may be caused by the absorption of n by roots which are most abundant in this depth interval there was a slight increase in the concentration levels at 4 8 m depth with a large standard deviation for the three core profiles of each treatment this suggests complicated flow pathways and possible preferential flow even within the n0 treatment the no3 n concentration in pore water leachate showed a slight increase at 5 8 m depth where sandy soil is mainly distributed 3 3 stable isotopes of δ2h h2o δ18o h2o and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in pore water leachate of soil stable isotopes of δ2h h2o δ18o h2o in in pore water leachate of n0 n400 and n600 profiles are shown in fig 3 c and d the δ2h and δ18o in soil water of the n0 and n600 treatments exhibited similar values with δ2h ranging from 69 8 to 50 0 and 69 3 to 51 7 respectively and δ18o from 9 73 to 5 6 and 9 25 to 5 0 respectively the δ2h and δ18o in soil water at the n400 treatment showed relatively depleted values with δ2h ranging from 82 5 to 59 5 and δ18o ranging from 10 9 to 7 2 the more depleted isotopes particularly observed in soil water at shallow depth at n400 may have been affected by a large storm on the 19 20th july 2016 prior to the n400 core collection but after the n0 and n600 cores were collected this storm even had stable isotopes of water ranging from 14 6 to 10 9 for δ18o and 106 to 73 for δ2h data collected at the experiment site due to evaporation and recycling of moisture above the zero flux plane e g barnes and allison 1988 stable isotopes in water of the upper soils were highest decreasing to somewhat steady values at approximately 3 m at n0 1 m for n400 and 0 5 m for n600 as with the variation of nitrate concentrations stable isotopes in soil water below these depths also showed some significant variation notably increasing between 5 and 8 m fig 3c and d the change in no3 n concentrations and stable isotopes of water at this depth indicates that mixing of different water sources other than direct downward flow and or bypass flow may be occurring in the sand layer stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the soil water profiles of different treatments are shown in fig 3 e and f the δ15n no3 values are relatively low mean 0 2 ranging from 3 7 to 4 1 and the δ18o no3 values were relatively high mean 9 5 ranging from 3 5 to 17 1 for soil water at the n0 treatment these values are consistent with a combination of nh4 fertilizer rainfall and soil nitrate xue et al 2009 the ranges and mean values of δ15n no3 in soil water at the n400 and n600 profiles were similar to one another and higher than those at the n0 treatment while δ18o no3 values were lower over the whole soil profile there was no obvious cause for the variation of the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values although variable degrees of denitrification may have had some influence see further discussion below the variation trends were similar for the n400 and n600 treatments δ15n no3 values decreased from maximum values at the surface to 1 m depth within the root zone while δ18o no3 values increased the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values then both increased to 5 2 and 4 2 respectively at 1 75 m depth in the n600 treatment and 9 3 and 5 2 at 3 25 m depth in the n400 treatment the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values again showed a relatively abrupt change at 6 25 m and 4 m depth for n600 and n400 treatments respectively this is consistent with the abrupt change in δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o and nitrate concentrations in soil water these depths are associated with sand with high permeability and hydraulic conductivity 3 4 nitrate n accumulation stock in vadose zone high n application rates at the treatment plots caused higher total n accumulation in the soil profiles fig 4 n accumulation was generally higher in soil of the top layer above 4 m than deeper depths the mean n accumulation amount at each depth of the n0 plots was stable suggesting long term steady state with respect to input and vertical flux and considerably lower than the n400 and n600 plots with a total amount of 445 kg ha 1 over the profile the mean n accumulation amount at soil of different depths of the n400 treatment plots varied from 44 1 kg ha 1 to 161 3 kg ha 1 with a total amount of 1384 kg ha 1 across the profile the n600 treatment had the highest n accumulation in soil with a total amount of 3517 kg ha 1 and a range of values from 124 9 to 409 7 kg ha 1 at different sampled depths the increasing n accumulation in soil with increasing n application was non linear e g a disproportionate increase in total n accumulation occurred with a rate of 600 kg ha 1 compared to 400 kg ha 1 this shows that increased application of n fertilizer over the long term accelerates n accumulation in soil especially above approximately 5 m depth n accumulation is also demonstrated by the relationship between no3 n and cl fig 5 chloride is considered widely to be a conservative species in soil water and groundwater allowing for differentiation between effects from et and surplus input of excess ions from other sources e g allison and hughes 1983 compared to the no3 n cl ratio of modern wet atmospheric deposition lower ratios in most samples from the n0 treatment indicated n loss to the soil in contrast samples from the n400 and n600 treatments all had excess no3 while the et rates at the n400 and n600 treatment sites were higher than that at the n0 see below et would be expected to cause equivalent increases in both nitrate and chloride leaving ratios unchanged the higher ratios observed are thus attributed to the fertilizer input 3 5 nitrate n leaching speed and n balance the chloride mass balance technique was used to estimate n leaching speed allison and hughes 1983 assuming nitrate and chloride behave analogously in downward propagating soil water the accumulated chloride content in soil should be stable with increasing depth below the root zone when using this method fig s2 the multi year average water input at the study field was 776 mm with precipitation of 496 mm and irrigation of 280 mm table 2 in a previous study drainage volume was estimated to be 200 mm yr 1 through long term 38 years unsaturated zone modeling min et al 2015 the drainage volume in the n0 n400 and n600 treatments were calculated to be 106 96 and 92 mm yr 1 respectively using eq 4 the above ground biomass and grain yield in the n400 and n600 treatments were higher than those in the n0 treatment as the shortage of n nutrient was a limiting factor for the n0 crops et had a positive correlation with above ground biomass and grain yield mueller et al 2005 studies conducted in the same field as the present study implied that n addition increased et by 9 27 on average compared to the n0 treatment over a four year measurement period from 2010 to 2014 liu et al 2016 therefore the et in the n0 plots was less than at the n400 and n600 plots n fertilizer addition hence increased crop biomass with more water was lost through crop transpiration drainage volume past the root zone in the n0 soils was thus greater than the n600 and n400 soils transit times for no3 n from the bottom of the root zone to 10 m depth were estimated to be 21 19 6 and 20 years in n0 n400 and n600 treatment respectively according to eq 4 the corresponding leaching speed was 38 41 and 40 cm yr 1 respectively table 2 these results indicate that no3 n leaching speed is more closely associated with variation in drainage volume and soil water content than no3 n content in the soil fig 4 implying advection dominated transport the n balance for three years from october 2012 to october 2015 in the n0 and n600 treatment soils and four years from october 2012 to october 2016 at the n400 treatment soils calculated according to eq 5 are presented in table 3 and fig 6 since only chemical n fertilizer was applied in all the treatments of the experimental sites during this period there is no item representing manure and septic waste in eq 5 crop harvest n was estimated by hu et al 2006 and li et al 2007 it was established that there was no significant difference in the n uptake and total n above ground biomass production even where there were different addition rates of n above 200 kg ha 1 yr 1 hu et al 2006 therefore it was assumed that the net n mineralization in the n400 and n600 treatments were the same measured to be 80 kg ha 1 yr 1 hu et al 2011 li et al 2007 according to the nitrogen balance the denitrification rate within 4 m of the surface was higher than the deeper layers in the n400 and n600 soils likely reflecting the lack of organic carbon below this depth maximum denitrification rates by anaerobic bacteria are contingent on soil conditions bradley et al 1992 reported denitrification rates in analogous sediments under anaerobic conditions ranging between approximately 0 01 to 1 0 nmol g 1h 1 that were strongly controlled by the availability of organic carbon this finding is consistent with our results namely that denitrification was prevalent in the shallow soil profile below which organic carbon content of the soil is negligible and denitrification rapidly declined we have performed a laboratory incubation experiment to test the maximum level of denitrification by the anaerobic bacteria in this setting for the surface soil 0 0 2 m in n600 the denitrification rate was 5 73 µg n g 1 day 1 this rate declined quickly with depth and stabilized at 1 m depth chen et al 2018 the low abundance of denitrifiers which is caused by low carbon availability limited denitrification in the deep vadose zone chen et al 2018 results showed that 19 7 of input n was lost by way of denitrification in the n600 treatment while n leached into deeper layers accounted for 17 6 of total input the n balance calculations for the n400 cores showed larger uncertainty with less leaching and higher denitrification rates this may relate to local scale heterogeneity in the soil profile and or may have been influenced by the large storm precipitation 137 1 mm in 20th july which occurred before sampling in 2016 the storm caused large variations in no3 n concentration and stable isotopes in shallow pore water leachate indicating possible preferential flow this is supported by the unstable cl accumulation in the n400 treatment fig s2 the n leaching and transportation to the deep vadose zone was highly dependent on soil texture the results of the chloride mass balance and nitrate balance methods showed higher leaching speeds of nitrate in sandy soil than silt loam fig 6 there were strong variations for all isotopic components and major ions depending on soil texture with significant changes observed between 5 m and 8 m depth of each soil profile this indicates that the water source at these depths may be disturbed due to the presence of sand this may provide conditions for the preferential bypass flow and or lateral flow of soil water during rain events this is particularly evident in the increased no3 n concentrations and depleted δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o 9 73 and 69 8 in soil water at 5 6 5 m depth in the n0 profiles because the n leaching rates and n balance methods used are based on the assumption of piston matrix flow the estimated values discussed above contain a degree of uncertainty which should be factored into interpretation of the data 4 discussion 4 1 n stock in vadose zone affected by long term fertilizer application the stock of n fertilizer in the soil is influenced by nh3 volatilization n uptake by the crop the amount of n accumulated in the soil and denitrification leaching and runoff ju and zhang 2017 over application of fertilizer has clearly contributed to n accumulation in soil which threatens groundwater quality it was found that higher n application rates over the long term result in increased n accumulation in the soil profile fig 4 the n accumulation from n0 to n400 to n600 sites showed a nonlinear increasing trend according to an exponential relationship consistent with numerous previous studies li et al 2007 manevski et al 2016 this indicates that over application of fertilizers which results in no additional crop yield greatly increases the leaching of n below the root zone threatening groundwater quality the result also is consistent with a lower denitrification rate observed at the higher fertilizer application rate site n600 compared to the n400 site fig 6 under long term 25 years n fertilizer application the n accumulation in the unsaturated zone of this region is greater than the wheat maize cropping systems reported in other regions li et al 2006 zhou et al 2016 since there was no significant difference in the n uptake and total above ground biomass production hu et al 2006 the nonlinear increasing trend of n accumulation with increasing n application rate may relate to different n transport mechanisms and different denitrification rates under heterogeneous soil textures in the vadose zone 4 2 n sources and fates in soil water and groundwater nitrate isotopes can be used to identify the sources fate and transport of no3 n in soil water and groundwater xue et al 2009 minet et al 2012 according to extensive data collected over the past 3 decades δ15n values of chemical fertilizers range from 6 to 6 atmospheric deposition from 13 to 13 typical sewage effluents from 4 to 19 and soil n from 0 to 8 xue et al 2009 however there are still limitations with the use of these isotopes for source identification as fertilizer derived nitrate is not directly and rapidly transferred to groundwater but rather retained in the soil plant system as organic n and then mineralized and re oxidized re setting the oxygen isotope composition of nitrate mixing and denitrification also modify isotope values minet et al 2012 the large range of δ15n no3 values observed in water from the n400 and n600 sites indicates that denitrification occurs as water is transferred to the deep layers fig 3 e and f fig 7 a and b show the relationship between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in pore water leachate of soil for the three treatments the isotopes in soil water of the n0 treatment were distributed in the region of nh4 and rain and were distinct from those in the fertilizer treatment profiles the mean no3 n concentration of precipitation and groundwater in 2015 and 2016 was 1 9 mg l and 6 3 mg l respectively the relatively high no3 n concentration of precipitation is related to the ammonia volatilization of excessive fertilizer use in the wider ncp nitrate in soil water of the n0 treatment site is thus interpreted to be mainly sourced from the atmosphere dry or wet deposition and irrigation water the δ15n no3 in soil water of ammonium fertilized fields of the n400 and n600 treatments was more positive than the δ15n range of non fertilized field of n0 treatment and tended to cluster more tightly around mean values fig 7 this was likely due to some volatilization of ammonia depleted in 15n during and after fertilizer application leaving nitrate enriched in 15n kreitler 1979 the positive shift associated with ammonia volatilization was most evident above 0 85 m depth the isotopes in soil water above 0 85 m were distributed around or lower than the 2 1 1 line and there was a decreasing trend from the top layer to deep layer fig 7 a and b the different distribution of isotopic values of soil water for the n400 and n600 treatments fig 7 a and b indicate different extents of nitrification ammonia volatilization and denitrification from the different n fertilizer loadings this may relate to the different soil moisture content and heterogeneous soil textures and soil structures table 1 the denitrification effect calculated according to the n balance above is evident at 1 3 25 m soil depth for the n400 and n600 treatments as increased δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values associated with slight nitrate concentration decreases fig 3 fig 7 a c based on the equation of the correlation between the no3 concentration and δ15n δt δ 0 ɛln ct c0 mariotti et al 1981 the nitrogen isotope enrichment factors of denitrification from 1 to 3 25 m depth can be estimated the calculated enrichment factors in the n400 treatment 1 21 were higher than the n600 site 19 0 this indicates that higher n application results in lower denitrification potential again consistent with the n balance results however there was no obvious denitrification trend below 4 m depth at the two fertilizer treatment sites though all samples distributed between the denitrification lines of 2 1 1 and 1 1 3 ratios fig 3 fig 7 a c sandy soil texture below this depth may be a reason for the weak denitrification trends observed chen et al 2018 also reported that limited denitrification in the deep vadose zone is not due to a lack of denitrifiers but relatively low abundance of denitrifiers caused by low carbon availability water and toc contents are low below approximately 5 m in the sampled profiles consistent with lower denitrification rates figs 2 and 4 in contrast to the soil porewater leachate isotopic values the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in groundwater collected from the surrounding region show significantly more enriched δ15n no3 values and depleted δ18o no3 values which are more consistent with sewage effluent and or manure compositions fig 7 4 3 threat of no3 n stock in the thick vadose zone on nitrate in groundwater within over pumped regions no3 concentrations in groundwater in the piedmont plains of the north china plain have increased over the last two decades according to the limited data publicly available to date wang et al 2018 within the study area the no3 n concentration in groundwater ranged 1 32 28 94 mg l with average value of 7 32 mg l which is lower than no3 n concentration in vadose zone the nh4 concentration in groundwater of the study area ranged from 0 36 to 0 38 mg l with some samples below the detection limit table s1 though the excessive use of n fertilizer is hypothesized to be one of the major contributors to increasing no3 concentrations in groundwater there is to date relatively little data to substantiate the source s and mechanism s of nitrate contamination xu et al 2014 han et al 2016 and the issue remains controversial groundwater depth in the study area is currently approximately 48 m below the surface and has declined at an average rate of 100 cm yr 1 since the 1970s the estimated n leaching speeds for the n400 and n600 profiles in this study ranged from 23 cm yr 1 to 60 cm yr 1 and 31 to 86 cm yr 1 respectively with mean values of 41 and 40 cm yr 1 these rates of vertical transport are thus significantly lower than the average rate of groundwater table decline while uncertainty with respect to these leaching rates is acknowledged and the profiles clearly indicate the possibility of more rapid transport via preferential bypass flow our results indicate that it is unlikely the bulk of nitrate leached below the root zone has yet reached the increasingly deep water table in the region this is illustrated by fig 8 which shows that a leaching rate of 114 cm yr 1 the maximum estimated rate of vertical soil water transport below irrigated winter wheat summer maize cropland min et al 2017 min et al 2018 would still be insufficient for agricultural nitrate leached below the root zone to reach the water table this is consistent with the observed stable isotopes of nitrate in groundwater which appear to indicate sewage effluent and or manure as more likely sources of the observed nitrate our results are also consistent with a previous review paper xu et al 2014 in this paper it was reported that sewage and manure were the major nitrate sources in surface water and groundwater in china on the basis of nitrate isotopes although chemical fertilizer was also a source in some regions our results further verify that chemical fertilizers in groundwater are currently not a major source in the piedmont of the north china plain due to the deep vadose zone through which the bulk of fertilizer derived n has yet to travel sources from sewage and manure are known to occur in the headwater areas of the basin wang et al 2017 and may reach groundwater through lateral as opposed to vertical flow isotopes of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o fig s3 for groundwater are mostly distributed near the local meteoric water line with minimal indication of evaporative enrichment fig s3 pore water samples from the vadose zone typically show some degree of evaporative enrichment particularly at shallow depth if groundwater was mainly sourced from vertical recharge isotopic compositions would be expected to show similar enrichment this is consistent with a dominance of lateral groundwater recharge from adjacent headwater regions in accordance with previous research on recharge mechanisms in the piedmont plain yuan et al 2012 another possible source of observed nitrate in groundwater is historic application of manure common in the 1960s before widespread use of synthetic fertilizers and significant declines in groundwater levels were observed travel time estimates determined in this study are severely limited by uncertainties in the porosity of the deep unsaturated zone heterogeneity and variability in unsaturated zone thickness robertson 2017 estimates of travel time through an unsaturated zone of 10 to 100 m range from approximately 5 to 54 years for gravel 10 to 102 years for sand and 59 to 590 years for silt assuming vertical gravity drainage robertson 2017 in the study area unsaturated zone sediments are dominated by sandy loam and silty loam indicating the travel times estimated here are reasonable considering widespread n fertilizer application began in1977 zhang et al 1996 yuan and pang 2012a b it is unlikely significant quantities of leached n from this source could have entered groundwater as the rate of groundwater decline has been faster than the vertical water transport velocity by matrix flow fig 8 a major implication is that there remains a significant store of n within the thick unsaturated zone of the region which has yet to widely migrate down to the water table this phenomenon has been documented in many parts of the world particularly semi arid regions with thick unsaturated zones and it thought to constitute both a significant store of n within the global nitrogen cycle and a future long term threat to groundwater quality ascott et al 2017 although based on our results it appears chemical n fertilizer applied in the wheat maize cropping system farmland has generally not entered groundwater over use of n fertilizer and or manure and a declining groundwater table have created a huge nitrate reservoir in the vadose zone where it is unlikely the nitrate can be denitrified to a significant degree due to a lack of carbon sources zhou et al 2016 chen et al 2018 this is concordant with previous research which also reported indicating little or no denitrification occurring in the deep vadose zone zhang et al 2013 this phenomenon was also reported the weak denitrification limited the n leaching to deep groundwater in other thick vadose area of the loess plateau huang et al 2017 jia et al 2018 the huge store of n thus represents a huge latent risk to future groundwater quality at some stage it is likely that the rate of water table decline will slow particularly if action is taken to limit groundwater depletion as has been discussed for some time in the north china plain e g cao et al 2013 at some stage it is therefore likely that vadose zone nitrate will catch up with the water table resulting in significant increases in groundwater no3 n concentrations future climatic change may also cause more extreme rainfall events that could flush part of the accumulated nitrate downward more rapidly e g during bypass flow events e g zhou et al 2016 5 conclusion nitrate leaching and denitrification are both critical water quality considerations as n application in arable areas has increased dramatically in recent decades to meet rising demand for food this study focused on the effect of long term chemical n fertilizer application on no3 n accumulation leaching and denitrification in thick vadose zone soils within a wheat maize double cropping system in the piedmont plains of the north china plain the total n accumulation to 10 m depth in the soil profiles below plots treated with zero 400 kg ha 1 and 600 kg ha 1 of fertilizer applied for nearly 20 years were 445 1384 and 3517 kg hm 2 respectively n accumulation in the vadose zone showed a non linear increasing relationship with n fertilizer application rate the n leaching speed vertical transport rate was estimated using the chloride mass balance method and was similar across the three different treatments as the estimated n leaching speed approximately 40 cm yr 1 was lower than the average rate of groundwater level decline it is unlikely much of the excess n leached from fertilizer below the root zone has yet entered the underlying groundwater isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 identified that the main n sources in groundwater to date are rather manure and septic waste the large stock of accumulated n in the thick vadose zone constitutes a significant future threat to groundwater quality this is particularly the case as a small denitrification potential was found below approximately 4 m in the vadose zone meaning the large store of n is unlikely to naturally attenuate extreme precipitation events under climate change may accelerate the transport of nitrate through the vadose zone in future moving nitrate into the deep soil and aquifers attention should thus be given to understanding the role of bypass flow during extreme rain events additionally more effort should be made to prevent further no3 n leaching to the vadose zone
