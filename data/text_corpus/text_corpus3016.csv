15080,bioconversion of nutrients and energy from landfill leachate ll to biohydrogen and volatile fatty acids vfas using dark fermentation df is a promising technique for developing a sustainable ecosystem however poor performance of df caused by vulnerable fermentative bacteria vitality and strong ll toxicity significantly hinder its commercialization herein an integrated technique linking microalgae photosynthesis and df was proposed in which mixed microalgae were applied to robustly reclaim nutrients and chemical oxygen demand cod from ll then microalgae biomass was fermented into biohydrogen and vfas using the df process underlying synergistic mechanisms of the interaction of scenedesmus obliquus and chlorella vulgaris resulting from the functioning of extracellular polymeric substances eps were discussed in detail for better absorption of nutrients from ll the mixed microalgae secreted obviously more eps than pure microalgae which played vital roles in the assimilation of cellular nutrients by forming more negative zeta potential and secreting more tyrosine tryptophan family proteins in eps besides mixed microalgae produced more intracellular proteins and carbohydrates than the pure microalgae thereby providing more feedstock for df and achieving higher energy yield of 10 80 kj l than 6 64 kj l that was obtained when pure microalgae were used moreover the energy conversion efficiency of 7 75 was higher for mixed microalgae than 4 77 that was obtained for pure microalgae this work may inspire efficient disposal of ll and production of bioenergy together with filling the knowledge gaps of synergistic mechanisms of dual microalgal interactions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords landfill leachate dark fermentation microalgae extracellular polymeric substances biohydrogen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the past few decades rapid urbanization has produced vast amounts of solid wastes much of these wastes are buried as landfills which unfortunately generates large quantities of landfill leachate ll lin et al 2021 direct discharge of ll can cause serious pollution of aquatic environment which is attributed to high concentrations of inorganics and toxic organics shadi et al 2022 mature ll usually contains more than 50 types of refractory organics and over 30 000 ppm inorganics bringing along the challenge of safe disposal of these waste materials wijekoon et al 2022 current methods to treat ll can mainly be divided into three categories of physical chemical and biological technologies and include adsorption using activated carbon membrane filtration advanced oxidation processes and bioremediation using activated sludge li et al 2019 shen et al 2021 however these technologies are suffering from technical bottlenecks such as high energy consumption risk of secondary pollution and poor treatment efficiency wu et al 2023 besides available approaches for disposing ll mainly focus on the removal of pollutants from water streams however little focus has been given to the reuse and recycle of energy and nutrients abundant valuable resources such as nitrogen phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand cod contained in ll are wasted paiva et al 2021 as is well known energy shortage is another key issue facing humanity therefore exploring renewable and eco friendly energy alternatives to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and achieve carbon neutrality is of great significance jia et al 2020 hydrogen is an ideal alternative fuel due to its inherent advantages of high energy density and clean combustion products h2o converting hidden energy and resources from ll to biohydrogen using dark fermentation df can simultaneously achieve safe disposal of ll while producing energy with added advantages of producing volatile fatty acids vfas during the process which are platform molecules for producing biochemicals and biofuels such as polyhydroxyalkanoate and biomethane slezak et al 2017 however the production of biohydrogen and vfas using ll as the df medium still faces great challenges including low energy conversion efficiency ece and poor economic feasibility pastor et al 2013 reported that the production rate of only 0 16 ml h2 g vs day was achieved with less than 40 removal of the volatile solids using oils and landfill leachates as the df substrate resulting in a poor maximum h2 yield of about 15 3 ml h2 g vs which is ascribed to the vulnerable activity of hydrogen producing bacteria hpb due to the strong toxicity of ll originating from abundant refractory organics and inorganics cao et al 2022 instead of hpb photosynthetic microalgae are potential alternatives for recovering nutrients and energy form ll due to their strong immunity li et al 2022 microalgae can reclaim organics nitrogen and phosphorus from ll and convert them into intracellular carbohydrates and proteins used as ideal df feedstock for producing biohydrogen zhang et al 2021 therefore the cooperation of microalgae and hpb by linking light and dark bio reactions is a promising approach for efficient bioremediation of ll and production of bioenergy feng et al 2022 during the process intrinsic properties of microalgae strains play a crucial role in the disposal of ll and the conversion of bioenergy ahmed et al 2022 on the one hand cellular tolerance to environmental stress and nutrients recovery obviously varies with microalgae species due to different physiological responses which lead to distinct ll treatment performance khanzada and Ã¶vez 2017 on the other hand microalgae cellular metabolism can change sharply due to strains which may provide different compositions of feedstock for df thus resulting in distinct yields of products feng et al 2022 until now researchers have successfully realized microalgae based ll bioremediation achieving as high as 48 1 nitrogen recovery efficiency chang et al 2018 however the up to date approaches are mostly conducted using pure microalgae strains on laboratory scale which is different from using mixed microalgae strains in practical applications in practice microalgae usually appear as mixed strains in highly polluted environments which can provide robust growth profiles that are attributed to specific physiological responses among various species luo et al 2020 hu et al 2021 stated that the dual species microalgae system of chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus dimorphus had a considerably higher biomass density nutrients removal efficiency as well as the production of carbohydrates and proteins than the mono species microalgae system during ll treatment however the unclear mechanisms about the interactions of mixed microalgae species and their impact on the adsorption of nutrients and accumulation of biomass in particularly the important role of eps in the adsorption of nutrients have limited our understanding and optimization of ll bioremediation using microalgae in short how the different compositions of mixed microalgae species impact the downstream df processes for producing bioenergy are also unclear these gaps in knowledge significantly hinder the large scale application of microalgae based ll treatment and bioenergy production processes in this work photosynthesis of microalgae and df were serially linked for efficient treatment of ll and conversion of bioenergy fig 1 the mixed microalgae species of c vulgaris cv and scenedesmus obliquus so were used to reclaim nutrients and energy from ll and relied on the robust activity of microalgae under stress environment the underlying synergistic effects of dual microalgal interactions were studied in detail using three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy 3d eem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir the metabolism of the mixed microalgae and its influence on the df process were revealed moreover the energy conversion pathways for ll s conversion to biohydrogen and vfas were comprehensively studied in particular the roles of eps in the adsorption of nutrients and growth of microalgae were emphasized in the mixed microalgae system the goals of this study include 1 achieving efficient ll bioremediation and bioenergy production by linking microalgae photosynthesis with df 2 analyzing underlying synergistic mechanisms of dual microalgae interactions and their impact on ll treatment and bioenergy production 3 evaluating the ece from ll to bioproducts biohydrogen and vfas by linking light and dark bio reactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 landfill leachate ll the ll was obtained from sanwei environmental protection co ltd chongqing china the municipal landfill operation has been running for over 10 years indicating that the adopted ll belonged to mature ll detailed parameters about the ll are presented in table 1 2 2 microalgae strains and activated sludge microalgae strains of c vulgaris cv and s obliquus so were purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences in wuhan china both the cv and so were selected due to their superior growth characteristics as well as high contents of protein and carbohydrate the strains were pre cultivated in bg 11 medium according to the method detailed in a previous study chang et al 2022 activated sludge granules containing hpb were purchased from li bo yuan environmental materials co ltd shandong china 2 3 bioremediation of landfill leachate using dual microalgae cultivation ll bioremediation with dual microalgae strains was carried out in 500 ml glass flasks prior to this the suspended solids in the original ll were removed using centrifugation tg16 ws hunan xiangyi laboratory instrument development china initially 67 5 ml of the original ll was mixed in 382 5 ml deionized water to obtain a 15 diluted ll v v total inoculation density of microalgae was controlled at 0 1 g l for all the groups with the so cv concentration ratios of 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 respectively no domestications on microalgae species were conducted before the bioremediation of ll experiments all groups were sterilized at 121 c for 20 min using an autoclave bxm

performed in triplicates 2 4 dark fermentation the dark fermentation was conducted according to the method given by feng et al 2022 as shown in fig s1 supplementary information si during the process microalgae biomass collected from ll medium was dissolved into 100 ml deionized water and pretreated in an autoclave with 1 h2so4 to break the cell wall of microalgae subsequently 125 ml deionized water and 5 g anaerobic activated sludge granules were injected into the glass fermenter for df with the initial ph of 6 0 0 1 all bottles were carefully sealed with bottle caps and purged with n2 for 10 min to form anaerobic environment these bottles were placed into the thermostatic water bath at 35 0 1 c to produce biohydrogen and vfas 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 macromolecular organics in ll

microalgae lb eps and tb eps were measured using a zeta analyzer zetasizer nano zs nano particle size potentiometer malvern instruments ltd uk compositions of eps were determined using a 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy lumina thermo fisher usa before the analysis all samples were filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m microporous membrane to remove suspended solids chemical bonds of eps extracted from the microalgal suspension were detected using ft ir nico let380 thermo usa before the ft ir analysis the pristine eps solution was dried in a vacuum freeze dryer for 48 h after careful grinding the eps sample was mixed with finely divided kbr in a ratio of 1 100 moreover ft ir spectra were acquired by accumulating 200 scans within the range of 400 4000 cm 1 with the resolution of 4 cm 1 2 5 6

total output energy w3 in kj during df is calculated using eq 10 10 w 3 k j e v o l u m e t r i c v 2 ece of conversion process from ll to microalgal biomass was named as ece1 2 and equaled to w2 w1 additionally ece from microalgal biomass to biohydrogen and vfas during df was named as ece2 3 which equaled to w3 w2 moreover ece of the whole process from ll to bioproducts biohydrogen and vfas integrating microalgal photosynthesis and df steps was named as ece1 3 and equaled to w3 w1 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of ll the composition of the original ll is presented in table 1 which indicated that high concentrations of cod 4997 78 49 80 mg l and nh4 1549 49 40 43 mg l and high chromaticity 1150 100 pt co were observed in the ll this could cause severe toxicity on hpb especially for the extortionate nondegradable macromolecular organics as seen in fig 2 more than 14 types of macromolecular organics were detected with phenol 2587 68 mg l docosenamide 821 59 mg l and hydroxyphenylpropionic acid 500 21 mg l as the three major components these macromolecular organics especially the phenol may cause strong inhibitory effects on the activity of hpb for generating biohydrogen cao et al 2022 beside the macromolecular organics high nh4 concentration is another inhibitor to the activity of hpb which can not only damage c n balance of the feedstock but can also cause n poisoning for hpb which is attributed to nitrogen luxury uptake by hpb cells chang et al 2020 therefore it can be inferred that the ll was adverse in nature for producing biohydrogen and vfas using df process 3 2 synergistic effects of dual microalgal interactions on the accumulation of biomass and bioremediation of ll 3 2 1 performances of mixed microalgae growth and ll treatment considering the difficulty of ll disposal by dark fermentative hpb the photosynthetic microalgae with high robustness were first applied to recover nutrients and energy from ll the performances of biomass growth chlorophyll synthesis cod and nutrients removal by mixed microalgae under various so cv ratios are shown in figs 3 and s1 the results showed that the mixed microalgae had higher growth profile over pure so or cv groups i e so cv 1 0 or 0 1 the highest biomass concentration of 1 29 g l was achieved for the mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 indicating improvements of 29 00 and 20 56 compared to pure cv so cv 0 1 and pure so so cv 1 0 respectively fig 3a besides the maximum chlorophyll concentration of 94 07 mg l was also obtained under the so cv of 1 1 which was ca 40 higher than that obtained using the pure microalgae fig 3b these results demonstrated that some underlying synergistic effects between the so and cv existed in the mixed microalgae system with the so cv of 1 1 which triggered a more active photosynthesis than the pure microalgae groups during the bioremediation of ll chemical oxygen demand cod and the removal of nh4 in different groups are shown in fig 3c d the results showed that the highest cod and nh4 removals were obtained under the so cv of 1 1 with the values of 227 90 mg l and 104 13 mg l respectively the cod removals in cv and so were only 84 28 and 132 27 mg l which were 50 less than that for the so cv of 1 1 besides the removal of nh4 for pure microalgae was also much less than that for the mixed microalgae with the value of 78 34 mg l nh4 removal for the so cv of 0 1 and 90 24 mg l for the so cv of 1 0 as a result the maximum removal efficiencies of 32 42 and 47 16 were obtained for cod and nh4 in the so cv of 1 1 table s1 suggesting that the vigorous growth profiles of mixed microalgae for the so cv of 1 1 endowed microalgal cells with the capability to assimilate more cod and nh4 during ll treatment however the underlying mechanisms of synergistic effects between microalgal so and cv are unclear it is noteworthy that no3 and po4 3 concentrations in all the groups were completely depleted after day 1 fig s2 which may be attributed to low initial concentrations 3 2 2 insights into the effect of eps on the dual microalgal interaction to reveal the synergistic mechanisms of dual microalgal interactions between so and cv the microalgal eps concentration surface zeta potential eps composition and chemical bonds intensity are illustrated in fig 4 and tables 2 3 the results showed that the mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 had higher eps content higher contents of tyrosine tryptophan family proteins and more negative zeta potential than the pure microalgae with the so cv of 1 0 or 0 1 meanwhile the mixed microalgae had much lower chemical bonds intensity of eps than the pure microalgae it can be hypothesized that the eps may have played a vital role in the adsorption of cod and nh4 which can trigger more active assimilation of cod and nh4 by microalgal cells thus resulting in an elevated microalgal growth and nutrients recycling from ll for the mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 during the cultivation of microalgae with stress conditions more eps will be generated to protect cells from environment and to promote their growth xie et al 2020 as seen in fig 4a the maximum eps concentration of 78 29 mg g mlvss was obtained under the so cv of 1 1 and contained 50 11 mg g mlvss tb eps and 28 18 mg g mlvss lb eps in general the total eps contents in the mixed microalgae group about 70 mg g mlvss were obviously higher than those of the pure microalgae group about 50 mg g mlvss indicating that the mixed microalgae can trigger more eps secretion than the pure microalgae since surface charge of microalgae is mainly affected by the content of eps higher eps content for the so cv of 1 1 caused a more negative zeta potential of 25 2 mv in which tb eps and lb eps contributed equally table 2 in addition because zeta potential is an important index to reflect the settling capability and the stability of homogeneous solution yousefi et al 2020 the more negative zeta potential in the so cv of 1 1 may represent a more stable environment than other groups this may provide a better condition for the growth of microalgae resulting in an improved microalgal biomass of 1 29 g l fig 3a meanwhile the adsorption rate of positively charged inorganics such as nh4 towards the negatively charged eps can also be accelerated for the so cv of 1 1 which not only enhanced the removal of nh4 to 47 16 but also provided more nitrogen for microalgae cells fig 3d to further reveal the synergistic mechanisms between so and cv the compositions of tb eps and lb eps as well as their chemical bonds in the mixed microalgae groups were compared with those of the pure microalgae groups as seen in fig 4b l and table 3 fluorescence intensity peak around ex em of 370 370 9 nm at zone iv fig 4c l represented tyrosine and tryptophan family proteins which are reported to participate in the adsorption of organics and nh4 due to abundant functional groups and chemical bonds chen et al 2003 as seen in fig 4 and table 3 the fluorescence intensity of tyrosine and tryptophan family proteins for lb eps 25 225 1 a u and tb eps 25 798 9 a u for the so cv of 1 1 were higher than those for the pure microalgae groups indicating that the mixed microalgae of so cv 1 1 had higher concentrations of tyrosine and tryptophan family proteins however the ft ir spectra illustrate that the intensities of coc bond wavelength of 1085 cm 1 c o bond 1616 cm 1 nh bond 1637 cm 1 and oh bond 3413 cm 1 on the eps of so cv 1 1 group were much lower than those for the pure microalgae groups fig 4b these chemical bonds coc c o nh and oh bonds usually have negative charge and may accelerate the adsorption of nh4 towards microalgal eps through electrostatic attraction tang et al 2021 the higher tyrosine tryptophan family proteins and lower strengths of chemical bonds for the so cv of 1 1 group indicated that more nh4 was adsorbed onto the eps and occupied the active sites from this viewpoint it may be inferred that dual microalgae of cv and so exhibited synergistic effects for the adsorption of nh4 onto the microalgae eps thus improving the availability of nitrogen and facilitating the uptake of microalgae over pure microalgae groups besides most chemical bonds in the eps proteins and polysaccharides were nonpolar which have high affinity to polar organics in ll meanwhile high hydrophobicity of eps proteins and polysaccharides can promote cell to cell aggregation and improve the hydrophobic force of microalgae thus enhancing the cod adsorption by eps jia et al 2017 wu et al 2022 therefore the lower chemical bond intensities for the so cv of 1 1 could be ascribed to higher adsorption of cod and nh4 by eps which occupied the chemical sites and reduced the bond intensities it can be inferred that higher eps content with richer tyrosine tryptophan like proteins in the mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 may have played a crucial role in the enhancements of cod and nh4 adsorptions as well as the microalgae growth 3 3 synergistic effects of dual microalgal interaction on energy conversion 3 3 1 energy conversion from ll to microalgal biomass microalgae biomass is a potential feedstock for producing biohydrogen and vfas through df which is attributed to easy depolymerization carbohydrates proteins and lipids are the three major compositions of microalgal biomass in which lipids can hardly be used by hpb feng et al 2022 therefore high contents of carbohydrates and proteins in microalgae cells are of great importance for the df process the intracellular compositions in mixed microalgae with various so cv ratios are shown in fig 5a the results showed that proteins 29 9 37 16 were the leading component of the microalgal biomass followed by carbohydrates 22 79 33 89 and lipids 14 71 17 64 the maximum volumetric energy yield of 26 84 kj l was achieved for the so cv of 1 1 which consisted of 11 46 kj l from proteins 7 82 kj l from lipids and 7 56 kj l from carbohydrates as seen in fig 5a the contents of microalgal intracellular proteins carbohydrates and lipids in the mixed microalgae so cv of 1 1 1 2 or 2 1 were generally higher than those in the pure microalgae so cv of 1 0 or 0 1 this could be due to the reason that more eps secreted ca 70 mg g mlvss for the mixed microalgae groups than the pure microalgae groups fig 4a which wrapped on the microalgae cells and provided more favorable environment for cellular metabolism by the insulating pollutants as a result the maximum contents of proteins and carbohydrates of 37 16 and 33 89 were obtained for mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 since the volumetric energy yield of microalgae is closely related to the concentration of biomass and the composition of intracellular macromolecules the maximum total energy yield of 26 86 kj l was obtained for the mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 which was attributed to higher biomass concentration 1 29 g l and higher contents of intracellular proteins carbohydrates and lipids this would offer a great possibility to produce more biohydrogen and vfas 3 3 2 energy conversion from microalgal biomass to biohydrogen and vfas biohydrogen is a renewable and environment friendly energy resource with high heating value moreover vfas are valuable platform molecules that can be converted to medium chain carboxylic acids and various value added bioproducts such as biomethane and polyhydroxyalkanoates deng et al 2022 however when ll was directly used for df in our pre experiments no hydrogen or vfa generation was observed in the system in contrast hydrogen yield hy hydrogen production rate hpr and vfas yields were greatly improved by linking microalgal photosynthesis and df with microalgae biomass used as the feedstock fig 5b h the highest hy of 32 84 ml g vs and hpr of 4 87 ml g vs h were obtained for the so cv of 1 1 under which condition the concentrations of major vfas involving acetic acid 383 30 mg l butyric acid 577 24 mg l and valeric acid 45 18 mg l were also higher than other groups which was attributed to more abundant carbohydrates and proteins the possible conversion pathways of microalgal biomass during df process are depicted in fig 5i since lipids are hard to be used by hpb the microalgal intracellular carbohydrates and proteins are deemed as the major feedstocks for the df process feng et al 2022 when hydrolyzed carbohydrates were used as the feedstocks biohydrogen and vfas were mainly produced via the reaction pathways shown in eqs 11 15 sun et al 2020 11 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 c h 3 c h 2 o h 2 c o 2 12 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o o h 2 c o 2 4 h 2 13 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 h 2 2 c h 3 c h 2 c o o h 2 h

product without the production or consumption of biohydrogen during this process reaction eqs 12 and 14 are biohydrogen production processes with the byproducts of acetic acid and butyric acid whereas reaction eqs 13 and 15 are the biohydrogen consumption processes with the byproducts of propionic acid and valeric acid in this work acetic acid and butyric acid concentrations around 200 600 mg l are one order of magnitude larger than propionic acid and valeric acid concentrations around 10 50 mg l fig 5e h this demonstrates that the production processes of biohydrogen reaction eqs 12 and 14 were much more active than the biohydrogen consumption processes reaction eqs 13 and 15 it is also observed that acetic acid and butyric acid concentrations for the so cv of 1 1 were higher than those for the pure microalgae so cv of 1 0 or 0 1 fig 5e and g however the concentration of ethanol for the so cv of 1 1 was lower than that for pure microalgae with the so cv of 0 1 fig 5d these results demonstrated that the mixed microalgae was beneficial for producing biohydrogen reaction eqs 12 and 14 than the pure microalgae while the activity of ethanol production in pure microalgae with the so cv of 0 1 was higher than the mixed microalgae therefore hy and hpr in mixed microalgae were much higher than those for pure microalgae so cv of 1 0 or 0 1 fig 5b c besides the fitting curves of biohydrogen yields with gompertz model illustrated that mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 had shorter adaption period than pure microalgae fig s3 the results further showed that the synergistic effect of dual microalgae had a significant positive impact on hy for the pure microalgae group apart from carbohydrates microalgal proteins can also be hydrolyzed and fermented through df to produce abundant vfas with only a small amount of biohydrogen in general proteins are hydrolyzed into fermentable amino acids with alanine c3h7o2n serine c3h7o3n aspartic acid c4h7o4n glutamic acid c5h9o4n leucine c6h13o2n and arginine c6h14o2n4 as representatives biohydrogen and vfas can be produced with the following possible reaction pathways as given by reaction eqs 16 24 when amino acids were used

can be produced during the fermentation of proteins which can resist solution acidification and therefore be beneficial for the microbial activity according to reaction eqs 16 24 abundant vfas were produced with only a small amount of biohydrogen generated in detail only fermentation processes of alanine reaction eq 16 serine reaction eq 18 aspartic acid reaction eq 20 and leucine reaction eq 23 can be used to produce biohydrogen besides among all the products of proteins fermentation the proportion of biohydrogen was very low for example in reaction eq 16 only 1 mol of biohydrogen was produced along with 3 mol of vfas since proteins are the most predominant components in microalgae the microalgal biomass preferentially produced vfas 3 4 energy analysis and environmental implications of the technology to evaluate the economic feasibility of the technology eces of various steps during the bioconversion of ll involving light bioreaction by microalgae cells dark bioreaction by hpb and overall process linking both the microalgae and hpb were calculated and the results are presented in fig 6 and table 4 the highest total energy yield of 10 80 kj l was obtained for the so cv of 1 1 with butyric acid 6 85 kj l acetic acid 1 82 kj l ethanol 1 12 kj l and biohydrogen 0 52 kj l as the major contributors as a result the maximum overall ece1 3 of 7 75 was achieved from ll to bioproducts biohydrogen and vfas for the so cv of 1 1 which was attributed to higher contents of fermentable proteins and carbohydrates during the conversion from ll to bioproducts ece1 2 for the cultivation of photosynthetic microalgae around 16 was much lower than ece2 3 for the df process around 40 demonstrating that light bio reaction was the major limiting step for the overall process fig 6b which can be ascribed to high toxicity of ll for microalgae cells moreover during the df process ece2 3 was generally lower than 40 in which non fermentable lipids contributed to a large proportion of energy loss since lipids occupied more than 30 energy in microalgal biomass table 4 as a result the highest ece1 3 for the overall process was 7 75 in the mixed microalgae for the so cv of 1 1 which exhibited sharp progress compared to that for the pure microalgae 2 92 for the so cv of 1 0 and 4 77 for 0 1 besides there are many extra environmental benefits for co2 fixation ll treatment and nutrients reclamation for producing bioenergy which can further enhance the competitiveness of the technology in summary this work provides a potential approach for efficient ll treatment and bioenergy production moreover the study provides an in depth analysis of the underlying synergistic mechanisms of dual microalgal interactions 4 conclusions this work demonstrates the feasibility of efficient reclamation of nutrients from ll to produce biohydrogen and vfas with an integrated technology by linking microalgal photosynthesis and df notably the effect of eps on synergy of mixed microalgal interactions was revealed during photosynthetic ll bioremediation obvious higher eps concentrations ca 70 mg g mlvss were observed in the mixed microalgae compared to that for the pure microalgae groups the eps played a crucial role in the assimilation of microalgal cod and nh4 by forming more negative zeta potential and secreting more tyrosine tryptophan family proteins in the eps which accelerated the transfer of cod and nh4 towards microalgal cells as a result 47 16 of nh4 and 32 42 cod were recovered from ll in the mixed microalgae for the so cv of 1 1 higher eps concentration for the so cv of 1 1 contributed to enhanced microalgal growth of 1 29 g l together with higher accumulation of intracellular compositions resulting in higher energy conversion into biohydrogen and vfas with the highest total energy yield of 10 80 kj l obtained for the so cv of 1 1 however this is not enough to compensate the total input energy for the whole process which should be given more attention to make the technique economically more feasible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15080,bioconversion of nutrients and energy from landfill leachate ll to biohydrogen and volatile fatty acids vfas using dark fermentation df is a promising technique for developing a sustainable ecosystem however poor performance of df caused by vulnerable fermentative bacteria vitality and strong ll toxicity significantly hinder its commercialization herein an integrated technique linking microalgae photosynthesis and df was proposed in which mixed microalgae were applied to robustly reclaim nutrients and chemical oxygen demand cod from ll then microalgae biomass was fermented into biohydrogen and vfas using the df process underlying synergistic mechanisms of the interaction of scenedesmus obliquus and chlorella vulgaris resulting from the functioning of extracellular polymeric substances eps were discussed in detail for better absorption of nutrients from ll the mixed microalgae secreted obviously more eps than pure microalgae which played vital roles in the assimilation of cellular nutrients by forming more negative zeta potential and secreting more tyrosine tryptophan family proteins in eps besides mixed microalgae produced more intracellular proteins and carbohydrates than the pure microalgae thereby providing more feedstock for df and achieving higher energy yield of 10 80 kj l than 6 64 kj l that was obtained when pure microalgae were used moreover the energy conversion efficiency of 7 75 was higher for mixed microalgae than 4 77 that was obtained for pure microalgae this work may inspire efficient disposal of ll and production of bioenergy together with filling the knowledge gaps of synergistic mechanisms of dual microalgal interactions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords landfill leachate dark fermentation microalgae extracellular polymeric substances biohydrogen data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the past few decades rapid urbanization has produced vast amounts of solid wastes much of these wastes are buried as landfills which unfortunately generates large quantities of landfill leachate ll lin et al 2021 direct discharge of ll can cause serious pollution of aquatic environment which is attributed to high concentrations of inorganics and toxic organics shadi et al 2022 mature ll usually contains more than 50 types of refractory organics and over 30 000 ppm inorganics bringing along the challenge of safe disposal of these waste materials wijekoon et al 2022 current methods to treat ll can mainly be divided into three categories of physical chemical and biological technologies and include adsorption using activated carbon membrane filtration advanced oxidation processes and bioremediation using activated sludge li et al 2019 shen et al 2021 however these technologies are suffering from technical bottlenecks such as high energy consumption risk of secondary pollution and poor treatment efficiency wu et al 2023 besides available approaches for disposing ll mainly focus on the removal of pollutants from water streams however little focus has been given to the reuse and recycle of energy and nutrients abundant valuable resources such as nitrogen phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand cod contained in ll are wasted paiva et al 2021 as is well known energy shortage is another key issue facing humanity therefore exploring renewable and eco friendly energy alternatives to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and achieve carbon neutrality is of great significance jia et al 2020 hydrogen is an ideal alternative fuel due to its inherent advantages of high energy density and clean combustion products h2o converting hidden energy and resources from ll to biohydrogen using dark fermentation df can simultaneously achieve safe disposal of ll while producing energy with added advantages of producing volatile fatty acids vfas during the process which are platform molecules for producing biochemicals and biofuels such as polyhydroxyalkanoate and biomethane slezak et al 2017 however the production of biohydrogen and vfas using ll as the df medium still faces great challenges including low energy conversion efficiency ece and poor economic feasibility pastor et al 2013 reported that the production rate of only 0 16 ml h2 g vs day was achieved with less than 40 removal of the volatile solids using oils and landfill leachates as the df substrate resulting in a poor maximum h2 yield of about 15 3 ml h2 g vs which is ascribed to the vulnerable activity of hydrogen producing bacteria hpb due to the strong toxicity of ll originating from abundant refractory organics and inorganics cao et al 2022 instead of hpb photosynthetic microalgae are potential alternatives for recovering nutrients and energy form ll due to their strong immunity li et al 2022 microalgae can reclaim organics nitrogen and phosphorus from ll and convert them into intracellular carbohydrates and proteins used as ideal df feedstock for producing biohydrogen zhang et al 2021 therefore the cooperation of microalgae and hpb by linking light and dark bio reactions is a promising approach for efficient bioremediation of ll and production of bioenergy feng et al 2022 during the process intrinsic properties of microalgae strains play a crucial role in the disposal of ll and the conversion of bioenergy ahmed et al 2022 on the one hand cellular tolerance to environmental stress and nutrients recovery obviously varies with microalgae species due to different physiological responses which lead to distinct ll treatment performance khanzada and Ã¶vez 2017 on the other hand microalgae cellular metabolism can change sharply due to strains which may provide different compositions of feedstock for df thus resulting in distinct yields of products feng et al 2022 until now researchers have successfully realized microalgae based ll bioremediation achieving as high as 48 1 nitrogen recovery efficiency chang et al 2018 however the up to date approaches are mostly conducted using pure microalgae strains on laboratory scale which is different from using mixed microalgae strains in practical applications in practice microalgae usually appear as mixed strains in highly polluted environments which can provide robust growth profiles that are attributed to specific physiological responses among various species luo et al 2020 hu et al 2021 stated that the dual species microalgae system of chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus dimorphus had a considerably higher biomass density nutrients removal efficiency as well as the production of carbohydrates and proteins than the mono species microalgae system during ll treatment however the unclear mechanisms about the interactions of mixed microalgae species and their impact on the adsorption of nutrients and accumulation of biomass in particularly the important role of eps in the adsorption of nutrients have limited our understanding and optimization of ll bioremediation using microalgae in short how the different compositions of mixed microalgae species impact the downstream df processes for producing bioenergy are also unclear these gaps in knowledge significantly hinder the large scale application of microalgae based ll treatment and bioenergy production processes in this work photosynthesis of microalgae and df were serially linked for efficient treatment of ll and conversion of bioenergy fig 1 the mixed microalgae species of c vulgaris cv and scenedesmus obliquus so were used to reclaim nutrients and energy from ll and relied on the robust activity of microalgae under stress environment the underlying synergistic effects of dual microalgal interactions were studied in detail using three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy 3d eem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir the metabolism of the mixed microalgae and its influence on the df process were revealed moreover the energy conversion pathways for ll s conversion to biohydrogen and vfas were comprehensively studied in particular the roles of eps in the adsorption of nutrients and growth of microalgae were emphasized in the mixed microalgae system the goals of this study include 1 achieving efficient ll bioremediation and bioenergy production by linking microalgae photosynthesis with df 2 analyzing underlying synergistic mechanisms of dual microalgae interactions and their impact on ll treatment and bioenergy production 3 evaluating the ece from ll to bioproducts biohydrogen and vfas by linking light and dark bio reactions 2 materials and methods

ll belonged to mature ll detailed parameters about the ll are presented in table 1 2 2 microalgae strains and activated sludge microalgae strains of c vulgaris cv and s obliquus so were purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences in wuhan china both the cv and so were selected due to their superior growth characteristics as well as high contents of protein and carbohydrate the strains were pre cultivated in bg 11 medium according to the method detailed in a previous study chang et al 2022 activated sludge granules containing hpb were purchased from li bo yuan environmental materials co ltd shandong china 2 3 bioremediation of landfill leachate using dual microalgae cultivation ll bioremediation with dual microalgae strains was carried out in 500 ml glass flasks prior to this the suspended solids in the original ll were removed using centrifugation tg16 ws hunan xiangyi laboratory instrument development china initially 67 5 ml of the original ll was mixed in 382 5 ml deionized water to obtain a 15 diluted ll v v total inoculation density of microalgae was controlled at 0 1 g l for all the groups with the so cv concentration ratios of 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 and 2 1 respectively no domestications on microalgae species were conducted before the bioremediation of ll experiments all groups were sterilized at 121 c for 20 min using an autoclave bxm

performed in triplicates 2 4 dark fermentation the dark fermentation was conducted according to the method given by feng et al 2022 as shown in fig s1 supplementary information si during the process microalgae biomass collected from ll medium was dissolved into 100 ml deionized water and pretreated in an autoclave with 1 h2so4 to break the cell wall of microalgae subsequently 125 ml deionized water and 5 g anaerobic activated sludge granules were injected into the glass fermenter for df with the initial ph of 6 0 0 1 all bottles were carefully sealed with bottle caps and purged with n2 for 10 min to form anaerobic environment these bottles were placed into the thermostatic water bath at 35 0 1 c to produce biohydrogen and vfas 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 macromolecular organics in ll

microalgae lb eps and tb eps were measured using a zeta analyzer zetasizer nano zs nano particle size potentiometer malvern instruments ltd uk compositions of eps were determined using a 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy lumina thermo fisher usa before the analysis all samples were filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m microporous membrane to remove suspended solids chemical bonds of eps extracted from

total output energy w3 in kj during df is calculated using eq 10 10 w 3 k j e v o l u m e t r i c v 2 ece of conversion process from ll to microalgal biomass was named as ece1 2 and equaled to w2 w1 additionally ece from microalgal biomass to biohydrogen and vfas during df was named as ece2 3 which equaled to w3 w2 moreover ece of the whole process from ll to bioproducts biohydrogen and vfas integrating microalgal photosynthesis and df steps was named as ece1 3 and equaled to w3 w1 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of ll the composition of the original ll is presented in table 1 which indicated that high concentrations of cod 4997 78 49 80 mg l and nh4 1549 49 40 43 mg l and high chromaticity 1150 100 pt co were observed in the ll this could cause severe toxicity on hpb especially for the extortionate nondegradable macromolecular organics as seen in fig 2 more than 14 types of macromolecular organics were detected with phenol 2587 68 mg l docosenamide 821 59 mg l and hydroxyphenylpropionic acid 500 21 mg l as the three major components these macromolecular organics especially the phenol may cause strong inhibitory effects on the activity of hpb for generating biohydrogen cao et al 2022 beside the macromolecular organics high nh4 concentration is another inhibitor to the activity of hpb which can not only damage c n balance of the feedstock but can also cause n poisoning for hpb which is attributed to nitrogen luxury uptake by hpb cells chang et al 2020 therefore it can be inferred that the ll was adverse in nature for producing biohydrogen and vfas using df process 3 2 synergistic effects of dual microalgal interactions on the accumulation of biomass and bioremediation of ll 3 2 1 performances of mixed microalgae growth and ll treatment considering the difficulty of ll disposal by dark fermentative hpb the photosynthetic microalgae with high robustness were first applied to recover nutrients and energy from ll the performances of biomass growth chlorophyll synthesis cod and nutrients removal by mixed microalgae under various so cv ratios are shown in figs 3 and s1 the results showed that the mixed microalgae had higher growth profile over pure so or cv groups i e so cv 1 0 or 0 1 the highest biomass concentration of 1 29 g l was achieved for the mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 indicating improvements of 29 00 and 20 56 compared to pure cv so cv 0 1 and pure so so cv 1 0 respectively fig 3a besides the maximum chlorophyll concentration of 94 07 mg l was also obtained under the so cv of 1 1 which was ca 40 higher than that obtained using the pure microalgae fig 3b these results demonstrated that some underlying synergistic effects between the so and cv existed in the mixed microalgae system with the so cv of 1 1 which triggered a more active photosynthesis than the pure microalgae groups during the bioremediation of ll chemical oxygen demand cod and the removal of nh4 in different groups are shown in fig 3c d the results showed that the highest cod and nh4 removals were obtained under the so cv of 1 1 with the values of 227 90 mg l and 104 13 mg l respectively the cod removals in cv and so were only 84 28 and 132 27 mg l which were 50 less than that for the so cv of 1 1 besides the removal of nh4 for pure microalgae was also much less than that for the mixed microalgae with the value of 78 34 mg l nh4 removal for the so cv of 0 1 and 90 24 mg l for the so cv of 1 0 as a result the maximum removal efficiencies of 32 42 and 47 16 were obtained for cod and nh4 in the so cv of 1 1 table s1 suggesting that the vigorous growth profiles of mixed microalgae for the so cv of 1 1 endowed microalgal cells with the capability to assimilate more cod and nh4 during ll treatment however the underlying mechanisms of synergistic effects between microalgal so and cv are unclear it is noteworthy that no3 and po4 3 concentrations in all the groups were completely depleted after day 1 fig s2 which may be attributed to low initial concentrations 3 2 2 insights into the effect of eps on the dual microalgal interaction to reveal the synergistic mechanisms of dual microalgal interactions between so and cv the microalgal eps concentration surface zeta potential eps composition and chemical bonds intensity are illustrated in fig 4 and tables 2 3 the results showed that the mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 had higher eps content higher contents of tyrosine tryptophan family proteins and more negative zeta potential than the pure microalgae with the so cv of 1 0 or 0 1 meanwhile the mixed microalgae had much lower chemical bonds intensity of eps than the pure microalgae it can be hypothesized that the eps may have played a vital role in the adsorption of cod and nh4 which can trigger more active assimilation of cod and nh4 by microalgal cells thus resulting in an elevated microalgal growth and nutrients recycling from ll for the mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 during the cultivation of microalgae with stress conditions more eps will be generated to protect cells from environment and to promote their growth xie et al 2020 as seen in fig 4a the maximum eps concentration of 78 29 mg g mlvss was obtained under the so cv of 1 1 and contained 50 11 mg g mlvss tb eps and 28 18 mg g mlvss lb eps in general the total eps contents in the mixed microalgae group about 70 mg g mlvss were obviously higher than those of the pure microalgae group about 50 mg g mlvss indicating that the mixed microalgae can trigger more eps secretion than the pure microalgae since surface charge of microalgae is mainly affected by the content of eps higher eps content for the so cv of 1 1 caused a more negative zeta potential of 25 2 mv in which tb eps and lb eps contributed equally table 2 in addition because zeta potential is an important index to reflect the settling capability and the stability of homogeneous solution yousefi et al 2020 the more negative zeta potential in the so cv of 1 1 may represent a more stable environment than other groups this may provide a better condition for the growth of microalgae resulting in an improved microalgal biomass of 1 29 g l fig 3a meanwhile the adsorption rate of positively charged inorganics such as nh4 towards the negatively charged eps can also be accelerated for the so cv of 1 1 which not only enhanced the removal of nh4 to 47 16 but also provided more nitrogen for microalgae cells fig 3d to further reveal the synergistic mechanisms between so and cv the compositions of tb eps and lb eps as well as their chemical bonds in the mixed microalgae groups were compared with those of the pure microalgae groups as seen in fig 4b l and table 3 fluorescence intensity peak around ex em of 370 370 9 nm at zone iv fig 4c l represented tyrosine and tryptophan family proteins which are reported to participate in the adsorption of organics and nh4 due to abundant functional groups and chemical bonds chen et al 2003 as seen in fig 4 and table 3 the fluorescence intensity of tyrosine and tryptophan family proteins for lb eps 25 225 1 a u and tb eps 25 798 9 a u for the so cv of 1 1 were higher than those for the pure microalgae groups indicating that the mixed microalgae of so cv 1 1 had higher concentrations of tyrosine and tryptophan family proteins however the ft ir spectra illustrate that the intensities of coc bond wavelength of 1085 cm 1 c o bond 1616 cm 1 nh bond 1637 cm 1 and oh bond 3413 cm 1 on the eps of so cv 1 1 group were much lower than those for the pure microalgae groups fig 4b these chemical bonds coc c o nh and oh bonds usually have negative charge and may accelerate the adsorption of nh4 towards microalgal eps through electrostatic attraction tang et al 2021 the higher tyrosine tryptophan family proteins and lower strengths of chemical bonds for the so cv of 1 1 group indicated that more nh4 was adsorbed onto the eps and occupied the active sites from this viewpoint it may be inferred that dual microalgae of cv and so exhibited synergistic effects for the adsorption of nh4 onto the microalgae eps thus improving the availability of nitrogen and facilitating the uptake of microalgae over pure microalgae groups besides most chemical bonds in the eps proteins and polysaccharides were nonpolar which have high affinity to polar organics in ll meanwhile high hydrophobicity of eps proteins and polysaccharides can promote cell to cell aggregation and improve the hydrophobic force of microalgae thus enhancing the cod adsorption by eps jia et al 2017 wu et al 2022 therefore the lower chemical bond intensities for the so cv of 1 1 could be ascribed to higher adsorption of cod and nh4 by eps which occupied the chemical sites and reduced the bond intensities it can be inferred that higher eps content with richer tyrosine tryptophan like proteins in the mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 may have played a crucial role in the enhancements of cod and nh4 adsorptions as well as the microalgae growth 3 3 synergistic effects of dual microalgal interaction on energy conversion 3 3 1 energy conversion from ll to microalgal biomass microalgae biomass is a potential feedstock for producing biohydrogen and vfas through df which is attributed to easy depolymerization carbohydrates proteins and lipids are the three major compositions of microalgal biomass in which lipids can hardly be used by hpb feng et al 2022 therefore high contents of carbohydrates and proteins in microalgae cells are of great importance for the df process the intracellular compositions in mixed microalgae with various so cv ratios are shown in fig 5a the results showed that proteins 29 9 37 16 were the leading component of the microalgal biomass followed by carbohydrates 22 79 33 89 and lipids 14 71 17 64 the maximum volumetric energy yield of 26 84 kj l was achieved for the so cv of 1 1 which consisted of 11 46 kj l from proteins 7 82 kj l from lipids and 7 56 kj l from carbohydrates as seen in fig 5a the contents of microalgal intracellular proteins carbohydrates and lipids in the mixed microalgae so cv of 1 1 1 2 or 2 1 were generally higher than those in the pure microalgae so cv of 1 0 or 0 1 this could be due to the reason that more eps secreted ca 70 mg g mlvss for the mixed microalgae groups than the pure microalgae groups fig 4a which wrapped on the microalgae cells and provided more favorable environment for cellular metabolism by the insulating pollutants as a result the maximum contents of proteins and carbohydrates of 37 16 and 33 89 were obtained for mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 since the volumetric energy yield of microalgae is closely related to the concentration of biomass and the composition of intracellular macromolecules the maximum total energy yield of 26 86 kj l was obtained for the mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 which was attributed to higher biomass concentration 1 29 g l and higher contents of intracellular proteins carbohydrates and lipids this would offer a great possibility to produce more biohydrogen and vfas 3 3 2 energy conversion from microalgal biomass to biohydrogen and vfas biohydrogen is a renewable and environment friendly energy resource with high heating value moreover vfas are valuable platform molecules that can be converted to medium chain carboxylic acids and various value added bioproducts such as biomethane and polyhydroxyalkanoates deng et al 2022 however when ll was directly used for df in our pre experiments no hydrogen or vfa generation was observed in the system in contrast hydrogen yield hy hydrogen production rate hpr and vfas yields were greatly improved by linking microalgal photosynthesis and df with microalgae biomass used as the feedstock fig 5b h the highest hy of 32 84 ml g vs and hpr of 4 87 ml g vs h were obtained for the so cv of 1 1 under which condition the concentrations of major vfas involving acetic acid 383 30 mg l butyric acid 577 24 mg l and valeric acid 45 18 mg l were also higher than other groups which was attributed to more abundant carbohydrates and proteins the possible conversion pathways of microalgal biomass during df process are depicted in fig 5i since lipids are hard to be used by hpb the microalgal intracellular carbohydrates and proteins are deemed as the major feedstocks for the df process feng et al 2022 when hydrolyzed carbohydrates were used as the feedstocks biohydrogen and vfas were mainly produced via the reaction pathways shown in eqs 11 15 sun et al 2020 11 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 c h 3 c h 2 o h 2 c o 2 12 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o o h 2 c o 2 4 h 2 13 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 h 2 2 c h 3 c h 2 c o o h 2 h

product without the production or consumption of biohydrogen during this process reaction eqs 12 and 14 are biohydrogen production processes with the byproducts of acetic acid and butyric acid whereas reaction eqs 13 and 15 are the biohydrogen consumption processes with the byproducts of propionic acid and valeric acid in this work acetic acid and butyric acid concentrations around 200 600 mg l are one order of magnitude larger than propionic acid and valeric acid concentrations around 10 50 mg l fig 5e h this demonstrates that the production processes of biohydrogen reaction eqs 12 and 14 were much more active than the biohydrogen consumption processes reaction eqs 13 and 15 it is also observed that acetic acid and butyric acid concentrations for the so cv of 1 1 were higher than those for the pure microalgae so cv of 1 0 or 0 1 fig 5e and g however the concentration of ethanol for the so cv of 1 1 was lower than that for pure microalgae with the so cv of 0 1 fig 5d these results demonstrated that the mixed microalgae was beneficial for producing biohydrogen reaction eqs 12 and 14 than the pure microalgae while the activity of ethanol production in pure microalgae with the so cv of 0 1 was higher than the mixed microalgae therefore hy and hpr in mixed microalgae were much higher than those for pure microalgae so cv of 1 0 or 0 1 fig 5b c besides the fitting curves of biohydrogen yields with gompertz model illustrated that mixed microalgae with the so cv of 1 1 had shorter adaption period than pure microalgae fig s3 the results further showed that the synergistic effect of dual microalgae had a significant positive impact on hy for the pure microalgae group apart from carbohydrates microalgal proteins can also be hydrolyzed and fermented through df to produce abundant vfas with only a small amount of biohydrogen in general proteins are hydrolyzed into fermentable amino acids with alanine c3h7o2n serine c3h7o3n aspartic acid c4h7o4n glutamic acid c5h9o4n leucine c6h13o2n and arginine c6h14o2n4 as representatives biohydrogen and vfas can be produced with the following possible reaction pathways as given by reaction eqs 16 24 when amino acids were used

can be produced during the fermentation of proteins which can resist solution acidification and therefore be beneficial for the microbial activity according to reaction eqs 16 24 abundant vfas were produced with only a small amount of biohydrogen generated in detail only fermentation processes of alanine reaction eq 16 serine reaction eq 18 aspartic acid reaction eq 20 and leucine reaction eq 23 can be used to produce biohydrogen besides among all the products of proteins fermentation the proportion of biohydrogen was very low for example in reaction eq 16 only 1 mol of biohydrogen was produced along with 3 mol of vfas since proteins are the most predominant components in microalgae the microalgal biomass preferentially produced vfas 3 4 energy analysis and environmental implications of the technology to evaluate the economic feasibility of the technology eces of various steps during the bioconversion of ll involving light bioreaction by microalgae cells dark bioreaction by hpb and overall process linking both the microalgae and hpb were calculated and the results are presented in fig 6 and table 4 the highest total energy yield of 10 80 kj l was obtained for the so cv of 1 1 with butyric acid 6 85 kj l acetic acid 1 82 kj l ethanol 1 12 kj l and biohydrogen 0 52 kj l as the major contributors as a result the maximum overall ece1 3 of 7 75 was achieved from ll to bioproducts biohydrogen and vfas for the so cv of 1 1 which was attributed to higher contents of fermentable proteins and carbohydrates during the conversion from ll to bioproducts ece1 2 for the cultivation of photosynthetic microalgae around 16 was much lower than ece2 3 for the df process around 40 demonstrating that light bio reaction was the major limiting step for the overall process fig 6b which can be ascribed to high toxicity of ll for microalgae cells moreover during the df process ece2 3 was generally lower than 40 in which non fermentable lipids contributed to a large proportion of energy loss since lipids occupied more than 30 energy in microalgal biomass table 4 as a result the highest ece1 3 for the overall process was 7 75 in the mixed microalgae for the so cv of 1 1 which exhibited sharp progress compared to that for the pure microalgae 2 92 for the so cv of 1 0 and 4 77 for 0 1 besides there are many extra environmental benefits for co2 fixation ll treatment and nutrients reclamation for producing bioenergy which can further enhance the competitiveness of the technology in summary this work provides a potential approach for efficient ll treatment and bioenergy production moreover the study provides an in depth analysis of the underlying synergistic mechanisms of dual microalgal interactions 4 conclusions this work demonstrates the feasibility of efficient reclamation of nutrients from ll to produce biohydrogen and vfas with an integrated technology by linking microalgal photosynthesis and df notably the effect of eps on synergy of mixed microalgal interactions was revealed during photosynthetic ll bioremediation obvious higher eps concentrations ca 70 mg g mlvss were observed in the mixed microalgae compared to that for the pure microalgae groups the eps played a crucial role in the assimilation of microalgal cod and nh4 by forming more negative zeta potential and secreting more tyrosine tryptophan family proteins in the eps which accelerated the transfer of cod and nh4 towards microalgal cells as a result 47 16 of nh4 and 32 42 cod were recovered from ll in the mixed microalgae for the so cv of 1 1 higher eps concentration for the so cv of 1 1 contributed to enhanced microalgal growth of 1 29 g l together with higher accumulation of intracellular compositions resulting in higher energy conversion into biohydrogen and vfas with the highest total energy yield of 10 80 kj l obtained for the so cv of 1 1 however this is not enough to compensate the total input energy for the whole process which should be given more attention to make the technique economically more feasible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15081,riparian zones with their buffering ability and abundant water supply are often subjected to intensive agricultural activities we investigated a riparian aquifer located near a stream in south korea that recently experienced sharply decreasing groundwater levels and elevated nitrate no3 concentrations which were attributed to local agricultural activities our goal was to identify the predominant nitrogen sources and no3 removal processes multiple approaches including geochemical and isotopic tracers land use analysis metabolic gene quantification and inert gas tracers were used to elucidate groundwater and nutrient dynamics in stream side granitic aquifers the dual isotopic composition of no3 identified manure and sewage as the major sources of no3 contamination denitrification was the dominant no3 removal process in the aquifer as demonstrated by the negative relationship between Î´15n and Î´18o values in no3 and no3 cl denitrification and anammox genes were also observed in microbial communities of the aquifer throughout the study site suggesting that these processes support effective natural no3 attenuation in groundwater a mixing model constructed using a catchment scale dataset including sio2 concentrations and Î´18o h2o suggested that mixing with paddy soil water was the major driver of denitrification in the aquifer at the study site where impervious layers provided anaerobic conditions for natural no3 attenuation denitrification reduced the no3 flux into the nearby stream by up to 114 4 no3 kg ha y 26 kg n ha y the n2 generated by denitrification did not accumulate in the groundwater but mostly escaped from groundwater to the atmosphere as demonstrated by the degassed signature of dissolved inert gases below the air saturated water level this study identified the predominant no3 sources and conceptualized n cycling in the heavily developed agricultural riparian aquifer using multiple tracers demonstrating that no3 is partially removed through denitrification and possibly anammox while n2 mostly escapes into the atmosphere graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate riparian aquifer denitrification anammox natural attenuation noble gas data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface water bodies are often hydraulically connected to adjacent groundwater systems and are involved in the transfer of nutrients winter 1999 tian et al 2015 groundwater discharge can transport nutrients such as nitrate no3 into streams resulting in eutrophication walvoord and striegl 2007 river water can infiltrate and affect the water chemistry of nearby aquifers hosono et al 2013 buffer zones between groundwater and streams can physically filter contaminants and provide spaces and suitable biogeochemical conditions for a wide variety of microorganisms capable of naturally removing contaminants hiscock and grischek 2002 gu et al 2012 numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of riparian zones in rural areas and have highlighted the ability of stream side areas to attenuate no3 a nutrient and contaminant that is often of agricultural origin hill 1996 burt et al 1999 groffman and crawford 2003 the stable isotope composition of no3 is extensively used to deterministically identify nitrite sources in groundwater based on dual stable isotope mixing models using Î´15n and Î´18o in dissolved no3 aravena et al 1993 mayer et al 2002 liu et al 2006 wankel et al 2009 widory et al 2013 however nitrogen containing contaminants can be further altered by biogeochemical transformation processes which often result in variable isotope fractionation and concentration changes kendall 1998 nitrification often results in low Î´15n no3 values whereas no3 attenuation under anaerobic conditions simultaneously enriches 15n and 18o in the remaining fraction as no3 concentrations decrease fukada et al 2003 kendall et al 2007 trauth et al 2018 this bacterially mediated process such as denitrification and anammox converts reactive nitrogen species to n2 gas and its occurrence has been demonstrated by the abundance of specific biomarkers e g nitrous oxide reductase nosz and hydrazine oxidase hzo genes indicating the efficient natural attenuation of no3 in agricultural soils long et al 2013 incomplete denitrification of no3 can also result in the formation and accumulation of n2o which is a potent greenhouse gas deurer et al 2008 mcaleer et al 2017 natural no3 attenuation via microbial activity generates and accumulates n2 in groundwater to levels higher than the air equilibrium level vogel et al 1981 wilson et al 1990 popp et al 2020 by measuring excess n2 it is possible to estimate the amount of no3 originally present in groundwater heaton and vogel 1981 feast et al 1998 puckett and cowdery 2002 kennedy et al 2009 this approach has become more feasible with the development of portable mass spectrometers capable of measuring n2 o2 co2 and other dissolved inert gases in situ in the field brennwald et al 2016 on site measurements have recently been conducted to quantify the n2 produced from denitrification and have successfully revealed complex biogeochemical pathways in stream side groundwater popp et al 2020 n2 produced via microbial activity can only accumulate in groundwater under completely saturated flow conditions visser et al 2007 produced n2 can be degassed via decreased hydrostatic pressure in anaerobic conditions as demonstrated at agricultural study sites blicher mathiesen et al 1998 this n2 outgassing is often accompanied by depletion of noble gas tracers below the air equilibrium level gilmore et al 2016 stream side aquifers are an abundant water resource worldwide and intensive groundwater development is applied for agricultural purposes kuehn and mueller 2000 hiscock and grischek 2002 this reliable water resource has often a rather constant temperature and is frequently used for growing vegetables and other crops resulting in the intensive seasonal pumping of groundwater from riparian aquifers kwon et al 2017 the distribution of no3 in riparian aquifers can be complex because of the diverse no3 sources and volumetric mixing of various water masses including fresh local recharge from the soil surface infiltrating stream water and regional groundwater influx chen et al 2007 lasagna et al 2016 complex mixing of water masses often causes difficulties in understanding both groundwater and nutrient circulation unless a detailed understanding of the mixing system is obtained mahlknecht et al 2017 koh et al 2018 groundwater mixing is dependent on both aquifer hydraulic properties and the design of groundwater production wells e g screen depth and length and can be investigated by numerical simulation of groundwater solutes green et al 2014 the application of multiple environmental tracer techniques is an alternate approach to elucidate the characteristics of water samples and decipher the mixture of waters obtained from the production wells visser et al 2013 ju et al 2021b the noseongcheon aquifer is one of the best studied groundwater bodies in south korea and previous regional reconnaissance investigations in a 200 km2 catchment revealed the occurrence of nitrification denitrification dilution and evaporation affecting the n cycle koh et al 2010 kwon et al 2020 2022 the current study focused on a heavily agriculturally developed riparian zone of 10 km2 with the objective to elucidate the origin and fate of no3 in the riparian aquifer using multiple approaches including land use information dual isotope no3 compositions nitrogen cycle related metabolic gene analysis and inert gas tracer quantification the goal was to use this novel combination of methods to identify the mechanisms responsible for no3 attenuation within an aquifer discharging into a stream and to quantify the amount of no3 that is removed prior to discharge into surface waters this novel approach included the on site measurement of noble gas tracers to better understand n cycling processes in riparian aquifers subject to intensive seasonal pumping 2 study area the study site is located in the riparian zones of the noseongcheon stream a tributary of the geum river which is located in the mid western part of south korea fig 1 a the noseongcheon stream is 27 7 km long and its catchment area is 202 5 km2 kwon et al 2020 based on core observations from previous drilling of a national groundwater monitoring well ngmw the unweathered bedrock is located approximately 200 m below the ground surface bgs and gradually weathered towards the surface thus forming a regolith aquifer underneath the land surface 10 m thick alluvial deposits occur the aquifer in weathered jurassic granite produces groundwater predominantly from shallow depths 50 m whereas significant groundwater yields below 50 m bgs occur only near tectonic fractures cho et al 2003 therefore aquifer productivity relies predominantly on local groundwater recharge from nearby surface environments while groundwater contributions from distant recharge zones with longer flow paths are of minor importance koh et al 2010 land use in the noseongcheon stream catchment is classified into paddy fields 34 greenhouses 7 dry farmlands 17 residential areas 2 streams 1 forests and grasslands 27 and other types 12 fig 1c a considerable portion of the study area 58 is used for agricultural purposes where dry farmland is generally found in upland areas and rice paddies are located in lowland areas close to streams paddy fields hold 1 m water reservoirs above the surface that is open to the atmosphere and is subject to evaporation during the rice growing season greenhouses are located on alluvial deposits near streams water curtain cultivation systems are used to heat greenhouses during winter which requires a massive amount of groundwater kwon et al 2020 residential areas are generally located in hilly terrain with occasional small to medium sized livestock feedlots no3 contamination of groundwater has been reported at the study site since 2009 up to 83 5 mg l no3 95th percentile which was mainly attributed to local agricultural activities koh et al 2009 2010 kwon et al 2020 potential contaminant sources at the site include cultivation activities in dry farmlands residential areas and to a lesser extent in paddy fields ju et al 2018 kwon et al 2022 reported that n containing nutrients at the site were likely derived from fertilizers used in dry farmlands the average annual use of nitrogenous chemical fertilizers in the chungnam province was estimated to be 160 kg n ha in dry farmlands and paddy fields however nitrogenous fertilizer applications can be as high as 521 kg n ha yr if dry farmlands are dominant mafra 2020 when a national groundwater monitoring well ngmw fig 1c was installed in 2015 the groundwater level in the aquifer was initially 1 m asl since then the groundwater table has sharply decreased at a rate of 0 89 m y for the last five years i e a total of 4 5 m drawdown mainly due to intensive pumping for agricultural activities mostly from november to february figure s1 kwon et al 2022 moreover intensive agricultural activities such as extensive seasonal pumping of groundwater and diverse agricultural land uses strongly affect no3 dynamics in riparian aquifers kwon et al 2022 seasonally the stream recharges the nearby aquifer during the dry season january to march while base flow feeds the stream during the wet season july to mid november 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analysis a total of 18 groundwater samples were collected from domestic wells used for agriculture and households near the noseongcheon stream

including five springs f1 to f5 groundwater from four bedrock wells with depths of 80 150 m bgl b26 b28 b37 b38 and groundwaters from 55 shallow wells with depths 50 m bgl the others koh et al 2010 fig 1b these regional samples were collected between december 2007 and march 2008 from various land use areas such as paddy fields dry farmland residential areas and natural areas throughout the regional catchment the main land use for each site was reported by koh et al 2010 geochemical data such as Î´18o h2o and sio2 aq concentrations were used for statistical analysis in this study 3 2 land use analysis land use and land cover lulc data for the study area were obtained from the korean ministry of environment 2017 where raw data from the korean multi purpose satellite 2 can be

influence roi to determine entities potentially responsible for no3 contamination or n loading koh et al 2010 ju et al 2018 arcgis pro 2 8 0 software was used to perform spatial analysis of no3

determined using two different approaches first a high correlation between Î´15n or Î´18o values in no3 and no3 cl was assumed to imply a singular no3 origin li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 which enables the reconstruction of the initial chemical and isotopic composition of the no3 source the initial no3 concentration in groundwater no3 0 a can be defined as 7 n o 3 0 a c l n o 3 i c l i where cl is the measured concentration and no3 i cl i is the initial ratio in the no3 source before biogeochemical transformation the groundwater sample from n02 had the highest no3 concentration of 93 1 mg l fig 2 a which was used for the initial no3 i cl i ratio the second approach to determine the initial no3 0 b concentration was based on the measured no3 and n2 concentrations remaining in groundwater this approach assumed that the n2 mass generated from no3 attenuation accumulated in the aquifer without loss it was also assumed that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra was not prevalent in the riparian aquifer because the samples collected from the riparian aquifer contained narg nirs nosz and hzo genes while no nrfa was detected we also assumed that no3 was completely denitrified to n2 with no reduction of no3 to nh4 and no fractionation of excess air bÃ¶hlke et al 2002 kennedy et al 2009 8 n 2 den n 2 tot n 2 asw n 2 air 9 n 2 air n 2 40 ar air 40 ar tot 40 ar asw

hydrogeochemical parameters related to no3 contamination the measured hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater obtained from the riparian aquifer are summarized in table 1 no3 concentrations ranged from below the detection limit 0 03 mg l to 93 1 mg l with 3 of 18 samples exceeding the korean and world health organization who drinking water standards of 44 3 mg l equivalent to 10 mg l no3 n two additional samples exceeded the no3 contamination threshold 8 mg l set for south korean groundwater kim et al 2015 fig 2a the distribution of the no3 concentrations was tested for normality using the shapiro wilk test p 0 001 which was rejected at the 0 01 significance level thus the no3 concentration distribution did not follow a log normal distribution in the no3 concentration histogram fig 2a the distribution was highly skewed skewness 2 8 and had multiple peaks this result implies that no3 dynamics in the riparian aquifer are affected by multiple sources and processes otherwise a normal or log normal distribution would have been observed preziosi et al 2010 kim et al 2015 although small amounts of no3 and cl are introduced via atmospheric deposition most no3 and cl originates from contaminant sources in rural areas liu et al 2006 torres martÃ­nez et al 2020 the cl concentration in the groundwater samples ranged from 17 2 to 75 1 mg l in the riparian zone fig 2b the cl concentration distribution was log normal according to the shapiro wilk test p 0 2 suggesting a relatively simple distribution dominated by a single source or process kim et al 2015 although the distribution was skewed skewness 2 3 a cumulative relative frequency plot for the entire cl dataset displayed a smooth curve with a peak occurring at 23 4 mg l cl fig 2b cl can originate from precipitation 3 mg l domestic wastewater 57 mg l and agricultural contaminants 20 mg l at the sampling site koh et al 2010 suggesting that the collected stream side groundwater samples experienced significant contamination from anthropogenic sources groundwater from n02 was characterized by the highest cl concentration 75 1 mg l and a no3 cl molar ratio of 0 71 indicating that this sample was considerably impacted by a sewage source xia et al 2017 in fig 2 the no3 and cl concentrations of stream side groundwater samples blue colour are plotted together with those of samples collected throughout the catchment koh et al 2010 the 18 samples collected in this study displayed distinct distributions the cl concentrations were generally high fig 2b and the cl distribution was characterized by a single peak suggesting the dominance of a single source whereas the no3 distribution had multiple peaks in contrast to the conservative ion cl no3 is reactive and can be consumed by biogeochemical processes particularly under anaerobic conditions ding et al 2014 samples with no3 concentrations below 8 mg l were characterized by dissolved oxygen do 2 mg l except for sample n13 do 3 4 mg l table 1 considering the hydrogeological conditions of the site the low no3 concentrations were likely affected by multiple sources see section 4 3 and at least two processes 1 dilution with infiltrating stream water and 2 bacterially mediated attenuation processes described below 4 2 groundwater recharge sources and residence time stable h2o isotopes can be used to identify the origin and physical and geochemical interactions of groundwater lee et al 1999 comparing Î´18o h2o to Î´d h2o revealed that the groundwater samples from this study plot on the local meteoric water line lmwl characteristic for the rainy season indicating that the groundwater is predominantly recharged locally during the rainy season fig 3 a stream water blue square had an average Î´18o h2o value of 6 8 and an average Î´d h2o value of 48 0 kwon et al 2020 while groundwater samples black circles displayed Î´18o h2o values from 7 7 to 5 7 and Î´d h2o values from 50 6 to 38 6 given the absence of hydrothermal water rock interactions in the study area the stable isotope composition of groundwater is a function of precipitation input which is controlled by latitude continental and altitude effects that are potentially modified by evaporation lee et al 1999 groundwater obtained from sites n01 n02 and n09 which are located at the highest altitude in the study area had the lowest Î´18o h2o and Î´d h2o values consistent with recharge at higher altitudes table 1 the groundwater obtained from these wells had the highest no3 concentrations in the study area fig 2a implying that at least some groundwater was derived from local recharge and was affected by anthropogenic no3 sources near the wells rather than from longer groundwater flow paths linear regression analysis of the Î´18o h2o and Î´d h2o values of groundwater showed a slope of 5 9 which is significantly lower than the slope of 7 9 for the rainy season lmwl this result indicates that groundwater is affected by evaporation during recharge fig 3a lee et al 1999 at the study site a considerable portion of irrigation water is supplied from nearby reservoirs and streams through ditch networks and is impounded in paddy fields from may to september koh et al 2010 evaporation of impounded water enriches 18o and 2h in the remaining water which infiltrates the aquifer and elevates the Î´18o h2o and Î´d h2o values koh et al 2010 groundwater samples plotting on the evaporation line in fig 3a were obtained from wells n03 n04 n05 n06 n07 n11 and n18 which were located in the vicinity of paddy fields fig 1c 3h concentrations in the riparian aquifer ranged from 1 2 to 3 9 tu table 1 with most of the samples having 3h contents 2 tu except for groundwater from n11 n13 and n14 fig 3b elevated 3h contents were observed in groundwater near the stream side zones figure s5 implying that groundwater in these areas is mixed with infiltrating surface water that has a higher 3h content compared to other groundwater or is affected by intensive recent local recharge from the surface in the granitic aquifer silicate weathering buffers acidity from agricultural activity kwon et al 2020 as demonstrated by comparing hco3 and sio2 aq concentrations figure s6 all samples plotted below a 10 1 slope implying that the dissolution of silicate minerals plays a more important role in affecting groundwater chemistry than dissolution of carbonate minerals batsaikhan et al 2018 hounslow 2018 sio2 aq concentrations were negatively correlated with 3h content when 3h 2 tu young water fig 3b while samples with 3h 2 0 tu were not correlated with sio2 aq concentrations at the sampling sites young groundwater originates from recent recharge and is characterized by 3h contents ranging from 2 to 6 tu while groundwater with 3h contents between 0 5 and 2 tu represents mixtures of 3h free old water and young groundwater jung et al 2019 in the study area shallow groundwater is enriched in sio2 aq because of accelerated granite weathering caused by acidity from agricultural activities whereas deeper groundwater has lower sio2 aq concentrations kwon et al 2020 therefore the older groundwater obtained from wells n11 n13 and n14 had moderate sio2 aq concentrations and displayed different trends in sio2 aq concentration and 3h content various groundwater flow paths converge near the stream in the riparian zone and induce the mixing of groundwater of different ages and chemical signatures karan et al 2013 moreover the fractured granitic bedrock aquifer in the study area may provide preferential paths for older groundwater depleted in sio2 aq to migrate toward the shallow riparian aquifer the riparian aquifer at the study site belongs to the nonsan gyeryong watershed and is exposed to three different recharge pathways regional recharge paddy soil water and stream water infiltration kwon et al 2020 the groundwater of the watershed was monitored for basic geochemical water quality parameters by the korean government koh et al 2010 and the results are summarized in table s2 the regional groundwater had elevated sio2 concentrations 44 3 5 1 mg l resulting from granite weathering while the stream water and paddy field water had much lower sio2 concentrations 10 4 3 1 mg l and 14 3 2 2 mg l respectively notably the paddy soil water was characterized by elevated Î´18o h2o 5 1 0 1 due to evaporation of water in the paddy fields a bayesian mixing model was developed to identify the recharge water sources for the riparian aquifer and the catchment scale dataset was used to identify the endmember compositions figure s4 groundwater samples were found to be mixtures of three recharge sources with variable contributions from regional groundwater 16 82 stream water 7 49 and paddy soil water 6 55 depending on the location of the sampling well samples n05 and n06 had high sio2 concentrations caused by acidity from heavy application of fertilizers kwon et al 2020 figure s7 4 3 apportionment of agricultural no3 sources in groundwater dual stable no3 isotopes can be used to identify various no3 sources and reveal biogeochemical transformation processes affecting groundwater bÃ¶ttcher et al 1990 aravena et al 1993 wassenaar 1995 in fig 4 the Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 values of the groundwater samples are plotted in a dual isotope diagram designed to identify no3 sources based on the typical ranges from source data reported in previous studies xue et al 2009 no3 containing groundwater samples from the study site exhibited a wide range of Î´15n no3 values from 8 2 to 28 0 and Î´18o no3 values varied from 2 8 to 23 0 predominantly plotting in the manure and sewage zone fig 4 groundwater samples obtained from n04 n05 n13 n17 and n18 plotted outside the source boundary and had elevated Î´18o no3 values fig 4 the isotopic composition of nitrogen containing compounds in soils and groundwater is affected by biogeochemical transformation processes such as nitrification and denitrification kendall 1998 during nitrification three new oxygen atoms are introduced into newly formed no3 the expected Î´18o no3 values can be calculated in a deterministic way with one oxygen atom coming from atmospheric o2 with a Î´18o value of 23 5 kroopnick and craig 1972 amberger and schmidt 1987 aravena and mayer 2009 and two oxygens derived from ambient h2o hence no3 from nitrification at the study site was expected to have Î´18o no3 values around 7 fig 4 reveals that some samples had Î´18o no3 values close to the expected range whereas several other samples had Î´18o no3 values 10 these groundwater samples were characterized by low do concentrations 2 mg l fig 4 during denitrification 14n and 16o in no3 are preferentially consumed resulting in increasing Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 values in the remaining fraction as no3 concentration progressively decreases bÃ¶ttcher et al 1990 kendall et al 2007 under low do concentrations 1 2 mg l pina ochoa and Ã¡lvarez cobelas 2006 hocaoglu et al 2011 to further assess the significance of no3 attenuation in the riparian aquifer the relationships between no3 concentration and Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 values were evaluated bÃ¶ttcher et al 1990 the conservative tracer cl was incorporated to aid in evaluating the predominant biogeochemical processes mcmahon and bÃ¶hlke 2006 pastÃ©n zapata et al 2014 figure s8 reveals that the Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 values gradually increased as ln no3 cl decreased demonstrating natural no3 degradation compared to the conservative contaminant cl the ratio of the Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 was 1 0 which is consistent with the range of slopes reported for denitrification in previous studies 1 1 to 2 3 1 ju et al 2021a in fig 4 most of the samples with do 2 mg l were aligned with a no3 attenuation trajectory indicating that the groundwater no3 originated from a uniform source and was subsequently affected by a single biogeochemical no3 attenuation process namely denitrification the study area is located in the lower portions of a regional aquifer which is characterized by slow discharge rates kwon et al 2022 and likely results in do consumption hosono et al 2013 notably the low do levels for groundwater samples plotting along the 1 1 slope of Î´15n no3 vs Î´18o no3 fig 4 strongly support the occurrence of microbial no3 attenuation under anaerobic aquifer conditions e g via denitrification rather than dilution by infiltrating stream water otero et al 2009 li et al 2019 groundwater samples from n01 n02 and n09 were characterized by the lowest Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 values while having the highest no3 concentrations fig 4 together with the unique h2o isotopic signature i e relatively low Î´18o h2o and Î´d h2o values fig 3a this observation implies that these samples are characteristic of no3 source zones in the upland region of the riparian aquifer a source mixing model was designed for groundwater samples with do 3 mg l n01 n02 n03 and n09 the bmc mixing model produces probability density functions pdfs of the mixing fraction of the end members for the investigated samples from n01 n02 n03 and n09 assuming four potential sources including atmospheric deposition nh4 fertilizer soil n and manure sewage fig 5 the model revealed that manure and or sewage had the highest no3 contribution 71 to 77 in these groundwater samples followed by minor contributions from atmospheric deposition 5 to 12 no3 from soil n 6 to 11 and no3 derived from nitrification of nh4 fertilizers 4 to 9 table s3 groundwater sample n13 was characterized by aerobic conditions do 3 4 mg l and exhibited a different no3 source mixing structure manure and or sewage 59 atmospheric deposition 25 no3 from soil n 9 and no3 derived from nitrification of nh4 fertilizer 7 thus sample n13 was more affected by atmospheric deposition than other samples note that samples affected by microbial no3 attenuation were excluded from no3 source identification no3 contamination of groundwater is frequently associated with agricultural activities barringer et al 1990 eckhardt and stackelberg 1995 nolan 2001 potential no3 contamination source areas were categorized within 50 m distance to the respective sampling points koh et al 2010 ju et al 2018 figure s3 as explained in section 3 2 in linear regression analyses no3 was the dependent variable and the surface areas of the potential no3 sources such as dry farmland paddy fields greenhouses and residential areas were incorporated as explanatory variables the current no3 concentration in groundwater was significantly explained by the residence variable p 0 001 and r2 0 59 table s4 see model 1 3 the added entity dry farmland residential area showed improved performance in predicting the no3 concentration in groundwater with an improved r2 of 0 93 fig 6 suggesting that high proportions of dry farmland and residential area result in high no3 concentrations in groundwater all samples from the riparian aquifer had 3h 1 tu table 1 which implies that groundwater is mostly composed of recently recharged water from the surface koh et al 2005 in consequence the significant relationship between land use area and no3 concentration in groundwater indicates that the no3 distribution is controlled by surface activities above the permeable unconfined aquifer these observations are consistent with observations from previous studies in south korea kim et al 2008 ju et al 2018 and strongly indicate that the surface activities in both dry farmlands and residential areas are the key causes of no3 contamination of groundwater in rural areas of the study site and likely elsewhere in south korea 4 4 biogeochemical processes of no3 attenuation under reducing conditions to obtain novel insights into bacterial mediated no3 attenuation processes the relative abundance of the representative metabolic genes that encode the key denitrification enzymes was quantified through qpcr tomasek et al 2017 deng et al 2020 the distribution of the relative abundance of nitrogen cycle related metabolic genes to 16s rrna gene is shown in fig 7 compared to chemolithotrophic denitrification heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria utilizing organic matter gain more energy which makes them more prevalent in nature park and yoo 2009 di capua et al 2015 no3 attenuation related genes such as narg nirs and nosz were found throughout the samples collected from the riparian aquifer in the study area 14 of 18 samples reported the hydrazine oxidoreductase encoding gene hzo fig 7b d implying that anammox may be prevalent in the study site and may be associated with natural no3 attenuation in the riparian aquifer the occurrence of anammox bacteria can have significant implications for the natural attenuation of nitrogenous contaminant plumes in groundwater smits et al 2009 in a freshwater aquifer anammox contributed 39 90 of n2 production from reduced to oxidized conditions solely as an outcome of natural attenuation smith et al 2015 anammox can occur in contaminated groundwater under anoxic conditions when nitrogenous compounds are present moore et al 2011 although soils provide various favourable niches anammox bacteria are only detected under appropriate conditions such as oxic anoxic interfaces with sufficient concentrations of inorganic nitrogen compounds humbert et al 2010 interestingly the anammox related metabolic gene hzo was also detected in samples characterized by aerobic conditions with elevated do contents for example in sample n09 do 7 25 mg l corresponding to observations in smith et al 2015 fe2 and so4 2 concentrations up to 30 mg l and 142 mg l respectively were observed in the groundwater of the study site with the highest concentrations occurring in concert with the lowest no3 concentrations figure s9 the obligate chemolithotrophic bacterium thiobacillus denitrificans is able to couple the oxidation of various sulfur and reduced iron compounds such as pyrite cardoso et al 2006 with denitrification torrentÃ³ et al 2010 in previous field studies no3 reduction was often associated with pyrite oxidation pauwels et al 1998 juncher jÃ¸rgensen et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 2012 this may be the case also in some portions of this aquifer although further research would be required to confirm this previous studies at the study site reported that the microbial community in the stream side aquifer varied seasonally in dependence of the level of stream water groundwater interactions kwon et al 2020 the current study did not conduct any seasonal sampling and did not reveal significant correlations between the metabolic gene distribution and the distance of groundwater wells from the stream fig 7 this may be due to the complex reaction paths of nitrogenous compounds in and near the riparian zone harvey et al 2013 we have yet to determine the relative importance of anammox and denitrification contributing to no3 attenuation these processes can be evaluated and separated based on the innovative tracing approaches introduced by smith et al 2015 nevertheless the prevalence of narg nirs nosz and hzo throughout samples obtained from the study site implies that natural no3 attenuation is associated with bacterial mediated processes in the riparian aquifer 4 5 dissolved gases measured in situ and implications for n cycling groundwater samples generally have higher concentrations of gases derived from the air that exceed those in air saturated water asw or excess air which is typically due to dissolution of trapped air bubbles near the water table heaton and vogel 1981 the percentage of excess 40ar relative to asw was used as an indicator of the magnitude of excess air positive Î´40ar kennedy et al 2009 11 Î´ 40 ar 40 ar tot 40 ar asw 40 ar asw 100 where 40ar tot is the measured ar concentration in groundwater and 40ar asw is the calculated ar concentration at solubility equilibrium at the regional groundwater temperature bÃ¶hlke et al 2007 fig 8 a reveals that Î´40ar ranged up to 15 8 whereas slightly negative Î´40ar values were observed in groundwater obtained from n01 n02 and n07 these groundwater samples had gas concentrations lower than the asw level indicating that degassing occurred in the riparian aquifer gilmore et al 2016 this implies that no3 attenuation produced n2 was affected by substantial degassing resulting in a loss of dissolved gases from the aquifer groffman et al 2006 degassing is a plausible mechanism for the loss of dissolved gases in the riparian zone when the total partial pressure of dissolved gases exceeded the hydrostatic pressure blicher mathiesen et al 1998 dissolved n2 in groundwater can be used to identify the extent of biogeochemical no3 attenuation in polluted groundwater vogel et al 1981 we evaluated n2 accumulation from no3 attenuation in groundwater by reconstructing the initial contamination level no3 0 b using eqs 8 10 and no3 0 a estimated from eq 7 see section 3 4 for assessment of initial no3 concentrations no3 0 b was estimated from the measured no3 and n2 remaining in the groundwater while no3 0 a was based on the concentration of the conservative tracer cl the initial no3 concentrations were estimated using two different approaches no3 0 a and no3 0 b these concentrations are compared in fig 8c for most samples the calculated no3 0 a was higher than the no3 0 b calculated from the remaining gases this difference was up to 947 Âµm in sample n07 which implies that n2 produced from no3 attenuation does not accumulate in groundwater but is partially lost via outgassing from the aquifer note that the groundwater samples n01 03 and n09 were at the initial point in the no3 attenuation trend see fig 4 and had the lowest amount of generated n2 further these samples had the smallest difference between no3 0 and no3 which was less than 180 Âµm n01 in situ measured 40ar and 84kr concentrations were used to evaluate no3 attenuation in the local groundwater fig 9 the noble gas signatures indicated that the local groundwater was recharged in the temperature range of 5 20 c which is consistent with temperatures after the last glacial maximum seltzer et al 2021 ju et al 2022 these samples showed a typical excess air component of 0 005 cm3 stp g ju et al 2022 most of the samples from this study plotted below the air equilibrated line blue line in fig 9 suggesting that the groundwater was not contaminated by air inclusions samples that plotted below the typical asw boundary red dots indicate dissolved gas depletion or loss in this portion of the aquifer this phenomenon was previously observed in agricultural areas where stripping of biogenic gases such as n2 ch4 or co2 over dissolved gases often results in the depletion of low solubility noble gases below the asw level under anaerobic conditions zhou et al 2005 lightfoot et al 2022 for example visser et al 2007 observed noble gas concentrations below atmospheric equilibrium in 20 of 34 groundwater samples from agriculturally polluted sandy aquifers in the netherlands degassing is likely associated with anoxic biogeochemical processes that are accompanied by n2 production since most samples exhibited dissolved oxygen concentrations 2 mg l rivett et al 2008 fig 8b therefore the depletion of noble gases observed in groundwater samples n01 n03 n05 n07 and n08 implies that no3 attenuation accompanied with n2 production occurs in the aquifer while produced n2 escapes from the aquifer agricultural activities in paddy fields and water curtain cultivation activities at the study site require large amounts of water extraction from the aquifer a massive amount of water is pumped from production wells and used to maintain the elevated temperatures required to cultivate vegetables during the winter season irrigation is also required to maintain shallow water levels in paddy fields between late spring and autumn the intensive agricultural activities at the study site resulted in a markedly and progressively decreasing groundwater level which decreased at a rate of 0 89 m y figure s1 thereby inducing an instant pressure reduction in shallow depths during groundwater pumping operations this reduced pressure likely contributed to degassing in the shallow riparian aquifer in fig 8c the discrepancy between the initial no3 concentrations estimated using isotope data blue bar and the summation of remaining no3 and n2 green bar for several samples strongly suggests that no3 originating from anthropogenic activities was partially converted to n2 and then returned to the atmosphere due to outgassing from the aquifer overexploiting the groundwater depressurized the aquifer and released dissolved gases into the atmosphere which likely also released some n2o a potent greenhouse gas into the atmosphere although the types of accumulated gases in groundwater differ depending on the redox conditions of the systems mcaleer et al 2017 n2o produced by denitrification accumulates in groundwater with intermediate o2 concentrations at the transition from oxic to anoxic conditions deurer et al 2008 future extension of this study could investigate and quantify the sources and processes explaining the relative abundances of n2o and n2 in specific sections of the aquifer for example saggar et al 2013 revealed that factors such as soil n and carbon c contents ph temperature oxygen supply and water content can affect the n2o and n2 production ratios during denitrification such future measurements may reveal which factors control the denitrifier populations and enzyme activities and hence affect the relative production of n2o and n2 in the riparian aquifer reconstructed n2 no3 0 a no3 production is plotted against the mixing fractions of the three water sources regional groundwater stream water and paddy soil water as shown in fig 10 where each mixing fraction adds up to 1 the amount of estimated n2 was negatively correlated with groundwater contribution and was positively correlated with water contributions from paddy fields implying that the environment in paddy fields is favourable for the biogeochemical transformation of no3 to n2 via no3 attenuation the area of paddy field occurrence relates well to anaerobic conditions in groundwater for example samples from wells n04 n07 n11 and n18 which had the largest fractions of paddy soil water 35 55 displayed low do concentrations from 0 11 to 1 14 mg l in contrast the stream water contribution showed a negative or inconclusive relationship with the estimated n2 together with the unique no3 isotopic signatures fig 4 the samples associated with relatively high n2 concentrations imply that extensive no3 attenuation occurred in portions of the riparian aquifer at the study site thus infiltration of paddy soil water plays an important role in natural no3 attenuation in the riparian aquifer by enhancing anaerobic conditions that are favourable for microbes that facilitate no3 attenuation 4 6 effect of no3 attenuation on no3 flux into the stream elevated no3 in groundwater discharges to adjacent surface water through base flow which is a major contributor of no3 in agricultural catchments martin et al 2004 the no3 flux into the nearby stream was calculated for the catchment using eq 12 12 flux n o 3 base flow catchment area where the base flow in the study area with an area of 1018 ha was 5434 m3 d kwon et al 2022 the calculation resulted in a no3 flux to the stream ranging from 42 to 181 kg ha y 9 41 kg n ha y without no3 attenuation at the site table s5 following no3 attenuation the no3 concentrations in groundwater were markedly reduced and the no3 flux towards the stream decreased accordingly table s5 shows that the decreased no3 flux was up to 114 kg ha y 26 kg n ha y at n07 the sampling site with the largest contribution from paddy water to groundwater fig 10 this result confirmed that the no3 attenuation capacity of the riparian aquifer is highest in areas of recharge of anaerobic paddy soil water although the riparian aquifer was recharged by young water 3h 1 tu the aquifer displayed characteristic geochemical signatures that revealed natural remediation of anthropogenic no3 contamination in several parts of the aquifer as evidenced by no3 concentrations isotopic compositions of no3 and microbial markers natural attenuation of anthropogenic no3 contamination was facilitated by the recharge of anaerobic water from the overlying paddy fields no3 attenuation substantially reduced the no3 flux into the adjacent stream up to 26 kg n ha y and the produced n2 partially outgassed into the atmosphere as shown by the in situ measured noble gases 5 conclusions in riparian aquifers under intense agricultural activity variable contributions of paddy soil water infiltrating stream water shallow young groundwater and older regional groundwater result in complicated n delivery from surface environments to groundwater the high correlation between human impacted land use areas and no3 concentrations in groundwater suggests that nitrogenous contaminants predominantly originate from local agricultural activities and wastewater effluents at the investigated site source apportionment using the dual stable isotopic composition for samples unaffected by natural attenuation revealed that no3 in groundwater was mainly derived from manure and or sewage from cultivated land and residential areas the riparian aquifer received considerable recent recharge as indicated by elevated levels of 3h in groundwater due to infiltrating stream water and local recharge from the surface however low do concentrations were also prevalent implying a limited role for stream water mixing in the aquifer at several sites agricultural irrigation activities in paddy fields enhanced the local groundwater recharge carrying young anaerobic soil water into the aquifer thereby likely enhancing bacterially mediated natural attenuation of no3 contamination in contrast to observations that old groundwater facilitates anaerobic conditions for natural contaminant attenuation this study demonstrates that enhanced biogeochemical processes capable of no3 removal can occur as a result of local groundwater recharge originating from paddy fields the relationship between the n and o isotope ratios of no3 and no3 cl revealed significant no3 attenuation in the groundwater of the study site metabolic gene quantification clearly showed that denitrification was predominant in the aquifer with potential additional contributions from anammox indicating that bacterial mediated no3 attenuation was active in groundwater at the study site these processes decreased no3 concentrations in groundwater below the threshold value for anthropogenic contamination despite elevated nitrogen loading from agricultural and residential activities at the study site the in situ measured inert gases suggested that dissolved gases in the groundwater were equivalent to the air saturated level or degassed below this level the distribution of inert gases is affected by the stripping action of biogenic n2 produced via no3 attenuation processes despite efficient no3 attenuation in the groundwater of the study site n2 accumulation in groundwater was not significant the stream side aquifer has been subject to considerable groundwater withdrawal for local agricultural activities which significantly reduced the hydraulic pressure at shallow depths figure s1 resulting in degassing of low solubility gases bacterial no3 attenuation processes produce n2 gas that partially outgasses to the atmosphere this outgassing process also likely releases the potent greenhouse gas n2o into the atmosphere this suggests the need for future research to estimate the flux of individual greenhouse gases from groundwater to the atmosphere to understand the contributions of riparian aquifers with variable groundwater levels to anthropogenic global climate change this study provides novel information on the recharge processes and n dynamics in stream side granitic aquifers subject to intensive agricultural activities accompanied by considerable seasonal groundwater abstraction the integrated approach using geochemical and isotopic tracers land use analysis metabolic gene quantification and inert gas tracer measurements provides crucial insights into the biogeochemical processes of no3 attenuation in riparian aquifers and their impact on adjacent streams these new insights facilitate the implementation of an appropriate water management plan for watersheds with riparian zones under intense agricultural activities we further point out that while excess n2 generally provides a good quantitative indication of no3 attenuation in riparian aquifers this approach is challenging in cases where degassing to the atmosphere occurs as such alternative methods such as in situ analysis of inert gases can reveal n2 accumulation in groundwater and provide quantitative information on the fate of biogenic gases in riparian aquifers credit authorship contribution statement yeojin ju investigation formal analysis data curation writing original draft dong chan koh conceptualization methodology

15081,riparian zones with their buffering ability and abundant water supply are often subjected to intensive agricultural activities we investigated a riparian aquifer located near a stream in south korea that recently experienced sharply decreasing groundwater levels and elevated nitrate no3 concentrations which were attributed to local agricultural activities our goal was to identify the predominant nitrogen sources and no3 removal processes multiple approaches including geochemical and isotopic tracers land use analysis metabolic gene quantification and inert gas tracers were used to elucidate groundwater and nutrient dynamics in stream side granitic aquifers the dual isotopic composition of no3 identified manure and sewage as the major sources of no3 contamination denitrification was the dominant no3 removal process in the aquifer as demonstrated by the negative relationship between Î´15n and Î´18o values in no3 and no3 cl denitrification and anammox genes were also observed in microbial communities of the aquifer throughout the study site suggesting that these processes support effective natural no3 attenuation in groundwater a mixing model constructed using a catchment scale dataset including sio2 concentrations and Î´18o h2o suggested that mixing with paddy soil water was the major driver of denitrification in the aquifer at the study site where impervious layers provided anaerobic conditions for natural no3 attenuation denitrification reduced the no3 flux into the nearby stream by up to 114 4 no3 kg ha y 26 kg n ha y the n2 generated by denitrification did not accumulate in the groundwater but mostly escaped from groundwater to the atmosphere as demonstrated by the degassed signature of dissolved inert gases below the air saturated water level this study identified the predominant no3 sources and conceptualized n cycling in the heavily developed agricultural riparian aquifer using multiple tracers demonstrating that no3 is partially removed through denitrification and possibly anammox while n2 mostly escapes into the atmosphere graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrate riparian aquifer denitrification anammox natural attenuation noble gas data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface water bodies are often hydraulically connected to adjacent groundwater systems and are involved in the transfer of nutrients winter 1999 tian et al 2015 groundwater discharge can transport nutrients such as nitrate no3 into streams resulting in eutrophication walvoord and striegl 2007 river water can infiltrate and affect the water chemistry of nearby aquifers hosono et al 2013 buffer zones between groundwater and streams can physically filter contaminants and provide spaces and suitable biogeochemical conditions for a wide variety of microorganisms capable of naturally removing contaminants hiscock and grischek 2002 gu et al 2012 numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of riparian zones in rural areas and have highlighted the ability of stream side areas to attenuate no3 a nutrient and contaminant that is often of agricultural origin hill 1996 burt et al 1999 groffman and crawford 2003 the stable isotope composition of no3 is extensively used to deterministically identify nitrite sources in groundwater based on dual stable isotope mixing models using Î´15n and Î´18o in dissolved no3 aravena et al 1993 mayer et al 2002 liu et al 2006 wankel et al 2009 widory et al 2013 however nitrogen containing contaminants can be further altered by biogeochemical transformation processes which often result in variable isotope fractionation and concentration changes kendall 1998 nitrification often results in low Î´15n no3 values whereas no3 attenuation under anaerobic conditions simultaneously enriches 15n and 18o in the remaining fraction as no3 concentrations decrease fukada et al 2003 kendall et al 2007 trauth et al 2018 this bacterially mediated process such as denitrification and anammox converts reactive nitrogen species to n2 gas and its occurrence has been demonstrated by the abundance of specific biomarkers e g nitrous oxide reductase nosz and hydrazine oxidase hzo genes indicating the efficient natural attenuation of no3 in agricultural soils long et al 2013 incomplete denitrification of no3 can also result in the formation and accumulation of n2o which is a potent greenhouse gas deurer et al 2008 mcaleer et al 2017 natural no3 attenuation via microbial activity generates and accumulates n2 in groundwater to levels higher than the air equilibrium level vogel et al 1981 wilson et al 1990 popp et al 2020 by measuring excess n2 it is possible to estimate the amount of no3 originally present in groundwater heaton and vogel 1981 feast et al 1998 puckett and cowdery 2002 kennedy et al 2009 this approach has become more feasible with the development of portable mass spectrometers capable of measuring n2 o2 co2 and other dissolved inert gases in situ in the field brennwald et al 2016 on site measurements have recently been conducted to quantify the n2 produced from denitrification and have successfully revealed complex biogeochemical pathways in stream side groundwater popp et al 2020 n2 produced via microbial activity can only accumulate in groundwater under completely saturated flow conditions visser et al 2007 produced n2 can be degassed via decreased hydrostatic pressure in anaerobic conditions as demonstrated at agricultural study sites blicher mathiesen et al 1998 this n2 outgassing is often accompanied by depletion of noble gas tracers below the air equilibrium level gilmore et al 2016 stream side aquifers are an abundant water resource worldwide and intensive groundwater development is applied for agricultural purposes kuehn and mueller 2000 hiscock and grischek 2002 this reliable water resource has often a rather constant temperature and is frequently used for growing vegetables and other crops resulting in the intensive seasonal pumping of groundwater from riparian aquifers kwon et al 2017 the distribution of no3 in riparian aquifers can be complex because of the diverse no3 sources and volumetric mixing of various water masses including fresh local recharge from the soil surface infiltrating stream water and regional groundwater influx chen et al 2007 lasagna et al 2016 complex mixing of water masses often causes difficulties in understanding both groundwater and nutrient circulation unless a detailed understanding of the mixing system is obtained mahlknecht et al 2017 koh et al 2018 groundwater mixing is dependent on both aquifer hydraulic properties and the design of groundwater production wells e g screen depth and length and can be investigated by numerical simulation of groundwater solutes green et al 2014 the application of multiple environmental tracer techniques is an alternate approach to elucidate the characteristics of water samples and decipher the mixture of waters obtained from the production wells visser et al 2013 ju et al 2021b the noseongcheon aquifer is one of the best studied groundwater bodies in south korea and previous regional reconnaissance investigations in a 200 km2 catchment revealed the occurrence of nitrification denitrification dilution and evaporation affecting the n cycle koh et al 2010 kwon et al 2020 2022 the current study focused on a heavily agriculturally developed riparian zone of 10 km2 with the objective to elucidate the origin and fate of no3 in the riparian aquifer using multiple approaches including land use information dual isotope no3 compositions nitrogen cycle related metabolic gene analysis and inert gas tracer quantification the goal was to use this novel combination of methods to identify the mechanisms responsible for no3 attenuation within an aquifer discharging into a stream and to quantify the amount of no3 that is removed prior to discharge into surface waters this novel approach included the on site measurement of noble gas tracers to better understand n cycling processes in riparian aquifers subject to intensive seasonal pumping 2 study area the study site is located in the riparian zones of the noseongcheon stream a tributary of the geum river which is located in the mid western part of south korea fig 1 a the noseongcheon stream is 27 7 km long and its catchment area is 202 5 km2 kwon et al 2020 based on core observations from previous drilling of a national groundwater monitoring well ngmw the unweathered bedrock is located approximately 200 m below the ground surface bgs and gradually weathered towards the surface thus forming a regolith aquifer underneath the land surface 10 m thick alluvial deposits occur the aquifer in weathered jurassic granite produces groundwater predominantly from shallow depths 50 m whereas significant groundwater yields below 50 m bgs occur only near tectonic fractures cho et al 2003 therefore aquifer productivity relies predominantly on local groundwater recharge from nearby surface environments while groundwater contributions from distant recharge zones with longer flow paths are of minor importance koh et al 2010 land use in the noseongcheon stream catchment is classified into paddy fields 34 greenhouses 7 dry farmlands 17 residential areas 2 streams 1 forests and grasslands 27 and other types 12 fig 1c a considerable portion of the study area 58 is used for agricultural purposes where dry farmland is generally found in upland areas and rice paddies are located in lowland areas close to streams paddy fields hold 1 m water reservoirs above the surface that is open to the atmosphere and is subject to evaporation during the rice growing season greenhouses are located on alluvial deposits near streams water curtain cultivation systems are used to heat greenhouses during winter which requires a massive amount of groundwater kwon et al 2020 residential areas are generally located in hilly terrain with occasional small to medium sized livestock feedlots no3 contamination of groundwater has been reported at the study site since 2009 up to 83 5 mg l no3 95th percentile which was mainly attributed to local agricultural activities koh et al 2009 2010 kwon et al 2020 potential contaminant sources at the site include cultivation activities in dry farmlands residential areas and to a lesser extent in paddy fields ju et al 2018 kwon et al 2022 reported that n containing nutrients at the site were likely derived from fertilizers used in dry farmlands the average annual use of nitrogenous chemical fertilizers in the chungnam province was estimated to be 160 kg n ha in dry farmlands and paddy fields however nitrogenous fertilizer applications can be as high as 521 kg n ha yr if dry farmlands are dominant mafra 2020 when a national groundwater monitoring well ngmw fig 1c was installed in 2015 the groundwater level in the aquifer was initially 1 m asl since then the groundwater table has sharply decreased at a rate of 0 89 m y for the last five years i e a total of 4 5 m drawdown mainly due to intensive pumping for agricultural activities mostly from november to february figure s1 kwon et al 2022 moreover intensive agricultural activities such as extensive seasonal pumping of groundwater and diverse agricultural land uses strongly affect no3 dynamics in riparian aquifers kwon et al 2022 seasonally the stream recharges the nearby aquifer during the dry season january to march while base flow feeds the stream during the wet season july to mid november 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analysis a total of 18 groundwater samples were collected from domestic wells used for agriculture and households near the noseongcheon stream

to 130 5 all analyses were performed in triplicate a total of 64 water quality datasets were obtained from a catchment scale sampling campaign conducted in the regional watershed approximately 200 km2 including five springs f1 to f5 groundwater from four bedrock wells with depths of 80 150 m bgl b26 b28 b37 b38 and groundwaters from 55 shallow wells with depths 50 m bgl the others koh et al 2010 fig 1b these regional samples were collected between december 2007 and march 2008 from various land use areas such as paddy fields dry farmland residential areas and natural areas throughout the regional catchment the main land use for each site was reported by koh et al 2010 geochemical data such as Î´18o h2o and sio2 aq concentrations were used for statistical analysis in this study 3 2 land use analysis land use and land cover lulc data for the study area were obtained from the korean ministry of environment 2017 where raw data from the korean multi purpose satellite 2 can be accessed for scientific purposes land use activities with the potential for groundwater pollution around sampling points were converted into percentages of occupied portions within a 50 m radius of influence roi to determine entities potentially responsible for no3 contamination or n loading koh et al 2010 ju et al 2018 arcgis pro 2 8 0 software was used to perform spatial analysis of no3 concentrations in groundwater figure s3 shows the relative proportion of potential no3 sources such as paddy fields greenhouses water curtain cultivation systems dry farmland and residential areas

determined using two different approaches first a high correlation between Î´15n or Î´18o values in no3 and no3 cl was assumed to imply a singular no3 origin li et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 which enables the reconstruction of the initial chemical and isotopic composition of the no3 source the initial no3 concentration in groundwater no3 0 a can be defined as 7 n o 3 0 a c l n o 3 i c l i where cl is the measured concentration and no3 i cl i is the initial ratio in the no3 source before biogeochemical transformation the groundwater sample from n02 had the highest no3 concentration of 93 1 mg l fig 2 a which was used for the initial no3 i cl i ratio the second approach to determine the initial no3 0 b concentration was based on the measured no3 and n2 concentrations remaining in groundwater this approach assumed that the n2 mass generated from no3 attenuation accumulated in the aquifer without loss it was also assumed that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra was not prevalent in the riparian aquifer because the samples collected from the riparian aquifer contained narg nirs nosz and hzo genes while no nrfa was detected we also assumed that no3 was completely denitrified to n2 with no reduction of no3 to nh4 and no fractionation of excess air bÃ¶hlke et al 2002 kennedy et al 2009 8 n 2 den n 2 tot n 2 asw n 2 air 9 n 2 air n 2 40 ar air 40 ar tot 40 ar asw

all of the gas entities were expressed as volumetric amount per water mass in standard temperature and pressure ccstp g no3 0 b is the initial concentration of no3 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemical parameters related to no3 contamination the measured hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater obtained from the riparian aquifer are summarized in table 1 no3 concentrations ranged from below the detection limit 0 03 mg l to 93 1 mg l with 3 of 18 samples exceeding the korean and world health organization who drinking water standards of 44 3 mg l equivalent to 10 mg l no3 n two additional samples exceeded the no3 contamination threshold 8 mg l set for south korean groundwater kim et al 2015 fig 2a the distribution of the no3 concentrations was tested for normality using the shapiro wilk test p 0 001 which was rejected at the 0 01 significance level thus the no3 concentration distribution did not follow a log normal distribution in the no3 concentration histogram fig 2a the distribution was highly skewed skewness 2 8 and had multiple peaks this result implies that no3 dynamics in the riparian aquifer are affected by multiple sources and processes otherwise a normal or log normal distribution would have been observed preziosi et al 2010 kim et al 2015 although small amounts of no3 and cl are introduced via atmospheric deposition most no3 and cl originates from contaminant sources in rural areas liu et al 2006 torres martÃ­nez et al 2020 the cl concentration in the groundwater samples ranged from 17 2 to 75 1 mg l in the riparian zone fig 2b the cl concentration distribution was log normal according to the shapiro wilk test p 0 2 suggesting a relatively simple distribution dominated by a single source or process kim et al 2015 although the distribution was skewed skewness 2 3 a cumulative relative frequency plot for the entire cl dataset displayed a smooth curve with a peak occurring at 23 4 mg l cl fig 2b cl can originate from precipitation 3 mg l domestic wastewater 57 mg l and agricultural contaminants 20 mg l at the sampling site koh et al 2010 suggesting that the collected stream side groundwater samples experienced significant contamination from anthropogenic sources groundwater from n02 was characterized by the highest cl concentration 75 1 mg l and a no3 cl molar ratio of 0 71 indicating that this sample was considerably impacted by a sewage source xia et al 2017 in fig 2 the no3 and cl concentrations of stream side groundwater samples blue colour are plotted together with those of samples collected throughout the catchment koh et al 2010 the 18 samples collected in this study displayed distinct distributions the cl concentrations were generally high fig 2b and the cl distribution was characterized by a single peak suggesting the dominance of a single source whereas the no3 distribution had multiple peaks in contrast to the conservative ion cl no3 is reactive and can be consumed by biogeochemical processes particularly under anaerobic conditions ding et al 2014 samples with no3 concentrations below 8 mg l were characterized by dissolved oxygen do 2 mg l except for sample n13 do 3 4 mg l table 1 considering the hydrogeological conditions of the site the low no3 concentrations were likely affected by multiple sources see section 4 3 and at least two processes 1 dilution with infiltrating stream water and 2 bacterially mediated attenuation processes described below 4 2 groundwater recharge sources and residence time stable h2o isotopes can be used to identify the origin and physical and geochemical interactions of groundwater lee et al 1999 comparing Î´18o h2o to Î´d h2o revealed that the groundwater samples from this study plot on the local meteoric water line lmwl characteristic for the rainy season indicating that the groundwater is predominantly recharged locally during the rainy season fig 3 a stream water blue square had an average Î´18o h2o value of 6 8 and an average Î´d h2o value of 48 0 kwon et al 2020 while groundwater samples black circles displayed Î´18o h2o values from 7 7 to 5 7 and Î´d h2o values from 50 6 to 38 6 given the absence of hydrothermal water rock interactions in the study area the stable isotope composition of groundwater is a function of precipitation input which is controlled by latitude continental and altitude effects that are potentially modified by evaporation lee et al 1999 groundwater obtained from sites n01 n02 and n09 which are located at the highest altitude in the study area had the lowest Î´18o h2o and Î´d h2o values consistent with recharge at higher altitudes table 1 the groundwater obtained from these wells had the highest no3 concentrations in the study area fig 2a implying that at least some groundwater was derived from local recharge and was affected by anthropogenic no3 sources near the wells rather than from longer groundwater flow paths linear regression analysis of the Î´18o h2o and Î´d h2o values of groundwater showed a slope of 5 9 which is significantly lower than the slope of 7 9 for the rainy season lmwl this result indicates that groundwater is affected by evaporation during recharge fig 3a lee et al 1999 at the study site a considerable portion of irrigation water is supplied from nearby reservoirs and streams through ditch networks and is impounded in paddy fields from may to september koh et al 2010 evaporation of impounded water enriches 18o and 2h in the remaining water which infiltrates the aquifer and elevates the Î´18o h2o and Î´d h2o values koh et al 2010 groundwater samples plotting on the evaporation line in fig 3a were obtained from wells n03 n04 n05 n06 n07 n11 and n18 which were located in the vicinity of paddy fields fig 1c 3h concentrations in the riparian aquifer ranged from 1 2 to 3 9 tu table 1 with most of the samples having 3h contents 2 tu except for groundwater from n11 n13 and n14 fig 3b elevated 3h contents were observed in groundwater near the stream side zones figure s5 implying that groundwater in these areas is mixed with infiltrating surface water that has a higher 3h content compared to other groundwater or is affected by intensive recent local recharge from the surface in the granitic aquifer silicate weathering buffers acidity from agricultural activity kwon et al 2020 as demonstrated by comparing hco3 and sio2 aq concentrations figure s6 all samples plotted below a 10 1 slope implying that the dissolution of silicate minerals plays a more important role in affecting groundwater chemistry than dissolution of carbonate minerals batsaikhan et al 2018 hounslow 2018 sio2 aq concentrations were negatively correlated with 3h content when 3h 2 tu young water fig 3b while samples with 3h 2 0 tu were not correlated with sio2 aq concentrations at the sampling sites young groundwater originates from recent recharge and is characterized by 3h contents ranging from 2 to 6 tu while groundwater with 3h contents between 0 5 and 2 tu represents mixtures of 3h free old water and young groundwater jung et al 2019 in the study area shallow groundwater is enriched in sio2 aq because of accelerated granite weathering caused by acidity from agricultural activities whereas deeper groundwater has lower sio2 aq concentrations kwon et al 2020 therefore the older groundwater obtained from wells n11 n13 and n14 had moderate sio2 aq concentrations and displayed different trends in sio2 aq concentration and 3h content various groundwater flow paths converge near the stream in the riparian zone and induce the mixing of groundwater of different ages and chemical signatures karan et al 2013 moreover the fractured granitic bedrock aquifer in the study area may provide preferential paths for older groundwater depleted in sio2 aq to migrate toward the shallow riparian aquifer the riparian aquifer at the study site belongs to the nonsan gyeryong watershed and is exposed to three different recharge pathways regional recharge paddy soil water and stream water infiltration kwon et al 2020 the groundwater of the watershed was monitored for basic geochemical water quality parameters by the korean government koh et al 2010 and the results are summarized in table s2 the regional groundwater had elevated sio2 concentrations 44 3 5 1 mg l resulting from granite weathering while the stream water and paddy field water had much lower sio2 concentrations 10 4 3 1 mg l and 14 3 2 2 mg l respectively notably the paddy soil water was characterized by elevated Î´18o h2o 5 1 0 1 due to evaporation of water in the paddy fields a bayesian mixing model was developed to identify the recharge water sources for the riparian aquifer and the catchment scale dataset was used to identify the endmember compositions figure s4 groundwater samples were found to be mixtures of three recharge sources with variable contributions from regional groundwater 16 82 stream water 7 49 and paddy soil water 6 55 depending on the location of the sampling well samples n05 and n06 had high sio2 concentrations caused by acidity from heavy application of fertilizers kwon et al 2020 figure s7 4 3 apportionment of agricultural no3 sources in groundwater dual stable no3 isotopes can be used to identify various no3 sources and reveal biogeochemical transformation processes affecting groundwater bÃ¶ttcher et al 1990 aravena et al 1993 wassenaar 1995 in fig 4 the Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 values of the groundwater samples are plotted in a dual isotope diagram designed to identify no3 sources based on the typical ranges from source data reported in previous studies xue et al 2009 no3 containing groundwater samples from the study site exhibited a wide range of Î´15n no3 values from 8 2 to 28 0 and Î´18o no3 values varied from 2 8 to 23 0 predominantly plotting in the manure and sewage zone fig 4 groundwater samples obtained from n04 n05 n13 n17 and n18 plotted outside the source boundary and had elevated Î´18o no3 values fig 4 the isotopic composition of nitrogen containing compounds in soils and groundwater is affected by biogeochemical transformation processes such as nitrification and denitrification kendall 1998 during nitrification three new oxygen atoms are introduced into newly formed no3 the expected Î´18o no3 values can be calculated in a deterministic way with one oxygen atom coming from atmospheric o2 with a Î´18o value of 23 5 kroopnick and craig 1972 amberger and schmidt 1987 aravena and mayer 2009 and two oxygens derived from ambient h2o hence no3 from nitrification at the study site was expected to have Î´18o no3 values around 7 fig 4 reveals that some samples had Î´18o no3 values close to the expected range whereas several other samples had Î´18o no3 values 10 these groundwater samples were characterized by low do concentrations 2 mg l fig 4 during denitrification 14n and 16o in no3 are preferentially consumed resulting in increasing Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 values in the remaining fraction as no3 concentration progressively decreases bÃ¶ttcher et al 1990 kendall et al 2007 under low do concentrations 1 2 mg l pina ochoa and Ã¡lvarez cobelas 2006 hocaoglu et al 2011 to further assess the significance of no3 attenuation in the riparian aquifer the relationships between no3 concentration and Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 values were evaluated bÃ¶ttcher et al 1990 the conservative tracer cl was incorporated to aid in evaluating the predominant biogeochemical processes mcmahon and bÃ¶hlke 2006 pastÃ©n zapata et al 2014 figure s8 reveals that the Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 values gradually increased as ln no3 cl decreased demonstrating natural no3 degradation compared to the conservative contaminant cl the ratio of the Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 was 1 0 which is consistent with the range of slopes reported for denitrification in previous studies 1 1 to 2 3 1 ju et al 2021a in fig 4 most of the samples with do 2 mg l were aligned with a no3 attenuation trajectory indicating that the groundwater no3 originated from a uniform source and was subsequently affected by a single biogeochemical no3 attenuation process namely denitrification the study area is located in the lower portions of a regional aquifer which is characterized by slow discharge rates kwon et al 2022 and likely results in do consumption hosono et al 2013 notably the low do levels for groundwater samples plotting along the 1 1 slope of Î´15n no3 vs Î´18o no3 fig 4 strongly support the occurrence of microbial no3 attenuation under anaerobic aquifer conditions e g via denitrification rather than dilution by infiltrating stream water otero et al 2009 li et al 2019 groundwater samples from n01 n02 and n09 were characterized by the lowest Î´15n no3 and Î´18o no3 values while having the highest no3 concentrations fig 4 together with the unique h2o isotopic signature i e relatively low Î´18o h2o and Î´d h2o values fig 3a this observation implies that these samples are characteristic of no3 source zones in the upland region of the riparian aquifer a source mixing model was designed for groundwater samples with do 3 mg l n01 n02 n03 and n09 the bmc mixing model produces probability density functions pdfs of the mixing fraction of the end members for the investigated samples from n01 n02 n03 and n09 assuming four potential sources including atmospheric deposition nh4 fertilizer soil n and manure sewage fig 5 the model revealed that manure and or sewage had the highest no3 contribution 71 to 77 in these groundwater samples followed by minor contributions from atmospheric deposition 5 to 12 no3 from soil n 6 to 11 and no3 derived from nitrification of nh4 fertilizers 4 to 9 table s3 groundwater sample n13 was characterized by aerobic conditions do 3 4 mg l and exhibited a different no3 source mixing structure manure and or sewage 59 atmospheric deposition 25 no3 from soil n 9 and no3 derived from nitrification of nh4 fertilizer 7 thus sample n13 was more affected by atmospheric deposition than other samples note that samples affected by microbial no3 attenuation were excluded from no3 source identification no3 contamination of groundwater is frequently associated with agricultural activities barringer et al 1990 eckhardt and stackelberg 1995 nolan 2001 potential no3 contamination source areas were categorized within 50 m distance to the respective sampling points koh et al 2010 ju et al 2018 figure s3 as explained in section 3 2 in linear regression analyses no3 was the dependent variable and the surface areas of the potential no3 sources such as dry farmland paddy fields greenhouses and residential areas were incorporated as explanatory variables the current no3 concentration in groundwater was significantly explained by the residence variable p 0 001 and r2 0 59 table s4 see model 1 3 the added entity dry farmland residential area showed improved performance in predicting the no3 concentration in groundwater with an improved r2 of 0 93 fig 6 suggesting that high proportions of dry farmland and residential area result in high no3 concentrations in groundwater all samples from the riparian aquifer had 3h 1 tu table 1 which implies that groundwater is mostly composed of recently recharged water from the surface koh et al 2005 in consequence the significant relationship between land use area and no3 concentration in groundwater indicates that the no3 distribution is controlled by surface activities above the permeable unconfined aquifer these observations are consistent with observations from previous studies in south korea kim et al 2008 ju et al 2018 and strongly indicate that the surface activities in both dry farmlands and residential areas are the key causes of no3 contamination of groundwater in rural areas of the study site and likely elsewhere in south korea 4 4 biogeochemical processes of no3 attenuation under reducing conditions to obtain novel insights into bacterial mediated no3 attenuation processes the relative abundance of the representative metabolic genes that encode the key denitrification enzymes was quantified through qpcr tomasek et al 2017 deng et al 2020 the distribution of the relative abundance of nitrogen cycle related metabolic genes to 16s rrna gene is shown in fig 7 compared to chemolithotrophic denitrification heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria utilizing organic matter gain more energy which makes them more prevalent in nature park and yoo 2009 di capua et al 2015 no3 attenuation related genes such as narg nirs and nosz were found throughout the samples collected from the riparian aquifer in the study area 14 of 18 samples reported the hydrazine oxidoreductase encoding gene hzo fig 7b d implying that anammox may be prevalent in the study site and may be associated with natural no3 attenuation in the riparian aquifer the occurrence of anammox bacteria can have significant implications for the natural attenuation of nitrogenous contaminant plumes in groundwater smits et al 2009 in a freshwater aquifer anammox contributed 39 90 of n2 production from reduced to oxidized conditions solely as an outcome of natural attenuation smith et al 2015 anammox can occur in contaminated groundwater under anoxic conditions when nitrogenous compounds are present moore et al 2011 although soils provide various favourable niches anammox bacteria are only detected under appropriate conditions such as oxic anoxic interfaces with sufficient concentrations of inorganic nitrogen compounds humbert et al 2010 interestingly the anammox related metabolic gene hzo was also detected in samples characterized by aerobic conditions with elevated do contents for example in sample n09 do 7 25 mg l corresponding to observations in smith et al 2015 fe2 and so4 2 concentrations up to 30 mg l and 142 mg l respectively were observed in the groundwater of the study site with the highest concentrations occurring in concert with the lowest no3 concentrations figure s9 the obligate chemolithotrophic bacterium thiobacillus denitrificans is able to couple the oxidation of various sulfur and reduced iron compounds such as pyrite cardoso et al 2006 with denitrification torrentÃ³ et al 2010 in previous field studies no3 reduction was often associated with pyrite oxidation pauwels et al 1998 juncher jÃ¸rgensen et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 2012 this may be the case also in some portions of this aquifer although further research would be required to confirm this previous studies at the study site reported that the microbial community in the stream side aquifer varied seasonally in dependence of the level of stream water groundwater interactions kwon et al 2020 the current study did not conduct any seasonal sampling and did not reveal significant correlations between the metabolic gene distribution and the distance of groundwater wells from the stream fig 7 this may be due to the complex reaction paths of nitrogenous compounds in and near the riparian zone harvey et al 2013 we have yet to determine the relative importance of anammox and denitrification contributing to no3 attenuation these processes can be evaluated and separated based on the innovative tracing approaches introduced by smith et al 2015 nevertheless the prevalence of narg nirs nosz and hzo throughout samples obtained from the study site implies that natural no3 attenuation is associated with bacterial mediated processes in the riparian aquifer 4 5 dissolved gases measured in situ and implications for n cycling groundwater samples generally have higher concentrations of gases derived from the air that exceed those in air saturated water asw or excess air which is typically due to dissolution of trapped air bubbles near the water table heaton and vogel 1981 the percentage of excess 40ar relative to asw was used as an indicator of the magnitude of excess air positive Î´40ar kennedy et al 2009 11 Î´ 40 ar 40 ar tot 40 ar asw 40 ar asw 100 where 40ar tot is the measured ar concentration in groundwater and 40ar asw is the calculated ar concentration at solubility equilibrium at the regional groundwater temperature bÃ¶hlke et al 2007 fig 8 a reveals that Î´40ar ranged up to 15 8 whereas slightly negative Î´40ar values were observed in groundwater obtained from n01 n02 and n07 these groundwater samples had gas concentrations lower than the asw level indicating that degassing occurred in the riparian aquifer gilmore et al 2016 this implies that no3 attenuation produced n2 was affected by substantial degassing resulting in a loss of dissolved gases from the aquifer groffman et al 2006 degassing is a plausible mechanism for the loss of dissolved gases in the riparian zone when the total partial pressure of dissolved gases exceeded the hydrostatic pressure blicher mathiesen et al 1998 dissolved n2 in groundwater can be used to identify the extent of biogeochemical no3 attenuation in polluted groundwater vogel et al 1981 we evaluated n2 accumulation from no3 attenuation in groundwater by reconstructing the initial contamination level no3 0 b using eqs 8 10 and no3 0 a estimated from eq 7 see section 3 4 for assessment of initial no3 concentrations no3 0 b was estimated from the measured no3 and n2 remaining in the groundwater while no3 0 a was based on the concentration of the conservative tracer cl the initial no3 concentrations were estimated using two different approaches no3 0 a and no3 0 b these concentrations are compared in fig 8c for most samples the calculated no3 0 a was higher than the no3 0 b calculated from the remaining gases this difference was up to 947 Âµm in sample n07 which implies that n2 produced from no3 attenuation does not accumulate in groundwater but is partially lost via outgassing from the aquifer note that the groundwater samples n01 03 and n09 were at the initial point in the no3 attenuation trend see fig 4 and had the lowest amount of generated n2 further these samples had the smallest difference between no3 0 and no3 which was less than 180 Âµm n01 in situ measured 40ar and 84kr concentrations were used to evaluate no3 attenuation in the local groundwater fig 9 the noble gas signatures indicated that the local groundwater was recharged in the temperature range of 5 20 c which is consistent with temperatures after the last glacial maximum seltzer et al 2021 ju et al 2022 these samples showed a typical excess air component of 0 005 cm3 stp g ju et al 2022 most of the samples from this study plotted below the air equilibrated line blue line in fig 9 suggesting that the groundwater was not contaminated by air inclusions samples that plotted below the typical asw boundary red dots indicate dissolved gas depletion or loss in this portion of the aquifer this phenomenon was previously observed in agricultural areas where stripping of biogenic gases such as n2 ch4 or co2 over dissolved gases often results in the depletion of low solubility noble gases below the asw level under anaerobic conditions zhou et al 2005 lightfoot et al 2022 for example visser et al 2007 observed noble gas concentrations below atmospheric equilibrium in 20 of 34 groundwater samples from agriculturally polluted sandy aquifers in the netherlands degassing is likely associated with anoxic biogeochemical processes that are accompanied by n2 production since most samples exhibited dissolved oxygen concentrations 2 mg l rivett et al 2008 fig 8b therefore the depletion of noble gases observed in groundwater samples n01 n03 n05 n07 and n08 implies that no3 attenuation accompanied with n2 production occurs in the aquifer while produced n2 escapes from the aquifer agricultural activities in paddy fields and water curtain cultivation activities at the study site require large amounts of water extraction from the aquifer a massive amount of water is pumped from production wells and used to maintain the elevated temperatures required to cultivate vegetables during the winter season irrigation is also required to maintain shallow water levels in paddy fields between late spring and autumn the intensive agricultural activities at the study site resulted in a markedly and progressively decreasing groundwater level which decreased at a rate of 0 89 m y figure s1 thereby inducing an instant pressure reduction in shallow depths during groundwater pumping operations this reduced pressure likely contributed to degassing in the shallow riparian aquifer in fig 8c the discrepancy between the initial no3 concentrations estimated using isotope data blue bar and the summation of remaining no3 and n2 green bar for several samples strongly suggests that no3 originating from anthropogenic activities was partially converted to n2 and then returned to the atmosphere due to outgassing from the aquifer overexploiting the groundwater depressurized the aquifer and released dissolved gases into the atmosphere which likely also released some n2o a potent greenhouse gas into the atmosphere although the types of accumulated gases in groundwater differ depending on the redox conditions of the systems mcaleer et al 2017 n2o produced by denitrification accumulates in groundwater with intermediate o2 concentrations at the transition from oxic to anoxic conditions deurer et al 2008 future extension of this study could investigate and quantify the sources and processes explaining the relative abundances of n2o and n2 in specific sections of the aquifer for example saggar et al 2013 revealed that factors such as soil n and carbon c contents ph temperature oxygen supply and water content can affect the n2o and n2 production ratios during denitrification such future measurements may reveal which factors control the denitrifier populations and enzyme activities and hence affect the relative production of n2o and n2 in the riparian aquifer reconstructed n2 no3 0 a no3 production is plotted against the mixing fractions of the three water sources regional groundwater stream water and paddy soil water as shown in fig 10 where each mixing fraction adds up to 1 the amount of estimated n2 was negatively correlated with groundwater contribution and was positively correlated with water contributions from paddy fields implying that the environment in paddy fields is favourable for the biogeochemical transformation of no3 to n2 via no3 attenuation the area of paddy field occurrence relates well to anaerobic conditions in groundwater for example samples from wells n04 n07 n11 and n18 which had the largest fractions of paddy soil water 35 55 displayed low do concentrations from 0 11 to 1 14 mg l in contrast the stream water contribution showed a negative or inconclusive relationship with the estimated n2 together with the unique no3 isotopic signatures fig 4 the samples associated with relatively high n2 concentrations imply that extensive no3 attenuation occurred in portions of the riparian aquifer at the study site thus infiltration of paddy soil water plays an important role in natural no3 attenuation in the riparian aquifer by enhancing anaerobic conditions that are favourable for microbes that facilitate no3 attenuation 4 6 effect of no3 attenuation on no3 flux into the stream elevated no3 in groundwater discharges to adjacent surface water through base flow which is a major contributor of no3 in agricultural catchments martin et al 2004 the no3 flux into the nearby stream was calculated for the catchment using eq 12 12 flux n o 3 base flow catchment area where the base flow in the study area with an area of 1018 ha was 5434 m3 d kwon et al 2022 the calculation resulted in a no3 flux to the stream ranging from 42 to 181 kg ha y 9 41 kg n ha y without no3 attenuation at the site table s5 following no3 attenuation the no3 concentrations in groundwater were markedly reduced and the no3 flux towards the stream decreased accordingly table s5 shows that the decreased no3 flux was up to 114 kg ha y 26 kg n ha y at n07 the sampling site with the largest contribution from paddy water to groundwater fig 10 this result confirmed that the no3 attenuation capacity of the riparian aquifer is highest in areas of recharge of anaerobic paddy soil water although the riparian aquifer was recharged by young water 3h 1 tu the aquifer displayed characteristic geochemical signatures that revealed natural remediation of anthropogenic no3 contamination in several parts of the aquifer as evidenced by no3 concentrations isotopic compositions of no3 and microbial markers natural attenuation of anthropogenic no3 contamination was facilitated by the recharge of anaerobic water from the overlying paddy fields no3 attenuation substantially reduced the no3 flux into the adjacent stream up to 26 kg n ha y and the produced n2 partially outgassed into the atmosphere as shown by the in situ measured noble gases 5 conclusions in riparian aquifers under intense agricultural activity variable contributions of paddy soil water infiltrating stream water shallow young groundwater and older regional groundwater result in complicated n delivery from surface environments to groundwater the high correlation between human impacted land use areas and no3 concentrations in groundwater suggests that nitrogenous contaminants predominantly originate from local agricultural activities and wastewater effluents at the investigated site source apportionment using the dual stable isotopic composition for samples unaffected by natural attenuation revealed that no3 in groundwater was mainly derived from manure and or sewage from cultivated land and residential areas the riparian aquifer received considerable recent recharge as indicated by elevated levels of 3h in groundwater due to infiltrating stream water and local recharge from the surface however low do concentrations were also prevalent implying a limited role for stream water mixing in the aquifer at several sites agricultural irrigation activities in paddy fields enhanced the local groundwater recharge carrying young anaerobic soil water into the aquifer thereby likely enhancing bacterially mediated natural attenuation of no3 contamination in contrast to observations that old groundwater facilitates anaerobic conditions for natural contaminant attenuation this study demonstrates that enhanced biogeochemical processes capable of no3 removal can occur as a result of local groundwater recharge originating from paddy fields the relationship between the n and o isotope ratios of no3 and no3 cl revealed significant no3 attenuation in the groundwater of the study site metabolic gene quantification clearly showed that denitrification was predominant in the aquifer with potential additional contributions from anammox indicating that bacterial mediated no3 attenuation was active in groundwater at the study site these processes decreased no3 concentrations in groundwater below the threshold value for anthropogenic contamination despite elevated nitrogen loading from agricultural and residential activities at the study site the in situ measured inert gases suggested that dissolved gases in the groundwater were equivalent to the air saturated level or degassed below this level the distribution of inert gases is affected by the stripping action of biogenic n2 produced via no3 attenuation processes despite efficient no3 attenuation in the groundwater of the study site n2 accumulation in groundwater was not significant the stream side aquifer has been subject to considerable groundwater withdrawal for local agricultural activities which significantly reduced the hydraulic pressure at shallow depths figure s1 resulting in degassing of low solubility gases bacterial no3 attenuation processes produce n2 gas that partially outgasses to the atmosphere this outgassing process also likely releases the potent greenhouse gas n2o into the atmosphere this suggests the need for future research to estimate the flux of individual greenhouse gases from groundwater to the atmosphere to understand the contributions of riparian aquifers with variable groundwater levels to anthropogenic global climate change this study provides novel information on the recharge processes and n dynamics in stream side granitic aquifers subject to intensive agricultural activities accompanied by considerable seasonal groundwater abstraction the integrated approach using geochemical and isotopic tracers land use analysis metabolic gene quantification and inert gas tracer measurements provides crucial insights into the biogeochemical processes of no3 attenuation in riparian aquifers and their impact on adjacent streams these new insights facilitate the implementation of an appropriate water management plan for watersheds with riparian zones under intense agricultural activities we further point out that while excess n2 generally provides a good quantitative indication of no3 attenuation in riparian aquifers this approach is challenging in cases where degassing to the atmosphere occurs as such alternative methods such as in situ analysis of inert gases can reveal n2 accumulation in groundwater and provide quantitative information on the fate of biogenic gases in riparian aquifers credit authorship contribution statement yeojin ju investigation formal analysis data curation writing original draft dong chan koh conceptualization methodology

15082,in high rate activated sludge hras processes reducing the solid retention time srt minimizes cod oxidation and allows to obtain the maximum energy recovery the aim of this research was to operate a pilot plant with an automatic control strategy to assure the hras process stability and high cod fractions removal at very low srt this study combines simulation and experimental tools pilot plant 35 m3 d 1 operating at srt 0 2 d hrt 0 6 h and do 0 5 mg l 1 treating high strength raw wastewater at 18 26 c at variable flow the research includes the effects of temperature influent concentration and mlss reactor concentration over the scod ccod and pcod removal the study points out that the best parameter to control the hras at a low srt is not strictly the srt but rather the reactor mlss concentration operating at 2 000 200mg l 1 assured a stable process despite the large influents variation low svi values of 50 70ml g 1 indicated the good settling properties of the biomass with only a 6 9 cod oxidation a high organic matter removal 57 9 for cod and 56 10 for bod5 was reached the high removal efficiencies for pcod 74 compared to the 29 for scod and 12 for ccod also confirmed the importance of settling efficiency and stability in the hras the direct correlation between cod influent and cod removal makes advisable to use the hras as a replacement of the primary clarifier the hras acted efficiently as a filter for cod and pcod peak loads and in a lesser extent for bod5 while scod peaks were not buffered the adopted model presented a good fit for cod fractions except for pcod when the temperature exceeds 23 c keywords hras process stability cod fraction removal bod5 removal srt simulation hras pilot plant data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the conventional activated sludge cas process has proven its efficacy and adaptability in meeting new effluent quality standards for wastewater for more than a century however it is a high energy consuming process with a significant environmental impact as a result there has been a significant increase in the development of more sustainable technologies aimed at reducing energy consumption and environmental impacts only approximately 35 40 of the influent organic matter measured as cod is removed by primary clarifier pc crites and tchobanoglous 1998 and sent to anaerobic digestion for energetic valorisation as biogas the remaining 60 65 goes directly to cas with its corresponding oxygen consumption seeley 1992 improving the effectiveness of the pc is therefore crucial to reduce the overall electricity consumption huang and li 2000 li 1998 ross and crawford 1985 yetis and tarlan 2002 municipal wastewater with 500 mg l 1 of cod contains around 1 9 kwh m 3 of energy stored in the chemical bonds mccarty et al 2011 while the energy required in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps is in the range of 0 3 0 7 kwh m 3 jimenez et al 2015 therefore there is a great potential for improving the energy recovery in wwtps and several studies proposed to enhance the pc efficiency in order to derivate more cod to anaerobic digestion and reduce the organic load to the following conventional activated sludge different alternatives have been suggested dynamic sand filtration dissolved air flotation chemical enhanced primary treatment and high rate activated sludge hras process sancho et al 2019 the hras process enhances the removal of particulate and colloidal cod pcod ccod and even some of the soluble cod scod with a minimum energy consumption christian et al 2008 constantine et al 2012 jimenez et al 2015 nogaj et al 2015 rahman et al 2019 wett et al 2007 yeshi et al 2014 hras removes the wastewater organic load using two different mechanisms 1 carbon redirection where particulate and colloidal fractions are removed by bioadsorption bioflocculation and redirected into the sludge matrix while soluble biodegradable cod is removed by intercellular storage bioaccumulation microbial growth and carbon oxidation the bioadsorption capacity is usually affected by the size of the organic compounds the shear rate the presence of available sorption sites on the sludge the characteristics of the mixed liquor and the organic loading rate olr modin et al 2016 2 carbon harvesting where redirected organic carbon is recovered through settling without having been metabolized by bacteria and sent to anaerobic digestion modin et al 2016 rahman et al 2016 rosso 2019 one factor that limits carbon harvesting is the settling capability of the biological sludge meerburg 2016 compared the svi of biological sludge at 1 hour and 8 45 h hrt achieving svi values of 76 and 120 ml g 1 respectively and concluded that the lower the hrt was the higher the settleability of biological sludge similar conclusions were drawn by miller 2015 and rahman et al 2019 however jimenez et al 2015 and rosso 2019 found that the low oxidation of organic matter due to the low srt maximizes the organic matter redirection but decreases the settling of biomass and consequently worsens the harvesting different hras configuration have been developed such as a stage and high rate cs carrera et al 2022 rahman et al 2019 rahman et al 2017 proposed the use of the high rate cs process for influents with low organic matter concentrations such as those from a chemically enhanced primary treatment cept process while the use of the a stage process was proposed for effluents with high organic concentrations such as raw wastewater tirkey et al 2022 studied an anoxic hras for nitrogen denitrification and carbon recovery and wett et al 2020 the hras sequencing batch reactor with high thickening capabilities hras process operates at low hydraulic retention time hrt usually below one hour and at low solid retention time however when the hras treats the primary settler s effluent it operates at longer hrt since the percentage of particulate and colloidal fractions are lower thus the hras depends on the wastewater conditions carrera et al 2022 rey martÃ­nez et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 likewise hras working at short hrt presents lower influent flow dilution compared to cas processes hrt of 6 9 h resulting in a limited buffering capacity of the influent changes miller et al 2017 this is not in contradiction with the fact that the hras process reduces the fluctuations of the subsequent nutrient elimination process thus hrt must be long enough to allow the biomass development and the biosorption process while short enough to limit the cod mineralization likewise the srt must be set to optimize the sludge concentration the biomass yield and the efficiency of the system sancho et al 2019 previous studies working with raw wastewater reported the impact of srt hrt and do on the hras performance jimenez et al 2015 in a hras laboratory pilot plant at 0 3 d srt and 20 25 c indicated that srt hrt and do had a high impact on ccod and pcod removal efficiency but lower impact on scod removal rahman et al 2016 in laboratory pilot plants working at 0 3 d srt 20 c observed that hras had higher pcod 74 and cod 67 removal efficiency than high rate cs pcod 55 and cod 54 but similar for scod 56 50 and ccod 35 25 miller et al 2017 in a hras pilot plant at 0 1 0 3 d srt 15 25 c evaluated the use of oxygen do and mlss concentration to control the process there is an optimal srt where carbon capture is maximized 0 25 0 4 days while below ca 0 2 days less cod is oxidized and only a small fraction is removed from the wastewater srt over 1 day leads to an increase of cod hydrolysis and oxidization including a fraction of primary solids jia et al 2020 miller 2015 haider et al 2003 found that working at a srt shorter than one day produced a selection of fast growing bacteria a stage heterotrophic organisms aho that use the scod only partially in accordance with bÃ¶hnke et al 1997 who observed that hras systems only supported aho while cas systems had a rich community of bacteria protozoa and metazoans hauduc et al hauduc et al 2019 indicated that at srts lower than 3 days ahos are preferably developed avoiding cell lysis and endogenous respiration and consequently minimizing oxygen consumption due to the short srt the hras process retains only the aho that can only use rapidly degradable substrates for instance volatile fatty acids vfa and monomers they also proposed a model that includes a readily biodegradable substrate sb split into sb mono and sb poly in addition the flocculation of suspended solids and colloids which correlates closely with the total biomass concentration is affected by the temperature and mixing intensity represented in the model by a flocculation factor a deflocculation process in the recirculation pumping is also considered in the past years modelling tools for hras process have been shown to be critical for improving system performance and designing new systems haider et al haider et al 2003 in hras modelling studies also proposed additional fractioning of scod to justify its incomplete degradation by aho in the hras process their model described the removal of scod omitting cod adsorption later nogaj et al 2015 and takÃ¡cs takÃ¡cs 2021 developed a model to describe the organic substrate transformation in the hras process which included dual soluble substrate utilization production of extracellular polymeric substances eps absorption of soluble substrate storage and adsorption of colloidal substrate until now many hras pilot plant studies have been basically focussed on describing the impact of srt hrt and do on the hras performance however process stability is poorly understood as a novelty this paper addresses the research to ensure a proper stability of the hras process operating an hras pilot plant at extreme conditions srt 0 5 d hrt 1 h and do 0 5 mg l 1 moreover the use of real high strength wastewater at variable flow without temperature correction with a previous anoxic zone and two alternative clarifiers is a significant difference with previous studies furthermore the process performance was validated through the process simulation a comparison that usually lacks in this kind of studies thus the main objective of this study was to evaluate the stability of the hras process at such operating conditions by i maintaining mlss concentration at 2000 mg l 1 as control strategy ii evaluating the removal efficiency of each cod fraction and bod5 and their correlations with key operational process parameters iii monitoring the influent and effluent cod fractions and bod5 in long term operation iv evaluating the cod oxidation v comparing the simulated cod fractions removal efficiency with the pilot plant results 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant description a pilot plant was designed to perform this research following the scheme presented in fig 1 it was operated with pre treated wastewater grit and scum removal from the wwtp of the municipality of montornÃ¨s del vallÃ¨s barcelona ne spain serving a population of 95 000 eq inhabitants with significant load variations due to the industrial activity 30 40 a screen system with a 5 mm mesh was installed to remove tlarge solids from the influent different operation periods were designed where the flow rate was set constant or variable to mimic a real wwtp the average daily flow range between 24 1 31 8 m3 day 1 the plant was composed by two 0 8 m3 biological reactors r1 and r2 with 2 m3 h 1 recirculation pump and 0 5 m3 h 1 wasting pump the reactor r1 was installed previous to the aerobic reactor r2 to analyse the effect of flocculation over ccod and pcod removal the pilot plant was provided with two clarifiers 1 0 and 1 4 m diameter that were operated alternatively and allowed to modify the ofr and sl without changing the hrt of the reactor which constituted a singularity of the present study the side water depth in the reactors and settling tanks was 3 0 m aeration in reactor r2 was controlled using a do sensor hach lange and a motorized valve with automatic pid control the air supplied in reactor r1 was only to prevent the accumulation of mlss at the bottom of the reactor the overflow rate was 7 14 m h 1 enough to keep the biomass in suspension 2 2 sampling and analysis the plant was equipped with two automatic samplers to collect and keep refrigerated at 5 c 24 hour influent and effluent integrated samples hach lange the analysis included cod soluble colloidal and particulate bod5 tss vss n tkn n nh4 tp and p po4 3 according to standard methods 26 there were 92 days of representative results of the process days with extreme incidents in the influent were disregarded the cod fractions particulate soluble and colloidal were calculated as follows pcod difference between total cod and filtered cod through 1 5 Âµm scod flocculated znso4 and filtered through 0 45 Âµm mamais et al 1993 ccod difference between pcod and scod the bod5 analysis was performed with seed inoculum from a cas plant not from the hras reactor solid samples were collected twice a week from the reactors and recirculation and were analysed for tss vss and cod always following the recommendations prescribed in the standard methods apha 2005 the pilot plant continuously monitored the following operational parameters do reactor 2 orp bottom of clarifier influent flow rate recirculation flow rate and waste flow rate the suspended solids in the influent reactor r2 effluent and recirculation flow were continuously analysed by means of four digital sensors solitax sensor hach due to biofouling in the reactor the do sensor was equipped with an air blast cleaning mechanism the orp sensor was installed in order to avoid anaerobic conditions in the bottom of clarifier 2 3 pilot plant influent wastewater characteristics table 1 summarizes the average characteristics of the influent including raw wastewater and internal wwtp recirculation it can be observed that cod was composed by a soluble fraction of 25 and particulate and colloidal fractions of 75 this large proportion of non soluble cod makes that the main potential for energy recovery and savings relies on the capture of colloidal and particulate fractions and limiting the oxidation of the soluble fraction the sewage collection system was by gravity which meant that non septic water conditions were present in the influent the standard deviation sd of the averaged parameters is high as usual in a municipal wastewater with high industrial loadings 2 4 pilot plant operating conditions the pilot plant was operated during 497 days running over nine different operational periods the main parameters and conditions of which are summarized in table 2 and table 3 aside from the inherent variations in the influent water characteristics the differences of operational parameters during the different periods were the flow rate constant cf or variable vf according to the schedule in table s1 the point of sludge wasting from the reactor r2 or from the clarifier stl and the settler diameter 1 0 o 1 4 m the hrt on the reactor r2 was 0 6 h periods 1 9 while r1 was operated at hrt 0 6 0 8 h during periods 1 6 the srt was maintained under 0 5 days the srt 0 2 0 05 days was maintained practically constant in the low range during the whole operation to minimize scod oxidation the srt calculations eq s1 supplementary information omitted the biomass in the clarifier the suspended solids in the influent and the suspended solids in the anoxic reactor hydraulic retention time hrt was calculated eq s2 without considering the recirculation flow solids loading sl is the ratio between the amount of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss coming into the settler and the settler surface eq s3 the overflow rate ofr is the ratio between the pilot plant inflow and the settler surface eq s4 the sludge volume index svi is the ratio between the solid volume after 30 min of settling 1 l sample and the mlss concentration of reactor r2 mlss was set to maintain a constant mlss concentration between 2 0 and 2 2 g l 1 in reactor r2 thus avoiding overloading in the settling tank eq s5 the organic loading rate olr is the ratio between influent cod load and the inventory of the mlss in r2 eq s6 olr were exceptionally high on periods 3 due to the low mlss and in period 7 due to the high influent cod concentration coarse bubbles were used in reactor r1 only to keep the biomass in suspension and prevent the accumulation of mlss at the bottom of the reactor the hydraulic overflow rate was 7 14 m h 1 in turn in reactor r2 fine bubbles were used for both aeration and mixing the r2 do set point was 0 5 0 2 mg l 1 similar to the half oxygen saturation ko2 0 5 mg l 1 for aho the reactor temperature ranged between 18 5 and 26 3 c without any correction sludge was wasted from reactor r2 only during period 1 and from the bottom of the settling tank during periods 2 9 the wasting pump was run on off at a constant flow rate controlled by the mlss concentration at the reactor r2 which had a set point of 2 000 mg l 1 without any other control variable the pilot plant operation design and monitoring were based on prior simulations using the sumo model hauduc et al 2019 the sumo model was selected because it considers the population of both oho and aho and the processes of adsorption and flocculation on readily biodegradable matter i e vfa monomers polymers and colloidal matter the process diagram adopted in sumo simulations the main parameters for oho and aho growth and the equations to calculate operating conditions are detailed in fig s1 and table s2 2 5 cod mass balance calculation the cod balance was calculated twice a week on tuesdays and thursdays according to the expression 1 c o d i n c o d o u t c o d w c o d o x i d where codin is the influent daily flow multiplied by the average inlet cod concentration codout is the effluent daily flow multiplied by the average outlet cod codw is the waste daily flow multiplied by average waste cod and codoxid is the mineralized cod codoxid which closes the mass balance between inlet outlet and waste equals the oxygen consumption the removed cod included both the wasted and the oxidized cod thus codw is lower than the removed cod 3 results and discussion 3 1 process control and operation in order to evaluate the efficiency of the technology under different operational parameters the hras as pilot plant was operated during 497 days over 9 different periods table 2 and table 3 treating raw wastewater coming from grid and grease removal units which constituted a significant step forward from the previous studies performed with the primary clarifiers pc effluent during periods 1 3 the inflow regime was maintained constant 24h d 1 in periods 4 9 it changed according to the time table provided in table s1 from period 7 on only the reactor r2 was operated to evaluate the performance in the absence of the anoxic reactor r1 finally from period 6 on the clarifier was changed to increase the diameter from 1 m to 1 4 m in order to analyse the influence of overflow and sludge loads in the clarifier without changing the hrt in the reactor r2 the complexity of the hras technology lies in maintaining the process stability operating at such short specific srt in the conventional activated sludge cas process where the srt ranges between 6 and 12 days the reactor biomass is large enough to absorb the influent s variations however the short str 0 5 days and hrt r2 60 min together with the lack of preliminary pc makes the hras process sensitive to the influent s variations considering that there is a lack of automatic hras process control in previous studies the control strategy appointed in this study was to maintain a constant mlss reactor concentration of 2000 200 mg l 1 this low reactor mlss concentration keeps from reactor biomass washout lowering settling tank solid overload or prevent poor settling sludge like in period 3 mlss below 1500 mg l 1 moreover hras operates at a srt approaching the washout srt conditions based on the maximum growth rate of biomass nogaj et al 2015 fig 2 shows the 24 h profile of the mlss concentration and the waste sludge flow both monitored through the use of in situ on line sensors matching the waste sludge to the mlss set point 2000 mg l 1 ensured the consistency and process stability even with low srt and hrt values likewise the recirculation flow rate was set at 60 of the influent flow rate to avoid the fermentation of the biomass at the bottom of the clarifier the oxygen concentration in reactor r2 was monitored on line to check the efficiency of the control system the oxidation reduction potential orp was also monitored on line to control the reduction conditions and avoid the ch4 generation which leads to cod loss and greenhouse gas generation the values ranged between 150 and 300 mv these results are valuable knowledge in the design of a full scale plants the pilot plant was running both in dry and rain weather which highly impacts the influent cod and ss concentration in any conditions the peak flow rates applied to the pilot plant were as maximum 1 3 times and as minimum 0 7 times the average of the dry flow rate it was observed that in episodes of intense rain the extreme dilution of cod and ss influent cause a decrease in the mlss concentration in the reactor however due to the low str the process can recover the stability within few hours 3 2 performance evaluation for every experimental period table 4 gathers the average concentration and percentage of each cod fraction and bod5 in the influent together with the removal efficiency achieved it should be noted that the removal efficiencies for each fraction indicate not only the effectiveness of the cod removal processes adsorption storage and oxidation but also the efficiency of the settling tank harvesting the cod fractions and bod5 removal for each period is presented in fig 3 as further discussed in the following sections the average cod removal for the entire operation of the pilot plant was 57 9 cod is the sum of each cod fraction and their weight varies constantly during the day and in greater proportion in seasonal changes in general terms the removal efficiencies obtained are significantly higher than those reported in primary clarifiers 35 40 crites and tchobanoglous 1998 and in the same magnitude to those indicated by bÃ¶hnke et al bÃ¶hnke et al 1997 55 for a hras as process on the other hand rahman et al rahman et al 2019 reported efficiencies of 67 applying similar operational conditions but operating at a constant temperature of 20 c while our pilot plant operated at variable temperatures 18 5 26 3 c and it had a negative linear correlation with cod removal fig 4 b the average bod5 removal for the entire operation of the pilot plant was 56 10 significantly higher than those reported in primary clarifiers 35 40 crites and tchobanoglous 1998 and in the same magnitude to those indicated by versrille et al versprille et al 1985 55 for a hras as process the average results during the whole operation on nitrogen and phosphorus removal as tkn and tp were 21 8 13 2 and 56 12 respectively the discussion on the nutrient removal is out of the scope of this study and it will be published in a forthcoming piece 3 2 1 soluble cod removal efficiency the scod average concentration in the raw wastewater ranged from 102 to 222 mg l 1 depending on the experimental period which accounted for and average 29 of the influent cod table 4 reaching values up to 32 in the period 5 scod includes the soluble inert cod the readily biodegradable volatile fatty acids cod vfa the readily biodegradable monomers cod mon and polymers cod poly in turn the collecting systems type gravity pumping length and temperature have a determinant effect in cod fractions according to wilÃ©n et al 2006 the biological processes in the sewer system are predominantly aerobic in high flows and anaerobic in low flows thus changing wastewater properties moreover in an anaerobic sewer collection system the temperature promotes an increase in fermentation rates and in turn increased the scod removal likewise the temperature increases the cod vfa and cod mon fraction stored by aho organisms hauduc et al 2019 reported that at 20 c cod mon was ca 60 of the scod while at 15 c cod mon was ca 40 of the scod the scod removal efficiency achieved in the hras pilot plant had an average value of 29 12 ranging between 19 13 and 36 9 depending on the experimental period these results are in the same order than those indicated by miller 2015 33 12 and by de graaff et al 2016 11 61 jimenez et al 2015 achieved a scod removal of 50 60 working at a do concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 and higher srt of 1 day in order to investigate the scod influent concentration effect over the scod removal efficiency fig 4 shows the relation between codin fractions and the cod removal at 20 c corrected temperature Éµ 1 045 seeley 1992 along the nine experimental periods considered the good correlation indicated that the scod removal was controlled by a biological oxidation storage process according to hauduc et al 2019 at time fig 5 a shows for each period the scod removal the temperature and scodin concentration it can be highlighted that for the same scodin the temperature increase promoted the increase of the scod removal periods 6 and 4 had similar scodin 168 mg l 1 and a temperature difference of 7 c leading to an increase of 10 removal however periods 1 and 3 had similar scodin 180 mg l 1 and a temperature difference of 7 c but the removal increase was only 4 probably due to the lower mlss concentration in period 3 the relation between mlss concentration in the r2 and the scod removal efficiency was investigated at 20 c corrected temperature Éµ 1 045 the results for each operational period are shown in fig s2 where it can be observed that periods 3 2 and 1 with similar scodin and a mlss concentration of 1729 mg l 1 2577 mg l 1 and 3 000 mg l 1 respectively presented scod removal efficiencies of 24 27 and 29 respectively finally the elimination of the anoxic reactor r1 in periods 7 8 and 9 confirmed the non affectation of reactor r1 in scod removal 3 2 2 colloidal cod removal efficiency the ccod average concentration in the raw wastewater ranged from 54 to 83 mg l 1 depending on the experimental period which accounted for and average 9 of the influent cod in general terms the removal of ccod was between 4 and 24 table 4 with a noticeable increase during period 7 which corresponds to a significant increase in the inlet ccod the effect of the inlet ccod with the removal efficiency was investigated resulting a first order kinetics shown in fig 4a where the higher the inlet the more removal efficiency unlike that indicated by bunch and griffin bunch and griffin jr 1987 who proposed zero order kinetics it is important to highlight that during the first operational stage the results led to negative ccod removal due to the fact that the deflocculation produced by the high recirculation pumping was higher than the flocculation process to remove ccod in the design of the hras process equipment such as pumps and agitators the minimization of this deflocculation effect must be taken into account increased ccod in the effluent was also reported by miller 2015 negative removals of 28 due to the conversion of scod into non flocculated colloidal biomass and by bisogni james bisogni and lawrence 1971 at short srts as a result of dispersed biomass growth hras has been observed as bio flocculation limited by low ccod removal efficiency which may potentially be due to lack of eps production kinyua et al 2017 likewise decay processes and large clarifier hydraulic retention times can produce colloidal material hauduc et al 2019 3 2 3 particulate cod removal efficiency the pcod constituted the major part of the inlet cod 66 with an average influent concentration of 453 mg l 1 ranging from 359 to 766 mg l 1 depending on the experimental period table 4 the removal of the pcod which controls the overall cod removal because of its largest contribution is associated with the adsorption onto biomass flocs by electrostatic interactions due to the biological activity moreover the settling characteristics are determining in the hras process for the gravity separation of particulate matter the relationship between pcod removal over the nine experimental periods and the following variables solid loading sl overflow rate ofr pcodin concentration mlss and temperature are show in fig 5 the solids loading sl did not affect pcod removal due to the high sludge settling properties low svi30 49 67 ml g 1 table 3 compared to 110 180 ml g 1 in cas processes seeley 1992 and similar to the values reported by bÃ¶hnke et al 1997 40 90 ml g 1 miller 2015 85 26 ml g 1 van winckel et al 2019 88 81 ml g 1 and rahman et al 2019 88 18 ml g 1 in their hras pilot plant studies furthermore the variation in the sl did affect the effluent suspended solid ss concentration fig 6 a although its impact was also linked to the variation in the overflow rate ofr at turn ofr did not affect pcod fig 6b removal due to the high sludge settling properties the variation of the ofr did however affect the effluent suspended solid ssout concentration although its impact was also linked to the variation in sl fig 6a the pcodin concentration had slight effect on the pcod removal efficiency fig 4 period 4 with an average pcod removal efficiency of only 61 corresponded mainly to august the combination of both low pcodin load and the high temperature 26 3 c of this period explains the low efficiency achieved pcod removal remained at high values 70 80 regardless of the pcodin concentration at time fig 5b shows for each period the pcod removal the temperature and the pcodin concentration it can be highlighted that for a given pcodin the temperature increase promoted a decrease of the pcod removal comparing periods 6 8 and 4 at similar pcodin 372 mg l 1 and mlss concentration of 2290 mg l 1 2010 mg l 1 and 2555 mg l 1 respectively and a temperature variation of 19 3 c 23 2 c and 26 3 c resulted on a pcod removal of 77 71 and 61 respectively suggesting that temperature has a negative contribution on pcod removal on the one hand as previously indicated by jorand et al 1995 temperature does not affect the pcod bioadsorption process on the other hand increasing the temperature leads to a decrease in the viscosity of the medium and should consequently cause better settling of the biological flocs the behaviour observed may be related to the increased hydrolysis and decay process rate with temperature nogaj 2015 takÃ¡cs 2021 i e the redissolution of the pcod into the settling tank another factor that produces an increase in hydrolysis is the continuous arrival of oho heterotrophic organisms in the influent from the internal return line however here other processes seem to be occurring most likely the viscosity of the sludge decreases with increasing temperature which results in less efficient particle capture in the settler the mlss concentration in the reactor had a good correlation with the pcod removal for all periods fig s3 since it promoted the flocculation and entrapment of particulate matter in biological flocs hauduc et al 2019 e g pcod removal efficiency was 6 higher in period 2 mlss 2577 mg l 1 than in period 3 mlss 1729 mg l 1 nevertheless the biomass activity in a hras process without primary clarifier is not as constant as in a cas process and its characteristics are highly affected by the concentration and composition of the influent ss for a mlss concentration below 1500 mg l 1 the settling began to worsen the control system implemented in the pilot plant maintained mlss at 2312 404 mg l 1 thus promoting pcod removal efficiency considering that the srt values were practically constant during the whole operation and that the eps content depends on the srt applied rahman et al 2016 the analysis of the eps production and its effects were out of the scope in this study previous studies did not identified a significant influence of eps on the bioflocculation and settling at short srts elliot 2016 kinyua et al 2017 moreover the hras removed the pcod that would had been removed in a primary clarifier regardless of the biological activity in summary the variables exerting the greatest effect on pcod removal were the temperature the pcodin and the mlss concentration in the aerobic reactor r2 the ofr and sl in the settling tank had a minor impact on the pcod removal the pcod removal efficiency was higher than a value of 65 reported by jimenez et al 2015 with a srt of 0 5 days and do of 0 5 mg l 1 and was also higher than a value of 55 reported by miller et al 2013 the above confirms the robustness and success of the automatic control strategy which maintained a fixed mlss concentration in the reactor this is to be noted since this is the first study operated at a quite constant mlss that achieved such high removal efficiencies 3 2 4 total cod cod removal is the sum of each cod fraction s removal the weight of each cod fraction changes constantly during the day and in greater proportion in seasonal periods codin concentration had a good correlation with cod removal fig 4 temperature effect that on pcod removal fig 5b which was not offset by the positive effect on scod removal fig 5a because the pcod fraction was much higher than the scod fraction the increase of biomass concentration in the reactor led to a slight increase of the pcod and thus cod removal efficiency fig s4 as a summary it is important to highlight the correlation between influent cod fractions and cod fractions removal as shown in fig 4 the ccod removal presented highly dispersed values for a minimum variation in low influent concentrations 30 60 mg l 1 the scod removal presents less dispersed values for a high range of influent concentrations 40 250 mg l 1 and the pcod removal present a minimal dispersion values for a high range of influent concentrations 350 800 mg l 1 this highlights the importance of pcod removal like remarked by guven et al 2019 and to a lesser extent of scod removal the high dispersion of ccod removal values and the low weight of ccod in the total cod make this cod fraction the least important in the control of the hras process from the standpoint of energy recovery the key point is to harvest as much cod as possible guven et al 2019a nevertheless it is critical to differentiate the removal of each cod fraction given their importance in the subsequent nitrification denitrification process an increase of soluble cod in effluent hras would result in a quickly removal during the aerobic cycle thus decreasing the cod available for denitrification in the anoxic cycle regmi et al 2014 as a novelty of this study the cod fractions removal analysis has been additionally carried out in periods of six hours fig s5 shows the scod and pcod in the influent load and in the effluent for each 6 hour period together with the amount removed in periods 13h 18 h and 19h 24 h the scod and pcod load increased compared to periods 01h 06 h and 07h 12 h while the scod remained constant during the day ca 90 g h 1 the pcod removed increased with the pcod load more detailed hourly monitoring will be of interest in further development of the hras technology 3 3 effect of srt over cod removal the hras pilot plant was operated with the goal to maintain the mlss constant as process control parameter the srt 0 1 0 4 days resulting from the mlss control was correlated with cod removal efficiency to evaluate the effect of the srt on the system performance fig 7 shows the correlation between str and each cod fraction removal during the whole operation time with data divided into the different ranges of temperature conditions it can be observed that there is no correlation in any case indicating that srt value was not a determining factor in cod fractions removal at so low srt which is in agreement with the conclusions reported by rahman et al 2017 3 4 cod mass balance the cod mass balance was calculated for each experimental period in order to investigate the efficiency of the process in terms of cod sent to digestion and cod oxidized fig 8 shows the results of the mass balance for each period in general terms the oxidation was low under the values reported by haider et al 2003 12 codoxid at str 0 1 d miller et al 2017 14 codoxid at str1 d and taboada santos et al 2020 16 codoxid at str 0 9 d thus the hras working at low srt 0 2 0 05d low do 0 5 0 2 mg l 1 and the already reported high variations in the influent load permitted to send to digestion an average 55 of the influent cod with a low average oxidation of 6 9 3 6 and maintaining the codout around 40 for almost every period 3 5 bod5 removal bod5 removal follows the same pattern than cod removal presented in fig s6a the cod and bod5 removal rates were similar 57 9 and 56 10 respectively table 4 fig s6b presents the correlation between cod and bod5 removed approximately 38 of cod removed was bod5 likewise the bod5 cod ratios in the influent and effluent were the same 40 and 40 respectively indicating no variation in water degradability features overall the hras influent and effluent concentrations of cod cod fractions and bod5 for each period are presented in fig s7 as it has been noted before section 3 2 the bod5 removal efficiencies also include bod5 carbon redirection process adsorption storage and oxidation and also the bod5 carbon harvesting process settling and waste figs s6 and s7 also indicate the high scod pcod cod and bod5 removal and the buffering capacity of hras process 3 6 long term stability evaluation after analysing the average removal efficiencies of each period for the different cod fractions fig 9 and 10 show the daily evolution of codin and codout throughout all the experimental time for each cod fraction and bod5 it can be observed that the hras process did not act as a filter for scodin peak loads fig 9a as it did for pcod fig 9b since the high dispersion in scodin 171 61 mg l 1 was matched by a high dispersion in scodout 121 44 mg l 1 on the contrary of pcod fig 10b there was not a clear correlation between the inlet concentration of scod and the removal efficiency fig 10a the maximum scod removed was 140 mg l regardless of the influent concentration since similar absolute removal value was achieved at inlet concentration of 230 290 and 380 mg l thus the system presented a maximum scod removal capacity as usual of biological processes however the hras process acted as a filter for pcodin peak loads fig 9b buffering the loads to the subsequent activated sludge process even with the high dispersion in pcodin 456 200 mg l 1 the pcodout values presented a low dispersion 106 34 mg l 1 and the maximum and average values of pcod removal were 1280 and 349 198 mg l 1 respectively the almost totally parallel relationship between the pcod removal regression line and the line representing the total pcodin removal dotted line fig 10b indicates the presence of a non settling pcod that could not be removed and was independent of the pcodin concentration accordingly the hras process acted as a filter for codin peak loads fig 9c buffering the inlet loads to the subsequent activated sludge process there was a high dispersion in codin 683 214 mg l 1 that was buffered in the process with a low dispersion in codout 280 63 mg l 1 thus buffering the organic loads to the subsequent activated sludge process the maximum and average cod removal values were 1300 and 403 195 mg l 1 respectively the almost total parallel relationship between the regression line of cod removal and the line representing total codin removal dotted line fig 10c indicates that a constant amount of cod could not be removed and independently from the codin concentration this non removable cod included non settling pcod scod poly and non flocculated ccod under the pilot plant s operating conditions hence the overall cod removal efficiency was lower due to the lower scod removal efficiency in comparison with the pcod removal efficiency improvement on cod removal could only be achieved by either increasing scod oxidation with the consequent energy consumption or by improving the pcod removal associated with improved settling regarding the bod5 loading the hras process acts as a filter for bod5 in peak loads fig 9d and it buffers the organic loads to the subsequent activated sludge process the high dispersion in bod5in 253 110 mg l 1 is matched by a low dispersion in bod5out 112 59 mg l 1 the maximum and average values of bod5 removal were 600 and 154 95 mg l 1 respectively the almost total parallel relationship between the regression line of bod5 removal and the line representing total bod5 removal dotted line fig 10d indicates the presence of a bod5 that could not be removed which includes the non settling bod5 and the nonbiodegradable bod5 at short hrt increased bod5 removal could be by achieved by increasing biodegradation with the consequent energy consumption or by improving the removal of particulate bod5 which is associated with improved settling as indicated for cod overall the hras process made it possible not only to send larger amount of organic matter to anaerobic digestion 58 60 of the codin and 49 67 of the bod5in compared to the 35 40 achieved with primary clarifier crites and tchobanoglous 1998 but also to laminate the influent load to the activated sludge unit assuring its stability and reducing the size of the equipment to be installed in the unit to handle oxygen demand peaks 3 7 process simulation process simulations were carried out by means of sumo 19 software according to the model configuration detailed in the fig s1 with the goal of testing its capability to predict the removal efficiency of the different cod fractions the main parameters used in the model for the growth of ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho and a stage fast growing microorganisms aho are shown in the table s2 the cod fractions used were determined according to the average values of the pilot plant for each period the scod split and oho and aho fraction in the influent total cod were determined according to the default values of the model in comparison with full scale facilities the pilot plant has two specific characteristics low flocculation in the reactor due to wall effects and low deflocculation in the recirculation line due to the use of helicoidal pumps at low speed instead of centrifugal pumps at higher speed thus the most sensitive parameters to be adjusted were the flocculation reduction factor in the reactor Î·floc process to a value of 0 4 reactor r1 and 0 2 reactor r2 and the deflocculation factor in the recirculation line to a value of 10 the first parameter combines all hydrodynamic effects affecting the shear force on the flocs reactor geometry type of aerators and mixers that act on the residual colloids and the second parameter refers to the deflocculation factor in the recirculation line hauduc et al 2019 a reactive three compartment clarifier with a 0 9 flocculation factor in the feed well and sludge blanket was used for the settling model fig 11 presents the efficiencies obtained in the pilot plant versus the predicted with the model scod ccod and pcod removal efficiencies were closely predicted by the model as a function of their corresponding inlet concentrations with additional indication of the temperature for scodin values above 183 mg l 1 the efficiency in the pilot plant was higher than that calculated in the model and for values below 180 mg l 1 the efficiency in the model was higher than that obtained in the pilot plant fig 11a a possible explanation for this is the fact that the saturation constant for the biodegradable organic substrate ks used default constant in the model was lower than the real value as shown in fig 11b the ccod removal efficiencies were closely predicted by the model as function of the ccodin concentration however the large deviation in the experimental results of the ccod data must be considered when analysing the model outcomes finally for pcod simulation the model differs from the pilot plant results for temperatures above 23 c fig 11c which is aligned with the reduction of pcod removal efficiency observed in the pilot plant at highest temperatures fig 4b in this study the model was tested against hras a stage pilot plant operation data and proven to match the cod fraction removal efficiency future research should supplement the current study with a thorough examination of nutrient removal efficiencies in both short and long term hras processes as well as a cod balance and oxygen uptake rates conclusions reducing srt up to 0 2 days and hrt up to 0 6 h corresponding to one third of the usual values reported in hras operation allows a high redirection and harvesting of organic matter 57 9 for cod and 56 10 for bod5 with a minimum 6 9 cod oxidation the different cod fraction removal 29 12 scod 12 35 ccod and 74 10 pcod highlights the importance of settling efficiency and stability in the hras removal efficiencies maintaining the biomass concentration in the reactor at 2000 200 mg l 1 as process control strategy assured a very stable process even with the large variations in the influent so both in short and long term performance the best control parameter at very low srt to ensure the process stability and minimize cod oxidation is not strictly the srt but rather the mlss concentration the biomass concentration was directly correlated with scod and pcod removal while reactor temperature hampered the pcod removal but increased scod the direct relation between influent cod concentration and cod removal makes it advisable to use the hras process as a replacement of the pc stage and not as a downstream treatment afterward settling efficiency and stability showed a great importance in the hras performance the low svi30 values of 50 70 ml g 1 shows the exceptional biomass settling properties while the relatively low ss effluent concentration 50 120 mg l 1 indicated correct flocculation hras as process acts as a filter for the influent cod and pcod peak loads and albeit to a lesser extent for bod5 buffering the influent load to the subsequent cas process the hras as process on the other hand does not act as a filter for scod peak loads which is important regarding the likely subsequent denitrification process the simulation model adopted sumo resulted in a good fit for the scod for pcod there was a good fit except for temperatures above 23 c declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15082,in high rate activated sludge hras processes reducing the solid retention time srt minimizes cod oxidation and allows to obtain the maximum energy recovery the aim of this research was to operate a pilot plant with an automatic control strategy to assure the hras process stability and high cod fractions removal at very low srt this study combines simulation and experimental tools pilot plant 35 m3 d 1 operating at srt 0 2 d hrt 0 6 h and do 0 5 mg l 1 treating high strength raw wastewater at 18 26 c at variable flow the research includes the effects of temperature influent concentration and mlss reactor concentration over the scod ccod and pcod removal the study points out that the best parameter to control the hras at a low srt is not strictly the srt but rather the reactor mlss concentration operating at 2 000 200mg l 1 assured a stable process despite the large influents variation low svi values of 50 70ml g 1 indicated the good settling properties of the biomass with only a 6 9 cod oxidation a high organic matter removal 57 9 for cod and 56 10 for bod5 was reached the high removal efficiencies for pcod 74 compared to the 29 for scod and 12 for ccod also confirmed the importance of settling efficiency and stability in the hras the direct correlation between cod influent and cod removal makes advisable to use the hras as a replacement of the primary clarifier the hras acted efficiently as a filter for cod and pcod peak loads and in a lesser extent for bod5 while scod peaks were not buffered the adopted model presented a good fit for cod fractions except for pcod when the temperature exceeds 23 c keywords hras process stability cod fraction removal bod5 removal srt simulation hras pilot plant data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the conventional activated sludge cas process has proven its efficacy and adaptability in meeting new effluent quality standards for wastewater for more than a century however it is a high energy consuming process with a significant environmental impact as a result there has been a significant increase in the development of more sustainable technologies aimed at reducing energy consumption and environmental impacts only approximately 35 40 of the influent organic matter measured as cod is removed by primary clarifier pc crites and tchobanoglous 1998 and sent to anaerobic digestion for energetic valorisation as biogas the remaining 60 65 goes directly to cas with its corresponding oxygen consumption seeley 1992 improving the effectiveness of the pc is therefore crucial to reduce the overall electricity consumption huang and li 2000 li 1998 ross and crawford 1985 yetis and tarlan 2002 municipal wastewater with 500 mg l 1 of cod contains around 1 9 kwh m 3 of energy stored in the chemical bonds mccarty et al 2011 while the energy required in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps is in the range of 0 3 0 7 kwh m 3 jimenez et al 2015 therefore there is a great potential for improving the energy recovery in wwtps and several studies proposed to enhance the pc efficiency in order to derivate more cod to anaerobic digestion and reduce the organic load to the following conventional activated sludge different alternatives have been suggested dynamic sand filtration dissolved air flotation chemical enhanced primary treatment and high rate activated sludge hras process sancho et al 2019 the hras process enhances the removal of particulate and colloidal cod pcod ccod and even some of the soluble cod scod with a minimum energy consumption christian et al 2008 constantine et al 2012 jimenez et al 2015 nogaj et al 2015 rahman et al 2019 wett et al 2007 yeshi et al 2014 hras removes the wastewater organic load using two different mechanisms 1 carbon redirection where particulate and colloidal fractions are removed by bioadsorption bioflocculation and redirected into the sludge matrix while soluble biodegradable cod is removed by intercellular storage bioaccumulation microbial growth and carbon oxidation the bioadsorption capacity is usually affected by the size of the organic compounds the shear rate the presence of available sorption sites on the sludge the characteristics of the mixed liquor and the organic loading rate olr modin et al 2016 2 carbon harvesting where redirected organic carbon is recovered through settling without having been metabolized by bacteria and sent to anaerobic digestion modin et al 2016 rahman et al 2016 rosso 2019 one factor that limits carbon harvesting is the settling capability of the biological sludge meerburg 2016 compared the svi of biological sludge at 1 hour and 8 45 h hrt achieving svi values of 76 and 120 ml g 1 respectively and concluded that the lower the hrt was the higher the settleability of biological sludge similar conclusions were drawn by miller 2015 and rahman et al 2019 however jimenez et al 2015 and rosso 2019 found that the low oxidation of organic matter due to the low srt maximizes the organic matter redirection but decreases the settling of biomass and consequently worsens the harvesting different hras configuration have been developed such as a stage and high rate cs carrera et al 2022 rahman et al 2019 rahman et al 2017 proposed the use of the high rate cs process for influents with low organic matter concentrations such as those from a chemically enhanced primary treatment cept process while the use of the a stage process was proposed for effluents with high organic concentrations such as raw wastewater tirkey et al 2022 studied an anoxic hras for nitrogen denitrification and carbon recovery and wett et al 2020 the hras sequencing batch reactor with high thickening capabilities hras process operates at low hydraulic retention time hrt usually below one hour and at low solid retention time however when the hras treats the primary settler s effluent it operates at longer hrt since the percentage of particulate and colloidal fractions are lower thus the hras depends on the wastewater conditions carrera et al 2022 rey martÃ­nez et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 likewise hras working at short hrt presents lower influent flow dilution compared to cas processes hrt of 6 9 h resulting in a limited buffering capacity of the influent changes miller et al 2017 this is not in contradiction with the fact that the hras process reduces the fluctuations of the subsequent nutrient elimination process thus hrt must be long enough to allow the biomass development and the biosorption process while short enough to limit the cod mineralization likewise the srt must be set to optimize the sludge concentration the biomass yield and the efficiency of the system sancho et al 2019 previous studies working with raw wastewater reported the impact of srt hrt and do on the hras performance jimenez et al 2015 in a hras laboratory pilot plant at 0 3 d srt and 20 25 c indicated that srt hrt and do had a high impact on ccod and pcod removal efficiency but lower impact on scod removal rahman et al 2016 in laboratory pilot plants working at 0 3 d srt 20 c observed that hras had higher pcod 74 and cod 67 removal efficiency than high rate cs pcod 55 and cod 54 but similar for scod 56 50 and ccod 35 25 miller et al 2017 in a hras pilot plant at 0 1 0 3 d srt 15 25 c evaluated the use of oxygen do and mlss concentration to control the process there is an optimal srt where carbon capture is maximized 0 25 0 4 days while below ca 0 2 days less cod is oxidized and only a small fraction is removed from the wastewater srt over 1 day leads to an increase of cod hydrolysis and oxidization including a fraction of primary solids jia et al 2020 miller 2015 haider et al 2003 found that working at a srt shorter than one day produced a selection of fast growing bacteria a stage heterotrophic organisms aho that use the scod only partially in accordance with bÃ¶hnke et al 1997 who observed that hras systems only supported aho while cas systems had a rich community of bacteria protozoa and metazoans hauduc et al hauduc et al 2019 indicated that at srts lower than 3 days ahos are preferably developed avoiding cell lysis and endogenous respiration and consequently minimizing oxygen consumption due to the short srt the hras process retains only the aho that can only use rapidly degradable substrates for instance volatile fatty acids vfa and monomers they also proposed a model that includes a readily biodegradable substrate sb split into sb mono and sb poly in addition the flocculation of suspended solids and colloids which correlates closely with the total biomass concentration is affected by the temperature and mixing intensity represented in the model by a flocculation factor a deflocculation process in the recirculation pumping is also considered in the past years modelling tools for hras process have been shown to be critical for improving system performance and designing new systems haider et al haider et al 2003 in hras modelling studies also proposed additional fractioning of scod to justify its incomplete degradation by aho in the hras process their model described the removal of scod omitting cod adsorption later nogaj et al 2015 and takÃ¡cs takÃ¡cs 2021 developed a model to describe the organic substrate transformation in the hras process which included dual soluble substrate utilization production of extracellular polymeric substances eps absorption of soluble substrate storage and adsorption of colloidal substrate until now many hras pilot plant studies have been basically focussed on describing the impact of srt hrt and do on the hras performance however process stability is poorly understood as a novelty this paper addresses the research to ensure a proper stability of the hras process operating an hras pilot plant at extreme conditions srt 0 5 d hrt 1 h and do 0 5 mg l 1 moreover the use of real high strength wastewater at variable flow without temperature correction with a previous anoxic zone and two alternative clarifiers is a significant difference with previous studies furthermore the process performance was validated through the process simulation a comparison that usually lacks in this kind of studies thus the main objective of this study was to evaluate the stability of the hras process at such operating conditions by i maintaining mlss concentration at 2000 mg l 1 as control strategy ii evaluating the removal efficiency of each cod fraction and bod5 and their correlations with key operational process parameters iii monitoring the influent and effluent cod fractions and bod5 in long term operation iv evaluating the cod oxidation v comparing the simulated cod fractions removal efficiency with the pilot plant results 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant description a pilot plant was designed to perform this research following the scheme presented in fig 1 it was operated with pre treated wastewater grit and scum removal from the wwtp of the municipality of montornÃ¨s del vallÃ¨s barcelona ne spain serving a population of 95 000 eq inhabitants with significant load variations due to the industrial activity 30 40 a screen system with a 5 mm mesh was installed to remove tlarge solids from the influent different operation periods were designed where the flow rate was set constant or variable to mimic a real wwtp the average daily flow range between 24 1 31 8 m3 day 1 the plant was composed by two 0 8 m3 biological reactors r1 and r2 with 2 m3 h 1 recirculation pump and 0 5 m3 h 1 wasting pump the reactor r1 was installed previous to the aerobic reactor r2 to analyse the effect of flocculation over ccod and pcod removal the pilot plant was provided with two clarifiers 1 0 and 1 4 m diameter that were operated alternatively and allowed to modify the ofr and sl without changing the hrt of the reactor which constituted a singularity of the present study the side water depth in the reactors and settling tanks was 3 0 m aeration in reactor r2 was controlled using a do sensor hach lange and a motorized valve with automatic pid control the air supplied in reactor r1 was only to prevent the accumulation of mlss at the bottom of the reactor the overflow rate was 7 14 m h 1 enough to keep the biomass in suspension 2 2 sampling and analysis the plant was equipped with two automatic samplers to collect and keep refrigerated at 5 c 24 hour influent and effluent integrated samples hach lange the analysis included cod soluble colloidal and particulate bod5 tss vss n tkn n nh4 tp and p po4 3 according to standard methods 26 there were 92 days of representative results of the process days with extreme incidents in the influent were disregarded the cod fractions particulate soluble and colloidal were calculated as follows pcod difference between total cod and filtered cod through 1 5 Âµm scod flocculated znso4 and filtered through 0 45 Âµm mamais et al 1993 ccod difference between pcod and scod the bod5 analysis was performed with seed inoculum from a cas plant not from the hras reactor solid samples were collected twice a week from the reactors and recirculation and were analysed for tss vss and cod always following the recommendations prescribed in the standard methods apha 2005 the pilot plant continuously monitored the following operational parameters do reactor 2 orp bottom of clarifier influent flow rate recirculation flow rate and waste flow rate the suspended solids in the influent reactor r2 effluent and recirculation flow were continuously analysed by means of four digital sensors solitax sensor hach due to biofouling in the reactor the do sensor was equipped with an air blast cleaning mechanism the orp sensor was installed in order to avoid anaerobic conditions in the bottom of clarifier 2 3 pilot plant influent wastewater characteristics table 1 summarizes the average characteristics of the influent including raw wastewater and internal wwtp recirculation it can be observed that cod was composed by a soluble fraction of 25 and particulate and colloidal fractions of 75 this large proportion of non soluble cod makes that the main potential for energy recovery and savings relies on the capture of colloidal and particulate fractions and limiting the oxidation of the soluble fraction the sewage collection system was by gravity which meant that non septic water conditions were present in the influent the standard deviation sd of the averaged parameters is high as usual in a municipal wastewater with high industrial loadings 2 4 pilot plant operating conditions the pilot plant was operated during 497 days running over nine different operational periods the main parameters and conditions of which are summarized in table 2 and table 3 aside from the inherent variations in the influent water characteristics the differences of operational parameters during the different periods were the flow rate constant cf or variable vf according to the schedule in table s1 the point of sludge wasting from the reactor r2 or from the clarifier stl and the settler diameter 1 0 o 1 4 m the hrt on the reactor r2 was 0 6 h periods 1 9 while r1 was operated at hrt 0 6 0 8 h during periods 1 6 the srt was maintained under 0 5 days the srt 0 2 0 05 days was maintained practically constant in the low range during the whole operation to minimize scod oxidation the srt calculations eq s1 supplementary information omitted the biomass in the clarifier the suspended solids in the influent and the suspended solids in the anoxic reactor hydraulic retention time hrt was calculated eq s2 without considering the recirculation flow solids loading sl is the ratio between the amount of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss coming into the settler and the settler surface eq s3 the overflow rate ofr is the ratio between the pilot plant inflow and the settler surface eq s4 the sludge volume index svi is the ratio between the solid volume after 30 min of settling 1 l sample and the mlss concentration of reactor r2 mlss was set to maintain a constant mlss concentration between 2 0 and 2 2 g l 1 in reactor r2 thus avoiding overloading in the settling tank eq s5 the organic loading rate olr is the ratio between influent cod load and the inventory of the mlss in r2 eq s6 olr were exceptionally high on periods 3 due to the low mlss and in period 7 due to the high influent cod concentration coarse bubbles were used in reactor r1 only to keep the biomass in suspension and prevent the accumulation of mlss at the bottom of the reactor the hydraulic overflow rate was 7 14 m h 1 in turn in reactor r2 fine bubbles were used for both aeration and mixing the r2 do set point was 0 5 0 2 mg l 1 similar to the half oxygen saturation ko2 0 5 mg l 1 for aho the reactor temperature ranged between 18 5 and 26 3 c without any correction sludge was wasted from reactor r2 only during period 1 and from the bottom of the settling tank during periods 2 9 the wasting pump was run on off at a constant flow rate controlled by the mlss concentration at the reactor r2 which had a set point of 2 000 mg l 1 without any other control variable the pilot plant operation design and monitoring were based on prior simulations using the sumo model hauduc et al 2019 the sumo model was selected because it considers the population of both oho and aho and the processes of adsorption and flocculation on readily biodegradable matter i e vfa monomers polymers and colloidal matter the process diagram adopted in sumo simulations the main parameters for oho and aho growth and the equations to calculate operating conditions are detailed in fig s1 and table s2 2 5 cod mass balance calculation the cod balance was calculated twice a week on tuesdays and thursdays according to the expression 1 c o d i n c o d o u t c o d w c o d o x i d where codin is the influent daily flow multiplied by the average inlet cod concentration codout is the effluent daily flow multiplied by the average outlet cod codw is the waste daily flow multiplied by average waste cod and codoxid is the mineralized cod codoxid which closes the mass balance between inlet outlet and waste equals the oxygen consumption the removed cod included both the wasted and the oxidized cod thus codw is lower than the removed cod 3 results and discussion 3 1 process control and operation in order to evaluate the efficiency of the technology under different operational parameters the hras as pilot plant was operated during 497 days over 9 different periods table 2 and table 3 treating raw wastewater coming from grid and grease removal units which constituted a significant step forward from the previous studies performed with the primary clarifiers pc effluent during periods 1 3 the inflow regime was maintained constant 24h d 1 in periods 4 9 it changed according to the time table provided in table s1 from period 7 on only the reactor r2 was operated to evaluate the performance in the absence of the anoxic reactor r1 finally from period 6 on the clarifier was changed to increase the diameter from 1 m to 1 4 m in order to analyse the influence of overflow and sludge loads in the clarifier without changing the hrt in the reactor r2 the complexity of the hras technology lies in maintaining the process stability operating at such short specific srt in the conventional activated sludge cas process where the srt ranges between 6 and 12 days the reactor biomass is large enough to absorb the influent s variations however the short str 0 5 days and hrt r2 60 min together with the lack of preliminary pc makes the hras process sensitive to the influent s variations considering that there is a lack of automatic hras process control in previous studies the control strategy appointed in this study was to maintain a constant mlss reactor concentration of 2000 200 mg l 1 this low reactor mlss concentration keeps from reactor biomass washout lowering settling tank solid overload or prevent poor settling sludge like in period 3 mlss below 1500 mg l 1 moreover hras operates at a srt approaching the washout srt conditions based on the maximum growth rate of biomass nogaj et al 2015 fig 2 shows the 24 h profile of the mlss concentration and the waste sludge flow both monitored through the use of in situ on line sensors matching the waste sludge to the mlss set point 2000 mg l 1 ensured the consistency and process stability even with low srt and hrt values likewise the recirculation flow rate was set at 60 of the influent flow rate to avoid the fermentation of the biomass at the bottom of the clarifier the oxygen concentration in reactor r2 was monitored on line to check the efficiency of the control system the oxidation reduction potential orp was also monitored on line to control the reduction conditions and avoid the ch4 generation which leads to cod loss and greenhouse gas generation the values ranged between 150 and 300 mv these results are valuable knowledge in the design of a full scale plants the pilot plant was running both in dry and rain weather which highly impacts the influent cod and ss concentration in any conditions the peak flow rates applied to the pilot plant were as maximum 1 3 times and as minimum 0 7 times the average of the dry flow rate it was observed that in episodes of intense rain the extreme dilution of cod and ss influent cause a decrease in the mlss concentration in the reactor however due to the low str the process can recover the stability within few hours 3 2 performance evaluation for every experimental period table 4 gathers the average concentration and percentage of each cod fraction and bod5 in the influent together with the removal efficiency achieved it should be noted that the removal efficiencies for each fraction indicate not only the effectiveness of the cod removal processes adsorption storage and oxidation but also the efficiency of the settling tank harvesting the cod fractions and bod5 removal for each period is presented in fig 3 as further discussed in the following sections the average cod removal for the entire operation of the pilot plant was 57 9 cod is the sum of each cod fraction and their weight varies constantly during the day and in greater proportion in seasonal changes in general terms the removal efficiencies obtained are significantly higher than those reported in primary clarifiers 35 40 crites and tchobanoglous 1998 and in the same magnitude to those indicated by bÃ¶hnke et al bÃ¶hnke et al 1997 55 for a hras as process on the other hand rahman et al rahman et al 2019 reported efficiencies of 67 applying similar operational conditions but operating at a constant temperature of 20 c while our pilot plant operated at variable temperatures 18 5 26 3 c and it had a negative linear correlation with cod removal fig 4 b the average bod5 removal for the entire operation of the pilot plant was 56 10 significantly higher than those reported in primary clarifiers 35 40 crites and tchobanoglous 1998 and in the same magnitude to those indicated by versrille et al versprille et al 1985 55 for a hras as process the average results during the whole operation on nitrogen and phosphorus removal as tkn and tp were 21 8 13 2 and 56 12 respectively the discussion on the nutrient removal is out of the scope of this study and it will be published in a forthcoming piece 3 2 1 soluble cod removal efficiency the scod average concentration in the raw wastewater ranged from 102 to 222 mg l 1 depending on the experimental period which accounted for and average 29 of the influent cod table 4 reaching values up to 32 in the period 5 scod includes the soluble inert cod the readily biodegradable volatile fatty acids cod vfa the readily biodegradable monomers cod mon and polymers cod poly in turn the collecting systems type gravity pumping length and temperature have a determinant effect in cod fractions according to wilÃ©n et al 2006 the biological processes in the sewer system are predominantly aerobic in high flows and anaerobic in low flows thus changing wastewater properties moreover in an anaerobic sewer collection system the temperature promotes an increase in fermentation rates and in turn increased the scod removal likewise the temperature increases the cod vfa and cod mon fraction stored by aho organisms hauduc et al 2019 reported that at 20 c cod mon was ca 60 of the scod while at 15 c cod mon was ca 40 of the scod the scod removal efficiency achieved in the hras pilot plant had an average value of 29 12 ranging between 19 13 and 36 9 depending on the experimental period these results are in the same order than those indicated by miller 2015 33 12 and by de graaff et al 2016 11 61 jimenez et al 2015 achieved a scod removal of 50 60 working at a do concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 and higher srt of 1 day in order to investigate the scod influent concentration effect over the scod removal efficiency fig 4 shows the relation between codin fractions and the cod removal at 20 c corrected temperature Éµ 1 045 seeley 1992 along the nine experimental periods considered the good correlation indicated that the scod removal was controlled by a biological oxidation storage process according to hauduc et al 2019 at time fig 5 a shows for each period the scod removal the temperature and scodin concentration it can be highlighted that for the same scodin the temperature increase promoted the increase of the scod removal periods 6 and 4 had similar scodin 168 mg l 1 and a temperature difference of 7 c leading to an increase of 10 removal however periods 1 and 3 had similar scodin 180 mg l 1 and a temperature difference of 7 c but the removal increase was only 4 probably due to the lower mlss concentration in period 3 the relation between mlss concentration in the r2 and the scod removal efficiency was investigated at 20 c corrected temperature Éµ 1 045 the results for each operational period are shown in fig s2 where it can be observed that periods 3 2 and 1 with similar scodin and a mlss concentration of 1729 mg l 1 2577 mg l 1 and 3 000 mg l 1 respectively presented scod removal efficiencies of 24 27 and 29 respectively finally the elimination of the anoxic reactor r1 in periods 7 8 and 9 confirmed the non affectation of reactor r1 in scod removal 3 2 2 colloidal cod removal efficiency the ccod average concentration in the raw wastewater ranged from 54 to 83 mg l 1 depending on the experimental period which accounted for and average 9 of the influent cod in general terms the removal of ccod was between 4 and 24 table 4 with a noticeable increase during period 7 which corresponds to a significant increase in the inlet ccod the effect of the inlet ccod with the removal efficiency was investigated resulting a first order kinetics shown in fig 4a where the higher the inlet the more removal efficiency unlike that indicated by bunch and griffin bunch and griffin jr 1987 who proposed zero order kinetics it is important to highlight that during the first operational stage the results led to negative ccod removal due to the fact that the deflocculation produced by the high recirculation pumping was higher than the flocculation process to remove ccod in the design of the hras process equipment such as pumps and agitators the minimization of this deflocculation effect must be taken into account increased ccod in the effluent was also reported by miller 2015 negative removals of 28 due to the conversion of scod into non flocculated colloidal biomass and by bisogni james bisogni and lawrence 1971 at short srts as a result of dispersed biomass growth hras has been observed as bio flocculation limited by low ccod removal efficiency which may potentially be due to lack of eps production kinyua et al 2017 likewise decay processes and large clarifier hydraulic retention times can produce colloidal material hauduc et al 2019 3 2 3 particulate cod removal efficiency the pcod constituted the major part of the inlet cod 66 with an average influent concentration of 453 mg l 1 ranging from 359 to 766 mg l 1 depending on the experimental period table 4 the removal of the pcod which controls the overall cod removal because of its largest contribution is associated with the adsorption onto biomass flocs by electrostatic interactions due to the biological activity moreover the settling characteristics are determining in the hras process for the gravity separation of particulate matter the relationship between pcod removal over the nine experimental periods and the following variables solid loading sl overflow rate ofr pcodin concentration mlss and temperature are show in fig 5 the solids loading sl did not affect pcod removal due to the high sludge settling properties low svi30 49 67 ml g 1 table 3 compared to 110 180 ml g 1 in cas processes seeley 1992 and similar to the values reported by bÃ¶hnke et al 1997 40 90 ml g 1 miller 2015 85 26 ml g 1 van winckel et al 2019 88 81 ml g 1 and rahman et al 2019 88 18 ml g 1 in their hras pilot plant studies furthermore the variation in the sl did affect the effluent suspended solid ss concentration fig 6 a although its impact was also linked to the variation in the overflow rate ofr at turn ofr did not affect pcod fig 6b removal due to the high sludge settling properties the variation of the ofr did however affect the effluent suspended solid ssout concentration although its impact was also linked to the variation in sl fig 6a the pcodin concentration had slight effect on the pcod removal efficiency fig 4 period 4 with an average pcod removal efficiency of only 61 corresponded mainly to august the combination of both low pcodin load and the high temperature 26 3 c of this period explains the low efficiency achieved pcod removal remained at high values 70 80 regardless of the pcodin concentration at time fig 5b shows for each period the pcod removal the temperature and the pcodin concentration it can be highlighted that for a given pcodin the temperature increase promoted a decrease of the pcod removal comparing periods 6 8 and 4 at similar pcodin 372 mg l 1 and mlss concentration of 2290 mg l 1 2010 mg l 1 and 2555 mg l 1 respectively and a temperature variation of 19 3 c 23 2 c and 26 3 c resulted on a pcod removal of 77 71 and 61 respectively suggesting that temperature has a negative contribution on pcod removal on the one hand as previously indicated by jorand et al 1995 temperature does not affect the pcod bioadsorption process on the other hand increasing the temperature leads to a decrease in the viscosity of the medium and should consequently cause better settling of the biological flocs the behaviour observed may be related to the increased hydrolysis and decay process rate with temperature nogaj 2015 takÃ¡cs 2021 i e the redissolution of the pcod into the settling tank another factor that produces an increase in hydrolysis is the continuous arrival of oho heterotrophic organisms in the influent from the internal return line however here other processes seem to be occurring most likely the viscosity of the sludge decreases with increasing temperature which results in less efficient particle capture in the settler the mlss concentration in the reactor had a good correlation with the pcod removal for all periods fig s3 since it promoted the flocculation and entrapment of particulate matter in biological flocs hauduc et al 2019 e g pcod removal efficiency was 6 higher in period 2 mlss 2577 mg l 1 than in period 3 mlss 1729 mg l 1 nevertheless the biomass activity in a hras process without primary clarifier is not as constant as in a cas process and its characteristics are highly affected by the concentration and composition of the influent ss for a mlss concentration below 1500 mg l 1 the settling began to worsen the control system implemented in the pilot plant maintained mlss at 2312 404 mg l 1 thus promoting pcod removal efficiency considering that the srt values were practically constant during the whole operation and that the eps content depends on the srt applied rahman et al 2016 the analysis of the eps production and its effects were out of the scope in this study previous studies did not identified a significant influence of eps on the bioflocculation and settling at short srts elliot 2016 kinyua et al 2017 moreover the hras removed the pcod that would had been removed in a primary clarifier regardless of the biological activity in summary the variables exerting the greatest effect on pcod removal were the temperature the pcodin and the mlss concentration in the aerobic reactor r2 the ofr and sl in the settling tank had a minor impact on the pcod removal the pcod removal efficiency was higher than a value of 65 reported by jimenez et al 2015 with a srt of 0 5 days and do of 0 5 mg l 1 and was also higher than a value of 55 reported by miller et al 2013 the above confirms the robustness and success of the automatic control strategy which maintained a fixed mlss concentration in the reactor this is to be noted since this is the first study operated at a quite constant mlss that achieved such high removal efficiencies 3 2 4 total cod cod removal is the sum of each cod fraction s removal the weight of each cod fraction changes constantly during the day and in greater proportion in seasonal periods codin concentration had a good correlation with cod removal fig 4 temperature effect that on pcod removal fig 5b which was not offset by the positive effect on scod removal fig 5a because the pcod fraction was much higher than the scod fraction the increase of biomass concentration in the reactor led to a slight increase of the pcod and thus cod removal efficiency fig s4 as a summary it is important to highlight the correlation between influent cod fractions and cod fractions removal as shown in fig 4 the ccod removal presented highly dispersed values for a minimum variation in low influent concentrations 30 60 mg l 1 the scod removal presents less dispersed values for a high range of influent concentrations 40 250 mg l 1 and the pcod removal present a minimal dispersion values for a high range of influent concentrations 350 800 mg l 1 this highlights the importance of pcod removal like remarked by guven et al 2019 and to a lesser extent of scod removal the high dispersion of ccod removal values and the low weight of ccod in the total cod make this cod fraction the least important in the control of the hras process from the standpoint of energy recovery the key point is to harvest as much cod as possible guven et al 2019a nevertheless it is critical to differentiate the removal of each cod fraction given their importance in the subsequent nitrification denitrification process an increase of soluble cod in effluent hras would result in a quickly removal during the aerobic cycle thus decreasing the cod available for denitrification in the anoxic cycle regmi et al 2014 as a novelty of this study the cod fractions removal analysis has been additionally carried out in periods of six hours fig s5 shows the scod and pcod in the influent load and in the effluent for each 6 hour period together with the amount removed in periods 13h 18 h and 19h 24 h the scod and pcod load increased compared to periods 01h 06 h and 07h 12 h while the scod remained constant during the day ca 90 g h 1 the pcod removed increased with the pcod load more detailed hourly monitoring will be of interest in further development of the hras technology 3 3 effect of srt over cod removal the hras pilot plant was operated with the goal to maintain the mlss constant as process control parameter the srt 0 1 0 4 days resulting from the mlss control was correlated with cod removal efficiency to evaluate the effect of the srt on the system performance fig 7 shows the correlation between str and each cod fraction removal during the whole operation time with data divided into the different ranges of temperature conditions it can be observed that there is no correlation in any case indicating that srt value was not a determining factor in cod fractions removal at so low srt which is in agreement with the conclusions reported by rahman et al 2017 3 4 cod mass balance the cod mass balance was calculated for each experimental period in order to investigate the efficiency of the process in terms of cod sent to digestion and cod oxidized fig 8 shows the results of the mass balance for each period in general terms the oxidation was low under the values reported by haider et al 2003 12 codoxid at str 0 1 d miller et al 2017 14 codoxid at str1 d and taboada santos et al 2020 16 codoxid at str 0 9 d thus the hras working at low srt 0 2 0 05d low do 0 5 0 2 mg l 1 and the already reported high variations in the influent load permitted to send to digestion an average 55 of the influent cod with a low average oxidation of 6 9 3 6 and maintaining the codout around 40 for almost every period 3 5 bod5 removal bod5 removal follows the same pattern than cod removal presented in fig s6a the cod and bod5 removal rates were similar 57 9 and 56 10 respectively table 4 fig s6b presents the correlation between cod and bod5 removed approximately 38 of cod removed was bod5 likewise the bod5 cod ratios in the influent and effluent were the same 40 and 40 respectively indicating no variation in water degradability features overall the hras influent and effluent concentrations of cod cod fractions and bod5 for each period are presented in fig s7 as it has been noted before section 3 2 the bod5 removal efficiencies also include bod5 carbon redirection process adsorption storage and oxidation and also the bod5 carbon harvesting process settling and waste figs s6 and s7 also indicate the high scod pcod cod and bod5 removal and the buffering capacity of hras process 3 6 long term stability evaluation after analysing the average removal efficiencies of each period for the different cod fractions fig 9 and 10 show the daily evolution of codin and codout throughout all the experimental time for each cod fraction and bod5 it can be observed that the hras process did not act as a filter for scodin peak loads fig 9a as it did for pcod fig 9b since the high dispersion in scodin 171 61 mg l 1 was matched by a high dispersion in scodout 121 44 mg l 1 on the contrary of pcod fig 10b there was not a clear correlation between the inlet concentration of scod and the removal efficiency fig 10a the maximum scod removed was 140 mg l regardless of the influent concentration since similar absolute removal value was achieved at inlet concentration of 230 290 and 380 mg l thus the system presented a maximum scod removal capacity as usual of biological processes however the hras process acted as a filter for pcodin peak loads fig 9b buffering the loads to the subsequent activated sludge process even with the high dispersion in pcodin 456 200 mg l 1 the pcodout values presented a low dispersion 106 34 mg l 1 and the maximum and average values of pcod removal were 1280 and 349 198 mg l 1 respectively the almost totally parallel relationship between the pcod removal regression line and the line representing the total pcodin removal dotted line fig 10b indicates the presence of a non settling pcod that could not be removed and was independent of the pcodin concentration accordingly the hras process acted as a filter for codin peak loads fig 9c buffering the inlet loads to the subsequent activated sludge process there was a high dispersion in codin 683 214 mg l 1 that was buffered in the process with a low dispersion in codout 280 63 mg l 1 thus buffering the organic loads to the subsequent activated sludge process the maximum and average cod removal values were 1300 and 403 195 mg l 1 respectively the almost total parallel relationship between the regression line of cod removal and the line representing total codin removal dotted line fig 10c indicates that a constant amount of cod could not be removed and independently from the codin concentration this non removable cod included non settling pcod scod poly and non flocculated ccod under the pilot plant s operating conditions hence the overall cod removal efficiency was lower due to the lower scod removal efficiency in comparison with the pcod removal efficiency improvement on cod removal could only be achieved by either increasing scod oxidation with the consequent energy consumption or by improving the pcod removal associated with improved settling regarding the bod5 loading the hras process acts as a filter for bod5 in peak loads fig 9d and it buffers the organic loads to the subsequent activated sludge process the high dispersion in bod5in 253 110 mg l 1 is matched by a low dispersion in bod5out 112 59 mg l 1 the maximum and average values of bod5 removal were 600 and 154 95 mg l 1 respectively the almost total parallel relationship between the regression line of bod5 removal and the line representing total bod5 removal dotted line fig 10d indicates the presence of a bod5 that could not be removed which includes the non settling bod5 and the nonbiodegradable bod5 at short hrt increased bod5 removal could be by achieved by increasing biodegradation with the consequent energy consumption or by improving the removal of particulate bod5 which is associated with improved settling as indicated for cod overall the hras process made it possible not only to send larger amount of organic matter to anaerobic digestion 58 60 of the codin and 49 67 of the bod5in compared to the 35 40 achieved with primary clarifier crites and tchobanoglous 1998 but also to laminate the influent load to the activated sludge unit assuring its stability and reducing the size of the equipment to be installed in the unit to handle oxygen demand peaks 3 7 process simulation process simulations were carried out by means of sumo 19 software according to the model configuration detailed in the fig s1 with the goal of testing its capability to predict the removal efficiency of the different cod fractions the main parameters used in the model for the growth of ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho and a stage fast growing microorganisms aho are shown in the table s2 the cod fractions used were determined according to the average values of the pilot plant for each period the scod split and oho and aho fraction in the influent total cod were determined according to the default values of the model in comparison with full scale facilities the pilot plant has two specific characteristics low flocculation in the reactor due to wall effects and low deflocculation in the recirculation line due to the use of helicoidal pumps at low speed instead of centrifugal pumps at higher speed thus the most sensitive parameters to be adjusted were the flocculation reduction factor in the reactor Î·floc process to a value of 0 4 reactor r1 and 0 2 reactor r2 and the deflocculation factor in the recirculation line to a value of 10 the first parameter combines all hydrodynamic effects affecting the shear force on the flocs reactor geometry type of aerators and mixers that act on the residual colloids and the second parameter refers to the deflocculation factor in the recirculation line hauduc et al 2019 a reactive three compartment clarifier with a 0 9 flocculation factor in the feed well and sludge blanket was used for the settling model fig 11 presents the efficiencies obtained in the pilot plant versus the predicted with the model scod ccod and pcod removal efficiencies were closely predicted by the model as a function of their corresponding inlet concentrations with additional indication of the temperature for scodin values above 183 mg l 1 the efficiency in the pilot plant was higher than that calculated in the model and for values below 180 mg l 1 the efficiency in the model was higher than that obtained in the pilot plant fig 11a a possible explanation for this is the fact that the saturation constant for the biodegradable organic substrate ks used default constant in the model was lower than the real value as shown in fig 11b the ccod removal efficiencies were closely predicted by the model as function of the ccodin concentration however the large deviation in the experimental results of the ccod data must be considered when analysing the model outcomes finally for pcod simulation the model differs from the pilot plant results for temperatures above 23 c fig 11c which is aligned with the reduction of pcod removal efficiency observed in the pilot plant at highest temperatures fig 4b in this study the model was tested against hras a stage pilot plant operation data and proven to match the cod fraction removal efficiency future research should supplement the current study with a thorough examination of nutrient removal efficiencies in both short and long term hras processes as well as a cod balance and oxygen uptake rates conclusions reducing srt up to 0 2 days and hrt up to 0 6 h corresponding to one third of the usual values reported in hras operation allows a high redirection and harvesting of organic matter 57 9 for cod and 56 10 for bod5 with a minimum 6 9 cod oxidation the different cod fraction removal 29 12 scod 12 35 ccod and 74 10 pcod highlights the importance of settling efficiency and stability in the hras removal efficiencies maintaining the biomass concentration in the reactor at 2000 200 mg l 1 as process control strategy assured a very stable process even with the large variations in the influent so both in short and long term performance the best control parameter at very low srt to ensure the process stability and minimize cod oxidation is not strictly the srt but rather the mlss concentration the biomass concentration was directly correlated with scod and pcod removal while reactor temperature hampered the pcod removal but increased scod the direct relation between influent cod concentration and cod removal makes it advisable to use the hras process as a replacement of the pc stage and not as a downstream treatment afterward settling efficiency and stability showed a great importance in the hras performance the low svi30 values of 50 70 ml g 1 shows the exceptional biomass settling properties while the relatively low ss effluent concentration 50 120 mg l 1 indicated correct flocculation hras as process acts as a filter for the influent cod and pcod peak loads and albeit to a lesser extent for bod5 buffering the influent load to the subsequent cas process the hras as process on the other hand does not act as a filter for scod peak loads which is important regarding the likely subsequent denitrification process the simulation model adopted sumo resulted in a good fit for the scod for pcod there was a good fit except for temperatures above 23 c declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15083,membrane chemical reactors mcrs have demonstrated a great potential for simultaneous removal of wide spectrum pollutants in advanced water treatment however current catalyst re loading and catalytic reactivity limitations obstruct their practical applications herein as a proof of concept we report a hollow fiber membrane chemical reactor hf mcr with high and sustainable catalytic reactivity enabled by novel magnetic confinement engineering of the catalysts namely the zerovalent iron zvi nanocatalysts were spatially dispersed and confined to nearly parallel magnetic induction lines forming forest like microwire arrays in the membrane lumen such arrays exhibited ultrahigh hydrodynamic stability the hf mcr integrated sequential membrane separation and fenton like catalysis thus being capable of high and synergistic wide spectrum decontamination the membrane separation process completely removed large nanoplastics nps via size exclusion and thus the subsequent fenton like catalysis process enhanced removal efficiency of otherwise permeated bisphenol a bpa and phosphate p by in situ generated reactive oxygen species primarily 1o2 and iron oxyhydr oxides respectively furthermore highly dispersed zvi arrays and their continuous surface depassivation driven by magnetic gradient and hydrodynamic forces conferred abundant accessible catalytic sites i e fe0 and feii to stimulate fenton like catalysis the consequent enhancement of bpa and p removal kinetics was 3 765 and 49 492 folds those in conventional flow through or batch systems respectively periodic zvi reloading ensured sustained decontamination performance of the hf mcr this is the first demonstration of the magnetic confinement engineering that enables efficient and unlimited catalyst re loading and sustainable catalytic reactivity in the mcr for water treatment which is beyond the reach of current approaches graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane chemical reactor sustainable reactivity magnetic confinement engineering wide spectrum contaminants water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the urgent demand for safe and clean water is driving extensive research in augmenting water supplies from unconventional water sources such as wastewater he et al 2021 lyu et al 2016 shannon et al 2008 in particular ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf have become favored wastewater reclamation technologies since both can reliably produce a relatively high quality permeate at an affordable cost and with high

efficiency compared with that of two units in tandem xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 recent studies have shown both the superiority and great potential of mcr for advanced water treatment although promising current mcr applications still face critical technical challenges particularly the difficulty to achieve efficient catalyst re loading and sustainable and high catalytic reactivity he et al 2020 xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 catalyst loading methods are based on electrostatic adsorption lewis et al 2011 chemical precipitation zhang et al 2021 2020 redox reactions he et al 2020 marks et al 2019 physical coating e g by phase inversion or electrospinning qiu et al 2022 and or deposition as a film jiang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 these methods generally come with a series of complicated

al 2015 lewis et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 or even high temperature calcination zhang et al 2021 2020 such consecutive steps significantly reduce the catalyst loading efficiency furthermore available catalytic sites might be heavily shielded by themselves caused by aggregation deposition jiang et al 2015 or by the membrane polymer if they are incorporated during membrane formation e g by phase inversion or electrospinning qiu et al 2022 another major challenge is to achieve sustainable and high catalytic reactivity in general surface passivation or even destruction of the catalyst deteriorates or terminates catalytic decontamination thus inhibiting real world water treatment applications he et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 for example zerovalent iron zvi one of the most common and most promising nanomaterials in water treatment is easily deactivated by surface passivation from in situ generated precipitates at ph 3 during the activation of per oxides e g o2 and h2o2 mu et al 2017 further leaching commonly reduces the available amount of the catalyst over time particularly in a continuous single pass process diminishing reactive capacity xie et al 2021 in sum developing an efficient catalyst loading approach and sustaining high catalytic reactivity beyond the time scale of laboratory scenarios are now called upon for the ultimate adoption of mcr technology at scale here we report the initial demonstration of an integrated hollow fiber membrane chemical reactor hf mcr with sustainable and high enhanced catalytic reactivity by employing innovative magnetic confinement engineering in a hollow fiber membrane hfm one of the most popular membrane configurations applied in wastewater treatment industry figs 1 a and s1 within the core concept magnetic reactive catalytic nanomaterials are localized in a specific zone of a magnetic field where chemical reactions are allowed to occur the zvi nanoparticles are magnetically positioned and spatially dispersed in the lumen in a nearly parallel magnetic field fig 1b the hydrodynamic stability of the confined zvi nanoparticles was firstly evaluated secondly we investigated wide spectrum decontamination performance and mechanisms of the hf mcr employing sequential membrane filtration and magnetically confined enhanced fenton like catalysis figs s2 and 1b using model contaminants i e polystyrene nanoplastics nps bpa and p all frequently found in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents chen et al 2013 lyu et al 2016 lastly sustainable and high catalytic reactivity was achieved by both periodic reloading of zvi and continuous surface depassivation in all our study demonstrates not only a novel magnetic confinement strategy to achieve efficient and unlimited catalyst re loading thus sustainable and superior catalytic reactivity but also an integrated hf mcr platform for simultaneous and continuous decontamination of a complex water source 2 materials and methods 2 1 assembly of hf mcr module a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hfm manufactured by sumitomo japan 2 2 mm outer diameter 1 2 mm inner diameter 100 nm nominal pore size was selected for use this hfm has excellent mechanical strength and chemical durability e g resistance to chemical oxidation and acid base corrosion and a high water flux of 7000 l m2 h bar per our measurement a laboratory scale prototype hf mcr module was assembled with a single ptfe based hfm two syringe needle ports and several custom designed acrylic parts as illustrated in fig s2 the hf mcr module had two functional zones in a sequential configuration i e a front filtration zone and a backend catalysis zone fig s2 the filtration zone with an effective outer filtration area of Ï 2 2 mm 50 mm 345 4 mm2 was housed in a chamber with two needle inlets outlets that allowed solution to feed into the chamber in a dead end filtration mode or to be discharged from the chamber in a backwashing mode the catalysis zone is the magnetically confined zone mcz of the hfm lumen with a maximum available volume of Ï 1 2 2 mm 2 70 mm 79 1 mm3 in this zone zvi based catalytic degradation and or chemical immobilization can be initiated 2 2 loading and hydrodynamic stability of zvi nanocatalyst to load zvi details of the chemical reagents in text s1 of the supplementary materials sm the hf mcr module was inserted in a 6 mm gap in the middle of a stack of eight cylindrical permanent magnets each 50 mm in diameter made of n40 grade ndfeb figs 1a and s1a in a typical loading procedure 15 ml of the zvi suspension zvi nanospheres with an average diameter of 74 28 nm fig s3 1 g l under mechanical stirring was pumped into the hfm lumen at a flow rate of 0 75 ml min the zvi was rapidly captured and retained in the magnetically confined lumen i e the catalysis zone the zvi loading mass can be adjusted by pumping different volumes of the zvi suspension after loading the stability of the confined zvi was tested under different hydrodynamic conditions water flow velocities from 1 0 to 18 9 cm s corresponding water fluxes in the hfm ranging from 111 8 to 2099 66 l m2 h hereafter denoted as lmh the cumulative effluent was collected for 10 min and digested by 1 m hcl for total fe analysis zhong et al 2021 the percentage of zvi released indicated hydrodynamic stability 2 3 simultaneous decontamination 2 3 1 single run test unless otherwise specified all flow through experiments were performed using two peristaltic pumps longer bt100 2j baoding china with the hf mcr module mounted inside the magnetic device at room temperature as shown in figs 1a and s1b in brief 15 mg of zvi was first loaded into the catalysis zone afterward under prescribed water flux conditions from 122 3 to 476 15 lmh the feed solution initial ph 7 0 containing representative contaminants i e 5 mg l nps with an average diameter of 334 33 nm fig s4 0 5 mg l bpa and 1 mg p l po4 3 consisting of 45 h2po4 and 55 hpo4 2 fig s5 was pumped into the filtration chamber and filtered in an outside in mode the membrane permeate was then mixed with pms solution 8 mm initial ph 7 0 that was directly fed into the hfm lumen with a fixed flux ratio of 10 1 permeate to pms solution during the operation 20 ml of the effluent was sampled at each effluent volume interval of 58 l m2 the test was stopped once the p concentration in the effluent was equal to or higher than 0 5 mg p l which is the discharge limit for p from municipal wwtp in china grade i a gb 18918 2002 to analyze the bpa concentration 2 ml of subsample was taken from 20 ml of the effluent and immediately mixed with 0 05 ml of 1 m na2s2o3 solution to quench further reactions between bpa and ros as well as pms the rest of the sample was used for other analyses e g nps p and ph in addition control experiments i e f mode and c mode were conducted under the same experimental conditions specifically for f mode the same procedure was followed but the pms free solution was fed in the absence of zvi for c mode the feed solution was mixed with the pms solution and directly flowed through the lumen into the catalysis zone loaded with zvi the decontamination performance of the hf mcr was also evaluated with two realistic water samples i e wwtp effluent and river water sampled in hong kong table s1 which were subsequently spiked with the contaminants i e 5 mg l nps and 0 5 mg l bpa p was not spiked due to the existing concentrations of 1 1 1 3 mg p l solid products were collected freeze dried and stored at 4 c in the dark before characterization 2 3 2 cyclic run tests after the first run the hf mcr module was detached from the magnetic device and washed with 1 m hcl for several minutes to remove iron based residues inside the lumen followed by pump driven deionized water diw washing after that we performed ultrasonic cleaning to detach nps from the outer membrane surface and then further backwashed the filtration chamber with the pump driven diw the reconditioned hf mcr was returned to operation for another 8 runs the chemical stability of the hfm was initially evaluated by measuring f in the effluent which could be a high probability degradation product if that occurs after the last test the hf mcr was disassembled to check its structural integrity using a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem sigma 300 zeiss germany 2 4 visualization and magnetic field simulation to visualize the zvi distribution in the catalysis zone the hfm was replaced with a transparent quartz tube with equivalent geometry a high resolution microscopic camera bocheng electronics bc1800 china was employed for visual characterization the dynamic corrosion of the magnetically confined zvi by pms was recorded at water fluxes ranging from 122 3 to 476 15 lmh in addition microscopic configuration of zvi microwires embedded in epoxy resin was characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2010 jeol japan and fe sem after obtaining 100 nm thick sections using an ultramicrotome em uc7 leica germany the magnetic field acting on the module was simulated using the comsol multiphysics software package version 5 4 zhong et al 2022 the model geometry of the hf mcr system was constructed based on the actual module s configuration the maximum magnetic flux density produced by each magnet was 0 5 t and its magnetic field was oriented vertically upward the central axis of the lumen was set as the y axis of the simulation s coordinate system the origin was located at the intersection of the y axis and the z axis i e the vertical line through the magnet center figs s6 and 2c d the relative volume magnetic susceptibility and remanence of each magnet were 1 1 and 1 2 t respectively the relative volume magnetic susceptibility of zvi was calculated to be 4 9 from the measured magnetic hysteresis curve fig s7 the background of the rectangular computational domain was designated as air relative permeability 1 0 2 5 characterization and chemical analysis all spectroscopic characterization and chemical analysis procedures are described in detail in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 loading distribution and hydrodynamic stability of zvi nanocatalyst the effluent was colorless and transparent after flowing the black zvi suspension through the magnetically confined catalysis zone at a water flux of 261 lmh or a water flow velocity of 2 3 cm s fig s8 the before and after color difference indicates successful immobilization of zvi in the lumen which is further supported by non measurable fe concentration in the effluent below the detection limit of 28 Î¼g l fig 2a visual microscopic observation further showed that zvi was localized primarily in the strong mcz with a few in the weak mcz under the loading condition figs 2b and s9 it is worth noting that the distribution of zvi is highly dependent upon the water flow velocity and thus can be regulated by it that is a higher water flow velocity moves zvi further downstream from the weak mcz to the strong mcz as illustrated in figs 2b and s9 such a distribution pattern can be reasonably explained by our magnetic field simulation as indicated by the change in the magnetic force along the y axis fig 2c d see the discussion in text s3 an interesting phenomenon is that all the zvi nanoparticles were magnetized and aligned to form macroscopic microwires along the z axis figs 2e1 e2 and s10 with many interspaces between each other the zvi microwires evenly filled the cross section of the lumen i e the x z plane fig 2e2 because of the uniform magnetic field fig s6 more importantly the zvi nanoparticles did not form large compact agglomerates but rather spatially dispersed to form the microwires with lots of geometric voids figs 2e3 and s3 the formation of the forest like arrays can be attributed to the magnetic confinement as illustrated in fig 2f 1 magnetization of the zvi nanoparticles along the z axis or the magnetic induction line that creates a much enhanced magnetic attraction force 0 0042 n between two zvi nanoparticles to form the microwires fig s11 2 magnetic repulsion force between the zvi microwires in the x y plane to maintain the interspace fig s12 compared with densely packed zvi typically existing in a column our forest like arrays confer a larger exposed surface area of zvi more efficient mass transfer and a lower water channel resistance potentially contributing to more efficient catalytic decontamination under a small head loss song et al 2021 because the hydrodynamic stability of the zvi microwires in the lumen is a key prerequisite for the hf mcr process it was checked at water flow velocities ranging from 1 0 to 18 9 cm s or a water flux range of 111 8 to 2099 66 lmh fig 2a shows negligible zvi liberation the ratio of released mass to loaded mass was 0 002 when the water flow velocity was below 11 5 cm s even when the water flow velocity was increased to 18 9 cm s only 3 5 of the zvi was released into the effluent such high hydrodynamic stability can be attributed to the relatively strong inward magnetic force as a magnetic confinement force along the y axis acting on the magnetized zvi microwires fig 2c d which is much larger than that on the dispersed individual nanoparticle overall both the successful loading and high hydrodynamic stability of zvi make the hf mcr process feasible for water treatment 3 2 synergistic and enhanced decontamination in hf mcr 3 2 1 synergistic and enhanced decontamination performance we first examined the performance of filtration coupled with catalysis i e fc mode as illustrated in fig 3a in removing multiple model pollutants nps bpa and p at a high water flux of 241 3 lmh fig 3b shows that the hf mcr completely removed nps with an average diameter of 334 33 nm fig s4 via size sieving the hfm nominal pore size is 100 nm as indicated by the nps deposition on the membrane surface in fig s13 in addition 100 of the bpa was removed until the cumulative effluent volume reached 521 l m2 fig 3c when the cumulative effluent volume reached 869 l m2 bpa removal decreased to 57 due to the zvi gradual exhaustion similarly p removal remained at 100 until the cumulative effluent volume reached 637 l m2 then dropped to 58 when the cumulative effluent volume was further increased to 869 l m2 fig 3d not surprisingly our control experiments with only filtration i e f mode and only catalysis i e c mode as illustrated in fig 3a demonstrated a lower removal of the three model pollutants apart from the full nps removal by f mode particularly in the middle late stage while f mode completely removed nps the bpa removal decreased from 40 to 10 the bpa removal can be ascribed to adsorption of bpa onto the nps liu et al 2019a which were subsequently intercepted by the membrane as well as adsorbed onto the hfm negligible p removal 0 02 was observed in f mode without zvi loading fig 3d even when the hfm was loaded with unactivated zvi p removal dropped sharply from 62 to 3 in the early stage fig s14 because the limited amount of iron oxyhydr oxides produced on the zvi surface during storage captured a small amount of p only in addition within a hydraulic residence time of only 1 4 s there was negligible iron oxyhydr oxides production due to little zvi corrosion by dissolved o2 in c mode nps removal dropped from 78 to 10 as the cumulative effluent volume increased fig 3b considering the low nps removal in the presence of unactivated zvi generally below 22 fig s15 enhanced nps removal can be ascribed to co sedimentation with in situ generated iron oxyhydr oxides possibly via electrostatic attraction and or complexation li et al 2019 such co sedimentation is further confirmed by the iron oxyhydr oxides coating on the nps surface as shown in the fe sem and hr tem images figs s16 and s17 in the early middle stage a thicker coating of the iron oxyhydr oxides on the nps surface was observed as the cumulative effluent volume increased fig s17 afterward however the iron oxyhydr oxides coating on the nps surface decreased or even disappeared due to zvi exhaustion fig s16c d accordingly poor nps removal was also observed fig 3b in c mode bpa and p were completely removed in the early middle stage with the loss of active catalytic sites i e fe0 and feii toward pms activation fig s18 see more discussion in text s4 their removal finally dropped to 32 and 53 it is noteworthy that there is a lower removal of nps bpa and p in c mode particularly in the middle late stage compared with that in fc mode nps with abundant functional groups e g oxygen containing groups as shown in the ftir spectra of fig s19 can scavenge in situ generated ros e g 1o2 so4 and oh and thus impede the bpa degradation zhu et al 2020 in turn nps attacked by ros can further create competitive sites e g oxygen containing groups that can bind with iron oxyhydr oxides lang et al 2020 thus deteriorating the p removal among the three modes at a cumulative effluent volume of 752 l m2 bpa and p removal 79 and 86 respectively in fc mode are impressively higher than the sum of their separate removal in the two other modes 65 and 63 this comparison suggests that the sequential filtration and reactions synergistically remove bpa and p benefiting from the full nps removal in advance similar to the enhancement enabled by advance removal of nom in mcr as reported earlier minella et al 2018 xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 fig 3e shows that the hf mcr in fc mode exhibited a stable water flux of 241 3 lmh throughout the test close to that in f or c mode this finding indicates not only that the forest like arrays formed by magnetically confined zvi in the lumen cause little water channel resistance but also that hfm fouling is negligible possibly because of poor interaction between the ptfe based hfm and nps the above results together highlight the utilization and synergy of multiple decontamination mechanisms in achieving a high performance hf mcr 3 2 2 enhanced pms activation and decontamination mechanisms pms activation by zvi has been extensively reported to follow a classical electron transfer mechanism involving fe2 production and oxidation fu et al 2020 wang et al 2020b 2020c a magnetic field boosts zvi corrosion via directional movement of paramagnetic fe2 primarily by magnetic gradient forces thereby improving pms activation to produce ros and iron oxyhydr oxides fu et al 2020 liang et al 2014 wang et al 2020b in line with previous studies fu et al 2020 liu et al 2019b here enhanced production of ros particularly oh and 1o2 was observed in the magnetic field fig 4a see ros generation pathways in text s5 this concomitantly favored higher and faster bpa degradation and p removal in the hf mcr fig 4b2 b3 a magnetic field simulation revealed that fe2 was prone to directionally migrate along the zvi nanosphere surface to its magnetic poles i e physical contact points between the zvi nanospheres e g sites a c and e in fig 4c driven by the increasing magnetic gradient forces figs 4d and s20 furthermore contact between the zvi nanospheres can greatly enhance the fe2 movement as indicated by the much larger magnetic gradient forces around the contact points this enhancement will cause an uneven distribution of fe2 and thus ultimately localized accumulations of iron oxyhydr oxide films near the contact points nevertheless hydrodynamic force acting on fe2 and iron oxyhydr oxides can alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation thereby sustaining the pms activation fig 5 more importantly magnetically confined zvi microwires exhibited a reciprocating movement in the lumen fig 4e in this regard we attribute it to imbalanced force acting on them induced by the perturbed hydrodynamic force that can come from a pump driven or high water flow and inward magnetic forces along the y axis the microwires movement was further strengthened and accelerated when the cumulative effluent volume increased due to weakened magnetic forces along the y axis acting on the corroded zvi microwires zvi has a higher magnetic susceptibility or a stronger magnetic response than the produced iron oxyhyr oxides the dynamic movement favors the continuous production of ros and iron oxyhydr oxides by enhancing mass transfer between zvi and pms and constantly depassivating and exposing fresh zvi to pms thus each zvi nanosphere experiences boosted corrosion near its magnetic poles as implied by the dissolution of the zvi microwires by hcl fig s21a b in principle the zvi microwires in the x y plane have equal opportunities to activate pms for the production of ros and iron oxyhydr oxides to remove bpa and p which can be further evidenced by the spatially uniform decolorization of rhodamine b in the hf mcr fig s21c such repeated corrosion eventually resulted in shorter and thinner zvi microwires or even their disappearance fig 5d but no zvi liberation occurred in the effluent fig s22 to highlight the superior performance of the hf mcr we compared the bpa and p removal in six zvi pms treatment systems group i a combination of flow through water and a nearly parallel magnetic field the configuration in this study group ii a combination of flow through water and a non parallel magnetic field group iii flow through water only group iv a combination of stirred water and a non parallel magnetic field group v a non parallel magnetic field only and group vi stirred water only fig 4b1 as shown in fig 4b2 3 there was higher and faster bpa and p removal in the hf mcr group i than in the other five systems group ii vi showed lower and more stagnant removal of bpa and p due to surface passivation and slower mass transfer within 75 min more specifically the first order reaction rates k obs bpa and k obs p were determined to be 0 0765 and 1 4762 min 1 in group i which were 3 765 and 49 492 folds those in the conventional systems k obs bpa 0 0001 0 0245 min 1 k obs p 0 0030 0 0302 min 1 fig 4b3 respectively this comparison demonstrates the enhanced sustained pms activation in the hf mcr which results from enhanced mass transfer and continuous exposure of active sites to pms fig 4f shows that with the addition of 100 mm methanol meoh or tert butyl alcohol tba as both oh and so4 scavenger and only oh scavenger second rate constant k oh meoh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 meoh 1 6 7 8 107 m 1 s 1 k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 kso4 tba 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020a the bpa degradation decreased from 100 to 81 and 86 within 60 min respectively also the corresponding first order reaction rates declined from 0 0765 ck to 0 0302 w meoh 0 0318 w tba respectively the ros quenching experiments suggest minor contributions of oh and so4 to the bpa degradation we further checked role of 1o2 in the bpa degradation interestingly the bpa degradation dramatically dropped to 17 after the introduction of 10 mm furfuryl alcohol ffa as a 1o2 scavenger second rate constant k 1o2 ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020a the corresponding reaction rates dramatically dropped to 0 0090 min 1 w ffa it is worth noting that ffa can directly react with pms but the catalytic activation of pms by the zvi in the presence of ffa still occurred because the decomposition rate of pms in the zvi pms ffa system was 14 6 fold that in the pms ffa system fig s23 furthermore the pms decomposition rate in the zvi pms system was 5 1 fold that in the pms ffa system although ffa can also directly react with oh and so4 lee et al 2020 wu and kim 2022 both oh and so4 play minor roles in the bpa degradation as verified earlier thus the ffa quenching experiment result indeed suggests the primary role of 1o2 in the bpa degradation in the hf mcr the contributions of other ros such as o2 may be negligible due to their low reduction potentials e g e0 o2 o2 0 33 vnhe short lifetimes and or slow oxidation rates wu et al 2022 to sum up 1o2 dominantly accounts for the bpa degradation and radical processes occur to understand possible bpa degradation pathways we identified intermediate products of bpa degradation using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uplc ms as shown in fig s24 we detected eight degradation intermediates with benzene ring s which were typically found in singlet oxygen dominated bpa oxidation processes via persulfate activation bu et al 2021 hu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 you et al 2021 this indicates that the bpa degradation in the hf mcr may share the similar same degradation pathways as those in previous studies fig s24 it is worth noting that the hf mcr has a hydraulic residence time of only a few seconds reaction time much shorter than those of batch reaction systems several minutes to hours therefore bpa in the hf mcr might undergo a low degree of mineralization particularly in the late stage of the reaction when zvi is mostly exhausted the enhanced pms activation by zvi boosted the generation of needle and cloud like iron oxyhydr oxides likely corresponding to goethite lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite respectively figs 4g and s25 zhong et al 2021 this observation is similar to previous findings in a zvi per oxides system fu et al 2020 he et al 2016 liang et al 2014 these minerals accounted for the p removal via adsorption and or precipitation nagoya et al 2019 as indicated by the elemental overlapping of fe p and o fig 4h recently guan et al found that coexisting anions such as so4 2 and cl promoted zvi corrosion and thus as iii removal in a weak magnetic field sun et al 2017 they further proposed the simultaneous movement of the anions e g so4 2 with the paramagnetic fe2 in order to maintain local electroneutrality in solution in our hf mcr a considerable amount of so4 2 concentrations up to 139 6 mg l produced from pms as well as phosphate fig s5 likely promoted pms activation by similarly accelerating the zvi corrosion hence the ros and iron oxyhydr oxides production in the hf mcr was further enhanced in turn accounting for the enhanced bpa and p removal 3 3 water flux mediated decontamination we investigated the effect of water flux on the removal of the three contaminants using flows ranging from 122 2 to 476 15 lmh corresponding to hydraulic residence times from 2 7 to 0 7 s fig 5a shows that size sieving maintained nps removal at 100 in contrast when the water flux was increased from 122 2 to 476 15 lmh bpa removal first increased and then decreased particularly in the middle late stage fig 5b unlike the bpa removal p removal followed a monotonically inverse relationship with the water flux fig 5c these results suggest water flux mediated decontamination behaviors the dynamics of the zvi corrosion were visualized to elucidate the water flux induced differences in bpa and p removal fig 5d shows that black zvi microwires were corroded by pms more slowly in the early stage when the water flux was increased from 122 2 to 241 3 lmh as indicated by the lesser and slower growth of brown swelled iron oxyhydr oxides film on their surface the result of larger hydrodynamic force and a shorter hydraulic residence time we observed less pms decomposition by zvi and a higher effluent ph in this stage when the water flux was increased from 122 2 to 241 3 lmh fig s26 this observation further supports slower zvi oxidative corrosion by pms at a higher water flux in the early stage at both water fluxes there was sufficient production of ros and iron oxyhyr oxides to maintain full bpa and p removal in this stage which is in accordance with our earlier observation fig 5b c as the tests proceeded we observed further growth of the iron oxyhydr oxides film on the surface of the zvi microwires at a water flux of 122 2 lmh this passivation film significantly impeded pms activation by the fresh zvi core as reflected by the effluent ph increasing from 3 0 to 3 8 fig s26b benefiting from a higher water flux or larger hydrodynamic force the zvi microwires exhibited a strengthened and accelerated reciprocating movement at the water flux of 241 3 lmh thus forming a considerably smaller and thinner iron oxyhydr oxides film that allowed continuous exposure of fresh iron core to pms this condition favors continuous activation of pms by the zvi microwires as further confirmed by a stable and low effluent ph 3 2 3 5 fig s26b as a result higher bpa removal by ros at a higher water flux was achieved over the course of the whole test and p removal by iron oxyhydr oxides was favored importantly a higher water flux increased the utilization efficiency of the zvi microwires because the higher depassivation exposed more zvi to pms as demonstrated by more thorough corrosion by pms fig 5d however when we further increased the water flux to 476 15 lmh the ros and iron oxyhydr oxides production was significantly reduced due to the very limited hydraulic residence time of 0 7 s fig 5d as indicated by a higher effluent ph 3 8 4 2 accordingly the amounts of both ros and iron oxyhydr oxides were not sufficient to maintain satisfactory decontamination performance and we observed rather low bpa and p removal fig 5d in addition we observed negligible water flux change over the entire course of the operation fig s27 which we ascribed to negligible membrane fouling by nps meanwhile there was no observable zvi in the effluent fig s22 which is attributed to strong magnetic confinement of zvi in summary the water flux affects not only the contact time between the zvi microwires and pms but also the surface depassivation or reactivity of the zvi microwires collectively determining the production of ros and iron oxyhydr oxides for the respective removal of bpa and p in this work an intermediate water flux of 241 3 lmh was thus found favorable for simultaneous decontamination 3 4 sustainable reactivity and decontamination of hf mcr with periodic zvi reloading while the hf mcr can maintain high reactivity toward pms activation by continuous depassivation the loaded zvi is inevitably exhausted and can no longer provide satisfactory bpa and p removal to renew reactivity catalysts are generally reloaded into a mcr so we experimentally performed a 9 cycle run of the hf mcr with periodic membrane washing and zvi reloading fig 6a b shows that nps removal remained at 100 over the course of each test and the water flux remained stable 241 lmh these observations indicate that the hf mcr preserves its membrane pore integrity over the 9 cycle operation without incurring any observable structural damage by pms attack and or ultrasonication to wash the membrane as shown in the fe sem images fig s28 furthermore f release from the ptfe based hfm remained below the recommended drinking water limit 1 mg l in china fig 6c this low level is the result of not only the relatively inert nature of the ptfe material but also the spatial configuration of the hf mcr the front filtration zone and backend catalysis zone fully protected the membrane structure of the filtration zone from being attacked by strongly oxidizing ros particularly so4 and oh in each of the 9 runs the bpa and p removal decreased gradually from 100 to 53 and 59 respectively fig 6a indicating a stable and high decontamination performance over the 9 cycle run impressively the hf mcr treated 7820 l m2 of contaminated water within 35 h and can continue to run without any tangible structural damage in summary our hf mcr platform using magnetically confined catalyst re loading offers high sustainable catalytic reactivity for decontamination its performance is far superior to that of many other reported mcrs which suffer from catalyst depletion and cannot be reloaded lotfi et al 2022 qiu et al 2022 xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 4 outlook for future development our hf mcr is capable of simultaneously removing nps bpa and p in a wide ph range of 3 0 9 0 and exhibits higher bpa and p removal in acidic wastewater fig s29 more discussion in text s6 this reactor has also been successfully applied in the treatment of realistic water samples including wwtp effluent and river water figs s30 and s31 more discussion in text s7 the results demonstrate its great potential in water treatment importantly the hf mcr platform is highly tunable and its sieving capability catalytic reactivity durability and other aspects can be optimized for example we can regulate the key parameters such as extending the hydraulic residence time and increasing zvi mass to improve the catalytic performance using a hollow ceramic membrane instead of a polymeric one can provide a longer service life in years while significantly lowering environmental risks caused by release of degradation products besides these other catalytic reaction schemes such as redox reactions and adsorption can be developed to capitalize on the confinement of magnetic nanomaterials composites such as fe3o4 these modifications could significantly extend applicability of the hf mcr technology to advanced waste water treatment targeting in one go such multiple pollutants as trace antibiotics roxarsone metal loids suspended particulates and pathogenic bacteria we envision modular hollow ceramic membrane based hf mcr for example with an enlarged filtration zone and an enlarged reactive zone which is also equipped with automatic re loading process this will promote further development and scale up of the module for small scale and industrial applications 5 conclusion developing a mcr platform that achieves efficient catalyst re loading and sustainable and high catalytic reactivity is of great significance for simultaneous removal of wide spectrum pollutants in complex water in this work we have shown the initial demonstration of a novel magnetic confinement approach to re loading a magnetic nanomaterial zvi and sustaining its high catalytic reactivity in the ample lumen space of a hfm the hf mcr simultaneously and efficiently removes wide spectrum contaminants in a complex water matrix with geometric sizes ranging from subnanometer to several hundred nanometers the front membrane separation process fully removed large nps via size exclusion whereas the following fenton like catalysis process enhanced removal of permeated bpa and p by in situ generated ros primarily 1o2 and iron oxyhydr oxides respectively our study further revealed the unique roles of the magnetic confinement of the catalysts in synergistic and enhanced decontamination efficiently re loading magnetic ultra stabilization under harsh hydrodynamic conditions much improved spatial dispersion and continuously boosted surface depassivation of the zvi lastly we showed that periodic zvi reloading endowed sustainable and high reactivity and lasting decontamination performance of the hf mcr taken together it can be expected that our approach

15083,membrane chemical reactors mcrs have demonstrated a great potential for simultaneous removal of wide spectrum pollutants in advanced water treatment however current catalyst re loading and catalytic reactivity limitations obstruct their practical applications herein as a proof of concept we report a hollow fiber membrane chemical reactor hf mcr with high and sustainable catalytic reactivity enabled by novel magnetic confinement engineering of the catalysts namely the zerovalent iron zvi nanocatalysts were spatially dispersed and confined to nearly parallel magnetic induction lines forming forest like microwire arrays in the membrane lumen such arrays exhibited ultrahigh hydrodynamic stability the hf mcr integrated sequential membrane separation and fenton like catalysis thus being capable of high and synergistic wide spectrum decontamination the membrane separation process completely removed large nanoplastics nps via size exclusion and thus the subsequent fenton like catalysis process enhanced removal efficiency of otherwise permeated bisphenol a bpa and phosphate p by in situ generated reactive oxygen species primarily 1o2 and iron oxyhydr oxides respectively furthermore highly dispersed zvi arrays and their continuous surface depassivation driven by magnetic gradient and hydrodynamic forces conferred abundant accessible catalytic sites i e fe0 and feii to stimulate fenton like catalysis the consequent enhancement of bpa and p removal kinetics was 3 765 and 49 492 folds those in conventional flow through or batch systems respectively periodic zvi reloading ensured sustained decontamination performance of the hf mcr this is the first demonstration of the magnetic confinement engineering that enables efficient and unlimited catalyst re loading and sustainable catalytic reactivity in the mcr for water treatment which is beyond the reach of current approaches graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane chemical reactor sustainable reactivity magnetic confinement engineering wide spectrum contaminants water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the urgent demand for safe and clean water is driving extensive research in augmenting water supplies from unconventional water sources such as wastewater he et al 2021 lyu et al 2016 shannon et al 2008 in particular ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf have become favored wastewater reclamation technologies since both can reliably produce a relatively high quality permeate at an affordable cost and with high

efficiency compared with that of two units in tandem xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 recent studies have shown both the superiority and great potential of mcr for advanced water treatment although promising current mcr applications still face critical technical challenges particularly the difficulty to achieve efficient catalyst re loading and sustainable and high catalytic reactivity he et al 2020 xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 catalyst loading methods are based on electrostatic adsorption lewis et al 2011 chemical precipitation zhang et al 2021 2020 redox reactions he et al 2020 marks et al 2019 physical coating e g by phase inversion or electrospinning qiu et al 2022 and or deposition as a film jiang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 these methods generally come with a series of complicated

al 2015 lewis et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 or even high temperature calcination zhang et al 2021 2020 such consecutive steps significantly reduce the catalyst loading efficiency furthermore available catalytic sites might be heavily shielded by themselves caused by aggregation deposition jiang et al 2015 or by the membrane polymer if they are incorporated during membrane formation e g by phase inversion or electrospinning qiu et al 2022 another major challenge is to achieve sustainable and high catalytic reactivity in general surface passivation or even destruction of the catalyst deteriorates or terminates catalytic decontamination thus inhibiting real world water treatment applications he et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 for example zerovalent iron zvi one of the most common and most promising nanomaterials in water treatment is easily deactivated by surface passivation from in situ generated precipitates at ph 3 during the activation of per oxides e g o2 and h2o2 mu et al 2017 further leaching commonly reduces the available amount of the catalyst over time particularly in a continuous single pass process diminishing reactive capacity xie et al 2021 in sum developing an efficient catalyst loading approach and sustaining high catalytic reactivity beyond the time scale of laboratory scenarios are now called upon for the ultimate adoption of mcr technology at scale here we report the initial demonstration of an integrated hollow fiber membrane chemical reactor hf mcr with sustainable and high enhanced catalytic reactivity by employing innovative magnetic confinement engineering in a hollow fiber membrane hfm one of the most popular membrane configurations applied in wastewater treatment industry figs 1 a and s1 within the core concept magnetic reactive catalytic nanomaterials are localized in a specific zone of a magnetic field where chemical reactions are allowed to occur the zvi nanoparticles are magnetically positioned and spatially dispersed in the lumen in a nearly parallel magnetic field fig 1b the hydrodynamic stability of the confined zvi nanoparticles was firstly evaluated secondly we investigated wide spectrum decontamination performance and mechanisms of the hf mcr employing sequential membrane filtration and magnetically confined enhanced fenton like catalysis figs s2 and 1b using model contaminants i e polystyrene nanoplastics nps bpa and p all frequently found in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents chen et al 2013 lyu et al 2016 lastly sustainable and high catalytic reactivity was achieved by both periodic reloading of zvi and continuous surface depassivation in all our study demonstrates not only a novel magnetic confinement strategy to achieve efficient and unlimited catalyst re loading thus sustainable and superior catalytic reactivity but also an integrated hf mcr platform for simultaneous and continuous decontamination of a complex water source 2 materials and methods 2 1 assembly of hf mcr module a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hfm manufactured by sumitomo japan 2 2 mm outer diameter 1 2 mm inner diameter 100 nm nominal pore size was selected for use this hfm has excellent mechanical strength and chemical durability e g resistance to chemical oxidation and acid base corrosion and a high water flux of 7000 l m2 h bar per our measurement a laboratory scale prototype hf mcr module was assembled with a single ptfe based hfm two syringe needle ports and several custom designed acrylic parts as illustrated in fig s2 the hf mcr module had two functional zones in a sequential configuration i e a front filtration zone and a backend catalysis zone fig s2 the filtration zone with an effective outer filtration area of Ï 2 2 mm 50 mm 345 4 mm2 was housed in a chamber with two needle inlets outlets that allowed solution to feed into the chamber in a dead end filtration mode or to be discharged from the chamber in a backwashing mode the catalysis zone is the magnetically confined zone mcz of the hfm lumen with a maximum available volume of Ï 1 2 2 mm 2 70 mm 79 1 mm3 in this zone zvi based catalytic degradation and or chemical immobilization can be initiated 2 2 loading and hydrodynamic stability of zvi nanocatalyst to load zvi details of the chemical reagents in text s1 of the supplementary materials sm the hf mcr module was inserted in a 6 mm gap in the middle of a stack of eight cylindrical permanent magnets each 50 mm in diameter made of n40 grade ndfeb figs 1a and s1a in a typical loading procedure 15 ml of the zvi suspension zvi nanospheres with an average diameter of 74 28 nm fig s3 1 g l under mechanical stirring was pumped into the hfm lumen at a flow rate of 0 75 ml min the zvi was rapidly captured and retained in the magnetically confined lumen i e the catalysis zone the zvi loading mass can be adjusted by pumping different volumes of the zvi suspension after loading the stability of the confined zvi was tested under different hydrodynamic conditions water flow velocities from 1 0 to 18 9 cm s corresponding water fluxes in the hfm ranging from 111 8 to 2099 66 l m2 h hereafter denoted as lmh the cumulative effluent was collected for 10 min and digested by 1 m hcl for total fe analysis zhong et al 2021 the percentage of zvi released indicated hydrodynamic stability 2 3 simultaneous decontamination 2 3 1 single run test unless otherwise specified all flow through experiments were performed using two peristaltic pumps longer bt100 2j baoding china with the hf mcr module mounted inside the magnetic device at room temperature as shown in figs 1a and s1b in brief 15 mg of zvi was first loaded into the catalysis zone afterward under prescribed water flux conditions from 122 3 to 476 15 lmh the feed solution initial ph 7 0 containing representative contaminants i e 5 mg l nps with an average diameter of 334 33 nm fig s4 0 5 mg l bpa and 1 mg p l po4 3 consisting of 45 h2po4 and 55 hpo4 2 fig s5 was pumped into the filtration chamber and filtered in an outside in mode the membrane permeate was then mixed with pms solution 8 mm initial ph 7 0 that was directly fed into the hfm lumen with a fixed flux ratio of 10 1 permeate to pms solution during the operation 20 ml of the effluent was sampled at each effluent volume interval of 58 l m2 the test was stopped once the p concentration in the effluent was equal to or higher than 0 5 mg p l which is the discharge limit for p from municipal wwtp in china grade i a gb 18918 2002 to analyze the bpa concentration 2 ml of subsample was taken from 20 ml of the effluent and immediately mixed with 0 05 ml of 1 m na2s2o3 solution to quench further reactions between bpa and ros as well as pms the rest of the sample was used for other analyses e g nps p and ph in addition control experiments i e f mode and c mode were conducted under the same experimental conditions specifically for f mode the same procedure was followed but the pms free solution was fed in the absence of zvi for c mode the feed solution was mixed with the pms solution and directly flowed through the lumen into the catalysis zone loaded with zvi the decontamination performance of the hf mcr was also evaluated with two realistic water samples i e wwtp effluent and river water sampled in hong kong table s1 which were subsequently spiked with the contaminants i e 5 mg l nps and 0 5 mg l bpa p was not spiked due to the existing concentrations of 1 1 1 3 mg p l solid products were collected freeze dried and stored at 4 c in the dark before characterization 2 3 2 cyclic run tests after the first run the hf mcr module was detached from the magnetic device and washed with 1 m hcl for several minutes to remove iron based residues inside the lumen followed by pump driven deionized water diw washing after that we performed ultrasonic cleaning to detach nps from the outer membrane surface and then further backwashed the filtration chamber with the pump driven diw the reconditioned hf mcr was returned to operation for another 8 runs the chemical stability of the hfm was initially evaluated by measuring f in the effluent which could be a high probability degradation product if that occurs after the last test the hf mcr was disassembled to check its structural integrity using a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem sigma 300 zeiss germany 2 4 visualization and magnetic field simulation to visualize the zvi distribution in the catalysis zone the hfm was replaced with a transparent quartz tube with equivalent geometry a high resolution microscopic camera bocheng electronics bc1800 china was employed for visual characterization the dynamic corrosion of the magnetically confined zvi by pms was recorded at water fluxes ranging from 122 3 to 476 15 lmh in addition microscopic configuration of zvi microwires embedded in epoxy resin was characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2010 jeol japan and fe sem after obtaining 100 nm thick sections using an ultramicrotome em uc7 leica germany the magnetic field acting on the module was simulated using the comsol multiphysics software package version 5 4 zhong et al 2022 the model geometry of the hf mcr system was constructed based on the actual module s configuration the maximum magnetic flux density produced by each magnet was 0 5 t and its magnetic field was oriented vertically upward the central axis of the lumen was set as the y axis of the simulation s coordinate system the origin was located at the intersection of the y axis and the z axis i e the vertical line through the magnet center figs s6 and 2c d the relative volume magnetic susceptibility and remanence of each magnet were 1 1 and 1 2 t respectively the relative volume magnetic susceptibility of zvi was calculated to be 4 9 from the measured magnetic hysteresis curve fig s7 the background of the rectangular computational domain was designated as air relative permeability 1 0 2 5 characterization and chemical analysis all spectroscopic characterization and chemical analysis procedures are described in detail in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 loading distribution and hydrodynamic stability of zvi nanocatalyst the effluent was colorless and transparent after flowing the black zvi suspension through the magnetically confined catalysis zone at a water flux of 261 lmh or a water flow velocity of 2 3 cm s fig s8 the before and after color difference indicates successful immobilization of zvi in the lumen which is further supported by non measurable fe concentration in the effluent below the detection limit of 28 Î¼g l fig 2a visual microscopic observation further showed that zvi was localized primarily in the strong mcz with a few in the weak mcz under the loading condition figs 2b and s9 it is worth noting that the distribution of zvi is highly dependent upon the water flow velocity and thus can be regulated by it that is a higher water flow velocity moves zvi further downstream from the weak mcz to the strong mcz as illustrated in figs 2b and s9 such a distribution pattern can be reasonably explained by our magnetic field simulation as indicated by the change in the magnetic force along the y axis fig 2c d see the discussion in text s3 an interesting phenomenon is that all the zvi nanoparticles were magnetized and aligned to form macroscopic microwires along the z axis figs 2e1 e2 and s10 with many interspaces between each other the zvi microwires evenly filled the cross section of the lumen i e the x z plane fig 2e2 because of the uniform magnetic field fig s6 more importantly the zvi nanoparticles did not form large compact agglomerates but rather spatially dispersed to form the microwires with lots of geometric voids figs 2e3 and s3 the formation of the forest like arrays can be attributed to the magnetic confinement as illustrated in fig 2f 1 magnetization of the zvi nanoparticles along the z axis or the magnetic induction line that creates a much enhanced magnetic attraction force 0 0042 n between two zvi nanoparticles to form the microwires fig s11 2 magnetic repulsion force between the zvi microwires in the x y plane to maintain the interspace fig s12 compared with densely packed zvi typically existing in a column our forest like arrays confer a larger exposed surface area of zvi more efficient mass transfer and a lower water channel resistance potentially contributing to more efficient catalytic decontamination under a small head loss song et al 2021 because the hydrodynamic stability of the zvi microwires in the lumen is a key prerequisite for the hf mcr process it was checked at water flow velocities ranging from 1 0 to 18 9 cm s or a water flux range of 111 8 to 2099 66 lmh fig 2a shows negligible zvi liberation the ratio of released mass to loaded mass was 0 002 when the water flow velocity was below 11 5 cm s even when the water flow velocity was increased to 18 9 cm s only 3 5 of the zvi was released into the effluent such high hydrodynamic stability can be attributed to the relatively strong inward magnetic force as a magnetic confinement force along the y axis acting on the magnetized zvi microwires fig 2c d which is much larger than that on the dispersed individual nanoparticle overall both the successful loading and high hydrodynamic stability of zvi make the hf mcr process feasible for water treatment 3 2 synergistic and enhanced decontamination in hf mcr 3 2 1 synergistic and enhanced decontamination performance we first examined the performance of filtration coupled with catalysis i e fc mode as illustrated in fig 3a in removing multiple model pollutants nps bpa and p at a high water flux of 241 3 lmh fig 3b shows that the hf mcr completely removed nps with an average diameter of 334 33 nm fig s4 via size sieving the hfm nominal pore size is 100 nm as indicated by the nps deposition on the membrane surface in fig s13 in addition 100 of the bpa was removed until the cumulative effluent volume reached 521 l m2 fig 3c when the cumulative effluent volume reached 869 l m2 bpa removal decreased to 57 due to the zvi gradual exhaustion similarly p removal remained at 100 until the cumulative effluent volume reached 637 l m2 then dropped to 58 when the cumulative effluent volume was further increased to 869 l m2 fig 3d not surprisingly our control experiments with only filtration i e f mode and only catalysis i e c mode as illustrated in fig 3a demonstrated a lower removal of the three model pollutants apart from the full nps removal by f mode particularly in the middle late stage while f mode completely removed nps the bpa removal decreased from 40 to 10 the bpa removal can be ascribed to adsorption of bpa onto the nps liu et al 2019a which were subsequently intercepted by the membrane as well as adsorbed onto the hfm negligible p removal 0 02 was observed in f mode without zvi loading fig 3d even when the hfm was loaded with unactivated zvi p removal dropped sharply from 62 to 3 in the early stage fig s14 because the limited amount of iron oxyhydr oxides produced on the zvi surface during storage captured a small amount of p only in addition within a hydraulic residence time of only 1 4 s there was negligible iron oxyhydr oxides production due to little zvi corrosion by dissolved o2 in c mode nps removal dropped from 78 to 10 as the cumulative effluent volume increased fig 3b considering the low nps removal in the presence of unactivated zvi generally below 22 fig s15 enhanced nps removal can be ascribed to co sedimentation with in situ generated iron oxyhydr oxides possibly via electrostatic attraction and or complexation li et al 2019 such co sedimentation is further confirmed by the iron oxyhydr oxides coating on the nps surface as shown in the fe sem and hr tem images figs s16 and s17 in the early middle stage a thicker coating of the iron oxyhydr oxides on the nps surface was observed as the cumulative effluent volume increased fig s17 afterward however the iron oxyhydr oxides coating on the nps surface decreased or even disappeared due to zvi exhaustion fig s16c d accordingly poor nps removal was also observed fig 3b in c mode bpa and p were completely removed in the early middle stage with the loss of active catalytic sites i e fe0 and feii toward pms activation fig s18 see more discussion in text s4 their removal finally dropped to 32 and 53 it is noteworthy that there is a lower removal of nps bpa and p in c mode particularly in the middle late stage compared with that in fc mode nps with abundant functional groups e g oxygen containing groups as shown in the ftir spectra of fig s19 can scavenge in situ generated ros e g 1o2 so4 and oh and thus impede the bpa degradation zhu et al 2020 in turn nps attacked by ros can further create competitive sites e g oxygen containing groups that can bind with iron oxyhydr oxides lang et al 2020 thus deteriorating the p removal among the three modes at a cumulative effluent volume of 752 l m2 bpa and p removal 79 and 86 respectively in fc mode are impressively higher than the sum of their separate removal in the two other modes 65 and 63 this comparison suggests that the sequential filtration and reactions synergistically remove bpa and p benefiting from the full nps removal in advance similar to the enhancement enabled by advance removal of nom in mcr as reported earlier minella et al 2018 xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 fig 3e shows that the hf mcr in fc mode exhibited a stable water flux of 241 3 lmh throughout the test close to that in f or c mode this finding indicates not only that the forest like arrays formed by magnetically confined zvi in the lumen cause little water channel resistance but also that hfm fouling is negligible possibly because of poor interaction between the ptfe based hfm and nps the above results together highlight the utilization and synergy of multiple decontamination mechanisms in achieving a high performance hf mcr 3 2 2 enhanced pms activation and decontamination mechanisms pms activation by zvi has been extensively reported to follow a classical electron transfer mechanism involving fe2 production and oxidation fu et al 2020 wang et al 2020b 2020c a magnetic field boosts zvi corrosion via directional movement of paramagnetic fe2 primarily by magnetic gradient forces thereby improving pms activation to produce ros and iron oxyhydr oxides fu et al 2020 liang et al 2014 wang et al 2020b in line with previous studies fu et al 2020 liu et al 2019b here enhanced production of ros particularly oh and 1o2 was observed in the magnetic field fig 4a see ros generation pathways in text s5 this concomitantly favored higher and faster bpa degradation and p removal in the hf mcr fig 4b2 b3 a magnetic field simulation revealed that fe2 was prone to directionally migrate along the zvi nanosphere surface to its magnetic poles i e physical contact points between the zvi nanospheres e g sites a c and e in fig 4c driven by the increasing magnetic gradient forces figs 4d and s20 furthermore contact between the zvi nanospheres can greatly enhance the fe2 movement as indicated by the much larger magnetic gradient forces around the contact points this enhancement will cause an uneven distribution of fe2 and thus ultimately localized accumulations of iron oxyhydr oxide films near the contact points nevertheless hydrodynamic force acting on fe2 and iron oxyhydr oxides can alleviate or even eliminate the accumulation thereby sustaining the pms activation fig 5 more importantly magnetically confined zvi microwires exhibited a reciprocating movement in the lumen fig 4e in this regard we attribute it to imbalanced force acting on them induced by the perturbed hydrodynamic force that can come from a pump driven or high water flow and inward magnetic forces along the y axis the microwires movement was further strengthened and accelerated when the cumulative effluent volume increased due to weakened magnetic forces along the y axis acting on the corroded zvi microwires zvi has a higher magnetic susceptibility or a stronger magnetic response than the produced iron oxyhyr oxides the dynamic movement favors the continuous production of ros and iron oxyhydr oxides by enhancing mass transfer between zvi and pms and constantly depassivating and exposing fresh zvi to pms thus each zvi nanosphere experiences boosted corrosion near its magnetic poles as implied by the dissolution of the zvi microwires by hcl fig s21a b in principle the zvi microwires in the x y plane have equal opportunities to activate pms for the production of ros and iron oxyhydr oxides to remove bpa and p which can be further evidenced by the spatially uniform decolorization of rhodamine b in the hf mcr fig s21c such repeated corrosion eventually resulted in shorter and thinner zvi microwires or even their disappearance fig 5d but no zvi liberation occurred in the effluent fig s22 to highlight the superior performance of the hf mcr we compared the bpa and p removal in six zvi pms treatment systems group i a combination of flow through water and a nearly parallel magnetic field the configuration in this study group ii a combination of flow through water and a non parallel magnetic field group iii flow through water only group iv a combination of stirred water and a non parallel magnetic field group v a non parallel magnetic field only and group vi stirred water only fig 4b1 as shown in fig 4b2 3 there was higher and faster bpa and p removal in the hf mcr group i than in the other five systems group ii vi showed lower and more stagnant removal of bpa and p due to surface passivation and slower mass transfer within 75 min more specifically the first order reaction rates k obs bpa and k obs p were determined to be 0 0765 and 1 4762 min 1 in group i which were 3 765 and 49 492 folds those in the conventional systems k obs bpa 0 0001 0 0245 min 1 k obs p 0 0030 0 0302 min 1 fig 4b3 respectively this comparison demonstrates the enhanced sustained pms activation in the hf mcr which results from enhanced mass transfer and continuous exposure of active sites to pms fig 4f shows that with the addition of 100 mm methanol meoh or tert butyl alcohol tba as both oh and so4 scavenger and only oh scavenger second rate constant k oh meoh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 kso4 meoh 1 6 7 8 107 m 1 s 1 k oh tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 kso4 tba 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020a the bpa degradation decreased from 100 to 81 and 86 within 60 min respectively also the corresponding first order reaction rates declined from 0 0765 ck to 0 0302 w meoh 0 0318 w tba respectively the ros quenching experiments suggest minor contributions of oh and so4 to the bpa degradation we further checked role of 1o2 in the bpa degradation interestingly the bpa degradation dramatically dropped to 17 after the introduction of 10 mm furfuryl alcohol ffa as a 1o2 scavenger second rate constant k 1o2 ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020a the corresponding reaction rates dramatically dropped to 0 0090 min 1 w ffa it is worth noting that ffa can directly react with pms but the catalytic activation of pms by the zvi in the presence of ffa still occurred because the decomposition rate of pms in the zvi pms ffa system was 14 6 fold that in the pms ffa system fig s23 furthermore the pms decomposition rate in the zvi pms system was 5 1 fold that in the pms ffa system although ffa can also directly react with oh and so4 lee et al 2020 wu and kim 2022 both oh and so4 play minor roles in the bpa degradation as verified earlier thus the ffa quenching experiment result indeed suggests the primary role of 1o2 in the bpa degradation in the hf mcr the contributions of other ros such as o2 may be negligible due to their low reduction potentials e g e0 o2 o2 0 33 vnhe short lifetimes and or slow oxidation rates wu et al 2022 to sum up 1o2 dominantly accounts for the bpa degradation and radical processes occur to understand possible bpa degradation pathways we identified intermediate products of bpa degradation using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry uplc ms as shown in fig s24 we detected eight degradation intermediates with benzene ring s which were typically found in singlet oxygen dominated bpa oxidation processes via persulfate activation bu et al 2021 hu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 you et al 2021 this indicates that the bpa degradation in the hf mcr may share the similar same degradation pathways as those in previous studies fig s24 it is worth noting that the hf mcr has a hydraulic residence time of only a few seconds reaction time much shorter than those of batch reaction systems several minutes to hours therefore bpa in the hf mcr might undergo a low degree of mineralization particularly in the late stage of the reaction when zvi is mostly exhausted the enhanced pms activation by zvi boosted the generation of needle and cloud like iron oxyhydr oxides likely corresponding to goethite lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite respectively figs 4g and s25 zhong et al 2021 this observation is similar to previous findings in a zvi per oxides system fu et al 2020 he et al 2016 liang et al 2014 these minerals accounted for the p removal via adsorption and or precipitation nagoya et al 2019 as indicated by the elemental overlapping of fe p and o fig 4h recently guan et al found that coexisting anions such as so4 2 and cl promoted zvi corrosion and thus as iii removal in a weak magnetic field sun et al 2017 they further proposed the simultaneous movement of the anions e g so4 2 with the paramagnetic fe2 in order to maintain local electroneutrality in solution in our hf mcr a considerable amount of so4 2 concentrations up to 139 6 mg l produced from pms as well as phosphate fig s5 likely promoted pms activation by similarly accelerating the zvi corrosion hence the ros and iron oxyhydr oxides production in the hf mcr was further enhanced in turn accounting for the enhanced bpa and p removal 3 3 water flux mediated decontamination we investigated the effect of water flux on the removal of the three contaminants using flows ranging from 122 2 to 476 15 lmh corresponding to hydraulic residence times from 2 7 to 0 7 s fig 5a shows that size sieving maintained nps removal at 100 in contrast when the water flux was increased from 122 2 to 476 15 lmh bpa removal first increased and then decreased particularly in the middle late stage fig 5b unlike the bpa removal p removal followed a monotonically inverse relationship with the water flux fig 5c these results suggest water flux mediated decontamination behaviors the dynamics of the zvi corrosion were visualized to elucidate the water flux induced differences in bpa and p removal fig 5d shows that black zvi microwires were corroded by pms more slowly in the early stage when the water flux was increased from 122 2 to 241 3 lmh as indicated by the lesser and slower growth of brown swelled iron oxyhydr oxides film on their surface the result of larger hydrodynamic force and a shorter hydraulic residence time we observed less pms decomposition by zvi and a higher effluent ph in this stage when the water flux was increased from 122 2 to 241 3 lmh fig s26 this observation further supports slower zvi oxidative corrosion by pms at a higher water flux in the early stage at both water fluxes there was sufficient production of ros and iron oxyhyr oxides to maintain full bpa and p removal in this stage which is in accordance with our earlier observation fig 5b c as the tests proceeded we observed further growth of the iron oxyhydr oxides film on the surface of the zvi microwires at a water flux of 122 2 lmh this passivation film significantly impeded pms activation by the fresh zvi core as reflected by the effluent ph increasing from 3 0 to 3 8 fig s26b benefiting from a higher water flux or larger hydrodynamic force the zvi microwires exhibited a strengthened and accelerated reciprocating movement at the water flux of 241 3 lmh thus forming a considerably smaller and thinner iron oxyhydr oxides film that allowed continuous exposure of fresh iron core to pms this condition favors continuous activation of pms by the zvi microwires as further confirmed by a stable and low effluent ph 3 2 3 5 fig s26b as a result higher bpa removal by ros at a higher water flux was achieved over the course of the whole test and p removal by iron oxyhydr oxides was favored importantly a higher water flux increased the utilization efficiency of the zvi microwires because the higher depassivation exposed more zvi to pms as demonstrated by more thorough corrosion by pms fig 5d however when we further increased the water flux to 476 15 lmh the ros and iron oxyhydr oxides production was significantly reduced due to the very limited hydraulic residence time of 0 7 s fig 5d as indicated by a higher effluent ph 3 8 4 2 accordingly the amounts of both ros and iron oxyhydr oxides were not sufficient to maintain satisfactory decontamination performance and we observed rather low bpa and p removal fig 5d in addition we observed negligible water flux change over the entire course of the operation fig s27 which we ascribed to negligible membrane fouling by nps meanwhile there was no observable zvi in the effluent fig s22 which is attributed to strong magnetic confinement of zvi in summary the water flux affects not only the contact time between the zvi microwires and pms but also the surface depassivation or reactivity of the zvi microwires collectively determining the production of ros and iron oxyhydr oxides for the respective removal of bpa and p in this work an intermediate water flux of 241 3 lmh was thus found favorable for simultaneous decontamination 3 4 sustainable reactivity and decontamination of hf mcr with periodic zvi reloading while the hf mcr can maintain high reactivity toward pms activation by continuous depassivation the loaded zvi is inevitably exhausted and can no longer provide satisfactory bpa and p removal to renew reactivity catalysts are generally reloaded into a mcr so we experimentally performed a 9 cycle run of the hf mcr with periodic membrane washing and zvi reloading fig 6a b shows that nps removal remained at 100 over the course of each test and the water flux remained stable 241 lmh these observations indicate that the hf mcr preserves its membrane pore integrity over the 9 cycle operation without incurring any observable structural damage by pms attack and or ultrasonication to wash the membrane as shown in the fe sem images fig s28 furthermore f release from the ptfe based hfm remained below the recommended drinking water limit 1 mg l in china fig 6c this low level is the result of not only the relatively inert nature of the ptfe material but also the spatial configuration of the hf mcr the front filtration zone and backend catalysis zone fully protected the membrane structure of the filtration zone from being attacked by strongly oxidizing ros particularly so4 and oh in each of the 9 runs the bpa and p removal decreased gradually from 100 to 53 and 59 respectively fig 6a indicating a stable and high decontamination performance over the 9 cycle run impressively the hf mcr treated 7820 l m2 of contaminated water within 35 h and can continue to run without any tangible structural damage in summary our hf mcr platform using magnetically confined catalyst re loading offers high sustainable catalytic reactivity for decontamination its performance is far superior to that of many other reported mcrs which suffer from catalyst depletion and cannot be reloaded lotfi et al 2022 qiu et al 2022 xie et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 4 outlook for future development our hf mcr is capable of simultaneously removing nps bpa and p in a wide ph range of 3 0 9 0 and exhibits higher bpa and p removal in acidic wastewater fig s29 more discussion in text s6 this reactor has also been successfully applied in the treatment of realistic water samples including wwtp effluent and river water figs s30 and s31 more discussion in text s7 the results demonstrate its great potential in water treatment importantly the hf mcr platform is highly tunable and its sieving capability catalytic reactivity durability and other aspects can be optimized for example we can regulate the key parameters such as extending the hydraulic residence time and increasing zvi mass to improve the catalytic performance using a hollow ceramic membrane instead of a polymeric one can provide a longer service life in years while significantly lowering environmental risks caused by release of degradation products besides these other catalytic reaction schemes such as redox reactions and adsorption can be developed to capitalize on the confinement of magnetic nanomaterials composites such as fe3o4 these modifications could significantly extend applicability of the hf mcr technology to advanced waste water treatment targeting in one go such multiple pollutants as trace antibiotics roxarsone metal loids suspended particulates and pathogenic bacteria we envision modular hollow ceramic membrane based hf mcr for example with an enlarged filtration zone and an enlarged reactive zone which is also equipped with automatic re loading process this will promote further development and scale up of the module for small scale and industrial applications 5 conclusion developing a mcr platform that achieves efficient catalyst re loading and sustainable and high catalytic reactivity is of great significance for simultaneous removal of wide spectrum pollutants in complex water in this work we have shown the initial demonstration of a novel magnetic confinement approach to re loading a magnetic nanomaterial zvi and sustaining its high catalytic reactivity in the ample lumen space of a hfm the hf mcr simultaneously and efficiently removes wide spectrum contaminants in a complex water matrix with geometric sizes ranging from subnanometer to several hundred nanometers the front membrane separation process fully removed large nps via size exclusion whereas the following fenton like catalysis process enhanced removal of permeated bpa and p by in situ generated ros primarily 1o2 and iron oxyhydr oxides respectively our study further revealed the unique roles of the magnetic confinement of the catalysts in synergistic and enhanced decontamination efficiently re loading magnetic ultra stabilization under harsh hydrodynamic conditions much improved spatial dispersion and continuously boosted surface depassivation of the zvi lastly we showed that periodic zvi reloading endowed sustainable and high reactivity and lasting decontamination performance of the hf mcr taken together it can be expected that our approach will lead to the development of promising mcrs with the capability of sustainable and enhanced wide spectrum decontamination for future water treatment reclamation declaration of competing interest

15084,microplastic mp pollution is an important challenge for human life which has consequently affected the natural system of other organisms mismanagement and also careless handling of plastics in daily life has led to an accelerating contamination of air water and soil compartments with mp under estuarine conditions interactions with suspended particulate matter spm like fine sediment in the water column play an important role on the fate of mp further studies to better understand the corresponding transport and accumulation mechanisms are required this paper aims at providing a new modeling approach improving the mp settling velocity formulation based on higher suspended fine sediment concentrations as i e existent in estuarine turbidity zones etz the capability of the suggested approach is examined through the modeling of released mp transport in water and their interactions with fine sediment cohesive sediment fluid mud the model results suggest higher concentrations of mp in etz both in the water column as well as the bed sediment which is also supported by measurements the key process in the modeling approach is the integration of small mp particles into estuarine fine sediment aggregates this is realized by means of a threshold sediment concentration above which the effective mp settling velocity increasingly approaches that of the sediment aggregates the model results are in good agreement with measured mp mass concentrations moreover the model results also show that lighter small mp particles can easier escape the etz towards the open sea keywords mp transport fine sediment transport hydrodynamic morphodynamic modeling mp fine sediment interaction flocculation aggregation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the outstanding properties of plastics like lightness durability corrosion resistance and economical effectiveness their application and hence mass production in the industrial as well as daily life has exponentially increased da costa et al 2020 as a result plastics are an omnipresent part in our work and daily life in 2019 the global plastic production has been increased to almost 368 million tons plasticseurope 2020 compared to 1 5 million tons in 1950 plasticseurope 2009 and is expected to reach 25 billion tons by 2050 geyer et al 2017 the numerous adverse effects of the released mismanaged plastics in nature on micro macro organisms have been reported and documented during the last decade e g koelmans et al 2019 however the understanding of transport mechanisms and corresponding physics from detection to modeling are in their infancy as a simple instance there is not a commonly accepted definition for mp with respect to its size which can lead to a spectrum of measured modelled result interpretation an international research workshop on the occurrence effects and fate of microplastic marine debris proposed 5 mm as the upper size limit for mp arthur et al 2009 and usually 1 Âµm is considered in literature as the lower limit allen et al 2022 mp is classified into two groups with respect to its origin primary mp is manufactured in sizes 5 mm laskar and kumar 2019 and mostly applied to cosmetic textile products rugerro et al 2020 or is available for industrial use as pre produced pellets secondary mp results from macro meso plastics through fragmentation chemical uv induced photo degradation solar andrady 2022 biodegradation microbial miri et al 2022 and abrasion mechanical song et al 2017 with respect to this classification it can be concluded that surface runoff municipal as well as industrial waste water treatment plants wwtps are relevant entry pathways for mp into rivers tributaries kay et al 2018 mp contamination loads in rivers are commonly categorized based on the types of input as point e g wwtp and diffusive sources e g mp from atmospheric deposition kernchen et al 2022 or surface runoff rivers as the recipients and pathways of mp contamination loads are supposed to play an important role in the mp transport distribution and accumulation it is estimated that on a yearly basis between 1 15 and 2 41 million tons of mp enter into the open oceans through rivers lebreton et al 2017 moreover the presence of diverse habitats of micro macro organisms in rivers and their direct exposure to mp mccormick et al 2020 green et al 2017 which have a high capacity in adsorption of other toxic pollutants turner and holmes 2015 pronounces the importance of more investigations on mp transport in rivers above all since drinking water that is indirectly provided by rivers jung et al 2022 as well as food resources e g fish wootton et al 2021 emphasize the necessity of these investigations so far most of the available research about mp pollution has been focused on open oceans and alluvial river systems e g auta et al 2017 accordingly the mp transport in tidal rivers and estuaries needs further investigation e g song et al 2022 the research project plawes microplastic contamination in the weser wadden sea national park model system an ecosystem wide approach 2017 2021 was funded by the german federal ministry of education and research to support the investigation of analytical mp measurement methods as well as the development of numerical tools and other biota and social science related investigations plawes aimed to improve the understanding of the basic mechanisms associated with mp transport for the whole weser river catchment down to the german wadden sea the methods and approaches analytical models that were developed in plawes are considered to be transferable to other river catchments and estuaries as well the presented study describes a new numerical estuarine mp transport model with focus on the intense physical interaction between mp and the estuarine cohesive fine sediment dynamics such as inclusion of mp items in fine sediment aggregation and flocculation processes by means of adhesion and cohesion the mp transport model is coupled with a three dimensional hydro morphodynamic numerical model the paper covers the specific implementation and the application of the model system and shows a first comparison with observed mp mass concentrations the approach considers the interaction of mp and estuarine cohesive fine sediments with respect to processes like flocculation aggregation and hindered settling due to the lack of sufficient measured data the model results should so far be seen as a proof of general feasibility rather than a full real world reproduction also the enormous gain of process understanding with respect to the complex transport patterns in estuarine systems becomes clear this research is distinguished by the combination of measurements analyses and numerical modeling and therefore provides a tool for further investigations and system understanding as the applied assessment methods and resulting mp item concentrations in the weser wadden sea transitional system were already presented in roscher et al 2021 the present study focusses on the numerical simulation results the model approach consists of a fully coupled hydro morphodynamic estuarine model which drives a microplastic transport model the implemented approaches to consider the mp fine sediment interaction and its contribution to the overall mp transport are discussed the modelled time frame covers a period around april 2018 when a plawes measuring campaign took place calibrated and validated model results for this time window 01 04 2018 30 04 2018 are presented with respect to the plawes project it should be noted that the model presented here is only one part of a larger model chain which covers the whole weser catchment including land use runoff calculations and their mp contribution brandes et al 2020 the model shown here covers the tidal part of the weser river and the adjacent parts of the german wadden sea the model chain though can be applied to virtually any catchment and estuary 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in northwestern germany where the river weser discharges into the southern north sea fig 1 the open boundaries of the model domain connect it to the open sea in the north and to the upstream part of the river weser in the south where the freshwater discharge from the non tidal part of the catchment is applied minor tributaries are connected at vegesack brake and bremerhaven the tidal part of the weser river stretches about 120 km between the tidal weir in bremen and the north sea the averaged maximum freshwater discharge by the intschede gage for the time span of 1941 2021 is 1201 m3 s the averaged discharge 314 m3 s and the averaged minimum discharge 121 m3 s https www fgg weser de 26 sampling stations along the weser river as well as in the north sea were selected based on the required measurements for the calibration and validation of the numerical model as well as inputs for open boundary conditions from the north sea fig 1 the point sources of mp in this model include 24 wwtp along the sampled weser river section fig 1 the weser estuary can be classified as partially stratified this means that a distinct large scale baroclinic circulation is superimposed on the cyclic tidal flow as a result the estuary has a pronounced estuarine turbidity zone etz with an estuarine turbidity maximum that stretches between brake and bremerhaven fig 1 upstream of brake the river can be considered fully mixed i e no vertical salinity gradient exists further density differences result from partially high fine sediment concentrations in the etz also fluid mud can temporarily be observed there 2 2 data for model application for the weser model application within the plawes project the following data in table 1 were used for bathymetry bottom composition open boundary conditions sources and calibration validation the boundary conditions at the open north sea boundary for the hydrodynamic module were calculated by an overarching large scale model cascade as described in knaack et al 2006 this cascade is driven by tidal constituents astronomic forcing at the north atlantic boundary as well as meteorological forcing icon model table 1 2 3 modeling approach and 3d model setup the 3d model consists of three modules a hydrodynamics b morphodynamics and c mp transport module the first two modules are set up using open source delft3d flow and the latter is implemented as new subroutine in the framework of d water quality delwaq the numerical model code of delft3d flow applied here for the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes is extended after oberrecht 2021 the extension considers fluid mud dynamics and formation by including rheological behavior of high concentrated cohesive fines suspension as well as rheologically induced turbulence damping in the water column the extended approach provides a substantial improvement of the results for the estuarine turbidity zone etz for now waves are not considered within the model approach but a coupling with a spectral wave model basically exists the implementation of the 3d module for mp transport fsk mptm is illustrated by the conceptual sketch in fig 2 the model consists of three modules i the hydro morphodynamic ii water quality and iii mp transport model at the first the hydro morphodynamic parameters current velocity salinity temperature and sediment concentration are computed using the applied model for hydro morphodynamic and the results are written in the form of communication data to couple with the other two parts waq fsk mptm that are run as a postprocessor basically every suitable hydro morphodynamic model solution e g delft3d flow telemac mike 21 or schism could be used to drive the latter two in the fsk mptm module mp properties size polymer density critical shear stress for erosion and sedimentation are input parameters which have to be set by the user mp inputs as boundary conditions can be specified as point or diffusive mp sources at the corresponding positions of river estuary the location for point sources is defined based on the position coordinates of effluents into the river on model boundary as depth averaged loads or separately per vertical layers diffusive sources are defined as fluxes through the river surface where wind direction and speed determine the transport length from the boundary and consequently the flux surface in the model domain in this study mp from wwtps and atmospheric deposition are considered however more complex mp modeling would require to include additional important mp sources like i e tire wear and tributary inflows the model approach can in the future include such mp sources which is beyond this study due to a lack of respective data the settling velocities of mp particles strongly determine the transport process therefore the settling velocities consider several mp specific properties polymer density particle size as well as intensive interaction with other sediment flocculation aggregation hindered settling and microalgae biofouling specific processes since these processes strongly vary in space and time also the resulting settling velocities vary the effect of biofouling on the mp settling velocity is especially important for mp lighter than water Ï m p Ï w like pp and pe and was reported in literature through lab experiments fazey et al 2016 and field campaign kaiser et al 2017 the methodology for simulation of the biofouling thickness proposed by kooi et al 2017 was adopted instead of the empirical equations for water temperature salinity and microalgae concentration from kooi et al 2017 here the modelled values from the module chain shown in fig 2 at each time step are used the approach for mp fine sediment interaction considers different settling velocities depending on the local fine sediment concentration the mp particles are considered either inert or as part of the estuarine flocculation process with transition states in between fig 5 sedimentation and resuspension of mp into from the bed is estimated by comparison of the computed current shear stresses in the hydro morphodynamic model with the critical shear stresses for sedimentation and resuspension as proposed by waldschlÃ¤ger schÃ¼ttrumpf 2019 for sandy sediments and a modified approach after wu et al 2018 for mixed sediments the sedimented or resuspended mp are considered as the sinks and sources in the transport equations respectively 2 3 1 hydrodynamic module the 3d hydrodynamic module is based on a 2d model of hartsuiker 2003 and knaak et al 2006 for the weser estuary which was extended into the three dimensional domain the model solves the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans equations turbulence closure is achieved by means of a turbulent kinetic energy formulation k l model considering baroclinic processes oberrecht 2021 the model provides a robust scheme for tidal wetting and drying of computational cells by considering the minimum threshold depth of 10 cm mass conservation for the algorithm is documented in deltares 2021a this is a relevant feature for applications including wadden sea areas the model is forced by means of the tidal water elevation changes at the open boundary as well as wind generated stresses on the water surface moreover the time series of the river discharge at the most downstream measuring station intschede 52 57 51 048 n 9 7 32 644 e from the federal waterways and shipping administration wsv is used as upstream boundary condition to provide the boundary conditions for the open sea boundary a model cascade from the north sea to the german bay is setup and in each sequence the results of the superordinate model are nested on the boundaries of the subordinate to provide the corresponding values for the open boundary conditions the data for wind speed and direction are read from the icon model results of the german weather service dwd the applied computational grid is structured curvilinear and covers an area of 2185 km2 of the tidal influenced part of river weser with the finest edge length of 20 m in upstream location and coarsest of 400 m at the open boundary the north sea side in the vertical domain the grid is composed of 10 vertical sigma layers the vertical dimension e g depth dimension is divided proportionally to the expected velocity and concentration gradients due to the presence of mp polymers with lower densities than water density Ïmp Ïw or Ïmp Ïw 1 0 on the water surface and presence of pe and pp as the dominant mp based on the literature the uppermost layers close to the surface layer are important therefore the surface region has a higher vertical grid resolution compared with the layers far from the surface analogously due to the presence of settled mp on in the riverbed as well as sediment and their resuspension the layers in the proximity of the sediment bed have higher vertical grid resolution than the middle layers the discretization of the central part of the water column is sufficient to allow for flow stratification due to baroclinic effects fig 3 exemplarily illustrates the vertical dimension of the 3d computational grid for a part of the river the bed roughness is estimated from the van rijn 1984 formulas for roughness prediction deltares 2021a since morphology is also calculated chapter 2 3 2 bed roughness is updated every five minutes the time step for the hydro morphodynamic model run is 6 s 0 1 min 2 3 2 morphodynamic module the bed composition in the model setup is considered as a mixed sediment composed of four fractions fine sediment mud with d 63 Âµm fine sand with 63 Âµm d 200 Âµm medium sand with 200 Âµm d 630 Âµm and coarse sand with d 630 Âµm fig 4 shows the fine sediment fraction distribution in the bed of the weser estuary the data are from the federal waterway administration wsv and aufmod project valerius et al 2013 2015 in contrast to medium and coarse sandy sediment the settling velocity of fine sediment mud is not a constant value and is defined based on the fine sediment concentration within the complex processes of flocculation hindered settling and beginning consolidation of fine sediment the implemented total settling rate formulation in this study covers the entire concentration range of fine sediments as was applied by oberrecht 2021 at very low sediment concentrations c cf settling velocity is assumed as constant below the critical concentration for hindered settling ch the settling behavior is described as a flocculation process where the settling velocity increases with increasing sediment concentration van rijn 1993 if the concentration increases further ch c cgel sediment particles begin to hinder each other because frictional forces become dominant here the settling velocity decreases with increasing concentration additionally the hindered settling behavior allows the formation of fluid mud for hindered settling the formulation presented by fredsoe and deigaard 1992 was implemented the hindered settling formulation is valid up to the gelling concentration cgel when the suspension concentration exceeds the gel concentration the fluid mud layer begins to consolidate the rate of settling in the consolidation regime is calculated according to a simplified formulation proposed by toorman 1992 the corresponding formulation for the settling velocity of the aforementioned processes for fine sediment could be described as 1 w s const c c f k 1 c m c f c c h w s 0 1 a h c b h c h c c gel w sg 0 c c gel Î² c c gel where ws is the settling velocity of fine sediment m s c is the concentration of fine sediment kg m3 and k1 m ah bh Î² are constants and come from the research of oberrecht 2021 these parameters are listed in table s1 of the supplementary material the graphic of this equation is illustrated in fig 5 the critical shear stress for erosion and sedimentation of fine sediment is considered as 0 1 n m2 this equal value for erosion and sedimentation is consistent with the critical shear stress for non consolidated mud fine sediment as is typical between 0 1 0 2 pa mengual et al 2017 2 3 3 mp transport module the 3d numerical mp transport model fsk mptm is developed using the open source cfd toolbox d water quality deltares 2021b mp is considered in the model in terms of particle size polymer density and it s interactions with fine sediment and micro algae the mp representation in the governing equations is formulated as a mass concentration in order to consider the broad variability of mp particle properties mp is considered in discrete classes of different mp particle sizes and polymer densities which are then reflected in the settling velocity formulation in combination with the fine sediment interaction and the biofouling effect this leads to complex mp settling behavior where the effective mp settling velocity is a temporally as well as spatially varying property the settling behavior distinguishes this study from most available literature where usually constant settling velocities for mp independent of its interaction with spm is considered the model considers mp input from basically two types of sources i e point sources and diffuse sources the point sources are mp inputs to the receiving weser river at effluents of wwtps located along the river 2 3 3 1 governing equations mp transport is mathematically formulated based on convection diffusion equations which are coupled with the ambient water parameters flow velocity temperature salinity and fine sediment concentration and additional biological parameters microalgae concentration which are required to approximate the mp interaction with fine sediment andersen et al 2021 and biofouling kooi et al 2017 the transport mechanism of mp could be categorized in the following conceptual relationship 2 dc mp dt c mp from sources convection and diffusion of c mp in water resuspension from sediment mp settling mp fragmentation bioturbation all of aforementioned parts of the transport balance equation apart from the mp fragmentation and bioturbation are included in this research mp fine sediment interaction could be described by means of mp integration into fine sediment aggregates which leads to the variation of mp settling velocity this mechanism has been also observed and reported in literature by andersen et al 2021 and li et al 2019 it is accelerated by increasing the fine sediment concentration where flocculation takes place therefore the new development in d water quality is performed by changing the mp settling velocity through a threshold sediment concentration fig 5 illustrates the five zones for mp fine sediment interactions depending on the fine sediment concentration as can be seen in fig 5 the inert zone is defined as a low concentrated fine sediment where the interaction between mp and sediment is ignored 0 cs c1 in this zone it is supposed that fine sediment and mp follow their own settling velocity the upper threshold concentration of this zone is set to 0 1 kg m3 as was also observed by andersen et al 2021 for the increase of pvc particles settling velocity compared to settling in sea water without fine sediment in the transition zone c1 cs c2 the fine sediment starts to influence the settling velocity of mp however this depends remarkably on the settling velocity of mp if mp has a low settling velocity like biofouled pp or pe the capability of mp aggregation and contact with fine sediment is increased and therefore the mp settling velocity is more influenced by the fine sediment settling velocity in contrast mp with significantly higher densities and therefore higher settling velocities than fine sediment could pass through the fine sediment and therefore the contribution of fine sediment to the mp settling velocity is decreased the transition zone can also be defined by user and as it was determined after calibration for the weser river as 0 1 kg m3 cs 1 kg m3 the lower threshold concentration cs 0 1 kg m3 was also experimentally observed by andersen et al 2021 as the initial fine sediment concentration for mp fine sediment aggregation the third zone is defined as flocculation zone in this zone c2 cs c3 it is supposed that mp with lower settling velocity than fine sediment is captured within the fine sediment flocculation and hence settles with the fine sediment contrary to fine and light mp particles with higher densities as well as coarser mp pass through the fine sediment and are not aggregated this zone can also be defined using a threshold concentration like c3 which is proposed for the weser river as 8 kg m3 i e the mp with lower settling velocity than fine sediment behave like fine sediment in the fine sediment concentration range of 1 kg m3 cs 8 kg m3 it should be noted that the upper boundary value cs 8 kg m3 was also applied by oberrecht 2021 in the morphodynamic model which was also used in this study for modeling the fine sediment concentration in hindered settling zone the settling velocity of fine sediment as well as captured mp is retarded due to the high concentration of fine sediment where by increasing the sediment concentration the settling velocity is reduced due to the high sediment concentration it is supposed that in this zone all of the available mp are integrated to the fine sediment and consequently settle with the velocity of fine sediment this zone of concentration could be defined by user through threshold concentration c4 kg m3 which was taken for the weser river as 50 kg m3 oberrecht 2021 finally the settled sediment in highly concentrated sediment layers in bed start to consolidate and mp is totally enclosed in the sediment bed this layer is defined at sediment concentrations greater than 50 kg m3 where the pore water volume is reduced and sediment shows a higher resistance to the current wave induced bed shear stresses in the inert range the settling velocity of mp wmp is computed using the formulation applied by kooi et al 2017 which was proposed by dietrich 1982 and is given as 3 w mp z t s t Ï mp Ï w z t s t 1 g w mp Ï w z t s t 1 3 where z m is the depth direction with the origin on mean water surface and upward positive direction t s the time of simulation Ï w z t s c s t is the water density kg m3 as a function of water depth temperature t c salinity s psu sediment concentration cs and Ï m p is the mp density kg m3 g gravitational acceleration m s2 w m p is the dimensionless settling velocity of mp and Ï w z t s c s t is the kinematic viscosity of water m2 s the water density is computed by including the salinity temperature and fine sediment concentration at the corresponding water depth therefore it is not a constant value in the model but it is computed as a function of salinity and varies over space and time kooi et al 2017 applied the semi empirical formulas to find the salinity and temperature in different water depths while in this research these values are numerically for the weser river modelled calibrated and then are applied in the equations applying the effect of sediment concentration on the water density Ï w z t s t is computed by means of application the model results for temperature and salinity in the proposed

is the nominal diameter of mp particle and defined as the diameter of a sphere with equivalent volume of mp particle Ï m p t o t is the mp particle density including the effect of biofouling after kooi et al 2017 the details of the specific adaptation of the kooi et al 2017 approach for this model will be published in a separate paper for a basic explanation see supplementary data d n is then calculated as 8 d n 1 5 d 1 d 2 d 3 1 3 where d 1 m and d 2 m are the major long and minor short diameters of an elliptic cylinder with height of d 3 m in contrast to the most available literature which assume in their calculations the shape form of mp particles as a sphere in this research because of high occurrence of fragment like mp roscher et al 2021 an elliptical cylinder is assumed d 1 and d 2 are measured by Âµftir and d 3 depends on the corey shape factor csf of mp particles 9 c s f d 3 d 1 d 2 where a sphere has csf 1 and it changes between 0 and1 for other particle shapes with this assumption the volume of a mp particle is approximated by 10 v c s f 0 25 Ï d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 2 3 3 2 mp sedimentation and resuspension the riverbed is an important reservoir for mp in freshwater as well as in estuaries sedimentation of mp could happen for the light mp by means of aggregation capturing into fine sediment as well as biofouling and for heavy mp heavier than water through their own weight within low energetic flows here sedimentation is captured by means of the critical shear stress for sedimentation Ï c s e d n m 2 which is compared with the calculated shear stress of the flow field in the adjacent computational cell then if the available mp mass in the corresponding computational cell has a positive settling velocity settling velocity towards the bed it starts to settle with a settling velocity calculated using eq 3 critical shear stress for sedimentation is an empirical tuning parameter that depends on the mp polymer density mp particle size and the interaction between mp and spm in the water column in this investigation it is assumed to be close to that of the surrounding fine sediment Ï s e d 0 1 n m 2 is in agreement with literature values and shows a good consistency between measured mp mass concentrations and model results however it could be modified based on the fine sediment concentration or defined as spatially varying in the studied catchment the sedimentation flux for settling mp f s e d k g m 2 s is computed as 11 f sed w mp c mp Î± mp where w m p is calculated by means of eq 3 c m p k g m 3 is the mp mass concentration computed by means of the convection diffusion equation and Î± m p is the mp sedimentation probability function based on an excess shear stress formulation according to the partheniades 1965 krone 1962 formulation delft3d flow manual deltares 2021a as 12 Î± m p s e d 1 Ï Ï c s e d i f Ï Ï c s e d 0 i f Ï Ï c s e d settled mp in sediment could also be resuspended under higher current velocities therefore the bed shear stress determines the resuspension and its corresponding flux into the water column critical bed shear stress for mp depends on the mp physical characteristics i e density and size as well as the surrounded sediment enders et al 2019 the contribution of these parameters is usually determined by means of physical experiments waldschlÃ¤ger and schÃ¼ttrumpf 2019 performed an experimental research to investigate the critical shear stress for resuspension of already available mp particles Ï m p Ï w on sediment composed of sands with different grain size distributions medium and coarse sand as well as fine gravel they proposed an empirical equation which could be applied with a good accuracy for mp as 13 Î¸ c r m p s Ï Î¸ c r s d m p d 50 s Î³ where Î¸ c r m p s is the critical shields parameter for mp in sand and is defined as 14 Î¸ c r m p s Ï c r m p s Ï m p Ï w 1 g d m p 15 Ï c r m p s Î¸ c r m p s Ï m p Ï w 1 g d m p and therefore the critical bed shear stress for resuspension of mp Ï c r m p s n m 2 in sand could be given as where Î¸ c r s in eq 13 is the critical shields parameter of sand d m p m for mp particle size and d 50 s m is the median diameter of sand where 50 of sand is smaller than this size Ï and Î³ are coefficients which were proposed by waldschlÃ¤ger and schÃ¼ttrumpf 2019 as 0 5588 and 0 503 respectively however estuarine sediment often naturally occurs as a mixture from fine sediment and sand therefore the proposed equation by waldschlÃ¤ger and schÃ¼ttrumpf 2019 cannot be applied for fine silty sediment in this research the critical bed shear stress for resuspension of mp is defined spatially varying based on the modelled bed sediment composition a mixture composed of one cohesive sand fraction and three sand fractions i e fine medium and coarse sand mixed sediment cohesive with non cohesive have higher critical bed shear stress against the erosion one of the main reason for this could be the presence of fine cohesive sediments like silt and clay which fill the pore spaces between the non cohesive sediment e g sands and therefore improve the general structure of mixed sediment against erosion therefore coarse fractions keep longer against the near bed current which in terms reduces the total erosion rate of sediment in a mixture compared with each fraction as a single fraction to take this natural characteristic of sediment into account and consequently apply for the settled mp between mixed sediment the critical bed shear stress for a mixture of sand and mud based on the bed composition of the weser river is setup in the model as the critical bed shear stress the proposed equation by wu et al 2018 for critical bed shear stress of mixed sediment is modified for mp as 16 Ï c r m p m Ï c r m p s Ï c r m p p m Ï c r m p s exp f 1 p s p m f 2 where Ï c r m p m n m 2 is the critical resuspension shear stress for mp located among mixed sediment i e mud and sand Ï c r m p p m n m 2 the critical resuspension shear stress for mp located in pure mud p s the percentage of the sand in the mp surrounded mixed sediment p m the percentage of fine sediment mud in the mixture and f 1 f 2 are calibration coefficients due to the lack of an equation for critical resuspension shear stress for mp in pure mud like the already proposed equation for pure sand by waldschlÃ¤ger and schÃ¼tterumpf 2019 the empirical equation proposed by wu et al 2018 for pure mud is modified as 17 Ï c r m p p m k 1 Ï m 1 1 k 2 Ï m p Ï p m k 3 d m p d p m k 4 where k n are the calibration coefficients and given in supplementary material and Ï m is the mud porosity which is given as 18 Ï m 1 Ï d m b Ï s where Ï d m b k g m 3 is the bulk dry density of mud and Ï s k g m 3 the sand density the last two terms in eq 17 are proposed in this research to extend the approach of wu et al 2018 for mp with respect to eq 17 it is assumed that the mp with higher density than pure mud requires higher shear stresses for resuspension moreover in case of mp with the same density of mud the coarser mp are resuspended under higher bed shear stresses calibration parameters in eq 17 are found by means of the comparison of the model results with mp concentrations measured during the plawes campaign roscher et al 2021 this paper finally the resuspension upward directed flux is defined in the same way to the sedimentation flux as 19 f res w mp c mp b Î± mp where 20 Î± mp Ï Ï cr mp m 1 if Ï Ï Ï cr mp m 0 if Ï Ï Ï cr mp m then the available fine sediment concentration in the water column is read from the communication data of hydro morphodynamic results and the mp settling velocity is again calculated based on the available fine sediment concentration in each computational cell therefore based on this approach the settling of mp in the parts of the river with high concentration of fine sediment is increased 2 3 3 3 mp boundary conditions the modeling approach requires boundary conditions which are usually derived from measurements within the mp modeling the lack of sufficient measured data is still a major problem and can up to now only be compensated by assumptions which introduce additional uncertainty into the model solution see also conclusions on the other hand this uncertainty also legitimates adaptions of boundary conditions during the model calibration process since the model internally considers mp mass concentrations further assumptions and calculus are involved eq 9 and eq 10 when measured mp input is given in terms of particle counts roscher et al 2021 these were transformed into mp mass concentrations using the csf of mp fragment particles kooi and koelmans 2019 the csf in eq 10 is assumed as 0 6 and mp polymer densities are considered as provided in the supplementary data of mintenig et al 2020 for the calibration of the mp transport model the mp input by means of the wwtp point sources were varied based on the following procedure as a first guess the measurements from mintenig et al 2017 for seven wwtps brake varel berne neuharlingersiel schillig sandstedt and burhave along the model domain were transferred to the other 19 wwtps this was done by scaling the observed mp particle loads based on the number of inhabitants connected to each wwtp in mintenig et al 2017 measurements this first approach has some major flaws though it is not known how representative these seven wwtps are for the other 19 moreover the wwtps differ with respect to technical details of the treatment additionally the mintenig et al 2017 data are from 2014 and the plawes measurements for tidal part of the weser roscher et al 2021 are from 2018 this time difference of measurements causes further uncertainty furthermore the necessary but inevitably simplified conversion from mp particle counts into mp mass concentrations has a strong inherent uncertainty also on the mp transport model side due to the lack of measurements not all possible mp sources are considered so far e g tire wear mp input from inland dewatering and surface runoff so within the calibration process the wwtp point sources were varied with respect to the initial guess in order to fit the modeled mp results towards the mp mass concentrations observed within the april 2018 plawes campaign table 4 fig 12 it should be also noted that the plawes measurements on the weser river represent the overall mp load and it is not possible to assign them to wwtps or other specific mp sources only the diffusive sources in this study consider atmospheric deposition flux for the cities along the weser river in this research measurements were performed for six stations in the weser catchment kernchen et al 2022 where two of them were positioned in the tidal part of the weser river close to the two major cities bremen and bremerhaven the determined mp concentration values were considered representative as mp diffusive contamination sources mp fluxes from other cities were estimated by means of extrapolating w r t the corresponding population density compared to aforementioned cities the resulting diffusive mp flux into the water body is approximated based on a first order transport length approach wang and lai 2014 using statistical measured data for wind speed and direction table 1 2 4 mp mass determination of selected water

polystyrene c ps polyvinylchloride c pvc polycarbonate c pc polymethlymethacrylate c pmma and mdi methylene diphenyl diisocyanate derived polyurethane c mdi pur corresponding concentrations data are listed in table 4 3 results and discussion in the estuarine range the hydrodynamics interact with salinity and suspended sediment in several complex ways due to their influence on the fluid density e g existence of baroclinic effects and resulting etz becker et al 2013 mp in this surrounding is a completely passive substance with little to no influence on the flow field it is therefore of major importance to first achieve a sound calibration of the coupled hydro morphodynamic model part which drives the mp transport the model results are calibrated by means of available measurements for water level m salinity psu sediment concentration kg m3 temperature c and mp concentration g m3 the sources of the calibration data are given in table 1 3 1 hydrodynamic model for water level because of the important role of the flow field for the transport and resuspension of spm e g sediment and mp calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model is an important prerequisite for the calibration of mp transport model runs forcing boundary values application of wind stresses on the water surface bed parameters for computing the flow energy dissipation e g bed roughness turbulence approach and computational grid resolution are inseparable parts in calibration of a hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model is driven by inland discharges weser lesum hunte ochtum geeste and the open sea boundary tidal water level elevations table 1 to calibrate the hydrodynamic model the computed water levels are compared with the recorded time series at gage stations along the river by tuning the bottom friction values using the auto predictor property of trachytope approach and selecting the van rijn 1984 approach deltares 2021a it is tried to find the best agreement between model results and measurements in this approach the bed forms are actualized after each five time steps of flow calculation and the bed roughness is calculated based on the formula of van rijn 1984 the interested reader is recommended to read the trachytopes classes in the delft3d flow manual deltares 2021a fig 7 shows the comparison between model results with the measurements at different stations along the weser estuary as are shown in fig 6 and their locations with the depth of installation are listed in table s3 the 3d property of the model allows to compare model results and measurements at the same elevations as the measuring gauges table s3 as can be seen in fig 7 the model is capable of reproducing the measurements very well in terms of the water elevation as well as phase agreement the statistical parameter of the pearson correlation factor r between model results and measurements were calculated and is found in table s4 it shows a strong relationship between model and measurements results by r 97 99 akoglu 2018 moreover the brier skill score bss van rijn et al 2003 which is defined as 21 bss 1 model measurements 2 measurements 2 where depicts the mean of assigned value classifies the model performance based on bss in different classes i e bss 1 0 8 excellent 0 8 0 6 good 0 6 0 3 fair 0 3 0 poor and 0 bad it is shown in table s4 that the model performance based on the corresponding bss for the water level is excellent systematic velocity measurements for direct comparison with the model results are not available the excellent statistical agreement between calculated and measured water levels at all available gauges across the model domain table s4 proves the good reproduction of the tidal volume and implicitly ensures realistic flow velocities during the tidal cycle 3 2 hydrodynamic model for salinity salinity on a local scale influences the turbulence production which on a larger scale leads to baroclinic estuarine circulation due to its effect on the density the salinity distribution along the estuary varies horizontally as well as in vertical direction and time therefore a thorough reproduction of the measured salinity time series by the model ensures a realistic baroclinic circulation intensity which is also a relevant prerequisite for realistic suspended sediment and mp transport the salinity transport model is driven by boundary conditions at all open boundaries weser lesum hunte ochtum geeste and the open sea boundary see table 1 fig 8 shows the comparison between the model results and measurements for three stations around the etz as can be seen the model results agree well with the measurements regarding their phase but for the absolute values show a slightly higher longitudinal gradient as observed the statistical parameters for correlation coefficient is between 93 96 and bss varies between 0 76 0 92 which classify the model performance between good to excellent table s5 however the model is able to very well reproduce the salinity for stations rss and bhv where the baroclinic circulation is basically driven 3 3 hydrodynamic model for temperature the importance of the modelled temperature lies in the ecological submodule which computes the microalgae concentration since the algae growth is strongly dependent on temperature a realistic reproduction is important for the biofouling activity on mp see supplementary data the temperature model is driven by boundary conditions at all open boundaries weser lesum hunte ochtum geeste and the open sea boundary see table 1 as can be seen in fig 9 the model results are in good agreement with the measurements in terms of phase and absolute values the statistical parameters for correlation coefficient is between 98 99 and bss varies between 0 68 0 98 which classify the model performance between good to excellent table s6 3 4 morphodynamic model fine sediment concentrations the model results for suspended sediment concentration are compared with measurements fig 10 for three etz stations in the outer weser the model results are reasonable in comparison with measurements particularly for bhv gage station however the measured peak values are underestimated most of the time and also the characteristic spring neap cycle 14 day periodicity is not covered very well since spm concentration are very sensitive to local scale variability in sediment availability and turbulence structure it is a known difficulty in estuarine turbidity modeling to get sufficient agreement between the point measurement and the corresponding computational cell which can inevitably not consider those sub grid variabilities in turbulence and spm values another aspect here is the vertical location of the spm sensors which are all located well above the baroclinic stratification range within the water column as a result the comparison of measured and calculated spm values becomes strongly dependent of the turbulence damping approach which inherits strongly empirical characteristics however the relevant spm concentrations for mp interaction occur in the lower water column where the calculated spm values are well above the threshold for mp sediment interaction the morphodynamic model performance could be further improved by a longer model spin up time schoellhamer et al 2008 and tweaking of the turbulence damping formulation but the achieved result is already sufficient for the use intended here the estuarine turbidity maximum is calculated at the right location and the spm concentrations are high enough to trigger the mp interaction this good qualitative agreement between model and reality also ensures realistic spatial distributions of mp the statistical parameters for correlation coefficient and bss classify the model performance as good except for that of bhv table s7 3 5 mp transport model the mp transport model is run with boundary conditions at open boundaries stations 19 and 20 for the seaside boundary and station 53 for the upstream discharge derived from roscher et al 2021 modified sources from wwtp after mintenig et al 2017 and diffusive atmospherical mp input after kernchen et al 2022 see also chapter 2 3 3 3 and table 1 initial conditions were generated by means of a one month spin up run which was initiated with a spatial interpolation of the dataset from roscher et al 2021 for the water body and halbach scholz boettcher see table 1 for the sediment bed a coarse calibration to meet at least the order of magnitude of observed mp data was possible against a subset of the roscher et al 2021 data set table 2 shows the base polymer types and corresponding properties considered in the model configuration two size classes were distinguished for each polymer type 500 Âµm small mp and 500 Âµm large mp the size classification here reflects the analytical results that were grouped into small and large mp after roscher et al 2021 the sampling stations for model validation are highlighted in fig 11 st 34 st 41 and st 45 are located inside the etz due to higher fine sediment concentrations in the etz these help to evaluate the performance of the described approach for mp fine sediment interaction the model here shows good qualitative agreement w r t significantly increased mp occurrence within the etz as is also reported by roscher et al 2021 fig 12 shows the model validation with the py gc ms results which are methodically completely independent of the calibration and boundary condition data the model reproduces the order of magnitude of the direct measurements with good accuracy this applies even more given the little available calibration data and resulting coarse calibration the model results were taken from the same time frames and also from the water depths as the water samples were taken the good reproduction of mp concentrations compared with the measurements in fig 12 the corresponding values are listed in table 3 is a result of the described deterministic model approach the statistical analysis of the model results in table 3 reveals that the model results are generally over estimated all mean 0 where model results plawes campaign moreover the model shows an excellent performance for c ps bss 0 96 c pc bss 0 81 and c pmma bss 0 89 good for c pet bss 0 67 fair for c pe bss 0 42 c pvc bss 0 32 and bad for c pp bss 0 33 c mdi pur bss 2 25 the overall bss of the model results is 0 69 which classifies the model performance as good a possible explanation for the c mdi pur result is given in the discussion further below the spatial mp distribution and transport are strongly coupled with the estuarine hydro and sediment dynamics as a result the model achieves a good overall distribution even with little mp boundary data availability as is the case with this investigation despite the good overall agreement significant deviations for some polymer types at some locations can be observed mdi pur for example is measured only at stations 45 brk and 34 bhv there is some indication that the modelled pur source is mdi pur which is highly source adherent this has to be confirmed by further analysis and would probably require additional process description for mdi pur polymer in the model however two significant points have to be made here despite huge efforts in sampling and lab analyses for mp loads the available data is still very limited and significantly more data would be necessary to allow a thorough calibration and have robust model results moreover the need to convert particle numbers and averaged particle dimensions into mp mass introduces severe uncertainties as also discussed by primpke et al 2021 the aforementioned points are the reason to consider this investigation merely as an exemplary showcase for the general feasibility of the presented type of model approach a model validation was done with a second and independent plawes data set it is extracted from a larger data set halbach scholz bÃ¶ttcher to be published elsewhere and refers to respective polymer type clusters each of which can be traced back to a base polymer type the advantage of py gc ms results clearly is their direct measurement of mp masses which makes the particle count to mass conversion step unnecessary and avoids the additional uncertainty introduced by the required assumptions see also chapter 2 3 3 3 the presented dataset covers only the size fraction smaller 500 Âµm for selected sampling locations in and around the etz fig 11 in the light of the poor overall data density and the coarse calibration it makes no sense to further discuss the specific deviations between model and measurements here instead the reader should realize that the model approach presented in this study allows very specific identification of existing data shortages with respect to location mp polymer type and physical process formulation fig 13 a h shows 28 days averaged spatial distribution of the surface water mp concentration since the model distinguishes between several polymer types and size classes table 2 with different transport properties the time averaged spatial distribution is shown separately for each polymer type the highest concentrations are generally found in and around the etz between brk and bhv locations see fig 6 which is in good agreement with the observations as an example the distributions of pp and pc show significant differences regarding their time averaged spatial distribution because of their different physical properties and also their availability in the model boundaries and sources pc is significantly denser then pp which lets pc particles settle fast while pp is negatively buoyant and is therefore dominantly transported in the upper water column at least as biofouling in the outer estuary is weak and did not force the pp particles to settle as an exemplary qualitative result one can assume that pp particles easier leave the estuarine zone towards the open sea than pc particles do it also becomes clear that the etz strongly aggregates mp in the high concentrated mud suspension and bottom sediment which serves as a mp sink with respect to the water body as pur so far is modelled without any source adherence the calculated spatial spreading might be far too strong further need for improvement is given for the mp sources that contribute mp into the estuary this for now applies to wwtps and atmospheric deposition on the one hand possibly relevant sources are not yet included e g mp input from dewatering of the hinterland tire wear and on the other hand the available measurements from literature and also from plawes are more or less spot samples that had to be extended to larger time frames as well as a multitude of specific source locations as the result of this investigation shows this might already work as input for some general model runs but definitely does not allows robust results e g to base regulations or management options or assessments on them a comprehensive long term monitoring program for mp measurements is strongly envisaged it could start for the tidal reach of the river weser and be extended to other parts of the coastline if necessary it should include all wwtp effluents and dewatering inflows as well as atmospheric deposition along the weser river the main aim should be to elucidate the corresponding contribution of those sources in parallel the transferability of this data to other estuaries should be checked in the light of the excessive efforts for sample analyses the combination of model results and targeted sampling and analysis seems as a promising approach to purposefully optimize sampling campaigns and also improve the system understanding by further model result validation this mutual dependency should be considered for any further research of mp pollution on larger spatial scales 4 summary and conclusion this paper presents a numerical model approach to study the transport and accumulation of mp in rivers the hydrodynamic model formulation is suited for virtually all water bodies up to partially stratified estuaries the paper shows an exemplary model application for the tidal influenced part of the river weser and its estuary model development and application were carried out within the project framework of plawes which covered the whole weser catchment and dealt with mp sample analyses modeling and other mostly process based developments for the tidal region it was hypothesized that mp to a certain extent would become part of the complex estuarine dynamics especially the large scale baroclinic circulation and in term of interaction with suspended fine sediments which accumulate in the estuarine turbidity zone and exhibit complex flocculation and hindered settling behavior therefore the mp transport model requires a fully coupled three dimensional hydro morphodynamic estuarine model as an important prerequisite the mp transport also considers biofouling of mp particles which also requires a simplified water quality model for micro algae since the presence of mp does by no means influence the hydro and morphodynamic situation the mp transport model can be executed in a post processing step after the hydro morphodynamical model run the mp transport model is implemented based on convection diffusion type equations it considers several mp polymer types and their particle size classes the deterministic approach includes interaction with the estuarine processes on different levels the dominant governing process for the mp here is the settling velocity formulation which considers mp particles as either inert or part of sediment aggregates which form by means of flocculation and aggregation processes and also hindered settling also biofouling is included in terms of settling velocity formulation furthermore mp sedimentation erosion and resuspension are considered to run the model initial and boundary conditions are needed and as far as mp is concerned this draws relevant constraints on the model application so far since measured data are hardly available therefore besides Âµftir data analyzed within plawes literature values had to be used to estimate initial and boundary conditions and additional mp sources the available data allowed a coarse calibration of the mp transport model which leads to good results that could also be validated by means of the first exemplary data of a more comprehensive py gc ms dataset to be published elsewhere the good overall agreement between model and data is a result of the strongly deterministic character of the mp binding to the estuarine processes nonetheless the sparse available input data renders the application shown here merely as an exemplary showcase for the general feasibility of the presented type of model approach the definite conclusion at the present time is that the model can contribute to an efficient as well as organized campaign measurements therefore a combination of both provides much more progress than each of them separately the model approach is suited to consistently extend the point measurements into the complete model area and provides a powerful aid towards better system understanding also the model allows to increase the representativeness of the point measurements which can be considered as a spotlight within a significantly dynamic system by means of time averaging the model results the results clearly show that the combination of both model application and improvement as well as targeted measurements provides much more progress for further improvement of system understanding compared to each of them separately a suggestion for a long term monitoring and analysis program is given

15084,microplastic mp pollution is an important challenge for human life which has consequently affected the natural system of other organisms mismanagement and also careless handling of plastics in daily life has led to an accelerating contamination of air water and soil compartments with mp under estuarine conditions interactions with suspended particulate matter spm like fine sediment in the water column play an important role on the fate of mp further studies to better understand the corresponding transport and accumulation mechanisms are required this paper aims at providing a new modeling approach improving the mp settling velocity formulation based on higher suspended fine sediment concentrations as i e existent in estuarine turbidity zones etz the capability of the suggested approach is examined through the modeling of released mp transport in water and their interactions with fine sediment cohesive sediment fluid mud the model results suggest higher concentrations of mp in etz both in the water column as well as the bed sediment which is also supported by measurements the key process in the modeling approach is the integration of small mp particles into estuarine fine sediment aggregates this is realized by means of a threshold sediment concentration above which the effective mp settling velocity increasingly approaches that of the sediment aggregates the model results are in good agreement with measured mp mass concentrations moreover the model results also show that lighter small mp particles can easier escape the etz towards the open sea keywords mp transport fine sediment transport hydrodynamic morphodynamic modeling mp fine sediment interaction flocculation aggregation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the outstanding properties of plastics like lightness durability corrosion resistance and economical effectiveness their application and hence mass production in the industrial as well as daily life has exponentially increased da costa et al 2020 as a result plastics are an omnipresent part in our work and daily life in 2019 the global plastic production has been increased to almost 368 million tons plasticseurope 2020 compared to 1 5 million tons in 1950 plasticseurope 2009 and is expected to reach 25 billion tons by 2050 geyer et al 2017 the numerous adverse effects of the released mismanaged plastics in nature on micro macro organisms have been reported and documented during the last decade e g koelmans et al 2019 however the understanding of transport mechanisms and corresponding physics from detection to modeling are in their infancy as a simple instance there is not a commonly accepted definition for mp with respect to its size which can lead to a spectrum of measured modelled result interpretation an international research workshop on the occurrence effects and fate of microplastic marine debris proposed 5 mm as the upper size limit for mp arthur et al 2009 and usually 1 Âµm is considered in literature as the lower limit allen et al 2022 mp is classified into two groups with respect to its origin primary mp is manufactured in sizes 5 mm laskar and kumar 2019 and mostly applied to cosmetic textile products rugerro et al 2020 or is available for industrial use as pre produced pellets secondary mp results from macro meso plastics through fragmentation chemical uv induced photo degradation solar andrady 2022 biodegradation microbial miri et al 2022 and abrasion mechanical song et al 2017 with respect to this classification it can be concluded that surface runoff municipal as well as industrial waste water treatment plants wwtps are relevant entry pathways for mp into rivers tributaries kay et al 2018 mp contamination loads in rivers are commonly categorized based on the types of input as point e g wwtp and diffusive sources e g mp from atmospheric deposition kernchen et al 2022 or surface runoff rivers as the recipients and pathways of mp contamination loads are supposed to play an important role in the mp transport distribution and accumulation it is estimated that on a yearly basis between 1 15 and 2 41 million tons of mp enter into the open oceans through rivers lebreton et al 2017 moreover the presence of diverse habitats of micro macro organisms in rivers and their direct exposure to mp mccormick et al 2020 green et al 2017 which have a high capacity in adsorption of other toxic pollutants turner and holmes 2015 pronounces the importance of more investigations on mp transport in rivers above all since drinking water that is indirectly provided by rivers jung et al 2022 as well as food resources e g fish wootton et al 2021 emphasize the necessity of these investigations so far most of the available research about mp pollution has been focused on open oceans and alluvial river systems e g auta et al 2017 accordingly the mp transport in tidal rivers and estuaries needs further investigation e g song et al 2022 the research project plawes microplastic contamination in the weser wadden sea national park model system an ecosystem wide approach 2017 2021 was funded by the german federal ministry of education and research to support the investigation of analytical mp measurement methods as well as the development of numerical tools and other biota and social science related investigations plawes aimed to improve the understanding of the basic mechanisms associated with mp transport for the whole weser river catchment down to the german wadden sea the methods and approaches analytical models that were developed in plawes are considered to be transferable to other river catchments and estuaries as well the presented study describes a new numerical estuarine mp transport model with focus on the intense physical interaction between mp and the estuarine cohesive fine sediment dynamics such as inclusion of mp items in fine sediment aggregation and flocculation processes by means of adhesion and cohesion the mp transport model is coupled with a three dimensional hydro morphodynamic numerical model the paper covers the specific implementation and the application of the model system and shows a first comparison with observed mp mass concentrations the approach considers the interaction of mp and estuarine cohesive fine sediments with respect to processes like flocculation aggregation and hindered settling due to the lack of sufficient measured data the model results should so far be seen as a proof of general feasibility rather than a full real world reproduction also the enormous gain of process understanding with respect to the complex transport patterns in estuarine systems becomes clear this research is distinguished by the combination of measurements analyses and numerical modeling and therefore provides a tool for further investigations and system understanding as the applied assessment methods and resulting mp item concentrations in the weser wadden sea transitional system were already presented in roscher et al 2021 the present study focusses on the numerical simulation results the model approach consists of a fully coupled hydro morphodynamic estuarine model which drives a microplastic transport model the implemented approaches to consider the mp fine sediment interaction and its contribution to the overall mp transport are discussed the modelled time frame covers a period around april 2018 when a plawes measuring campaign took place calibrated and validated model results for this time window 01 04 2018 30 04 2018 are presented with respect to the plawes project it should be noted that the model presented here is only one part of a larger model chain which covers the whole weser catchment including land use runoff calculations and their mp contribution brandes et al 2020 the model shown here covers the tidal part of the weser river and the adjacent parts of the german wadden sea the model chain though can be applied to virtually any catchment and estuary 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in northwestern germany where the river weser discharges into the southern north sea fig 1 the open boundaries of the model domain connect it to the open sea in the north and to the upstream part of the river weser in the south where the freshwater discharge from the non tidal part of the catchment is applied minor tributaries are connected at vegesack brake and bremerhaven the tidal part of the weser river stretches about 120 km between the tidal weir in bremen and the north sea the averaged maximum freshwater discharge by the intschede gage for the time span of 1941 2021 is 1201 m3 s the averaged discharge 314 m3 s and the averaged minimum discharge 121 m3 s https www fgg weser de 26 sampling stations along the weser river as well as in the north sea were selected based on the required measurements for the calibration and validation of the numerical model as well as inputs for open boundary conditions from the north sea fig 1 the point sources of mp in this model include 24 wwtp along the sampled weser river section fig 1 the weser estuary can be classified as partially stratified this means that a distinct large scale baroclinic circulation is superimposed on the cyclic tidal flow as a result the estuary has a pronounced estuarine turbidity zone etz with an estuarine turbidity maximum that stretches between brake and bremerhaven fig 1 upstream of brake the river can be considered fully mixed i e no vertical salinity gradient exists further density differences result from partially high fine sediment concentrations in the etz also fluid mud can temporarily be observed there 2 2 data for model application for the weser model application within the plawes project the following data in table 1 were used for bathymetry bottom composition open boundary conditions sources and calibration validation the boundary conditions at the open north sea boundary for the hydrodynamic module were calculated by an overarching large scale model cascade as described in knaack et al 2006 this cascade is driven by tidal constituents astronomic forcing at the north atlantic boundary as well as meteorological forcing icon model table 1 2 3 modeling approach and 3d model setup the 3d model consists of three modules a hydrodynamics b morphodynamics and c mp transport module the first two modules are set up using open source delft3d flow and the latter is implemented as new subroutine in the framework of d water quality delwaq the numerical model code of delft3d flow applied here for the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes is extended after oberrecht 2021 the extension considers fluid mud dynamics and formation by including rheological behavior of high concentrated cohesive fines suspension as well as rheologically induced turbulence damping in the water column the extended approach provides a substantial improvement of the results for the estuarine turbidity zone etz for now waves are not considered within the model approach but a coupling with a spectral wave model basically exists the implementation of the 3d module for mp transport fsk mptm is illustrated by the conceptual sketch in fig 2 the model consists of three modules i the hydro morphodynamic ii water quality and iii mp transport model at the first the hydro morphodynamic parameters current velocity salinity temperature and sediment concentration are computed using the applied model for hydro morphodynamic and the results are written in the form of communication data to couple with the other two parts waq fsk mptm that are run as a postprocessor basically every suitable hydro morphodynamic model solution e g delft3d flow telemac mike 21 or schism could be used to drive the latter two in the fsk mptm module mp properties size polymer density critical shear stress for erosion and sedimentation are input parameters which have to be set by the user mp inputs as boundary conditions can be specified as point or diffusive mp sources at the corresponding positions of river estuary the location for point sources is defined based on the position coordinates of effluents into the river on model boundary as depth averaged loads or separately per vertical layers diffusive sources are defined as fluxes through the river surface where wind direction and speed determine the transport length from the boundary and consequently the flux surface in the model domain in this study mp from wwtps and atmospheric deposition are considered however more complex mp modeling would require to include additional important mp sources like i e tire wear and tributary inflows the model approach can in the future include such mp sources which is beyond this study due to a lack of respective data the settling velocities of mp particles strongly determine the transport process therefore the settling velocities consider several mp specific properties polymer density particle size as well as intensive interaction with other sediment flocculation aggregation hindered settling and microalgae biofouling specific processes since these processes strongly vary in space and time also the resulting settling velocities vary the effect of biofouling on the mp settling velocity is especially important for mp lighter than water Ï m p Ï w like pp and pe and was reported in literature through lab experiments fazey et al 2016 and field campaign kaiser et al 2017 the methodology for simulation of the biofouling thickness proposed by kooi et al 2017 was adopted instead of the empirical equations for water temperature salinity and microalgae concentration from kooi et al 2017 here the modelled values from the module chain shown in fig 2 at each time step are used the approach for mp fine sediment interaction considers different settling velocities depending on the local fine sediment concentration the mp particles are considered either inert or as part of the estuarine flocculation process with transition states in between fig 5 sedimentation and resuspension of mp into from the bed is estimated by comparison of the computed current shear stresses in the hydro morphodynamic model with the critical shear stresses for sedimentation and resuspension as proposed by waldschlÃ¤ger schÃ¼ttrumpf 2019 for sandy sediments and a modified approach after wu et al 2018 for mixed sediments the sedimented or resuspended mp are considered as the sinks and sources in the transport equations respectively 2 3 1 hydrodynamic module the 3d hydrodynamic module is based on a 2d model of hartsuiker 2003 and knaak et al 2006 for the weser estuary which was extended into the three dimensional domain the model solves the three dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans equations turbulence closure is achieved by means of a turbulent kinetic energy formulation k l model considering baroclinic processes oberrecht 2021 the model provides a robust scheme for tidal wetting and drying of computational cells by considering the minimum threshold depth of 10 cm mass conservation for the algorithm is documented in deltares 2021a this is a relevant feature for applications including wadden sea areas the model is forced by means of the tidal water elevation changes at the open boundary as well as wind generated stresses on the water surface moreover the time series of the river discharge at the most downstream measuring station intschede 52 57 51 048 n 9 7 32 644 e from the federal waterways and shipping administration wsv is used as upstream boundary condition to provide the boundary conditions for the open sea boundary a model cascade from the north sea to the german bay is setup and in each sequence the results of the superordinate model are nested on the boundaries of the subordinate to provide the corresponding values for the open boundary conditions the data for wind speed and direction are read from the icon model results of the german weather service dwd the applied computational grid is structured curvilinear and covers an area of 2185 km2 of the tidal influenced part of river weser with the finest edge length of 20 m in upstream location and coarsest of 400 m at the open boundary the north sea side in the vertical domain the grid is composed of 10 vertical sigma layers the vertical dimension e g depth dimension is divided proportionally to the expected velocity and concentration gradients due to the presence of mp polymers with lower densities than water density Ïmp Ïw or Ïmp Ïw 1 0 on the water surface and presence of pe and pp as the dominant mp based on the literature the uppermost layers close to the surface layer are important therefore the surface region has a higher vertical grid resolution compared with the layers far from the surface analogously due to the presence of settled mp on in the riverbed as well as sediment and their resuspension the layers in the proximity of the sediment bed have higher vertical grid resolution than the middle layers the discretization of the central part of the water column is sufficient to allow for flow stratification due to baroclinic effects fig 3 exemplarily illustrates the vertical dimension of the 3d computational grid for a part of the river the bed roughness is estimated from the van rijn 1984 formulas for roughness prediction deltares 2021a since morphology is also calculated chapter 2 3 2 bed roughness is updated every five minutes the time step for the hydro morphodynamic model run is 6 s 0 1 min 2 3 2 morphodynamic module the bed composition in the model setup is considered as a mixed sediment composed of four fractions fine sediment mud with d 63 Âµm fine sand with 63 Âµm d 200 Âµm medium sand with 200 Âµm d 630 Âµm and coarse sand with d 630 Âµm fig 4 shows the fine sediment fraction distribution in the bed of the weser estuary the data are from the federal waterway administration wsv and aufmod project valerius et al 2013 2015 in contrast to medium and coarse sandy sediment the settling velocity of fine sediment mud is not a constant value and is defined based on the fine sediment concentration within the complex processes of flocculation hindered settling and beginning consolidation of fine sediment the implemented total settling rate formulation in this study covers the entire concentration range of fine sediments as was applied by oberrecht 2021 at very low sediment concentrations c cf settling velocity is assumed as constant below the critical concentration for hindered settling ch the settling behavior is described as a flocculation process where the settling velocity increases with increasing sediment concentration van rijn 1993 if the concentration increases further ch c cgel sediment particles begin to hinder each other because frictional forces become dominant here the settling velocity decreases with increasing concentration additionally the hindered settling behavior allows the formation of fluid mud for hindered settling the formulation presented by fredsoe and deigaard 1992 was implemented the hindered settling formulation is valid up to the gelling concentration cgel when the suspension concentration exceeds the gel concentration the fluid mud layer begins to consolidate the rate of settling in the consolidation regime is calculated according to a simplified formulation proposed by toorman 1992 the corresponding formulation for the settling velocity of the aforementioned processes for fine sediment could be described as 1 w s const c c f k 1 c m c f c c h w s 0 1 a h c b h c h c c gel w sg 0 c c gel Î² c c gel where ws is the settling velocity of fine sediment m s c is the concentration of fine sediment kg m3 and k1 m ah bh Î² are constants and come from the research of oberrecht 2021 these parameters are listed in table s1 of the supplementary material the graphic of this equation is illustrated in fig 5 the critical shear stress for erosion and sedimentation of fine sediment is considered as 0 1 n m2 this equal value for erosion and sedimentation is consistent with the critical shear stress for non consolidated mud fine sediment as is typical between 0 1 0 2 pa mengual et al 2017 2 3 3 mp transport module the 3d numerical mp transport model fsk mptm is developed using the open source cfd toolbox d water quality deltares 2021b mp is considered in the model in terms of particle size polymer density and it s interactions with fine sediment and micro algae the mp representation in the governing equations is formulated as a mass concentration in order to consider the broad variability of mp particle properties mp is considered in discrete classes of different mp particle sizes and polymer densities which are then reflected in the settling velocity formulation in combination with the fine sediment interaction and the biofouling effect this leads to complex mp settling behavior where the effective mp settling velocity is a temporally as well as spatially varying property the settling behavior distinguishes this study from most available literature where usually constant settling velocities for mp independent of its interaction with spm is considered the model considers mp input from basically two types of sources i e point sources and diffuse sources the point sources are mp inputs to the receiving weser river at effluents of wwtps located along the river 2 3 3 1 governing equations mp transport is mathematically formulated based on convection diffusion equations which are coupled with the ambient water parameters flow velocity temperature salinity and fine sediment concentration and additional biological parameters microalgae concentration which are required to approximate the mp interaction with fine sediment andersen et al 2021 and biofouling kooi et al 2017 the transport mechanism of mp could be categorized in the following conceptual relationship 2 dc mp dt c mp from sources convection and diffusion of c mp in water resuspension from sediment mp settling mp fragmentation bioturbation all of aforementioned parts of the transport balance equation apart from the mp fragmentation and bioturbation are included in this research mp fine sediment interaction could be described by means of mp integration into fine sediment aggregates which leads to the variation of mp settling velocity this mechanism has been also observed and reported in literature by andersen et al 2021 and li et al 2019 it is accelerated by increasing the fine sediment concentration where flocculation takes place therefore the new development in d water quality is performed by changing the mp settling velocity through a threshold sediment concentration fig 5 illustrates the five zones for mp fine sediment interactions depending on the fine sediment concentration as can be seen in fig 5 the inert zone is defined as a low concentrated fine sediment where the interaction between mp and sediment is ignored 0 cs c1 in this zone it is supposed that fine sediment and mp follow their own settling velocity the upper threshold concentration of this zone is set to 0 1 kg m3 as was also observed by andersen et al 2021 for the increase of pvc particles settling velocity compared to settling in sea water without fine sediment in the transition zone c1 cs c2 the fine sediment starts to influence the settling velocity of mp however this depends remarkably on the settling velocity of mp if mp has a low settling velocity like biofouled pp or pe the capability of mp aggregation and contact with fine sediment is increased and therefore the mp settling velocity is more influenced by the fine sediment settling velocity in contrast mp with significantly higher densities and therefore higher settling velocities than fine sediment could pass through the fine sediment and therefore the contribution of fine sediment to the mp settling velocity is decreased the transition zone can also be defined by user and as it was determined after calibration for the weser river as 0 1 kg m3 cs 1 kg m3 the lower threshold concentration cs 0 1 kg m3 was also experimentally observed by andersen et al 2021 as the initial fine sediment concentration for mp fine sediment aggregation the third zone is defined as flocculation zone in this zone c2 cs c3 it is supposed that mp with lower settling velocity than fine sediment is captured within the fine sediment flocculation and hence settles with the fine sediment contrary to fine and light mp particles with higher densities as well as coarser mp pass through the fine sediment and are not aggregated this zone can also be defined using a threshold concentration like c3 which is proposed for the weser river as 8 kg m3 i e the mp with lower settling velocity than fine sediment behave like fine sediment in the fine sediment concentration range of 1 kg m3 cs 8 kg m3 it should be noted that the upper boundary value cs 8 kg m3 was also applied by oberrecht 2021 in the morphodynamic model which was also used in this study for modeling the fine sediment concentration in hindered settling zone the settling velocity of fine sediment as well as captured mp is retarded due to the high concentration of fine sediment where by increasing the sediment concentration the settling velocity is reduced due to the high sediment concentration it is supposed that in this zone all of the available mp are integrated to the fine sediment and consequently settle with the velocity of fine sediment this zone of concentration could be defined by user through threshold concentration c4 kg m3 which was taken for the weser river as 50 kg m3 oberrecht 2021 finally the settled sediment in highly concentrated sediment layers in bed start to consolidate and mp is totally enclosed in the sediment bed this layer is defined at sediment concentrations greater than 50 kg m3 where the pore water volume is reduced and sediment shows a higher resistance to the current wave induced bed shear stresses in the inert range the settling velocity of mp wmp is computed using the formulation applied by kooi et al 2017 which was proposed by dietrich 1982 and is given as 3 w mp z t s t Ï mp Ï w z t s t 1 g w mp Ï w z t s t 1 3 where z m is the depth direction with the origin on mean water surface and upward positive direction t s the time of simulation Ï w z t s c s t is the water density kg m3 as a function of water depth temperature t c salinity s psu sediment concentration cs and Ï m p is the mp density kg m3 g gravitational acceleration m s2 w m p is the dimensionless settling velocity of mp and Ï w z t s c s t is the kinematic viscosity of water m2 s the water density is computed by including the salinity temperature and fine sediment concentration at the corresponding water depth therefore it is not a constant value in the model but it is computed as a function of salinity and varies over space and time kooi et al 2017 applied the semi empirical formulas to find the salinity and temperature in different water depths while in this research these values are numerically for the weser river modelled calibrated and then are applied in the equations applying the effect of sediment concentration on the water density Ï w z t s t is computed by means of application the model results for temperature and salinity in the proposed

given in table s1 of the supplementary material kinematic water viscosity Ï w is also computed for each time step by means of the computed model results for temperature and salinity in the

is the nominal diameter of mp particle and defined as the diameter of a sphere with equivalent volume of mp particle Ï m p t o t is the mp particle density including the effect of biofouling after kooi et al 2017 the details of the specific adaptation of the kooi et al 2017 approach for this model will be published in a separate paper for a basic explanation see supplementary data d n is then calculated as 8 d n 1 5 d 1 d 2 d 3 1 3 where d 1 m and d 2 m are the major long and minor short diameters of an elliptic cylinder with height of d 3 m in contrast to the most available literature which assume in their calculations the shape form of mp particles as a sphere in this research because of high occurrence of fragment like mp roscher et al 2021 an elliptical cylinder is assumed d 1 and d 2 are measured by Âµftir and d 3 depends on the corey shape factor csf of mp particles 9 c s f d 3 d 1 d 2 where a sphere has csf 1 and it changes between 0 and1 for other particle shapes with this assumption the volume of a mp particle is approximated by 10 v c s f 0 25 Ï d 1 d 2 d 1 d 2 2 3 3 2 mp sedimentation and resuspension the riverbed is an important reservoir for mp in freshwater as well as in estuaries sedimentation of mp could happen for the light mp by means of aggregation capturing into fine sediment as well as biofouling and for heavy mp heavier than water through their own weight within low energetic flows here sedimentation is captured by means of the critical shear stress for sedimentation Ï c s e d n m 2 which is compared with the calculated shear stress of the flow field in the adjacent computational cell then if the available mp mass in the corresponding computational cell has a positive settling velocity settling velocity towards the bed it starts to settle with a settling velocity calculated using eq 3 critical shear stress for sedimentation is an empirical tuning parameter that depends on the mp polymer density mp particle size and the interaction between mp and spm in the water column in this investigation it is assumed to be close to that of the surrounding fine sediment Ï s e d 0 1 n m 2 is in agreement with literature values and shows a good consistency between measured mp mass concentrations and model results however it could be modified based on the fine sediment concentration or defined as spatially varying in the studied catchment the sedimentation flux for settling mp f s e d k g m 2 s is computed as 11 f sed w mp c mp Î± mp where w m p is calculated by means of eq 3 c m p k g m 3 is the mp mass concentration computed by means of the convection diffusion equation and Î± m p is the mp sedimentation probability function based on an excess shear stress formulation according to the partheniades 1965 krone 1962 formulation delft3d flow manual deltares 2021a as 12 Î± m p s e d 1 Ï Ï c s e d i f Ï Ï c s e d 0 i f Ï Ï c s e d settled mp in sediment could also be resuspended under higher current velocities therefore the bed shear stress determines the resuspension and its corresponding flux into the water column critical bed shear stress for mp depends on the mp physical characteristics i e density and size as well as the surrounded sediment enders et al 2019 the contribution of these parameters is usually determined by means of physical experiments waldschlÃ¤ger and schÃ¼ttrumpf 2019 performed an experimental research to investigate the critical shear stress for resuspension of already available mp particles Ï m p Ï w on sediment composed of sands with different grain size distributions medium and coarse sand as well as fine gravel they proposed an empirical equation which could be applied with a good accuracy for mp as 13 Î¸ c r m p s Ï Î¸ c r s d m p d 50 s Î³ where Î¸ c r m p s is the critical shields parameter for mp in sand and is defined as 14 Î¸ c r m p s Ï c r m p s Ï m p Ï w 1 g d m p 15 Ï c r m p s Î¸ c r m p s Ï m p Ï w 1 g d m p and therefore the critical bed shear stress for resuspension of mp Ï c r m p s n m 2 in sand could be given as where Î¸ c r s in eq 13 is the critical shields parameter of sand d m p m for mp particle size and d 50 s m is the median diameter of sand where 50 of sand is smaller than this size Ï and Î³ are coefficients which were proposed by waldschlÃ¤ger and schÃ¼ttrumpf 2019 as 0 5588 and 0 503 respectively however estuarine sediment often naturally occurs as a mixture from fine sediment and sand therefore the proposed equation by waldschlÃ¤ger and schÃ¼ttrumpf 2019 cannot be applied for fine silty sediment in this research the critical bed shear stress for resuspension of mp is defined spatially varying based on the modelled bed sediment composition a mixture composed of one cohesive sand fraction and three sand fractions i e fine medium and coarse sand mixed sediment cohesive with non cohesive have higher critical bed shear stress against the erosion one of the main reason for this could be the presence of fine cohesive sediments like silt and clay which fill the pore spaces between the non cohesive sediment e g sands and therefore improve the general structure of mixed sediment against erosion therefore coarse fractions keep longer against the near bed current which in terms reduces the total erosion rate of sediment in a mixture compared with each fraction as a single fraction to take this natural characteristic of sediment into account and consequently apply for the settled mp between mixed sediment the critical bed shear stress for a mixture of sand and mud based on the bed composition of the weser river is setup in the model as the critical bed shear stress the proposed equation by wu et al 2018 for critical bed shear stress of mixed sediment is modified for mp as 16 Ï c r m p m Ï c r m p s Ï c r m p p m Ï c r m p s exp f 1 p s p m f 2 where Ï c r m p m n m 2 is the critical resuspension shear stress for mp located among mixed sediment i e mud and sand Ï c r m p p m n m 2 the critical resuspension shear stress for mp located in pure mud p s the percentage of the sand in the mp surrounded mixed sediment p m the percentage of fine sediment mud in the mixture and f 1 f 2 are calibration coefficients due to the lack of an equation for critical resuspension shear stress for mp in pure mud like the already proposed equation for pure sand by waldschlÃ¤ger and schÃ¼tterumpf 2019 the empirical equation proposed by wu et al 2018 for pure mud is modified as 17 Ï c r m p p m k 1 Ï m 1 1 k 2 Ï m p Ï p m k 3 d m p d p m k 4 where k n are the calibration coefficients and given in supplementary material and Ï m is the mud porosity which is given as 18 Ï m 1 Ï d m b Ï s where Ï d m b k g m 3 is the bulk dry density of mud and Ï s k g m 3 the sand density the last two terms in eq 17 are proposed in this research to extend the approach of wu et al 2018 for mp with respect to eq 17 it is assumed that the mp with higher density than pure mud requires higher shear stresses for resuspension moreover in case of mp with the same density of mud the coarser mp are resuspended under higher bed shear stresses calibration parameters in eq 17 are found by means of the comparison of the model results with mp concentrations measured during the plawes campaign roscher et al 2021 this paper finally the resuspension upward directed flux is defined in the same way to the sedimentation flux as 19 f res w mp c mp b Î± mp where 20 Î± mp Ï Ï cr mp m 1 if Ï Ï Ï cr mp m 0 if Ï Ï Ï cr mp m then the available fine sediment concentration in the water column is read from the communication data of hydro morphodynamic results and the mp settling velocity is again calculated based on the available fine sediment concentration in each computational cell therefore based on this approach the settling of mp in the parts of the river with high concentration of fine sediment is increased 2 3 3 3 mp boundary conditions the modeling approach requires boundary conditions which are usually derived from measurements within the mp modeling the lack of sufficient measured data is still a major problem and can up to now only be compensated by assumptions which introduce additional uncertainty into the model solution see also conclusions on the other hand this uncertainty also legitimates adaptions of boundary conditions during the model calibration process since the model internally considers mp mass concentrations further assumptions and calculus are involved eq 9 and eq 10 when measured mp input is given in terms of particle counts roscher et al 2021 these were transformed into mp mass concentrations using the csf of mp fragment particles kooi and koelmans 2019 the csf in eq 10 is assumed as 0 6 and mp polymer densities are considered as provided in the supplementary data of mintenig et al 2020 for the calibration of the mp transport model the mp input by means of the wwtp point sources were varied based on the following procedure as a first guess the measurements from mintenig et al 2017 for seven wwtps brake varel berne neuharlingersiel schillig sandstedt and burhave along the model domain were transferred to the other 19 wwtps this was done by scaling the observed mp particle loads based on the number of inhabitants connected to each wwtp in mintenig et al 2017 measurements this first approach has some major flaws though it is not known how representative these seven wwtps are for the other 19 moreover the wwtps differ with respect to technical details of the treatment additionally the mintenig et al 2017 data are from 2014 and the plawes measurements for tidal part of the weser roscher et al 2021 are from 2018 this time difference of measurements causes further uncertainty furthermore the necessary but inevitably simplified conversion from mp particle counts into mp mass concentrations has a strong inherent uncertainty also on the mp transport model side due to the lack of measurements not all possible mp sources are considered so far e g tire wear mp input from inland dewatering and surface runoff so within the calibration process the wwtp point sources were varied with respect to the initial guess in order to fit the modeled mp results towards the mp mass concentrations observed within the april 2018 plawes campaign table 4 fig 12 it should be also noted that the plawes measurements on the weser river represent the overall mp load and it is not possible to assign them to wwtps or other specific mp sources only the diffusive sources in this study consider atmospheric deposition flux for the cities along the weser river in this research measurements were performed for six stations in the weser catchment kernchen et al 2022 where two of them were positioned in the tidal part of the weser river close to the two major cities bremen and bremerhaven the determined mp concentration values were considered representative as mp diffusive contamination sources mp fluxes from other cities were estimated by means of extrapolating w r t the corresponding population density compared to aforementioned cities the resulting diffusive mp flux into the water body is approximated based on a first order transport length approach wang and lai 2014 using statistical measured data for wind speed and direction table 1 2 4 mp mass determination of selected water

polystyrene c ps polyvinylchloride c pvc polycarbonate c pc polymethlymethacrylate c pmma and mdi methylene diphenyl diisocyanate derived polyurethane c mdi pur corresponding concentrations data are listed in table 4 3 results and discussion in the estuarine range the hydrodynamics interact with salinity and suspended sediment in several complex ways due to their influence on the fluid density e g existence of baroclinic effects and resulting etz becker et al 2013 mp in this surrounding is a completely passive substance with little to no influence on the flow field it is therefore of major importance to first achieve a sound calibration of the coupled hydro morphodynamic model part which drives the mp transport the model results are calibrated by means of available measurements for water level m salinity psu sediment concentration kg m3 temperature c and mp concentration g m3 the sources of the calibration data are given in table 1 3 1 hydrodynamic model for water level because of the important role of the flow field for the transport and resuspension of spm e g sediment and mp calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model is an important prerequisite for the calibration of mp transport model runs forcing boundary values application of wind stresses on the water surface bed parameters for computing the flow energy dissipation e g bed roughness turbulence approach and computational grid resolution are inseparable parts in calibration of a hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model is driven by inland discharges weser lesum hunte ochtum geeste and the open sea boundary tidal water level elevations table 1 to calibrate the hydrodynamic model the computed water levels are compared with the recorded time series at gage stations along the river by tuning the bottom friction values using the auto predictor property of trachytope approach and selecting the van rijn 1984 approach deltares 2021a it is tried to find the best agreement between model results and measurements in this approach the bed forms are actualized after each five time steps of flow calculation and the bed roughness is calculated based on the formula of van rijn 1984 the interested reader is recommended to read the trachytopes classes in the delft3d flow manual deltares 2021a fig 7 shows the comparison between model results with the measurements at different stations along the weser estuary as are shown in fig 6 and their locations with the depth of installation are listed in table s3 the 3d property of the model allows to compare model results and measurements at the same elevations as the measuring gauges table s3 as can be seen in fig 7 the model is capable of reproducing the measurements very well in terms of the water elevation as well as phase agreement the statistical parameter of the pearson correlation factor r between model results and measurements were calculated and is found in table s4 it shows a strong relationship between model and measurements results by r 97 99 akoglu 2018 moreover the brier skill score bss van rijn et al 2003 which is defined as 21 bss 1 model measurements 2 measurements 2 where depicts the mean of assigned value classifies the model performance based on bss in different classes i e bss 1 0 8 excellent 0 8 0 6 good 0 6 0 3 fair 0 3 0 poor and 0 bad it is shown in table s4 that the model performance based on the corresponding bss for the water level is excellent systematic velocity measurements for direct comparison with the model results are not available the excellent statistical agreement between calculated and measured water levels at all available gauges across the model domain table s4 proves the good reproduction of the tidal volume and implicitly ensures realistic flow velocities during the tidal cycle 3 2 hydrodynamic model for salinity salinity on a local scale influences the turbulence production which on a larger scale leads to baroclinic estuarine circulation due to its effect on the density the salinity distribution along the estuary varies horizontally as well as in vertical direction and time therefore a thorough reproduction of the measured salinity time series by the model ensures a realistic baroclinic circulation intensity which is also a relevant prerequisite for realistic suspended sediment and mp transport the salinity transport model is driven by boundary conditions at all open boundaries weser lesum hunte ochtum geeste and the open sea boundary see table 1 fig 8 shows the comparison between the model results and measurements for three stations around the etz as can be seen the model results agree well with the measurements regarding their phase but for the absolute values show a slightly higher longitudinal gradient as observed the statistical parameters for correlation coefficient is between 93 96 and bss varies between 0 76 0 92 which classify the model performance between good to excellent table s5 however the model is able to very well reproduce the salinity for stations rss and bhv where the baroclinic circulation is basically driven 3 3 hydrodynamic model for temperature the importance of the modelled temperature lies in the ecological submodule which computes the microalgae concentration since the algae growth is strongly dependent on temperature a realistic reproduction is important for the biofouling activity on mp see supplementary data the temperature model is driven by boundary conditions at all open boundaries weser lesum hunte ochtum geeste and the open sea boundary see table 1 as can be seen in fig 9 the model results are in good agreement with the measurements in terms of phase and absolute values the statistical parameters for correlation coefficient is between 98 99 and bss varies between 0 68 0 98 which classify the model performance between good to excellent table s6 3 4 morphodynamic model fine sediment concentrations the model results for suspended sediment concentration are compared with measurements fig 10 for three etz stations in the outer weser the model results are reasonable in comparison with measurements particularly for bhv gage station however the measured peak values are underestimated most of the time and also the characteristic spring neap cycle 14 day periodicity is not covered very well since spm concentration are very sensitive to local scale variability in sediment availability and turbulence structure it is a known difficulty in estuarine turbidity modeling to get sufficient agreement between the point measurement and the corresponding computational cell which can inevitably not consider those sub grid variabilities in turbulence and spm values another aspect here is the vertical location of the spm sensors which are all located well above the baroclinic stratification range within the water column as a result the comparison of measured and calculated spm values becomes strongly dependent of the turbulence damping approach which inherits strongly empirical characteristics however the relevant spm concentrations for mp interaction occur in the lower water column where the calculated spm values are well above the threshold for mp sediment interaction the morphodynamic model performance could be further improved by a longer model spin up time schoellhamer et al 2008 and tweaking of the turbulence damping formulation but the achieved result is already sufficient for the use intended here the estuarine turbidity maximum is calculated at the right location and the spm concentrations are high enough to trigger the mp interaction this good qualitative agreement between model and reality also ensures realistic spatial distributions of mp the statistical parameters for correlation coefficient and bss classify the model performance as good except for that of bhv table s7 3 5 mp transport model the mp transport model is run with boundary conditions at open boundaries stations 19 and 20 for the seaside boundary and station 53 for the upstream discharge derived from roscher et al 2021 modified sources from wwtp after mintenig et al 2017 and diffusive atmospherical mp input after kernchen et al 2022 see also chapter 2 3 3 3 and table 1 initial conditions were generated by means of a one month spin up run which was initiated with a spatial interpolation of the dataset from roscher et al 2021 for the water body and halbach scholz boettcher see table 1 for the sediment bed a coarse calibration to meet at least the order of magnitude of observed mp data was possible against a subset of the roscher et al 2021 data set table 2 shows the base polymer types and corresponding properties considered in the model configuration two size classes were distinguished for each polymer type 500 Âµm small mp and 500 Âµm large mp the size classification here reflects the analytical results that were grouped into small and large mp after roscher et al 2021 the sampling stations for model validation are highlighted in fig 11 st 34 st 41 and st 45 are located inside the etz due to higher fine sediment concentrations in the etz these help to evaluate the performance of the described approach for mp fine sediment interaction the model here shows good qualitative agreement w r t significantly increased mp occurrence within the etz as is also reported by roscher et al 2021 fig 12 shows the model validation with the py gc ms results which are methodically completely independent of the calibration and boundary condition data the model reproduces the order of magnitude of the direct measurements with good accuracy this applies even more given the little available calibration data and resulting coarse calibration the model results were taken from the same time frames and also from the water depths as the water samples were taken the good reproduction of mp concentrations compared with the measurements in fig 12 the corresponding values are listed in table 3 is a result of the described deterministic model approach the statistical analysis of the model results in table 3 reveals that the model results are generally over estimated all mean 0 where model results plawes campaign moreover the model shows an excellent performance for c ps bss 0 96 c pc bss 0 81 and c pmma bss 0 89 good for c pet bss 0 67 fair for c pe bss 0 42 c pvc bss 0 32 and bad for c pp bss 0 33 c mdi pur bss 2 25 the overall bss of the model results is 0 69 which classifies the model performance as good a possible explanation for the c mdi pur result is given in the discussion further below the spatial mp distribution and transport are strongly coupled with the estuarine hydro and sediment dynamics as a result the model achieves a good overall distribution even with little mp boundary data availability as is the case with this investigation despite the good overall agreement significant deviations for some polymer types at some locations can be observed mdi pur for example is measured only at stations 45 brk and 34 bhv there is some indication that the modelled pur source is mdi pur which is highly source adherent this has to be confirmed by further analysis and would probably require additional process description for mdi pur polymer in the model however two significant points have to be made here despite huge efforts in sampling and lab analyses for mp loads the available data is still very limited and significantly more data would be necessary to allow a thorough calibration and have robust model results moreover the need to convert particle numbers and averaged particle dimensions into mp mass introduces severe uncertainties as also discussed by primpke et al 2021 the aforementioned points are the reason to consider this investigation merely as an exemplary showcase for the general feasibility of the presented type of model approach a model validation was done with a second and independent plawes data set it is extracted from a larger data set halbach scholz bÃ¶ttcher to be published elsewhere and refers to respective polymer type clusters each of which can be traced back to a base polymer type the advantage of py gc ms results clearly is their direct measurement of mp masses which makes the particle count to mass conversion step unnecessary and avoids the additional uncertainty introduced by the required assumptions see also chapter 2 3 3 3 the presented dataset covers only the size fraction smaller 500 Âµm for selected sampling locations in and around the etz fig 11 in the light of the poor overall data density and the coarse calibration it makes no sense to further discuss the specific deviations between model and measurements here instead the reader should realize that the model approach presented in this study allows very specific identification of existing data shortages with respect to location mp polymer type and physical process formulation fig 13 a h shows 28 days averaged spatial distribution of the surface water mp concentration since the model distinguishes between several polymer types and size classes table 2 with different transport properties the time averaged spatial distribution is shown separately for each polymer type the highest concentrations are generally found in and around the etz between brk and bhv locations see fig 6 which is in good agreement with the observations as an example the distributions of pp and pc show significant differences regarding their time averaged spatial distribution because of their different physical properties and also their availability in the model boundaries and sources pc is significantly denser then pp which lets pc particles settle fast while pp is negatively buoyant and is therefore dominantly transported in the upper water column at least as biofouling in the outer estuary is weak and did not force the pp particles to settle as an exemplary qualitative result one can assume that pp particles easier leave the estuarine zone towards the open sea than pc particles do it also becomes clear that the etz strongly aggregates mp in the high concentrated mud suspension and bottom sediment which serves as a mp sink with respect to the water body as pur so far is modelled without any source adherence the calculated spatial spreading might be far too strong further need for improvement is given for the mp sources that contribute mp into the estuary this for now applies to wwtps and atmospheric deposition on the one hand possibly relevant sources are not yet included e g mp input from dewatering of the hinterland tire wear and on the other hand the available measurements from literature and also from plawes are more or less spot samples that had to be extended to larger time frames as well as a multitude of specific source locations as the result of this investigation shows this might already work as input for some general model runs but definitely does not allows robust results e g to base regulations or management options or assessments on them a comprehensive long term monitoring program for mp measurements is strongly envisaged it could start for the tidal reach of the river weser and be extended to other parts of the coastline if necessary it should include all wwtp effluents and dewatering inflows as well as atmospheric deposition along the weser river the main aim should be to elucidate the corresponding contribution of those sources in parallel the transferability of this data to other estuaries should be checked in the light of the excessive efforts for sample analyses the combination of model results and targeted sampling and analysis seems as a promising approach to purposefully optimize sampling campaigns and also improve the system understanding by further model result validation this mutual dependency should be considered for any further research of mp pollution on larger spatial scales 4 summary and conclusion this paper presents a numerical model approach to study the transport and accumulation of mp in rivers the hydrodynamic model formulation is suited for virtually all water bodies up to partially stratified estuaries the paper shows an exemplary model application for the tidal influenced part of the river weser and its estuary model development and application were carried out within the project framework of plawes which covered the whole weser catchment and dealt with mp sample analyses modeling and other mostly process based developments for the tidal region it was hypothesized that mp to a certain extent would become part of the complex estuarine dynamics especially the large scale baroclinic circulation and in term of interaction with suspended fine sediments which accumulate in the estuarine turbidity zone and exhibit complex flocculation and hindered settling behavior therefore the mp transport model requires a fully coupled three dimensional hydro morphodynamic estuarine model as an important prerequisite the mp transport also considers biofouling of mp particles which also requires a simplified water quality model for micro algae since the presence of mp does by no means influence the hydro and morphodynamic situation the mp transport model can be executed in a post processing step after the hydro morphodynamical model run the mp transport model is implemented based on convection diffusion type equations it considers several mp polymer types and their particle size classes the deterministic approach includes interaction with the estuarine processes on different levels the dominant governing process for the mp here is the settling velocity formulation which considers mp particles as either inert or part of sediment aggregates which form by means of flocculation and aggregation processes and also hindered settling also biofouling is included in terms of settling velocity formulation furthermore mp sedimentation erosion and resuspension are considered to run the model initial and boundary conditions are needed and as far as mp is concerned this draws relevant constraints on the model application so far since measured data are hardly available therefore besides Âµftir data analyzed within plawes literature values had to be used to estimate initial and boundary conditions and additional mp sources the available data allowed a coarse calibration of the mp transport model which leads to good results that could also be validated by means of the first exemplary data of a more comprehensive py gc ms dataset to be published elsewhere the good overall agreement between model and data is a result of the strongly deterministic character of the mp binding to the estuarine processes nonetheless the sparse available input data renders the application shown here merely as an exemplary showcase for the general feasibility of the presented type of model approach the definite conclusion at the present time is that the model can contribute to an efficient as well as organized campaign measurements therefore a combination of both provides much more progress than each of them separately the model approach is suited to consistently extend the point measurements into the complete model area and provides a powerful aid towards better system understanding also the model allows to increase the representativeness of the point measurements which can be considered as a spotlight within a significantly dynamic system by means of time averaging the model results the results clearly show that the combination of both model application and improvement as well as targeted measurements provides much more progress for further improvement of system understanding compared to each of them separately a suggestion for a long term monitoring and analysis program is given
