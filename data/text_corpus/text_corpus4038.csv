20190,due to the unobserved heterogeneity inherent in the severity data of maritime accidents traditional methods used to investigate the severity of maritime accidents always result in hiding some underlying relationships this paper proposes a methodology for analysing the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents from an emergency response perspective a two step clustering method is first used to classify maritime accidents into two homogeneous clusters subsequently multinomial ordered logit models are developed for each cluster to analyse the unobserved heterogeneity that affects the severity of the three accident consequences ship damage casualties and environmental damage analyses are performed based on data collected from china s maritime safety administration reports on maritime accidents that occurred in sea lanes of the country s maritime transportation system the model estimation results indicate that a wide spectrum of factors affect the severity of accident consequences including natural environmental factors ship characteristics accident characteristics and rescue conditions however the factors have different effects on the severity of accident consequences furthermore variations in estimated coefficients across clusters reveal unobserved heterogeneity the proposed methodology can effectively explore the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents and the results provide a decision making strategy in maritime emergency rescue measures keywords accident severity two step clustering multinomial ordered logit unobserved heterogeneity sea lanes 1 introduction maritime transportation has the advantages of providing cheaper and greener services than other transport modes and is vital for national economic development with the continuous development of the international shipping industry the volume of maritime trade has greatly increased the density of ships in sea lanes has also increased and the navigation environment becomes complex leading to a high level of risk wang and yang 2018 in addition the maritime transport system is a complex system composed of multiple elements such as transportation networks ships environments and management schemes jiang and lu 2020 and sea lanes are often affected by various risk factors zhang et al 2018 wang and yang 2018 jiang and lu 2020 thus maritime accidents are not uncommon and often cause ship damage casualties environmental damage and various property losses fan et al 2020a luo and shin 2019 according to china s statistical bulletin of transportation industry development in 2019 137 maritime accidents occurred in china s waterways including inland waterways and coastal shipping and they resulted in 155 deaths from a global perspective according to the statistics of the global integrated shipping information system gisis database a total of 205 commercial ship accidents of varying severity in different sea areas around the world were reported in 2019 although the international maritime authorities have made great efforts to improve the safety of the shipping industry according to the safety and shipping review 2019 released by the u s coast guard the maritime industry saw the number of total shipping losses of vessels over 100 gt plummet during 2018 to 46 the lowest total this century the risk of accidents occurring in sea lanes still exists jiang and lu 2020 accordingly for emergency rescue decision makers a comprehensive understanding of the effects of influencing factors on the severity of maritime accidents is of great significance for emergency rescue the evolution after a maritime accident is a complicated process hansen et al 2012 wang and yang 2018 heij and knapp 2018 pitman et al 2019 it is impossible to include all the influencing factors and the interactive effects of various factors on the severity of the maritime accidents in the study as a result the effects of the various factors included in the model are not invariable for each accident that is the heterogeneity of the impact of various factors on the severity of the accident unobserved heterogeneity for example when considering the impact of time on the severity of maritime accidents for accidents that all occur at night due to differences in the anti risk ability of each ship the maritime conditions at the time of occurrence the different rescue capabilities at its location and so on there must be differences in the severity of the final accident consequences therefore this paper aims to develop a cluster based multinomial ordered logit data mining model to analyse the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents this model could effectively reduce the unobserved heterogeneity and it includes the following two objectives 1 analysis and extraction of the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents from the accident investigation report issued by the china maritime safety administration 2 development of a cluster based multinomial ordered logit model for analysing the severity of maritime accidents to achieve the above objectives the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the next section reviews the earlier studies on maritime accident severity in section 3 we briefly describe the utilized data source and data processing effort section 4 elaborates on the proposed model followed by detailed estimation results and interpretation of the estimated parameters in section 5 conclusions and future work are discussed in section 6 2 literature review maritime accidents refer to unexpected and abnormal events involving ships luo and shin 2019 there are many factors that cause accidents at sea including human factors equipment factors environmental factors etc reviewing the previous studies although the perspectives of the studies are different there exist some common factors that affect the occurrence of maritime accidents or may contribute to different severity which are summarized in table 1 some of these factors contribute to the analysis of the influencing factors in this study at present many agencies have performed statistical analyses of maritime accidents in their reports and databases which provides convenience for the study of maritime accidents including the european maritime safety agency emsa the us coast guard the transportation safety board of canada tsbc the global integrated shipping information system gisis the international shipping facts and figures and the lloyd s list intelligence heij et al 2013 weng and yang 2015 weng et al 2018a uğurlu et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 depending on maritime accident data numerous methods have previously been used to study the severity of maritime accidents from different perspectives for example fiskin et al 2020 used decision trees and logistic regression to analyse the severity of tugboat accidents rezaee et al 2016 used logistic regression to explore the influence of weather factors on the severity of fishing vessel incidents and concluded that ice concentration wind speed sea surface temperature and darkness were the most important environmental factors associated with the severity level of fishing vessel incidents chen et al 2019 used an improved entropy weight topsis model to analyse and evaluate data on the total loss maritime accidents that occurred in the world from 1998 to 2018 and identified the main influential factors foundering stranding and fires explosions takemoto et al 2016 examined the severity of ship collisions with numerical value using a human reliability analysis method liu and frangopol 2018 presented a methodology for preliminary risk and sustainability assessment of ship grounding damage erol et al 2018 analysed accidents that occurred in the istanbul strait by using a method based on neuro fuzzy and genetically optimized fuzzy classifiers and found that accident severity increases when poor weather conditions prevail in the strait regardless of ship size however due to the heterogeneity arising from the unobserved factors in the accident data contributing factors may have different effects on the severity of accident consequences for instance weng and yang 2015 evaluated the severity of accidents and found that the ship type variable was abandoned because of insufficient explanation of the corresponding variable while wang and yang 2018 found that the ship type had a significant impact on the severity of an accident especially for fishing ships to reduce the influence of heterogeneity some studies focus on a specific characteristic for example focus on specific accident types weng et al 2018b youssef and paik 2018 baalisampang et al 2018 specific ship types talley et al 2006 2008 li and huang 2012 roberts et al 2013 jin 2014 yip et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 navas de maya and kurt 2020 çakır et al 2021 human factors antão and soares 2019 galieriková 2019 qiao et al 2020a 2020b or weather factors wu et al 2009 rezaee et al 2016 ventikos et al 2018 fiskin et al 2020 etc however analyses based on specific characteristics cannot guarantee the maximum homogeneity of the selected accident data therefore it has little effect on reducing unobserved heterogeneity data mining techniques such as cluster analysis have been used to identify homogeneous clusters and reduce data heterogeneity in particular combining the logit model can be used for influence factor analysis with good performance chang et al 2019 currently the cluster based logit model has a wealth of applications in the field of traffic accidents liu and fan 2020 however the use of this data mining approach in maritime accident data analysis is scant a novelty of this study uses a cluster based logit model to analyse the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents furthermore previous studies of maritime accidents from an emergency response perspective have not been numerous focusing mainly on the impact of influencing factors on the implementation of search and rescue missions sonninen and goerlandt 2015 stoddard and pelot 2020 this study pays more attention to the changes in the situation of the accident itself after a maritime accident i e the different severity that may be caused in addition the accident investigation reports summarized by the maritime rescue departments contain a wealth of information about the entire process of the accident that cannot be easily obtained from existing databases therefore another novelty of this study is to obtain the original data directly from the accident investigation report issued by the emergency rescue department and its attempt to analyse the factors that affect the severity of maritime accidents from an emergency response perspective 3 data collection and processing the data used in this study are derived from 459 investigation reports of accidents that occurred in sea lanes of china s maritime transportation system from 2014 to 2020 these reports were prepared by china s maritime emergency rescue agency based on the handling of the accident and then published on the website of the china maritime safety administration for a summary analysis of accidents that occurred in sea lanes to prevent the reoccurrence of similar accidents 1 1 source https www msa gov cn html hxaq sgjx index html these reports record the entire accident process from the cause to the development and final consequence of each accident and cover all the common accident types and characteristics in sea lanes of china s maritime transportation system each report includes a description of the time of the accident ship s condition conditions of the people on board navigational environment weather conditions rescue conditions and consequences of the accident based on the above reports this paper extracted the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents and the information of accident consequences by referring to the previous research expertise and available experience e g mullai and paulsson 2011 weng et al 2018b wang and yang 2018 fan et al 2020a the specific selected independent variables and classified statistics are shown in table 2 it should be noted that we describe each category of each variable in table 2 for the convenience of subsequent comparative analysis except for the no of people involved variable which is treated as a continuous variable with regard to the classification of variables the time of the accident is divided into two categories the daytime period 07 00 19 00 and night time period 19 00 07 00 it should be pointed out that the times of the daytime period and night time period change with the seasons since sea waves are mainly caused by wind we adopt the unified interval scale to measure wind and waves at the time of the accident according to the beaufort scale 2 2 the beaufort scale is a wind class determined by francis beaufort in 1805 according to the degree of wind impact on ground objects or the sea surface it is still used in sailing to describe different wind speeds visibility is stated as good and poor in the accident reports so this paper is divided into two categories according to the statements in the reports the navigational environment and ship density at the time of the accident are divided into two categories according to the statements in the reports where the navigational environment refers to the navigational geographical environment and ship density refers to the number of ships sailing nearby the types of accidents and types of ships are classified based on references weng et al 2018 wang and yang 2018 and the reports issued by the european maritime safety administration emsa 2018 for details of the classification of ship types see appendix a a centroid clustering algorithm centroid clustering i e k means clustering the goal is to find the cluster centers and assign the objects to the nearest cluster centers in order to minimize the squared distance from the category means the iteration is terminated by repeated iterations until a preset maximum value is arrived at is used to determine the optimal number of categories for the ship s gross tonnage the number of people on board the arrival time of the rescue force and the number of rescue forces dispatched and then divide them into different categories weng and yang 2015 the arrival time of the rescue force refers to the time when the rescue force arrives at the accident location after receiving a rescue message and the number of rescue forces dispatched refers to the number of coordinated rescue forces such as the number of rescue ships dispatched by the rescue agency and the number of nearby ships participating in the rescue in addition for the variable involving the number of ships it is common to involve one or two ships therefore we divide it into two categories greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1 fig 1 presents the distribution of each categorical variable in the statistics among the accident types as found by wang and yang 2018 the highest proportion of collisions is shown which is currently a common accident type in china s sea lanes about the statistical characteristics of variable data fig 2 presents the means and standard deviations of the number of accidents with different classifications for the wind and wave variable in the collected data it shows that wind and waves occur most frequently in the range 4 6 the means and standard deviations of the other variables are presented in table 2 regarding the severity the consequences of each accident can be classified as a maritime incident a less serious accident a serious accident or a very serious accident according to the regulations on the statistics of water transportation accidents of the ministry of transport of china see appendix b the accident consequences recorded in the accident report of this study are mainly divided into three aspects ship damage casualties and environmental damage therefore in this study the severity of the consequences of the three accidents are divided into the four orderly levels mentioned above among which ship damage and casualties are described in detail in the reports and environmental damage is measured by oil spills fig 3 presents the statistics of the severity of the three accident consequences sorted out from the accident report for ship damage very serious accounted for the most 36 38 and serious accounted for the least 15 26 for casualties maritime incidents accounted for the most 43 78 less serious accidents accounted for the least 9 59 and for environmental damage maritime incidents accounted for the most 48 37 and very serious 3 05 these results show the difference in the severity of the consequences of different accidents in the subsequent quantitative analysis the severity of the accident is defined as a dependent variable and the variables that affect the severity of the accident extracted from the accident report in table 2 are used as independent variables 4 modelling approach 4 1 two step clustering to better capture the unobserved heterogeneity of the influence of factors on the severity of maritime accidents this study applies a two step clustering algorithm to analyse maritime accident severity cluster analysis is one of the most widely used methods in data mining applications to achieve maximum homogeneity within clusters and maximum heterogeneity between clusters by comparing and analysing the correlation information between datasets the two step clustering algorithm used in this study is a hierarchical clustering algorithm compared with other clustering algorithms it is able to simultaneously deal with both discrete and continuous variables presents a faster convergence speed than other techniques and is able to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters chiu et al 2001 the first step of the two step clustering algorithm is the pre clustering stage the data points in the dataset are read one by one based on the ideas of the balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies birch algorithm zhang et al 1997 and the data points in a dense area are clustered in advance to form a number of sub clusters the algorithm is based on the log likelihood distance measurement to decide whether a data point should be merged with a previously formed cluster or should stand alone as a new cluster the log likelihood distance d c c between any pair of clusters c c is formulated as follows chiu et al 2001 1 d c c ζ c ζ c ζ c c where 2 ζ k n k 1 2 a 1 a log σ ˆ k a 2 σ ˆ a 2 b 1 b e ˆ k b 3 e ˆ k b l 1 l b n k b l n k log n k b l n k where k c c n k is the number of all variables in cluster k a and b are the total number of all continuous and discrete variables respectively σ ˆ k a 2 is the estimated variances of the a th continuous variables in cluster k σ ˆ a 2 is the estimated variances of the a th continuous variables in the dataset l b is the total number of categories for the b th discrete variable and n k b l is the total number of observations in cluster k in which the b th categorical variable corresponds to the l th category the second step is the clustering stage the sub clusters obtained in the pre clustering stage are used as input and the two sub clusters with the minimum log likelihood distance among these sub clusters are merged into one cluster at this point the overall number of clusters is reduced by one and then continue to merge the remaining two sub clusters with the minimum log likelihood distance until all sub clusters are merged the two step clustering algorithm can automatically determine the optimal number of clusters based on the bayesian information criterion bic the bic calculation formula for j cluster division schemes is as follows 4 bic j 2 j 1 j ζ j m j log n where 5 m j j 2 a b 1 b l b 1 where n is the number of all variables and other variables are similar to the definitions of the variables in formulas 1 2 and 3 let d bic j bic j bic j 1 which denotes the difference between j clustering scheme and j 1 clustering scheme in addition then 6 r 1 j d bic j d bic 1 where r 1 j is the degree of change of d bic j relative to d bic 1 if d bic 1 0 then the number of clusters is set to 1 otherwise let the preliminary estimate of the number of clusters z be equal to the minimum j when the ratio r 1 j is smaller than 0 04 then the following is calculated 7 r 2 z d min c z d min c z 1 where c z is the division scheme with the number of clusters z d min c z is the distance between the two clusters with the minimum log likelihood distance in the scheme c z in the same way r 2 z 1 r 2 z 2 r 2 2 can be calculated to get a ratio sequence and then find the two maximum ratios r 2 p and r 2 q from them where p and q are the number of clusters the optimal number of clusters can be determined by the following formula 8 p if r 2 p r 2 q 1 15 max p q otherwise 4 2 multinomial ordered logit the multinomial ordered logit model is a discrete choice model used to study the effects of different influencing factors on ordered multi categorical variables as mentioned earlier we consider the three consequence variables of ship damage casualties and environmental damage which represent the likelihood of the consequences of an accident to analyse an accident severity the likelihood of each accident consequence is divided into orderly four levels according to the severity of the accident as each result dependent variable has an ordered multiple classification the multinomial ordered logit model can be used for modelling analysis the latent accident severity measure is obtained by using a linear equation 9 y i β x i ε i where y i is an unobserved continuous latent variable used to measure the severity of the accident i β is the vector of estimable coefficients corresponding to the vector of exploratory variables x i and the error term ε i indicates the effect of all unobserved variables on y i due to the fact that it is difficult to observe the accident severity exactly by using the variable y i it is necessary to create an observed and coded discrete variable y i based on the latent variable y i which is shown below 10 y i 1 maritime incident if y i α 1 2 less serious if α 1 y i α 2 3 serious if α 2 y i α 3 4 very serious if α 3 y i where α 1 α 2 and α 3 is the thresholds for accident severity to be estimated along with the coefficient vector β if ε i is logit distribution then a multinomial ordered logit model related to the influencing factors and accident severity can be obtained through logit transformation and it can usually be described by the following cumulative probability formula chen et al 2020 11 logit p y i j ln p y j 1 p y j α j β x i where j 1 2 3 4 is accident severity level after the regression coefficient is obtained the cumulative probability of the occurrence of a particular situation can be obtained by the following formula 12 p y i j 1 1 exp α j β x i then the probability of each accident severity level can be expressed as follows 13 p y i j p y i j p y i j 1 furthermore the parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood function the specific formulas are as follows 14 l j 1 j i 1 i f α j 1 β i t x i f α j β i t x i w i j where j is the total number of categories i is the total number of observations w i j is equal to one if x i belongs to category j and zero otherwise it should be noted that the multinomial ordered logit model can be expressed as a joint form of the j 1 binary logit models for j dependent variable levels and the regression coefficient in the equation remains unchanged in addition for the regression coefficient β if the independent variable is a categorical variable in table 2 we have coded each category of each variable as a binary categorical variable then the positive sign indicates that relative to its reference category the effect on the dependent variable is more likely to have a higher severity level while the negative sign is just the opposite if the independent variable is a continuous variable then a positive estimated coefficient means that as the value of the variable increases the likelihood of the dependent variable becoming a higher severity level increases while the negative sign is just the opposite 4 3 marginal effects and goodness of fit measures to evaluate the effects of significant variables in the cluster based multinomial ordered logit model on the accident severity probabilities a marginal effect analysis is conducted washington et al 2010 for continuous variables the marginal effect represents change in the probability of the result with respect to a unit change in that variable while the marginal effect of the binary indicator represents the probability change of the independent variable from the encoded dummy variable 0 to 1 the marginal effects of these two variables can be calculated using equations 15 and 16 respectively 15 δ j x j i r p y j x j i r 16 δ x j i r p j i p j i x j i r 1 p j i x j i r 0 where δ j x j i r is the marginal effect of continuous variables with accident severity level j δ x j i r p j i is the marginal effect of binary variables x j i r is the r th influence variable of the i th accident with the j th severity level the marginal effect of each variable is calculated by averaging the marginal effects over all observations further to assess the fit of the estimated models and generally the goodness of fit of the multinomial ordered logit model is verified by mcfadden s r squared 17 r 2 1 l l β l l 0 where l l β is the log likelihood at convergence and l l 0 is log likelihood at zero 5 estimation results and discussion 5 1 clustering results and analysis maritime accident severity data is divided into different clusters by using a two step clustering algorithm according to all the variables mentioned in table 2 the two step clustering algorithm is implemented in python and applied using a 10 noise allowance finally two clusters are obtained from the analysis the statistical results and centroid of each cluster are shown in table 3 according to the variables with significant influence on clustering listed in table 3 except for the ship type variable there are obvious distinctions indicating that the two clusters are well distinguished in cluster 1 it mainly describes the few ship density small wind and waves good navigation environment and accidents that mainly occur in the daytime while cluster 2 mainly describes the large density ships slightly larger wind and waves than cluster 1 poor navigation environment and accidents occur during the night furthermore from the perspective of two continuous variables in the subsequent multinomial ordered logit analysis these two variables are discretized according to table 2 involving the number of ships and the gross tonnage of ships cluster 1 describes the occurrence of accidents involving few ships and the gross tonnage of ships is not large while cluster 2 is the opposite of cluster 1 the variables in the cluster are not correlated with the significant variables that affect the severity of the accident the effect of specific factors on the severity of the accident needs to be analysed by the following multinomial ordered logit 5 2 multinomial ordered logit results and analysis for each cluster in table 3 a multinomial ordered logit model of accident severity is estimated and an aggregate model is also estimated for the non clustered dataset the forward selection technique is used to select the explanatory independent variables that should be included in the logit regression model this technique starts with calculating the t statistics of each independent variable and then compares the p values of these t statistics with a preset threshold set to 0 10 in this paper if no p value is greater than the threshold the selection will stop otherwise this method will add the variable with the largest absolute t statistic to the model the method will continue calculating the t statistic of the variables still remaining outside the model and repeat the evaluation process using this method variables will be added to the model one by one until no remaining variables produce a significant t statistic weng and yang 2015 the statistically significant variables are presented in tables 4 6 coef is the abbreviation of coefficients and t stat is the abbreviation of t statistics it should be pointed out that the independent variable whose dummy variable is 0 in table 2 is set as the reference item and the dependent variable is the highest level of severity as its reference item very serious a significant finding from tables 4 6 is that the magnitudes signs and significance levels of the estimable independent variable coefficients are greatly different across clusters and this finding confirms the existence of heterogeneity in the influence of factors on the severity of maritime accidents across clusters for instance the sign of the fire explosion indicator is positive in cluster 1 of ship damage consequences which means that the occurrence of a fire explosion accident increases the probability that the ship damage tends to be a higher severity level compared to that of other types however the sign of the variable coefficient in cluster 2 is negative indicating that the occurrence of a fire explosion accident increases the probability of ship damage tends to be a lower severity compared to that of other types a similar situation can also be found in the estimated results of casualty consequences and environmental damage consequences in tables 5 and 6 in addition comparing the estimated results of a cluster based model and an aggregate model we can find that the cluster based model could mine the hidden information for example table 4 shows that according to the aggregate model indicator gross tonnage 500 is not significant but in cluster 1 the indicator sign shows as positive indicating that the occurrence of this indicator will increase the probability of ship damage tends to a higher severity level while in cluster 2 the indicator sign shows as negative indicating that the occurrence of the indicator is will not increase the probability of the ship damage tend to a higher severity level similarly the indicator navigational environment poor in table 5 has a significant effect in the aggregate model although it is not significant in clusters 1 and 2 in both examples the cluster based models reveal a more complete interpretation and effectively reduce heterogeneity another significant finding is that different influencing factors have different effects on the consequences of the three accidents which indicates that if the severity analysis is carried out from the perspective of the overall consequences it is difficult to identify the respective characteristics that affect the severity of each accident consequence for example the time of day night indicator has a significant effect on the severity estimation of the ship damage and casualties while it is not significant in the estimation of the severity of the environmental damage this finding provides an important reference for emergency rescue decision makers to formulate relevant emergency rescue plans 5 2 1 estimation results and analysis of ship damage severity table 4 presents the results of the multinomial ordered model for ship damage severity based on the estimated results in the table and formulas 10 13 the final regression equations can be derived as shown in table 4 1 in appendix c according to the table the fishing ship accidents are closely related to the severity of the ship damage and have significant effects in clusters 1 and 2 which may be related to the severity of fishing ship accidents that are easily affected by influencing factors jin 2014 rezaee et al 2016 bye and aalberg 2018 simultaneously it can be found that the signs of the ship type fishing ship in cluster 1 and cluster 2 are opposite which also shows that cluster analyses can maximize the heterogeneity between clusters in addition the signs of the time of day night and wind and waves 7 8 in cluster 2 are all positive indicating that they have a positive effect on the severity level of ship damage tending to be higher which is in line with the previous studies that the poor natural environment has a greater effect on the severity of ship damage weng and yang 2015 erol et al 2018 wang and yang 2018 ventikos et al 2018 we also found that the sinking accident in cluster 1 has the greatest effect on the severity of ship damage compared to other accident types further by comparing the coefficients of gross tonnage 500 and gross tonnage 10000 in cluster 1 we can find that although both of them have a positive effect on the severity of ship damage tending to a higher level it seems that the indicator gross tonnage 500 has a stronger effect than gross tonnage 10000 that is to say compared with a reference of less than 500 gross tonnages and a reference of less than 10 000 gross tonnages the former shows this effect more strongly in terms of rescue table 4 reveals that the shorter the arrival time of the rescue force is the lower the severity of the final accident consequences which is consistent with our cognition in addition more rescue forces dispatched corresponds to a higher severity of ship damage but the severity of ship damage will not increase equally with the increase in the number of rescue forces for example in cluster 2 the coefficient of no of rescue forces dispatched 10 is greater than the coefficient of no of rescue forces dispatched 20 in other words when the severity of the ship damage reaches the maximum there may be people involved in danger and need to dispatch rescue forces to participate in the rescue currently the severity of the ship damage will not increase but the number of rescue forces dispatched will increase compared to previous studies some common important factors are identified to have an effect on accident severity for example for accident type talley et al 2008 identified a significant positive effect of explosion accidents on cruise ship accident severity compared to other accident types and the estimation results in cluster 1 of this study also show that fire explosion accidents significantly affect ship damage severity compared to other accident types however it should be noted that talley et al 2008 is for the cruise ship accident characteristic conditions while this study is for the cluster 1 characteristic conditions furthermore some other factors have been demonstrated in previous studies to affect the severity of ship damage such as collisions çakır et al 2021 grounding and wind strike wang and yang 2018 this study also shows a significant effect on ship damage under different clustering characteristics 5 2 2 estimation results and analysis of casualty severity table 5 presents the results of the multinomial ordered model for casualty severity based on the estimated results in the table and formulas 10 13 the final regression equations can be derived as shown in table 5 1 in appendix c according to the results wind and waves have a significant effect on the severity of casualty and this finding is in line with that of wang and yang 2018 based on the results of cluster 2 in table 5 the higher the scales of wind and waves are the greater the potential for casualties compared with the 0 6 scales for the types of accidents in accordance with weng et al 2018a and chen et al 2020 collisions are more likely to increase the severity of casualties than other types for ship types fishing ships are more likely to increase the severity of casualties in addition the coefficient sign of the gross tonnage 500 indicator in cluster 1 is negative indicating that it will not make the severity of casualties tend to be higher level which is contrary to its effect on the severity of ship damage as expected from the estimated results of the indicators no of people and no of people involved in cluster 1 we found that more people on board and involved are more likely to lead to very serious casualties in terms of rescue based on the estimated results of the ship density many indicator in cluster 2 we found that when an accident occurs more ships are usually in the vicinity which can reduce the severity of casualties this can be attributed to china s rescue mechanism after an accident occurs at sea china s corresponding rescue agency will first coordinate the surrounding navigation ships to participate in the rescue similar to the results of the severity of ship damage we found from the estimation results of the time of rescue force arrival indicator of cluster 1 and cluster 2 that the shorter the rescue arrival time the more favourable the severity of casualties tends to be lower in addition the no of rescue forces dispatched indicator estimation result in cluster 1 shows that the more rescue forces are dispatched the greater the probability of casualties some of the previously studied variables that had a significant effect on the severity of casualties are also confirmed in this study for example the estimation results in cluster 2 show that the time of the accident at night positively affects the severity of casualties this result coincides with the studies of weng and yang 2015 and weng et al 2018a in cluster 2 of this study it is revealed that poor visibility can increase the severity of casualties compared to good visibility similarly pitman et al 2019 suggested that poor visibility increases the severity of casualties 5 2 3 estimation results and analysis of environmental damage severity table 6 presents the results of the multinomial ordered model for environmental damage severity based on the estimated results in the table and formulas 10 13 the final regression equations can be derived as shown in table 6 1 in appendix c according to the estimation results of the indicators visibility poor and navigational environment poor in cluster 1 the signs of the coefficients are all positive which shows that poor visibility and the navigation environment at the time of the accident may eventually lead to a higher severity level of environmental damage for the types of accidents in cluster 1 fire explosion accidents have the highest probability of serious damage to the environment followed by wind strike collision and sinking accidents in cluster 2 contact accidents have the highest environmental damage followed by fire explosion and sinking accidents for the types of ships we found that both liquid cargo ships and fishing ships have a significant effect on the severity of environmental damage however in cluster 2 the estimated coefficient sign of the ship type liquid cargo ship indicator is positive while the estimated coefficient sign of the ship type fishing ship indicator is negative indicating that the two indicators have the opposite effect on the severity of environmental damage that is compared with other types of ships when a liquid cargo ship has an accident it is more likely to increase the severity level of environmental damage while fishing ships present the opposite trend furthermore when the number of ships involved is greater than 1 then serious environmental damage is likely to occur one possible reason is that the more ships that are involved the higher the severity of an accident in terms of rescue the results in cluster 2 show that a rescue time of less than or equal to 0 5 h will reduce the probability of very serious environmental damage compared to a rescue time of more than 0 5 h in addition the negative estimated coefficient of the time of rescue force arrival 1 indicator in cluster 2 has a smaller value for environmental damage than for ship damage and casualties indicating that the severity of environmental damage is more sensitive to the rescue force arrival time cakir et al 2021 studied the severity of oil spills and revealed that accident type and ship type were the most important factors affecting the severity of oil spills in this study we also found that different accident types and ship types have significant effects on the severity of oil spills in addition the results of shi et al 2019 on the assessment of oil spill severity showed that ships with gross tonnage over 30 000 tonnes increase the oil spill severity compared to those below 30 000 tonnes in contrast the estimation results of cluster 2 in this study reveal that oil spill severity decreases for ships with gross tonnage greater than or equal to 500 compared to ships with gross tonnage less than 500 in the last part of this section we compare the goodness of fit between the aggregate model and the cluster based model the specific results are shown in table 7 according to the likelihood ratio calculation formula l r 2 l l β a g g r e g a t e k 1 2 l l β c l u s t e r k the calculated likelihood ratio results of the three accident consequences are 289 28 219 98 and 313 36 respectively compared with the 99 confidence level and the chi square critical value for 52 degrees of freedom the three results are all greater than the chi square critical value 78 62 indicating that the cluster based model is superior to the aggregate model in addition based on the values of mcfadden s r squared each model has a better fitting effect 5 3 marginal effect analysis in this section a marginal effect analysis is carried out to better explain the severity of estimated accident results as providing the marginal effects of all variables in the models would not be of much benefit we focus only on important and representative variables for the marginal effect analysis as an example the accident type collision variables that have a significant influence in cluster 1 are selected for the marginal effect analysis as shown in fig 4 this figure shows that compared with that of other types of accidents the occurrence of collision accidents dummy indicator changes from zero to one will increase the probability of the very serious consequences of ship damage casualties and environmental damage by 14 25 10 44 and 19 44 respectively showing that this variable is more sensitive to the very serious of environmental damage in addition to the maritime incident level the probability of other severity levels also increased to different degrees in addition a critical aspect that affects the severity of maritime accidents is the rescue conditions as shown in fig 5 the indicator time of rescue force arrival 1 is used as an example to calculate the marginal effect of the severity level of each accident consequence in each cluster when the dummy indicator changes from zero to one the probability of a very serious is significantly reduced indicating that a rescue force arrival time of less than or equal to 1 hour will reduce the likelihood of a very serious accident furthermore the range of marginal effect changes in the likelihood of the accident severity varies across clusters indicating the heterogeneity in the influence of different cluster accidents 6 conclusions in this study from the perspective of maritime emergency rescue we extracted useful information that affects the severity of maritime accidents from investigation reports of accidents that occurred in the sea lanes of china s maritime transportation system issued by the china maritime safety administration and used a cluster based multinomial ordered logit model to analyse the severity of maritime accidents from three aspects ship damage casualties and environmental damage from the analysis useful insights are obtained as follows 1 many factors affect the severity of maritime accidents including natural factors e g wind and waves navigation environment and visibility ship factors e g ship type gross tonnage and number of people on board accident factors e g time of accident type of accident and number of people involved rescue factors e g rescue arrival time number of rescue forces dispatched and ship density 2 the variations in signs and magnitudes of the estimated coefficients across clusters confirm the existence of the heterogeneity in the dataset that if ignored leads to inconsistent estimates 3 there are differences in the factors that affect the severity of the three accident consequences and the development of models separately can effectively dig out their respective characteristics 4 the cluster based multinomial ordered logit model can effectively mine the factors that affect the severity of maritime accidents and reduce the unobserved heterogeneity the above insights provide a reference for emergency rescue decision making and plan formulation this study is limited by the information contained in the accident reports which do not contain certain information such as the ship age and flag which may affect the severity of an accident this aspect is where future research needs to be improved in addition this paper takes a chinese case as an example and whether similar situations in the other waters in the world have yet to be confirmed by further research based on this study further research perspectives can be used to explore the relationship between influencing factors and the severity of maritime accidents based on clustering and other data mining methods credit authorship contribution statement baode li conceptualization

20190,due to the unobserved heterogeneity inherent in the severity data of maritime accidents traditional methods used to investigate the severity of maritime accidents always result in hiding some underlying relationships this paper proposes a methodology for analysing the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents from an emergency response perspective a two step clustering method is first used to classify maritime accidents into two homogeneous clusters subsequently multinomial ordered logit models are developed for each cluster to analyse the unobserved heterogeneity that affects the severity of the three accident consequences ship damage casualties and environmental damage analyses are performed based on data collected from china s maritime safety administration reports on maritime accidents that occurred in sea lanes of the country s maritime transportation system the model estimation results indicate that a wide spectrum of factors affect the severity of accident consequences including natural environmental factors ship characteristics accident characteristics and rescue conditions however the factors have different effects on the severity of accident consequences furthermore variations in estimated coefficients across clusters reveal unobserved heterogeneity the proposed methodology can effectively explore the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents and the results provide a decision making strategy in maritime emergency rescue measures keywords accident severity two step clustering multinomial ordered logit unobserved heterogeneity sea lanes 1 introduction maritime transportation has the advantages of providing cheaper and greener services than other transport modes and is vital for national economic development with the continuous development of the international shipping industry the volume of maritime trade has greatly increased the density of ships in sea lanes has also increased and the navigation environment becomes complex leading to a high level of risk wang and yang 2018 in addition the maritime transport system is a complex system composed of multiple elements such as transportation networks ships environments and management schemes jiang and lu 2020 and sea lanes are often affected by various risk factors zhang et al 2018 wang and yang 2018 jiang and lu 2020 thus maritime accidents are not uncommon and often cause ship damage casualties environmental damage and various property losses fan et al 2020a luo and shin 2019 according to china s statistical bulletin of transportation industry development in 2019 137 maritime accidents occurred in china s waterways including inland waterways and coastal shipping and they resulted in 155 deaths from a global perspective according to the statistics of the global integrated shipping information system gisis database a total of 205 commercial ship accidents of varying severity in different sea areas around the world were reported in 2019 although the international maritime authorities have made great efforts to improve the safety of the shipping industry according to the safety and shipping review 2019 released by the u s coast guard the maritime industry saw the number of total shipping losses of vessels over 100 gt plummet during 2018 to 46 the lowest total this century the risk of accidents occurring in sea lanes still exists jiang and lu 2020 accordingly for emergency rescue decision makers a comprehensive understanding of the effects of influencing factors on the severity of maritime accidents is of great significance for emergency rescue the evolution after a maritime accident is a complicated process hansen et al 2012 wang and yang 2018 heij and knapp 2018 pitman et al 2019 it is impossible to include all the influencing factors and the interactive effects of various factors on the severity of the maritime accidents in the study as a result the effects of the various factors included in the model are not invariable for each accident that is the heterogeneity of the impact of various factors on the severity of the accident unobserved heterogeneity for example when considering the impact of time on the severity of maritime accidents for accidents that all occur at night due to differences in the anti risk ability of each ship the maritime conditions at the time of occurrence the different rescue capabilities at its location and so on there must be differences in the severity of the final accident consequences therefore this paper aims to develop a cluster based multinomial ordered logit data mining model to analyse the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents this model could effectively reduce the unobserved heterogeneity and it includes the following two objectives 1 analysis and extraction of the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents from the accident investigation report issued by the china maritime safety administration 2 development of a cluster based multinomial ordered logit model for analysing the severity of maritime accidents to achieve the above objectives the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the next section reviews the earlier studies on maritime accident severity in section 3 we briefly describe the utilized data source and data processing effort section 4 elaborates on the proposed model followed by detailed estimation results and interpretation of the estimated parameters in section 5 conclusions and future work are discussed in section 6 2 literature review maritime accidents refer to unexpected and abnormal events involving ships luo and shin 2019 there are many factors that cause accidents at sea including human factors equipment factors environmental factors etc reviewing the previous studies although the perspectives of the studies are different there exist some common factors that affect the occurrence of maritime accidents or may contribute to different severity which are summarized in table 1 some of these factors contribute to the analysis of the influencing factors in this study at present many agencies have performed statistical analyses of maritime accidents in their reports and databases which provides convenience for the study of maritime accidents including the european maritime safety agency emsa the us coast guard the transportation safety board of canada tsbc the global integrated shipping information system gisis the international shipping facts and figures and the lloyd s list intelligence heij et al 2013 weng and yang 2015 weng et al 2018a uğurlu et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 depending on maritime accident data numerous methods have previously been used to study the severity of maritime accidents from different perspectives for example fiskin et al 2020 used decision trees and logistic regression to analyse the severity of tugboat accidents rezaee et al 2016 used logistic regression to explore the influence of weather factors on the severity of fishing vessel incidents and concluded that ice concentration wind speed sea surface temperature and darkness were the most important environmental factors associated with the severity level of fishing vessel incidents chen et al 2019 used an improved entropy weight topsis model to analyse and evaluate data on the total loss maritime accidents that occurred in the world from 1998 to 2018 and identified the main influential factors foundering stranding and fires explosions takemoto et al 2016 examined the severity of ship collisions with numerical value using a human reliability analysis method liu and frangopol 2018 presented a methodology for preliminary risk and sustainability assessment of ship grounding damage erol et al 2018 analysed accidents that occurred in the istanbul strait by using a method based on neuro fuzzy and genetically optimized fuzzy classifiers and found that accident severity increases when poor weather conditions prevail in the strait regardless of ship size however due to the heterogeneity arising from the unobserved factors in the accident data contributing factors may have different effects on the severity of accident consequences for instance weng and yang 2015 evaluated the severity of accidents and found that the ship type variable was abandoned because of insufficient explanation of the corresponding variable while wang and yang 2018 found that the ship type had a significant impact on the severity of an accident especially for fishing ships to reduce the influence of heterogeneity some studies focus on a specific characteristic for example focus on specific accident types weng et al 2018b youssef and paik 2018 baalisampang et al 2018 specific ship types talley et al 2006 2008 li and huang 2012 roberts et al 2013 jin 2014 yip et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 navas de maya and kurt 2020 çakır et al 2021 human factors antão and soares 2019 galieriková 2019 qiao et al 2020a 2020b or weather factors wu et al 2009 rezaee et al 2016 ventikos et al 2018 fiskin et al 2020 etc however analyses based on specific characteristics cannot guarantee the maximum homogeneity of the selected accident data therefore it has little effect on reducing unobserved heterogeneity data mining techniques such as cluster analysis have been used to identify homogeneous clusters and reduce data heterogeneity in particular combining the logit model can be used for influence factor analysis with good performance chang et al 2019 currently the cluster based logit model has a wealth of applications in the field of traffic accidents liu and fan 2020 however the use of this data mining approach in maritime accident data analysis is scant a novelty of this study uses a cluster based logit model to analyse the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents furthermore previous studies of maritime accidents from an emergency response perspective have not been numerous focusing mainly on the impact of influencing factors on the implementation of search and rescue missions sonninen and goerlandt 2015 stoddard and pelot 2020 this study pays more attention to the changes in the situation of the accident itself after a maritime accident i e the different severity that may be caused in addition the accident investigation reports summarized by the maritime rescue departments contain a wealth of information about the entire process of the accident that cannot be easily obtained from existing databases therefore another novelty of this study is to obtain the original data directly from the accident investigation report issued by the emergency rescue department and its attempt to analyse the factors that affect the severity of maritime accidents from an emergency response perspective 3 data collection and processing the data used in this study are derived from 459 investigation reports of accidents that occurred in sea lanes of china s maritime transportation system from 2014 to 2020 these reports were prepared by china s maritime emergency rescue agency based on the handling of the accident and then published on the website of the china maritime safety administration for a summary analysis of accidents that occurred in sea lanes to prevent the reoccurrence of similar accidents 1 1 source https www msa gov cn html hxaq sgjx index html these reports record the entire accident process from the cause to the development and final consequence of each accident and cover all the common accident types and characteristics in sea lanes of china s maritime transportation system each report includes a description of the time of the accident ship s condition conditions of the people on board navigational environment weather conditions rescue conditions and consequences of the accident based on the above reports this paper extracted the factors affecting the severity of maritime accidents and the information of accident consequences by referring to the previous research expertise and available experience e g mullai and paulsson 2011 weng et al 2018b wang and yang 2018 fan et al 2020a the specific selected independent variables and classified statistics are shown in table 2 it should be noted that we describe each category of each variable in table 2 for the convenience of subsequent comparative analysis except for the no of people involved variable which is treated as a continuous variable with regard to the classification of variables the time of the accident is divided into two categories the daytime period 07 00 19 00 and night time period 19 00 07 00 it should be pointed out that the times of the daytime period and night time period change with the seasons since sea waves are mainly caused by wind we adopt the unified interval scale to measure wind and waves at the time of the accident according to the beaufort scale 2 2 the beaufort scale is a wind class determined by francis beaufort in 1805 according to the degree of wind impact on ground objects or the sea surface it is still used in sailing to describe different wind speeds visibility is stated as good and poor in the accident reports so this paper is divided into two categories according to the statements in the reports the navigational environment and ship density at the time of the accident are divided into two categories according to the statements in the reports where the navigational environment refers to the navigational geographical environment and ship density refers to the number of ships sailing nearby the types of accidents and types of ships are classified based on references weng et al 2018 wang and yang 2018 and the reports issued by the european maritime safety administration emsa 2018 for details of the classification of ship types see appendix a a centroid clustering algorithm centroid clustering i e k means clustering the goal is to find the cluster centers and assign the objects to the nearest cluster centers in order to minimize the squared distance from the category means the iteration is terminated by repeated iterations until a preset maximum value is arrived at is used to determine the optimal number of categories for the ship s gross tonnage the number of people on board the arrival time of the rescue force and the number of rescue forces dispatched and then divide them into different categories weng and yang 2015 the arrival time of the rescue force refers to the time when the rescue force arrives at the accident location after receiving a rescue message and the number of rescue forces dispatched refers to the number of coordinated rescue forces such as the number of rescue ships dispatched by the rescue agency and the number of nearby ships participating in the rescue in addition for the variable involving the number of ships it is common to involve one or two ships therefore we divide it into two categories greater than 1 and less than or equal to 1 fig 1 presents the distribution of each categorical variable in the statistics among the accident types as found by wang and yang 2018 the highest proportion of collisions is shown which is currently a common accident type in china s sea lanes about the statistical characteristics of variable data fig 2 presents the means and standard deviations of the number of accidents with different classifications for the wind and wave variable in the collected data it shows that wind and waves occur most frequently in the range 4 6 the means and standard deviations of the other variables are presented in table 2 regarding the severity the consequences of each accident can be classified as a maritime incident a less serious accident a serious accident or a very serious accident according to the regulations on the statistics of water transportation accidents of the ministry of transport of china see appendix b the accident consequences recorded in the accident report of this study are mainly divided into three aspects ship damage casualties and environmental damage therefore in this study the severity of the consequences of the three accidents are divided into the four orderly levels mentioned above among which ship damage and casualties are described in detail in the reports and environmental damage is measured by oil spills fig 3 presents the statistics of the severity of the three accident consequences sorted out from the accident report for ship damage very serious accounted for the most 36 38 and serious accounted for the least 15 26 for casualties maritime incidents accounted for the most 43 78 less serious accidents accounted for the least 9 59 and for environmental damage maritime incidents accounted for the most 48 37 and very serious 3 05 these results show the difference in the severity of the consequences of different accidents in the subsequent quantitative analysis the severity of the accident is defined as a dependent variable and the variables that affect the severity of the accident extracted from the accident report in table 2 are used as independent variables 4 modelling approach 4 1 two step clustering to better capture the unobserved heterogeneity of the influence of factors on the severity of maritime accidents this study applies a two step clustering algorithm to analyse maritime accident severity cluster analysis is one of the most widely used methods in data mining applications to achieve maximum homogeneity within clusters and maximum heterogeneity between clusters by comparing and analysing the correlation information between datasets the two step clustering algorithm used in this study is a hierarchical clustering algorithm compared with other clustering algorithms it is able to simultaneously deal with both discrete and continuous variables presents a faster convergence speed than other techniques and is able to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters chiu et al 2001 the first step of the two step clustering algorithm is the pre clustering stage the data points in the dataset are read one by one based on the ideas of the balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies birch algorithm zhang et al 1997 and the data points in a dense area are clustered in advance to form a number of sub clusters the algorithm is based on the log likelihood distance measurement to decide whether a data point should be merged with a previously formed cluster or should stand alone as a new cluster the log likelihood distance d c c between any pair of clusters c c is formulated as follows chiu et al 2001 1 d c c ζ c ζ c ζ c c where 2 ζ k n k 1 2 a 1 a log σ ˆ k a 2 σ ˆ a 2 b 1 b e ˆ k b 3 e ˆ k b l 1 l b n k b l n k log n k b l n k where k c c n k is the number of all variables in cluster k a and b are the total number of all continuous and discrete variables respectively σ ˆ k a 2 is the estimated variances of the a th continuous variables in cluster k σ ˆ a 2 is the estimated variances of the a th continuous variables in the dataset l b is the total number of categories for the b th discrete variable and n k b l is the total number of observations in cluster k in which the b th categorical variable corresponds to the l th category the second step is the clustering stage the sub clusters obtained in the pre clustering stage are used as input and the two sub clusters with the minimum log likelihood distance among these sub clusters are merged into one cluster at this point the overall number of clusters is reduced by one and then continue to merge the remaining two sub clusters with the minimum log likelihood distance until all sub clusters are merged the two step clustering algorithm can automatically determine the optimal number of clusters based on the bayesian information criterion bic the bic calculation formula for j cluster division schemes is as follows 4 bic j 2 j 1 j ζ j m j log n where 5 m j j 2 a b 1 b l b 1 where n is the number of all variables and other variables are similar to the definitions of the variables in formulas 1 2 and 3 let d bic j bic j bic j 1 which denotes the difference between j clustering scheme and j 1 clustering scheme in addition then 6 r 1 j d bic j d bic 1 where r 1 j is the degree of change of d bic j relative to d bic 1 if d bic 1 0 then the number of clusters is set to 1 otherwise let the preliminary estimate of the number of clusters z be equal to the minimum j when the ratio r 1 j is smaller than 0 04 then the following is calculated 7 r 2 z d min c z d min c z 1 where c z is the division scheme with the number of clusters z d min c z is the distance between the two clusters with the minimum log likelihood distance in the scheme c z in the same way r 2 z 1 r 2 z 2 r 2 2 can be calculated to get a ratio sequence and then find the two maximum ratios r 2 p and r 2 q from them where p and q are the number of clusters the optimal number of clusters can be determined by the following formula 8 p if r 2 p r 2 q 1 15 max p q otherwise 4 2 multinomial ordered logit the multinomial ordered logit model is a discrete choice model used to study the effects of different influencing factors on ordered multi categorical variables as mentioned earlier we consider the three consequence variables of ship damage casualties and environmental damage which represent the likelihood of the consequences of an accident to analyse an accident severity the likelihood of each accident consequence is divided into orderly four levels according to the severity of the accident as each result dependent variable has an ordered multiple classification the multinomial ordered logit model can be used for modelling analysis the latent accident severity measure is obtained by using a linear equation 9 y i β x i ε i where y i is an unobserved continuous latent variable used to measure the severity of the accident i β is the vector of estimable coefficients corresponding to the vector of exploratory variables x i and the error term ε i indicates the effect of all unobserved variables on y i due to the fact that it is difficult to observe the accident severity exactly by using the variable y i it is necessary to create an observed and coded discrete variable y i based on the latent variable y i which is shown below 10 y i 1 maritime incident if y i α 1 2 less serious if α 1 y i α 2 3 serious if α 2 y i α 3 4 very serious if α 3 y i where α 1 α 2 and α 3 is the thresholds for accident severity to be estimated along with the coefficient vector β if ε i is logit distribution then a multinomial ordered logit model related to the influencing factors and accident severity can be obtained through logit transformation and it can usually be described by the following cumulative probability formula chen et al 2020 11 logit p y i j ln p y j 1 p y j α j β x i where j 1 2 3 4 is accident severity level after the regression coefficient is obtained the cumulative probability of the occurrence of a particular situation can be obtained by the following formula 12 p y i j 1 1 exp α j β x i then the probability of each accident severity level can be expressed as follows 13 p y i j p y i j p y i j 1 furthermore the parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood function the specific formulas are as follows 14 l j 1 j i 1 i f α j 1 β i t x i f α j β i t x i w i j where j is the total number of categories i is the total number of observations w i j is equal to one if x i belongs to category j and zero otherwise it should be noted that the multinomial ordered logit model can be expressed as a joint form of the j 1 binary logit models for j dependent variable levels and the regression coefficient in the equation remains unchanged in addition for the regression coefficient β if the independent variable is a categorical variable in table 2 we have coded each category of each variable as a binary categorical variable then the positive sign indicates that relative to its reference category the effect on the dependent variable is more likely to have a higher severity level while the negative sign is just the opposite if the independent variable is a continuous variable then a positive estimated coefficient means that as the value of the variable increases the likelihood of the dependent variable becoming a higher severity level increases while the negative sign is just the opposite 4 3 marginal effects and goodness of fit measures to evaluate the effects of significant variables in the cluster based multinomial ordered logit model on the accident severity probabilities a marginal effect analysis is conducted washington et al 2010 for continuous variables the marginal effect represents change in the probability of the result with respect to a unit change in that variable while the marginal effect of the binary indicator represents the probability change of the independent variable from the encoded dummy variable 0 to 1 the marginal effects of these two variables can be calculated using equations 15 and 16 respectively 15 δ j x j i r p y j x j i r 16 δ x j i r p j i p j i x j i r 1 p j i x j i r 0 where δ j x j i r is the marginal effect of continuous variables with accident severity level j δ x j i r p j i is the marginal effect of binary variables x j i r is the r th influence variable of the i th accident with the j th severity level the marginal effect of each variable is calculated by averaging the marginal effects over all observations further to assess the fit of the estimated models and generally the goodness of fit of the multinomial ordered logit model is verified by mcfadden s r squared 17 r 2 1 l l β l l 0 where l l β is the log likelihood at convergence and l l 0 is log likelihood at zero 5 estimation results and discussion 5 1 clustering results and analysis maritime accident severity data is divided into different clusters by using a two step clustering algorithm according to all the variables mentioned in table 2 the two step clustering algorithm is implemented in python and applied using a 10 noise allowance finally two clusters are obtained from the analysis the statistical results and centroid of each cluster are shown in table 3 according to the variables with significant influence on clustering listed in table 3 except for the ship type variable there are obvious distinctions indicating that the two clusters are well distinguished in cluster 1 it mainly describes the few ship density small wind and waves good navigation environment and accidents that mainly occur in the daytime while cluster 2 mainly describes the large density ships slightly larger wind and waves than cluster 1 poor navigation environment and accidents occur during the night furthermore from the perspective of two continuous variables in the subsequent multinomial ordered logit analysis these two variables are discretized according to table 2 involving the number of ships and the gross tonnage of ships cluster 1 describes the occurrence of accidents involving few ships and the gross tonnage of ships is not large while cluster 2 is the opposite of cluster 1 the variables in the cluster are not correlated with the significant variables that affect the severity of the accident the effect of specific factors on the severity of the accident needs to be analysed by the following multinomial ordered logit 5 2 multinomial ordered logit results and analysis for each cluster in table 3 a multinomial ordered logit model of accident severity is estimated and an aggregate model is also estimated for the non clustered dataset the forward selection technique is used to select the explanatory independent variables that should be included in the logit regression model this technique starts with calculating the t statistics of each independent variable and then compares the p values of these t statistics with a preset threshold set to 0 10 in this paper if no p value is greater than the threshold the selection will stop otherwise this method will add the variable with the largest absolute t statistic to the model the method will continue calculating the t statistic of the variables still remaining outside the model and repeat the evaluation process using this method variables will be added to the model one by one until no remaining variables produce a significant t statistic weng and yang 2015 the statistically significant variables are presented in tables 4 6 coef is the abbreviation of coefficients and t stat is the abbreviation of t statistics it should be pointed out that the independent variable whose dummy variable is 0 in table 2 is set as the reference item and the dependent variable is the highest level of severity as its reference item very serious a significant finding from tables 4 6 is that the magnitudes signs and significance levels of the estimable independent variable coefficients are greatly different across clusters and this finding confirms the existence of heterogeneity in the influence of factors on the severity of maritime accidents across clusters for instance the sign of the fire explosion indicator is positive in cluster 1 of ship damage consequences which means that the occurrence of a fire explosion accident increases the probability that the ship damage tends to be a higher severity level compared to that of other types however the sign of the variable coefficient in cluster 2 is negative indicating that the occurrence of a fire explosion accident increases the probability of ship damage tends to be a lower severity compared to that of other types a similar situation can also be found in the estimated results of casualty consequences and environmental damage consequences in tables 5 and 6 in addition comparing the estimated results of a cluster based model and an aggregate model we can find that the cluster based model could mine the hidden information for example table 4 shows that according to the aggregate model indicator gross tonnage 500 is not significant but in cluster 1 the indicator sign shows as positive indicating that the occurrence of this indicator will increase the probability of ship damage tends to a higher severity level while in cluster 2 the indicator sign shows as negative indicating that the occurrence of the indicator is will not increase the probability of the ship damage tend to a higher severity level similarly the indicator navigational environment poor in table 5 has a significant effect in the aggregate model although it is not significant in clusters 1 and 2 in both examples the cluster based models reveal a more complete interpretation and effectively reduce heterogeneity another significant finding is that different influencing factors have different effects on the consequences of the three accidents which indicates that if the severity analysis is carried out from the perspective of the overall consequences it is difficult to identify the respective characteristics that affect the severity of each accident consequence for example the time of day night indicator has a significant effect on the severity estimation of the ship damage and casualties while it is not significant in the estimation of the severity of the environmental damage this finding provides an important reference for emergency rescue decision makers to formulate relevant emergency rescue plans 5 2 1 estimation results and analysis of ship damage severity table 4 presents the results of the multinomial ordered model for ship damage severity based on the estimated results in the table and formulas 10 13 the final regression equations can be derived as shown in table 4 1 in appendix c according to the table the fishing ship accidents are closely related to the severity of the ship damage and have significant effects in clusters 1 and 2 which may be related to the severity of fishing ship accidents that are easily affected by influencing factors jin 2014 rezaee et al 2016 bye and aalberg 2018 simultaneously it can be found that the signs of the ship type fishing ship in cluster 1 and cluster 2 are opposite which also shows that cluster analyses can maximize the heterogeneity between clusters in addition the signs of the time of day night and wind and waves 7 8 in cluster 2 are all positive indicating that they have a positive effect on the severity level of ship damage tending to be higher which is in line with the previous studies that the poor natural environment has a greater effect on the severity of ship damage weng and yang 2015 erol et al 2018 wang and yang 2018 ventikos et al 2018 we also found that the sinking accident in cluster 1 has the greatest effect on the severity of ship damage compared to other accident types further by comparing the coefficients of gross tonnage 500 and gross tonnage 10000 in cluster 1 we can find that although both of them have a positive effect on the severity of ship damage tending to a higher level it seems that the indicator gross tonnage 500 has a stronger effect than gross tonnage 10000 that is to say compared with a reference of less than 500 gross tonnages and a reference of less than 10 000 gross tonnages the former shows this effect more strongly in terms of rescue table 4 reveals that the shorter the arrival time of the rescue force is the lower the severity of the final accident consequences which is consistent with our cognition in addition more rescue forces dispatched corresponds to a higher severity of ship damage but the severity of ship damage will not increase equally with the increase in the number of rescue forces for example in cluster 2 the coefficient of no of rescue forces dispatched 10 is greater than the coefficient of no of rescue forces dispatched 20 in other words when the severity of the ship damage reaches the maximum there may be people involved in danger and need to dispatch rescue forces to participate in the rescue currently the severity of the ship damage will not increase but the number of rescue forces dispatched will increase compared to previous studies some common important factors are identified to have an effect on accident severity for example for accident type talley et al 2008 identified a significant positive effect of explosion accidents on cruise ship accident severity compared to other accident types and the estimation results in cluster 1 of this study also show that fire explosion accidents significantly affect ship damage severity compared to other accident types however it should be noted that talley et al 2008 is for the cruise ship accident characteristic conditions while this study is for the cluster 1 characteristic conditions furthermore some other factors have been demonstrated in previous studies to affect the severity of ship damage such as collisions çakır et al 2021 grounding and wind strike wang and yang 2018 this study also shows a significant effect on ship damage under different clustering characteristics 5 2 2 estimation results and analysis of casualty severity table 5 presents the results of the multinomial ordered model for casualty severity based on the estimated results in the table and formulas 10 13 the final regression equations can be derived as shown in table 5 1 in appendix c according to the results wind and waves have a significant effect on the severity of casualty and this finding is in line with that of wang and yang 2018 based on the results of cluster 2 in table 5 the higher the scales of wind and waves are the greater the potential for casualties compared with the 0 6 scales for the types of accidents in accordance with weng et al 2018a and chen et al 2020 collisions are more likely to increase the severity of casualties than other types for ship types fishing ships are more likely to increase the severity of casualties in addition the coefficient sign of the gross tonnage 500 indicator in cluster 1 is negative indicating that it will not make the severity of casualties tend to be higher level which is contrary to its effect on the severity of ship damage as expected from the estimated results of the indicators no of people and no of people involved in cluster 1 we found that more people on board and involved are more likely to lead to very serious casualties in terms of rescue based on the estimated results of the ship density many indicator in cluster 2 we found that when an accident occurs more ships are usually in the vicinity which can reduce the severity of casualties this can be attributed to china s rescue mechanism after an accident occurs at sea china s corresponding rescue agency will first coordinate the surrounding navigation ships to participate in the rescue similar to the results of the severity of ship damage we found from the estimation results of the time of rescue force arrival indicator of cluster 1 and cluster 2 that the shorter the rescue arrival time the more favourable the severity of casualties tends to be lower in addition the no of rescue forces dispatched indicator estimation result in cluster 1 shows that the more rescue forces are dispatched the greater the probability of casualties some of the previously studied variables that had a significant effect on the severity of casualties are also confirmed in this study for example the estimation results in cluster 2 show that the time of the accident at night positively affects the severity of casualties this result coincides with the studies of weng and yang 2015 and weng et al 2018a in cluster 2 of this study it is revealed that poor visibility can increase the severity of casualties compared to good visibility similarly pitman et al 2019 suggested that poor visibility increases the severity of casualties 5 2 3 estimation results and analysis of environmental damage severity table 6 presents the results of the multinomial ordered model for environmental damage severity based on the estimated results in the table and formulas 10 13 the final regression equations can be derived as shown in table 6 1 in appendix c according to the estimation results of the indicators visibility poor and navigational environment poor in cluster 1 the signs of the coefficients are all positive which shows that poor visibility and the navigation environment at the time of the accident may eventually lead to a higher severity level of environmental damage for the types of accidents in cluster 1 fire explosion accidents have the highest probability of serious damage to the environment followed by wind strike collision and sinking accidents in cluster 2 contact accidents have the highest environmental damage followed by fire explosion and sinking accidents for the types of ships we found that both liquid cargo ships and fishing ships have a significant effect on the severity of environmental damage however in cluster 2 the estimated coefficient sign of the ship type liquid cargo ship indicator is positive while the estimated coefficient sign of the ship type fishing ship indicator is negative indicating that the two indicators have the opposite effect on the severity of environmental damage that is compared with other types of ships when a liquid cargo ship has an accident it is more likely to increase the severity level of environmental damage while fishing ships present the opposite trend furthermore when the number of ships involved is greater than 1 then serious environmental damage is likely to occur one possible reason is that the more ships that are involved the higher the severity of an accident in terms of rescue the results in cluster 2 show that a rescue time of less than or equal to 0 5 h will reduce the probability of very serious environmental damage compared to a rescue time of more than 0 5 h in addition the negative estimated coefficient of the time of rescue force arrival 1 indicator in cluster 2 has a smaller value for environmental damage than for ship damage and casualties indicating that the severity of environmental damage is more sensitive to the rescue force arrival time cakir et al 2021 studied the severity of oil spills and revealed that accident type and ship type were the most important factors affecting the severity of oil spills in this study we also found that different accident types and ship types have significant effects on the severity of oil spills in addition the results of shi et al 2019 on the assessment of oil spill severity showed that ships with gross tonnage over 30 000 tonnes increase the oil spill severity compared to those below 30 000 tonnes in contrast the estimation results of cluster 2 in this study reveal that oil spill severity decreases for ships with gross tonnage greater than or equal to 500 compared to ships with gross tonnage less than 500 in the last part of this section we compare the goodness of fit between the aggregate model and the cluster based model the specific results are shown in table 7 according to the likelihood ratio calculation formula l r 2 l l β a g g r e g a t e k 1 2 l l β c l u s t e r k the calculated likelihood ratio results of the three accident consequences are 289 28 219 98 and 313 36 respectively compared with the 99 confidence level and the chi square critical value for 52 degrees of freedom the three results are all greater than the chi square critical value 78 62 indicating that the cluster based model is superior to the aggregate model in addition based on the values of mcfadden s r squared each model has a better fitting effect 5 3 marginal effect analysis in this section a marginal effect analysis is carried out to better explain the severity of estimated accident results as providing the marginal effects of all variables in the models would not be of much benefit we focus only on important and representative variables for the marginal effect analysis as an example the accident type collision variables that have a significant influence in cluster 1 are selected for the marginal effect analysis as shown in fig 4 this figure shows that compared with that of other types of accidents the occurrence of collision accidents dummy indicator changes from zero to one will increase the probability of the very serious consequences of ship damage casualties and environmental damage by 14 25 10 44 and 19 44 respectively showing that this variable is more sensitive to the very serious of environmental damage in addition to the maritime incident level the probability of other severity levels also increased to different degrees in addition a critical aspect that affects the severity of maritime accidents is the rescue conditions as shown in fig 5 the indicator time of rescue force arrival 1 is used as an example to calculate the marginal effect of the severity level of each accident consequence in each cluster when the dummy indicator changes from zero to one the probability of a very serious is significantly reduced indicating that a rescue force arrival time of less than or equal to 1 hour will reduce the likelihood of a very serious accident furthermore the range of marginal effect changes in the likelihood of the accident severity varies across clusters indicating the heterogeneity in the influence of different cluster accidents 6 conclusions in this study from the perspective of maritime emergency rescue we extracted useful information that affects the severity of maritime accidents from investigation reports of accidents that occurred in the sea lanes of china s maritime transportation system issued by the china maritime safety administration and used a cluster based multinomial ordered logit model to analyse the severity of maritime accidents from three aspects ship damage casualties and environmental damage from the analysis useful insights are obtained as follows 1 many factors affect the severity of maritime accidents including natural factors e g wind and waves navigation environment and visibility ship factors e g ship type gross tonnage and number of people on board accident factors e g time of accident type of accident and number of people involved rescue factors e g rescue arrival time number of rescue forces dispatched and ship density 2 the variations in signs and magnitudes of the estimated coefficients across clusters confirm the existence of the heterogeneity in the dataset that if ignored leads to inconsistent estimates 3 there are differences in the factors that affect the severity of the three accident consequences and the development of models separately can effectively dig out their respective characteristics 4 the cluster based multinomial ordered logit model can effectively mine the factors that affect the severity of maritime accidents and reduce the unobserved heterogeneity the above insights provide a reference for emergency rescue decision making and plan formulation this study is limited by the information contained in the accident reports which do not contain certain information such as the ship age and flag which may affect the severity of an accident this aspect is where future research needs to be improved in addition this paper takes a chinese case as an example and whether similar situations in the other waters in the world have yet to be confirmed by further research based on this study further research perspectives can be used to explore the relationship between influencing factors and the severity of maritime accidents based on clustering and other data mining methods credit authorship contribution statement baode li conceptualization

20191,in this study a nonlinear time domain model based on the weak scatterer approximation is developed to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a point absorber wave energy converter wec the simplified wec consists of a floating cylindrical buoy with a hemispherical bottom a single tether and a power take off pto system the efficiency and survivability of the wec are analysed by the proposed numerical model in moderately steep regular waves and focused wave groups respectively the effects of wave steepness on the power absorption of the wec and the pto force are highlighted in the study of regular wave tests by comparison with a linear frequency domain model and the influence of the pto damping coefficient on the performance is discussed then the survivability of the wec in focused wave groups is analysed and validated against the published experimental data it appears that in terms of the motion responses of the buoy and the mooring force the present results have a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data the time frequency characteristics of the motion responses of the buoy are further analysed based on wavelet transforms keywords wave energy converter

principle e g oscillating water columns point absorbers pitching devices and overtopping devices falcão 2010 among the wide variety of wecs point absorbers have attracted a lot of attention typically a point absorber is either a single body that extracts wave energy by reacting against a fixed seabed frame or it is a multi body device that extracts wave energy from the relative motion between two or more bodies the point absorber is characterized by its much smaller horizontal dimensions than the representative wavelength budal and falnes 1975 this concept is convenient for construction and array arrangement and is more suitable to operate in deep water furthermore it is well known that point absorbers are highly adaptable to different wave directions since they are usually designed as axisymmetric buoys a range of numerical techniques have been proposed to model wecs li and yu 2012 penalba et al 2017a davidson and costello 2020 in many cases the linear frequency domain potential flow theory is utilized because of its simplicity and computational efficiency although the linear theory is expected to be sufficient to describe small motions induced by small amplitude waves wecs are often subject to many nonlinearities such as those arising from steep incident waves large amplitude motions complex mooring arrangements power take off pto systems and viscous drag forces in this case the linear frequency domain model may not provide an accurate representation of the actual system dynamics as an alternative time domain models are often used to take into account these nonlinear factors babarit et al 2012 wolgamot and fitzgerald 2015 schubert et al 2020 in particular for point absorbers the nonlinear froude krylov model gilloteaux et al 2007 merigaud et al 2012 giorgi and ringwood 2017 is usually adopted in which nonlinear froude krylov forces and hydrostatic restoring forces are obtained by integrating the pressure of undisturbed incoming waves and the hydrostatic pressure over the instantaneous wetted body surface respectively whereas diffraction and radiation forces remain linear and are separately calculated over the mean wetted body surface as in the linear model the diffraction force is written by a convolution between the diffraction impulse response function and the incident wave elevation at a given reference point according to the cummins equation cummins 1962 the radiation force can be expressed by the infinite frequency added mass term and a convolution of the radiation impulse response function with the velocity of the body the nonlinear froude krylov model is essentially an extension of the linear model referred to as the partially nonlinear model and has been widely utilized by guerinel et al 2013 tarrant and meskell 2016 and penalba et al 2017b however this partially nonlinear model does not take into account the nonlinearities arising from diffraction and radiation forces some fully nonlinear potential flow fnpf models have also been developed guerber et al 2012 abbasnia and guedes soares 2018 kim and koo 2019 as well as computational fluid dynamics cfd models e g windt et al 2018 dafnakis et al 2020 nevertheless both the fnpf and cfd models are still time consuming for practical applications and have some shortcomings in terms of remeshing algorithms and robustness therefore a nonlinear weak scatterer approach may be a good alternative which was firstly proposed by pawlowski 1992 and subsequently developed by kim and kim 2009 for nonlinear ship motions in this approach the scattered wave component is assumed to be small relative to the incident one which can usually be satisfied provided that the horizontal dimensions of the structure are sufficiently small compared to the incident wavelength in this case fully nonlinear free surface conditions may be linearized at the incident wave elevation there are no restrictions on the incident waves except that they are non breaking and thus the case of nonlinear steep incident waves can also be handled the body surface condition is satisfied at the exact body position so that large amplitude body motions can be considered if the weak scatterer approximation is well satisfied this approach is expected to be accurate for small to large amplitude body motions and can be applied to the condition of incident waves with large steepness furthermore this approach is beneficial to remeshing algorithms this is because if the horizontal position of the free surface nodes has been obtained the vertical position of them can be explicitly known at each time step as a result this approach is expected to be more stable than the fully nonlinear method in which the position of the free surface nodes is one of the unknowns to the best of our knowledge although many applications in marine renewable energy industry satisfy the condition of the weak scatterer approximation particularly the point absorber wecs and monopile supported offshore wind turbines only a few numerical models have been established by utilizing this kind of approximation so far a weakly nonlinear model was developed by letournel et al 2014 2018 for submerged bodies and it was applied to two submerged wecs i e the ceto and waveroller devices then chauvigné et al 2015 extended the model to deal with diffraction and radiation problems of a surface piercing vertical cylinder in their numerical model the boundary element method bem was used for solving the boundary value problem and linear triangular elements were adopted afterwards applying the weak scatterer approximation and the higher order boundary element method hobem a novel time domain nonlinear potential flow model was proposed by zhang and teng 2019 2021 to investigate the higher harmonic wave forces and ringing response of a monopile in this paper we further extend the numerical model proposed in zhang and teng 2019 2021 to simulate wave interaction with surface piercing floating bodies both in steep regular waves and focused waves an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach is adopted in the process of time marching to accommodate to large amplitude motions of the floating body two efficient algorithms have been integrated in the numerical model to deal with mesh deformations in this way the computational mesh can be adapted to the varying geometry of the free surface and moving body surface the aim of the present paper is to gain further insight into the numerical modelling of the nonlinear interaction between steep waves and floating bodies while maintaining a rational amount of computation time as a realistic example special focus is given to a simplified point absorber wec presented in ransley et al 2017 the simplified wec consists of a floating cylindrical buoy with a hemispherical bottom a single tether and a pto system the hydrodynamic performance of the wec is extensively investigated in regular waves with a series of wave frequencies and wave steepnesses and the influence of the pto damping coefficient on the performance is discussed in addition the survivability analysis of the wec in extreme wave events is carried out to further verify the capacity and accuracy of the present numerical model in simulating extreme wave interaction with floating bodies the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the mathematical formulation of the problem and section 3 describes the details on the numerical implementation of the present model the performance evaluation of a point absorber wec is introduced in section 4 including the theoretical analysis built upon the linear theory in the frequency domain in section 5 numerical simulations are firstly carried out for the wec in regular waves the hydrodynamic performance of the wec is extensively investigated with various wave frequencies wave steepnesses and pto damping coefficients numerical results of the motion response of the wec the mean absorbed power the absorption efficiency and the pto force are obtained and compared with the results from the linear frequency domain model afterwards the interaction of steep focused wave groups with the floating buoy is simulated and comparisons with the published experimental data and other numerical solutions are provided in terms of the motion responses of the buoy and the mooring force the time frequency characteristics of the motion responses are further analysed based on wavelet transforms finally some conclusions are given in section 6 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 boundary value problem based on weak scatterer approximation as shown in fig 1 a three dimensional fluid domain d is considered which is bounded by a body surface s b a free surface s f a flat bottom surface s d and a far field boundary surface s r we define two right handed cartesian coordinate systems one is the space fixed coordinate system oxyz with the origin o on the still water surface and its z axis pointing vertically upwards and the other is the body fixed coordinate system o x y z with its origin o placed at the body s centre of mass when the body is at its rest position these two coordinate systems are parallel to each other and the centre of mass is initially located at x c x c y c z c in the space fixed coordinate system in this study we introduce a translational vector ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 to denote the displacements of surge sway and heave and a rotational vector θ α β γ ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 to illustrate the angles of roll pitch and yaw respectively thus the relationship between the two sets of coordinate systems can be expressed as 1 x y z x c y c z c ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 t x y z where t is the transformation matrix ma 1998 2 t cos β cos γ cos β sin γ sin β sin α sin β cos γ cos α sin γ sin α sin β sin γ cos α cos γ sin α cos β cos α sin β cos γ sin α sin γ cos α sin β sin γ sin α cos γ cos α cos β within the framework of potential flow theory the fluid motion is assumed to be irrotational and it can be described by a velocity potential φ x y z t which satisfies the laplace s equation within the fluid domain d 3 2 φ 0 the kinematic and dynamic conditions on the instantaneous free surface s f are written as 4 η t φ z φ η 5 φ t g η 1 2 φ φ where η is the free surface elevation and g is the gravitational acceleration the boundary condition on the wetted body surface s b is given as 6 φ n v b n where n is the unit normal vector pointing out of the fluid domain and v b is the velocity vector of a point on the body surface which can be written as 7 v b u ω r b where u ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 is the translational velocity ω ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 is the angular velocity and r b is the position vector of a point on the body surface with respect to the centre of mass on the seabed surface s d the impermeability condition is expressed as 8 φ n 0 in addition an appropriate radiation condition should be defined to avoid the unwanted wave reflection from the far field boundary surface s r which will be discussed later in this study the technique of flow decomposition e g ferrant 1998 ferrant et al 2003 is utilized here the total velocity potential and free surface elevation φ η are split into two parts which are referred to as the incident φ i η i and the scattered φ s η s components the incident components represent the undisturbed incoming wave whereas the scattered components take into account the influence of the structure inside the domain including diffraction and radiation effects the advantages of this separating technique have been specifically introduced in ducrozet et al 2014 and thus are not are not elaborated here furthermore the weak scatterer approximation pawlowski 1992 is adopted assuming that the scattered components are small relative to the incident ones i e 9 φ φ i φ s φ s φ i η η i η s η s η i here φ i and η i are assumed to be known explicitly the expression of them can be obtained by a dedicated wave model for example we can adopt a stream function model rienecker and fenton 1981 for simulating nonlinear regular waves and the high order spectral method ducrozet et al 2016 or the second order stokes type theory dalzell 1999 can be used for irregular waves therefore only the scattered components φ s and η s need to be solved in this study in the light of the weak scatterer approximation the free surface boundary conditions can be linearized at the incident wave elevation z η i x y t under the first order approximation of taylor expansion an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach is introduced to track the free surface nodes and accommodate to large amplitude motions of the floating body thus we define a particular time derivative operator as 10 δ δ t t v mesh the mesh velocity v mesh is defined so that the free surface nodes move with the body motion in the horizontal direction and they move with the variation of the incident free surface vertically and the calculation of v mesh will be outlined in section 3 3 introducing the flow decomposition technique and weak scatterer approximation into the free surface equations i e eqs 4 and 5 leads to the following equations 11 δ η s δ t φ s z φ i v mesh η s φ s η i η s 2 φ i z 2 η i φ i z ν r η s at z η i x y t 12 δ φ s δ t g η s φ i v mesh φ s η s z φ i t 1 2 φ i φ i ν r φ s at z η i x y t in eqs 11 and 12 the terms involving φ i and η i are represented as forcing terms and the value of which can be obtained through the dedicated incident wave model in order to avoid the reflection of scattered waves from the far field boundary and achieve a long time simulation in a reasonably sized domain an artificial damping layer has been included on the free surface near the far field boundary to absorb the scattered wave energy following the approach of bai and eatock taylor 2006 the damping coefficient ν r is chosen as 13 ν r α 0 ω r r 0 β 0 λ 2 r 0 r r d r 0 β 0 λ 0 r r 0 where r denotes the horizontal distance from the origin ω is the characteristic wave frequency λ is the characteristic wavelength and r d is the radius of the free surface computational domain the non dimensional parameters α 0 and β 0 are both determined to be 1 0 in this study within the fluid domain the scattered velocity potential φ s satisfies the laplace s equation and on the wetted body surface it is now subject to the neumann condition as 14 φ s n φ i n v b n on s b in addition the initial conditions on the free surface are imposed as 15 φ s 0 η s 0 at t 0 2 2 higher order boundary element method on the basis of green s second identity the aforementioned nonlinear boundary value problem for the scattered velocity potential φ s can be transformed into an integral equation over the whole boundary s as 16 α x 0 φ s x 0 s φ s x g x x 0 n g x x 0 φ s x n d s where x 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and x x y z are the coordinates of the source and field points respectively α x 0 is the interior solid angle at the point x 0 and g x x 0 is the green s function in this study the rankine source and its images with regard to the seabed z d is adopted as the green s function and thus the integral over the seabed is excluded afterwards the higher order boundary element method hobem is adopted to solve the boundary integral equation and the boundary surface is discretized by quadratic isoparametric elements introducing the shape function h ζ ς in each element we can write the coordinate the velocity potential and its normal derivative within an element in terms of nodal values as 17 x ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς x k φ s ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς φ s k φ s n ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς φ s k n where ζ ς denotes the local intrinsic coordinates x k φ s k φ s k n and h k represent the nodal coordinate the velocity potential its normal derivative and the shape function corresponding to the kth node within the element and k is the total number of nodes in the element i e six and eight for triangular and quadrilateral elements respectively furthermore the computation of solid angle and singular integrals have been described in zhang and teng 2021 and thus is not elaborated here finally the resulting discretized algebraic equations can be written in the following matrix form as 18 a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 x 1 x 2 b 1 b 2 in which x 1 and x 2 contain the unknown nodal velocity potentials on the body surface and nodal normal derivatives of the velocity potential on the free surface respectively a is the influence coefficient matrix and b is a column vector obtained from the known terms the specific expression of which can be referred to zhang and teng 2021 in order to obtain the solution of the system of equations we make use of the efficient generalized minimal residual gmres iterative scheme saad and schultz 1986 with a diagonal preconditioner in the present study from the corresponding boundary conditions and the solution of the boundary value problem we can know the velocity potential φ s and its normal derivative φ s n on the entire boundary of the fluid domain thus the particle velocities φ s both on the body surface and free surface can be easily determined by 19 φ s x φ s y φ s z x ζ y ζ z ζ x ς y ς z ς n x n y n z 1 φ s ζ φ s ς φ s n where n x n y n z are the components of the unit normal vector and they can be expressed as 20 n x j 1 j n y j 2 j n z j 3 j where 21 j 1 y ζ z ς z ζ y ς 22 j 2 z ζ x ς x ζ z ς 23 j 3 x ζ y ς y ζ x ς 24 j j 1 2 j 2 2 j 3 2 the derivatives of x x y z and φ s with respect to ζ and ς in the above formulas can be simply obtained from differentiation of the shape function based on eq 17 2 3 motion response of the floating buoy for the floating buoy the equation of motion is written as 25 m ξ b ξ f h m h f pto m pto f g 0 where m is the 6 6 generalized mass matrix and b is a linearized viscous damping matrix which is introduced to incorporate the viscous effect that is ignored in the potential flow theory as outlined in section 2 3 3 ξ and ξ denote the velocity and acceleration vectors of the buoy respectively which are the 6 1 column vectors including all the translational and rotational motions f h and m h denote the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the floating buoy it should be emphasized that the hydrostatic forces and moments are also included in the expression of f h and m h described in section 2 3 1 f pto and m pto are the pto forces and moments exerted on the buoy which are described in detail in section 2 3 2 in addition f g m g k is the gravity of the buoy where m is the mass of the buoy and k is the unit vector along the z axis 2 3 1 hydrodynamic forces the pressure on the body can be obtained from the bernoulli s equation 26 p ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z afterwards the hydrodynamic forces f h f h 1 f h 2 f h 3 and moments m h f h 4 f h 5 f h 6 on the body are calculated by integrating the pressure over its instantaneous wetted surface in addition the integrals over the exact wetted body surface s b are divided into two parts one is over the wetted body surface s b w bounded by the incident wave profile the other is converted to waterline integrals by taylor expansion at the incident wave elevation i e 27 f h i s b p n i d s ρ s b w φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z n i d s ρ γ η s φ t 1 2 φ 2 1 2 g 2 η i η s η s 2 n i d l i 1 6 where ρ is the fluid density n 1 n 2 n 3 n and n 4 n 5 n 6 r b n it is worth noting that the particle velocities φ on the body surface in eq 27 can be obtained numerically however accurate calculation of φ t is rather difficult particularly in the case of freely moving bodies in this study we apply a novel backward difference approach with the consideration of grid motion by using the time derivative operator δ δ t t v mesh φ t can be written as 28 φ t φ i t φ s t φ i t δ φ s δ t v mesh φ s where v mesh is the mesh velocity on the body surface and δ φ s δ t is computed by a conventional difference scheme using the velocity potential φ s at the present and previous time steps 2 3 2 pto forces in this study the floating buoy is attached to the sea floor through a single tether with one end attached to the bottom of the buoy and the other end anchored at the sea floor as shown in fig 2 under wave action the buoy can move in six degrees of freedom 6 dof and the motion of the buoy is restrained by the tether the wave energy can be extracted from the oscillating motion of the buoy by using a pto system as shown in fig 2 the pto system is installed along the tether and modelled approximately as a linear spring damper system as a result the pto forces f pto exerted on the buoy act along the tether and can be written as 29 f pto f pto l a b l a b where f pto denotes the magnitude of the pto force tether tension l a b denotes the instantaneous tether vector from the anchor point a to the attachment point b and represents the magnitude of the vector in general f pto consists of a pre tension force that counteracts the buoy s net buoyancy force i e ρ g m g in which is the displaced water volume of the buoy at the rest position a spring force proportional to the tether extension δ l and a damping force proportional to the rate of change of tether extension δ l i e 30 f pto t 0 k m δ l b pto δ l where t 0 is the static pre tension force k m is the mechanical stiffness coefficient and b p t o is the pto damping coefficient including all the translational motions ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 and rotational motions ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 of the buoy the full expression for tether extension can be written as 31 δ l ξ 1 h sin ξ 5 2 ξ 2 h cos ξ 5 sin ξ 4 2 ξ 3 l 0 h 1 cos ξ 5 cos ξ 4 2 l 0 where h is the distance between the buoy s centre of mass and the attachment point and l 0 is the initial static tether length when the buoy is at the rest position considering that the buoy and the incoming wave are symmetric about the x z plane only 3 dof motions i e surge heave and pitch are considered here thus eq 31 is simplified as 32 δ l ξ 1 h sin ξ 5 2 ξ 3 l 0 h 1 cos ξ 5 2 l 0 the rate of change of the tether extension can then be derived as 33 δ l ξ 1 h sin ξ 5 ξ 1 h ξ 5 cos ξ 5 ξ 3 l 0 h 1 cos ξ 5 ξ 3 h ξ 5 sin ξ 5 ξ 1 h sin ξ 5 2 ξ 3 l 0 h 1 cos ξ 5 2 the moments arising from the pto forces are given as 34 m pto r m f pto where r m denotes the position vector from the buoy s centre of mass to the attachment point 2 3 3 viscous damping matrix we know that the overall fluid damping of a floating buoy mainly consists of two parts one is the inviscid radiation damping and the other is the viscous damping arising from the viscous friction and vortex shedding bhinder et al 2011 jin and patton 2017 the level of the viscous damping is quite difficult to be determined accurately which is beyond the scope of the potential flow theory as an alternative a linearized viscous damping matrix b is introduced to incorporate the viscous effect and the value of which can be obtained from a free decay test in still water in this study the total fluid damping matrix is expressed in terms of rayleigh damping and the diagonal terms of the viscous damping matrix are determined by subtracting the radiation damping from the total fluid damping i e b i i α i m i i a i i b i i where α i 2 ζ i ω n i is the total damping factor ω n i and ζ i are the natural frequency and damping ratio of the body in the ith mode of motion which can be estimated from a free decay test in still water in the absence of pto damping a i i and b i i are the corresponding added mass and radiation damping coefficients which can be simply obtained from a frequency domain potential flow solver teng and eatock taylor 1995 the off diagonal terms in the viscous damping matrix are assumed to be zero 3 numerical implementation 3 1 time stepping scheme after solving the boundary value problem and obtaining the particle velocities on the free surface we can update the free surface geometry and velocity potential for the computation at the next time step by integrating the nonlinear free surface conditions in time in this study the fourth order runge kutta rk4 time integration scheme is adopted together with the ale approach which provides good stability and accuracy in order to avoid an abrupt initial condition a cosine ramp function is applied to the incident wave field when the numerical simulation is started and the expression of which is the same as bai and eatock taylor 2006 it makes the simulation more stable and reach the steady state earlier 3 2 waterline node tracking during the simulation the position of the waterline varies with time due to the propagation of the incident wave and the body motion in order to ensure that the waterline node remains on the intersection between the incident free surface and the exact body surface its position is required to be tracked and updated in real time in this study the shape of the buoy is regular which consists of a cylinder on the top and a hemisphere at the bottom as shown in fig 1 applying the expression of the cylindrical and spherical surface the horizontal coordinates of the nth waterline node in the body fixed coordinate system can be written as 35 x w n r cos θ n y w n r sin θ n if z w n z s 36 x w n r 2 z w n z s 2 cos θ n y w n r 2 z w n z s 2 sin θ n if z w n z s where r is the radius of the buoy θ n is the circumferential angle which is uniformly distributed in the body fixed coordinate system z w n and z s are the body fixed vertical coordinates of the nth waterline node and the centre of sphere respectively substituting eq 35 or eq 36 into eq 1 and combining it with z w n η i x w n y w n t this leads to a nonlinear equation about z w n which can be solved by the iteration method with aitken acceleration i e the steffensen iteration method once the body fixed coordinates x w n y w n z w n are known the space fixed coordinates of the nth waterline node can be obtained by eq 1 so that the tracking and updating of waterline nodes are achieved with time 3 3 mesh deformation and interpolation the geometry of the fluid domain varies with the free surface elevation and the exact position of the body therefore it is necessary to adapt the computational mesh at each time step according to these deformations in order to avoid remeshing the entire computational domain at each time step we have integrated two efficient mesh deformation algorithms to make it possible to maintain high mesh quality and the same mesh topology during the deformation as shown in fig 3 the body surface nodes are assumed to be uniformly distributed along the circumferential direction in the body fixed coordinate system and the mesh connectivity remains unchanged during the deformation of body mesh in the body fixed coordinate system once the vertical coordinate of the internal node is updated with the variation of the intersection between the free surface and the body surface to adapt to the deformation the corresponding horizontal coordinates of the node can be similarly determined by eq 35 or eq 36 in this way only the vertical displacement of the node needs to be specified which is simply given as 37 δ z m n δ z w n f s d where δ z w n is the vertical displacement of the nth waterline node which can be obtained by the difference between the new and initial vertical coordinates and f s d denotes the displacement distribution along the vertical direction which is assumed to be sinusoidal and written as 38 f s d m 0 5 1 cos ϕ m 2 0 25 1 cos ϕ m 39 ϕ m m 1 π 2 m in which m 1 2 m 1 and m is the number of elements in the vertical direction it indicates that f s d 0 at the bottom of the buoy i e m 1 and f s d 1 at the waterline i e m 2 m 1 which satisfy the displacement condition at the boundary it is proved that the sinusoidal type displacement distribution is capable of achieving a good quality of the deformed body mesh then the new vertical coordinate of the node can be updated by 40 z m n new z m n initial δ z m n where z m n initial denotes the vertical coordinate of the node at the initial time once the body fixed coordinates of the body surface nodes are known the space fixed coordinates of which can be obtained by eq 1 and the updating of the mesh on the body surface are achieved for the deformation of the mesh on the free surface a spring analogy method blom 2000 is commonly used to accommodate to the body motion in the computational domain which can be found in ma and yan 2009 and zhou et al 2015 nevertheless it needs to solve a large system of linear equations whose size is near the total number of grid nodes on the free surface and thus will be very time consuming if the number of the free surface nodes is quite large therefore a mesh deformation algorithm based on radial basis function rbf interpolation proposed by de boer et al 2007 is applied here as an alternative the prominent advantages and numerical implementation of the rbf interpolation method have been specifically introduced in zhang and teng 2021 and thus are not elaborated here for simplicity we firstly project the free surface nodes onto the horizontal plane and then move them around in this plane by using the rbf interpolation method provided that the displacement of the boundary nodes i e waterline nodes and outer boundary nodes has been known this leads to the new horizontal coordinates for the free surface nodes afterwards the horizontal velocities of the nodes can be easily obtained from the displacement moreover an additional condition should be imposed on the node velocity to ensure that the nodes on the free surface still stay on this surface i e 41 v mesh n φ i n according to the new horizontal coordinates of the free surface nodes the scattered wave elevation η s and velocity potential φ s at the new node can be computed by an interpolation scheme as described in zhang and teng 2021 3 4 schematic summary of numerical algorithm as shown in fig 4 a flow chart is presented here to briefly summarize the above contents and illustrate the numerical computation process for the sake of better descriptions some explanations about the major components of the numerical algorithm are given below 1 calculate the expressions of the incident wave based on a dedicated wave model 2 track waterline nodes in real time 3 update computational grids on the body and free surface by two efficient mesh deformation algorithms and then update η s and φ s on the free surface by an interpolation scheme 4 solve the boundary integral equation bie using hobem 5 calculate the hydrodynamic forces and obtain the motion responses of the buoy 6 update the time step and repeat steps 1 5 4 performance evaluation of the wave energy converter as shown in fig 2 the floating buoy is designed to extract wave energy from its oscillating motion induced by ocean waves using a pto system installed along the tether in marine renewable energy terminology the device can be regarded as a point absorber wec since the horizontal extension of the buoy is usually small relative to the representative wavelength owing to the axisymmetry of the buoy power can be effectively extracted from ocean waves regardless of the direction of incidence referring to ding et al 2018 and orszaghova et al 2019 the wave power is primarily extracted from the buoy s heave motion since the other modes are only weakly coupled to the pto system due to the kinematic constraint of the single tether pto arrangement in their linear frequency domain analysis only the heave mode is considered to extract wave power at the linearized approximation however the wave power extracted from the buoy s 3 dof oscillating motions can be directly evaluated by the present nonlinear time domain model and thus the influence of nonlinear surge pitch coupling on the actual performance of the multi mode wec can be incorporated by comparing the results of these two numerical models the limitations of the linear model can be clearly seen the time averaged absorbed power of the wec over one wave period t is defined as 42 p abs 1 t t t t b p t o δ l 2 d t for a regular wave the mean wave energy flux per unit width of wave crest is given as 43 p w 1 2 ρ g a 2 c g in which a is the incident wave amplitude and c g is the group velocity which represents the energy transportation speed of the wave and can be expressed as 44 c g ω 2 k 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d where ω is the angular frequency k is the wavenumber and d is the water depth the capture width ratio i e absorption efficiency of the wec in regular waves can subsequently be defined as 45 c w p abs p w 2 r where 2r is the characteristic scale of the wec in this study r is the radius of the buoy 4 1 linear frequency domain analysis assuming small translational and rotational motions the equation of motion can be linearized at the rest position of the buoy within the framework of linear hydrodynamics in the frequency domain the diffraction and radiation problems are decoupled in this way the equation of motion for the wec can be written as 46 m a ω ξ b pto b b ω ξ k pto c ξ f exc where m is the mass matrix of the buoy a ω and b ω denote the frequency dependent added mass and radiation damping matrix respectively b is the linearized viscous damping matrix as outlined in section 2 3 3 c is the stiffness matrix arising from the hydrostatic restoring force k pto and b p t o are the linearized pto stiffness and damping matrix respectively which can be written as 47 k pto t 0 l 0 0 0 0 t 0 h l 0 0 0 t 0 l 0 0 t 0 h l 0 0 0 0 0 k m 0 0 0 0 t 0 h l 0 0 t 0 h 1 h l 0 0 0 t 0 h l 0 0 0 0 t 0 h 1 h l 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 48 b p t o 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 b p t o 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 it is noted that the pto stiffness matrix k pto depends on the initial tether length l 0 the pre tension force of the tether t 0 the stiffness coefficient k m and the distance between the buoy s centre of mass and the tether attachment point on the buoy i e h whereas the pto damping matrix b p t o is only dependent on the pto damping coefficient b p t o f e x c is the vector of linear wave excitation forces and ξ ξ and ξ denote the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors of the buoy respectively eq 48 implies that under the kinematic constraint of the single tether pto arrangement and the linearized approximation only the heave mode is applied to produce power thus in accordance with eq 46 the equation of heave motion of the wec can be written as 49 m 33 a 33 ξ 3 b p t o λ 33 ξ 3 k 33 c 33 ξ 3 f e 3 where m 33 is the mass of the buoy a 33 is the added mass in heave mode λ 33 b 33 b 33 denotes the total hydrodynamic damping coefficient in heave mode with the viscous effect considered in which b 33 is the inviscid radiation damping coefficient and b 33 is the linearized viscous damping coefficient k 33 and c 33 are coefficients of the pto stiffness matrix and the hydrostatic restoring force in heave mode respectively here k 33 k m based on eq 47 and c 33 ρ g a w p where a w p is the water plane area of the buoy in a monochromatic wave assuming the variables are time harmonic with an angular frequency ω the vertical wave excitation force f e 3 and the heave response ξ 3 can be written as 50 f e 3 t re f e 3 e i ω t 51 ξ 3 t re χ 3 e i ω t where f e 3 and χ 3 are the complex amplitudes of the wave excitation force and motion response in heave mode respectively and re represents the real part of a complex variable to be considered then from eq 49 the amplitude of heave motion of the wec can be expressed as 52 χ 3 f e 3 m 33 a 33 ω 2 k 33 c 33 2 ω 2 b p t o λ 33 2 in which represents the modulus of the complex variable the mean absorbed power of the wec defined in eq 42 can now be written as 53 p abs 1 2 b p t o ω 2 χ 3 2 excluding the excitation and damping terms in eq 49 the undamped natural frequency of the wec in heave mode can be obtained by 54 ω n 3 k 33 c 33 m 33 a 33 ω n 3 as a reactive control strategy falnes 2002 the natural frequency of the wec can be tuned within limits to the characteristic frequency of incoming waves by adjusting the mechanical stiffness coefficient to achieve resonance which is usually utilized to maximize the wave power absorption using p abs b p t o 0 the optimal pto damping coefficient is given as 55 b p t o opt m 33 a 33 ω 2 k 33 c 33 2 ω 2 λ 33 2 from eq 55 we can know that when ω ω n 3 b p t o opt λ 33 this leads to the maximum time averaged absorbed power at resonance 56 p abs max f e 3 2 8 λ 33 using the haskind relation between the wave excitation force and the radiation damping in heave mode falnes 2002 57 f e 3 2 4 k ρ g a 2 c g b 33 and substituting eqs 56 and 43 into eq 45 the maximum capture width ratio can be given as 58 c w max 1 k res 1 f vis 2 r where k res is the wavenumber at resonance and f vis b 33 b 33 is the ratio of viscous damping to radiation damping note that if the viscous effect is assumed to be neglected i e f vis 0 then c w max 1 k res 2 r this is corresponding to the well known theoretical result of inviscid fluid obtained independently by budal and falnes 1975 newman 1976 and evans 1976 on the maximum power i e p abs max p w k that can be absorbed from the waves by an axisymmetric heaving buoy under the assumption of unconstrained motion 5 numerical results and discussion 5 1 experimental and numerical setup the wave energy device considered in this study is the same as that adopted in the experiment of ransley et al 2017 which comprises a cylindrical buoy with a hemispherical bottom and a linearly elastic mooring see fig 5 the experiment was carried out in the coast laboratory ocean basin at the university of plymouth uk the basin is 35 m long and 15 5 m wide with 24 flap type wave paddles installed at one end and a parabolic beach at the other end the water depth was set at 2 8 m in the region where the buoy was placed as shown in fig 5 the buoy consists of a cylinder on the top and a hemisphere at the bottom which has a diameter d 2r 0 5 m the total mass of the buoy is 43 2 kg and the centre of mass is located at 0 181 m above the bottom of the buoy i e h 0 181 m the moment of inertia of the buoy is 1 61 1 61 0 5 kg m2 in addition a single point mooring was used in the experiment to restrain the motion of the buoy with one end attached to the bottom of the buoy and the other end fixed at the basin floor the mooring line is simplified as a linear spring which has a stiffness coefficient of 67 n m and a rest length of 2 18 m according to the initial static equilibrium condition the pre tension force and initial length of the mooring line can be determined i e t 0 20 84 n l 0 2 491 m the viscous effect which is neglected in the potential flow theory is also incorporated in the simulation as mentioned in section 2 3 3 the total damping factor can be estimated from the experimental free decay signals see ransley et al 2017 of the buoy in still water by using the logarithmic decrement method and then the viscous damping is determined by subtracting the corresponding radiation damping from the total fluid damping following this method the viscous damping coefficient of the buoy in heave mode is determined to be 5 1 kg s and the ratio of viscous damping to radiation damping is about 0 14 at the resonance frequency i e f vis 0 14 this reveals that the hemispherical bottom shape leads to relatively small viscous dissipation since the bottom surface is smooth and lack of sharp edges or corners that are responsible for the flow separation and vortex shedding compared to a flat bottom with sharp edges the hemispherical bottom will amplify the motion response of the buoy and thus will improve the power absorption efficiency which has been demonstrated in jin and patton 2017 5 2 regular wave tests in this section the hydrodynamic performance of the wec in regular waves is extensively investigated with various wave frequencies and wave steepnesses and the influence of the pto damping coefficient on the performance is discussed in this study a linear frequency domain model teng and eatock taylor 1995 is firstly implemented fig 6 gives the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave excitation force in heave mode it is noted that the reactive control strategy falnes 2002 is not implemented here for simplicity and the stiffness coefficient of k m 67 n m is fixed in the numerical calculations with different wave frequencies thus the natural frequency ω n 3 of the wec is estimated to be 5 86 rad s based on eq 54 as well as the value of a 33 shown in fig 6 a which is corresponding to the non dimensional wavenumber kr 0 875 according to the linear frequency domain analysis described in section 4 1 the optimal pto damping coefficient b p t o opt is equal to the total fluid damping at resonance which is about 41 52 kg s fig 7 shows the heave rao mean absorbed power and capture width ratio of the wec against kr with different pto damping coefficients in which ν b p t o b p t o opt is the normalized pto damping coefficient it appears that the heave rao mean absorbed power and capture width ratio reach the peak value almost simultaneously at the resonance frequency and the resonance frequency decreases as the pto damping coefficient increases as expected the heave rao decreases with increasing the pto damping coefficient and the peak values of the mean absorbed power and capture width ratio are maximized for ν 1 0 which is in line with the theoretical analysis described in section 4 1 nevertheless it can be seen from fig 7 c that the effective frequency bandwidth of the wec i e the frequency range within which the capture width ratio is larger than a reference value e g 20 becomes wider with the increase of the pto damping coefficient which is beneficial to improving the overall performance of the wec in realistic sea states with broad banded spectra other approaches such as the control strategy could also widen the effective frequency bandwidth and improve the wave power extraction which is beyond the scope of this paper afterwards the nonlinear time domain model is adopted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the wec and the numerical results are compared to the linear ones a relatively comprehensive comparison is provided with regard to a series of kr from 0 25 to 1 5 three different wave steepnesses i e ε ka 0 10 0 15 and 0 20 are considered for each wave frequency to investigate the effect of nonlinearity as outlined in section 2 1 the stream function model rienecker and fenton 1981 is utilized here to simulate nonlinear incident regular waves for the wave buoy interaction the convergence study of computational mesh and time step is firstly implemented in each simulation several different time steps have been tested and δ t t 100 where t is the characteristic wave period is found to be accurate enough for the following cases furthermore appropriate computational grids are chosen to achieve the best compromise between accuracy and computational effort fig 8 shows an example of the initial computational mesh using 1116 elements and 3473 nodes on the buoy and free surface in general the radius of the free surface computational domain is chosen as r d 2 λ where λ is the wavelength moreover an annular damping layer with a distance of near one wavelength is imposed on the outer region of the free surface to prevent wave reflections the radial length of the free surface element gradually increases towards the outer boundary since the scattered waves decay with the increase of the distance from the buoy this leads to a significant reduction of the computational effort in this study the simulation of each case took approximately 0 7 h of cpu time per wave period running on a desktop of six intel core i7 8700k cpu 3 70 ghz processors in the nonlinear time domain results transient effects for each simulation have been discarded to ensure that the steady state operation of the wec is considered fig 9 shows the performance of the wec in the frequency domain with b p t o 41 52 kg s i e ν 1 0 including the normalized mean absorbed power and the capture width ratio it appears that the present numerical results are quite consistent with the linear results in the condition of small wave steepness nevertheless the discrepancy gradually increases with increasing wave steepness especially in the range of kr 0 875 1 25 and at around kr 0 625 it may be due to that the influence of nonlinear surge pitch coupling on the performance of the multi mode wec is incorporated in the present nonlinear time domain model as shown in eq 33 whereas only the heave mode is considered to extract wave power at the linearized approximation in the linear frequency domain model note that kr 0 625 is near the resonance frequency in pitch mode and thus the pitch response of the wec becomes to be large at kr 0 625 it can be known that the large pitch response has a significant effect on the pto velocity and mean absorbed power based on eqs 33 and 42 fig 10 shows the time series of the normalized instantaneous power absorbed by the pto damper at kr 0 625 and 0 875 with different wave steepness it can be seen that the steady state operation of the wec has been achieved after 30 periods the phase shift of the results with different wave steepness arises from the difference in the horizontal equilibrium position of the wec actually the equilibrium position of the wec is influenced by the slow drift in surge mode which is closely related with the wave steepness moreover the instantaneous power absorbed by the pto damper at kr 0 625 seems to have more higher order harmonics compared with that at kr 0 875 this is due to that the near resonant pitch response at kr 0 625 plays an important role in the overall performance of the wec whereas at kr 0 875 the heave mode dominates the absorption of wave power however for the normalized maximum dynamic pto force tether tension shown in fig 11 the significant discrepancy arises between the present results and the linear results with the increase of wave steepness for large kr conditions the discrepancy is primarily due to the slow drift of the wec in surge mode since the natural frequency of the wec in surge mode is quite small note that the present nonlinear time domain model is able to capture the slow drift phenomenon whereas the linear frequency domain model cannot capture it it is easy to know from eq 32 that the peak value of the tether extension increases with the slow drift of the wec and the slow drift significantly increases with the increase of the wave steepness ka and the non dimensional wavenumber kr therefore the normalized dynamic pto force mainly the component of spring force proportional to the tether extension significantly increases with the increase of wave steepness in addition the near resonant pitch response around kr 0 625 leads to a large contribution to the tether extension which also plays an important role in the discrepancy between the present results and the linear results for instance fig 12 shows the time series of the normalized dynamic pto force at kr 0 625 and 0 875 with different wave steepness it can be seen that the mean value of the dynamic pto force is gradually away from zero and the peak value increases significantly with the increase of wave steepness accurate estimation of the slow drift motion is an important criterion for designing a robust pto system for the single tethered wec furthermore the influence of the pto damping coefficient on the performance of the wec is investigated fig 13 shows the heave rao and capture width ratio of the wec at resonance i e kr 0 875 with various pto damping coefficients it is expected that the heave rao decreases with the increase of pto damping coefficients and has little relation with wave steepness for the capture width ratio the present numerical results are quite consistent with the linear results in the condition of small wave steepness it is seen from fig 13 b that the capture width ratio increases firstly and then decreases with the increase of pto damping coefficients and it achieves its maximum at b p t o b p t o opt 1 0 which is in line with the theoretical analysis described in section 4 1 nevertheless the optimal pto damping coefficient predicted by the linear theory does not result in an optimal performance for steeper waves it appears that as the wave steepness increases the maximum absorption efficiency of the wec occurs in a larger pto damping coefficient relative to that predicted by the linear theory 5 3 focused wave tests in addition to the performance of the wec during the steady state operation the survivability of the wec in extreme wave events is also a critical issue in the practical design in order to assess the most extreme device reactions during storms the interaction of steep focused wave groups with the above wave energy device was experimentally investigated in ransley et al 2017 note that the pto system was not incorporated into the experimental setup since it is generally locked under the circumstances of extreme waves to avoid damage hann et al 2015 in this section the numerical model is further validated against the laboratory measurements in order to be consistent with the experimental condition the stiffness coefficient and the pto damping coefficient are set to 67 n m and 0 kg s respectively the motion responses of the buoy and the mooring force are well reproduced and further analysed in the numerical simulation we adopt the second order stokes type theory dalzell 1999 ning et al 2009 to obtain the surface elevation and velocity potential for the incident focused wave groups i e η i and φ i to get realistic modelling of extreme wave events in the manner of a convenient design wave as ransley et al 2017 employed in the experiment the amplitudes of the individual wave components were determined by the newwave theory tromans et al 1991 as 59 a i a i s f i δ f i i 1 n s f i δ f i in which a i is the input crest amplitude i e the linear sum of the component wave amplitudes n is the total number of wave components s f i is the power spectrum and δ f i is the frequency interval in this test case the pierson moskowitz pm spectrum with the peak frequency f p 0 356 hz is adopted as shown in fig 14 a total of 120 wave components are utilized with the frequency range from 0 2 hz to 1 6 hz which covers the frequency components carrying most of the wave energy in the spectrum note that for the sake of the comparison shown below the origin of x axis in the numerical simulation is placed at 8 m forward from the wave paddle used in the experiment ransley et al 2017 employed the wave gauge measurement in the experiment at this location to serve as the input data for the inlet boundary of their openfoam model however the relevant experimental data were not specifically reported in ransley et al 2017 as a result a trial and error process is utilized here to adjust the input focal position and crest amplitude for generating the desired focused wave the input focal position and crest amplitude are determined to be x 5 2 m and a i 0 25 m respectively firstly the incident focused wave is validated in terms of the surface elevations at several spatial positions and fig 15 shows the comparison between the numerical and experimental results overall the present numerical results agree quite well with the experimental data it is seen that the main wave crest and troughs are well captured this indicates that the present model can well reproduce the incident focused wave measured in the physical experiment providing the basis for a meaningful comparison of the wave buoy interaction shown below the focused wave described above is then utilized to interact with the floating buoy the buoy is placed at x 5 49 m fig 16 shows the present numerical results for the motion responses i e surge displacement heave displacement and pitch angle of the floating buoy which are compared with the linear results the second order results the results of pic model chen et al 2019 and the experimental data overall there is a satisfying agreement between the present results and the experimental data the low frequency slow drift in the surge displacement and high frequency response in the pitch angle are well captured by the present model however the linear model is unable to predict the slow drift phenomenon in the surge displacement and thus a large discrepancy arises between the linear and experimental results the second order model improves the result to a great extent due to the consideration of second order difference frequency wave loads but still underestimates the peak value of the surge displacement the pic results and the present results are both in good agreement with the experimental data for the pitch response of the floating buoy it behaves like a free oscillation after the main wave crest has passed compared with the experimental results during this period it can be seen that the linear and second order results appear to have a significant phase shift and the pic results show a notable overestimation nevertheless the present results achieve a better agreement with the experimental data the heave displacement is primarily a linear response to the wave frequency component and the discrepancy among various results seems to be less notable further the time frequency characteristics of the motion responses of the buoy are analysed based on wavelet transforms in this paper the most widely used complex morlet wavelet is chosen applying the approach of massel 2001 we can analytically derive the relationship between the wavelet scale and the fourier frequency for the morlet wavelet the details can be referred to zhang and teng 2021 fig 17 shows the wavelet spectra of the motion responses of the buoy obtained by the present model it can be seen that the frequency components of the surge response include the significant low frequency component and the wave frequency component within the input range the heave response is primarily a linear response to the wave frequency component and the nonlinear component appears to be not notable the pitch response are mainly composed of the wave frequency and high frequency components note that after the maximum crest of focused wave groups passing through the buoy the wave motion and the induced wave excitation force become less significant whereas the significant pitch response arises at f 0 72 hz which is almost double the peak wave frequency i e f 2f p and near the natural frequency of the buoy in pitch mode this implies that the pitch response of the buoy behaves similarly to a free decay during this period and the free oscillation lasts for a long time since the damping in pitch mode is slight similarly the comparison between the linear second order pic and present numerical results for the wave loads i e surge force heave force and pitch moment on the buoy is shown in fig 18 note that the wave loads were not measured in the experiment and thus no experimental data were available for comparison it is noticed that the present results have similar trends with the second order results except that there is a clear phase shift between the results for the pitch moment this is closely related to the different phase between the results for the pitch response since the pitch moment is dominated by the radiation force after the main wave crest passing through the buoy the pic results show a notable overestimation for the heave force and pitch moment compared to other numerical results furthermore fig 19 presents the comparison for the mooring force once again the present results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data as a consequence of the good reproduction of the motion responses of the buoy it can also be seen that the mooring force shows similar trends with the heave response which implies the tether extension is dominated by the heave response in this test case finally we made a rough comparison in terms of the cpu cost on simulating the above case the present model took about 20 0 h for the 30 s simulation running on a desktop of 6 intel core i7 8700k cpu 3 70 ghz processors however it took almost 500 h of cpu time for the 28 s simulation of the same case running on 6 intel xeon cpu e5630 2 53 ghz processors for the openfoam model of ransley et al 2017 while the pic model chen et al 2019 took approximately 32 9 h for the 30 s simulation of the same case using 160 cores at the university of bath high performance computing system thus the present model leads to a significant reduction of the computational effort compared with the cfd models 6 conclusions in the light of the weak scatterer approximation a nonlinear time domain model is proposed in this paper for dealing with nonlinear wave interaction with floating bodies the corresponding boundary value problem is solved by the higher order boundary element method hobem at each time step in the process of time marching an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach and the fourth order runge kutta scheme are adopted on the free surface two efficient mesh deformation algorithms have been integrated in the numerical model and thus the computational mesh can be adapted to the varying geometry of the free surface and moving body surface in this way the nonlinearities arising from steep incident waves and large amplitude body motions can be taken into account and well handled by the proposed model this paper focuses on the nonlinear time domain simulations of a simplified point absorber wec which consists of a floating cylindrical buoy with a hemispherical bottom a single tether and a pto system the efficiency and survivability of the wec are analysed by the proposed numerical model in moderately steep regular waves and focused wave groups respectively the effects of wave steepness on the power absorption of the wec and the pto force are highlighted in the study of regular wave tests by comparison with a linear frequency domain model and the influence of the pto damping coefficient on the performance is discussed it appears that as the wave steepness increases accurate estimation of the slow drift motion is an important criterion for designing a robust pto system for the single tethered wec and the optimal pto damping coefficient that leads to the maximum absorption efficiency of the wec becomes larger relative to that predicted by the linear theory it is noted that the influence of nonlinear surge pitch coupling on the performance of the multi mode wec is incorporated in the present model whereas only the heave mode is considered to extract wave power at the linearized approximation in the linear frequency domain model afterwards the survivability of the wec in focused wave groups is analysed and validated against the published experimental data and other numerical results in terms of the motion responses of the buoy and the mooring force the comparisons demonstrate a satisfactory accuracy of the present model nevertheless the present model achieves the higher computational efficiency compared with the cfd models based on a rough comparison of the cpu cost on simulating the same case furthermore the time frequency characteristics of the motion responses of the buoy are further analysed based on wavelet transforms it is known that control strategies are usually utilized to widen the effective frequency bandwidth and improve the energy extraction efficiency for a practical wec particularly in irregular sea states nevertheless no pto control scheme is implemented in this study for simplicity the introduction of control algorithms into the performance evaluation of wecs can be of great importance and this

20191,in this study a nonlinear time domain model based on the weak scatterer approximation is developed to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of a point absorber wave energy converter wec the

weak scatterer approximation motion responses pto damping hydrodynamic performance 1 introduction ocean waves are a huge and largely untapped resource of renewable energy due to the high power density and longtime availability wave energy has been an active area of research during the last decades a wide variety of concepts for wave energy converters wecs have been invented to extract energy from ocean waves falnes 2007 drew et al 2009 falcão 2010 in general although there are large variations in designs and concepts wecs can be classified into several main types according to their working principle e g oscillating water columns point absorbers pitching devices and overtopping devices falcão 2010 among the wide variety of wecs point absorbers have attracted a lot of attention typically a point absorber is either a single body that extracts wave energy by reacting against a fixed seabed frame or it is a multi body device that extracts wave energy from the relative motion between two or more bodies the point absorber is characterized by its much smaller horizontal dimensions than the representative wavelength budal and falnes 1975 this concept is convenient for construction and array arrangement and is more suitable to operate in deep water furthermore it is well known that point absorbers are highly adaptable to different wave directions since they are usually designed as axisymmetric buoys a range of numerical techniques have been proposed to model wecs li and yu 2012 penalba et al 2017a davidson and costello 2020 in many cases the linear frequency domain potential flow theory is utilized because of its simplicity and computational efficiency although the linear theory is expected to be sufficient to describe small motions induced by small amplitude waves wecs are often subject to many nonlinearities such as those arising from steep incident waves large amplitude motions complex mooring arrangements power take off pto systems and viscous drag forces in this case the linear frequency domain model may not provide an accurate representation of the actual system dynamics as an alternative time domain models are often used to take into account these nonlinear factors babarit et al 2012 wolgamot and fitzgerald 2015 schubert et al 2020 in particular for point absorbers the nonlinear froude krylov model gilloteaux et al 2007 merigaud et al 2012 giorgi and ringwood 2017 is usually adopted in which nonlinear froude krylov forces and hydrostatic restoring forces are obtained by integrating the pressure of undisturbed incoming waves and the hydrostatic pressure over the instantaneous wetted body surface respectively whereas diffraction and radiation forces remain linear and are separately calculated over the mean wetted body surface as in the linear model the diffraction force is written by a convolution between the diffraction impulse response function and the incident wave elevation at a given reference point according to the cummins equation cummins 1962 the radiation force can be expressed by the infinite frequency added mass term and a convolution of the radiation impulse response function with the velocity of the body the nonlinear froude krylov model is essentially an extension of the linear model referred to as the partially nonlinear model and has been widely utilized by guerinel et al 2013 tarrant and meskell 2016 and penalba et al 2017b however this partially nonlinear model does not take into account the nonlinearities arising from diffraction and radiation forces some fully nonlinear potential flow fnpf models have also been developed guerber et al 2012 abbasnia and guedes soares 2018 kim and koo 2019 as well as computational fluid dynamics cfd models e g windt et al 2018 dafnakis et al 2020 nevertheless both the fnpf and cfd models are still time consuming for practical applications and have some shortcomings in terms of remeshing algorithms and robustness therefore a nonlinear weak scatterer approach may be a good alternative which was firstly proposed by pawlowski 1992 and subsequently developed by kim and kim 2009 for nonlinear ship motions in this approach the scattered wave component is assumed to be small relative to the incident one which can usually be satisfied provided that the horizontal dimensions of the structure are sufficiently small compared to the incident wavelength in this case fully nonlinear free surface conditions may be linearized at the incident wave elevation there are no restrictions on the incident waves except that they are non breaking and thus the case of nonlinear steep incident waves can also be handled the body surface condition is satisfied at the exact body position so that large amplitude body motions can be considered if the weak scatterer approximation is well satisfied this approach is expected to be accurate for small to large amplitude body motions and can be applied to the condition of incident waves with large steepness furthermore this approach is beneficial to remeshing algorithms this is because if the horizontal position of the free surface nodes has been obtained the vertical position of them can be explicitly known at each time step as a result this approach is expected to be more stable than the fully nonlinear method in which the position of the free surface nodes is one of the unknowns to the best of our knowledge although many applications in marine renewable energy industry satisfy the condition of the weak scatterer approximation particularly the point absorber wecs and monopile supported offshore wind turbines only a few numerical models have been established by utilizing this kind of approximation so far a weakly nonlinear model was developed by letournel et al 2014 2018 for submerged bodies and it was applied to two submerged wecs i e the ceto and waveroller devices then chauvigné et al 2015 extended the model to deal with diffraction and radiation problems of a surface piercing vertical cylinder in their numerical model the boundary element method bem was used for solving the boundary value problem and linear triangular elements were adopted afterwards applying the weak scatterer approximation and the higher order boundary element method hobem a novel time domain nonlinear potential flow model was proposed by zhang and teng 2019 2021 to investigate the higher harmonic wave forces and ringing response of a monopile in this paper we further extend the numerical model proposed in zhang and teng 2019 2021 to simulate wave interaction with surface piercing floating bodies both in steep regular waves and focused waves an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach is adopted in the process of time marching to accommodate to large amplitude motions of the floating body two efficient algorithms have been integrated in the numerical model to deal with mesh deformations in this way the computational mesh can be adapted to the varying geometry of the free surface and moving body surface the aim of the present paper is to gain further insight into the numerical modelling of the nonlinear interaction between steep waves and floating bodies while maintaining a rational amount of computation time as a realistic example special focus is given to a simplified point absorber wec presented in ransley et al 2017 the simplified wec consists of a floating cylindrical buoy with a hemispherical bottom a single tether and a pto system the hydrodynamic performance of the wec is extensively investigated in regular waves with a series of wave frequencies and wave steepnesses and the influence of the pto damping coefficient on the performance is discussed in addition the survivability analysis of the wec in extreme wave events is carried out to further verify the capacity and accuracy of the present numerical model in simulating extreme wave interaction with floating bodies the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the mathematical formulation of the problem and section 3 describes the details on the numerical implementation of the present model the performance evaluation of a point absorber wec is introduced in section 4 including the theoretical analysis built upon the linear theory in the frequency domain in section 5 numerical simulations are firstly carried out for the wec in regular waves the hydrodynamic performance of the wec is extensively investigated with various wave frequencies wave steepnesses and pto damping coefficients numerical results of the motion response of the wec the mean absorbed power the absorption efficiency and the pto force are obtained and compared with the results from the linear frequency domain model afterwards the interaction of steep focused wave groups with the floating buoy is simulated and comparisons with the published experimental data and other numerical solutions are provided in terms of the motion responses of the buoy and the mooring force the time frequency characteristics of the motion responses are further analysed based on wavelet transforms finally some conclusions are given in section 6 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 boundary value problem based on weak scatterer approximation as shown in fig 1 a three dimensional fluid domain d is considered which is bounded by a body surface s b a free surface s f a flat bottom surface s d and a far field boundary surface s r we define two right handed cartesian coordinate systems one is the space fixed coordinate system oxyz with the origin o on the still water surface and its z axis pointing vertically upwards and the other is the body fixed coordinate system o x y z with its origin o placed at the body s centre of mass when the body is at its rest position these two coordinate systems are parallel to each other and the centre of mass is initially located at x c x c y c z c in the space fixed coordinate system in this study we introduce a translational vector ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 to denote the displacements of surge sway and heave and a rotational vector θ α β γ ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 to illustrate the angles of roll pitch and yaw respectively thus the relationship between the two sets of coordinate systems can be expressed as 1 x y z x c y c z c ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 t x y z where t is the transformation matrix ma 1998 2 t cos β cos γ cos β sin γ sin β sin α sin β cos γ cos α sin γ sin α sin β sin γ cos α cos γ sin α cos β cos α sin β cos γ sin α sin γ cos α sin β sin γ sin α cos γ cos α cos β within the framework of potential flow theory the fluid motion is assumed to be irrotational and it can be described by a velocity potential φ x y z t which satisfies the laplace s equation within the fluid domain d 3 2 φ 0 the kinematic and dynamic conditions on the instantaneous free surface s f are written as 4 η t φ z φ η 5 φ t g η 1 2 φ φ where η is the free surface elevation and g is the gravitational acceleration the boundary condition on the wetted body surface s b is given as 6 φ n v b n where n is the unit normal vector pointing out of the fluid domain and v b is the velocity vector of a point on the body surface which can be written as 7 v b u ω r b where u ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 is the translational velocity ω ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 is the angular velocity and r b is the position vector of a point on the body surface with respect to the centre of mass on the seabed surface s d the impermeability condition is expressed as 8 φ n 0 in addition an appropriate radiation condition should be defined to avoid the unwanted wave reflection from the far field boundary surface s r which will be discussed later in this study the technique of flow decomposition e g ferrant 1998 ferrant et al 2003 is utilized here the total velocity potential and free surface elevation φ η are split into two parts which are referred to as the incident φ i η i and the scattered φ s η s components the incident components represent the undisturbed incoming wave whereas the scattered components take into account the influence of the structure inside the domain including diffraction and radiation effects the advantages of this separating technique have been specifically introduced in ducrozet et al 2014 and thus are not are not elaborated here furthermore the weak scatterer approximation pawlowski 1992 is adopted assuming that the scattered components are small relative to the incident ones i e 9 φ φ i φ s φ s φ i η η i η s η s η i here φ i and η i are assumed to be known explicitly the expression of them can be obtained by a dedicated wave model for example we can adopt a stream function model rienecker and fenton 1981 for simulating nonlinear regular waves and the high order spectral method ducrozet et al 2016 or the second order stokes type theory dalzell 1999 can be used for irregular waves therefore only the scattered components φ s and η s need to be solved in this study in the light of the weak scatterer approximation the free surface boundary conditions can be linearized at the incident wave elevation z η i x y t under the first order approximation of taylor expansion an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach is introduced to track the free surface nodes and accommodate to large amplitude motions of the floating body thus we define a particular time derivative operator as 10 δ δ t t v mesh the mesh velocity v mesh is defined so that the free surface nodes move with the body motion in the horizontal direction and they move with the variation of the incident free surface vertically and the calculation of v mesh will be outlined in section 3 3 introducing the flow decomposition technique and weak scatterer approximation into the free surface equations i e eqs 4 and 5 leads to the following equations 11 δ η s δ t φ s z φ i v mesh η s φ s η i η s 2 φ i z 2 η i φ i z ν r η s at z η i x y t 12 δ φ s δ t g η s φ i v mesh φ s η s z φ i t 1 2 φ i φ i ν r φ s at z η i x y t in eqs 11 and 12 the terms involving φ i and η i are represented as forcing terms and the value of which can be obtained through the dedicated incident wave model in order to avoid the reflection of scattered waves from the far field boundary and achieve a long time simulation in a reasonably sized domain an artificial damping layer has been included on the free surface near the far field boundary to absorb the scattered wave energy following the approach of bai and eatock taylor 2006 the damping coefficient ν r is chosen as 13 ν r α 0 ω r r 0 β 0 λ 2 r 0 r r d r 0 β 0 λ 0 r r 0 where r denotes the horizontal distance from the origin ω is the characteristic wave frequency λ is the characteristic wavelength and r d is the radius of the free surface computational domain the non dimensional parameters α 0 and β 0 are both determined to be 1 0 in this study within the fluid domain the scattered velocity potential φ s satisfies the laplace s equation and on the wetted body surface it is now subject to the neumann condition as 14 φ s n φ i n v b n on s b in addition the initial conditions on the free surface are imposed as 15 φ s 0 η s 0 at t 0 2 2 higher order boundary element method on the basis of green s second identity the aforementioned nonlinear boundary value problem for the scattered velocity potential φ s can be transformed into an integral equation over the whole boundary s as 16 α x 0 φ s x 0 s φ s x g x x 0 n g x x 0 φ s x n d s where x 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 and x x y z are the coordinates of the source and field points respectively α x 0 is the interior solid angle at the point x 0 and g x x 0 is the green s function in this study the rankine source and its images with regard to the seabed z d is adopted as the green s function and thus the integral over the seabed is excluded afterwards the higher order boundary element method hobem is adopted to solve the boundary integral equation and the boundary surface is discretized by quadratic isoparametric elements introducing the shape function h ζ ς in each element we can write the coordinate the velocity potential and its normal derivative within an element in terms of nodal values as 17 x ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς x k φ s ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς φ s k φ s n ζ ς k 1 k h k ζ ς φ s k n where ζ ς denotes the local intrinsic coordinates x k φ s k φ s k n and h k represent the nodal coordinate the velocity potential its normal derivative and the shape function corresponding to the kth node within the element and k is the total number of nodes in the element i e six and eight for triangular and quadrilateral elements respectively furthermore the computation of solid angle and singular integrals have been described in zhang and teng 2021 and thus is not elaborated here finally the resulting discretized algebraic equations can be written in the following matrix form as 18 a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 x 1 x 2 b 1 b 2 in which x 1 and x 2 contain the unknown nodal velocity potentials on the body surface and nodal normal derivatives of the velocity potential on the free surface respectively a is the influence coefficient matrix and b is a column vector obtained from the known terms the specific expression of which can be referred to zhang and teng 2021 in order to obtain the solution of the system of equations we make use of the efficient generalized minimal residual gmres iterative scheme saad and schultz 1986 with a diagonal preconditioner in the present study from the corresponding boundary conditions and the solution of the boundary value problem we can know the velocity potential φ s and its normal derivative φ s n on the entire boundary of the fluid domain thus the particle velocities φ s both on the body surface and free surface can be easily determined by 19 φ s x φ s y φ s z x ζ y ζ z ζ x ς y ς z ς n x n y n z 1 φ s ζ φ s ς φ s n where n x n y n z are the components of the unit normal vector and they can be expressed as 20 n x j 1 j n y j 2 j n z j 3 j where 21 j 1 y ζ z ς z ζ y ς 22 j 2 z ζ x ς x ζ z ς 23 j 3 x ζ y ς y ζ x ς 24 j j 1 2 j 2 2 j 3 2 the derivatives of x x y z and φ s with respect to ζ and ς in the above formulas can be simply obtained from differentiation of the shape function based on eq 17 2 3 motion response of the floating buoy for the floating buoy the equation of motion is written as 25 m ξ b ξ f h m h f pto m pto f g 0 where m is the 6 6 generalized mass matrix and b is a linearized viscous damping matrix which is introduced to incorporate the viscous effect that is ignored in the potential flow theory as outlined in section 2 3 3 ξ and ξ denote the velocity and acceleration vectors of the buoy respectively which are the 6 1 column vectors including all the translational and rotational motions f h and m h denote the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the floating buoy it should be emphasized that the hydrostatic forces and moments are also included in the expression of f h and m h described in section 2 3 1 f pto and m pto are the pto forces and moments exerted on the buoy which are described in detail in section 2 3 2 in addition f g m g k is the gravity of the buoy where m is the mass of the buoy and k is the unit vector along the z axis 2 3 1 hydrodynamic forces the pressure on the body can be obtained from the bernoulli s equation 26 p ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z afterwards the hydrodynamic forces f h f h 1 f h 2 f h 3 and moments m h f h 4 f h 5 f h 6 on the body are calculated by integrating the pressure over its instantaneous wetted surface in addition the integrals over the exact wetted body surface s b are divided into two parts one is over the wetted body surface s b w bounded by the incident wave profile the other is converted to waterline integrals by taylor expansion at the incident wave elevation i e 27 f h i s b p n i d s ρ s b w φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z n i d s ρ γ η s φ t 1 2 φ 2 1 2 g 2 η i η s η s 2 n i d l i 1 6 where ρ is the fluid density n 1 n 2 n 3 n and n 4 n 5 n 6 r b n it is worth noting that the particle velocities φ on the body surface in eq 27 can be obtained numerically however accurate calculation of φ t is rather difficult particularly in the case of freely moving bodies in this study we apply a novel backward difference approach with the consideration of grid motion by using the time derivative operator δ δ t t v mesh φ t can be written as 28 φ t φ i t φ s t φ i t δ φ s δ t v mesh φ s where v mesh is the mesh velocity on the body surface and δ φ s δ t is computed by a conventional difference scheme using the velocity potential φ s at the present and previous time steps 2 3 2 pto forces in this study the floating buoy is attached to the sea floor through a single tether with one end attached to the bottom of the buoy and the other end anchored at the sea floor as shown in fig 2 under wave action the buoy can move in six degrees of freedom 6 dof and the motion of the buoy is restrained by the tether the wave energy can be extracted from the oscillating motion of the buoy by using a pto system as shown in fig 2 the pto system is installed along the tether and modelled approximately as a linear spring damper system as a result the pto forces f pto exerted on the buoy act along the tether and can be written as 29 f pto f pto l a b l a b where f pto denotes the magnitude of the pto force tether tension l a b denotes the instantaneous tether vector from the anchor point a to the attachment point b and represents the magnitude of the vector in general f pto consists of a pre tension force that counteracts the buoy s net buoyancy force i e ρ g m g in which is the displaced water volume of the buoy at the rest position a spring force proportional to the tether extension δ l and a damping force proportional to the rate of change of tether extension δ l i e 30 f pto t 0 k m δ l b pto δ l where t 0 is the static pre tension force k m is the mechanical stiffness coefficient and b p t o is the pto damping coefficient including all the translational motions ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 and rotational motions ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 of the buoy the full expression for tether extension can be written as 31 δ l ξ 1 h sin ξ 5 2 ξ 2 h cos ξ 5 sin ξ 4 2 ξ 3 l 0 h 1 cos ξ 5 cos ξ 4 2 l 0 where h is the distance between the buoy s centre of mass and the attachment point and l 0 is the initial static tether length when the buoy is at the rest position considering that the buoy and the incoming wave are symmetric about the x z plane only 3 dof motions i e surge heave and pitch are considered here thus eq 31 is simplified as 32 δ l ξ 1 h sin ξ 5 2 ξ 3 l 0 h 1 cos ξ 5 2 l 0 the rate of change of the tether extension can then be derived as 33 δ l ξ 1 h sin ξ 5 ξ 1 h ξ 5 cos ξ 5 ξ 3 l 0 h 1 cos ξ 5 ξ 3 h ξ 5 sin ξ 5 ξ 1 h sin ξ 5 2 ξ 3 l 0 h 1 cos ξ 5 2 the moments arising from the pto forces are given as 34 m pto r m f pto where r m denotes the position vector from the buoy s centre of mass to the attachment point 2 3 3 viscous damping matrix we know that the overall fluid damping of a floating buoy mainly consists of two parts one is the inviscid radiation damping and the other is the viscous damping arising from the viscous friction and vortex shedding bhinder et al 2011 jin and patton 2017 the level of the viscous damping is quite difficult to be determined accurately which is beyond the scope of the potential flow theory as an alternative a linearized viscous damping matrix b is introduced to incorporate the viscous effect and the value of which can be obtained from a free decay test in still water in this study the total fluid damping matrix is expressed in terms of rayleigh damping and the diagonal terms of the viscous damping matrix are determined by subtracting the radiation damping from the total fluid damping i e b i i α i m i i a i i b i i where α i 2 ζ i ω n i is the total damping factor ω n i and ζ i are the natural frequency and damping ratio of the body in the ith mode of motion which can be estimated from a free decay test in still water in the absence of pto damping a i i and b i i are the corresponding added mass and radiation damping coefficients which can be simply obtained from a frequency domain potential flow solver teng and eatock taylor 1995 the off diagonal terms in the viscous damping matrix are assumed to be zero 3 numerical implementation 3 1 time stepping scheme after solving the boundary value problem and obtaining the particle velocities on the free surface we can update the free surface geometry and velocity potential for the computation at the next time step by integrating the nonlinear free surface conditions in time in this study the fourth order runge kutta rk4 time integration scheme is adopted together with the ale approach which provides good stability and accuracy in order to avoid an abrupt initial condition a cosine ramp function is applied to the incident wave field when the numerical simulation is started and the expression of which is the same as bai and eatock taylor 2006 it makes the simulation more stable and reach the steady state earlier 3 2 waterline node tracking during the simulation the position of the waterline varies with time due to the propagation of the incident wave and the body motion in order to ensure that the waterline node remains on the intersection between the incident free surface and the exact body surface its position is required to be tracked and updated in real time in this study the shape of the buoy is regular which consists of a cylinder on the top and a hemisphere at the bottom as shown in fig 1 applying the expression of the cylindrical and spherical surface the horizontal coordinates of the nth waterline node in the body fixed coordinate system can be written as 35 x w n r cos θ n y w n r sin θ n if z w n z s 36 x w n r 2 z w n z s 2 cos θ n y w n r 2 z w n z s 2 sin θ n if z w n z s where r is the radius of the buoy θ n is the circumferential angle which is uniformly distributed in the body fixed coordinate system z w n and z s are the body fixed vertical coordinates of the nth waterline node and the centre of sphere respectively substituting eq 35 or eq 36 into eq 1 and combining it with z w n η i x w n y w n t this leads to a nonlinear equation about z w n which can be solved by the iteration method with aitken acceleration i e the steffensen iteration method once the body fixed coordinates x w n y w n z w n are known the space fixed coordinates of the nth waterline node can be obtained by eq 1 so that the tracking and updating of waterline nodes are achieved with time 3 3 mesh deformation and interpolation the geometry of the fluid domain varies with the free surface elevation and the exact position of the body therefore it is necessary to adapt the computational mesh at each time step according to these deformations in order to avoid remeshing the entire computational domain at each time step we have integrated two efficient mesh deformation algorithms to make it possible to maintain high mesh quality and the same mesh topology during the deformation as shown in fig 3 the body surface nodes are assumed to be uniformly distributed along the circumferential direction in the body fixed coordinate system and the mesh connectivity remains unchanged during the deformation of body mesh in the body fixed coordinate system once the vertical coordinate of the internal node is updated with the variation of the intersection between the free surface and the body surface to adapt to the deformation the corresponding horizontal coordinates of the node can be similarly determined by eq 35 or eq 36 in this way only the vertical displacement of the node needs to be specified which is simply given as 37 δ z m n δ z w n f s d where δ z w n is the vertical displacement of the nth waterline node which can be obtained by the difference between the new and initial vertical coordinates and f s d denotes the displacement distribution along the vertical direction which is assumed to be sinusoidal and written as 38 f s d m 0 5 1 cos ϕ m 2 0 25 1 cos ϕ m 39 ϕ m m 1 π 2 m in which m 1 2 m 1 and m is the number of elements in the vertical direction it indicates that f s d 0 at the bottom of the buoy i e m 1 and f s d 1 at the waterline i e m 2 m 1 which satisfy the displacement condition at the boundary it is proved that the sinusoidal type displacement distribution is capable of achieving a good quality of the deformed body mesh then the new vertical coordinate of the node can be updated by 40 z m n new z m n initial δ z m n where z m n initial denotes the vertical coordinate of the node at the initial time once the body fixed coordinates of the body surface nodes are known the space fixed coordinates of which can be obtained by eq 1 and the updating of the mesh on the body surface are achieved for the deformation of the mesh on the free surface a spring analogy method blom 2000 is commonly used to accommodate to the body motion in the computational domain which can be found in ma and yan 2009 and zhou et al 2015 nevertheless it needs to solve a large system of linear equations whose size is near the total number of grid nodes on the free surface and thus will be very time consuming if the number of the free surface nodes is quite large therefore a mesh deformation algorithm based on radial basis function rbf interpolation proposed by de boer et al 2007 is applied here as an alternative the prominent advantages and numerical implementation of the rbf interpolation method have been specifically introduced in zhang and teng 2021 and thus are not elaborated here for simplicity we firstly project the free surface nodes onto the horizontal plane and then move them around in this plane by using the rbf interpolation method provided that the displacement of the boundary nodes i e waterline nodes and outer boundary nodes has been known this leads to the new horizontal coordinates for the free surface nodes afterwards the horizontal velocities of the nodes can be easily obtained from the displacement moreover an additional condition should be imposed on the node velocity to ensure that the nodes on the free surface still stay on this surface i e 41 v mesh n φ i n according to the new horizontal coordinates of the free surface nodes the scattered wave elevation η s and velocity potential φ s at the new node can be computed by an interpolation scheme as described in zhang and teng 2021 3 4 schematic summary of numerical algorithm as shown in fig 4 a flow chart is presented here to briefly summarize the above contents and illustrate the numerical computation process for the sake of better descriptions some explanations about the major components of the numerical algorithm are given below 1 calculate the expressions of the incident wave based on a dedicated wave model 2 track waterline nodes in real time 3 update computational grids on the body and free surface by two efficient mesh deformation algorithms and then update η s and φ s on the free surface by an interpolation scheme 4 solve the boundary integral equation bie using hobem 5 calculate the hydrodynamic forces and obtain the motion responses of the buoy 6 update the time step and repeat steps 1 5 4 performance evaluation of the wave energy converter as shown in fig 2 the floating buoy is designed to extract wave energy from its oscillating motion induced by ocean waves using a pto system installed along the tether in marine renewable energy terminology the device can be regarded as a point absorber wec since the horizontal extension of the buoy is usually small relative to the representative wavelength owing to the axisymmetry of the buoy power can be effectively extracted from ocean waves regardless of the direction of incidence referring to ding et al 2018 and orszaghova et al 2019 the wave power is primarily extracted from the buoy s heave motion since the other modes are only weakly coupled to the pto system due to the kinematic constraint of the single tether pto arrangement in their linear frequency domain analysis only the heave mode is considered to extract wave power at the linearized approximation however the wave power extracted from the buoy s 3 dof oscillating motions can be directly evaluated by the present nonlinear time domain model and thus the influence of nonlinear surge pitch coupling on the actual performance of the multi mode wec can be incorporated by comparing the results of these two numerical models the limitations of the linear model can be clearly seen the time averaged absorbed power of the wec over one wave period t is defined as 42 p abs 1 t t t t b p t o δ l 2 d t for a regular wave the mean wave energy flux per unit width of wave crest is given as 43 p w 1 2 ρ g a 2 c g in which a is the incident wave amplitude and c g is the group velocity which represents the energy transportation speed of the wave and can be expressed as 44 c g ω 2 k 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d where ω is the angular frequency k is the wavenumber and d is the water depth the capture width ratio i e absorption efficiency of the wec in regular waves can subsequently be defined as 45 c w p abs p w 2 r where 2r is the characteristic scale of the wec in this study r is the radius of the buoy 4 1 linear frequency domain analysis assuming small translational and rotational motions the equation of motion can be linearized at the rest position of the buoy within the framework of linear hydrodynamics in the frequency domain the diffraction and radiation problems are decoupled in this way the equation of motion for the wec can be written as 46 m a ω ξ b pto b b ω ξ k pto c ξ f exc where m is the mass matrix of the buoy a ω and b ω denote the frequency dependent added mass and radiation damping matrix respectively b is the linearized viscous damping matrix as outlined in section 2 3 3 c is the stiffness matrix arising from the hydrostatic restoring force k pto and b p t o are the linearized pto stiffness and damping matrix respectively which can be written as 47 k pto t 0 l 0 0 0 0 t 0 h l 0 0 0 t 0 l 0 0 t 0 h l 0 0 0 0 0 k m 0 0 0 0 t 0 h l 0 0 t 0 h 1 h l 0 0 0 t 0 h l 0 0 0 0 t 0 h 1 h l 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 48 b p t o 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 b p t o 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 it is noted that the pto stiffness matrix k pto depends on the initial tether length l 0 the pre tension force of the tether t 0 the stiffness coefficient k m and the distance between the buoy s centre of mass and the tether attachment point on the buoy i e h whereas the pto damping matrix b p t o is only dependent on the pto damping coefficient b p t o f e x c is the vector of linear wave excitation forces and ξ ξ and ξ denote the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors of the buoy respectively eq 48 implies that under the kinematic constraint of the single tether pto arrangement and the linearized approximation only the heave mode is applied to produce power thus in accordance with eq 46 the equation of heave motion of the wec can be written as 49 m 33 a 33 ξ 3 b p t o λ 33 ξ 3 k 33 c 33 ξ 3 f e 3 where m 33 is the mass of the buoy a 33 is the added mass in heave mode λ 33 b 33 b 33 denotes the total hydrodynamic damping coefficient in heave mode with the viscous effect considered in which b 33 is the inviscid radiation damping coefficient and b 33 is the linearized viscous damping coefficient k 33 and c 33 are coefficients of the pto stiffness matrix and the hydrostatic restoring force in heave mode respectively here k 33 k m based on eq 47 and c 33 ρ g a w p where a w p is the water plane area of the buoy in a monochromatic wave assuming the variables are time harmonic with an angular frequency ω the vertical wave excitation force f e 3 and the heave response ξ 3 can be written as 50 f e 3 t re f e 3 e i ω t 51 ξ 3 t re χ 3 e i ω t where f e 3 and χ 3 are the complex amplitudes of the wave excitation force and motion response in heave mode respectively and re represents the real part of a complex variable to be considered then from eq 49 the amplitude of heave motion of the wec can be expressed as 52 χ 3 f e 3 m 33 a 33 ω 2 k 33 c 33 2 ω 2 b p t o λ 33 2 in which represents the modulus of the complex variable the mean absorbed power of the wec defined in eq 42 can now be written as 53 p abs 1 2 b p t o ω 2 χ 3 2 excluding the excitation and damping terms in eq 49 the undamped natural frequency of the wec in heave mode can be obtained by 54 ω n 3 k 33 c 33 m 33 a 33 ω n 3 as a reactive control strategy falnes 2002 the natural frequency of the wec can be tuned within limits to the characteristic frequency of incoming waves by adjusting the mechanical stiffness coefficient to achieve resonance which is usually utilized to maximize the wave power absorption using p abs b p t o 0 the optimal pto damping coefficient is given as 55 b p t o opt m 33 a 33 ω 2 k 33 c 33 2 ω 2 λ 33 2 from eq 55 we can know that when ω ω n 3 b p t o opt λ 33 this leads to the maximum time averaged absorbed power at resonance 56 p abs max f e 3 2 8 λ 33 using the haskind relation between the wave excitation force and the radiation damping in heave mode falnes 2002 57 f e 3 2 4 k ρ g a 2 c g b 33 and substituting eqs 56 and 43 into eq 45 the maximum capture width ratio can be given as 58 c w max 1 k res 1 f vis 2 r where k res is the wavenumber at resonance and f vis b 33 b 33 is the ratio of viscous damping to radiation damping note that if the viscous effect is assumed to be neglected i e f vis 0 then c w max 1 k res 2 r this is corresponding to the well known theoretical result of inviscid fluid obtained independently by budal and falnes 1975 newman 1976 and evans 1976 on the maximum power i e p abs max p w k that can be absorbed from the waves by an axisymmetric heaving buoy under the assumption of unconstrained motion 5 numerical results and discussion 5 1 experimental and numerical setup the wave energy device considered in this study is the same as that adopted in the experiment of ransley et al 2017 which comprises a cylindrical buoy with a hemispherical bottom and a linearly elastic mooring see fig 5 the experiment was carried out in the coast laboratory ocean basin at the university of plymouth uk the basin is 35 m long and 15 5 m wide with 24 flap type wave paddles installed at one end and a parabolic beach at the other end the water depth was set at 2 8 m in the region where the buoy was placed as shown in fig 5 the buoy consists of a cylinder on the top and a hemisphere at the bottom which has a diameter d 2r 0 5 m the total mass of the buoy is 43 2 kg and the centre of mass is located at 0 181 m above the bottom of the buoy i e h 0 181 m the moment of inertia of the buoy is 1 61 1 61 0 5 kg m2 in addition a single point mooring was used in the experiment to restrain the motion of the buoy with one end attached to the bottom of the buoy and the other end fixed at the basin floor the mooring line is simplified as a linear spring which has a stiffness coefficient of 67 n m and a rest length of 2 18 m according to the initial static equilibrium condition the pre tension force and initial length of the mooring line can be determined i e t 0 20 84 n l 0 2 491 m the viscous effect which is neglected in the potential flow theory is also incorporated in the simulation as mentioned in section 2 3 3 the total damping factor can be estimated from the experimental free decay signals see ransley et al 2017 of the buoy in still water by using the logarithmic decrement method and then the viscous damping is determined by subtracting the corresponding radiation damping from the total fluid damping following this method the viscous damping coefficient of the buoy in heave mode is determined to be 5 1 kg s and the ratio of viscous damping to radiation damping is about 0 14 at the resonance frequency i e f vis 0 14 this reveals that the hemispherical bottom shape leads to relatively small viscous dissipation since the bottom surface is smooth and lack of sharp edges or corners that are responsible for the flow separation and vortex shedding compared to a flat bottom with sharp edges the hemispherical bottom will amplify the motion response of the buoy and thus will improve the power absorption efficiency which has been demonstrated in jin and patton 2017 5 2 regular wave tests in this section the hydrodynamic performance of the wec in regular waves is extensively investigated with various wave frequencies and wave steepnesses and the influence of the pto damping coefficient on the performance is discussed in this study a linear frequency domain model teng and eatock taylor 1995 is firstly implemented fig 6 gives the hydrodynamic coefficients and wave excitation force in heave mode it is noted that the reactive control strategy falnes 2002 is not implemented here for simplicity and the stiffness coefficient of k m 67 n m is fixed in the numerical calculations with different wave frequencies thus the natural frequency ω n 3 of the wec is estimated to be 5 86 rad s based on eq 54 as well as the value of a 33 shown in fig 6 a which is corresponding to the non dimensional wavenumber kr 0 875 according to the linear frequency domain analysis described in section 4 1 the optimal pto damping coefficient b p t o opt is equal to the total fluid damping at resonance which is about 41 52 kg s fig 7 shows the heave rao mean absorbed power and capture width ratio of the wec against kr with different pto damping coefficients in which ν b p t o b p t o opt is the normalized pto damping coefficient it appears that the heave rao mean absorbed power and capture width ratio reach the peak value almost simultaneously at the resonance frequency and the resonance frequency decreases as the pto damping coefficient increases as expected the heave rao decreases with increasing the pto damping coefficient and the peak values of the mean absorbed power and capture width ratio are maximized for ν 1 0 which is in line with the theoretical analysis described in section 4 1 nevertheless it can be seen from fig 7 c that the effective frequency bandwidth of the wec i e the frequency range within which the capture width ratio is larger than a reference value e g 20 becomes wider with the increase of the pto damping coefficient which is beneficial to improving the overall performance of the wec in realistic sea states with broad banded spectra other approaches such as the control strategy could also widen the effective frequency bandwidth and improve the wave power extraction which is beyond the scope of this paper afterwards the nonlinear time domain model is adopted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the wec and the numerical results are compared to the linear ones a relatively comprehensive comparison is provided with regard to a series of kr from 0 25 to 1 5 three different wave steepnesses i e ε ka 0 10 0 15 and 0 20 are considered for each wave frequency to investigate the effect of nonlinearity as outlined in section 2 1 the stream function model rienecker and fenton 1981 is utilized here to simulate nonlinear incident regular waves for the wave buoy interaction the convergence study of computational mesh and time step is firstly implemented in each simulation several different time steps have been tested and δ t t 100 where t is the characteristic wave period is found to be accurate enough for the following cases furthermore appropriate computational grids are chosen to achieve the best compromise between accuracy and computational effort fig 8 shows an example of the initial computational mesh using 1116 elements and 3473 nodes on the buoy and free surface in general the radius of the free surface computational domain is chosen as r d 2 λ where λ is the wavelength moreover an annular damping layer with a distance of near one wavelength is imposed on the outer region of the free surface to prevent wave reflections the radial length of the free surface element gradually increases towards the outer boundary since the scattered waves decay with the increase of the distance from the buoy this leads to a significant reduction of the computational effort in this study the simulation of each case took approximately 0 7 h of cpu time per wave period running on a desktop of six intel core i7 8700k cpu 3 70 ghz processors in the nonlinear time domain results transient effects for each simulation have been discarded to ensure that the steady state operation of the wec is considered fig 9 shows the performance of the wec in the frequency domain with b p t o 41 52 kg s i e ν 1 0 including the normalized mean absorbed power and the capture width ratio it appears that the present numerical results are quite consistent with the linear results in the condition of small wave steepness nevertheless the discrepancy gradually increases with increasing wave steepness especially in the range of kr 0 875 1 25 and at around kr 0 625 it may be due to that the influence of nonlinear surge pitch coupling on the performance of the multi mode wec is incorporated in the present nonlinear time domain model as shown in eq 33 whereas only the heave mode is considered to extract wave power at the linearized approximation in the linear frequency domain model note that kr 0 625 is near the resonance frequency in pitch mode and thus the pitch response of the wec becomes to be large at kr 0 625 it can be known that the large pitch response has a significant effect on the pto velocity and mean absorbed power based on eqs 33 and 42 fig 10 shows the time series of the normalized instantaneous power absorbed by the pto damper at kr 0 625 and 0 875 with different wave steepness it can be seen that the steady state operation of the wec has been achieved after 30 periods the phase shift of the results with different wave steepness arises from the difference in the horizontal equilibrium position of the wec actually the equilibrium position of the wec is influenced by the slow drift in surge mode which is closely related with the wave steepness moreover the instantaneous power absorbed by the pto damper at kr 0 625 seems to have more higher order harmonics compared with that at kr 0 875 this is due to that the near resonant pitch response at kr 0 625 plays an important role in the overall performance of the wec whereas at kr 0 875 the heave mode dominates the absorption of wave power however for the normalized maximum dynamic pto force tether tension shown in fig 11 the significant discrepancy arises between the present results and the linear results with the increase of wave steepness for large kr conditions the discrepancy is primarily due to the slow drift of the wec in surge mode since the natural frequency of the wec in surge mode is quite small note that the present nonlinear time domain model is able to capture the slow drift phenomenon whereas the linear frequency domain model cannot capture it it is easy to know from eq 32 that the peak value of the tether extension increases with the slow drift of the wec and the slow drift significantly increases with the increase of the wave steepness ka and the non dimensional wavenumber kr therefore the normalized dynamic pto force mainly the component of spring force proportional to the tether extension significantly increases with the increase of wave steepness in addition the near resonant pitch response around kr 0 625 leads to a large contribution to the tether extension which also plays an important role in the discrepancy between the present results and the linear results for instance fig 12 shows the time series of the normalized dynamic pto force at kr 0 625 and 0 875 with different wave steepness it can be seen that the mean value of the dynamic pto force is gradually away from zero and the peak value increases significantly with the increase of wave steepness accurate estimation of the slow drift motion is an important criterion for designing a robust pto system for the single tethered wec furthermore the influence of the pto damping coefficient on the performance of the wec is investigated fig 13 shows the heave rao and capture width ratio of the wec at resonance i e kr 0 875 with various pto damping coefficients it is expected that the heave rao decreases with the increase of pto damping coefficients and has little relation with wave steepness for the capture width ratio the present numerical results are quite consistent with the linear results in the condition of small wave steepness it is seen from fig 13 b that the capture width ratio increases firstly and then decreases with the increase of pto damping coefficients and it achieves its maximum at b p t o b p t o opt 1 0 which is in line with the theoretical analysis described in section 4 1 nevertheless the optimal pto damping coefficient predicted by the linear theory does not result in an optimal performance for steeper waves it appears that as the wave steepness increases the maximum absorption efficiency of the wec occurs in a larger pto damping coefficient relative to that predicted by the linear theory 5 3 focused wave tests in addition to the performance of the wec during the steady state operation the survivability of the wec in extreme wave events is also a critical issue in the practical design in order to assess the most extreme device reactions during storms the interaction of steep focused wave groups with the above wave energy device was experimentally investigated in ransley et al 2017 note that the pto system was not incorporated into the experimental setup since it is generally locked under the circumstances of extreme waves to avoid damage hann et al 2015 in this section the numerical model is further validated against the laboratory measurements in order to be consistent with the experimental condition the stiffness coefficient and the pto damping coefficient are set to 67 n m and 0 kg s respectively the motion responses of the buoy and the mooring force are well reproduced and further analysed in the numerical simulation we adopt the second order stokes type theory dalzell 1999 ning et al 2009 to obtain the surface elevation and velocity potential for the incident focused wave groups i e η i and φ i to get realistic modelling of extreme wave events in the manner of a convenient design wave as ransley et al 2017 employed in the experiment the amplitudes of the individual wave components were determined by the newwave theory tromans et al 1991 as 59 a i a i s f i δ f i i 1 n s f i δ f i in which a i is the input crest amplitude i e the linear sum of the component wave amplitudes n is the total number of wave components s f i is the power spectrum and δ f i is the frequency interval in this test case the pierson moskowitz pm spectrum with the peak frequency f p 0 356 hz is adopted as shown in fig 14 a total of 120 wave components are utilized with the frequency range from 0 2 hz to 1 6 hz which covers the frequency components carrying most of the wave energy in the spectrum note that for the sake of the comparison shown below the origin of x axis in the numerical simulation is placed at 8 m forward from the wave paddle used in the experiment ransley et al 2017 employed the wave gauge measurement in the experiment at this location to serve as the input data for the inlet boundary of their openfoam model however the relevant experimental data were not specifically reported in ransley et al 2017 as a result a trial and error process is utilized here to adjust the input focal position and crest amplitude for generating the desired focused wave the input focal position and crest amplitude are determined to be x 5 2 m and a i 0 25 m respectively firstly the incident focused wave is validated in terms of the surface elevations at several spatial positions and fig 15 shows the comparison between the numerical and experimental results overall the present numerical results agree quite well with the experimental data it is seen that the main wave crest and troughs are well captured this indicates that the present model can well reproduce the incident focused wave measured in the physical experiment providing the basis for a meaningful comparison of the wave buoy interaction shown below the focused wave described above is then utilized to interact with the floating buoy the buoy is placed at x 5 49 m fig 16 shows the present numerical results for the motion responses i e surge displacement heave displacement and pitch angle of the floating buoy which are compared with the linear results the second order results the results of pic model chen et al 2019 and the experimental data overall there is a satisfying agreement between the present results and the experimental data the low frequency slow drift in the surge displacement and high frequency response in the pitch angle are well captured by the present model however the linear model is unable to predict the slow drift phenomenon in the surge displacement and thus a large discrepancy arises between the linear and experimental results the second order model improves the result to a great extent due to the consideration of second order difference frequency wave loads but still underestimates the peak value of the surge displacement the pic results and the present results are both in good agreement with the experimental data for the pitch response of the floating buoy it behaves like a free oscillation after the main wave crest has passed compared with the experimental results during this period it can be seen that the linear and second order results appear to have a significant phase shift and the pic results show a notable overestimation nevertheless the present results achieve a better agreement with the experimental data the heave displacement is primarily a linear response to the wave frequency component and the discrepancy among various results seems to be less notable further the time frequency characteristics of the motion responses of the buoy are analysed based on wavelet transforms in this paper the most widely used complex morlet wavelet is chosen applying the approach of massel 2001 we can analytically derive the relationship between the wavelet scale and the fourier frequency for the morlet wavelet the details can be referred to zhang and teng 2021 fig 17 shows the wavelet spectra of the motion responses of the buoy obtained by the present model it can be seen that the frequency components of the surge response include the significant low frequency component and the wave frequency component within the input range the heave response is primarily a linear response to the wave frequency component and the nonlinear component appears to be not notable the pitch response are mainly composed of the wave frequency and high frequency components note that after the maximum crest of focused wave groups passing through the buoy the wave motion and the induced wave excitation force become less significant whereas the significant pitch response arises at f 0 72 hz which is almost double the peak wave frequency i e f 2f p and near the natural frequency of the buoy in pitch mode this implies that the pitch response of the buoy behaves similarly to a free decay during this period and the free oscillation lasts for a long time since the damping in pitch mode is slight similarly the comparison between the linear second order pic and present numerical results for the wave loads i e surge force heave force and pitch moment on the buoy is shown in fig 18 note that the wave loads were not measured in the experiment and thus no experimental data were available for comparison it is noticed that the present results have similar trends with the second order results except that there is a clear phase shift between the results for the pitch moment this is closely related to the different phase between the results for the pitch response since the pitch moment is dominated by the radiation force after the main wave crest passing through the buoy the pic results show a notable overestimation for the heave force and pitch moment compared to other numerical results furthermore fig 19 presents the comparison for the mooring force once again the present results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data as a consequence of the good reproduction of the motion responses of the buoy it can also be seen that the mooring force shows similar trends with the heave response which implies the tether extension is dominated by the heave response in this test case finally we made a rough comparison in terms of the cpu cost on simulating the above case the present model took about 20 0 h for the 30 s simulation running on a desktop of 6 intel core i7 8700k cpu 3 70 ghz processors however it took almost 500 h of cpu time for the 28 s simulation of the same case running on 6 intel xeon cpu e5630 2 53 ghz processors for the openfoam model of ransley et al 2017 while the pic model chen et al 2019 took approximately 32 9 h for the 30 s simulation of the same case using 160 cores at the university of bath high performance computing system thus the present model leads to a significant reduction of the computational effort compared with the cfd models 6 conclusions in the light of the weak scatterer approximation a nonlinear time domain model is proposed in this paper for dealing with nonlinear wave interaction with floating bodies the corresponding boundary value problem is solved by the higher order boundary element method hobem at each time step in the process of time marching an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale approach and the fourth order runge kutta scheme are adopted on the free surface two efficient mesh deformation algorithms have been integrated in the numerical model and thus the computational mesh can be adapted to the varying geometry of the free surface and moving body surface in this way the nonlinearities arising from steep incident waves and large amplitude body motions can be taken into account and well handled by the proposed model this paper focuses on the nonlinear time domain simulations of a simplified point absorber wec which consists of a floating cylindrical buoy with a hemispherical bottom a single tether and a pto system the efficiency and survivability of the wec are analysed by the proposed numerical model in moderately steep regular waves and focused wave groups respectively the effects of wave steepness on the power absorption of the wec and the pto force are highlighted in the study of regular wave tests by comparison with a linear frequency domain model and the influence of the pto damping coefficient on the performance is discussed it appears that as the wave steepness increases accurate estimation of the slow drift motion is an important criterion for designing a robust pto system for the single tethered wec and the optimal pto damping coefficient that leads to the maximum absorption efficiency of the wec becomes larger relative to that predicted by the linear theory it is noted that the influence of nonlinear surge pitch coupling on the performance of the multi mode wec is incorporated in the present model whereas only the heave mode is considered to extract wave power at the linearized approximation in the linear frequency domain model afterwards the survivability of the wec in focused wave groups is analysed and validated against the published experimental data and other numerical results in terms of the motion responses of the buoy and the mooring force the comparisons demonstrate a satisfactory accuracy of the present model nevertheless the present model achieves the higher computational efficiency compared with the cfd models based on a rough comparison of the cpu cost on simulating the same case furthermore the time frequency characteristics of the motion responses of the buoy are further analysed based on wavelet transforms it is known that control strategies are usually utilized to widen the effective frequency bandwidth and improve the energy extraction efficiency for a practical wec particularly in irregular sea states nevertheless no pto control scheme is implemented in this study for simplicity the introduction of control algorithms into the performance evaluation of wecs can be of great importance and this

20192,as the basic unit of the ship bottom plate the stiffened plate is usually subjected to multiple loads although the compressive loads may be responsible for the ultimate state of the hull structure lateral pressure is also an essential component of loads for the bottom plate in this paper the collapse modes and ultimate strength of stiffened plates under the symmetric end condition subjected to combined axial compression and lateral loads are investigated to analyze the effect of lateral pressure results revealed that the lateral pressure could affect the ultimate strength and collapse mode by changing the pre buckling strength and the magnitude of initial deflection correspondingly the empirical formulas that contain the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure for calculating the ultimate strength are proposed to intuitively quantify the influence of lateral pressure in addition corresponding results obtained by experiments are compared with those obtained by empirical formulas and the validity of the empirical formulas was further verified keywords stiffened plate lateral pressure collapse mode ultimate strength empirical formula 1 introduction the stiffened plate is the basic unit of the ship bottom plate which is usually subjected to loads from multiple directions aiming at guaranteeing the safety of ships under severe sea conditions the ultimate states of stiffened plates need to be evaluated although the longitudinal compressive stresses may be the primary load component that would cause the collapse of the ship plate in the hogging condition the effect of lateral pressure is also considerable during the collapse process of the ship bottom plate recently the negative impact of lateral pressure on the ultimate strength has been focused on some literature tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 ma et al 2021 however the ultimate strength would also increase when the lateral pressure reaches some values in addition the collapse modes could be classified when the interesting behavior appears and then it will be convenient to identify the effect of lateral pressure on the failure mode in a word when the effect of lateral pressure inhibits or promotes the collapse process of the stiffened plate the failure modes are worth exploring during the past few years the collapse mechanism of the panels and stiffened plates has been explored in detail some empirical formulas were put forward about the panels and stiffened plates to obtain the ultimate strength effectively yang et al 2018 presented a piecewise empirical formula to evaluate the dynamic ultimate strength of rectangular plates bear axial compression with different loading speeds liu and zhang 2020 analyze the effect of rotational stiffness the aspect ratio and initial deflection on the ultimate strength of ship plates bear axial compressions then they proposed a modified empirical formula which contains the above factors hayward and lehmann 2017 presented a new formula of the load bearing capacity of plates under the biaxial loads which could capture the influences of the plate slenderness and aspect ratio kim et al 2018 reviewed the well known formula predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened plates by comparing it with analytical and fea results finally proposed the ultimate strength without considering the fluctuation behavior could be predicted by the empirical formula li et al 2021a b present an adapted algorithm to predict the stiffened plates collapse progress which extends the predicting capacity including elastic stiffness ultimate and post ultimate features the ultimate strength of stiffened plate subjected to the combined longitudinal compressive stress and lateral pressure has been studied in some literature including the corresponding numerical analysis empirical formulas and experiments yao et al 1997 explored the effect of the boundary conditions on the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under the combined action of longitudinal and lateral loads in addition a crucial conclusion was given that the ultimate strength of stiffened panels bear combined loads has few connections with the loading sequence therefore applying the lateral pressure first and keep as a constant in the second step then the axial load was applied in the second step zhang 2016 performed a comprehensive review on the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates bear axial compressions then a semi empirical equation that includes the plate slenderness and the column slenderness was presented and validated by many numerical and experimental results kim et al 2017 proposed the empirical formula for predicting the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate 2 span and 2 bay with the symmetric conditions under the longitudinal compression by considering the plate slenderness and the column slenderness xu et al 2017 explored the influence of lateral pressure on the ultimate strength they proposed that the load carrying capacity would decrease with lateral pressure increasing for the failure induced by the plate moreover a higher ultimate strength would be obtained by applying lateral pressure in the middle span to prevent the middle span from buckling furthermore some empirical formulas on the ultimate strength were proposed khedmati et al 2017 presented the empirical formula to assess the transverse ultimate strength of aluminum stiffened plates based on additional consideration of lateral loads xu et al 2018 studied the influence of the type of stiffener and the lateral pressure on the ultimate strength although the column slenderness of angle bar t bar and flat bar is identical the flexural rigidity and torsional rigidity of angle and t bar stiffener are larger which leads to a higher ultimate strength besides the empirical formulas for calculating the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under the combined loads were proposed which took into account the higher order interaction of column slenderness and plate slenderness it should be noted that the empirical formula expression could be improved in a non dimensional form the non dimensional empirical formulas could not only obtain the ultimate strength but also these formulas could give reference to the design of the scaled model subjected to multiple loads jiang and zhang 2014 2015 analyzed the impact of lateral loads on the ultimate strength they proposed that the water head of 30m would reduce the ultimate strength of stiffened plates whose thickness of the attached plate is 18 5 mm with symmetric boundary conditions under axial compression by 20 therefore lateral pressure is a crucial factor in the structure design besides the load case of layout lateral pressure at the plate would lead to local serve deformation at the intersection of the transverse frame and stiffener in contrast the lateral pressure applied at the side with stiffeners would increase the deformation of the middle span although longitudinal compressive stresses act as a leading part in the collapse process of ship plates the influence of transverse compressive stresses should not be ignored mol comfort collapsed in the hogging condition according to the investigation report on structural safety of large container ship 2014 one possible reason for this is the considerable transverse compressive stresses appearing at ship bottom plates besides tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 indicated the lateral pressure act in the ship bottom plate would also induce transverse compressive stresses the ultimate load bearing capacity is affected by transverse compressive stresses the ultimate strength of combined transverse compressive stresses and lateral pressure has also been studied fujikubo et al 2005a 2005b studied the ultimate strength of plates or stiffened panels under the combined transverse and lateral loads the relevant ultimate strength evaluation formulas were proposed respectively besides an interesting phenomenon is that the transverse ultimate strength does not usually decrease with lateral pressure increasing the main reason for this is that membrane action and material strain hardening effect guedes soares and gordo 1996 presented the ultimate strength regression equation of the stiffened panel under biaxial compression and extended the equation to the load case involving the lateral loads dier and dowling 1980 derived the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure then the influential factors including the non dimensional parameter of the lateral pressure and plate slenderness were fully considered in the formula paik and seo 2009a 2009b explore the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates under the combined biaxial and lateral loads with non linear fea the results are compared with those obtained by the alps ulsap semi analytical method to study the influence of structural dimensions initial defections and other factors on the ultimate strength moreover the degree of rotational constraints would be more considerable when the lateral pressure is applied the lateral pressure could also reduce the sensitivity of ultimate strength to the amplitude of initial deflection naruse and kawamura 2017 studied the collapse behavior of the stiffened plate subjected to biaxial compression and proposed that the larger transverse load would change the buckling mode to a single half wave which would reduce the effective length of the panel then the corresponding regression formula to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened plate subjected to biaxial compression was proposed a parameter representing the reduction of effective width a parameter representing the lateral torsional buckling of stiffeners and a parameter representing the beginning to reduce the effective width is introduced in the regression formula shi and gao 2020 studied the transverse ultimate strength of the u type stiffened plate with a symmetric boundary condition by considering the effect of the aspect ratio and plate slenderness finally the empirical formula for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under the transverse compression or combined transverse compression and lateral pressure was presented this research investigated the effect of lateral pressure on the collapse process and ultimate strength of stiffened plates with different slenderness under several combined load conditions aim to numerically evaluate the effect of lateral pressure and propose corresponding modified empirical formulas which contain the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure then the empirical formula could be regarded as an alternative assessment method of ultimate strength furthermore the positive or negative effect of the lateral pressure was clarified especially an interesting phenomenon that the presence of lateral pressure would increase ultimate strength was paid much attention to some influential factors were put together to enunciate the reason for this phenomenon this paper takes the plate slenderness the column slenderness and the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure as three essential design variables adopt the conventional stiffened plates derived from the bottom plate of a bulk carrier as the research object to perform collapse analysis finally the validation of the proposed empirical formula and numerical models is performed by relevant experiments and other literature results 2 methodology 2 1 description of object stiffened plate stiffened panels surrounded by longitudinal girders and transverse frames were chosen as the target for the benchmark analysis issc 2012 the stiffened plate is selected as 1 2 1 1 2 span and 1 2 1 1 2 bay model because the two span and two bay model is more suitable for applying biaxial and lateral load yao et al 1997 as shown in fig 1 it is cautioned that the transverse frames were not modelled and replaced with constrained normal displacement conditions the plate slenderness of attached plate β range from 1 01 to 3 49 the column slenderness of stiffener λ range from 0 17 to 0 89 and the gyration radius of stiffener with attached plate r is calculated by eq 1 the material yield strength of plating and stiffeners is identical 313 6 mpa the section properties are calculated by eq 2 paik et al 2020 the detailed description of the stiffened plate is shown in table 1 six typical kinds of plate thickness and four typical kinds of stiffener are selected as the target model to describe the type of the stiffener conveniently t is chosen for representing t bar and a is chosen for representing angle bar besides t1 a1 represents the size of the stiffener is 138 90 9 12 mm t2 a2 represents the size of the stiffener is 235 90 10 15 mm t3 a3 represents the size of the stiffener is 383 100 12 17 mm t4 a4 represents the size of the stiffener is 580 150 15 20 it should be noted that during the regression analysis of the empirical formula take the average ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with the same slenderness as the regressive data so that weaken the effect of the type of stiffeners and care for the slenderness therefore the type of stiffener is selected as angle bar and tee bar however to illustrate the final empirical formulas that would also apply to predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened plate with flat bar the flat bar 200mm 20 8 mm was designed as an example the plate slenderness and the column slenderness of it are the same as t2 13p0 the load displacement curves of the two stiffened plates are shown in fig 2 the ultimate strength σ x u l t σ y difference of them is within 0 6 then we confirm the proposed simplified formula would be applicable to panels stiffened with flat bars 1 β b t p σ y e λ a π r σ y

material and geometric nonlinearities are considered in the fe model the ideal elastic plastic model and the riks method are adopted during the numerical analysis as is known to us all the mesh size plays an essential role in determining the calculation accuracy and efficiency then an appropriate mesh size is needed to capture the collapse behavior the mesh size of two span and two bay model was selected as 10 elements between two longitudinal stiffeners and 6 elements along the web by osaka university according to issc 2012 the element size of 80 mm 60 mm 50 mm 40 mm 30 mm 20 mm were respectively selected for mesh sensitivity analysis corresponding to the above mesh sizes the number of elements along the web is 3 4 5 6 8 12 the number of elements is 11 14 17 21 28 and 42 between adjacent stiffeners respectively the ultimate strength exhibits a stable state when the element sizes are below 40 mm as shown in fig 3 therefore an element size of 40 mm was used in the finite element model to ensure relatively accurate results and higher calculation efficiency 2 3 initial geometric imperfections the initial geometric imperfections of stiffened plates caused by manufacturing procedures play a critical factor in determining the ultimate strength ueda and yao 1985 cui and mansour 1998 which have been widely recognized hashemzadeh et al 2021 comparatively explored the effect of several factors on the residual stress and distortion involving materials thickness corrosion degradation and degree of corrosion which are beneficial to reducing repair costs by optimizing these factors the residual stress was not taken into account for considering two aspects first if stiffened plates are mainly bearing axial compressive loads the compressive residual stresses would decrease the strength but the tensile residual stresses would resist the compressive loads and vice versa for axial tensile loading paik and kim 2002 the decrease increase of load bearing capacity due to residual stresses produced by welding may in effect be offset by the effect of the change of the ultimate strength paik and kim 2002 besides the average reduction of residual stress on the strength is approximately 6 li et al 2021a b the detrimental effect of the structure composed of lower β and higher λ or lower β and higher λ is marginal li et al 2021a b therefore most fea studies on the ultimate strength pay attention to the ultimate strength caused by axial compression and the residual stress is not considered in the fea zhang and khan 2009 cui et al 2019 ma et al 2021 the x axis represents the direction parallel to the stiffener the y axis represents the direction perpendicular to the stiffener the z axis represents the out of plane direction three types of

the initial deflection magnitude is shown in table 2 2 4 boundary conditions and load application some studies on the fem modeling technique adopted to acquire the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened plates have been widely recognized in this study the boundary condition is consistent with issc 2012 the symmetric boundary condition is applicable for two span and two bay models because this kind of boundary condition would cause a smaller uncertainly for analyzing stiffened plates xu et al 2013 as shown in table 3 and fig 4 take the x axis as the longitudinal direction of the stiffener take the y axis as the direction of transverse frames and take the z axis as the direction perpendicular to the attached plate for the load case of combined longitudinal or transverse compression with lateral pressure two steps are adopted to arrange lateral pressure and axial compression given the ultimate strength has little matter with load sequence yao et al 1997 which could also facilitate the convergence of nonlinear calculations apply the lateral pressure on the surface without stiffeners compressive loads were applied in the form of displacement in the coupling point the coupling way was selected as equation that makes the displacement of the nodes consistent with reference points in a specific direction 3 result the following results are obtained by analyzing the target models of 48 kinds of structural dimensions the attached plate thickness of the target model is 9 5 mm 11 mm 13 mm 16 mm 22 mm and 33 mm respectively and the types of stiffeners are angle and t type whose dimensions are 138 90 9 12 mm stiffener 1 235 90 10 15 mm stiffener 2 383 100 12 17 mm stiffener 3 and 580 150 15 20 stiffener 4 respectively the column slenderness of the target model ranges from 0 17 to 0 89 and the plate slenderness of the target model ranges from 1 01 to 3 49 water pressure is an essential load component for the ship bottom structure in this study the lateral pressure was chosen as 0 mpa 0 05 mpa 0 1 mpa 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa 0 25 mpa and 0 3 mpa corresponds to the draft height between 0m and 30m xu et al 2018 to describe the dimensions of models conveniently take the form of stiffener plate lateral pressure to represent different structures and the magnitude of lateral pressure eight kinds of stiffeners are represented by t1 t2 t3 t4 a1 a2 a3 and a4 for example t1 9 5p0 1 represents the type of stiffener is t bar the dimension of the stiffener is 138 9 90 12 mm the thickness of the attached plate is 9 5 mm lateral pressure is 0 1 mpa 3 1 for the load cases of combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened plates composed of eight kinds of stiffeners and six kinds of attached plates is shown in fig 5 which is subjected to the combined lateral pressure and longitudinal compression the average reduction of ultimate strength caused by lateral pressure is recorded in table 4 the results show that the longitudinal load carrying capacity of different structural arrangements under the lateral pressure below 0 3 mpa is mainly concentrated between 0 10 σ y and 0 98 σ y the load displacement curves of stiffened plates bearing several amplitudes of lateral pressures are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 when β is set as constant the ultimate strength would decrease sharply for the stiffened plate with smaller dimensions of stiffener for example when the dimension of the stiffener is 138 90 9 12 mm and the thickness of the attached plate is 9 5 mm 13mm i e the plate slenderness is 3 49 3 02 2 55 the ultimate strength would decrease with the increase of lateral pressure no matter what type of the stiffener is however some interesting phenomena would appear when the thickness of the attached plate is between 16 mm and 33 mm there would usually be a peak value on the curves of the longitudinal ultimate strength changing under different lateral pressure as shown in fig 8 the interesting behavior could be explained by the following two points first the ultimate strength would increase when the effect of lateral pressure would increase the stiffness of the stiffened plate as shown in fig 8 the ultimate strength of the load case contains lateral pressure would increase e g the ultimate strength t1 33p0 1 is larger than that of t1 33p0 to highlight the key factor only one example are selected to explain this behavior the stiffness of the stiffened plate would increase when the lateral pressure presents therefore the ultimate strength increases simultaneously as shown in fig 7 the tensile stress would produce when the lateral pressure is applied on the surface of the stiffened plate which would contribute to resistance to the compressive loads paik and kim 2002 then the ultimate strength would increase for such load cases second load carrying capacity would increase when the effect of lateral pressure only changes the amplitude of the buckling and does not change the buckling pattern i e the effect of lateral pressure is consistent fig 10 b hugh and paik 2010 as shown in fig 9 g and h the collapse mode of t1 33p0 and t1 33p0 1 is consistent the presence of lateral pressure only changes the deformation amplitude at the ultimate state therefore when the lateral loads act the role of inhibiting the deformation but it would not change the deformation trend the ultimate strength would increase ma et al 2021 it should be noted that the peak ultimate strength appears in the different lateral pressure for different structure arrangements when the thickness of the attached plate is 16 mm the maximum ultimate strength appears at the lateral pressure of 0 05 mpa a similar phenomenon would appear in the lateral pressure of 0 1 mpa when the thickness of the attached plate is 22 mm however a peak of ultimate strength would appear in the lateral pressure of 0 15 mpa when the thickness of the attached plate is 33 mm that is to say with the increase of the attached plate thickness the ultimate strength reaches the maximum value at a higher lateral pressure however this is not a coincidence a similar phenomenon would appear in another two kinds of stiffeners with the size of the stiffener increasing the peak value would nearly fade away in the curves of ultimate strength varying with lateral pressure this shows that the lower column slenderness this phenomenon was more inhibited the reason for this is that the column buckling strength is related to the column slenderness then the pre buckling strength of the stiffened plate with stronger stiffeners is not affected by the lateral pressure easily according to the above two descriptions of the abnormal phenomenon the main parameters related to this phenomenon are the plate slenderness and the column slenderness as for the collapse mode of those stiffened plates whose ultimate strength would increase with lateral pressure increasing the common features are that the middle span and the sides of the stiffened plate would deform in the opposite direction to the lateral pressure as shown in fig 9 all of them could represent the characteristics of this collapse mode what should be noted is that the main collapse modes are column beam buckling or overall buckling the reason for the increase of ultimate strength is that lateral pressure is not enough to change the deformation direction of those parts but it would prevent this deformation trend besides the appearance of the lateral pressure changes the amplitude of the initial deflection to a certain extent as shown in fig 10 b the reason is that the effect of the lateral pressure is equivalent to stiffening structure against buckling hughes and paik 2010 in other words the presence of lateral pressure may be consistent with stiffening the plate against buckling also the collapse mode is similar to fig 10 c when the lateral pressure reaches 0 3 mpa or sufficient large lateral pressure as for the collapse of a stiffened plate whose ultimate strength would usually decrease with the lateral pressure increasing some phenomena were observed that the decrease of the ultimate strength is generally accompanied by a loss in the linear stage of the load displacement curves as shown in fig 6 furthermore by observing the stress distribution change of the load case without lateral pressure the longitudinal stiffeners of center span would fully yield first then with the increase of the axial load the deflection of beam column buckling would increase the deflection directions of center and side stiffeners are different because of the opposite initial deflection however by observing the stress distribution of the load cases with lateral pressure the initial yield area is located at the junction of longitudinal stiffeners and transverse frames then the increase of lateral pressure would always decrease the ultimate strength because the lateral pressure would promote the yielding of the area which is located at the junction of stiffeners and frames in summary the ultimate strength would decrease by changing the pre buckling strength and the lateral pressure promotes the buckling of the structure however the increase of the ultimate strength is caused by improving the pre buckling strength this is because the lateral pressure changes the magnitude of initial deflection and restrain the deflection opposite to the direction of lateral pressure but does not change the original deflection direction even though the nonlinear finite element method is powerful it requires a relatively long time to calculate and data processing consequently the valuable and straightforward empirical formula that can give a reasonable prediction for the ultimate strength of stiffened plates would be highly desirable in the practical structure design before empirical formulas are presented some preparation should be finished first clarify the design variables in the empirical by analyzing the influential factors and failure modes then construct an appropriate form of expression which could contain some primary failure mechanism finally finalize a formula with the numerical nonlinear fea results there are various empirical formulas for predicting the longitudinal ultimate strength some are only related to plate slenderness faulkner 1975 moreover there are two influencing factors in other empirical formulas including the plate slenderness and the column slenderness which fully consider the influence of lateral pressure on the ultimate strength lateral pressure has a non negligible effect on the ultimate strength tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 ma et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to present an empirical formula that involves the influence of lateral pressure to predict the ultimate strength well the ultimate strength is usually considered in a non dimensional form which could give a common ultimate strength prediction and a reference in the design of scaled models subjected to combined load zhang and khan 2009 presented an empirical formula for calculating the axial compression ultimate strength of stiffened plate as shown in eq 7 7 σ u σ y 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 f o r λ 2 paik and thayamballi 1997 proposed the empirical formula for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened panel based on the general format presented by lin 1985 as shown in eq 8 8 σ u σ y 1 0 995 0 936 λ 2 0 170 β 2 0 188 λ 2 β 2 0 067 λ 4 1 λ 2 based on the above formula xu et al 2018 propose the higher order interaction of β and λ as shown in eq 9 9 σ u σ y 1 c 0 c 1 λ c 2 β c 3 λ β c 4 λ 2 c 5 β 2 c 6 λ 2 β 2 c 7 λ 3 c 8 β 3 c 9 λ 3 β 3 c 10 λ 4 1 λ 2 although this formula contains the influence of lateral pressure this effect is embodied in the polynomial form of water pressure height to express it in a general form the dimensionless parameter of lateral pressure should be considered in the formula which could also be an alternative method to guide the design of scale models in this paper the empirical formula not only contains the plate slenderness and the column slenderness as described above but also contains the non dimensional parameters of lateral pressure the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure is obtained by eq 10 dier and dowling 1980 suppose the plate slenderness the column slenderness and the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure of the prototype are defined in that case we could derive the dimensions of the scaled model and the amplitude of lateral pressure acting on the scaled model take an example to clarify the advantage during the design of a scaled model owning the same ultimate strength as the prototype the plate slenderness and the column slenderness of the prototype are 2 00 and 0 31 respectively the draft height is 12m which induces the lateral pressure with the amplitude of 0 122 mpa dimensionless value q l 0 255 the ultimate strength of this stiffened plate subjected to combined longitudinal and lateral pressure could be obtained by xu et al 2018 and the formula presented in this paper although we could conveniently maintain the slenderness of scaled model unchanged by changing the dimension of the scaled model according to the scale factor the lateral pressure acting on the scaled model could not be easily obtained by xu et al 2018 when the yield strength of the scaled model is different from that of the prototype however the values of lateral pressure acting on the scaled model could be obtained easily by keeping q l unchanged the detailed message is shown in table 5 and the corresponding load displacement curves are shown in fig 11 by maintaining the ql firmed we could obtain consistent results of σ x u l t then we could obtain the lateral pressure acting on the s t l is 0 068 mpa the lateral pressure acting on the s t h is 0 188 mpa therefore this method is easy to guide the design of lateral pressure acting on the scaled model however these values may not be easily obtained by xu et al 2018 from this point of view this kind of expression is more general without a dimensional message besides it could be chosen as a design method of the scaled model subjected to combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure 10 q l q 0 e σ y 2 first the empirical formula form is determined according to the above formula and the coefficients are acquired based on the nonlinear fea results without the effect of lateral pressure then the influence of lateral pressure was further considered as a revision for the formula although there is less description on the form of correction of lateral pressure on the ultimate strength it is considered in the form of exponential function for the reason of nonlinear effect and this function could keep the value of revision coefficient as one when lateral pressure is 0 mpa in this paper the expression of lateral pressure correction on the ultimate strength is dimensionless which is more general than that proposed by xu et al 2018 as shown in eq 11 based on the 336 nonlinear fea results of the load cases without lateral pressure the coefficients are shown in table 6 it should be noted that the average value of the ultimate strength of different kinds of stiffener with the same slenderness was used to predict the regression coefficient σ u σ y 1 c 0 q l c 1 q l β c 2 q l λ c 3 q l λ β c 4 q l β 2 c 5 q l λ 2 c 6 q l λ 2 β 2 c 7 q l β 3 c 8 q l λ 3 c 9 q l λ 3 β 3 c 10 q l λ 4 11 1 λ 2 3 2 for the load cases of combined transverse compression and lateral pressure transverse ultimate strength is mainly connected with the plate slenderness and the aspect ratio the difference of the transverse ultimate strength of the stiffened plates with different kinds of stiffeners was first compared take the load displacement curves of t1 t2 t3 t4 a1 a2 a3 a4 16p0 for an example to clarify the difference as shown in fig 12 the maximum difference of the transverse ultimate strength of stiffened plates with the same dimensions and unique types of stiffeners is below 3 3 the maximum difference of transverse ultimate strength of stiffened plate with every kind of stiffener is below 5 9 it could conclude that the type of stiffener has a minor effect on the transverse ultimate strength so that only one kind of stiffener t2 was selected to discuss the ultimate strength varying with the thickness of the attached plate and the amplitude of the lateral pressure for the load case of combined transverse compression and lateral loads the transverse ultimate strength of stiffened plate with different thicknesses of attached plate under the different lateral pressure is shown in fig 13 the impact of lateral pressure on the transverse ultimate strength is nonlinear when β is constant for the thinner attached plate the effect of lateral pressure is significant by contrast the influence of the same amplitude of lateral pressure on the transverse ultimate strength weakens gradually for the thicker attached plate take the collapse modes of t2 9 5 and t2 33 as an example to explain this phenomenon as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 the collapse mode is induced by the failure of the attached plate when the thickness of attached plate is 9 5 mm at this time the collapse mode would change as long as the lateral pressure exists however the collapse mode is overall symmetrical when the thickness of the attached plate is 33 mm which is similar to that induced by the initial deflection of the column type it should be noted that the collapse modes would not change despite the presence of lateral pressure then the transverse ultimate strength is not sensitive to lateral pressure it generally decreases with the increase of the lateral pressure for the transverse ultimate strength however a similar abnormal phenomenon to the load cases of combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure appears when the lateral pressure reaches some values that is to say the lateral pressure has two adverse effects on the failure behaviors including the increase of pre buckling strength and acceleration of yielding fujikubo et al 2005b however the influence of lateral pressure on the transverse ultimate strength could not be the same as that on the longitudinal ultimate strength for considering two aspects on the one hand the interesting behavior is not evident as that occurred in the load cases of combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure for example for the reason of the presence of lateral pressure the longitudinal ultimate strength of t2 33p0 1 would increase 3 10 by contrast the transverse ultimate strength of t2 33p 1 would increase 1 98 on the other hand the interesting behavior would not always occur at the same time for the two kinds of combined loads cases for example because of the presence of lateral pressure the longitudinal ultimate strength of t2 33p0 3 would decrease 2 32 by contrast the transverse ultimate strength of t2 33p0 3 would increase 1 65 a simple and useful formula that could predict the ultimate strength of stiffened plates reasonably would be highly desirable for practical engineering design as for the empirical formula for the transverse compressive strength there are several forms valsgard 1980 proposed a transverse ultimate strength empirical formula that is more applicable for stocky plates and slender plates than that obtained by faulkner et al 1973 as shown in eq 12 12 σ u σ y σ x u α 0 08 1 1 β 2 2 1 1 α f o r α 1 where σ x u is the axial ultimate load carrying capacity of a simply supported plate and α is the aspect ratio paik et al 2004 proposed the ultimate capacity design formula which is connected with the plate slenderness and the aspect ratio as shown in eq 13 and eq 14 13 σ y u σ y 1 α σ x u σ y 0 475 β 2 1 1 α f o r α 1 14 σ x u 0 032 β 4 0 002 β 2 1 f o r β 1 5 1 274 β f o r 1 5 β 3 0 1 248 β 2 0 283 f o r β 3 0 where σ x u is the longitudinal ultimate load carrying capacity and α is the aspect ratio regarding the impact of lateral pressure on the evaluation of transverse strength some correction factors and empirical formulas were presented the transverse compressive buckling strength correction factors c p x has been proposed to consider the impact of lateral pressure by curve fitting based on the fem results fujikubo et al 1998 as shown in eq 15 15 c p x 1 1 160 b a 0 95 p b 4 e t 4 1 75 f o r a b 2 shi and gao 2020 proposed an empirical formula for calculating the transverse ultimate strength and take the effect of lateral pressure into account transverse ultimate strength is calculated by eq 16 and that under the combined loads is calculated by eq 17 16 σ u σ y 2 05 β 3 15 β 2 1 α 14 1 β 34 85 β 2 f o r λ 0 55 a n d α 10 0 1 0 β 0 45 β 2 1 α 0 15 β 1 25 β 2 f o r o t h e r s 17 σ u q σ u 1 0 03 q b s 2 σ y t p 2 0 09 q b s 2 σ y t p 2 2 f o r 0 1 q b s 2 σ y t p 2 2 0 it should be mentioned that both the aspect ratio the plate slenderness and the lateral pressure are the essential factors that would affect the transverse ultimate strength however the column slenderness is not the key factor in the transverse ultimate strength and the type of the stiffener is selected as 235 90 10 15 t to improve the applicability of the empirical formula for the load cases of combined transverse compression and lateral pressure enriched nonlinear fea that involves the influence of different aspect ratios were performed based on the survey of hatch cover drawings used in bulk carriers container ships and general cargo ships the aspect ratio ranges from 3 8 to 14 3 and the plate slenderness ranges from 1 1 to 3 8 can cover most cases in actual ship design shi and gao 2020 as shown in table 7 and table 8 it should be noted that some kinds of stiffened plates are not selected as the targets in table 8 for considering that the plate slenderness of them are not located between 1 1 and 3 8 for example when α is 5 and the plate thickness is 22 mm at this moment the plate slenderness is 0 90 which is not belongs to 1 1 and 3 8 and would not be chosen as the target the reduction of ultimate strength caused by lateral pressure is shown in table 9 the results indicate that the transverse ultimate capacity would reduce by 0 78 σ y at most when the lateral pressure up to 0 3 mpa for the stiffened plate with a thinner attached plate finally a new empirical formula is proposed based on the 147 fea results which involve the influence of the plate slenderness the aspect ratio and the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure as shown in eq 18 and eq 19 18 σ u σ y 2 846 β 5 180 β 2 f q l 1 1 1 α 4 921 β 7 414 β 2 f q l 2 f o r a b 3 19 f q l 1 e 0 280 q l 0 113 q l 2 f q l 2 e 0 723 q l 0 134 q l 2 4 validation 4 1 validation of the applicability of the proposed empirical formula the comparison of dimensionless ultimate strength between numerical analysis and regression formula is shown in fig 16 it could be discovered that the results obtained from the regression formula are in good agreement with fe results the accuracy of the regression model could be evaluated by the coefficient r 2 which is statistical data that gives the measurement of the correlation between the provided results and the assessment of the results calculated by regression function xu et al 2018 and is given by eq 20 and eq 21 20 r 2 s s r s s t w i t h 0 r 2 1 21 s s t i 1 n y i y 2 s s r i 1 n y i ˆ y 2 s s e i 1 n y i y i ˆ 2 where the total sum of squares s s t and regression sum of squares s s r and error sum s s e are calculated by eq 21 y i and y i ˆ are the load bearing capacity of stiffened panels predicted for each sample point in the numerical model and regression analysis y is the mean value the corresponding coefficients between the fem results and predicted results is r x 2 0 98 and r y 2 0 93 respectively these statistical data reveals that from the perspective of design and hull reliability analysis the statistical model could give reasonable predictions furthermore the accuracy of the proposed empirical formula based on non linear fe analysis could be verified by stiffened plates collapse tests the collapse tests of stiffened plates bearing combined loads have been conducted by ma et al 2021 the description of the stiffened plate used in the experiment as follows the plate length a is 600 mm the plate breadth b is 160 mm and the amplitude of the lateral pressure is 0 0061 mpa the plate slenderness is 1 801 that is calculated by eq 1 the column slenderness is 0 679 that is also calculated by eq 1 the non dimension parameter of lateral pressure is 0 227 that is calculated by eq 10 the experimental results are compared with the results obtained by the presented empirical formula as shown in fig 17 the results predicted by the derived formula are conservative are slightly lower than that obtained in the experiment the difference between the test and formula is 4 46 which demonstrates good consistency and the reason for this is that the experiment was performed with assisting equipment which would supply extra stiffness to the structure the comparison of ultimate strength calculated by nonlinear fea and some empirical formula is shown in fig 18 and fig 19 it could be seen that the results obtained by the presented formula are usually located between the results obtained by other empirical formulas whatever the load case is combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure or combined transverse compression and lateral pressure there are several reasons that could be responsible for this phenomenon first the amplitude of initial deflection is not fixed and is adopted by experience which would work as a critical role in influencing the ultimate strength also the results of fem on behalf of the average ultimate strength of the model section and the results could be influenced by the boundary which is also a reason for this phenomenon 4 2 validation of the accuracy of the numerical models the stress strain curve of stiffened plate recorded in issc 2012 is selected as the reference to verify the effectiveness of the modeling method as shown in fig 20 the stress strain curve obtained by fea show the good consistency with that recorded in issc 2012 which proves the accuracy of modeling method furthermore the ultimate strength value corresponding to the fe model could be obtained by issc 2012 which could also confirm the accuracy of the fe modelling technique in this paper we enrich the transverse ultimate strength data by considering different aspect ratio and it should be noted that the enriched models with the same kind of stiffener t2 because the column slenderness is not the key fact in transverse ultimate strength so the transverse ultimate strength comparison is only selected the models with one kind of stiffener as shown in fig 21 5 conclusion a series of numerical simulations of stiffened plates subjected to combined loads are carried out to explore the effect of lateral pressure on the ultimate strength to improve the accuracy of ultimate strength assessment and reveal the interaction of combined loads empirical formula under the corresponding load conditions are proposed based several non dimensional parameters the presented formula could be in good agreement with the numerical results and corresponding experiments for the combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure in view of the analysis of this research the following conclusions could be drawn 1 the appearance of lateral pressure would increase the longitudinal ultimate strength when the column slenderness is larger than 0 7 and the collapse mode is periodic symmetrical there are several reasons for this first the collapse mode of the central span behave opposite to the lateral pressure and the lateral pressure that is not enough to change the deformation trend would inhibit this deformation second the lateral pressure would change the amplitude of initial deflection of the attached plate to a certain degree and the ultimate strength would increase when the collapse mode is induced by the plate the last but not least the lateral pressure would affect the pre buckling strength that is to say the ultimate strength would increase when the pre buckling strength increase 2 considering the same stiffened plate under the same lateral pressure collapsed by longitudinal loads or transverse loads the lateral pressure effect on the longitudinal ultimate strength is unique from the transverse ultimate strength of stiffened plates for considering two aspects on the one hand the interesting behavior does not usually occur simultaneously on the other hand although the interesting behavior occurs simultaneously for two load cases this interesting behavior is more evident in collapse caused by longitudinal loads 3 the proposed empirical formula based on richer samples could be employed to improve the accuracy of ultimate strength under several combined load conditions in addition the non dimension parameter of lateral pressure is defined as follow 22 q l q 0 e σ y 2 the influence of lateral pressure is reflected in the correction of coefficient which could keep as 1 when the lateral pressure is 0 mpa as follow 23 c q l a e b q l d q l 2 where a b and d is constant 4 the lateral pressure has a significant effect on both longitudinal and transverse ultimate strength which would nearly decrease 90 when the lateral pressure reaches 0 3 mpa draft 30m the attached plate thicker the transverse ultimate strength would reduce less under the same lateral pressure besides although the column slenderness is not the key factor that would affect the transverse ultimate strength the negative effect of the lateral pressure on the ultimate strength would also reduce for the stiffened plate with a larger stiffener credit authorship contribution statement hongyang ma formal analysis data curation

20192,as the basic unit of the ship bottom plate the stiffened plate is usually subjected to multiple loads although the compressive loads may be responsible for the ultimate state of the hull structure lateral pressure is also an essential component of loads for the bottom plate in this paper the collapse modes and ultimate strength of stiffened plates under the symmetric end condition subjected to combined axial compression and lateral loads are investigated to analyze the effect of lateral pressure results revealed that the lateral pressure could affect the ultimate strength and collapse mode by changing the pre buckling strength and the magnitude of initial deflection correspondingly the empirical formulas that contain the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure for calculating the ultimate strength are proposed to intuitively quantify the influence of lateral pressure in addition corresponding results obtained by experiments are compared with those obtained by empirical formulas and the validity of the empirical formulas was further verified keywords stiffened plate lateral pressure collapse mode ultimate strength empirical formula 1 introduction the stiffened plate is the basic unit of the ship bottom plate which is usually subjected to loads from multiple directions aiming at guaranteeing the safety of ships under severe sea conditions the ultimate states of stiffened plates need to be evaluated although the longitudinal compressive stresses may be the primary load component that would cause the collapse of the ship plate in the hogging condition the effect of lateral pressure is also considerable during the collapse process of the ship bottom plate recently the negative impact of lateral pressure on the ultimate strength has been focused on some literature tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 ma et al 2021 however the ultimate strength would also increase when the lateral pressure reaches some values in addition the collapse modes could be classified when the interesting behavior appears and then it will be convenient to identify the effect of lateral pressure on the failure mode in a word when the effect of lateral pressure inhibits or promotes the collapse process of the stiffened plate the failure modes are worth exploring during the past few years the collapse mechanism of the panels and stiffened plates has been explored in detail some empirical formulas were put forward about the panels and stiffened plates to obtain the ultimate strength effectively yang et al 2018 presented a piecewise empirical formula to evaluate the dynamic ultimate strength of rectangular plates bear axial compression with different loading speeds liu and zhang 2020 analyze the effect of rotational stiffness the aspect ratio and initial deflection on the ultimate strength of ship plates bear axial compressions then they proposed a modified empirical formula which contains the above factors hayward and lehmann 2017 presented a new formula of the load bearing capacity of plates under the biaxial loads which could capture the influences of the plate slenderness and aspect ratio kim et al 2018 reviewed the well known formula predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened plates by comparing it with analytical and fea results finally proposed the ultimate strength without considering the fluctuation behavior could be predicted by the empirical formula li et al 2021a b present an adapted algorithm to predict the stiffened plates collapse progress which extends the predicting capacity including elastic stiffness ultimate and post ultimate features the ultimate strength of stiffened plate subjected to the combined longitudinal compressive stress and lateral pressure has been studied in some literature including the corresponding numerical analysis empirical formulas and experiments yao et al 1997 explored the effect of the boundary conditions on the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under the combined action of longitudinal and lateral loads in addition a crucial conclusion was given that the ultimate strength of stiffened panels bear combined loads has few connections with the loading sequence therefore applying the lateral pressure first and keep as a constant in the second step then the axial load was applied in the second step zhang 2016 performed a comprehensive review on the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates bear axial compressions then a semi empirical equation that includes the plate slenderness and the column slenderness was presented and validated by many numerical and experimental results kim et al 2017 proposed the empirical formula for predicting the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate 2 span and 2 bay with the symmetric conditions under the longitudinal compression by considering the plate slenderness and the column slenderness xu et al 2017 explored the influence of lateral pressure on the ultimate strength they proposed that the load carrying capacity would decrease with lateral pressure increasing for the failure induced by the plate moreover a higher ultimate strength would be obtained by applying lateral pressure in the middle span to prevent the middle span from buckling furthermore some empirical formulas on the ultimate strength were proposed khedmati et al 2017 presented the empirical formula to assess the transverse ultimate strength of aluminum stiffened plates based on additional consideration of lateral loads xu et al 2018 studied the influence of the type of stiffener and the lateral pressure on the ultimate strength although the column slenderness of angle bar t bar and flat bar is identical the flexural rigidity and torsional rigidity of angle and t bar stiffener are larger which leads to a higher ultimate strength besides the empirical formulas for calculating the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under the combined loads were proposed which took into account the higher order interaction of column slenderness and plate slenderness it should be noted that the empirical formula expression could be improved in a non dimensional form the non dimensional empirical formulas could not only obtain the ultimate strength but also these formulas could give reference to the design of the scaled model subjected to multiple loads jiang and zhang 2014 2015 analyzed the impact of lateral loads on the ultimate strength they proposed that the water head of 30m would reduce the ultimate strength of stiffened plates whose thickness of the attached plate is 18 5 mm with symmetric boundary conditions under axial compression by 20 therefore lateral pressure is a crucial factor in the structure design besides the load case of layout lateral pressure at the plate would lead to local serve deformation at the intersection of the transverse frame and stiffener in contrast the lateral pressure applied at the side with stiffeners would increase the deformation of the middle span although longitudinal compressive stresses act as a leading part in the collapse process of ship plates the influence of transverse compressive stresses should not be ignored mol comfort collapsed in the hogging condition according to the investigation report on structural safety of large container ship 2014 one possible reason for this is the considerable transverse compressive stresses appearing at ship bottom plates besides tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 indicated the lateral pressure act in the ship bottom plate would also induce transverse compressive stresses the ultimate load bearing capacity is affected by transverse compressive stresses the ultimate strength of combined transverse compressive stresses and lateral pressure has also been studied fujikubo et al 2005a 2005b studied the ultimate strength of plates or stiffened panels under the combined transverse and lateral loads the relevant ultimate strength evaluation formulas were proposed respectively besides an interesting phenomenon is that the transverse ultimate strength does not usually decrease with lateral pressure increasing the main reason for this is that membrane action and material strain hardening effect guedes soares and gordo 1996 presented the ultimate strength regression equation of the stiffened panel under biaxial compression and extended the equation to the load case involving the lateral loads dier and dowling 1980 derived the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure then the influential factors including the non dimensional parameter of the lateral pressure and plate slenderness were fully considered in the formula paik and seo 2009a 2009b explore the ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates under the combined biaxial and lateral loads with non linear fea the results are compared with those obtained by the alps ulsap semi analytical method to study the influence of structural dimensions initial defections and other factors on the ultimate strength moreover the degree of rotational constraints would be more considerable when the lateral pressure is applied the lateral pressure could also reduce the sensitivity of ultimate strength to the amplitude of initial deflection naruse and kawamura 2017 studied the collapse behavior of the stiffened plate subjected to biaxial compression and proposed that the larger transverse load would change the buckling mode to a single half wave which would reduce the effective length of the panel then the corresponding regression formula to predict the ultimate strength of stiffened plate subjected to biaxial compression was proposed a parameter representing the reduction of effective width a parameter representing the lateral torsional buckling of stiffeners and a parameter representing the beginning to reduce the effective width is introduced in the regression formula shi and gao 2020 studied the transverse ultimate strength of the u type stiffened plate with a symmetric boundary condition by considering the effect of the aspect ratio and plate slenderness finally the empirical formula for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under the transverse compression or combined transverse compression and lateral pressure was presented this research investigated the effect of lateral pressure on the collapse process and ultimate strength of stiffened plates with different slenderness under several combined load conditions aim to numerically evaluate the effect of lateral pressure and propose corresponding modified empirical formulas which contain the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure then the empirical formula could be regarded as an alternative assessment method of ultimate strength furthermore the positive or negative effect of the lateral pressure was clarified especially an interesting phenomenon that the presence of lateral pressure would increase ultimate strength was paid much attention to some influential factors were put together to enunciate the reason for this phenomenon this paper takes the plate slenderness the column slenderness and the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure as three essential design variables adopt the conventional stiffened plates derived from the bottom plate of a bulk carrier as the research object to perform collapse analysis finally the validation of the proposed empirical formula and numerical models is performed by relevant experiments and other literature results 2 methodology 2 1 description of object stiffened plate stiffened panels surrounded by longitudinal girders and transverse frames were chosen as the target for the benchmark analysis issc 2012 the stiffened plate is selected as 1 2 1 1 2 span and 1 2 1 1 2 bay model because the two span and two bay model is more suitable for applying biaxial and lateral load yao et al 1997 as shown in fig 1 it is cautioned that the transverse frames were not modelled and replaced with constrained normal displacement conditions the plate slenderness of attached plate β range from 1 01 to 3 49 the column slenderness of stiffener λ range from 0 17 to 0 89 and the gyration radius of stiffener with attached plate r is calculated by eq 1 the material yield strength of plating and stiffeners is identical 313 6 mpa the section properties are calculated by eq 2 paik et al 2020 the detailed description of the stiffened plate is shown in table 1 six typical kinds of plate thickness and four typical kinds of stiffener are selected as the target model to describe the type of the stiffener conveniently t is chosen for representing t bar and a is chosen for representing angle bar besides t1 a1 represents the size of the stiffener is 138 90 9 12 mm t2 a2 represents the size of the stiffener is 235 90 10 15 mm t3 a3 represents the size of the stiffener is 383 100 12 17 mm t4 a4 represents the size of the stiffener is 580 150 15 20 it should be noted that during the regression analysis of the empirical formula take the average ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with the same slenderness as the regressive data so that weaken the effect of the type of stiffeners and care for the slenderness therefore the type of stiffener is selected as angle bar and tee bar however to illustrate the final empirical formulas that would also apply to predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened plate with flat bar the flat bar 200mm 20 8 mm was designed as an example the plate slenderness and the column slenderness of it are the same as t2 13p0 the load displacement curves of the two stiffened plates are shown in fig 2 the ultimate strength σ x u l t σ y difference of them is within 0 6 then we confirm the proposed simplified formula would be applicable to panels stiffened with flat bars 1 β b t p σ y e λ a π r σ y

material and geometric nonlinearities are considered in the fe model the ideal elastic plastic model and the riks method are adopted during the numerical analysis as is known to us all the mesh size plays an essential role in determining the calculation accuracy and efficiency then an appropriate mesh size is needed to capture the collapse behavior the mesh size of two span and two bay model was selected as 10 elements between two longitudinal stiffeners and 6 elements along the web by osaka university according to issc 2012 the element size of 80 mm 60 mm 50 mm 40 mm 30 mm 20 mm were respectively selected for mesh sensitivity analysis corresponding to the above mesh sizes the number of elements along the web is 3 4 5 6 8 12 the number of elements is 11 14 17 21 28 and 42 between adjacent stiffeners respectively the ultimate strength exhibits a stable state when the element sizes are below 40 mm as shown in fig 3 therefore an element size of 40 mm was used in the finite element model to ensure relatively accurate results and higher calculation efficiency 2 3 initial geometric imperfections the initial geometric imperfections of stiffened plates caused by manufacturing procedures play a critical factor in determining the ultimate strength ueda and yao 1985 cui and mansour 1998 which have been widely recognized hashemzadeh et al 2021 comparatively explored the effect of several factors on the residual stress and distortion involving materials thickness corrosion degradation and degree of corrosion which are beneficial to reducing repair costs by optimizing these factors the residual stress was not taken into account for considering two aspects first if stiffened plates are mainly bearing axial compressive loads the compressive residual stresses would decrease the strength but the tensile residual stresses would resist the compressive loads and vice versa for axial tensile loading paik and kim 2002 the decrease increase of load bearing capacity due to residual stresses produced by welding may in effect be offset by the effect of the change of the ultimate strength paik and kim 2002 besides the average reduction of residual stress on the strength is approximately 6 li et al 2021a b the detrimental effect of the structure composed of lower β and higher λ or lower β and higher λ is marginal li et al 2021a b therefore most fea studies on the ultimate strength pay attention to the ultimate strength caused by axial compression and the residual stress is not considered in the fea zhang and khan 2009 cui et al 2019 ma et al 2021 the x axis represents the direction parallel to the stiffener the y axis represents the direction perpendicular to the stiffener the z axis represents the out of plane direction three types of

the initial deflection magnitude is shown in table 2 2 4 boundary conditions and load application some studies on the fem modeling technique adopted to acquire the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened plates have been widely recognized in this study the boundary condition is consistent with issc 2012 the symmetric boundary condition is applicable for two span and two bay models because this kind of boundary condition would cause a smaller uncertainly for analyzing stiffened plates xu et al 2013 as shown in table 3 and fig 4 take the x axis as the longitudinal direction of the stiffener take the y axis as the direction of transverse frames and take the z axis as the direction perpendicular to the attached plate for the load case of combined longitudinal or transverse compression with lateral pressure two steps are adopted to arrange lateral pressure and axial compression given the ultimate strength has little matter with load sequence yao et al 1997 which could also facilitate the convergence of nonlinear calculations apply the lateral pressure on the surface without stiffeners compressive loads were applied in the form of displacement in the coupling point the coupling way was selected as equation that makes the displacement of the nodes consistent with reference points in a specific direction 3 result the following results are obtained by analyzing the target models of 48 kinds of structural dimensions the attached plate thickness of the target model is 9 5 mm 11 mm 13 mm 16 mm 22 mm and 33 mm respectively and the types of stiffeners are angle and t type whose dimensions are 138 90 9 12 mm stiffener 1 235 90 10 15 mm stiffener 2 383 100 12 17 mm stiffener 3 and 580 150 15 20 stiffener 4 respectively the column slenderness of the target model ranges from 0 17 to 0 89 and the plate slenderness of the target model ranges from 1 01 to 3 49 water pressure is an essential load component for the ship bottom structure in this study the lateral pressure was chosen as 0 mpa 0 05 mpa 0 1 mpa 0 15 mpa 0 2 mpa 0 25 mpa and 0 3 mpa corresponds to the draft height between 0m and 30m xu et al 2018 to describe the dimensions of models conveniently take the form of stiffener plate lateral pressure to represent different structures and the magnitude of lateral pressure eight kinds of stiffeners are represented by t1 t2 t3 t4 a1 a2 a3 and a4 for example t1 9 5p0 1 represents the type of stiffener is t bar the dimension of the stiffener is 138 9 90 12 mm the thickness of the attached plate is 9 5 mm lateral pressure is 0 1 mpa 3 1 for the load cases of combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure the ultimate load carrying capacity of the stiffened plates composed of eight kinds of stiffeners and six kinds of attached plates is shown in fig 5 which is subjected to the combined lateral pressure and longitudinal compression the average reduction of ultimate strength caused by lateral pressure is recorded in table 4 the results show that the longitudinal load carrying capacity of different structural arrangements under the lateral pressure below 0 3 mpa is mainly concentrated between 0 10 σ y and 0 98 σ y the load displacement curves of stiffened plates bearing several amplitudes of lateral pressures are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 when β is set as constant the ultimate strength would decrease sharply for the stiffened plate with smaller dimensions of stiffener for example when the dimension of the stiffener is 138 90 9 12 mm and the thickness of the attached plate is 9 5 mm 13mm i e the plate slenderness is 3 49 3 02 2 55 the ultimate strength would decrease with the increase of lateral pressure no matter what type of the stiffener is however some interesting phenomena would appear when the thickness of the attached plate is between 16 mm and 33 mm there would usually be a peak value on the curves of the longitudinal ultimate strength changing under different lateral pressure as shown in fig 8 the interesting behavior could be explained by the following two points first the ultimate strength would increase when the effect of lateral pressure would increase the stiffness of the stiffened plate as shown in fig 8 the ultimate strength of the load case contains lateral pressure would increase e g the ultimate strength t1 33p0 1 is larger than that of t1 33p0 to highlight the key factor only one example are selected to explain this behavior the stiffness of the stiffened plate would increase when the lateral pressure presents therefore the ultimate strength increases simultaneously as shown in fig 7 the tensile stress would produce when the lateral pressure is applied on the surface of the stiffened plate which would contribute to resistance to the compressive loads paik and kim 2002 then the ultimate strength would increase for such load cases second load carrying capacity would increase when the effect of lateral pressure only changes the amplitude of the buckling and does not change the buckling pattern i e the effect of lateral pressure is consistent fig 10 b hugh and paik 2010 as shown in fig 9 g and h the collapse mode of t1 33p0 and t1 33p0 1 is consistent the presence of lateral pressure only changes the deformation amplitude at the ultimate state therefore when the lateral loads act the role of inhibiting the deformation but it would not change the deformation trend the ultimate strength would increase ma et al 2021 it should be noted that the peak ultimate strength appears in the different lateral pressure for different structure arrangements when the thickness of the attached plate is 16 mm the maximum ultimate strength appears at the lateral pressure of 0 05 mpa a similar phenomenon would appear in the lateral pressure of 0 1 mpa when the thickness of the attached plate is 22 mm however a peak of ultimate strength would appear in the lateral pressure of 0 15 mpa when the thickness of the attached plate is 33 mm that is to say with the increase of the attached plate thickness the ultimate strength reaches the maximum value at a higher lateral pressure however this is not a coincidence a similar phenomenon would appear in another two kinds of stiffeners with the size of the stiffener increasing the peak value would nearly fade away in the curves of ultimate strength varying with lateral pressure this shows that the lower column slenderness this phenomenon was more inhibited the reason for this is that the column buckling strength is related to the column slenderness then the pre buckling strength of the stiffened plate with stronger stiffeners is not affected by the lateral pressure easily according to the above two descriptions of the abnormal phenomenon the main parameters related to this phenomenon are the plate slenderness and the column slenderness as for the collapse mode of those stiffened plates whose ultimate strength would increase with lateral pressure increasing the common features are that the middle span and the sides of the stiffened plate would deform in the opposite direction to the lateral pressure as shown in fig 9 all of them could represent the characteristics of this collapse mode what should be noted is that the main collapse modes are column beam buckling or overall buckling the reason for the increase of ultimate strength is that lateral pressure is not enough to change the deformation direction of those parts but it would prevent this deformation trend besides the appearance of the lateral pressure changes the amplitude of the initial deflection to a certain extent as shown in fig 10 b the reason is that the effect of the lateral pressure is equivalent to stiffening structure against buckling hughes and paik 2010 in other words the presence of lateral pressure may be consistent with stiffening the plate against buckling also the collapse mode is similar to fig 10 c when the lateral pressure reaches 0 3 mpa or sufficient large lateral pressure as for the collapse of a stiffened plate whose ultimate strength would usually decrease with the lateral pressure increasing some phenomena were observed that the decrease of the ultimate strength is generally accompanied by a loss in the linear stage of the load displacement curves as shown in fig 6 furthermore by observing the stress distribution change of the load case without lateral pressure the longitudinal stiffeners of center span would fully yield first then with the increase of the axial load the deflection of beam column buckling would increase the deflection directions of center and side stiffeners are different because of the opposite initial deflection however by observing the stress distribution of the load cases with lateral pressure the initial yield area is located at the junction of longitudinal stiffeners and transverse frames then the increase of lateral pressure would always decrease the ultimate strength because the lateral pressure would promote the yielding of the area which is located at the junction of stiffeners and frames in summary the ultimate strength would decrease by changing the pre buckling strength and the lateral pressure promotes the buckling of the structure however the increase of the ultimate strength is caused by improving the pre buckling strength this is because the lateral pressure changes the magnitude of initial deflection and restrain the deflection opposite to the direction of lateral pressure but does not change the original deflection direction even though the nonlinear finite element method is powerful it requires a relatively long time to calculate and data processing consequently the valuable and straightforward empirical formula that can give a reasonable prediction for the ultimate strength of stiffened plates would be highly desirable in the practical structure design before empirical formulas are presented some preparation should be finished first clarify the design variables in the empirical by analyzing the influential factors and failure modes then construct an appropriate form of expression which could contain some primary failure mechanism finally finalize a formula with the numerical nonlinear fea results there are various empirical formulas for predicting the longitudinal ultimate strength some are only related to plate slenderness faulkner 1975 moreover there are two influencing factors in other empirical formulas including the plate slenderness and the column slenderness which fully consider the influence of lateral pressure on the ultimate strength lateral pressure has a non negligible effect on the ultimate strength tatsumi and fujikubo 2020 ma et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to present an empirical formula that involves the influence of lateral pressure to predict the ultimate strength well the ultimate strength is usually considered in a non dimensional form which could give a common ultimate strength prediction and a reference in the design of scaled models subjected to combined load zhang and khan 2009 presented an empirical formula for calculating the axial compression ultimate strength of stiffened plate as shown in eq 7 7 σ u σ y 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 f o r λ 2 paik and thayamballi 1997 proposed the empirical formula for predicting the ultimate strength of stiffened panel based on the general format presented by lin 1985 as shown in eq 8 8 σ u σ y 1 0 995 0 936 λ 2 0 170 β 2 0 188 λ 2 β 2 0 067 λ 4 1 λ 2 based on the above formula xu et al 2018 propose the higher order interaction of β and λ as shown in eq 9 9 σ u σ y 1 c 0 c 1 λ c 2 β c 3 λ β c 4 λ 2 c 5 β 2 c 6 λ 2 β 2 c 7 λ 3 c 8 β 3 c 9 λ 3 β 3 c 10 λ 4 1 λ 2 although this formula contains the influence of lateral pressure this effect is embodied in the polynomial form of water pressure height to express it in a general form the dimensionless parameter of lateral pressure should be considered in the formula which could also be an alternative method to guide the design of scale models in this paper the empirical formula not only contains the plate slenderness and the column slenderness as described above but also contains the non dimensional parameters of lateral pressure the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure is obtained by eq 10 dier and dowling 1980 suppose the plate slenderness the column slenderness and the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure of the prototype are defined in that case we could derive the dimensions of the scaled model and the amplitude of lateral pressure acting on the scaled model take an example to clarify the advantage during the design of a scaled model owning the same ultimate strength as the prototype the plate slenderness and the column slenderness of the prototype are 2 00 and 0 31 respectively the draft height is 12m which induces the lateral pressure with the amplitude of 0 122 mpa dimensionless value q l 0 255 the ultimate strength of this stiffened plate subjected to combined longitudinal and lateral pressure could be obtained by xu et al 2018 and the formula presented in this paper although we could conveniently maintain the slenderness of scaled model unchanged by changing the dimension of the scaled model according to the scale factor the lateral pressure acting on the scaled model could not be easily obtained by xu et al 2018 when the yield strength of the scaled model is different from that of the prototype however the values of lateral pressure acting on the scaled model could be obtained easily by keeping q l unchanged the detailed message is shown in table 5 and the corresponding load displacement curves are shown in fig 11 by maintaining the ql firmed we could obtain consistent results of σ x u l t then we could obtain the lateral pressure acting on the s t l is 0 068 mpa the lateral pressure acting on the s t h is 0 188 mpa therefore this method is easy to guide the design of lateral pressure acting on the scaled model however these values may not be easily obtained by xu et al 2018 from this point of view this kind of expression is more general without a dimensional message besides it could be chosen as a design method of the scaled model subjected to combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure 10 q l q 0 e σ y 2 first the empirical formula form is determined according to the above formula and the coefficients are acquired based on the nonlinear fea results without the effect of lateral pressure then the influence of lateral pressure was further considered as a revision for the formula although there is less description on the form of correction of lateral pressure on the ultimate strength it is considered in the form of exponential function for the reason of nonlinear effect and this function could keep the value of revision coefficient as one when lateral pressure is 0 mpa in this paper the expression of lateral pressure correction on the ultimate strength is dimensionless which is more general than that proposed by xu et al 2018 as shown in eq 11 based on the 336 nonlinear fea results of the load cases without lateral pressure the coefficients are shown in table 6 it should be noted that the average value of the ultimate strength of different kinds of stiffener with the same slenderness was used to predict the regression coefficient σ u σ y 1 c 0 q l c 1 q l β c 2 q l λ c 3 q l λ β c 4 q l β 2 c 5 q l λ 2 c 6 q l λ 2 β 2 c 7 q l β 3 c 8 q l λ 3 c 9 q l λ 3 β 3 c 10 q l λ 4 11 1 λ 2 3 2 for the load cases of combined transverse compression and lateral pressure transverse ultimate strength is mainly connected with the plate slenderness and the aspect ratio the difference of the transverse ultimate strength of the stiffened plates with different kinds of stiffeners was first compared take the load displacement curves of t1 t2 t3 t4 a1 a2 a3 a4 16p0 for an example to clarify the difference as shown in fig 12 the maximum difference of the transverse ultimate strength of stiffened plates with the same dimensions and unique types of stiffeners is below 3 3 the maximum difference of transverse ultimate strength of stiffened plate with every kind of stiffener is below 5 9 it could conclude that the type of stiffener has a minor effect on the transverse ultimate strength so that only one kind of stiffener t2 was selected to discuss the ultimate strength varying with the thickness of the attached plate and the amplitude of the lateral pressure for the load case of combined transverse compression and lateral loads the transverse ultimate strength of stiffened plate with different thicknesses of attached plate under the different lateral pressure is shown in fig 13 the impact of lateral pressure on the transverse ultimate strength is nonlinear when β is constant for the thinner attached plate the effect of lateral pressure is significant by contrast the influence of the same amplitude of lateral pressure on the transverse ultimate strength weakens gradually for the thicker attached plate take the collapse modes of t2 9 5 and t2 33 as an example to explain this phenomenon as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 the collapse mode is induced by the failure of the attached plate when the thickness of attached plate is 9 5 mm at this time the collapse mode would change as long as the lateral pressure exists however the collapse mode is overall symmetrical when the thickness of the attached plate is 33 mm which is similar to that induced by the initial deflection of the column type it should be noted that the collapse modes would not change despite the presence of lateral pressure then the transverse ultimate strength is not sensitive to lateral pressure it generally decreases with the increase of the lateral pressure for the transverse ultimate strength however a similar abnormal phenomenon to the load cases of combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure appears when the lateral pressure reaches some values that is to say the lateral pressure has two adverse effects on the failure behaviors including the increase of pre buckling strength and acceleration of yielding fujikubo et al 2005b however the influence of lateral pressure on the transverse ultimate strength could not be the same as that on the longitudinal ultimate strength for considering two aspects on the one hand the interesting behavior is not evident as that occurred in the load cases of combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure for example for the reason of the presence of lateral pressure the longitudinal ultimate strength of t2 33p0 1 would increase 3 10 by contrast the transverse ultimate strength of t2 33p 1 would increase 1 98 on the other hand the interesting behavior would not always occur at the same time for the two kinds of combined loads cases for example because of the presence of lateral pressure the longitudinal ultimate strength of t2 33p0 3 would decrease 2 32 by contrast the transverse ultimate strength of t2 33p0 3 would increase 1 65 a simple and useful formula that could predict the ultimate strength of stiffened plates reasonably would be highly desirable for practical engineering design as for the empirical formula for the transverse compressive strength there are several forms valsgard 1980 proposed a transverse ultimate strength empirical formula that is more applicable for stocky plates and slender plates than that obtained by faulkner et al 1973 as shown in eq 12 12 σ u σ y σ x u α 0 08 1 1 β 2 2 1 1 α f o r α 1 where σ x u is the axial ultimate load carrying capacity of a simply supported plate and α is the aspect ratio paik et al 2004 proposed the ultimate capacity design formula which is connected with the plate slenderness and the aspect ratio as shown in eq 13 and eq 14 13 σ y u σ y 1 α σ x u σ y 0 475 β 2 1 1 α f o r α 1 14 σ x u 0 032 β 4 0 002 β 2 1 f o r β 1 5 1 274 β f o r 1 5 β 3 0 1 248 β 2 0 283 f o r β 3 0 where σ x u is the longitudinal ultimate load carrying capacity and α is the aspect ratio regarding the impact of lateral pressure on the evaluation of transverse strength some correction factors and empirical formulas were presented the transverse compressive buckling strength correction factors c p x has been proposed to consider the impact of lateral pressure by curve fitting based on the fem results fujikubo et al 1998 as shown in eq 15 15 c p x 1 1 160 b a 0 95 p b 4 e t 4 1 75 f o r a b 2 shi and gao 2020 proposed an empirical formula for calculating the transverse ultimate strength and take the effect of lateral pressure into account transverse ultimate strength is calculated by eq 16 and that under the combined loads is calculated by eq 17 16 σ u σ y 2 05 β 3 15 β 2 1 α 14 1 β 34 85 β 2 f o r λ 0 55 a n d α 10 0 1 0

plate slenderness and the lateral pressure are the essential factors that would affect the transverse ultimate strength however the column slenderness is not the key factor in the transverse ultimate strength and the type of the stiffener is selected as 235 90 10 15 t to improve the applicability of the empirical formula for the load cases of combined transverse compression and lateral pressure enriched nonlinear fea that involves the influence of different aspect ratios were performed based on the survey of hatch cover drawings used in bulk carriers container ships and general cargo ships the aspect ratio ranges from 3 8 to 14 3 and the plate slenderness ranges from 1 1 to 3 8 can cover most cases in actual ship design shi and gao 2020 as shown in table 7 and table 8 it should be noted that some kinds of stiffened plates are not selected as the targets in table 8 for considering that the plate slenderness of them are not located between 1 1 and 3 8 for example when α is 5 and the plate thickness is 22 mm at this moment the plate slenderness is 0 90 which is not belongs to 1 1 and 3 8 and would not be chosen as the target the reduction of ultimate strength caused by lateral pressure is shown in table 9 the results indicate that the transverse ultimate capacity would reduce by 0 78 σ y at most when the lateral pressure up to 0 3 mpa for the stiffened plate with a thinner attached plate finally a new empirical formula is proposed based on the 147 fea results which involve the influence of the plate slenderness the aspect ratio and the non dimensional parameter of lateral pressure as shown in eq 18 and eq 19 18 σ u σ y 2 846 β 5 180 β 2 f q l 1 1 1 α 4 921 β 7 414 β 2 f q l 2 f o r a b 3 19 f q l 1 e 0 280 q l 0 113 q l 2 f q l 2 e 0 723 q l 0 134 q l 2 4 validation 4 1 validation of the applicability of the proposed empirical formula the comparison of dimensionless ultimate strength between numerical analysis and regression formula is shown in fig 16 it could be discovered that the results obtained from the regression formula are in good agreement with fe results the accuracy of the regression model could be evaluated by the coefficient r 2 which is statistical data that gives the measurement of the correlation between the provided results and the assessment of the results calculated by regression function xu et al 2018 and is given by eq 20 and eq 21 20 r 2 s s r s s t w i t h 0 r 2 1 21 s s t i 1 n y i y 2 s s r i 1 n y i ˆ y 2 s s e i 1 n y i y i ˆ 2 where the total sum of squares s s t and regression sum of squares s s r and error sum s s e are calculated by eq 21 y i and y i ˆ are the load bearing capacity of stiffened panels predicted for each sample point in the numerical model and regression analysis y is the mean value the corresponding coefficients between the fem results and predicted results is r x 2 0 98 and r y 2 0 93 respectively these statistical data reveals that from the perspective of design and hull reliability analysis the statistical model could give reasonable predictions furthermore the accuracy of the proposed empirical formula based on non linear fe analysis could be verified by stiffened plates collapse tests the collapse tests of stiffened plates bearing combined loads have been conducted by ma et al 2021 the description of the stiffened plate used in the experiment as follows the plate length a is 600 mm the plate breadth b is 160 mm and the amplitude of the lateral pressure is 0 0061 mpa the plate slenderness is 1 801 that is calculated by eq 1 the column slenderness is 0 679 that is also calculated by eq 1 the non dimension parameter of lateral pressure is 0 227 that is calculated by eq 10 the experimental results are compared with the results obtained by the presented empirical formula as shown in fig 17 the results predicted by the derived formula are conservative are slightly lower than that obtained in the experiment the difference between the test and formula is 4 46 which demonstrates good consistency and the reason for this is that the experiment was performed with assisting equipment which would supply extra stiffness to the structure the comparison of ultimate strength calculated by nonlinear fea and some empirical formula is shown in fig 18 and fig 19 it could be seen that the results obtained by the presented formula are usually located between the results obtained by other empirical formulas whatever the load case is combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure or combined transverse compression and lateral pressure there are several reasons that could be responsible for this phenomenon first the amplitude of initial deflection is not fixed and is adopted by experience which would work as a critical role in influencing the ultimate strength also the results of fem on behalf of the average ultimate strength of the model section and the results could be influenced by the boundary which is also a reason for this phenomenon 4 2 validation of the accuracy of the numerical models the stress strain curve of stiffened plate recorded in issc 2012 is selected as the reference to verify the effectiveness of the modeling method as shown in fig 20 the stress strain curve obtained by fea show the good consistency with that recorded in issc 2012 which proves the accuracy of modeling method furthermore the ultimate strength value corresponding to the fe model could be obtained by issc 2012 which could also confirm the accuracy of the fe modelling technique in this paper we enrich the transverse ultimate strength data by considering different aspect ratio and it should be noted that the enriched models with the same kind of stiffener t2 because the column slenderness is not the key fact in transverse ultimate strength so the transverse ultimate strength comparison is only selected the models with one kind of stiffener as shown in fig 21 5 conclusion a series of numerical simulations of stiffened plates subjected to combined loads are carried out to explore the effect of lateral pressure on the ultimate strength to improve the accuracy of ultimate strength assessment and reveal the interaction of combined loads empirical formula under the corresponding load conditions are proposed based several non dimensional parameters the presented formula could be in good agreement with the numerical results and corresponding experiments for the combined longitudinal compression and lateral pressure in view of the analysis of this research the following conclusions could be drawn 1 the appearance of lateral pressure would increase the longitudinal ultimate strength when the column slenderness is larger than 0 7 and the collapse mode is periodic symmetrical there are several reasons for this first the collapse mode of the central span behave opposite to the lateral pressure and the lateral pressure that is not enough to change the deformation trend would inhibit this deformation second the lateral pressure would change the amplitude of initial deflection of the attached plate to a certain degree and the ultimate strength would increase when the collapse mode is induced by the plate the last but not least the lateral pressure would affect the pre buckling strength that is to say the ultimate strength would increase when the pre buckling strength increase 2 considering the same stiffened plate under the same lateral pressure collapsed by longitudinal loads or transverse loads the lateral pressure effect on the longitudinal ultimate strength is unique from the transverse ultimate strength of stiffened plates for considering two aspects on the one hand the interesting behavior does not usually occur simultaneously on the other hand although the interesting behavior occurs simultaneously for two load cases this interesting behavior is more evident in collapse caused by longitudinal loads 3 the proposed empirical formula based on richer samples could be employed to improve the accuracy of ultimate strength under several combined load conditions in addition the non dimension parameter of lateral pressure is defined as follow 22 q l q 0 e σ y 2 the influence of lateral pressure is reflected in the correction of coefficient which could keep as 1 when the lateral pressure is 0 mpa as follow 23 c q l a e b q l d q l 2 where a b and d is constant 4 the lateral pressure has a significant effect on both longitudinal and transverse ultimate strength which would nearly decrease 90 when the lateral pressure reaches 0 3 mpa draft 30m the attached plate thicker the transverse ultimate strength would reduce less under the same lateral pressure besides although the column slenderness is not the key factor that would affect the transverse ultimate strength the negative effect of the lateral pressure on the ultimate strength would also reduce for the stiffened plate with a larger stiffener credit authorship contribution statement hongyang ma formal analysis data curation

20193,the undrained shear properties of remoulded clay are important in the design of offshore infrastructure the effects of thixotropy and reconsolidation on the undrained shear strength and shear modulus of remoulded marine clays were investigated by direct simple shear and bender element tests the results show that both the shear strength and shear modulus of the remoulded clays after reconsolidation are independent of the thixotropic hardening time after remoulding this indicates that the effects of thixotropy and reconsolidation on strength gain of remoulded clays are not additive compared with the intact samples both the ratio between undrained shear strength and in situ effective pressure s ud σ v0 and the ratio between shear modulus and in situ effective pressure g max σ v0 on the reconsolidated remoulded samples are much lower for the soils tested herein with over consolidated ratio ocr about 2 and higher while the rigidity index g max s ud is similar between remoulded and intact clays the ratio between reconsolidated remoulded strength and intact strength s ud rr s ud intact is dependent on the ocr of the intact soil and decreases with increasing ocr the ratio between the reconsolidated remoulded shear strength and the applied reconsolidated stress s ud rr σ vc increases with decreasing reconsolidation stress and is also related to ocr keywords remoulded marine clays thixotropy undrained shear strength shear modulus 1 introduction the undrained shear characteristics of remoulded clays are important in practical engineering when offshore piles or anchors are installed the clay along the pile or skirt wall is remoulded the remoulded shear strength and modulus as well as their changes with time after installation are required to assess the geotechnical capacity li et al 2017 gong et al 2020 the investigation of remoulded strength of soil is also critical to the analysis of slope stability tiwar et al 2005 determination of remoulded strength is far from simple and can depend on the test type and a small selection of papers e g nakase and kamei 1988 degroot et al 2012 cover this topic and recommend remoulding procedures and laboratory test devices for measuring the remoulded shear strength of clays in practice the change in shear strength with time of remoulded clays soon after the installation of piles or anchors mainly comes from the following two aspects one is thixotropic hardening primarily due to the recovery of soil structures or fabrics between particles happening at the constant water content and volume mitchell 1961 andersen and jostad 2002 the other is reconsolidation caused by effective stress change from total stress change and pore pressure redistribution andersen and jostad 2002 jeanjean 2006 zakeri et al 2014 the thixotropic phenomenon of geotechnical materials has long been recognised in the field of both geological and geotechnical engineering numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the thixotropic behavior of sediments e g skempton and northey 1952 molope et al 1985 lu et al 1991 andersen and jostad 2002 2004 seng and tanaka 2012 shahriar et al 2018 among others ren et al 2021 presented a comprehensive literature review on the thixotropic behavior of soft clay many researchers tried to reveal the mechanism of thixotropy from the microscopic point of view mitchell 1961 jacobsson and pusch 1972 osipov et al 1984 zhang et al 2017 aminpour 2019 peng et al 2021 based on a database from laboratory tests andersen and jostad 2002 2004 and lunne and andersen 2007 summarized and recommended lower and upper limits of the thixotropy strength ratio a t the ratio of the shear strength after a thixotropic hardening time and the remoulded strength versus plasticity index and activity for bearing capacity calculations and suction anchor design yang and andersen 2016 found that the higher the water content plasticity index and liquidity index is the higher the thixotropy strength ratio will be lately the results from yang et al 2020 show that both the undrained shear strength and shear modulus of remoulded marine clays increase with time due to thixotropy after installation of piles or suction anchors thixotropy and reconsolidation might happen simultaneously in the surrounding remoulded clays many researchers jeanjean 2006 zakeri et al 2014 believed that the strength regain shortly after the installation might be mainly attributed to the thixotropic effect andersen and jostad 2002 assumed for calculation purposes that thixotropy and reconsolidation are not connected and that they occur independently of each other based on pile load tests at 23 sites karlsrud 2012 concluded that the thixotropic effect might run more or less in parallel with the reconsolidation up to 30 50 pore pressure dissipation abu farsakh et al 2015 used the finite element method considering both the thixotropic effect by introducing a time dependent parameter and the reconsolidated effect to simulate pile installation and the results are in good agreement with the field measurements similarly li et al 2017 and gong et al 2020 introduced a time dependent empirical reduction factor to incorporate the thixotropic effect on the friction angle between the soil and pile interface seng and tanaka 2012 focused on the thixotropic effect on soil stiffness under low consolidation pressure and they found that the increase in shear modulus under secondary consolidation is relatively low compared with that developed during the thixotropic process however to the authors knowledge the interaction between the strength regain of remoulded clays from thixotropy and reconsolidation is still ambiguous and it is difficult to separate the individual effects of the two processes in the light of the above the effects of the thixotropy and reconsolidation on the undrained shear characteristics of remoulded clays therefore need to be further studied to provide reasonable input for design purposes this paper presents a systematic experimental study of shear strength and shear modulus on reconsolidated remoulded clays a particular objective is to provide evidence on effects of interaction between thixotropy and reconsolidation of soft clays and the effect of reconsolidation at different stress levels on the thixotropic hardening shear strength and shear modulus of remoulded clays is discussed since undrained shear strength of remoulded clays is important to geotechnical design and construction a better understanding of the contribution from reconsolidation to strength could have a significant practical impact therefore the shear strength of reconsolidated remoulded clays and its characteristics is further analysed and evaluated in respect to normalized values s ud σ v0 g max σ v0 g max s ud s ud rr s ud intact and s ud rr σ vc and its relation to ocr 2 selected clays and testing procedures 2 1 tested clays and index properties in total 4 deep water marine clays were selected in this study two clays were recovered from different locations in offshore ghana ghana l and ghana p respectively the third one was collected from the northern continental slope in the south china sea china scs and the final one was from the western offshore brazil brazil 1 the basic index properties of the tested clays are summarized in table 1 the symbol w is denoted as the natural water content of the tested clays sensitivity s t was defined as the ratio of intact and remoulded undrained shear strengths measured by the fall cone method ns en iso 17892 6 2017 the remoulded shear strength can depend on the test type degroot et al 2012 but it is believed that the change in strength due to thixotropy is more test independent compared with other test methods the fall cone test is an easy and fast method to obtain the shear strength of cohesive soils and was therefore used to measure change in strength due to thixotropy in this study atterberg limits were measured based on the ns en iso 17892 12 2018 standard and the plasticity index i p and liquidity index i l could be calculated respectively clay contents were obtained through particle size distribution measured by falling drop method and calculated in accordance with ns en iso 17892 4 2016 standard the relationship between sensitivity and liquidity index of clays in this study was approximately in agreement with the trend line of skempton and northey 1952 the sample disturbance or sample quality was evaluated by the method proposed by lunne et al 1997 and the quality of the samples used in this study was good to fair or poor the classification of clays in this study was made by plasticity chart according to uscs astm d2487 17 2017 over consolidation ratio ocr was determined by casagrande method according to the results from constant rate of strain consolidation crsc test astm d4186 on intact clays 2 2 testing methods the undrained shear strength of the samples was measured by direct simple shear dss test and the apparatus used in this study was the ngi type as described in bjerrum and landva 1966 a cylindrical specimen with cross sectional area of 35 cm2 and height of 16 mm was placed within a reinforced rubber membrane which prevented radial deformation but allowed the specimen to be deformed in simple shear before shearing the specimen was usually consolidated in four steps after consolidation the specimen was sheared in an undrained condition by keeping the volume constant through increasing or decreasing the axial stress the change in the axial stress was equal to the change in pore pressure the rate of shearing was approximately 4 5 hour and the undrained shear strength of the specimen was defined as the shear stress at 15 shear strain if no distinct peak occurred at lower strain levels the shear modulus of the sample was obtained by a bender element test at very small strain normally shear strain levels of about 10 5 or below equipped in the dss apparatus the bender element be used in this study was a pair of piezoceramics embedded in the upper and lower dss caps the heights of transmitter and receiver element penetrating into the specimen were 4 05 mm and 4 06 mm respectively a sinusoidal signal wave was used with wide range of frequencies to obtain a clear output waveform the start to start method for determining the arrival time δt and tip to tip method for determining the travel distances δd of the shear wave were adopted viggiani and atkinson 1995 the shear wave velocity v s could be calculated by δd δt based on the elastic body theory then the shear modulus of sample g max could be obtained by 1 g max ρ v s 2 where ρ is the total density of the specimen in g cm3 2 3 testing procedure and program firstly the intact undrained shear strength s ud intact of all selected clays was measured by in the dss test with an applied consolidation stress equal to the in situ vertical effective stress σ v0 then a batch of clay was thoroughly remoulded with an effort to maintain a constant water content and to minimize entrapment of air the remoulded shear strength can be influenced by the way the remoulding is done degroot et al 2012 in this study the clay was placed in a sealed plastic bag avoiding trapped air and then it was kneaded by hand for soft ones or beaten several times by rubber hammer for harder ones the clays in this study were all overconsolidated and the particle arrangement due to over consolidation and original structure was fully destroyed by the remoulding process the uniformity of the remoulded sample was further checked through both water content and fall cone strength the difference of water content and undrained shear strength at different parts of the samples should be controlled within 0 5 and 0 1 kpa respectively if not the remoulding process would be done once again until meeting the criteria one sample was reconsolidated to the same consolidation stress as the intact sample immediately 0 days after remoulding and sheared the samples that were not reconsolidated and tested immediately were placed in transparent plastic containers with a diameter of 8 cm and a height of 5 cm the containers were carefully wrapped with layers of cling film and then placed into a clear plastic bag in which some soaked wet tissues were placed to maintain the moisture content all the prepared specimens were stored in the sample storage room where the temperature was around 7 c and the humidity was greater than 95 one sample was then retrieved from the storage room at each selected hardening time the time between remoulding and reconsolidation typically 3 h 12 h 1 day 5 days 10 days 30 days and 60 days after remoulding were selected as hardening time for ghana l ghana p and china scs clays and 3 days and 10 days as hardening time after remoulding for brazil 1 clay at the selected hardening time the samples were built into the dss apparatus and reconsolidated to different stress levels σ vc σ v0 1 0 0 5 or 0 1 the consolidation pressure was applied by four steps i e 1 8 1 8 1 4 and 1 2 times final consolidation stress respectively until fully consolidated and then the specimen was sheared to obtain the reconsolidated remoulded undrained shear strength s ud rr it should be noted that the experimental laboratory program may not exactly simulate the real life process in situ where thixotropy and reconsolidation may occur simultaneously in many cases however the thixotropy dominates in the beginning and the reconsolidation is slower jeanjean 2006 zakeri et al 2014 the tests in this program where reconsolidation is applied after a given period with thixotropic hardening can be representative for this situation a summary of the detailed testing program is shown in table 2 the maximum shear modulus g max was also measured by be test for all samples before dss shearing in addition to the dss and be tests an intensive thixotropy test program was carried out on eight clays including the four clays in this study the experimental results were reported in yang et al 2020 3 test results and discussions 3 1 the effect of reconsolidation on thixotropy fig 1 presents the undrained shear strength and shear modulus normalized by the in situ vertical effective stress for intact and reconsolidated remoulded clays ghana l ghana p and china scs at different hardening times the results show that the normalized shear strength of reconsolidated remoulded samples is lower than that of intact samples as presented in fig 1 a in particular the difference of strength between the intact and reconsolidated remoulded sample of china scs clay is much more significant than for the other two clays this is due to the higher intact ocr equal to 5 for the china scs clay generally the normalized shear strength of over consolidated clay is higher than that of normally consolidated clay and the normalized shear strength will increase with increasing ocr as expected the trend is the same for the normalized shear modulus in fig 1 b it is noticeable that neither the normalized reconsolidated remoulded strength nor the shear modulus changes much with hardening time fig 2 presented the recovery of shear strength and shear modulus of remoulded clays normalized by the remoulded values with the same time due to pure thixotropic effect without applying any consolidation stress the thixotropy modulus ratio c t was the ratio between the shear modulus after thixotropic time and the remoulded shear modulus it shows that the increases of both shear strength and shear modulus of tested clays were remarkable however after reconsolidated back to the in situ effective stress in the dss test the thixotropic effect on the gain of strength or modulus was almost fully erased see fig 1 rr means reconsolidated remoulded this indicates that the thixotropy effect on the gain of strength or modulus is erased by the reconsolidation back to the in situ effective stress one likely interpretation for this is that the bonds or connections between clay particles formed by thixotropy are destroyed by the reconsolidation to the in situ effective stress in order to examine the effect of reconsolidation at lower stress levels on the thixotropy of clay further dss and be tests with reconsolidation to 0 1 σ v0 brazil 1 clay and 0 5 σ v0 ghana p clay at different hardening time were carried out and the results are presented in fig 3 it is shown that both the normalized shear strength and modulus are independent of the hardening time after remoulding this means that the thixotropy effect seems to be erased by the reconsolidation back to even lower stress levels than the initial in situ effective stress furthermore it proves the assumption by andersen and jostad 2002 that the thixotropy and reconsolidation impacts on strength gain of clays with time are not additive the rigidity index ratio of shear modulus and shear strength g max s ud for samples consolidated to σ v0 is presented in fig 4 it shows that this ratio of reconsolidated remoulded samples for all clays does not change very much with hardening time but the difference of rigidity index between the reconsolidated remoulded samples and intact samples is much less than the individual values of both s ud σ v0 and g max σ v0 in fig 1 this shows that the change of shear strength and shear modulus for clay before and after remoulding with the same consolidation stress is more or less synchronous the relationship between g max s ud and i p of test clays in this study as well as the results from andersen 2004 and andersen et al 2008 are plotted in fig 5 the numbers written beside each point marked in represent the ocr values related to the specific clays it shows that there is a clear tendency for the g max s ud to decrease with increasing i p and the feature has the remarkable reduction in g max s ud against the i p values up to 50 in addition there is also a reduction in g max s ud with increasing ocr it presents that the data of clays used in this study basically locate in the range of the database which means the g max s ud i p behavior agrees with the above trend 3 2 the role of reconsolidation in shear strength of remoulded clay as discussed above the long term strength of remoulded clay mainly depends on the reconsolidation stress level with the dissipation of excess pore pressure caused by penetration of a suction anchor the effective overburden stress of surrounding remoulded clay will gradually increase and its shear strength will gain with time the ratio between the reconsolidated remoulded shear strength and the intact strength s ud rr s ud intact of samples is presented in fig 6 as a function of the in situ ocr of the intact clay the figure includes the experimental results from andersen et al 2008 supplemented with the data from the dss test herein as well as from two other clays china ys2 and caspian sea 1 presented in yang et al 2020 the results show that the strength of normally consolidated clays ocr 1 after remoulding is roughly 0 30 higher than the strength of intact ones due to water content reduction during reconsolidation the overconsolidated clays cannot reach their original strength after remoulding and the ratio s ud rr s ud intact decreases with increasing ocr when the clays are highly overconsolidated with ocr larger than 10 the strength of most reconsolidated remoulded clays is less than 30 of the intact strength that being said the reconsolidation stress will not in all cases come back to the original in situ effective stress or the reconsolidation can take a long time therefore it is of interest to investigate the reconsolidated remoulded strength as function of the reconsolidation stress in general the strength normalized by the consolidation stress increases with decreasing consolidation stress for a given ocr for intact clays andersen 2015 fig 7 presents the test results from this study as well as data from the previous andersen et al 2008 study and more recent data including results from two other clays china ys2 and caspian sea 1 as described in yang et al 2020 the normalized shear strength for one particular clay at different reconsolidation stress levels is connected by lines the solid lines marked by the symbol mean the clays with ocr 1 5 and the broken lines marked by the symbol mean the clays with ocr 1 5 the new data confirms that the reconsolidated remoulded strength ratio s ud rr σ vc depends on the reconsolidation stress and the ocr and validates the former database in figs 6 and 7 furthermore the tested clays in this study extend the results to an even lower consolidation stress 4 conclusions the undrained shear strength and shear modulus of reconsolidated remoulded clays was measured by dss and be test in this study the interaction between thixotropy and reconsolidation was analysed and the effect of reconsolidation at different stress levels on the thixotropic hardening of remoulded clays was discussed based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the thixotropy effect on the gain of both shear strength and shear modulus is erased by reconsolidation even with a small reconsolidation stress of 10 of the initial in situ effective stress this means that the strength gain of clay with time from thixotropy and reconsolidation is not additive 2 both s ud σ v0 and g max σ v0 ratios of reconsolidated remoulded samples are lower than those of intact samples for the soils tested herein with ocr about 2 and higher however the rigidity index g max s ud is similar for reconsolidated remoulded samples and intact samples there is a clear tendency for the g max s ud to decrease with increasing i p and there is a reduction in g max s ud with increasing ocr 3 under the in situ vertical effective stress the strength of normally consolidated clays after remoulding is roughly 0 30 higher than the strength of intact clays however the overconsolidated clays cannot regain their original strength after remoulding and the ratio s ud rr s ud intact decreases with increasing ocr 4 the ratio s ud rr σ vc of reconsolidated remoulded clay increases with decreasing reconsolidation stress and also depends on the ocr credit authorship contribution

20193,the undrained shear properties of remoulded clay are important in the design of offshore infrastructure the effects of thixotropy and reconsolidation on the undrained shear strength and shear modulus of remoulded marine clays were investigated by direct simple shear and bender element tests the results show that both the shear strength and shear modulus of the remoulded clays after

remoulded marine clays thixotropy undrained shear strength shear modulus 1 introduction the undrained shear characteristics of remoulded clays are important in practical engineering when offshore

after installation of piles or suction anchors thixotropy and reconsolidation might happen simultaneously in the surrounding remoulded clays many researchers jeanjean 2006 zakeri et al 2014 believed

and shear modulus of remoulded clays is discussed since undrained shear strength of remoulded clays is important to geotechnical design and construction a better understanding of the contribution from

was measured by direct simple shear dss test and the apparatus used in this study was the ngi type as described in bjerrum and landva 1966 a cylindrical specimen with cross sectional area of 35 cm2 and height of 16 mm was placed within a reinforced rubber membrane which prevented radial deformation but allowed the specimen to be deformed in simple shear before shearing the specimen was usually consolidated in four steps after consolidation the specimen was sheared in an undrained condition by keeping the volume constant through increasing or decreasing the axial stress the change in the axial stress was equal to the change in pore pressure the rate of shearing was approximately 4 5 hour and the undrained shear strength of the specimen was defined as the shear stress at 15 shear

program firstly the intact undrained shear strength s ud intact of all selected clays was measured by in the dss test with an applied consolidation stress equal to the in situ vertical effective stress σ v0 then a batch of clay was thoroughly remoulded with an effort to maintain a constant water content and to minimize entrapment of air the remoulded shear strength can be influenced by the way the remoulding is done degroot et al 2012 in this study the clay was placed in a sealed plastic bag avoiding trapped air and then it was kneaded by hand for soft ones or beaten several times by rubber hammer for harder ones the clays in this study were all overconsolidated and the particle arrangement due to over consolidation and original structure was fully destroyed by the remoulding process the uniformity of the remoulded sample was further checked through both water content and fall cone strength the difference of water content and undrained shear strength at different parts of the samples should be controlled within 0 5 and 0 1 kpa respectively if not the remoulding process would be done once again until meeting the criteria one sample was reconsolidated to the same consolidation stress as the intact sample immediately 0 days after remoulding and sheared the samples that were not reconsolidated and tested immediately were placed in transparent plastic containers

maintain the moisture content all the prepared specimens were stored in the sample storage room where the temperature was around 7 c and the humidity was greater than 95 one sample was then retrieved from the storage room at each selected hardening time the time between remoulding and reconsolidation typically 3 h 12 h 1 day 5 days 10 days 30 days and 60 days after remoulding were selected as hardening time for ghana l ghana p and china scs clays and 3 days and 10 days as hardening time after remoulding for brazil 1 clay at the selected hardening time the samples were built into the dss

reconsolidation is slower jeanjean 2006 zakeri et al 2014 the tests in this program where reconsolidation is applied after a given period with thixotropic hardening can be representative for this situation a summary of the detailed testing program is shown in table 2 the maximum shear modulus g max was also measured by be test for all samples before dss shearing in addition to the dss and be tests an intensive thixotropy test program was carried out on eight clays including the four clays in this study the experimental results were reported in yang et al 2020 3 test results and discussions 3 1 the effect of reconsolidation on thixotropy fig 1 presents the undrained shear strength and shear modulus normalized by the in situ vertical effective stress for intact and reconsolidated remoulded clays ghana l ghana p and china scs at different hardening times the results show that the normalized shear strength of reconsolidated remoulded samples is lower than that of intact samples as presented in fig 1 a in particular the difference of strength between the intact and reconsolidated remoulded sample of china scs clay is much more significant than for the other two clays this is due to the higher intact ocr equal to 5 for the china scs clay generally the normalized shear strength of over consolidated clay is higher than that of normally consolidated clay and the normalized shear strength will increase with increasing ocr as expected the trend is the same for the normalized shear modulus in fig 1 b it is noticeable that neither the normalized reconsolidated remoulded strength nor the shear modulus changes much with hardening time fig 2 presented the recovery of shear strength and shear modulus of remoulded clays normalized by the remoulded values with the same time due to pure thixotropic effect without applying any consolidation stress the thixotropy modulus ratio c t was the ratio between the shear modulus after thixotropic time and the remoulded shear modulus it shows that the increases of both shear strength and shear modulus of tested clays were remarkable however after reconsolidated back to the in situ effective stress in the dss test the thixotropic effect on the gain of strength or modulus was almost fully erased see fig 1 rr means reconsolidated remoulded this indicates that the thixotropy effect on the gain of strength or modulus is erased by the reconsolidation back to the in situ effective stress one likely interpretation for this is that the bonds or connections between clay particles formed by thixotropy are destroyed by the reconsolidation to the in situ effective stress in order to examine the effect of reconsolidation at lower stress levels on the thixotropy of clay further dss and be tests with reconsolidation to 0 1 σ v0 brazil 1 clay and 0 5 σ v0 ghana p clay at different hardening time were carried out and the results are presented in fig 3 it is shown that both the normalized shear strength and modulus are independent of the hardening time after remoulding this means that the thixotropy effect seems to be erased by the reconsolidation back to even lower stress levels than the initial in situ effective stress furthermore it proves the assumption by andersen and jostad 2002 that the thixotropy and reconsolidation impacts on strength gain of clays with time are not additive the rigidity index ratio of shear modulus and shear strength g max s ud for samples consolidated to σ v0 is presented in fig 4 it shows that this ratio of reconsolidated remoulded samples for all clays does not change very much with hardening time but the difference of rigidity index between the reconsolidated remoulded samples and intact samples is much less than the individual values of both s ud σ v0 and g max σ v0 in fig 1 this shows that the change of shear strength and shear modulus for clay before and after remoulding with the same consolidation stress is more or less synchronous the relationship between g max s ud and i p of test clays in this study as well as the results from andersen 2004 and andersen et al 2008 are plotted in fig 5 the numbers written beside each point marked in represent the ocr values related to the specific clays it shows that there is a clear tendency for the g max s ud to decrease with increasing i p and the feature has the remarkable reduction in g max s ud against the i p values up to 50 in addition there is also a reduction in g max s ud with increasing ocr it presents that the data of clays used in this study basically locate in the range of the database which means the g max s ud i p behavior agrees with the above trend 3 2 the role of reconsolidation in shear strength of remoulded clay as discussed above the long term strength of remoulded clay mainly depends on the reconsolidation stress level with the dissipation of excess pore pressure caused by penetration of a suction anchor the effective overburden stress of surrounding remoulded clay will gradually increase and its shear strength will gain with time the ratio between the reconsolidated remoulded shear strength and the intact strength s ud rr s ud intact of samples is presented in fig 6 as a function of the in situ ocr of the intact clay the figure includes the experimental results from andersen et al 2008 supplemented with the data from the dss test herein as well as from two other clays china ys2 and caspian sea 1 presented in yang et al 2020 the results show that the strength of normally consolidated clays ocr 1 after remoulding is roughly 0 30 higher than the strength of intact ones due to water content reduction during reconsolidation the overconsolidated clays cannot reach their original strength after remoulding and the ratio s ud rr s ud intact decreases with increasing ocr when the clays are highly overconsolidated with ocr larger than 10 the strength of most reconsolidated remoulded clays is less than 30 of the intact strength that being said the reconsolidation stress will not in all cases come back to the original in situ effective stress or the reconsolidation can take a long time therefore it is of interest to investigate the reconsolidated remoulded strength as function of the reconsolidation stress in general the strength normalized by the consolidation stress increases with decreasing consolidation stress for a given ocr for intact clays andersen 2015 fig 7 presents the test results from this study as well as data from the previous andersen et al 2008 study and more recent data including results from two other clays china ys2 and caspian sea 1 as described in yang et al 2020 the normalized shear strength for one particular clay at different reconsolidation stress levels is connected by lines the solid lines marked by the symbol mean the clays with ocr 1 5 and the broken lines marked by the symbol mean the clays with ocr 1 5 the new data confirms that the reconsolidated remoulded strength ratio s ud rr σ vc depends on the reconsolidation stress and the ocr and validates the former database in figs 6 and 7 furthermore the tested clays in this study extend the results to an even lower consolidation stress 4 conclusions the undrained shear strength and shear modulus of reconsolidated remoulded clays was measured by dss and be test in this study the interaction between thixotropy and reconsolidation was analysed and the effect of reconsolidation at different stress levels on the thixotropic hardening of remoulded clays was discussed based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the thixotropy effect on the gain of both shear strength and shear modulus is erased by reconsolidation even with a small reconsolidation stress of 10 of the initial in situ effective stress this means that the strength gain of clay with time from thixotropy and reconsolidation is not additive 2 both s ud σ v0 and g max σ v0 ratios of reconsolidated remoulded samples are lower than those of intact samples for the soils tested herein with ocr about 2 and higher however the rigidity index g max s ud is similar for reconsolidated remoulded samples and intact samples there is a clear tendency for the g max s ud to decrease with increasing i p and there is a reduction in g max s ud with increasing ocr 3 under the in situ vertical effective stress the strength of normally consolidated clays after remoulding is roughly 0 30 higher than the strength of intact clays however the overconsolidated clays cannot regain their original strength after remoulding and the ratio s ud rr s ud intact decreases with increasing ocr 4 the ratio s ud rr σ vc of reconsolidated remoulded clay increases with decreasing reconsolidation stress and also depends on the ocr credit authorship contribution

20194,the structures on the coral islands are at risk of earthquakes to study the particular seismic response of coral sand the numerical model of the coral sand pile superstructure system was established using flac3d the hysteresis damping is used to describe the constitutive shear modulus attenuation and hysteresis of coral sand under cyclic stress the results show that although the increasing pile length magnifies the soil dynamic response the superstructure settlement decreases with the increasing pile length increasing the coral sand relative density reduces the development of the excess pore pressure ratio of the soil but it amplifies the pile bending moment keywords numerical simulation coral sand seismic response soil pile superstructure liquefaction 1 introduction coral sand is a special geotechnical material derived from marine organisms which is present in the seaboard and reefs of mexico persian gulf south china sea and australia xiao et al 2018 a large number of coral polyps are calcified and stacked and then undergo various geological processes with the remains of other marine organisms such as seaweeds and shells to form coral sand therefore the main component of coral sand is calcium carbonate with a content of more than 90 and coral sand retains the skeletal structure of corals which leads to its high angularity complex shape fragile fracture and internal pores coral sand and common terrestrial sand such as quartz sand have obvious differences in physical and mechanical properties lv et al 2019 wang et al 2011 in recent years coral sand is mainly used as foundation material for buildings seawalls embankments and airport runways in marine engineering rajesh and choudhury 2016 wang et al 2011 however the dynamic instabilities of coral sand sites due to earthquakes tsunamis and other dynamic actions occur from time to time green et al 2011 olson et al 2011 many scholars have explored the unique seismic liquefaction characteristics of coral sand through dynamic triaxial tests and other methods salem et al 2013 sandoval and pando 2012 however these studies mainly focus on the liquefaction characteristics of coral sand itself there are various structures on the coral sand and the interaction between the coral sand and the structure under earthquake has great influence on the dynamic response of the coral sand site 1 g and centrifuge shaking table tests chen et al 2016 dadfar et al 2016 ferdosi et al 2015a murao et al 2018 nakai et al 2017 su et al 2019 yazdandoust 2017 2018 analytical analyses chatterjee et al 2015 chiou et al 2020 dadfar et al 2016 dai et al 2020 le et al 2020 nakai et al 2017 and numerical simulations ferdosi et al 2015a b hasheminezhad and bahadori 2019 he et al 2020 lim and jeong 2020 zou et al 2020 are important methods to explore the seismic response of soil structure system however these studies mainly focus on the terrigenous sand there are few researches on the coral sand liu et al analyzed the seismic response of the block type gravity quay walls in the coral sand site through the centrifuge test and the finite difference method the effects of input acceleration intensity and frequency sand relative density sand permeability and other factors on the dynamic characteristics of gravity quay walls and backfill foundations are discussed liu et al 2020 wu et al carried out 1 g shaking table tests on the dynamic response of the soil pile superstructure system in the coral sand and found that the increase in the number of piles will amplify the dynamic response of the system and promote the liquefaction of the soil but the final settlement of the superstructure will decrease wu et al 2020a 2020b ding et al measured and analyzed the acceleration displacement and bending moment of the underground structures as well as the acceleration and settlement of coral sand under different groundwater levels ding et al 2021 bao et al established a two dimensional seismic analysis model of the coral reef seawater system under the action of obliquely incident p waves and sv waves bao et al 2020 as a commonly used foundation form pile foundation will be more and more widely used in the construction of coral reefs the seismic response of superstructure supported by the pile foundation in coral sand is worthy of attention in this study based on the fully nonlinear finite difference software flac3d the hysteresis damping is used to describe the particular shear modulus degradation of coral sand foundation under earthquakes and the numerical model of dynamic interaction of coral sand pile superstructure system is established the numerical model is verified through the results of the shaking table model tests on this basis the influence of pile length sand relative density and sand permeability on the seismic response of coral sand pile superstructure system is discussed and analyzed 2 overview of the physical model the physical model test was carried out using the anco shaking table produced by anco company america the shaking table can simulate three dimensional and six degree of freedom seismic vibration a 5 hz sine wave was applied as the vibration excitation and a shear type model box was used to simulate the free horizontal vibration of different layers of soil as shown in fig 1 according to the similarity design plexiglass was used to make the superstructure supported by nine pile foundation the specific process and sensor arrangement of the test can be found in the research of wu et al 2020a 3 numerical model the flac3d is used to simulate the seismic response of coral sand sites considering soil pile structure interaction in view of the limitations of general finite element software for large deformation simulation of sand liquefaction the particles of coral sand will not be broken considering the stress conditions of the numerical calculations in this study due to the small size of the model test the numerical calculation time will be very long when the shaking table test prototype is simulated in order to improve the calculation efficiency the geometric size of the shaking table test is appropriately enlarged 20 times as shown in fig 2 parameters are also converted according to the similarity law 3 1 numerical mesh and boundary conditions as shown in fig 3 the established numerical model has 26 407 solid mesh nodes 22 276 solid elements and 137 structural element nodes in the static calculation phase the bottom of the model is set as a fixed boundary to constrain the normal displacement around the model after the in situ stress balance in the static calculation stage is completed the dynamic analysis stage is started the surrounding boundary conditions are transformed into free field boundary to eliminate the distortion of surface waves on the boundary since the bottom element of the model is soil the dynamic load application in this study needs to convert the acceleration time history into stress time history and then apply it to the bottom of the model the specific conversion relationship is shown in eq 1 and 2 1 σ n 2 ρ c p v n 2 σ s 2 ρ c s v s where σ n and σ s represent the normal and tangential stresses applied to the bottom of the model respectively ρ is the density of the soil c p and c s are the speeds of p wave and s wave respectively and v n and v s are the velocity components in the normal and tangential directions respectively 3 2 soil constitutive model and property parameters a reasonable description of the hysteresis characteristics of soil is important in selecting the constitutive model of soil in the general equivalent linear analysis the massing n times method is used to transform the stress strain path curve backbone curve to describe the soil hysteresis while flac3d uses a completely nonlinear dynamic analysis method to consider the hysteresis of the soil and describes the constitutive relationship of the soil through the damp furthermore in flac3d 5 0 and later versions a hysteresis damping model has been added to the program to more accurately reflect the energy absorbing of the soil in this study a four parameter model is used to describe the particular attenuation of the soil shear modulus in the case of a large shear strain the deformation response of the soil will be overestimated due to excessive deterioration of the modulus which is inconsistent with the actual situation therefore in the numerical simulation of this study the modulus attenuation curve is truncated that is the soil shear modulus no longer continues to decrease with the increase of shear strain but maintains a fixed value when the shear modulus is reduced to a certain value rayhani and el naggar 2008a 2008b zou et al 2019 2020 the constitutive model used in this study is finn model the corresponding command is model finn range group soil it is worth noting that due to the application of the hysteresis damping the shear stress strain relationship of the finn model is not a simple ideal elastic plastic model lópez jiménez et al 2019 mahmoud et al 2020 sun and dias 2019 sun et al 2019 the performance of the constitutive model in simple loading scenarios is shown in fig 4 a due to the superimposed hysteresis damping even if the simple finn constitutive model is used in the calculation the particular shear modulus degradation of the coral sand is simulated in this study as shown in fig 4 b carraro and bortolotto 2015 jafarian et al 2018 liang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 wang 2015 the attenuation curve of the coral sand shear modulus with shear strain in the numerical simulation refers to the results obtained by liang et al 2020 because its conditions including particle gradation and soil stress conditions are most similar to those in the shaking table test simulated the parameters a b x 0 and y 0 in four parameter model are calculated to be 0 9300 0 4019 1 2622 and 0 9848 respectively the pore water pressure accumulation is described using the finn model a volumetric strain control model based on the mohr coulomb model in this numeral calculation the value of c 1 in the byrne method of the finn model is obtained by the empirical method related to the relative density of the soil other calculation parameters of coral sand are determined based on previous test data and experience jafarian et al 2018 yang and sze 2011 the constitutive model porosity shear modulus bulk modulus friction angle permeability coefficient c 1 and c 2 of coral sand are mc 0 55 30 mpa 40 mpa 34 1 72 10 3 cm s 1 0 56 and 0 71 respectively the cohesion of coral sand is taken as 0 the raft and pile are simulated by solid elements which is set as an impervious material and the constitutive model of the raft and pile is elastic the frame structure column and slab are simulated by the structural elements the column adopts beam elements the plate adopts shell elements the columns slabs and rafts are all set as rigid connections and the frame structure applies 5 rayleigh damping to reflect the damping energy dissipation of the material the minimum center frequency of rayleigh damping is determined to be 3 5 hz by referring to the natural frequency of the low order mode shape of the model according to experimental observations the structure does not appear plastic failure during the earthquake so the concrete structural elements is modeled as linear elastic the density elastic modulus and poisson ratio of structure are elastic 2400 kg m 3 30 000 mpa and 0 2 respectively 3 3 soil pile superstructure interface during the seismic liquefaction of sand the sand often has flow deformation at the bottom of the superstructure or on the side of the pile haeri et al 2012 li et al 2018 motamed and towhata 2010 to simulate this situation in actual earthquakes interface elements with no thickness are set at the contact position between the soil and the superstructure and the contact position between the soil and the pile the interface element in flac3d can simulate the gluing bonding slippage and separation between two materials since the soil simulated in this study is sand the interface element is mainly adopted to describe the slippage between the sand and the structure the pile side interface and the pile end interface have different node ids at the intersection point to reflect the different forces on the pile side and pile end according to the sand type simulated and the soil structure slip separation the normal stiffness and shear stiffness of the interface are taken as 2 107 kpa m the cohesion of the interface is taken as 0 the value of the friction angle is the same as that of sand which is 32 4 numerical results and verification the sine wave with a frequency of 5 hz in the shaking table test shown in fig 1 is converted according to the similarity ratio and input into the numerical model to discuss the mesh convergence the computed excess pore water pressure ratio epwpr at p1 and p2 position are shown in fig 5 when the mesh density is doubled for the convenience of analysis the numerical results are unified to the model scale and compared with that in the shaking table test it can be seen that the epwpr results remain approximately the same in addition the final settlement of the superstructure under the original and doubled mesh densities is 10 59 mm and 10 57 mm respectively and the difference is very small thus the mesh is convergent in this numeral calculation the verification of the numerical model is based on the shaking table test that has been performed 4 1 development of excess pore pressure fig 6 represents the comparison of the epwpr in the numerical calculation and the model test the simulation results are basically consistent with the experimental results in terms of the generation and development of epwpr the epwpr gradually increases when the depth decreases numerical simulation can basically reflect the development of excess pore pressure during earthquakes the calculation of the epwpr in the numerical simulation uses the same method as that in the test as shown in eq 3 so the peak epwpr calculated by the numerical simulation may also be greater than 1 0 3 r u u σ v 0 where δu and σ v0 are excess pore pressure and initial effective vertical stress respectively in the calculation of the initial effective vertical stress the additional stress of the superstructure to the soil is considered 4 2 horizontal accelerations the acceleration amplification factors after the initial liquefaction occurs after 2 s are shown in fig 7 the numerical results are basically consistent with the test record on the trend of acceleration with depth as the depth decreases the epwpr increases and the acceleration shear transmission capacity of the sand decreases therefore the acceleration amplification factor gradually decreases when the depth decreases the numerical simulation can basically reflect the transmission law of acceleration in soil during earthquakes 4 3 variation in the settlement the settlement time histories of the superstructure are shown in fig 8 although the final superstructure settlement obtained by the numerical simulation is smaller than that in the test the development trend of the superstructure settlement in the numerical simulation and the test are basically the same during the earthquake the superstructure sinks in a nearly linear manner over time the settlement contour of coral sand foundation at 5 s is shown in fig 9 the settlement variation of the coral sand foundation conforms to the general seismic response 4 4 dynamic bending moment the comparison of the peak bending moment in the numerical simulation and the test is shown in fig 10 the variation of the peak moment of the superstructure column along the height in the numerical simulation is basically the same as that in the test the peak moment of the pile in the numerical simulation along the depth is also basically the same as that in the test and the peak moment takes the maximum value at the top of the pile the peak value of the moment in the numerical calculation and the test is basically the same therefore the numerical simulation can basically reflect the dynamic response of the superstructure column and pile during the earthquake 4 5 spectrum response fig 11 shows the acceleration spectrum at the first layer of the superstructure calculated by the fast fourier transform under 5 damping since the input excitation is a sine wave with a frequency of 5 hz the main frequency of the acceleration spectrum recorded by the test and numerical simulation is both 5 hz compared with the input excitation the acceleration spectrum exhibits high frequency attenuation and low frequency amplification the amplitude of the acceleration spectrum in the test and numerical simulation has basically the same changing trend in each frequency range therefore the numerical model can simulate the propagation and attenuation of the acceleration in the soil pile superstructure system 5 parametric study and discussion based on the verified numerical model of the coral sand pile superstructure system the influence of pile length coral sand relative density and coral sand permeability on the dynamic response of the coral sand site is discussed the similarities and differences of the epwpr acceleration settlement and so on are compared 5 1 effect of pile length 5 1 1 seismic response of coral sand the time histories of the epwpr of the coral sand for different pile lengths are shown in fig 12 the generation and development of the epwpr under different pile lengths are basically the same the epwpr at the p2 p3 and p4 with larger depths first increases and then decreases with time at the position p1 where the depth is small the epwpr first increases and then gradually increases with time when the pile length is increased from 3 0 m to 9 0 m the peak epwpr at position p1 p2 p3 and p4 will increase by 32 9 41 0 34 4 and 47 9 respectively as the pile length increases the peak value of the epwpr increases this is because the overall binding force of the soil on the pile increases when the pile length increases correspondingly the force of the pile on the soil also increases which increases the vibration intensity of the soil for the conditions with pile lengths of 8 0 m and 9 0 m the epwpr basically reaches 0 8 which can be considered that the soil is basically liquefied for the conditions with pile lengths of 3 0 m 5 0 m and 6 0 m the epwpr is basically reached 0 8 at smaller depth p1 p2 and p3 except for the larger depth p4 in order to compare the acceleration response of coral sand after the initial liquefaction occurs after 2 s fig 13 shows the acceleration amplification factor after 2 s in different pile lengths as the depth decreases the acceleration amplification factor decreases which corresponds to the variation of the epwpr as the pile length increases the soil acceleration amplification factor decreases the settlement contours of the coral sand foundation with different pile lengths are shown in fig 14 as the pile length increases the gravity load of the superstructure is transmitted to the deeper coral sand foundation through the pile foundation the increase of the pile length under earthquakes will make the settlement of the coral sand foundation more uniform as the pile length increases the settlement of the shallow layers of the coral sand foundation decreases and the settlement of the deep layers increases under earthquakess 5 1 2 seismic response of superstructure the settlement time histories of the superstructure with different pile lengths are shown in fig 15 compared with the pile length of 3 0 m the final settlement of the superstructure in the pile length of 5 0 m 9 0 m is reduced by 47 1 58 8 70 3 and 88 0 respectively increasing the pile length can significantly reduce the final settlement of the superstructure at the time of 4 s the settlements of the pile lengths from 3 m to 9 m are 17 83 mm 10 77 mm 8 51 mm 4 81 mm and 2 87 mm respectively increasing the pile length can also significantly reduce the superstructure settlement rate this is because although the increase in pile length promotes soil liquefaction to a certain extent the increase in pile side resistance caused by the increase in pile length plays a major role in the settlement rate and final settlement of the superstructure the variation of the peak bending moment of the superstructure column with height is shown in fig 16 the peak moment of the column is the largest at the bottom of the column the variation of the peak moment of the column with height in different pile length conditions is basically the same as the pile length increases the peak moment of the superstructure column increases 5 1 3 seismic response of pile fig 17 represents the variation of the peak bending moment of the corner piles side piles and center piles with the depth for the convenience of comparison the ordinate in the figure represents the depth z divided by the pile length l the minimum peak moment of the pile appears near the free pile end and the maximum peak moment appears at the position of the pile head the peak pile moment increases with the increase of the pile length this is because the interaction between the pile and the soil increases during earthquakes with the increase of pile length 5 2 effect of the relative density of coral sand the dry density and porosity of coral sand foundation are calculated according to the relative density the maximum and minimum dry density of coral sand foundation measured in the shaking table test wu et al 2020a based on the previous studies on the coral sand shear modulus friction angle and finn model parameters under various relative densities lv et al 2019 salem et al 2013 wang et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 the calculation parameters of the coral sand foundations with different densities are obtained as shown in table 1 it should be noted that in order to separately study the influence of the relative density on the seismic response characteristics of the coral sand site the permeability of the coral sand is kept constant in this section liu et al 2020 5 2 1 seismic response of coral sand the time histories of epwpr for different coral sand relative densities are shown in fig 18 with the increase of relative density the peak epwpr of the coral sand decreases for p1 position when the coral sand relative density increases from 32 to 82 the peak epwpr decreases from 1 26 to 0 49 with a decrease of 61 2 for p4 position the peak epwpr decreases from 0 84 to 0 38 with a decrease of 54 6 the development rate of the epwpr decreases with the increase of relative density for p1 position when the relative density increases from 32 to 82 the peak epwpr at 1 s is 0 58 0 54 0 53 0 42 0 35 and 0 34 in sequence increasing the relative density of coral sand can reduce the development of the epwpr and thus reduce the peak epwpr 5 2 2 seismic response of superstructure fig 19 represents the settlement time histories of the superstructure under different relative densities the superstructure settles in a nearly linear manner over time as the relative density increases the settlement rate of the superstructure over time decreases when the vibration ends the final settlement of the superstructure decreases with the increase of relative density when the relative density increases from 32 to 82 the final settlement of the superstructure decreases from 12 71 mm to 6 36 mm with a decrease of 50 0 increasing the relative density of coral sand foundation can effectively reduce the settlement rate and final settlement of the superstructure 5 2 3 seismic response of pile the variations of the peak moment of the corner piles side piles and center piles with depth are shown in fig 20 the maximum peak pile moments along depth appears at the pile head and the minimum value appears near the free pile end the corner pile has the largest moment followed by the side piles and the center pile has the smallest moment with the increase of the relative density the peak moment of the pile increases which is related to the larger acceleration response of the soil caused by the increase of relative density 5 3 effect of coral sand permeability the dredging projects of coral sand will cause large differences in the particle distribution in the coral sand foundation which makes the permeability of the coral sand foundation obtained by different engineering methods different liu et al 2020 the permeability coefficient of the coral sand foundation in the shaking table test is set as k 0 and the permeability coefficients are selected as k 0 10 k 0 5 k 0 5k 0 10k 0 and 20k 0 to discuss the permeability on the dynamic response of coral sand pile superstructure under earthquakes in this numerical simulation 5 3 1 seismic response of coral sand the time histories of the epwpr of different sand permeabilities are represented in fig 21 the development mode of the epwpr over time is bounded by k 0 when the permeability coefficient is greater than k 0 the epwpr will rapidly decrease with time after reaching the peak value this is because the excess pore pressure cannot continue to increase and then quickly dissipates due to the larger permeability when the epwpr has accumulated to a larger value when the permeability coefficient is less than or equal to k 0 the epwpr will slowly decrease remain stable or continue to increase with time after reaching the peak value the excess pore water pressure of the coral sand can accumulate or slowly dissipate under a smaller permeability coefficient the peak epwpr decreases with the increase of permeability coefficient for p1 position when the permeability coefficient increases from k 0 10 to 20k 0 the peak value of epwpr decreases from 1 40 to 0 75 with a reduction of 46 4 the peak epwpr at p4 decreases from 0 86 to 0 38 with a reduction of 55 8 5 3 2 seismic response of superstructure the settlement time histories of the superstructure under different coral sand permeabilities are shown in fig 22 the final settlement of the superstructure decreases with the increase of permeability when the permeability coefficient increases from k 0 10 to 20k 0 the final superstructure settlement decreases from 10 96 mm to 8 14 mm with a decrease of 25 7 the final settlements in the three conditions where the permeability coefficient is greater than k 0 5k 0 10k 0 and 20k 0 are close and the final settlements in the other three conditions where the permeability coefficient is less than or equal to k 0 k 0 10 k 0 5 and k 0 are also close however comparing the two cases where the permeability coefficient is greater than k 0 and less than or equal to k 0 the final settlement of the superstructure changes greatly this is because as mentioned above the development model of the epwpr is clearly demarcated at the k 0 permeability coefficient when the permeability coefficient is greater than k 0 the epwpr decreases rapidly with time after reaching a larger value the rapid decrease of the epwpr reduces the liquefaction of the sand and the shear strength of the sand is restored therefore the final settlement of the superstructure is reduced when the permeability coefficient is less than or equal to k 0 the epwpr remains basically stable the superstructure continues to settle at a relatively large rate under earthquakes and the final settlement of the superstructure increases 6 conclusions in this study numerical methods are used to explore the seismic response of soil pile superstructure interaction a new hysteresis damping is adopted to capture the particular variation of the shear modulus damping characteristics and energy absorbing of the coral sand during earthquakes the established numerical model is verified by the shaking table test results and then the influence of pile diameter coral sand relative density and coral sand permeability on the seismic response characteristics of the coral sand pile superstructure was discussed some main conclusions can be obtained as follows 1 the 3d numerical model described by the unique physical quantities such as friction angle shear modulus and permeability coefficient can reflect the seismic response characteristics of coral sand pile superstructure including the development of excess pore pressure the transmission of acceleration in the system the settlement of the superstructure the dynamic bending moment and the spectrum response of acceleration of the coral sand pile superstructure system 2 the increase of the pile length will increase the peak epwpr of coral sand as the pile length increases both the superstructure column and pile bending moment increase which is related to the larger interaction between the coral sand and the pile during earthquakes the final superstructure settlement decreases with the increase of pile length 3 increasing the relative density of coral sand can significantly reduce the development of epwpr during earthquakes and reduce the liquefaction of coral sand the final superstructure settlement decreases with the increase of coral sand relative density when the relative density increases from 32 to 82 the final settlement of the superstructure decreases from 12 71 mm to 6 36 mm with a decrease of 50 0 however increasing the relative density will amplify the pile bending moment response 4 the variation of coral sand foundation permeability will affect the development mode of epwpr when the permeability coefficient is greater than k 0 the epwpr of coral sand foundation under earthquakes will rapidly decrease with time after reaching the peak value when the permeability coefficient is less than or equal to k 0 the epwpr slowly decreases or continues to increase with time after reaching the peak value 5 the final superstructure settlement decreases with the increase of coral sand permeability when the permeability coefficient increases from k 0 10 to 20k 0 the final settlement of the superstructure decreases from 10 96 mm to 8 14 mm with a decrease of 25 7 credit authorship contribution statement qi wu data curation

20194,the structures on the coral islands are at risk of earthquakes to study the particular seismic response of coral sand the numerical model of the coral sand pile superstructure system was established using flac3d the hysteresis damping is used to describe the constitutive shear modulus attenuation and hysteresis of coral sand under cyclic stress the results show that although the increasing pile length magnifies the soil dynamic response the superstructure settlement decreases with the increasing pile length increasing the coral sand relative density reduces the development of the excess pore pressure ratio of the soil but it amplifies the pile bending moment keywords numerical simulation coral sand seismic response soil pile superstructure liquefaction 1 introduction coral sand is a special geotechnical material derived from marine organisms which is present in the seaboard and reefs of mexico persian gulf south china sea and australia xiao et al 2018 a large number of coral polyps are calcified and stacked and then undergo various geological processes with the remains of other marine organisms such as seaweeds and shells to form coral sand therefore the main component of coral sand is calcium carbonate with a content of more than 90 and coral sand retains the skeletal structure of corals which leads to its high angularity complex shape fragile fracture and internal pores coral sand and common terrestrial sand such as quartz sand have obvious differences in physical and mechanical properties lv et al 2019 wang et al 2011 in recent years coral sand is mainly used as foundation material for buildings seawalls embankments and airport runways in marine engineering rajesh and choudhury 2016 wang et al 2011 however the dynamic instabilities of coral sand sites due to earthquakes tsunamis and other dynamic actions occur from time to time green et al 2011 olson et al 2011 many scholars have explored the unique seismic liquefaction characteristics of coral sand through dynamic triaxial tests and other methods salem et al 2013 sandoval and pando 2012 however these studies mainly focus on the liquefaction characteristics of coral sand itself there are various structures on the coral sand and the interaction between the coral sand and the structure under earthquake has great influence on the dynamic response of the coral sand site 1 g and centrifuge shaking table tests chen et al 2016 dadfar et al 2016 ferdosi et al 2015a murao et al 2018 nakai et al 2017 su et al 2019 yazdandoust 2017 2018 analytical analyses chatterjee et al 2015 chiou et al 2020 dadfar et al 2016 dai et al 2020 le et al 2020 nakai et al 2017 and numerical simulations ferdosi et al 2015a b hasheminezhad and bahadori 2019 he et al 2020 lim and jeong 2020 zou et al 2020 are important methods to explore the seismic response of soil structure system however these studies mainly focus on the terrigenous sand there are few researches on the coral sand liu et al analyzed the seismic response of the block type gravity quay walls in the coral sand site through the centrifuge test and the finite difference method the effects of input acceleration intensity and frequency sand relative density sand permeability and other factors on the dynamic characteristics of gravity quay walls and backfill foundations are discussed liu et al 2020 wu et al carried out 1 g shaking table tests on the dynamic response of the soil pile superstructure system in the coral sand and found that the increase in the number of piles will amplify the dynamic response of the system and promote the liquefaction of the soil but the final settlement of the superstructure will decrease wu et al 2020a 2020b ding et al measured and analyzed the acceleration displacement and bending moment of the underground structures as well as the acceleration and settlement of coral sand under different groundwater levels ding et al 2021 bao et al established a two dimensional seismic analysis model of the coral reef seawater system under the action of obliquely incident p waves and sv waves bao et al 2020 as a commonly used foundation form pile foundation will be more and more widely used in the construction of coral reefs the seismic response of superstructure supported by the pile foundation in coral sand is worthy of attention in this study based on the fully nonlinear finite difference software flac3d the hysteresis damping is used to describe the particular shear modulus degradation of coral sand foundation under earthquakes and the numerical model of dynamic interaction of coral sand pile superstructure system is established the numerical model is verified through the results of the shaking table model tests on this basis the influence of pile length sand relative density and sand permeability on the seismic response of coral sand pile superstructure system is discussed and analyzed 2 overview of the physical model the physical model test was carried out using the anco shaking table produced by anco company america the shaking table can simulate three dimensional and six degree of freedom seismic vibration a 5 hz sine wave was applied as the vibration excitation and a shear type model box was used to simulate the free horizontal vibration of different layers of soil as shown in fig 1 according to the similarity design plexiglass was used to make the superstructure supported by nine pile foundation the specific process and sensor arrangement of the test can be found in the research of wu et al 2020a 3 numerical model the flac3d is used to simulate the seismic response of coral sand sites considering soil pile structure interaction in view of the limitations of general finite element software for large deformation simulation of sand liquefaction the particles of coral sand will not be broken considering the stress conditions of the numerical calculations in this study due to the small size of the model test the numerical calculation time will be very long when the shaking table test prototype is simulated in order to improve the calculation efficiency the geometric size of the shaking table test is appropriately enlarged 20 times as shown in fig 2 parameters are also converted according to the similarity law 3 1 numerical mesh and boundary conditions as shown in fig 3 the established numerical model has 26 407 solid mesh nodes 22 276 solid elements and 137 structural element nodes in the static calculation phase the bottom of the model is set as a fixed boundary to constrain the normal displacement around the model after the in situ stress balance in the static calculation stage is completed the dynamic analysis stage is started the surrounding boundary conditions are transformed into free field boundary to eliminate the distortion of surface waves on the boundary since the bottom element of the model is soil the dynamic load application in this study needs to convert the acceleration time history into stress time history and then apply it to the bottom of the model the specific conversion relationship is shown in eq 1 and 2 1 σ n 2 ρ c p v n 2 σ s 2 ρ c s v s where σ n and σ s represent the normal and tangential stresses applied to the bottom of the model respectively ρ is the density of the soil c p and c s are the speeds of p wave and s wave respectively and v n and v s are the velocity components in the normal and tangential directions respectively 3 2 soil constitutive model and property parameters a reasonable description of the hysteresis characteristics of soil is important in selecting the constitutive model of soil in the general equivalent linear analysis the massing n times method is used to transform the stress strain path curve backbone curve to describe the soil hysteresis while flac3d uses a completely nonlinear dynamic analysis method to consider the hysteresis of the soil and describes the constitutive relationship of the soil through the damp furthermore in flac3d 5 0 and later versions a hysteresis damping model has been added to the program to more accurately reflect the energy absorbing of the soil in this study a four parameter model is used to describe the particular attenuation of the soil shear modulus in the case of a large shear strain the deformation response of the soil will be overestimated due to excessive deterioration of the modulus which is inconsistent with the actual situation therefore in the numerical simulation of this study the modulus attenuation curve is truncated that is the soil shear modulus no longer continues to decrease with the increase of shear strain but maintains a fixed value when the shear modulus is reduced to a certain value rayhani and el naggar 2008a 2008b zou et al 2019 2020 the constitutive model used in this study is finn model the corresponding command is model finn range group soil it is worth noting that due to the application of the hysteresis damping the shear stress strain relationship of the finn model is not a simple ideal elastic plastic model lópez jiménez et al 2019 mahmoud et al 2020 sun and dias 2019 sun et al 2019 the performance of the constitutive model in simple loading scenarios is shown in fig 4 a due to the superimposed hysteresis damping even if the simple finn constitutive model is used in the calculation the particular shear modulus degradation of the coral sand is simulated in this study as shown in fig 4 b carraro and bortolotto 2015 jafarian et al 2018 liang et al 2020 liu et al 2019 wang 2015 the attenuation curve of the coral sand shear modulus with shear strain in the numerical simulation refers to the results obtained by liang et al 2020 because its conditions including particle gradation and soil stress conditions are most similar to those in the shaking table test simulated the parameters a b x 0 and y 0 in four parameter model are calculated to be 0 9300 0 4019 1 2622 and 0 9848 respectively the pore water pressure accumulation is described using the finn model a volumetric strain control model based on the mohr coulomb model in this numeral calculation the value of c 1 in the byrne method of the finn model is obtained by the empirical method related to the relative density of the soil other calculation parameters of coral sand are determined based on previous test data and experience jafarian et al 2018 yang and sze 2011 the constitutive model porosity shear modulus bulk modulus friction angle permeability coefficient c 1 and c 2 of coral sand are mc 0 55 30 mpa 40 mpa 34 1 72 10 3 cm s 1 0 56 and 0 71 respectively the cohesion of coral sand is taken as 0 the raft and pile are simulated by solid elements which is set as an impervious material and the constitutive model of the raft and pile is elastic the frame structure column and slab are simulated by the structural elements the column adopts beam elements the plate adopts shell elements the columns slabs and rafts are all set as rigid connections and the frame structure applies 5 rayleigh damping to reflect the damping energy dissipation of the material the minimum center frequency of rayleigh damping is determined to be 3 5 hz by referring to the natural frequency of the low order mode shape of the model according to experimental observations the structure does not appear plastic failure during the earthquake so the concrete structural elements is modeled as linear elastic the density elastic modulus and poisson ratio of structure are elastic 2400 kg m 3 30 000 mpa and 0 2 respectively 3 3 soil pile superstructure interface during the seismic liquefaction of sand the sand often has flow deformation at the bottom of the superstructure or on the side of the pile haeri et al 2012 li et al 2018 motamed and towhata 2010 to simulate this situation in actual earthquakes interface elements with no thickness are set at the contact position between the soil and the superstructure and the contact position between the soil and the pile the interface element in flac3d can simulate the gluing bonding slippage and separation between two materials since the soil simulated in this study is sand the interface element is mainly adopted to describe the slippage between the sand and the structure the pile side interface and the pile end interface have different node ids at the intersection point to reflect the different forces on the pile side and pile end according to the sand type simulated and the soil structure slip separation the normal stiffness and shear stiffness of the interface are taken as 2 107 kpa m the cohesion of the interface is taken as 0 the value of the friction angle is the same as that of sand which is 32 4 numerical results and verification the sine wave with a frequency of 5 hz in the shaking table test shown in fig 1 is converted according to the similarity ratio and input into the numerical model to discuss the mesh convergence the computed excess pore water pressure ratio epwpr at p1 and p2 position are shown in fig 5 when the mesh density is doubled for the convenience of analysis the numerical results are unified to the model scale and compared with that in the shaking table test it can be seen that the epwpr results remain approximately the same in addition the final settlement of the superstructure under the original and doubled mesh densities is 10 59 mm and 10 57 mm respectively and the difference is very small thus the mesh is convergent in this numeral calculation the verification of the numerical model is based on the shaking table test that has been performed 4 1 development of excess pore pressure fig 6 represents the comparison of the epwpr in the numerical calculation and the model test the simulation results are basically consistent with the experimental results in terms of the generation and development of epwpr the epwpr gradually increases when the depth decreases numerical simulation can basically reflect the development of excess pore pressure during earthquakes the calculation of the epwpr in the numerical simulation uses the same method as that in the test as shown in eq 3 so the peak epwpr calculated by the numerical simulation may also be greater than 1 0 3 r u u σ v 0 where δu and σ v0 are excess pore pressure and initial effective vertical stress respectively in the calculation of the initial effective vertical stress the additional stress of the superstructure to the soil is considered 4 2 horizontal accelerations the acceleration amplification factors after the initial liquefaction occurs after 2 s are shown in fig 7 the numerical results are basically consistent with the test record on the trend of acceleration with depth as the depth decreases the epwpr increases and the acceleration shear transmission capacity of the sand decreases therefore the acceleration amplification factor gradually decreases when the depth decreases the numerical simulation can basically reflect the transmission law of acceleration in soil during earthquakes 4 3 variation in the settlement the settlement time histories of the superstructure are shown in fig 8 although the final superstructure settlement obtained by the numerical simulation is smaller than that in the test the development trend of the superstructure settlement in the numerical simulation and the test are basically the same during the earthquake the superstructure sinks in a nearly linear manner over time the settlement contour of coral sand foundation at 5 s is shown in fig 9 the settlement variation of the coral sand foundation conforms to the general seismic response 4 4 dynamic bending moment the comparison of the peak bending moment in the numerical simulation and the test is shown in fig 10 the variation of the peak moment of the superstructure column along the height in the numerical simulation is basically the same as that in the test the peak moment of the pile in the numerical simulation along the depth is also basically the same as that in the test and the peak moment takes the maximum value at the top of the pile the peak value of the moment in the numerical calculation and the test is basically the same therefore the numerical simulation can basically reflect the dynamic response of the superstructure column and pile during the earthquake 4 5 spectrum response fig 11 shows the acceleration spectrum at the first layer of the superstructure calculated by the fast fourier transform under 5 damping since the input excitation is a sine wave with a frequency of 5 hz the main frequency of the acceleration spectrum recorded by the test and numerical simulation is both 5 hz compared with the input excitation the acceleration spectrum exhibits high frequency attenuation and low frequency amplification the amplitude of the acceleration spectrum in the test and numerical simulation has basically the same changing trend in each frequency range therefore the numerical model can simulate the propagation and attenuation of the acceleration in the soil pile superstructure system 5 parametric study and discussion based on the verified numerical model of the coral sand pile superstructure system the influence of pile length coral sand relative density and coral sand permeability on the dynamic response of the coral sand site is discussed the similarities and differences of the epwpr acceleration settlement and so on are compared 5 1 effect of pile length 5 1 1 seismic response of coral sand the time histories of the epwpr of the coral sand for different pile lengths are shown in fig 12 the generation and development of the epwpr under different pile lengths are basically the same the epwpr at the p2 p3 and p4 with larger depths first increases and then decreases with time at the position p1 where the depth is small the epwpr first increases and then gradually increases with time when the pile length is increased from 3 0 m to 9 0 m the peak epwpr at position p1 p2 p3 and p4 will increase by 32 9 41 0 34 4 and 47 9 respectively as the pile length increases the peak value of the epwpr increases this is because the overall binding force of the soil on the pile increases when the pile length increases correspondingly the force of the pile on the soil also increases which increases the vibration intensity of the soil for the conditions with pile lengths of 8 0 m and 9 0 m the epwpr basically reaches 0 8 which can be considered that the soil is basically liquefied for the conditions with pile lengths of 3 0 m 5 0 m and 6 0 m the epwpr is basically reached 0 8 at smaller depth p1 p2 and p3 except for the larger depth p4 in order to compare the acceleration response of coral sand after the initial liquefaction occurs after 2 s fig 13 shows the acceleration amplification factor after 2 s in different pile lengths as the depth decreases the acceleration amplification factor decreases which corresponds to the variation of the epwpr as the pile length increases the soil acceleration amplification factor decreases the settlement contours of the coral sand foundation with different pile lengths are shown in fig 14 as the pile length increases the gravity load of the superstructure is transmitted to the deeper coral sand foundation through the pile foundation the increase of the pile length under earthquakes will make the settlement of the coral sand foundation more uniform as the pile length increases the settlement of the shallow layers of the coral sand foundation decreases and the settlement of the deep layers increases under earthquakess 5 1 2 seismic response of superstructure the settlement time histories of the superstructure with different pile lengths are shown in fig 15 compared with the pile length of 3 0 m the final settlement of the superstructure in the pile length of 5 0 m 9 0 m is reduced by 47 1 58 8 70 3 and 88 0 respectively increasing the pile length can significantly reduce the final settlement of the superstructure at the time of 4 s the settlements of the pile lengths from 3 m to 9 m are 17 83 mm 10 77 mm 8 51 mm 4 81 mm and 2 87 mm respectively increasing the pile length can also significantly reduce the superstructure settlement rate this is because although the increase in pile length promotes soil liquefaction to a certain extent the increase in pile side resistance caused by the increase in pile length plays a major role in the settlement rate and final settlement of the superstructure the variation of the peak bending moment of the superstructure column with height is shown in fig 16 the peak moment of the column is the largest at the bottom of the column the variation of the peak moment of the column with height in different pile length conditions is basically the same as the pile length increases the peak moment of the superstructure column increases 5 1 3 seismic response of pile fig 17 represents the variation of the peak bending moment of the corner piles side piles and center piles with the depth for the convenience of comparison the ordinate in the figure represents the depth z divided by the pile length l the minimum peak moment of the pile appears near the free pile end and the maximum peak moment appears at the position of the pile head the peak pile moment increases with the increase of the pile length this is because the interaction between the pile and the soil increases during earthquakes with the increase of pile length 5 2 effect of the relative density of coral sand the dry density and porosity of coral sand foundation are calculated according to the relative density the maximum and minimum dry density of coral sand foundation measured in the shaking table test wu et al 2020a based on the previous studies on the coral sand shear modulus friction angle and finn model parameters under various relative densities lv et al 2019 salem et al 2013 wang et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 the calculation parameters of the coral sand foundations with different densities are obtained as shown in table 1 it should be noted that in order to separately study the influence of the relative density on the seismic response characteristics of the coral sand site the permeability of the coral sand is kept constant in this section liu et al 2020 5 2 1 seismic response of coral sand the time histories of epwpr for different coral sand relative densities are shown in fig 18 with the increase of relative density the peak epwpr of the coral sand decreases for p1 position when the coral sand relative density increases from 32 to 82 the peak epwpr decreases from 1 26 to 0 49 with a decrease of 61 2 for p4 position the peak epwpr decreases from 0 84 to 0 38 with a decrease of 54 6 the development rate of the epwpr decreases with the increase of relative density for p1 position when the relative density increases from 32 to 82 the peak epwpr at 1 s is 0 58 0 54 0 53 0 42 0 35 and 0 34 in sequence increasing the relative density of coral sand can reduce the development of the epwpr and thus reduce the peak epwpr 5 2 2 seismic response of superstructure fig 19 represents the settlement time histories of the superstructure under different relative densities the superstructure settles in a nearly linear manner over time as the relative density increases the settlement rate of the superstructure over time decreases when the vibration ends the final settlement of the superstructure decreases with the increase of relative density when the relative density increases from 32 to 82 the final settlement of the superstructure decreases from 12 71 mm to 6 36 mm with a decrease of 50 0 increasing the relative density of coral sand foundation can effectively reduce the settlement rate and final settlement of the superstructure 5 2 3 seismic response of pile the variations of the peak moment of the corner piles side piles and center piles with depth are shown in fig 20 the maximum peak pile moments along depth appears at the pile head and the minimum value appears near the free pile end the corner pile has the largest moment followed by the side piles and the center pile has the smallest moment with the increase of the relative density the peak moment of the pile increases which is related to the larger acceleration response of the soil caused by the increase of relative density 5 3 effect of coral sand permeability the dredging projects of coral sand will cause large differences in the particle distribution in the coral sand foundation which makes the permeability of the coral sand foundation obtained by different engineering methods different liu et al 2020 the permeability coefficient of the coral sand foundation in the shaking table test is set as k 0 and the permeability coefficients are selected as k 0 10 k 0 5 k 0 5k 0 10k 0 and 20k 0 to discuss the permeability on the dynamic response of coral sand pile superstructure under earthquakes in this numerical simulation 5 3 1 seismic response of coral sand the time histories of the epwpr of different sand permeabilities are represented in fig 21 the development mode of the epwpr over time is bounded by k 0 when the permeability coefficient is greater than k 0 the epwpr will rapidly decrease with time after reaching the peak value this is because the excess pore pressure cannot continue to increase and then quickly dissipates due to the larger permeability when the epwpr has accumulated to a larger value when the permeability coefficient is less than or equal to k 0 the epwpr will slowly decrease remain stable or continue to increase with time after reaching the peak value the excess pore water pressure of the coral sand can accumulate or slowly dissipate under a smaller permeability coefficient the peak epwpr decreases with the increase of permeability coefficient for p1 position when the permeability coefficient increases from k 0 10 to 20k 0 the peak value of epwpr decreases from 1 40 to 0 75 with a reduction of 46 4 the peak epwpr at p4 decreases from 0 86 to 0 38 with a reduction of 55 8 5 3 2 seismic response of superstructure the settlement time histories of the superstructure under different coral sand permeabilities are shown in fig 22 the final settlement of the superstructure decreases with the increase of permeability when the permeability coefficient increases from k 0 10 to 20k 0 the final superstructure settlement decreases from 10 96 mm to 8 14 mm with a decrease of 25 7 the final settlements in the three conditions where the permeability coefficient is greater than k 0 5k 0 10k 0 and 20k 0 are close and the final settlements in the other three conditions where the permeability coefficient is less than or equal to k 0 k 0 10 k 0 5 and k 0 are also close however comparing the two cases where the permeability coefficient is greater than k 0 and less than or equal to k 0 the final settlement of the superstructure changes greatly this is because as mentioned above the development model of the epwpr is clearly demarcated at the k 0 permeability coefficient when the permeability coefficient is greater than k 0 the epwpr decreases rapidly with time after reaching a larger value the rapid decrease of the epwpr reduces the liquefaction of the sand and the shear strength of the sand is restored therefore the final settlement of the superstructure is reduced when the permeability coefficient is less than or equal to k 0 the epwpr remains basically stable the superstructure continues to settle at a relatively large rate under earthquakes and the final settlement of the superstructure increases 6 conclusions in this study numerical methods are used to explore the seismic response of soil pile superstructure interaction a new hysteresis damping is adopted to capture the particular variation of the shear modulus damping characteristics and energy absorbing of the coral sand during earthquakes the established numerical model is verified by the shaking table test results and then the influence of pile diameter coral sand relative density and coral sand permeability on the seismic response characteristics of the coral sand pile superstructure was discussed some main conclusions can be obtained as follows 1 the 3d numerical model described by the unique physical quantities such as friction angle shear modulus and permeability coefficient can reflect the seismic response characteristics of coral sand pile superstructure including the development of excess pore pressure the transmission of acceleration in the system the settlement of the superstructure the dynamic bending moment and the spectrum response of acceleration of the coral sand pile superstructure system 2 the increase of the pile length will increase the peak epwpr of coral sand as the pile length increases both the superstructure column and pile bending moment increase which is related to the larger interaction between the coral sand and the pile during earthquakes the final superstructure settlement decreases with the increase of pile length 3 increasing the relative density of coral sand can significantly reduce the development of epwpr during earthquakes and reduce the liquefaction of coral sand the final superstructure settlement decreases with the increase of coral sand relative density when the relative density increases from 32 to 82 the final settlement of the superstructure decreases from 12 71 mm to 6 36 mm with a decrease of 50 0 however increasing the relative density will amplify the pile bending moment response 4 the variation of coral sand foundation permeability will affect the development mode of epwpr when the permeability coefficient is greater than k 0 the epwpr of coral sand foundation under earthquakes will rapidly decrease with time after reaching the peak value when the permeability coefficient is less than or equal to k 0 the epwpr slowly decreases or continues to increase with time after reaching the peak value 5 the final superstructure settlement decreases with the increase of coral sand permeability when the permeability coefficient increases from k 0 10 to 20k 0 the final settlement of the superstructure decreases from 10 96 mm to 8 14 mm with a decrease of 25 7 credit authorship contribution statement qi wu data curation
