16235,antibiotic resistant bacteria originating from hospitals are ultimately discharged to municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp which may serve as important reservoirs for the spread of antibiotic resistant genes this study traced and quantified the presence of a rare but clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance gene klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenamase kpc and the viable organisms kpco which carried this gene in hospital non hospital wastewater discharges various compartments within a municipal wwtp receiving water and sediment samples high concentration of the gene bla kpc harbored in viable and multispecies kpco was detected in the hospital wastewater and in the forepart stages of the wwtp but was not detected in the final effluent following uv disinfection kpco were not detected in multiple non hospital sources of wastewater discharges tested the treatment train used in the sampled wwtp was found to help remove and reduce kpco load using whole genome sequencing a kpc producing klebsiella oxytoca strain identical to strains seen in the patients and hospital environment was isolated from the downstream receiving water on one sampling event kpco were also found to persist in the biosolids throughout the wwtp but were not detected in the processed compost products made from wwtp biosolids this study systematically demonstrates dissemination of kpco from hospital point source to environment via municipal wwtp understanding hospitals as the origin and source of spread of some of the most clinically urgent antimicrobial resistant organisms may help

for disease control and the world health organization as one of the largest challenges facing human health cdc 2019 who 2014 understanding the origins and limiting the sources of antimicrobial resistance in the environment will be central to addressing this problem iacg 2019 hospitals and wastewater treatment facilities have been recognized as interconnected nodes where interventions could be useful carbapenems are highly effective antibiotics used to treat severe bacterial infections and they are often considered the last line antimicrobial against enterobacterales a study in the european union found that the estimated burden of antibiotic resistant infections is equivalent to the cumulative burden of influenza tuberculosis and hiv with the main contributors being beta lactamase and carbapenemase producing bacteria cassini et al 2019 the global emergence of carbapenemase genes in enterobacterales really began in the early 2000s in new york with the spread of a klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase but has since evolved with several types of carbapenemase genes observed in most countries around the world van duin and doi 2017 yigit et al 2001 since then aggressive public health and hospital infection control interventions have been put in place to minimize risk of their dissemination into the community cdc 2019 schwaber et al 2011 almost all carbapenemase genes are carried on plasmids which can be shared by different species of bacteria via horizontal gene transfer bonomo et al 2018 the most problematic carbapenemase gene in the united states has been klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase bla kpc which despite the name has been seen in many bacterial species besides k pneumoniae mathers et al 2011 however human infections with kpco are still primarily associated with healthcare exposure in the united states and not thought to be widely circulating in the community although this will likely not be the case indefinitely the slower spillover in the us is thought to be in part due to robust wastewater treatment in contrast to countries where carbapenemase producing organisms are seen in the community mathers et al 2020 walsh et al 2011 enterobacterales are important vehicles of antimicrobial resistance genes arg because they cause human infections thrive in both environmental conditions and the human gut and carry some of the most consequential genes of antimicrobial resistance including carbapenemase genes carbapenemase producing enterobacterales cpe have been identified outside of clinical settings from various environment settings such as river waters caltagirone et al 2017 jelić et al 2019 kittinger et al 2016 oliveira et al 2014 poirel et al 2012 yang et al 2017 river sediments piedra carrasco et al 2017 xu et al 2018 lakes nascimento et al 2017 well waters caltagirone et al 2017 sun et al 2017 and coastal waters montezzi et al 2015 the source of these organisms is not always clear wastewater treatment plants wwtp may be a location for intervention or amplification of antibiotic resistance rizzo et al 2013 potentially followed by dissemination of carbapenemase producing enterobacterales into the natural environment environmental reservoirs of highly antimicrobial resistant organisms pose risks to human health insofar as exposure to contaminated sources may result in difficult to treat infections with increased mortality cdc 2019 iacg 2019 poor outcomes are especially likely to occur following infection with carbapenem resistant enterobacterales compared to other more susceptible isolates cassini et al 2019 patel et al 2008 fortunately in the united states the incidence of carbapenemase producing bacteria has been on the decline cdc 2019 and they are not believed to be widely circulating in the community this makes bla kpc and kpco useful for evaluating the fate and transport of antimicrobial resistance genes and the organisms that carry them from hospital discharge through to wastewater treatment and from there potentially into the environment via receiving waters kehl et al 2021 picão et al 2013 proia et al 2018 in this study we use bla kpc as a model arg to understand the influence of hospital discharges and evaluate the real world efficacy of a u s wastewater treatment system in elimination of clinically significant args into the environment several studies have reported the prevalence of kpco in downstream water and sediment samples collected from locations around the world e g china italy brazil algeria and europe caltagirone et al 2017 mechai et al 2019 picão et al 2013 proia et al 2018 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a mathys et al conducted a comprehensive study of wwtps in the u s in which they collected effluent and downstream water samples from 50 wwtps across the country fifteen of the sample facilities were positive for cre together yielding 30 varieties of carbapenemase producing bacteria mathys et al 2019 somewhat surprisingly none of the isolates were from wwtps on the east coast even though kpco was known to originate in the southeastern u s yigit et al 2001 previous works have demonstrated that wastewater constituents viz antimicrobials can provide selective pressure and promote lateral gene transfer and acquisition of β lactam genes and other args during sewage conveyance and treatment rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 yao et al 2021 conventional wastewater treatments are not specifically designed to remove args widely used disinfection treatments e g chlorination ultraviolet radiation ozonation are efficient at inactivating bacteria but it is not well understood how antibiotic resistance influences susceptibility to these treatments nevertheless there is evidence that these treatments do not achieve complete deactivation of args mckinney and pruden 2012 munir et al 2011 stange et al 2019 sullivan et al 2017 xi et al 2009 yuan et al 2015 the overarching goal of this study was to investigate the fate and transport of bla kpc and kpco originating from a hospital with a previously demonstrated plumbing kpco colonization mathers et al 2018 and assess the risk of their dissemination into the natural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling wastewater ww samples were collected from sewage discharge points for three different buildings owned and operated by the university of virginia uva 1 the uva hospital building 2 a non residential academic building that is directly adjacent to but not hydraulically connected to the uva hospital and 3 occupied residential buildings dormitories the hospital ww discharge was expected to contain kpco based on a previous investigation documenting its presence in premises plumbing mathers et al 2018 2020 the other buildings had not been previously analyzed for kpco or carbapenemase producing organisms and were included as non hospital ww controls representative of public buildings in charlotttesville in december 2019 a grab sample of hospital ww was collected from a discharge point in july and october 2020 as950 hach loveland co and gls compact teledyne isco lincoln ne autosamplers were used to collect 24 h composite samples drawing 30 ml at 15 min interval composite ww samples from non hospital buildings were similarly collected using the autosamplers hospital and non hospital ww samples were collected into sterile 1 l nalgene containers and transported on ice to the laboratory where they were analyzed within 24 h samples were also collected from the moores creek advanced water resource recovery facility in charlottesville virginia this facility is a municipal wwtp operated by the rivanna water and sewer authority rwsa it serves the city of charlottesville plus some portions of the surrounding albemarle county for a total service population of approximately 143 000 its design flow rate is 15 million gallons per day mgd average daily flow is 8 6 mgd the treatment process consists of equalization basins to normalize flows primary treatment to reduce tss and bod loading advanced secondary treatment via the barden pho process to biologically remove organics and nutrients secondary clarification to remove biomass from secondary aeration solids thickening and anaerobic digestion for pathogen reduction of biosolids tertiary filtration via sand filters to remove residual tss and excess nitrogen and phosphorus and ultraviolet uv disinfection the digested biosolids are dewatered and converted to cake solids for transport to the mcgill composting facility for further processing ww grab samples were collected from various locations across the treatment train including i raw influent ii primary solids iii secondary aeration basin iv digester influent v digester effluent prior to dewatering vi pre disinfection effluent and vii final effluent fig 1 grab samples of receiving water and sediment were collected from five locations upstream of the outfall 151 m 145 m 137 m 130 m 121 m upstream from the discharge point and five locations downstream of the outfall 30 m 37 m 49 m 60 m and 71 m downstream from the discharge point locations were chosen based on limited accessibility to the receiving creek and efforts taken to vary the types of locations chosen to increase the likelihood of recovering kpco sediment samples were collected from the top 5 cm of the sediment layer using a core sampler water and sediment samples were collected into 1 l nalgene containers and transported on ice to the laboratory where they were then analyzed within 24 h wwtp samples were collected five times june 2019 september 2019 december 2019 july 2020 and october 2020 however not all sample types were collected each time table 1 all wwtp samples were collected within 48 72 h time frame of the hospital ww sample collection after realizing from earlier sampling points that the biosolids train could also of interest two samples of commercial compost products were collected from the mcgill composting facility in waverly virginia this facility accepts dewatered biosolids from wwtps across virginia including the sampled wwtp in addition to various biodegradable materials like food waste compostable plastics etc the collected residues are aerobically composted into soil amendments which are often distributed to consumers for home garden and lawn use compost products were class a eq exceptional quality one compost sample was produced from feedstocks including wwtp solids the other was created from feedstocks not including wwtp biosolids both compost samples were collected into 0 5 l nalgene containers and transported on ice to the laboratory where they were analyzed within 24 h 2 2 microbial culture quantitative and enrichment cultures selecting for kpc producing bacteria were performed on each sample for the quantitative culture samples were serially diluted 1 10 in sterile autoclaved di water and immediately plated onto a colorex msupercarba agar northeast laboratories waterville me plates were incubated for 18 24 h at 35 c then pigmented carbapenem resistant enterobacterales and aeromonas sp not naturally resistant to carbapenems and often need to acquire a carbapenemase gene and non pigmented other gram negative bacteria such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia resistant to carbapenems typically by non carbapenemase genes mechanisms colonies were enumerated the average number of colony forming units cfus per ml from replicate plates was deduced for enrichment analysis sample aliquots were added to 4 5 ml of tryptic soy broth tsb along with a 10 µg ertapenem disk for clarified wastewater pre disinfection effluent and final effluent and river water samples 1 l sample was vacuum filtered 0 22 µm pes filters and the filters were placed in 4 5 ml of tryptic soy broth tsb along with a 10 µg ertapenem disk after an overnight incubation at 35 c 10 µl was streaked onto a colorex msupercarba agar northeast laboratories waterville me and incubated for further 24 h at 37 c pigmented isolates were sub cultured onto a sheep s blood agar plate remel lenexa ks and underwent species identification via the vitek2 biomerieux durham nc and carbapenemase gene pcr screening bla kpc bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla vim bla imp mathers et al 2018 2 3 molecular characterization and quantification the initial pcr screening was done on isolated pigmented colonies from the colorex msupercarba agar plates to identify possible resistance genes each isolate colony was resuspended into 100 µl water and boiled for 10 mins as a crude extraction method 2 µl of the boil prep sample was added to 18 µl of pcr master mix containing hotstartaq dna polymerase and pcr buffer qiagen dntps and primers targeting bla kpc bla imp bla vim and bla oxa 48 genes according to a protocol adapted from an earlier study dallenne et al 2010 the bla ndm was targeted using the primers ndm f 5 ggtttggcgatctggttttc 3 ndm r 5 cggaatggctcatcacgatc 3 and cycling parameters of 94 c for 10 min then 35 cycles of 94 c for 40 s 55 c for 40 s 72 c for 1 min and then a final temperature of 72 c for 7 min real time quantitative pcr qpcr based on a standard curve was done to estimate the relative abundance of bla kpc when comparing samples to each other and a 16s rrna gene which represents the general bacterial burden of the sample the standard curve was generated by amplifying bla kpc kpc f 3 ggccgccgtgcaatac 5 kpc r 3 gccgcccaactccttca 5 primers and 16s rrna 16s f 3 gcggtaatacggagggtgc 5 16s r 3 cacatccgacttgacagacc 5 primers genes from a reference klebsiella pneumoniae isolate cav1016 the amplicons were then purified using a qiagen pcr purification kit and quantified via the qubit hs dsdna assay the copy number

generated each wastewater sample underwent qpcr on a bio rad cfx96 thermal cycler for 16s rrna and kpc in triplicate on a 96 well plate along with a positive control reference standards and negative controls the samples for this assay were extracted using the qiagen dneasy powersoil htp 96 kit which included inhibitor removal step the ct values for each sample were averaged and copies per µl of both kpc and 16s rrna was calculated for each sample using the standard curve samples with copy numbers below the limit of detection lod were treated as non detectable the standard deviation for each sampling location was calculated across each of the sampling dates for which data was available as the non hospital ww were collected from multiple locations across the sampling time points these were not included in this quantification 2 4 illumina isolate sequencing and comparison of kpco isolates the kpc producing klebsiella oxycota isolates collected in this study along with historical clinical and hospital environment isolates were whole genome sequenced for this a single colony of each isolate was freshly sub cultured onto sheep s blood agar plate from 80 c frozen stock and incubated at 35 c overnight dna was extracted from the bacterial colonies using the quickgene dna tissue s kit autogen holliston ma and checked for optimal quality and quantity qubit 4 fluorimeter thermo fisher scientific the sequencing library preparation was done using the nextera dna flex kit illumina san diego ca according to the manufacturer recommendations paired end sequencing was done using a miseq v2 300 cycle reagent kit illumina on the illumina miseq platform the raw paired end reads for each isolate were quality filtered to remove illumina adapter sequences and trim low quality tail ends using trimgalore krueger 2015 species confirmation as well as identification of closest reference strain was performed directly on the high quality read sets by calculating genomic distances against a curated bacterial whole genome reference database prepared from ncbi s refseq genomes accessed 10 2020 using mash ondov et al 2016 the phylogenetic relatedness analysis was performed using the snippy pipeline seemann 2015 the reads were aligned to the reference strain genome using bwa mem li 2013 followed by single nucleotide variant snv detection using a bayesian haplotype based variant detector freebayes garrison and marth 2012 a maximum likelihood phylogeny was generated using iq tree nguyen et al 2015 with a general time reversible substitution model ascertainment bias correction gtr asc and ultrafast bootstrapping of 1000 replicates followed by joint ancestral state reconstruction pupko et al 2000 pairwise snv comparison was performed at the whole genome level using multiple sequence alignment and a snv distance matrix generated isolates within 100 snvs at the whole genome level were considered to be genomically related 3 results 3 1 detection and enumeration of kpc positive enterobacterales from wastewater table 1 summarizes locations sampled by date for the hospital wwtp facility and receiving water locations upstream and downstream from the outfall kpco were routinely detected in hospital wastewater but never detected in the non hospital wastewaters multiple locations kpco were also consistently present in the forepart stages of the wwtp treatment train namely raw influent primary solids secondary aeration basin digester influent collecting primary and secondary solids and digester effluent kpco were above detectable limits in every sample collected from each of these locations in contrast kpco were detected in 1 out of 3 samples of the pre disinfection effluent clarified water inflow prior to uv disinfection and kpco were never detected in the final effluent post disinfection though kpco were routinely present in the digester effluent which is subsequently dewatered to produce biosolids that are then shipped offsite to a commercial composting facility no kpco were recovered from the final compost product class a biosolids in a one time sampling a variety of kpco species n 15 were detected at various locations and sampling events fig 2 bla kpc carrying citrobacter freundii enterobacter cloacae cx klebsiella pneumoniae klebsiella oxytoca and raoultella planticola were detected in hospital wastewater and wwtp on more than two occasions most of the kpco species detected in the wwtp were also detected in the hospital effluent all bla kpc detected were only in the enterobacterales and aeromonas sp enterobacterales and aeromonas sp not producing bla kpc or other carbapenemase genes ndm vim imp and oxa 48 were also frequently detected in samples from hospital wastewater and the wwtp fig 2 white circles no bla kpc or other carbapenemase genes were detected in escherichia coli or in any non lactose fermenting isolates viz chromobacterium violaceum chryseobacterium gluem pseudomonas aeruginosa in this study aeromonas bla kpc were only detected in samples from the wwtp namely the raw influent secondary aeration basin digester influent and digester effluent within the wwtp the raw influent and secondary aeration basin were found to harbor relatively higher kpco species diversity followed by digester influent in contrast kpco were never detected in the non hospital control wastewater or the final wwtp effluent this held true across all sampling events kpco were also not detected at any of the receiving water or sediment samples from upstream of the effluent discharge point an isolate of k oxytoca bla kpc was detected in enriched culture from a downstream water sample 37 m from discharge point collected in sep 2019 carbapenamase negative aeromonas were also detected in receiving water and sediment samples comparing the abundance of cre from quantitative cultures fig 3 hospital ww was found to have at least a log fold higher abundance than raw influent a decreasing trend of the cre abundance across the treatment train of the wwtp was clearly evident 1 log reduction in cre abundance was recorded in clarifiers and about 2 log reduction after the digestion step cre were not observed in quantification culture plates from pre disinfection and final effluent samples abundance of total gram negative bacterial population lactose fermenting lf and non lactose fermenting nlf in hospital wastewater non hospital wastewater and samples from wwtp prior to disinfection step were comparable fig s1 relatively lower gram negative bacterial population was recorded in pre disinfection effluent receiving water and sediment samples no growth of gram negative bacteria was recorded in the final effluent on all sampling events 3 2 quantitative prevalence of blakpc and 16s rna gene abundances from qpcr the relative abundance of bla kpc copies 16s rrna was found to be highest in hospital wastewater 1 83 copies 16s rrna among all the samples tested fig 4 within the wwtp the secondary aeration basin recorded highest relative abundance of bla kpc 1 25 copies 16s rrna followed by raw influent 0 04 digester influent 0 01 and digester effluent 0 01 bla kpc was not detected for quantification in any of the non hospital ww pre disinfection final effluent in wwtp the receiving waters and sediments and compost samples 3 3 genomic relatedness of the k oxytoca isolates the unexpected detection of a bla kpc carrying k oxytoca in the downstream water prompted further examination to assess relatedness compared to k oxytoca isolates from various wwtp compartments n 8 hospital wastewater n 4 historical isolates from hospital environment n 16 and clinical isolates from patients n 4 kpc producing k oxytoca historical isolates from patients and hospital wastewater plumbing are described in earlier studies mathers et al 2009 2018 2020 sheppard et al 2016 clustering of isolates from hospital wastewater cav8609 cav8608 cav8588 and hospital environment cav3015 cav6597 cav2694 was clearly evident fig 5 similar clonality was found between the isolates from wwtp raw influent sampled in jun 2019 cav8404 and sink drain from a patient room in the hospital from 2017 cav6364 hospital wastewater cav8579 and wwtp primary solids cav8794 k oxytoca clinical isolates from patients historically sampled between 2010 and 2015 cav1374 cav1755 cavp131 and cavp264 were clonal matches to isolates from hospital environment cav3083 cav3248 cav3258 cav6574 cav6582 wwtp digested influent cav8586 and downstream receiving water cav8493 with snp distance less than 100 supplemental table this genomic level similarity demonstrates the link from patients to the hospital environment then to wwtp and subsequently to the environment 4 discussion using bla kpc as a model to track dissemination of antimicrobial resistance from a hospital through a community sewage collection and treatment system our work demonstrates compelling evidence that kpco are perpetually shed from hospital via wastewater and end up in the wwtp high numbers and species diversity of kpco were detectable throughout most of the liquid and solid treatment trains of the municipal wwtp ultimately we found that current treatment strategies employed by the sampled plant largely eliminated both kpco and bla kpc but there is presumptive evidence of periodic spillover based on the single isolate found downstream of the wwtp which was a genomic match to patient and hospital isolates hospital wastewater is a major unified source of antimicrobials arbs and args into the environment yao et al 2021 to reduce dissemination of these elements research to improve the knowledge on the dynamics of their release and the impact various determinants can have on their transmission and persistence is essential the current study along with similar reports confirms the contribution of clinically meaningful and unique antimicrobial resistance genes harbored by viable organisms from a hospital via wastewater discharge hassoun kheir et al 2020 hrenovic et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b the fact that kpco discharged via hospital wastewater amass at the municipal wastewater treatment facility downstream has multiple implications while wwtps may have the potential to eliminate kpco from treated effluents their convergence transforms wwtp as reservoirs of kpco and bla kpc that can promote gene exchange and emergence of superbugs the hospital ww harbored the highest diversity of unique kpco species n 8 tied with the wwtp raw influent and secondary aeration basin fig 2 with c freundii e cloacae k oxytoca k pneumonia and r planticola all being present on multiple sampling dates in comparison there were no kpco or other carbapenemase producing organisms found in any of the non hospital ww samples tested in the study indicative that the hospital ww is most likely the primary source of kpco into the wwtp this observation is further supported by the abundance of bla kpc which was at least a log fold higher in the hospital effluent than in any of the wwtp compartments this contrasts the finding from a comparable analysis in china where the bla ndm gene was seemingly amplified by the wastewater treatment luo et al 2014 furthermore we have little evidence of horizontal gene transfer into new organisms outside of the clinical setting as similar bla kpc harboring species including aeromonas sp have been described in this report which were identified throughout the treatment train and previously in the wastewater plumbing mathers et al 2018 this may be driven by the type of mobile genetic elements e g plasmid host range that the different carbapenemase genes are harbored on and the propensity of each to undergo horizontal gene transfer into specific species bello lópez et al 2019 del castillo et al 2013 there was high level of diversity and abundance of kpco species in the hospital ww fig 3 and fig 4 respectively we speculate this may be driven by antimicrobials present in the hospital wastewater that create massive selection pressure and enrich for these bacteria rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 yao et al 2021 relative abundance of bla kpc in hospital wastewater 1 83 copies 16s rrna indicates the impressive magnitude at which args are shed similar findings were reported in recent studies proia et al 2018 yao et al 2021 one of the limitations of this study is the exclusion of biological replicates for the sample collection and the dna extraction of samples however thorough mixing of all the samples prior to the processing was ensured further all the samples were processed within 24 48 h from the collection time another limitation is the scope of sampling events which were restricted because of the covid 19 pandemic ideally the compost samples would have been collected and analyzed at additional sampling points kpco were present throughout the various compartments of the wwtp with the notable exception of the final effluent and on some sampling dates the pre disinfection effluent raw influent always tested positive for kpco and on all sampling events more than one species of kpco were detected this suggests there was continuous inflow of kpco entering the treatment facility traceable signature of kpco species was observed to move through the treatment chain of separated solids fig 2 this highlights the importance of ww and perhaps biosolids in the distribution and or emergence of resistance kpco in ww have greater opportunities for exposures to several antimicrobials and mutagens in ww increasing the threat of their selection as well as progression to higher trend of antibiotic resistance rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 yao et al 2021 there was interesting variety among resistant species within the wwtp but this can be attributable to different microbial processes happening in each stage of the plant different flows coming together throughout the plant and the fact that samples were all taken at approximately the same time despite long retention times for some of steps of the treatment processes for the investigated wwtp at a flow of 9 5 mgd retention times are approximately 5 h for primary clarifiers 10 h for aeration basins with ras flow 10 h for secondary clarifiers and 12 15 days for the anaerobic digesters these long retention times mean that incoming raw wastewater and outgoing treated effluent collected on the same day do not directly match or correspond to each other with each other kpco were not always detected in the pre disinfection effluent in the 5 sampling events over the 15 months which makes it challenging to know how large a role the final disinfection step plays compared to preceding treatments however the fact that kpco were only intermittently present in the pre disinfection effluent together with the measured high quantities of kpco in the biosolids flowing to the anaerobic digester suggests that a substantial fraction of the wwtp s overall kpco removal occurs during secondary clarification i e sedimentation of the biosolids via gravity the moores creek facility also uses a post clarification slow sand filtration step to further reduce residual biomass concentrations in the secondary effluent the net result is a pre disinfection effluent that typically has very low bacteria concentrations including kpco fig 3 and fig s1 however settling efficiency can vary substantially over time which likely accounts for the fact that kpco were sometimes present and sometimes absent in the pre disinfection effluent it is therefore valuable to have disinfection in place as an additional back up treatment as is evident from the fact that kpco were never observed in the final effluent even when they were present in the pre disinfection effluent figs 2 and 3 it is perhaps significant that the moores creek facility makes use of uv based disinfection after having switched from chlorination in 2012 previous research has documented the high effectiveness of uv based disinfection against carbapenemase producing bacteria compared to other conventional disinfection technologies resulting in their lower prevalence in final wwtp effluents i e 12 for uv versus 42 for chlorination mathys et al 2019 however existing bench and field scale comparisons among various wastewater disinfection techniques have yielded widely variable results munir et al 2011 stange et al 2019 sullivan et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 this variability is perhaps consistent with isolation of a k oxytoca bla kpc strain from the downstream river water during one sampling event when the final effluent did not contain kpco overall the findings of this study suggest that the studied wwtp routinely achieves very good but not perfect removal of kpco most of the bacteria isolated from the downstream water and corresponding sediments samples were aeromonas sp which was also found to be present in the upstream samples none of these aeromonas sp from receiving waters were positive for any common carbapenemases including bla kpc aeromonas sp bla kpc were found in both patients and wastewater plumbing in our hospital mathers et al 2018 2020 however of high concern was a k oxytoca bla kpc fig 5 cav8493 isolate recovered from the receiving water 37 m downstream from the effluent discharge point in september 2019 although not detected in either the upstream flow or the wwtp s final effluent that day a clonal isolate cav8586 was detected in the digester influent and in hospital wastewater hospital sink drain toilets and in patients from earlier sampling events fig 5 k oxytoca is a clinically relevant species it has been found to persist in hospital environmental lowe et al 2012 mathers et al 2018 but rarely described in natural environments contexts these findings suggests the possible spread through the wwtp effluent despite kpco never having been detected in the final effluent it is also worth noting that september 2019 is the only sampling date that kpco were detected in the pre disinfection effluent indicative that kpco were present up until the very final treatment stage of disinfection kpco may persist in the receiving environment and accelerate carbapenem resistance in the environment posing serious human health risks as a potential reservoir for community contracted infections it may be speculated that kpco are potentially stable in the environment and maintaining bla kpc is a low fitness cost as it has been shown that having bla kpc does not significantly impact bacterial growth gao et al 2020 it is also likely that this and other organisms infrequently escape the wastewater treatment but if the pressure is constant and high burden as seen in hospital ww then even the most effective wwtp may fail to prevent wider environmental propagation because removal of kpco from the liquid effluent seems to occur in large part prior to the disinfection process it is of interest to track the fate of kpco through the sequence of steps making up the biosolids treatment train viable kpco and bla kpc were present in all collected samples of pre digester influent including aeromonas hydrophilia c freundii e cloacae k oxytoca r planticola and serratia marcescens each of which was present on a single sampling date viable kpco including k oxytoca k pneumoniae c freundii and a hydrophila were also present in at least one of the collected samples of post digestion biosolids but the post digestion biosolids had less diversity of kpco than the pre digester influent these observations suggest that kpco were not always able to survive the anaerobic digestion process which made it valuable to assess whether they could persist in subsequent biosolids processing steps kpco and several pathogens in general are unlikely to survive different treatments when they are applied one after another i e aerobic wastewater treatment anaerobic digestion and commercial composting zhao and liu 2019 because treated wwtp biosolids are sometimes spread on agricultural lands as a soil amendment it was of concern whether viable kpco may potentially be introduced into the food supply no viable kpco were isolated from the finished compost product that was created using wwtp biosolids as a feedstock however this was a single sampling event and additional sampling and further investigation is required to confirm this claim and understand dissemination of args mediated through biosolids 5 conclusions this study found relatively high rates of kpco and bla kpc genes present in hospital wastewater effluent and throughout a wwtp this indicates that hospitals are likely heavy contributors of some of the most consequential genes of antimicrobial resistance with the potential for environmental dissemination it appears that the methods used in the wwtp generally eliminated both the resistance genes and the organisms which carry them however based on the finding of a genomically identical clinical strain in the receiving waters it is likely that the system may be imperfect in eliminating all spillover this result sparks concern for human health as the strain identified k oxytoca has the potential to cause life threatening infections in humans the dissemination of kpco into the environment has the potential to serve as a reservoir for environment acquired infections in humans although kpco were not found to be present in the final effluent and compost product more stringent and regular surveillance is recommended the dissemination of these challenging to manage bacteria originating from the hospitals

16235,antibiotic resistant bacteria originating from hospitals are ultimately discharged to municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp which may serve as important reservoirs for the spread of antibiotic resistant genes this study traced and quantified the presence of a rare but clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance gene klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenamase kpc and the viable organisms kpco which carried this gene in hospital non hospital wastewater discharges various compartments within a municipal wwtp receiving water and sediment samples high concentration of the gene bla kpc harbored in viable and multispecies kpco was detected in the hospital wastewater and in the forepart stages of the wwtp but was not detected in the final effluent following uv disinfection kpco were not detected in multiple non hospital sources of wastewater discharges tested the treatment train used in the sampled wwtp was found to help remove and reduce kpco load using whole genome sequencing a kpc producing klebsiella oxytoca strain identical to strains seen in the patients and hospital environment was isolated from the downstream receiving water on one sampling event kpco were also found to persist in the biosolids throughout the wwtp but were not detected in the processed compost products made from wwtp biosolids this study systematically demonstrates dissemination of kpco

for disease control and the world health organization as one of the largest challenges facing human health cdc 2019 who 2014 understanding the origins and limiting the sources of antimicrobial resistance in the environment will be central to addressing this problem iacg 2019 hospitals and wastewater treatment facilities have been recognized as interconnected nodes where interventions could be useful carbapenems are highly effective antibiotics used to treat severe bacterial infections and they are often considered the last line antimicrobial against enterobacterales a study in the european union found that the estimated burden of antibiotic resistant infections is equivalent to the cumulative burden of influenza tuberculosis and hiv with the main contributors being beta lactamase and carbapenemase producing bacteria cassini et al 2019 the global emergence of carbapenemase genes in enterobacterales really began in the early 2000s in new york with the spread of a klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase but has since evolved with several types of carbapenemase genes observed in most countries around the world van duin and doi 2017 yigit et al 2001 since then aggressive public health and hospital infection control interventions have been put in place to minimize risk of their dissemination into the community cdc 2019 schwaber et al 2011 almost all carbapenemase genes are carried on plasmids which can be shared by different species of bacteria via horizontal gene transfer bonomo et al 2018 the most problematic carbapenemase gene in the united states has been klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase bla kpc which despite the name has been seen in many bacterial species besides k pneumoniae mathers et al 2011 however human infections with kpco are still primarily associated with healthcare exposure in the united states and not thought to be widely circulating in the community although this will likely not be the case indefinitely the slower spillover in the us is thought to be in part due to robust wastewater treatment in contrast to countries where carbapenemase producing organisms are seen in the community mathers et al 2020 walsh et al 2011 enterobacterales are important vehicles of antimicrobial resistance genes arg because they cause human infections thrive in both environmental conditions and the human gut and carry some of the most consequential genes of antimicrobial resistance including carbapenemase genes carbapenemase producing enterobacterales cpe have been identified outside of clinical settings from various environment settings such as river waters caltagirone et al 2017 jelić et al 2019 kittinger et al 2016 oliveira et al 2014 poirel et al 2012 yang et al 2017 river sediments piedra carrasco et al 2017 xu et al 2018 lakes nascimento et al 2017 well waters caltagirone et al 2017 sun et al 2017 and coastal waters montezzi et al 2015 the source of these organisms is not always clear wastewater treatment plants wwtp may be a location for intervention or amplification of antibiotic resistance rizzo et al 2013 potentially followed by dissemination of carbapenemase producing enterobacterales into the natural environment environmental reservoirs of highly antimicrobial resistant organisms pose risks to human health insofar as exposure to contaminated sources may result in difficult to treat infections with increased mortality cdc 2019 iacg 2019 poor outcomes are especially likely to occur following infection with carbapenem resistant enterobacterales compared to other more susceptible isolates cassini et al 2019 patel et al 2008 fortunately in the united states the incidence of carbapenemase producing bacteria has been on the decline cdc 2019 and they are not believed to be widely circulating in the community this makes bla kpc and kpco useful for evaluating the fate and transport of antimicrobial resistance genes and the organisms that carry them from hospital discharge through to wastewater treatment and from there potentially into the environment via receiving waters kehl et al 2021 picão et al 2013 proia et al 2018 in this study we use bla kpc as a model arg to understand the influence of hospital discharges and evaluate the real world efficacy of a u s wastewater treatment system in elimination of clinically significant args into the environment several studies have reported the prevalence of kpco in downstream water and sediment samples collected from locations around the world e g china italy brazil algeria and europe caltagirone et al 2017 mechai et al 2019 picão et al 2013 proia et al 2018 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a mathys et al conducted a comprehensive study of wwtps in the u s in which they collected effluent and downstream water samples from 50 wwtps across the country fifteen of the sample facilities were positive for cre together yielding 30 varieties of carbapenemase producing bacteria mathys et al 2019 somewhat surprisingly none of the isolates were from wwtps on the east coast even though kpco was known to originate in the southeastern u s yigit et al 2001 previous works have demonstrated that wastewater constituents viz antimicrobials can provide selective pressure and promote lateral gene transfer and acquisition of β lactam genes and other args during sewage conveyance and treatment rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 yao et al 2021 conventional wastewater treatments are not specifically designed to remove args widely used disinfection treatments e g chlorination ultraviolet radiation ozonation are efficient at inactivating bacteria but it is not well understood how antibiotic resistance influences susceptibility to these treatments nevertheless there is evidence that these treatments do not achieve complete deactivation of args mckinney and pruden 2012 munir et al 2011 stange et al 2019 sullivan et al 2017 xi et al 2009 yuan et al 2015 the overarching goal of this study was to investigate the fate and transport of bla kpc and kpco originating from a hospital with a previously demonstrated plumbing kpco colonization mathers et al 2018 and assess the risk of their dissemination into the natural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling wastewater ww samples were collected from sewage discharge points for three different buildings owned and operated by the university of virginia uva 1 the uva hospital building 2 a non residential academic building that is directly adjacent to but not hydraulically connected to the uva hospital and 3 occupied residential buildings dormitories the hospital ww discharge was expected to contain kpco based on a previous investigation documenting its presence in premises plumbing mathers et al 2018 2020 the other buildings had not been previously analyzed for kpco or carbapenemase producing organisms and were included as non hospital ww controls representative of public buildings in charlotttesville in december 2019 a grab sample of hospital ww was collected from a discharge point in july and october 2020 as950 hach loveland co and gls compact teledyne isco lincoln ne autosamplers were used to collect 24 h composite samples drawing 30 ml at 15 min interval composite ww samples from non hospital buildings were similarly collected using the autosamplers hospital and non hospital ww samples were collected into sterile 1 l nalgene containers and transported on ice to the laboratory where they were analyzed within 24 h samples were also collected from the moores creek advanced water resource recovery facility in charlottesville virginia this facility is a municipal wwtp operated by the rivanna water and sewer authority rwsa it serves the city of charlottesville plus some portions of the surrounding albemarle county for a total service population of approximately 143 000 its design flow rate is 15 million gallons per day mgd average daily flow is 8 6 mgd the treatment process consists of equalization basins to normalize flows primary treatment to reduce tss and bod loading advanced secondary treatment via the barden pho process to biologically remove organics and nutrients secondary clarification to remove biomass from secondary aeration solids thickening and anaerobic digestion for pathogen reduction of biosolids tertiary filtration via sand filters to remove residual tss and excess nitrogen and phosphorus and ultraviolet uv disinfection the digested biosolids are dewatered and converted to cake solids for transport to the mcgill composting facility for further processing ww grab samples were collected from various locations across the treatment train including i raw influent ii primary solids iii secondary aeration basin iv digester influent v digester effluent prior to dewatering vi pre disinfection effluent and vii final effluent fig 1 grab samples of receiving water and sediment were collected from five locations upstream of the outfall 151 m 145

limited accessibility to the receiving creek and efforts taken to vary the types of locations chosen to increase the likelihood of recovering kpco sediment samples were collected from the top 5 cm of the sediment layer using a core sampler water and sediment samples were collected into 1 l nalgene containers and transported on ice to the laboratory where they were then analyzed within 24 h wwtp samples were collected five times june 2019 september 2019 december 2019 july 2020 and october 2020 however not all sample types were collected each time table 1 all wwtp samples were collected within 48 72 h time frame of the hospital ww sample collection after realizing from earlier sampling points that the biosolids train could also of interest two samples of commercial compost products were collected from the mcgill composting facility in waverly virginia this facility accepts dewatered biosolids from wwtps across virginia including the sampled wwtp in addition to various biodegradable materials like food waste compostable plastics etc the collected residues are aerobically composted into soil amendments which are often distributed to consumers for home garden and lawn use compost products were class a eq exceptional quality one compost sample was produced from feedstocks including wwtp solids the other was created from feedstocks not including wwtp biosolids both compost samples were collected into 0 5 l nalgene containers and transported on ice to the laboratory where they were analyzed within 24 h 2 2 microbial culture quantitative and enrichment cultures selecting for kpc producing bacteria were performed on each sample for the quantitative culture samples were serially diluted 1 10 in sterile autoclaved di water and immediately plated onto a colorex msupercarba agar northeast laboratories waterville me plates were incubated for 18 24 h at 35 c then pigmented carbapenem resistant enterobacterales and aeromonas sp not naturally resistant to carbapenems and often need to acquire a carbapenemase gene and non pigmented other gram negative bacteria such as stenotrophomonas maltophilia resistant to carbapenems typically by non carbapenemase genes mechanisms colonies were enumerated the average number of colony forming units cfus per ml from replicate plates was deduced for enrichment analysis sample aliquots were added to 4 5 ml of tryptic soy broth tsb along with a 10 µg ertapenem disk for clarified wastewater pre disinfection effluent and final effluent and river water samples 1 l sample was vacuum filtered 0 22 µm pes filters and the filters were placed in 4 5 ml of tryptic soy broth tsb along with a 10 µg ertapenem disk after an overnight incubation at 35 c 10 µl was streaked onto a colorex msupercarba agar northeast

vitek2 biomerieux durham nc and carbapenemase gene pcr screening bla kpc bla ndm bla oxa 48 like bla vim bla imp mathers et al 2018 2 3 molecular characterization and quantification the initial pcr screening was done on isolated pigmented colonies from the colorex msupercarba agar plates to identify possible resistance genes each isolate colony was resuspended into 100 µl water and boiled for 10 mins as a crude extraction method 2 µl of the boil prep sample was added to 18 µl of pcr master mix containing hotstartaq dna polymerase and pcr buffer qiagen dntps and primers targeting bla kpc bla imp bla vim and bla oxa 48 genes according to a protocol adapted from an earlier study dallenne et al 2010 the bla ndm was targeted using the primers ndm f 5 ggtttggcgatctggttttc 3 ndm r 5

qpcr based on a standard curve was done to estimate the relative abundance of bla kpc when comparing samples to each other and a 16s rrna gene which represents the general bacterial burden of the sample the standard curve was generated by amplifying bla kpc kpc f 3 ggccgccgtgcaatac 5 kpc r 3 gccgcccaactccttca 5 primers and 16s rrna 16s f 3 gcggtaatacggagggtgc 5 16s r 3 cacatccgacttgacagacc 5 primers genes from a reference klebsiella pneumoniae isolate cav1016 the amplicons were then purified using a qiagen pcr purification kit and quantified via the qubit hs dsdna assay the copy number

generated each wastewater sample underwent qpcr on a bio rad cfx96 thermal cycler for 16s rrna and kpc in triplicate on a 96 well plate along with a positive control reference standards and negative controls the samples for this assay were extracted using the qiagen dneasy powersoil htp 96 kit which included inhibitor removal step the ct values for each sample were averaged and copies per µl of both kpc and 16s rrna was calculated for each sample using the standard curve samples with copy numbers below the limit of detection lod were treated as non detectable the standard deviation for each sampling location was calculated across each of the sampling dates for which data was available as the non hospital ww were collected from multiple locations across the sampling time points these were not included in this quantification 2 4 illumina isolate sequencing and comparison of kpco isolates the kpc producing klebsiella oxycota isolates collected in this study along with historical clinical and hospital environment isolates were whole genome sequenced for this a single colony of each isolate was freshly sub cultured onto sheep s blood agar plate from 80 c frozen stock and incubated at 35

scientific the sequencing library preparation was done using the nextera dna flex kit illumina san diego ca according to the manufacturer recommendations paired end sequencing was done using a miseq v2 300 cycle reagent kit illumina on the illumina miseq platform the raw paired end reads for each isolate were quality filtered to remove illumina adapter sequences and trim low quality tail ends using trimgalore krueger 2015 species confirmation as well as identification of closest reference strain was performed directly on the high quality read sets by calculating genomic distances against a curated bacterial whole genome reference database prepared from ncbi s refseq genomes accessed 10 2020 using mash ondov et al 2016 the phylogenetic relatedness analysis was performed using the snippy pipeline seemann 2015 the reads were aligned to the reference strain genome using bwa mem li 2013 followed by single nucleotide variant snv detection using a bayesian haplotype based variant detector freebayes garrison and marth 2012 a maximum likelihood phylogeny was generated using iq tree nguyen et al 2015 with a general time reversible substitution model ascertainment bias correction gtr asc and ultrafast bootstrapping of 1000 replicates followed by joint ancestral state reconstruction pupko et al 2000 pairwise snv comparison was performed at the whole genome level using multiple sequence alignment and a snv distance matrix generated isolates within 100 snvs at the whole genome level were considered to be genomically related 3 results 3 1 detection and enumeration of kpc positive enterobacterales from wastewater table 1 summarizes locations sampled by date for the hospital wwtp facility and receiving water locations upstream and downstream from the outfall kpco were routinely detected in hospital wastewater but never detected in the non hospital wastewaters multiple locations kpco were also consistently present in the forepart stages of the wwtp treatment train namely raw influent primary solids secondary aeration basin digester influent collecting primary and secondary solids and digester effluent kpco were above detectable limits in every sample collected from each of these locations in contrast kpco were detected in 1 out of 3 samples of the pre disinfection effluent clarified water inflow prior to uv disinfection and kpco were never detected in the final effluent post disinfection though kpco were routinely present in the digester effluent which is subsequently dewatered to produce biosolids that are then shipped offsite to a commercial composting facility no kpco were recovered from the final compost product class a biosolids in a one time sampling a variety of kpco species n 15 were detected at various locations and sampling events fig 2 bla kpc carrying citrobacter freundii enterobacter cloacae cx klebsiella pneumoniae klebsiella oxytoca and raoultella planticola were detected in hospital wastewater and wwtp on more than two occasions most of the kpco species detected in the wwtp were also detected in the hospital effluent all bla kpc detected were only in the enterobacterales and aeromonas sp enterobacterales and aeromonas sp not producing bla kpc or other carbapenemase genes ndm vim imp and oxa 48 were also frequently detected in samples from hospital wastewater and the wwtp fig 2 white circles no bla kpc or other carbapenemase genes were detected in escherichia coli or in any non lactose fermenting isolates viz chromobacterium violaceum chryseobacterium gluem pseudomonas aeruginosa in this study aeromonas bla kpc were only detected in samples from the wwtp namely the raw influent secondary aeration basin digester influent and digester effluent within the wwtp the raw influent and secondary aeration basin were found to harbor relatively higher kpco species diversity followed by digester influent in contrast kpco were never detected in the non hospital control wastewater or the final wwtp effluent this held true across all sampling events kpco were also not detected at any of the receiving water or sediment samples from upstream of the effluent discharge point an isolate of k oxytoca bla kpc was detected in enriched culture from a downstream water sample 37 m from discharge point collected in sep 2019 carbapenamase negative aeromonas were also detected in receiving water and sediment samples comparing the abundance of cre from quantitative cultures fig 3 hospital ww was found to have at least a log fold higher abundance than raw influent a decreasing trend of the cre abundance across the treatment train of the wwtp was clearly evident 1 log reduction in cre abundance was recorded in clarifiers and about 2 log reduction after the digestion step cre were not observed in quantification culture plates from pre disinfection and final effluent samples abundance of total gram negative bacterial population lactose fermenting lf and non lactose fermenting nlf in hospital wastewater non hospital wastewater and samples from wwtp prior to disinfection step were comparable fig s1 relatively lower gram negative bacterial population was recorded in pre disinfection effluent receiving water and sediment samples no growth of gram negative bacteria was recorded in the final effluent on all sampling events 3 2 quantitative prevalence of blakpc and 16s rna gene abundances from qpcr the relative abundance of bla kpc copies 16s rrna was found to be highest in hospital wastewater 1 83 copies 16s rrna among all the samples tested fig 4 within the wwtp the secondary aeration basin recorded highest relative abundance of bla kpc 1 25 copies 16s rrna followed by raw influent 0 04 digester influent 0 01 and digester effluent 0 01 bla kpc was not detected for quantification in any of the non hospital ww pre disinfection final effluent in wwtp the receiving waters and sediments and compost samples 3 3 genomic relatedness of the k oxytoca isolates the unexpected detection of a bla kpc carrying k oxytoca in the downstream water prompted further examination to assess relatedness compared to k oxytoca isolates from various wwtp compartments n 8 hospital wastewater n 4 historical isolates from hospital environment n 16 and clinical isolates from patients n 4 kpc producing k oxytoca historical isolates from patients and hospital wastewater plumbing are described in earlier studies mathers et al 2009 2018 2020 sheppard et al 2016 clustering of isolates from hospital wastewater cav8609 cav8608 cav8588 and hospital environment cav3015 cav6597 cav2694 was clearly evident fig 5 similar clonality was found between the isolates from wwtp raw influent sampled in jun 2019 cav8404 and sink drain from a patient room in the hospital from 2017 cav6364 hospital wastewater cav8579 and wwtp primary solids cav8794 k oxytoca clinical isolates from patients historically sampled between 2010 and 2015 cav1374 cav1755 cavp131 and cavp264 were clonal matches to isolates from hospital environment cav3083 cav3248 cav3258 cav6574 cav6582 wwtp digested influent cav8586 and downstream receiving water cav8493 with snp distance less than 100 supplemental table this genomic level similarity demonstrates the link from patients to the hospital environment then to wwtp and subsequently to the environment 4 discussion using bla kpc as a model to track dissemination of antimicrobial resistance from a hospital through a community sewage collection and treatment system our work demonstrates compelling evidence that kpco are perpetually shed from hospital via wastewater and end up in the wwtp high numbers and species diversity of kpco were detectable throughout most of the liquid and solid treatment trains of the municipal wwtp ultimately we found that current treatment strategies employed by the sampled plant largely eliminated both kpco and bla kpc but there is presumptive evidence of periodic spillover based on the single isolate found downstream of the wwtp which was a genomic match to patient and hospital isolates hospital wastewater is a major unified source of antimicrobials arbs and args into the environment yao et al 2021 to reduce dissemination of these elements research to improve the knowledge on the dynamics of their release and the impact various determinants can have on their transmission and persistence is essential the current study along with similar reports confirms the contribution of clinically meaningful and unique antimicrobial resistance genes harbored by viable organisms from a hospital via wastewater discharge hassoun kheir et al 2020 hrenovic et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b the fact that kpco discharged via hospital wastewater amass at the municipal wastewater treatment facility downstream has multiple implications while wwtps may have the potential to eliminate kpco from treated effluents their convergence transforms wwtp as reservoirs of kpco and bla kpc that can promote gene exchange and emergence of superbugs the hospital ww harbored the highest diversity of unique kpco species n 8 tied with the wwtp raw influent and secondary aeration basin fig 2 with c freundii e cloacae k oxytoca k pneumonia and r planticola all being present on multiple sampling dates in comparison there were no kpco or other carbapenemase producing organisms found in any of the non hospital ww samples tested in the study indicative that the hospital ww is most likely the primary source of kpco into the wwtp this observation is further supported by the abundance of bla kpc which was at least a log fold higher in the hospital effluent than in any of the wwtp compartments this contrasts the finding from a comparable analysis in china where the bla ndm gene was seemingly amplified by the wastewater treatment luo et al 2014 furthermore we have little evidence of horizontal gene transfer into new organisms outside of the clinical setting as similar bla kpc harboring species including aeromonas sp have been described in this report which were identified throughout the treatment train and previously in the wastewater plumbing mathers et al 2018 this may be driven by the type of mobile genetic elements e g plasmid host range that the different carbapenemase genes are harbored on and the propensity of each to undergo horizontal gene transfer into specific species bello lópez et al 2019 del castillo et al 2013 there was high level of diversity and abundance of kpco species in the hospital ww fig 3 and fig 4 respectively we speculate this may be driven by antimicrobials present in the hospital wastewater that create massive selection pressure and enrich for these bacteria rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 yao et al 2021 relative abundance of bla kpc in hospital wastewater 1 83 copies 16s rrna indicates the impressive magnitude at which args are shed similar findings were reported in recent studies proia et al 2018 yao et al 2021 one of the limitations of this study is the exclusion of biological replicates for the sample collection and the dna extraction of samples however thorough mixing of all the samples prior to the processing was ensured further all the samples were processed within 24 48 h from the collection time another limitation is the scope of sampling events which were restricted because of the covid 19 pandemic ideally the compost samples would have been collected and analyzed at additional sampling points kpco were present throughout the various compartments of the wwtp with the notable exception of the final effluent and on some sampling dates the pre disinfection effluent raw influent always tested positive for kpco and on all sampling events more than one species of kpco were detected this suggests there was continuous inflow of kpco entering the treatment facility traceable signature of kpco species was observed to move through the treatment chain of separated solids fig 2 this highlights the importance of ww and perhaps biosolids in the distribution and or emergence of resistance kpco in ww have greater opportunities for exposures to several antimicrobials and mutagens in ww increasing the threat of their selection as well as progression to higher trend of antibiotic resistance rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 yao et al 2021 there was interesting variety among resistant species within the wwtp but this can be attributable to different microbial processes happening in each stage of the plant different flows coming together throughout the plant and the fact that samples were all taken at approximately the same time despite long retention times for some of steps of the treatment processes for the investigated wwtp at a flow of 9 5 mgd retention times are approximately 5 h for primary clarifiers 10 h for aeration basins with ras flow 10 h for secondary clarifiers and 12 15 days for the anaerobic digesters these long retention times mean that incoming raw wastewater and outgoing treated effluent collected on the same day do not directly match or correspond to each other with each other kpco were not always detected in the pre disinfection effluent in the 5 sampling events over the 15 months which makes it challenging to know how large a role the final disinfection step plays compared to preceding treatments however the fact that kpco were only intermittently present in the pre disinfection effluent together with the measured high quantities of kpco in the biosolids flowing to the anaerobic digester suggests that a substantial fraction of the wwtp s overall kpco removal occurs during secondary clarification i e sedimentation of the biosolids via gravity the moores creek facility also uses a post clarification slow sand filtration step to further reduce residual biomass concentrations in the secondary effluent the net result is a pre disinfection effluent that typically has very low bacteria concentrations including kpco fig 3 and fig s1 however settling efficiency can vary substantially over time which likely accounts for the fact that kpco were sometimes present and sometimes absent in the pre disinfection effluent it is therefore valuable to have disinfection in place as an additional back up treatment as is evident from the fact that kpco were never observed in the final effluent even when they were present in the pre disinfection effluent figs 2 and 3 it is perhaps significant that the moores creek facility makes use of uv based disinfection after having switched from chlorination in 2012 previous research has documented the high effectiveness of uv based disinfection against carbapenemase producing bacteria compared to other conventional disinfection technologies resulting in their lower prevalence in final wwtp effluents i e 12 for uv versus 42 for chlorination mathys et al 2019 however existing bench and field scale comparisons among various wastewater disinfection techniques have yielded widely variable results munir et al 2011 stange et al 2019 sullivan et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2017 this variability is perhaps consistent with isolation of a k oxytoca bla kpc strain from the downstream river water during one sampling event when the final effluent did not contain kpco overall the findings of this study suggest that the studied wwtp routinely achieves very good but not perfect removal of kpco most of the bacteria isolated from the downstream water and corresponding sediments samples were aeromonas sp which was also found to be present in the upstream samples none of these aeromonas sp from receiving waters were positive for any common carbapenemases including bla kpc aeromonas sp bla kpc were found in both patients and wastewater plumbing in our hospital mathers et al 2018 2020 however of high concern was a k oxytoca bla kpc fig 5 cav8493 isolate recovered from the receiving water 37 m downstream from the effluent discharge point in september 2019 although not detected in either the upstream flow or the wwtp s final effluent that day a clonal isolate cav8586 was detected in the digester influent and in hospital wastewater hospital sink drain toilets and in patients from earlier sampling events fig 5 k oxytoca is a clinically relevant species it has been found to persist in hospital environmental lowe et al 2012 mathers et al 2018 but rarely described in natural environments contexts these findings suggests the possible spread through the wwtp effluent despite kpco never having been detected in the final effluent it is also worth noting that september 2019 is the only sampling date that kpco were detected in the pre disinfection effluent indicative that kpco were present up until the very final treatment stage of disinfection kpco may persist in the receiving environment and accelerate carbapenem resistance in the environment posing serious human health risks as a potential reservoir for community contracted infections it may be speculated that kpco are potentially stable in the environment and maintaining bla kpc is a low fitness cost as it has been shown that having bla kpc does not significantly impact bacterial growth gao et al 2020 it is also likely that this and other organisms infrequently escape the wastewater treatment but if the pressure is constant and high burden as seen in hospital ww then even the most effective wwtp may fail to prevent wider environmental propagation because removal of kpco from the liquid effluent seems to occur in large part prior to the disinfection process it is of interest to track the fate of kpco through the sequence of steps making up the biosolids treatment train viable kpco and bla kpc were present in all collected samples of pre digester influent including aeromonas hydrophilia c freundii e cloacae k oxytoca r planticola and serratia marcescens each of which was present on a single sampling date viable kpco including k oxytoca k pneumoniae c freundii and a hydrophila were also present in at least one of the collected samples of post digestion biosolids but the post digestion biosolids had less diversity of kpco than the pre digester influent these observations suggest that kpco were not always able to survive the anaerobic digestion process which made it valuable to assess whether they could persist in subsequent biosolids processing steps kpco and several pathogens in general are unlikely to survive different treatments when they are applied one after another i e aerobic wastewater treatment anaerobic digestion and commercial composting zhao and liu 2019 because treated wwtp biosolids are sometimes spread on agricultural lands as a soil amendment it was of concern whether viable kpco may potentially be introduced into the food supply no viable kpco were isolated from the finished compost product that was created using wwtp biosolids as a feedstock however this was a single sampling event and additional sampling and further investigation is required to confirm this claim and understand dissemination of args mediated through biosolids 5 conclusions this study found relatively high rates of kpco and bla kpc genes present in hospital wastewater effluent and throughout a wwtp this indicates that hospitals are likely heavy contributors of some of the most consequential genes of antimicrobial resistance with the potential for environmental dissemination it appears that the methods used in the wwtp generally eliminated both the resistance genes and the organisms which carry them however based on the finding of a genomically identical clinical strain in the receiving waters it is likely that the system may be imperfect in eliminating all spillover this result sparks concern for human health as the strain identified k oxytoca has the potential to cause life threatening infections in humans the dissemination of kpco into the environment has the potential to serve as a reservoir for environment acquired infections in humans although kpco were not found to be present in the final effluent and compost product more stringent and regular surveillance is recommended the dissemination of these challenging to manage bacteria originating from the hospitals into the environment via the wastewater is alarming and demands enforcement of mitigation efforts to decrease the antimicrobial resistance load entering the system from hospitals and to reduce their environmental dissemination measures like on site pre treatment may be necessary data availability the whole genome sequencing data for all isolates in this study are available at ncbi s sequence read

16236,β oxidation is a well known pathway for fatty acid fa degradation however the wide range of feedstocks their intermediates and complex microbial networks involved in anaerobic digestion ad make β oxidation unclear during lipid digestion having a variety of long chain fatty acids lcfas here we demonstrated the detailed metabolic pathway of major bacteria and enzymes responsible for the β oxidation of individual saturated fas c16 0 and c18 0 and unsaturated fas c18 1 and c18 2 c16 0 showed no negative impact on ad the relative enzyme abundance and production of shorter chain fas c16 were steady with continuous biomethane production 739 ml g 1 vs c18 0 and c18 1 demonstrated a significant ad inhibition by contrast c18 2 demonstrated effective degradation and biomethanation these results indicate that β oxidation is directly initiated from saturated c16 0 fas the presence of c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 significantly reduced microbial diversity which recovered in the presence of c16 0 the bacterial genera clostridium sensu stricto 1 syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter were found in high abundance indicating they might be responsible for most lcfa degradation that resulted in biomethane precursors acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were inhibited in the presence of c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 fas conversion of these fas to c16 and shorter chain fas revived the methanogens the level of the initiator enzyme of β oxidation lcfa coa ligase was increased after the conversion of c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 to c16 0 the production of other fas i e c16 leads to a slight improvement in biomethanation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords saturated fatty acids unsaturated fatty acids β oxidation community response biomethanation 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad occurs in a complex and diverse microbiome structure that is primarily affected by substrate type and toxicity ning et al 2018 salama et al 2020 the nature and concentration of long chain fatty acids lcfas can cause toxic effects on microbes mostly by coating the cells and reducing substance transport efficiency via the cell wall salama et al 2019 inhibition of transport efficiency can make β oxidation a major rate limiting step in lcfa digestion lalman and bagley 2002 most of the available literature on lipid waste digestion focused on the enhancement of ad studies have investigated the inhibition of the ad process due to high lipid content with a mixture of lcfas as well as the application of codigestion c n ratio adjustment and use of additives to reduce this inhibition table 1 however the degradation of lcfas and the subsequent microbiome response i e microbial composition enzymes and metabolic pathways have not been investigated together conducting deep and integrated research using individual lcfas considering the aforementioned points is required to understand the major metabolic pathways particularly β oxidation during lipid degradation the β oxidation pathway of lcfas fig s1 is initiated upon their transport through the cellular membrane in the microbial cell via the transport acyl activation mechanism which forms fatty acyl coa houten and wanders 2010 usman et al 2020b the main fa transporters are fa translocase fat cd36 plasma membrane bound tissue specific fa transport protein and fa binding protein fabppm houten and wanders 2010 the conversion of fatty acyl coas to acetyl coa involves a series of four classic enzymatic reactions gilbert barness et al 2017 the saturated fas sfas enter the β oxidation cycle directly whereas the fate of unsaturated fas ufas in β oxidation varies it has been reported that ufas mostly first undergo a process of saturation to be converted to sfas and are then degraded via β oxidation ning et al 2018 sage et al 2008 certain earlier studies have suggested that ufas directly enter the β oxidation pathway and are converted into shorter chain fas lalman and bagley 2000 2001 however most of these studies did not report the detailed degradation pattern and the dynamics of microbial communities under the digestion of either natural lipids or artificial lcfas table 1 to fill such scientific gaps advanced microbiome and metabolome tools must be used to understand the fate of different lcfas β oxidation pathway in ad that can help in the improvement of lipid waste utilization for maximum energy recovery in the present study two different categories of lcfas i e sfas and ufas were used in ad to study their β oxidation biomethanation and microbiome response for sfas palmitic c16 0 and steric c18 0 acids were used as model fatty acids fas whereas oleic 18 1 and linoleic c18 2 acids were used as ufas these fas were selected because of their abundance in nature the degradation patterns of lcfas their intermediates and the enzymes involved were explored to understand the fate of lipid substrates in ad 2 experimental 2 1 inoculum collection and characterization inoculum anaerobic digestion sludge ads for the present study was sampled in the summer season from a domestic biogas plant running on agricultural waste and manure animal and human in youzhong county lanzhou china the ph of ads was noted on site it was then moved to the laboratory ads was characterized to determine its physical and chemical properties as per previously established protocols usman et al 2020a the total solids ts and volatile solids vs of ads were 39 9 and 21 6 g l 1 respectively with a carbon and nitrogen content of 27 21 and 3 07 resulting in a c n ratio of 8 84 table s1 2 2 lcfa digestion and monitoring the fate of lcfas with various saturations via ad was studied in lab reactors 500 ml with 70 working vume each synthetic lcfa 1 v v including sfas c16 0 and c18 0 and ufas c18 1 and c18 2 95 purity purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd was added in separate reactors after the addition of ads inoculum leaving 30 headspace as per our previous study usman et al 2020a an anaerobic environment was provided by flushing the reactors with nitrogen gas ad reactors were incubated at 35 c at 150 rpm reactors without any lcfa addition were run under the same conditions as a control teller bags were used to collect biogas which was measured daily for the first 6 days and on alternate days afterward with a 60 ml syringe the produced gas in all ad groups was analyzed using gas chromatography instrument gc 9700 plus foli instruments china with a thermal conductivity detector and gdx 502 column in brief the inlet oven and detector were set to 150 c 60 c and 120 c

the scod of filtered liquid from ad was measured using a commercial kit usman et al 2020a 2 3 analysis of microbial community microbial diversity under the presence of lcfas was studied via high

rdp classifier http rdp cme msu edu were used for clustering the operational taxonomic units otus with a 97 similarity cutoff and taxonomic analysis α diversity of the samples was evaluated based on otu numbers as well as using simpson shannon and chao 1 diversity indexes for β diversity among the samples principal coordinates analysis pcoa of unweighted unifrac distances through the bray curtis similarity index was used enzyme abundance was conducted by the prediction of metagenome function using picrust2 based on the 16s rrna gene sequencing results during the digestion of different synthetic lcfas following the previously reported protocols on the enzyme abundance prediction in ad douglas et al 2020 liu et al 2021 3 results 3 1 biomethanation of different lcfas the effect of different lcfas was studied on biogas and biomethane production gompertz model r2 0 95 fitted well with the high biomethane production curve in the present study figs s2 3 the ad of inoculum used as the control without lcfa addition resulted in the lowest biomethane production fig s3a owing to insufficient nutrients available to microbes for biomethane generation upon the addition of c16 0 sfa stable biomethane production was observed without apparent lag phase and produced the most biogas and biomethane 739 ml g 1 vs fig s3b however the other sfa with 18 carbons chain c18 0 presented a different trend in ad the biomethane production in reactors loaded with c18 0 was delayed up to 60 days fig s3c and continued till the end of the study which was 495 ml g 1 vs a similar trend was followed by the monounsaturated fa mufa of 18 carbon fa c18 1 fig s3d in the case of c18 1 the lag phase was prolonged up to 68 days for biomethane production however biomethane production was 586 ml g 1 vs which was higher than that for c18 0 the addition of pufa in ad displayed a different trend compared with sfa and mufa of 18 carbon chains the second highest biomethane production 620 ml g 1 vs with a comparatively shorter lag phase 40 days was observed during the ad of c18 2 fig s3e the highest efficiency 73 was observed for reactors loaded with c16 0 fas reactor followed by c18 2 reactors having 62 efficiency table s3 the ch4 co2 ratio represents the activity of methanogens initially the ch4 co2 ratio was below that indicated for the higher production of co2 fig s3f control and c16 0 reactors showed an increasing trend in ch4 co2 ratio since the start this was followed by c18 2 which had a ch4 co2 ratio 1 after the lag phase caused by an increase in biomethane production by contrast c18 0 and c18 1 showed a ch4 co2 ratio that gradually increased for 60 70 days after which it was also maintained 1 3 2 ß oxidation of sfas and ufas lcfa addition to ad was evaluated to determine the degradation pattern of sfas mufa and pufa fig 1 changes in carbon numbers in sfas showed a different degradation pattern among sfas c16 0 degradation was observed to be direct fig 1a c16 0 fa was degraded to shorter chain fas such as c14 c6 the concentration of c16 0 decreased over time with the increase of these fas however the accumulation of these shorter chain fas was not observed indicating their continuous conversion to c2 c5 fas in contrast to c16 0 the c18 0 degradation trend was different c18 0 concentration did not decrease rapidly in the reactors fig 1b during c18 0 digestion high c16 0 production was observed with a lower ratio of fas that are c16 from the degradation products it can be observed that c18 0 was not directly degraded to shorter chain fas but first converted to c16 0 which accumulated in the reactors along with the remaining c18 0 the produced c16 0 was then converted to other fas a similar trend was observed in mufa degradation where the reactors were loaded with c18 1 it was observed that c18 1 was majorly converted to c18 0 and c16 0 however the concentration of c18 1 decreased rapidly compared with the reactors that were loaded with c18 0 indicating the faster degradation of c18 1 c18 0 and c16 0 fas were accumulated and later converted to shorter chain fas fig 1c degradation on pufa with a similar carbon number was observed to be different compared with its corresponding sfa and mufa c18 2 fa was observed to be degraded at a quicker pace than c18 0 and c18 1 it was also observed that c18 2 was mostly converted to c16 0 first and then to lower carbon chain fas unlike c18 1 which was first converted to c18 0 and then to c16 0 and scfas fig 1d upon lcfa degradation vfa production c2 c5 was observed in the present study fig 2 acetic c2 propionic c3 isobutyric c4 butyric c4 and isovaleric c5 acid production was observed during the degradation of all lcfas with c2 being the major vfa the lack of substrate in control reactors resulted in the lowest vfa production fig 2a consistent and high production of c2 with low c3 c5 content was observed during the degradation of c16 0 in c16 0 reactors along with c2 production its consumption was also consistent and it prevented the accumulation of vfas fig 2b the degradation of c18 0 was observed to decrease with the accumulation of its degradation product c16 0 we also observed decreased production and consistent accumulation of vfas particularly c2 until 40 days fig 2c upon a decrease in c18 0 after 40 days high vfa production was observed until 60 days after which the decrease in c18 0 and their major degradation products such as c16 0 and c2 was recorded similar to c18 0 degradation vfa production was low initially in reactors loaded with c18 1 until 40 days fig 2d a rapid increase in c2 production was observed during 40 70 days followed by a decrease in vfa content due to consumption however during c18 2 digestion a gradual increase and accumulation of vfas particularly c2 was observed till 40 days fig 2e total vfas consumption occurred afterward resulting in decreased vfas at the digestion period end fig s4 3 3 microbiome shifts under different lcfas the microbial diversity of reactors was decreased in the presence of different saturated and unsaturated lcfa types over time total otus in the inoculum was 720 table s4 in control reactors where no lcfas were added otus decreased to 758 and finally decreased to 607 on the 100th day total shared otus in control groups at different times were 291 which were the highest among all other reactors fig s5a in the presence of c16 0 the shared otus among the samples collected at different times decreased to 286 along with a decrease in total otus to 580 at the end fig s5b the introduction of higher sfas such as c18 0 decreased the diversity more compared with c16 0 where shared otus were decreased to 224 and total otus after 100 days were reduced to 509 fig s5c among the ufas 209 shared otus were observed in the reactors loaded with c18 1 with the lowest otus of 471 observed on the 80th day that increased to 507 on the 100th day this was almost the same as those observed in the reactors loaded with c18 0 fig s5d the initial decrease in otus indicates the toxic effect of c18 1 and the recovery of otus toward the end might be because of c18 1 degradation c18 2 showed an opposite trend compared with other reactors otus decreased to 482 on the 20th day and then continuously increased afterward reaching 571 at the end this indicates lower toxicity of c18 2 toward ad microbes shared otus were 217 which were also higher than those of c18 1 fig s5e otus from different reactors were also compared at their corresponding times to observe community dynamics because of changes in the substrate on the 20th day maximum otus were observed in the control reactor 758 whereas the c18 2 reactors showed the lowest otus 482 shared otus on the 20th day were 241 fig s6a the overall community diversity increased on the 40th day with 219 shared otus among all groups however the highest otus 668 on the 40th day were observed in c18 0 reactors fig s6b shared otus decreased to 199 and 172 on days 60 and 80 respectively fig s6c and d at the end of the study shared otus increased to 248 fig s6e decreased otus during the study might be because of the negative impact of lcfas that resulted in a diverse community a significant variation was observed among the overall communities of different reactors however significant variation was not observed when the overall communities of different times were compared fig s7 β diversity among samples collected at different times from reactors loaded with sfas mufa and pufa was studied via pcoa fig 3 these samples from the control and c16 0 reactors were closely related indicating a stable and similar community meanwhile samples from c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 were plotted together and the results showed that they clustered together however they were separate from the control and c16 0 the sample of the 20th day from c18 0 reactors was observed to be a variant from the remaining cluster this result indicates that initially c18 0 had a strong impact on the microbial community the hierarchal clustering of the samples also showed the similarity among the community of digesters utilizing different lcfas with 18 carbons previous studies on lcfas digestion are mainly focused on identifying their impact on ad however the detailed degradation of lcfas and microbial community analysis are not evaluated table 2 the major microbial phyla reported in ad are firmicutes bacteroidota synergistota proteobacteria euryarchaeota and halobacterota kurade et al 2020 l bräuer et al 2020 lyu et al 2018 usman et al 2020a the major phyla observed in the present study were firmicutes 55 94 bacteroidota 0 6 34 synergistota 1 1 5 5 halobacterota 0 42 7 64 and proteobacteria 0 64 3 5 fig 4 most of the minor phyla remained the same or decreased during the current study comparison of the overall community of all reactors indicated a significant variation in firmicutes bacteroidota and proteobacteria along with some minor phyla however no significant difference was observed in communities that were compared on the basis of time fig s8 3 3 1 bacterial community dynamics under different lcfas the degradation of organic components is mostly performed by the bacterial community the first three stages of ad i e hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis are dominated by bacteria in the present study firmicutes bacteroidota synergistota and proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla firmicutes accounted for 82 of the present bacterial composition in the inoculum 0 days in the control reactor the abundance of firmicutes decreased with time and finally reached 59 at the end 100th day however bacteroidota which was 4 7 initially increased to 29 fig s9a a decrease in firmicutes 55 and an increase in bacteroidota 33 were observed during c16 0 digestion up to 60 days afterward bacteroidota decreased to 22 while firmicutes increased to 70 the relative abundance of other major bacterial phyla decreased during c16 0 digestion in the reactors loaded with c18 0 the abundance of synergistota and proteobacteria increased initially along with the increase in bacteroidota firmicutes remained high with no significant increase over time unlike other reactors firmicutes increased in the reactors loaded with c18 1 the phylum bacteroidota was observed in low abundance on the 20th 40th and 80th days however it increased on 60th and 100th days firmicutes increased on the 20th day during c18 2 digestion however they later decreased with the increase in bacteroidota fig s9a it was observed that firmicutes and bacteroidota majorly contribute to lcfa degradation members of firmicutes are resistant to lcfas and have a high degradation potential for lipid waste and fas moreover bacteroidota can degrade lipids under low concentrations usman et al 2020a the abundance of firmicutes was initially high 93 in the presence of high lcfas bacteroidota dominated after the degradation and decrease in lcfa concentration fig s9 the variation in the abundance of the top 50 bacterial genera observed during the present study is shown in figure s10 most of the bacterial genera were decreased by lcfa addition clostridium sensu stricto 1 syntrophomonas enterococcus terrisporobacter fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter were the major bacterial genera with a dynamic abundance in different reactors fig 5 clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the most dominant bacterial genera in all reactors with a relative abundance of 22 85 64 31 in the control its abundance was nearly stable over time in reactors loaded with c16 0 clostridium sensu stricto 1 population decreased in the presence of lcfas with 18 carbons clostridium sensu stricto 1 population increased indicating its ability to tolerate the presence of sfa mufa and pufa syntrophomonas were observed in very low abundance in the inoculum and control groups in the presence of c16 0 the abundance of syntrophomonas continuously increased up to 29 fold the addition of lcfas with 18 carbons decreased syntrophomonas initially however with the degradation of c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 the syntrophomonas increased by 39 fold in c18 0 37 fold in c18 1 and 17 fold in c18 2 digestion fig 5 fastidiosipila showed a little increase in the control and c16 0 reactors in the presence of c18 0 fastidiosipila increased initially up to 9 and reduced again with a decrease in c18 0 concentration an initial drop in the abundance of fastidiosipila was observed in c18 1 and c18 2 reactors however toward the end the abundance of fastidiosipila showed a small increase sedimentibacter increased in the presence of c16 0 as c16 0 was the main degradation product during other lcfa degradation sedimentibacter was decreased initially in the presence of c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 and increased toward the end as most of the lcfas were degraded to c16 0 and lower fas enterococcus and terrisporobacter which were high in the inoculum decreased in all reactors in the present study fig 5 3 3 2 archaeal community dynamics under different lcfas the presence of lcfas affected the archaeal community the major archaea on the order level found in the present study are presented in figure s9b methanomicrobiales and methanosarcinales were the most abundant methanogenic orders in all reactors methanomicrobiales were abundant in the control and c16 0 reactors moreover its abundance was high initially in other reactors but decreased later on in the c18 2 reactors methanomicrobiales increased at the end as most of the lcfas were degraded methanosarcinales on the other hand were abundant in the presence of 18 carbon lcfas most of the archaeal genera were significantly affected by the presence of lcfas at the genus level methanosarcina methanosaeta methanospirillum methanoculleus methanogenium and methanobrevibacter were found in abundance fig 6 methanogenium and methanobrevibacter were both negatively affected by lcfa presence among the methanogenic genera methanosaeta was abundant 35 65 under the presence of high c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 concentrations upon the degradation of these lcfas to c16 0 and other shorter chain fas methanosarcina became dominant up to 103 fold methanosarcina was active in the presence of c16 0 methanospirillum and methanoculleus were inhibited by the presence of all four lcfas upon the degradation of lcfas both methanogens also increased up to 53 and 55 fold respectively as c18 0 degraded at a reduced pace and was converted to c16 0 the abundance of methanospirillum in the reactors loaded with c18 0 was the lowest 1 because of the accumulation of c18 0 and c16 0 3 3 3 picrust analysis for enzymes involved in lcfas conversation to biomethane according to kegg map 00 071 the major enzymes involved in β oxidation and biomethane production are listed in table 3 the enzyme long chain fa coa ligase ec 6 2 1 3 is responsible for the initiation of the β oxidation pathway whereas acetyl coa c acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 9 and acetyl coa c acyltransferase ec 2 3 1 16 finalize the β oxidation pathway to produce acetyl coa and fatty acyl coa with two carbons less than the original fa ec 6 2 1 3 was found to be stable during c16 0 digestion indicating that the metabolic processes were unaffected while ec 6 2 1 3 decreased during the degradation of c18 0 initially the enzyme concentration recovered after 80 days this enzyme was majorly affected by the presence of c18 1 at first the level of ec 6 2 1 3 decreased in c18 2 reactors but it recovered quickly compared with c18 0 and c18 1 the enzymes ec 2 3 1 16 responsible for finalizing β oxidation also presented a similar trend the enzymes acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 and acetyl coa synthetase ec 6 2 1 1 that are responsible for the interconversion of acetate and acetyl coa were higher in the c18 0 and c18 1 reactors fig 7 delay in biomethane production was observed in these reactors which may have led to the interconversion of these two components as high vfas particularly acetate were also observed two pathways of biomethane production acetate to biomethane m00357 and co2 to biomethane m00567 were observed in the present study kegg map 00 680 the acetate based biomethane production is initiated from acetyl coa the enzyme acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase ec 2 3 1 169 converts acetyl coa to 5 methyl tetrahydromethanopterin 5 methyl thm s pt and co carbon monoxide dehydrogenase ferredoxin ec 1 2 7 4 converts co to co2 the co2 to biomethane pathway starts from the conversion of co2 to formylmethanofuran by the enzyme formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase ec1 2 99 5 currently known as ec 1 2 7 12 formylmethanofuran is then converted by a series of enzymes ec 2 3 1 101 3 5 4 27 1 5 98 1 1 12 98 2 and 1 5 98 2 to 5 methyl thm s pt after the formation of 5 methyl thm s pt both the co2 and acetate to biomethane pathways are similar in which 5 methyl thm s pt is converted to methyl com via tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase ec 2 1 1 86 finally coenzyme b sulfoethylthiotransferase ec 2 8 4 1 converts methyl com to biomethane these three enzymes were low in the presence of lcfas and subsequently increased upon the degradation of lcfas the last enzyme ec 2 8 4 1 was lowest in the reactors loaded with c18 1 where delayed biomethane production was observed fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 fate of biomethane under different lcfas lipid addition in ad has been reported to increase the biogas and biomethane production after a prolonged initial phase ning et al 2018 palatsi et al 2009 pereira et al 2005 silva et al 2016 an increase in the lag time for biogas and biomethane generation has been shown to be related to the concentration of fat oil and grease fog martinez et al 2011 usman et al 2020a zonta et al 2013 as fog is a mixture of lcfas with a varying degree of saturation it cannot be determined which lcfas led to prolonged lag phase and inhibition the addition of c16 0 to ad did not affect the biogas biomethane production rate fig s3b the direct degradation of c16 0 to vfas via β oxidation and the continuous production of biomethane represent its nontoxic nature toward ad microbes moreover c16 0 is a white solid at room temperature which gradually disappeared toward the end of the digestion period a similar trend was reported for c16 0 degradation which proceeded without any inhibition and with the disappearance of white particles at the end eftaxias et al 2020 various lcfas have been reported to inhibit biomethane production even at low concentrations mehariya et al 2018 among sfas unlike c16 0 c18 0 has been reported to result in the inhibition of the ad process owing to several reasons angelidaki and ahring 1992 the inhibition from lipidic feedstock and lcfas might be due to the physical attachment of lcfas to microbial cells resulting in the coating of the cells by lipid layers which disturbs the cellular transport palatsi et al 2012 salama et al 2020 an increase in the lag phase during c18 0 digestion can also be attributed to a reduced degradation rate and accumulation of both lcfas and vfas figs 1 2 the addition of c18 1 mufa also delayed biomethane production during monodigestion c18 1 has a similar inhibitory effect as c18 0 toward biomethane production angelidaki and ahring 1992 increasing the concentration of fog with a high content of c18 1 resulted in an increased lag phase during the monodigestion of fog usman et al 2020a such prolonged lag phase and ultimate inhibition during high fog loadings can be attributed to the presence of c18 1 which was also previously reported by pereira et al 2002 a different finding of biomethane inhibition was also reported where ufas c18 1 and c18 2 were shown to have a higher inhibitory effect than c18 0 ning et al 2018 c18 2 showed lower inhibition than c18 0 and c18 1 with a decreased lag phase of 40 days however compared with c16 0 it showed increased inhibition the temporary inhibition of methanogenic activity was reported because of the presence of c18 2 digestion lalman and bagley 2000 the shorter lag phase and limited inhibition of c18 2 can be attributed to its quicker degradation to vfas via β oxidation 4 2 degradation of sfas and ufas lcfa degradation to acetate and other vfas mainly occurs via the β oxidation pathway which was also identified as a major rate limiting factor during the ad of lipid waste lalman and bagley 2002 usman et al 2020b in the present study c16 0 was degraded directly to c2 with the major intermediates c14 0 c12 0 c10 0 c8 0 and c6 0 fas with odd carbon chains were observed in a lower ratio fig 1a being sfa c16 0 directly enters β oxidation where each cycle removes two carbons this justifies fa production with an even carbon chain sousa et al 2009 a study has reported inhibition due to the intermediate of lcfa degradation cavaleiro et al 2016 however such inhibition was not observed in the present study c2 production was also consistent without accumulation which can be attributed to its conversion to biomethane ning et al 2018 c18 0 was degraded at a reduced rate the accumulation of c18 0 and its degradation product c16 0 was observed fig 1 a previous study on the use of synthetic lcfas did not report its detailed degradation pattern only a few studies have identified c16 0 lcfa as a major intermediate in the degradation of lcfas indicating that the β oxidation of lcfas proceeds via c16 0 table 2 an increase in the c16 0 content from its initial concentration was observed during the digestion of mixed c16 c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 ning et al 2018 a similar trend in the current study was observed where c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 fas were first converted to c16 0 c18 0 digestion with enriched culture was reported to be effective in producing vfas and biomethane angelidaki and ahring 1995 c18 1 was not converted directly to c16 0 because the production of c18 0 was observed along with c16 0 the presence of these sfas indicates that c18 1 degradation occurs via c18 0 and then c16 0 which finally converts to shorter chain fas by β oxidation this trend was different from the previously reported study ning et al 2018 moreover c2 production during c18 1 digestion was also initially low indicating the lower activity of ad microbes both β oxidation and methanogenic activity were inhibited during the increased c18 1 presence and c16 0 was observed to accumulate which represented that β oxidation proceeded via c16 0 pereira et al 2002 c18 2 β oxidation was also observed to occur via c16 0 unlike c18 1 c18 2 was mostly converted to c16 0 with relatively lower production of c18 1 and c18 0 among vfas in c18 2 c2 production was major the production was initially low compared with that produced in reactors loaded with c16 0 but were produced earlier than c18 0 and c18 1 figs 1 and 2e the saturation of pufas and mufas to c16 0 might have occurred before β oxidation because c18 0 was not observed as a major by product during ufa c18 1 and c18 2 degradation the presence of small amounts of c17 1 and c16 1 could be owing to the improper saturation of ufas lalman and bagley 2001 the white partial appearance during the degradation of all c18 fas can be attributed to the production of c16 0 as the main degradation intermediate the reduced degradation of c18 0 compared with its ufas particularly c18 2 can be attributed to the toxicity of c18 0 toward the microbial community and its physical state angelidaki and ahring 1992 lalman and bagley 2001 the availability of c18 1 and c18 2 fas to ad microbes would be high because of their nature at room temperature eftaxias et al 2020 the attachment of liquid ufas to microbial cells may lead to an initial inhibition however it would also force the microbial cell to initiate a degradation mechanism to overcome the inhibition vfa c2 c5 production indicated effective degradation during acidogenesis and acetogenesis saha et al 2019 vfa production and consumption during c16 0 digestion indicated rich bacterial and archaeal communities the bacterial community could degrade c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 resulting in initial vfa accumulation this accumulation of vfas might be caused by the lcfa inhibition of the archaeal community koster and cramer 1987 usman et al 2020a 4 3 shift and role of major microbes during lcfas digestion variation in the abundance and diversity of microbial communities is driven by the nature of the substrate used in ad the actively involved microbial phyla reported in ad are firmicutes bacteroidota synergistota proteobacteria euryarchaeota and halobacterota kurade et al 2020 l bräuer et al 2020 lyu et al 2018 usman et al 2020a the difference in environmental factors such as temperature organic loading suspension ph and mixing ratio and feedstock types influences the ad diversity guo et al 2021 saha et al 2020 the addition of lipid substrate in ad has been reported to reduce the otu count compared with the original inoculum ning et al 2018 salama et al 2020 the variation in the microbial samples observed in the pcoa plot fig 3 indicates that the feedstock nature lcfas type is one of the main factors in shaping the microbial community campanaro et al 2018 clostridium sensu stricto a syntrophic acetate oxidizer sao is found in ad to produce precursors for biomethane production charalambous et al 2020 li et al 2018 most of the members from class clostridia are widely reported in ad owing to their waste degradation and fermentation ability moreover the presence of increased clostridia in the current study can be related to the inoculum source that contained manure dohrmann et al 2015 in the reactors loaded with c16 0 clostridium sensu stricto 1 decreased 0 55 fold with the increase in syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter 29 19 and 2 15 fold the steady degradation of c16 0 production of acetate and its conversion to biomethane indicate that syntrophic acetate oxidation was the lowest which led to a higher abundance of syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter studies have reported the role of syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter in lcfa degradation and their symbiotic relationship with acetoclastic methanogenic archaea salama et al 2020 usman et al 2020a ziels et al 2018 these bacteria appear to be more active in the presence of c16 0 because their abundance was low in the initial stages of fas with 18 carbons fig 5 moreover upon the decrease in their concentration and production of c16 and lower fas the abundance of syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter recovered limited bacterial species can degrade straight chain lcfas having more than 12 carbon and most of them belong to the genus syntrophomonas alves et al 2009 liu et al 2021 the results of previous studies and this study indicates that syntrophomonas is a major lcfas degrader the presence of clostridium sensu stricto 1 had the highest abundance in the c18 1 reactor followed by c18 2 and c18 0 lcfas moreover in these reactors the content of acetate was higher fig 2 clostridium is responsible for the conversion of acetate into co2 and h2 karakashev et al 2006 a lower ch4 co2 ratio indicates a higher co2 production and the oxidation of acetate by clostridium sensu stricto 1 in these reactors fig s3f among archaea both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic microbes were observed along with their pathways methanosaeta is an absolute acetoclastic methanogen whereas methanospirillum and methanoculleus are hydrogenotrophic methanogens species of genus methanosarcina can utilize different substrates and produce biomethane via the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways jain et al 2021 kurade et al 2019 maus et al 2012 methanosaeta was initially high 65 in the presence of lcfas which were replaced by methanosarcina methanospirillum and methanoculleus at the end of digestion the resistive nature of methanosaeta toward high concentration and a mixture of lcfas might explain its high abundance initially where other genera were suppressed carr et al 2018 kurade et al 2019 moreover the low acetate concentration initially might explain the high methanosaeta abundance silva et al 2016 a shift in the abundance of methanosaeta toward methanosarcina was observed upon the decrease in fog concentration methanosarcina is sensitive toward lcfas particularly for fas with 18 carbons kurade et al 2019 as observed in the current study methanospirillum and methanoculleus might also be sensitive to lcfa presence being hydrogenotrophic methanogens the abundance of these increased up to 53 and 54 fold respectively when the sao clostridium sensu stricto 1 also increased most of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens exist in symbiotic relationships with sao charalambous et al 2020 li et al 2018 4 4 enzymes abundance variation during lcfas digestion the use of advanced bioinformatics tools such as picrust provides a deep insight into the different functions of various environmental microbiota such as the ad microbiome ijoma et al 2021 the previous studies have reported the presence of different enzymes during the ad of lcfas liu et al 2021 ziels et al 2018 the picrust analysis indicated the variation in abundance of different enzymes involved in β oxidation and biomethanation fig 7 and table 3 the enzymes ec 6 2 1 3 ec 2 3 1 9 and ec 2 3 1 16 involved in β oxidation showed a similar trend with syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter indicating that β oxidation might be led by these bacterial genera it was reported that the β oxidation of fog led by syntrophomonas after calcium addition liu et al 2021 the species of methanosarcina are mostly reported to produce the enzymes that convert the acetate to acetyl coa zhao et al 2020 the enzymes for the acetoclastic pathway were higher in the current study on the other hand the enzymes for the co2 reduction pathway were in relatively lower abundance in presence of c18 fas most of the methanogenic enzymes were observed in low abundance owing to the high presence of methanosarcina up to 85 and the different enzymes observed fig 7 it may have produced biomethane via both the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways habtewold et al 2018 the presence of both types of enzymes that convert acetate and co2 into biomethane and the presence of the above methanogens indicate that the production of biomethane might have occurred via both pathways however the acetoclastic methanogenic pathway appears to be dominant 4 5 practical implication of this study several full scale ad facilities have been established in different regions across the globe salama et al 2019 ziels et al 2018 lipidic waste has been identified to have the highest theoretical biomethane potential and is being used as a substrate in ad hosseini and wahid 2013 however the lcfas in lipidic waste are toxic to the ad microbes beyond a specific concentration as per our previous findings usman et al 2020a fat oil and grease fog has been used as a substrate in the lab and pilot scale reactors as well as in some large scale plants such as douglas l smith middle basin wastewater treatment plants and des moines metropolitan wastewater reclamation facility in the usa kabouris et al 2012 kurade et al 2019 salama et al 2019 the main concern in the used fog is its diverse fas profile with a higher content of c18 fas 56 4 95 78 abomohra et al 2020 due to which the microbial communities are inhibited leading to low digestibility and biomethane production therefore the current study suggests that a model lipidic feedstock should have a higher c16 and or shorter chain fas content moreover the lcfas conversion to short chain fas by application of various pretreatment approaches might also improve the biomethanation at large scale plants this can help in utilizing a high amount of lipidic feedstocks and economic bioenergy production 5 conclusion lcfas have a different effect on anaerobic digestion ad depending on their chain length and saturation degree c16 0 is the main initiator of β oxidation for all other lcfas c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 in the case of ufas with a single double bond c18 1 was saturated to c16 0 majorly and c18 0 slightly however during the degradation of c18 2 two double bonds c18 0 was not observed indicating that it might directly pass via the saturation and chain shortening process simultaneously clostridium sensu stricto 1 syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter are majorly involved in lcfas degradation and have a syntrophic relationship with methanosarcina methanospirillum and methanoculleus after the degradation of fas with 18 carbons these methanogens initiated biomethanation this study demonstrated that the conversion of lcfas in the lipid substrate to c16 0 would help avoid inhibition and delay in biomethane production which would help in the utilization

16236,β oxidation is a well known pathway for fatty acid fa degradation however the wide range of feedstocks their intermediates and complex microbial networks involved in anaerobic digestion ad make β oxidation unclear during lipid digestion having a variety of long chain fatty acids lcfas here we demonstrated the detailed metabolic pathway of major bacteria and enzymes responsible for the β oxidation of individual saturated fas c16 0 and c18 0 and unsaturated fas c18 1 and c18 2 c16 0 showed no negative impact on ad the relative enzyme abundance and production of shorter chain fas c16 were steady with continuous biomethane production 739 ml g 1 vs c18 0 and c18 1 demonstrated a significant ad inhibition by contrast c18 2 demonstrated effective degradation and biomethanation these results indicate that β oxidation is directly initiated from saturated c16 0 fas the presence of c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 significantly reduced microbial diversity which recovered in the presence of c16 0 the bacterial genera clostridium sensu stricto 1 syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter were found in high abundance indicating they might be responsible for most lcfa degradation that resulted in biomethane precursors acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were inhibited in the presence of c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 fas conversion of these fas to c16 and shorter chain fas revived the methanogens the level of the initiator enzyme of β oxidation lcfa coa ligase was increased after the conversion of c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 to c16 0 the production of other fas i e c16 leads to a slight improvement in biomethanation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords saturated fatty acids unsaturated fatty acids β oxidation community response biomethanation 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad occurs in a complex and diverse microbiome structure that is primarily affected by substrate type and toxicity ning et al 2018 salama et al 2020 the nature and concentration of long chain fatty acids lcfas can cause toxic effects on microbes mostly by coating the cells and reducing substance transport efficiency via the cell wall salama et al 2019 inhibition of transport efficiency can make β oxidation a major rate limiting step in lcfa digestion lalman and bagley 2002 most of the available literature on lipid waste digestion focused on the enhancement of ad studies have investigated the inhibition of the ad process due to high lipid content with a mixture of lcfas as well as the application of codigestion c n ratio adjustment and use of additives to reduce this inhibition table 1 however the degradation of lcfas and the subsequent microbiome response i e microbial composition enzymes and metabolic pathways have not been investigated together conducting deep and integrated research using individual lcfas considering the aforementioned points is required to understand the major metabolic pathways particularly β oxidation during lipid degradation the β oxidation pathway of lcfas fig s1 is initiated upon their transport through the cellular membrane in the microbial cell via the transport acyl activation mechanism which forms fatty acyl coa houten and wanders 2010 usman et al 2020b the main fa transporters are fa translocase fat cd36 plasma membrane bound tissue specific fa transport protein and fa binding protein fabppm houten and wanders 2010 the conversion of fatty acyl coas to acetyl coa involves a series of four classic enzymatic reactions gilbert barness et al 2017 the saturated fas sfas enter the β oxidation cycle directly whereas the fate of unsaturated fas ufas in β oxidation varies it has been reported that ufas mostly first undergo a process of saturation to be converted to sfas and are then degraded via β oxidation ning et al 2018 sage et al 2008 certain earlier studies have suggested that ufas directly enter the β oxidation pathway and are converted into shorter chain fas lalman and bagley 2000 2001 however most of these studies did not report the detailed degradation pattern and the dynamics of microbial communities under the digestion of either natural lipids or artificial lcfas table 1 to fill such scientific gaps advanced microbiome and metabolome tools must be used to understand the fate of different lcfas β oxidation pathway in ad that can help in the improvement of lipid waste utilization for maximum energy recovery in the present study two different categories of lcfas i e sfas and ufas were used in ad to study their β oxidation biomethanation and microbiome response for sfas palmitic c16 0 and steric c18 0 acids were used as model fatty acids fas whereas oleic 18 1 and linoleic c18 2 acids were used as ufas these fas were selected because of their abundance in nature the degradation patterns of lcfas their intermediates and the enzymes involved were explored to understand the fate of lipid substrates in ad 2 experimental 2 1 inoculum collection and characterization inoculum anaerobic digestion sludge ads for the present study was sampled in the summer season from a domestic biogas plant running on agricultural waste and manure animal and human in youzhong county lanzhou china the

anaerobic environment was provided by flushing the reactors with nitrogen gas ad reactors were incubated at 35 c at 150 rpm reactors without any lcfa addition were run under the same conditions as a

the scod of filtered liquid from ad was measured using a commercial kit usman et al 2020a 2 3 analysis of microbial community microbial diversity under the presence of lcfas was studied via high

synthetic lcfas following the previously reported protocols on the enzyme abundance prediction in ad douglas et al 2020 liu et al 2021 3 results 3 1 biomethanation of different lcfas the effect of different lcfas was studied on biogas and biomethane production gompertz model r2 0 95 fitted well with the high biomethane production curve in the present study figs s2 3 the ad of inoculum used as the control without lcfa addition resulted in the lowest biomethane production fig s3a owing to insufficient nutrients available to microbes for biomethane generation upon the addition of c16 0 sfa stable biomethane production was observed without apparent lag phase and produced the most biogas and biomethane 739 ml g 1 vs fig s3b however the other sfa with 18 carbons chain c18 0 presented a different trend in ad the biomethane production in reactors loaded with c18 0 was delayed up to 60 days fig s3c and continued till the end of the study which was 495 ml g 1 vs a similar trend was followed by the monounsaturated fa mufa of 18 carbon fa c18 1 fig s3d in the case of c18 1 the lag phase was prolonged up to 68 days for biomethane production however biomethane production was 586 ml g 1 vs which was higher than that for c18 0 the addition of pufa in ad displayed a different trend compared with sfa and mufa of 18 carbon chains the second highest biomethane production 620 ml g 1 vs with a comparatively shorter lag phase 40 days was observed during the ad of c18 2 fig s3e the highest efficiency 73 was observed for reactors loaded with c16 0 fas reactor followed by c18 2 reactors having 62 efficiency table s3 the ch4 co2 ratio represents the activity of methanogens initially the ch4 co2 ratio was below that indicated for the higher production of co2 fig s3f control and c16 0 reactors showed an increasing trend in ch4 co2 ratio since the start this was followed by c18 2 which had a ch4 co2 ratio 1 after the lag phase caused by an increase in biomethane production by contrast c18 0 and c18 1 showed a ch4 co2 ratio that gradually increased for 60 70 days after which it was also maintained 1 3 2 ß oxidation of sfas and ufas lcfa addition to ad was evaluated to determine the degradation pattern of sfas mufa and pufa fig 1 changes in carbon numbers in sfas showed a different degradation pattern among sfas c16 0 degradation was observed to be direct fig 1a c16 0 fa was degraded to shorter chain fas such as c14 c6 the concentration of c16 0 decreased over time with the increase of these fas however the accumulation of these shorter chain fas was not observed indicating their continuous conversion to c2 c5 fas in contrast to c16 0 the c18 0 degradation trend was different c18 0 concentration did not decrease rapidly in the reactors fig 1b during c18 0 digestion high c16 0 production was observed with a lower ratio of fas that are c16 from the degradation products it can be observed that c18 0 was not directly degraded to shorter chain fas but first converted to c16 0 which accumulated in the reactors along with the remaining c18 0 the produced c16 0 was then converted to other fas a similar trend was observed in mufa degradation where the reactors were loaded with c18 1 it was observed that c18 1 was majorly converted to c18 0 and c16 0 however the concentration of c18 1 decreased rapidly compared with the reactors that were loaded with c18 0 indicating the faster degradation of c18 1 c18 0 and c16 0 fas were accumulated and later converted to shorter chain fas fig 1c degradation on pufa with a similar carbon number was observed to be different compared with its corresponding sfa and mufa c18 2 fa was observed to be degraded at a quicker pace than c18 0 and c18 1 it was also observed that c18 2 was mostly converted to c16 0 first and then to lower carbon chain fas unlike c18 1 which was first converted to c18 0 and then to c16 0 and scfas fig 1d upon lcfa degradation vfa production c2 c5 was observed in the present study fig 2 acetic c2 propionic c3 isobutyric c4 butyric c4 and isovaleric c5 acid production was observed during the degradation of all lcfas with c2 being the major vfa the lack of substrate in control reactors resulted in the lowest vfa production fig 2a consistent and high production of c2 with low c3 c5 content was observed during the degradation of c16 0 in c16 0 reactors along with c2 production its consumption was also consistent and it prevented the accumulation of vfas fig 2b the degradation of c18 0 was observed to decrease with the accumulation of its degradation product c16 0 we also observed decreased production and consistent accumulation of vfas particularly c2 until 40 days fig 2c upon a decrease in c18 0 after 40 days high vfa production was observed until 60 days after which the decrease in c18 0 and their major degradation products such as c16 0 and c2 was recorded similar to c18 0 degradation vfa production was low initially in reactors loaded with c18 1 until 40 days fig 2d a rapid increase in c2 production was observed during 40 70 days followed by a decrease in vfa content due to consumption however during c18 2 digestion a gradual increase and accumulation of vfas particularly c2 was observed till 40 days fig 2e total vfas consumption occurred afterward resulting in decreased vfas at the digestion period end fig s4 3 3 microbiome shifts under different lcfas the microbial diversity of reactors was decreased in the presence of different saturated and unsaturated lcfa types over time total otus in the inoculum was 720 table s4 in control reactors where no lcfas were added otus decreased to 758 and finally decreased to 607 on the 100th day total shared otus in control groups at different times were 291 which were the highest among all other reactors fig s5a in the presence of c16 0 the shared otus among the samples collected at different times decreased to 286 along with a decrease in total otus to 580 at the end fig s5b the introduction of higher sfas such as c18 0 decreased the diversity more compared with c16 0 where shared otus were decreased to 224 and total otus after 100 days were reduced to 509 fig s5c among the ufas 209 shared otus were observed in the reactors loaded with c18 1 with the lowest otus of 471 observed on the 80th day that increased to 507 on the 100th day this was almost the same as those observed in the reactors loaded with c18 0 fig s5d the initial decrease in otus indicates the toxic effect of c18 1 and the recovery of otus toward the end might be because of c18 1 degradation c18 2 showed an opposite trend compared with other reactors otus decreased to 482 on the 20th day and then continuously increased afterward reaching 571 at the end this indicates lower toxicity of c18 2 toward ad microbes shared otus were 217 which were also higher than those of c18 1 fig s5e otus from different reactors were also compared at their corresponding times to observe community dynamics because of changes in the substrate on the 20th day maximum otus were observed in the control reactor 758 whereas the c18 2 reactors showed the lowest otus 482 shared otus on the 20th day were 241 fig s6a the overall community diversity increased on the 40th day with 219 shared otus among all groups however the highest otus 668 on the 40th day were observed in c18 0 reactors fig s6b shared otus decreased to 199 and 172 on days 60 and 80 respectively fig s6c and d at the end of the study shared otus increased to 248 fig s6e decreased otus during the study might be because of the negative impact of lcfas that resulted in a diverse community a significant variation was observed among the overall communities of different reactors however significant variation was not observed when the overall communities of different times were compared fig s7 β diversity among samples collected at different times from reactors loaded with sfas mufa and pufa was studied via pcoa fig 3 these samples from the control and c16 0 reactors were closely related indicating a stable and similar community meanwhile samples from c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 were plotted together and the results showed that they clustered together however they were separate from the control and c16 0 the sample of the 20th day from c18 0 reactors was observed to be a variant from the remaining cluster this result indicates that initially c18 0 had a strong impact on the microbial community the hierarchal clustering of the samples also showed the similarity among the community of digesters utilizing different lcfas with 18 carbons previous studies on lcfas digestion are mainly focused on identifying their impact on ad however the detailed degradation of lcfas and microbial community analysis are not evaluated table 2 the major microbial phyla reported in ad are firmicutes bacteroidota synergistota proteobacteria euryarchaeota and halobacterota kurade et al 2020 l bräuer et al 2020 lyu et al 2018 usman et al 2020a the major phyla observed in the present study were firmicutes 55 94 bacteroidota 0 6 34 synergistota 1 1 5 5 halobacterota 0 42 7 64 and proteobacteria 0 64 3 5 fig 4 most of the minor phyla remained the same or decreased during the current study comparison of the overall community of all reactors indicated a significant variation in firmicutes bacteroidota and proteobacteria along with some minor phyla however no significant difference was observed in communities that were compared on the basis of time fig s8 3 3 1 bacterial community dynamics under different lcfas the degradation of organic components is mostly performed by the bacterial community the first three stages of ad i e hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis are dominated by bacteria in the present study firmicutes bacteroidota synergistota and proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla firmicutes accounted for 82 of the present bacterial composition in the inoculum 0 days in the control reactor the abundance of firmicutes decreased with time and finally reached 59 at the end 100th day however bacteroidota which was 4 7 initially increased to 29 fig s9a a decrease in firmicutes 55 and an increase in bacteroidota 33 were observed during c16 0 digestion up to 60 days afterward bacteroidota decreased to 22 while firmicutes increased to 70 the relative abundance of other major bacterial phyla decreased during c16 0 digestion in the reactors loaded with c18 0 the abundance of synergistota and proteobacteria increased initially along with the increase in bacteroidota firmicutes remained high with no significant increase over time unlike other reactors firmicutes increased in the reactors loaded with c18 1 the phylum bacteroidota was observed in low abundance on the 20th 40th and 80th days however it increased on 60th and 100th days firmicutes increased on the 20th day during c18 2 digestion however they later decreased with the increase in bacteroidota fig s9a it was observed that firmicutes and bacteroidota majorly contribute to lcfa degradation members of firmicutes are resistant to lcfas and have a high degradation potential for lipid waste and fas moreover bacteroidota can degrade lipids under low concentrations usman et al 2020a the abundance of firmicutes was initially high 93 in the presence of high lcfas bacteroidota dominated after the degradation and decrease in lcfa concentration fig s9 the variation in the abundance of the top 50 bacterial genera observed during the present study is shown in figure s10 most of the bacterial genera were decreased by lcfa addition clostridium sensu stricto 1 syntrophomonas enterococcus terrisporobacter fastidiosipila and sedimentibacter were the major bacterial genera with a dynamic abundance in different reactors fig 5 clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the most dominant bacterial genera in all reactors with a relative abundance of 22 85 64 31 in the control its abundance was nearly stable over time in reactors loaded with c16 0 clostridium sensu stricto 1 population decreased in the presence of lcfas with 18 carbons clostridium sensu stricto 1 population increased indicating its ability to tolerate the presence of sfa mufa and pufa syntrophomonas were observed in very low abundance in the inoculum and control groups in the presence of c16 0 the abundance of syntrophomonas continuously increased up to 29 fold the addition of lcfas with 18 carbons decreased syntrophomonas initially however with the degradation of c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 the syntrophomonas increased by 39 fold in c18 0 37 fold in c18 1 and 17 fold in c18 2 digestion fig 5 fastidiosipila showed a little increase in the control and c16 0 reactors in the presence of c18 0 fastidiosipila increased initially up to 9 and reduced again with a decrease in c18 0 concentration an initial drop in the abundance of fastidiosipila was observed in c18 1 and c18 2 reactors however toward the end the abundance of fastidiosipila showed a small increase sedimentibacter increased in the presence of c16 0 as c16 0 was the main degradation product during other lcfa degradation sedimentibacter was decreased initially in the presence of c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 and increased toward the end as most of the lcfas were degraded to c16 0 and lower fas enterococcus and terrisporobacter which were high in the inoculum decreased in all reactors in the present study fig 5 3 3 2 archaeal community dynamics under different lcfas the presence of lcfas affected the archaeal community the major archaea on the order level found in the present study are presented in figure s9b methanomicrobiales and methanosarcinales were the most abundant methanogenic orders in all reactors methanomicrobiales were abundant in the control and c16 0 reactors moreover its abundance was high initially in other reactors but decreased later on in the c18 2 reactors methanomicrobiales increased at the end as most of the lcfas were degraded methanosarcinales on the other hand were abundant in the presence of 18 carbon lcfas most of the archaeal genera were significantly affected by the presence of lcfas at the genus level methanosarcina methanosaeta methanospirillum methanoculleus methanogenium and methanobrevibacter were found in abundance fig 6 methanogenium and methanobrevibacter were both negatively affected by lcfa presence among the methanogenic genera methanosaeta was abundant 35 65 under the presence of high c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 concentrations upon the degradation of these lcfas to c16 0 and other shorter chain fas methanosarcina became dominant up to 103 fold methanosarcina was active in the presence of c16 0 methanospirillum and methanoculleus were inhibited by the presence of all four lcfas upon the degradation of lcfas both methanogens also increased up to 53 and 55 fold respectively as c18 0 degraded at a reduced pace and was converted to c16 0 the abundance of methanospirillum in the reactors loaded with c18 0 was the lowest 1 because of the accumulation of c18 0 and c16 0 3 3 3 picrust analysis for enzymes involved in lcfas conversation to biomethane according to kegg map 00 071 the major enzymes involved in β oxidation and biomethane production are listed in table 3 the enzyme long chain fa coa ligase ec 6 2 1 3 is responsible for the initiation of the β oxidation pathway whereas acetyl coa c acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 9 and acetyl coa c acyltransferase ec 2 3 1 16 finalize the β oxidation pathway to produce acetyl coa and fatty acyl coa with two carbons less than the original fa ec 6 2 1 3 was found to be stable during c16 0 digestion indicating that the metabolic processes were unaffected while ec 6 2 1 3 decreased during the degradation of c18 0 initially the enzyme concentration recovered after 80 days this enzyme was majorly affected by the presence of c18 1 at first the level of ec 6 2 1 3 decreased in c18 2 reactors but it recovered quickly compared with c18 0 and c18 1 the enzymes ec 2 3 1 16 responsible for finalizing β oxidation also presented a similar trend the enzymes acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 and acetyl coa synthetase ec 6 2 1 1 that are responsible for the interconversion of acetate and acetyl coa were higher in the c18 0 and c18 1 reactors fig 7 delay in biomethane production was observed in these reactors which may have led to the interconversion of these two components as high vfas particularly acetate were also observed two pathways of biomethane production acetate to biomethane m00357 and co2 to biomethane m00567 were observed in the present study kegg map 00 680 the acetate based biomethane production is initiated from acetyl coa the enzyme acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase ec 2 3 1 169 converts acetyl coa to 5 methyl tetrahydromethanopterin 5 methyl thm s pt and co carbon monoxide dehydrogenase ferredoxin ec 1 2 7 4 converts co to co2 the co2 to biomethane pathway starts from the conversion of co2 to formylmethanofuran by the enzyme formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase ec1 2 99 5 currently known as ec 1 2 7 12 formylmethanofuran is then converted by a series of enzymes ec 2 3 1 101 3 5 4 27 1 5 98 1 1 12 98 2 and 1 5 98 2 to 5 methyl thm s pt after the formation of 5 methyl thm s pt both the co2 and acetate to biomethane pathways are similar in which 5 methyl thm s pt is converted to methyl com via tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase ec 2 1 1 86 finally coenzyme b sulfoethylthiotransferase ec 2 8 4 1 converts methyl com to biomethane these three enzymes were low in the presence of lcfas and subsequently increased upon the degradation of lcfas the last enzyme ec 2 8 4 1 was lowest in the reactors loaded with c18 1 where delayed biomethane production was observed fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 fate of biomethane under different lcfas lipid addition in ad has been reported to increase the biogas and biomethane production after a prolonged initial phase ning et al 2018 palatsi et al 2009 pereira et al 2005 silva et al 2016 an increase in the lag time for biogas and biomethane generation has been shown to be related to the concentration of fat oil and grease fog martinez et al 2011 usman et al 2020a zonta et al 2013 as fog is a mixture of lcfas with a varying degree of saturation it cannot be determined which lcfas led to prolonged lag phase and inhibition the addition of c16 0 to ad did not affect the biogas biomethane production rate fig s3b the direct degradation of c16 0 to vfas via β oxidation and the continuous production of biomethane represent its nontoxic nature toward ad microbes moreover c16 0 is a white solid at room temperature which gradually disappeared toward the end of the digestion period a similar trend was reported for c16 0 degradation which proceeded without any inhibition and with the disappearance of white particles at the end eftaxias et al 2020 various lcfas have been reported to inhibit biomethane production even at low concentrations mehariya et al 2018 among sfas unlike c16 0 c18 0 has been reported to result in the inhibition of the ad process owing to several reasons angelidaki and ahring 1992 the inhibition from lipidic feedstock and lcfas might be due to the physical attachment of lcfas to microbial cells resulting in the coating of the cells by lipid layers which disturbs the cellular transport palatsi et al 2012 salama et al 2020 an increase in the lag phase during c18 0 digestion can also be attributed to a reduced degradation rate and accumulation of both lcfas and vfas figs 1 2 the addition of c18 1 mufa also delayed biomethane production during monodigestion c18 1 has a similar inhibitory effect as c18 0 toward biomethane production angelidaki and ahring 1992 increasing the concentration of fog with a high content of c18 1 resulted in an increased lag phase during the monodigestion of fog usman et al 2020a such prolonged lag phase and ultimate inhibition during high fog loadings can be attributed to the presence of c18 1 which was also previously reported by pereira et al 2002 a different finding of biomethane inhibition was also reported where ufas c18 1 and c18 2 were shown to have a higher inhibitory effect than c18 0 ning et al 2018 c18 2 showed lower inhibition than c18 0 and c18 1 with a decreased lag phase of 40 days however compared with c16 0 it showed increased inhibition the temporary inhibition of methanogenic activity was reported because of the presence of c18 2 digestion lalman and bagley 2000 the shorter lag phase and limited inhibition of c18 2 can be attributed to its quicker degradation to vfas via β oxidation 4 2 degradation of sfas and ufas lcfa degradation to acetate and other vfas mainly occurs via the β oxidation pathway which was also identified as a major rate limiting factor during the ad of lipid waste lalman and bagley 2002 usman et al 2020b in the present study c16 0 was degraded directly to c2 with the major intermediates c14 0 c12 0 c10 0 c8 0 and c6 0 fas with odd carbon chains were observed in a lower ratio fig 1a being sfa c16 0 directly enters β oxidation where each cycle removes two carbons this justifies fa production with an even carbon chain sousa et al 2009 a study has reported inhibition due to the intermediate of lcfa degradation cavaleiro et al 2016 however such inhibition was not observed in the present study c2 production was also consistent without accumulation which can be attributed to its conversion to biomethane ning et al 2018 c18 0 was degraded at a reduced rate the accumulation of c18 0 and its degradation product c16 0 was observed fig 1 a previous study on the use of synthetic lcfas did not report its detailed degradation pattern only a few studies have identified c16 0 lcfa as a major intermediate in the degradation of lcfas indicating that the β oxidation of lcfas proceeds via c16 0 table 2 an increase in the c16 0 content from its initial concentration was observed during the digestion of mixed c16 c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 ning et al 2018 a similar trend in the current study was observed where c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 fas were first converted to c16 0 c18 0 digestion with enriched culture was reported to be effective in producing vfas and biomethane angelidaki and ahring 1995 c18 1 was not converted directly to c16 0 because the production of c18 0 was observed along with c16 0 the presence of these sfas indicates that c18 1 degradation occurs via c18 0 and then c16 0 which finally converts to shorter chain fas by β oxidation this trend was different from the previously reported study ning et al 2018 moreover c2 production during c18 1 digestion was also initially low indicating the lower activity of ad microbes both β oxidation and methanogenic activity were inhibited during the increased c18 1 presence and c16 0 was observed to accumulate which represented that β oxidation proceeded via c16 0 pereira et al 2002 c18 2 β oxidation was also observed to occur via c16 0 unlike c18 1 c18 2 was mostly converted to c16 0 with relatively lower production of c18 1 and c18 0 among vfas in c18 2 c2 production was major the production was initially low compared with that produced in reactors loaded with c16 0 but were produced earlier than c18 0 and c18 1 figs 1 and 2e the saturation of pufas and mufas to c16 0 might have occurred before β oxidation because c18 0 was not observed as a major by product during ufa c18 1 and c18 2 degradation the presence of small amounts of c17 1 and c16 1 could be owing to the improper saturation of ufas lalman and bagley 2001 the white partial appearance during the degradation of all c18 fas can be attributed to the production of c16 0 as the main degradation intermediate the reduced degradation of c18 0 compared with its ufas particularly c18 2 can be attributed to the toxicity of c18 0 toward the microbial community and its physical state angelidaki and ahring 1992 lalman and bagley 2001 the availability of c18 1 and c18 2 fas to ad microbes would be high because of their nature at room temperature eftaxias et al 2020 the attachment of liquid ufas to microbial cells may lead to an initial inhibition however it would also force the microbial cell to initiate a degradation mechanism to overcome the inhibition vfa c2 c5 production indicated effective degradation during acidogenesis and acetogenesis saha et al 2019 vfa production and consumption during c16 0 digestion indicated rich bacterial and archaeal communities the bacterial community could degrade c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 resulting in initial vfa accumulation this accumulation of vfas might be caused by the lcfa inhibition of the archaeal community koster and cramer 1987 usman et al 2020a 4 3 shift and role of major microbes during lcfas digestion variation in the abundance and diversity of microbial communities is driven by the nature of the substrate used in ad the actively involved microbial phyla reported in ad are firmicutes bacteroidota synergistota proteobacteria euryarchaeota and halobacterota kurade et al 2020 l bräuer et al 2020 lyu et al 2018 usman et al 2020a the difference in environmental factors such as temperature organic loading suspension ph and mixing ratio and feedstock types influences the ad diversity guo et al 2021 saha et al 2020 the addition of lipid substrate in ad has been reported to reduce the otu count compared with the original inoculum ning et al 2018 salama et al 2020 the variation in the microbial samples observed in the pcoa plot fig 3 indicates that the feedstock nature lcfas type is one of the main factors in shaping the microbial community campanaro et al 2018 clostridium sensu stricto a syntrophic acetate oxidizer sao is found in ad to produce precursors for biomethane production charalambous et al 2020 li et al 2018 most of the members from class clostridia are widely reported in ad owing to their waste degradation and fermentation ability moreover the presence of increased clostridia in the current study can be related to the inoculum source that contained manure dohrmann et al 2015 in the reactors loaded with c16 0 clostridium sensu stricto 1 decreased 0 55 fold with the increase in syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter 29 19 and 2 15 fold the steady degradation of c16 0 production of acetate and its conversion to biomethane indicate that syntrophic acetate oxidation was the lowest which led to a higher abundance of syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter studies have reported the role of syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter in lcfa degradation and their symbiotic relationship with acetoclastic methanogenic archaea salama et al 2020 usman et al 2020a ziels et al 2018 these bacteria appear to be more active in the presence of c16 0 because their abundance was low in the initial stages of fas with 18 carbons fig 5 moreover upon the decrease in their concentration and production of c16 and lower fas the abundance of syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter recovered limited bacterial species can degrade straight chain lcfas having more than 12 carbon and most of them belong to the genus syntrophomonas alves et al 2009 liu et al 2021 the results of previous studies and this study indicates that syntrophomonas is a major lcfas degrader the presence of clostridium sensu stricto 1 had the highest abundance in the c18 1 reactor followed by c18 2 and c18 0 lcfas moreover in these reactors the content of acetate was higher fig 2 clostridium is responsible for the conversion of acetate into co2 and h2 karakashev et al 2006 a lower ch4 co2 ratio indicates a higher co2 production and the oxidation of acetate by clostridium sensu stricto 1 in these reactors fig s3f among archaea both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic microbes were observed along with their pathways methanosaeta is an absolute acetoclastic methanogen whereas methanospirillum and methanoculleus are hydrogenotrophic methanogens species of genus methanosarcina can utilize different substrates and produce biomethane via the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways jain et al 2021 kurade et al 2019 maus et al 2012 methanosaeta was initially high 65 in the presence of lcfas which were replaced by methanosarcina methanospirillum and methanoculleus at the end of digestion the resistive nature of methanosaeta toward high concentration and a mixture of lcfas might explain its high abundance initially where other genera were suppressed carr et al 2018 kurade et al 2019 moreover the low acetate concentration initially might explain the high methanosaeta abundance silva et al 2016 a shift in the abundance of methanosaeta toward methanosarcina was observed upon the decrease in fog concentration methanosarcina is sensitive toward lcfas particularly for fas with 18 carbons kurade et al 2019 as observed in the current study methanospirillum and methanoculleus might also be sensitive to lcfa presence being hydrogenotrophic methanogens the abundance of these increased up to 53 and 54 fold respectively when the sao clostridium sensu stricto 1 also increased most of the hydrogenotrophic methanogens exist in symbiotic relationships with sao charalambous et al 2020 li et al 2018 4 4 enzymes abundance variation during lcfas digestion the use of advanced bioinformatics tools such as picrust provides a deep insight into the different functions of various environmental microbiota such as the ad microbiome ijoma et al 2021 the previous studies have reported the presence of different enzymes during the ad of lcfas liu et al 2021 ziels et al 2018 the picrust analysis indicated the variation in abundance of different enzymes involved in β oxidation and biomethanation fig 7 and table 3 the enzymes ec 6 2 1 3 ec 2 3 1 9 and ec 2 3 1 16 involved in β oxidation showed a similar trend with syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter indicating that β oxidation might be led by these bacterial genera it was reported that the β oxidation of fog led by syntrophomonas after calcium addition liu et al 2021 the species of methanosarcina are mostly reported to produce the enzymes that convert the acetate to acetyl coa zhao et al 2020 the enzymes for the acetoclastic pathway were higher in the current study on the other hand the enzymes for the co2 reduction pathway were in relatively lower abundance in presence of c18 fas most of the methanogenic enzymes were observed in low abundance owing to the high presence of methanosarcina up to 85 and the different enzymes observed fig 7 it may have produced biomethane via both the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic pathways habtewold et al 2018 the presence of both types of enzymes that convert acetate and co2 into biomethane and the presence of the above methanogens indicate that the production of biomethane might have occurred via both pathways however the acetoclastic methanogenic pathway appears to be dominant 4 5 practical implication of this study several full scale ad facilities have been established in different regions across the globe salama et al 2019 ziels et al 2018 lipidic waste has been identified to have the highest theoretical biomethane potential and is being used as a substrate in ad hosseini and wahid 2013 however the lcfas in lipidic waste are toxic to the ad microbes beyond a specific concentration as per our previous findings usman et al 2020a fat oil and grease fog has been used as a substrate in the lab and pilot scale reactors as well as in some large scale plants such as douglas l smith middle basin wastewater treatment plants and des moines metropolitan wastewater reclamation facility in the usa kabouris et al 2012 kurade et al 2019 salama et al 2019 the main concern in the used fog is its diverse fas profile with a higher content of c18 fas 56 4 95 78 abomohra et al 2020 due to which the microbial communities are inhibited leading to low digestibility and biomethane production therefore the current study suggests that a model lipidic feedstock should have a higher c16 and or shorter chain fas content moreover the lcfas conversion to short chain fas by application of various pretreatment approaches might also improve the biomethanation at large scale plants this can help in utilizing a high amount of lipidic feedstocks and economic bioenergy production 5 conclusion lcfas have a different effect on anaerobic digestion ad depending on their chain length and saturation degree c16 0 is the main initiator of β oxidation for all other lcfas c18 0 c18 1 and c18 2 in the case of ufas with a single double bond c18 1 was saturated to c16 0 majorly and c18 0 slightly however during the degradation of c18 2 two double bonds c18 0 was not observed indicating that it might directly pass via the saturation and chain shortening process simultaneously clostridium sensu stricto 1 syntrophomonas and sedimentibacter are majorly involved in lcfas degradation and have a syntrophic relationship with methanosarcina methanospirillum and methanoculleus after the degradation of fas with 18 carbons these methanogens initiated biomethanation this study demonstrated that the conversion of lcfas in the lipid substrate to c16 0 would help avoid inhibition and delay in biomethane production which would help in the utilization

16237,carbon adsorbent fouling by dissolved organic matter dom inhibits the ability of the widely used rapid small scale column test rssct to accurately predict the removal of organic micropollutants omp from water by full scale carbon adsorbers here the adsorption of 11 short chain per poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas from groundwater surface water and wastewater was examined in pilot columns as well as rsscts using constant diffusivity cd and proportional diffusivity pd designs neither the cd or pd rssct accurately predicted pilot adsorber breakthrough of pfas using standard diffusional mass transfer models however pfas breakthrough relative to optical property e g peak c uv absorbance at 254 nm breakthrough remained constant between pilot column cd rssct and pd rssct designs this finding permitted accurate breakthrough predictions for the sum of pfas and for 9 of the 11 pfas on an individual basis in pilot columns using rsscts multiple linear regressions incorporating influent and treated water optical parameters enabled the modeling approach to be applied to water sources with heterogeneous dom characteristics it is hypothesized that this methodology was successful because i optical parameters adequately quantified the competitive nature of dom and their adsorption behaved similar to omp and ii competitive adsorption by low molecular weight dom was the predominant fouling mechanism an omp monitoring approach was developed for waters containing dom with heterogenous characteristics that also relied on raw and treated water optical properties uva254 and fluorescence monitoring could therefore enable water treatment to remove pfas in a variety of scenarios that face inhibitory cost and analytical limitations such as decentralized and low resource settings graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar activated carbon engineering for low resource settings rssct organic micropollutants water treatment 1 introduction carbon filter adsorbers are considered among the best available technologies to control organic micropollutants omp under current or pending regulation by the usepa such as per poly fluoridated alkyl substances pfas in water this paper addresses two longstanding challenges to omp removal by carbonaceous adsorbents 1 obtaining accurate simulations of full scale treatment systems using laboratory bench methods 2 identification of rapid simple low cost surrogates for omp monitoring that can be used for a wide range of water sources by addressing these challenges water treatment for omp removal can be extended into new domains especially decentralized and low resource settings 1 1 fouling obstructs accurate simulation of adsorber performance using lab bench methods because carbon adsorbers typically operate for periods of months to years between regeneration replacement cycles assessing the performance of treatment units using full or pilot scale column tests is often infeasible herein pilot scale refers to a narrow diameter test column with bed depth loading rate empty bed contact time adsorbent particle size operational timescale and omp breakthrough profiles identical to those of the full scale system at a reduced water throughput rapid small scale column test rssct methods have been developed since the 1980 s to simulate removal of omp from water using fixed bed carbon adsorbers in one tenth to one one hundredth the time and water throughput required by pilot tests and at a fraction of the cost crittenden et al 1986 crittenden et al 1987 rssct studies use crushed adsorbent i e smaller particle size and rely on the concept of similitude to scale relevant mass transfer parameters between the small and large columns despite decades of research accurate omp breakthrough simulations of pilot and full scale adsorbers by rsscts have remained elusive kennedy et al 2015 the major barrier to accurate simulation is the complex nonlinear and time dependent nature of fouling by dissolved organic matter dom in columns that use different adsorbent particle sizes kennedy et al 2015 kennedy et al 2017 knappe et al 1999 dom is ubiquitous in natural and anthropogenic waters fouls carbonaceous adsorbents through multiple co occurring phenomena whereby different components of dom compete directly with target omp for adsorption sites and restrict or block omp access to adsorbent pores this reduces omp adsorption capacity and kinetics the complex multiplicative effects of dom fouling are not well captured by diffusional models such as the dispersed flow pore and surface diffusion model psdm a common approach used to scale omp adsorption in rsscts summers et al 2014 accordingly omp breakthrough profiles obtained from rsscts frequently do not match omp breakthrough profiles from pilot columns or full scale treatment units the low molecular weight lmw 1000 daltons fraction of dom molecules that are similar in size and chemical character to many target omp exhibit similar intraparticle diffusion kinetics and adsorption site affinities competitive adsorption by lmw dom is the primary mode of fouling early in the service time of an adsorbent bed i e before dom preloading and significant pore constriction blockage by larger dom molecules takes place kennedy and summers 2015 knappe et al 1997 shimabuku et al 2017 velten et al 2011 wang et al 2021 zietzschmann et al 2014b treatment of weakly adsorbing omp such as short chain pfas necessitates short service times particularly if stringent treatment objectives e g 90 removal are required thus operational regimes for control of weakly adsorbing omp present a special circumstance wherein direct competition by lmw dom is likely the predominant fouling mechanism this could for example explain preliminary experiments with the weakly adsorbing compound 2 methylisoborneol that obtained satisfactory matching of breakthrough profiles between small and large columns treating drinking water summers et al 2013 it remains to be demonstrated whether incorporation of competitive dom into scaling approaches such as the psdm will result in accurate simulation of full scale omp removal by rsscts 1 2 uv and fluorescence optical parameters are sensitive to dom adsorbability and size many of the constituents of dom that adsorb to carbonaceous adsorbents and that contribute to fouling are photo active as they absorb or absorb and emit i e fluoresce photons sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2017 zietzschmann et al 2016 the absorbance of uv light at a wavelength of 254 nm uva254 is an indicator of the quantity of aromatic dom moieties weishaar et al 2003 which are structures that confer an affinity for adsorption to the surfaces of carbonaceous materials uv absorbing dom therefore includes most of the subfractions of bulk dom that are responsible for multi modal fouling sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2017 zietzschmann et al 2016 fluorescence indicators e g peaks a and c overall fluorescence intensity fluorescence index fi have been associated with both chromophoric aromatic dom as well as smaller molecular weight compounds shimabuku et al 2017 competitive dom molecules must not only possess affinity for the adsorbent surface but also be small enough in size to navigate the adsorbent s micropore network by diffusion shimabuku et al 2017 as a result fluorescence measurements have been shown to characterize the competitive fraction of dom shimabuku et al 2014 shimabuku et al 2017 thus incorporating fluorescence indicators into scaling approaches that capture competitive adsorption could enable accurate simulation of full scale adsorbers by rsscts 1 3 use of dom optical properties as monitoring surrogates quantitation of individual omp in raw and treated waters is costly and requires highly sophisticated analytical equipment and specialized expertise e g to perform extensive sample clean up and conduct liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the development of surrogate indicators of adsorbent bed life for omp removal that can be monitored inexpensively would greatly support cost effective water treatment in a multitude of scenarios including drinking water wastewater and stormwater treatment in low to high resource settings uv absorbance and fluorescence parameters have been proposed as proxies or surrogates for evaluating the performance of fixed bed adsorbers for treatment of omp in water attempts to relate omp adsorption by gac to bulk water uv and fluorescence parameters i e a surrogate monitoring approach have shown promise in a few studies anumol et al 2015 kennedy and summers 2015 sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2017 zietzschmann et al 2014a zietzschmann et al 2016 however studies to date have not observed relationships between the breakthrough of dom optical parameters and omp adsorption by gac to be consistent across diverse water sources containing dom of different origins similar conclusions were reached in studies using biochar greiner et al 2018 kearns et al 2020a development of surrogate approach es based on optical parameters that provide consistent results independent of background water chemistry would therefore be a valuable advancement in the context of carbon adsorption treatment processes the specificity of fluorescence peaks a and c as proxies for aromatic adsorbable and potentially competitive lmw dom could provide surrogate indication of an adsorbent bed s remaining capacity for uptake of weakly adsorbing omp as uva254 is less sensitive to dom size it was expected to be a less sensitive proxy for competitive adsorption however in low resource settings where fluorometry is not available uva254 could provide an affordable and technically feasible substitute 1 4 short chain pfas are among the most difficult to adsorb omps a subset of pfas of rapidly emerging concern is short chain compounds defined as compounds with aliphatic backbones of length less than the equivalent of an eight carbon chain for carboxylic acids and a seven carbon chain for sulfonic acids li et al 2020 also included in this group are ether compounds of similar molecular size that have c o bonds substituted in the carbon backbone many short chain pfas have been brought into use as substitutes for long chain phased out legacy pfas for example in the case of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid genx for perfluoroocanoic acid pfoa strynar et al 2015 as the use of short chain pfas becomes more common they are more prevalent as environmental contaminants around the globe appleman et al 2014 kurwadkar et al 2021 additionally the breakdown of long chain pfas ateia et al 2019 which are extremely hydrophilic and are among the most difficult omp to remove from water by carbon appleman et al 2014 herkert et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 and other technologies such as ion exchange dickenson and higgins 2016 wang et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 adsorption onto carbonaceous materials such as granular activated carbon gac anumol et al 2015 appleman et al 2014 herkert et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 mulhern et al 2021 and to a much lesser extent biochar inyang and dickenson 2017 kearns et al 2020a has been researched as a potentially cost effective method for removal of pfas from water biochar adsorbent is of particular interest because it can be generated on site from a variety of biomass precursors using simple scalable technologies often at a fraction of the cost of commercial gac kearns et al 2020a thompson et al 2016 biochar water treatment of pfas and other omp can be applicable in many low resource settings where obtaining gac is infeasible for cost or logistical reasons kearns et al 2014a kearns et al 2015 1 5 study objectives the objectives of this study were to 1 elucidate the adsorption behavior of a mixture of short chain weakly adsorbing pfas compounds and their optically active dom competitor molecules in chemically diverse waters in order to better comprehend dom fouling effects in scaled column tests 2 enable accurate predictions of pfas omp removal in full scale treatment systems from lab bench experiments and 3 develop model s for using dom optical parameters as pfas omp monitoring surrogates for use in decentralized and low resource settings these objectives were pursued by simultaneously monitoring the breakthrough of 11 short chain pfas compounds belonging to three compound classes sulfonates carboxylates and ether compounds and dom optical properties uva254 and fluorescence peak a and peak c from biochar pilot and rssct columns treating three different representative waters groundwater surface water and secondary treated wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar preparation biochar generation conditions are reported in detail in previous studies kearns et al 2020b kearns et al 2019 briefly a 200 l 55 gal drum oven gasifier operated in forced draft mode using a 1 25 horsepower electric squirrel cage blower was used to generate biochar from hardwood pellets at 900 c over a period of 120 min and water quenched the feedstock was pelletized mixed hardwood sawdust purchased from a home and garden supply store no information about which hardwoods were included in the mix was given on the product packaging previous work has shown that wood species does not exert a significant influence on biochar sorption properties kearns et al 2019 kearns et al 2014b rather the pyrolysis process temperature time gas phase composition and sweep rate govern the development of sorption properties kearns et al 2019 biochar pellets were then dried to 10 moisture content ground and sieved to obtain the size fraction retained between 8 and 30 u s standard mesh sieves log mean particle diameter 1 285 mm herein referred to as granular biochar this biochar has been investigated for adsorption of herbicides kearns et al 2020a kearns et al 2019 a variety of omp commonly found in treated wastewater effluent kearns et al 2020b and perfluoroalkyl acids inyang and dickenson 2017 kearns et al 2020b in previous studies and has been shown to have higher adsorption capacity than conventionally generated anaerobic pyrolysis biochars kearns et al 2019 it is referred to in this study simply as biochar samples of granular biochar were crushed by hand using a mortar and pestle and wet sieved using laboratory clean distilled deionized water retaining the fraction captured between 60 and 100 u s standard mesh sieves log mean particle diameter 0 196 mm and 100 and 200 u s standard mesh sieves log mean particle diameter 0 108 mm for rssct experiments as described in detail in section 2 3 2 2 waters and adsorbates water samples were collected in 200 l 55 gal high density polyethylene hdpe barrels for transport to the laboratory groundwater gw was collected from a

approximately 10 000 ng μl in methanol hplc grade from fisher scientific pfpes pfbs genx pmpa pepa and all the internal standards were obtained as 50 ng μl solutions in methanol hplc grade reagent water was used for preparation of the pfas standard and spiking solutions prior to adding to test waters pfas mixture solutions were gently purged with nitrogen gas in order to remove methanol test waters were spiked to obtain final concentrations of individual pfas of 400 to 500 ng l each total pfas concentrations ʃπφας were 5140 ng l for gw 5342 ng l for sw and 4009 ng l for ww 2 3 column testing laboratory column tests pilot and rsscts were developed by maintaining similitude of mass transfer parameters with full scale household units comprised of a filter housing containing a 700 ml refillable cartridge containing 160 g of granular biochar log mean particle diameter dp 1 29 mm operating with an empty bed contact time ebct of 30 minutes and producing 33 6 l of water per day these housing cartridge assemblies are widely available in developed countries and often used as under sink drinking water treatment units containing gac ion exchange resin or particulate filter media they have also been adapted for household water treatment in low resource settings such as using bone char to remove excessive fluoride from groundwater kearns et al 2018 to reduce water throughput requirements compared with full scale contactor here by a factor of 7 8 pilot column tests were conducted using a 2 54 cm 1 inner diameter glass chromatography column kimble chromaflex containing biochar with dp 1 29 mm at a bed depth of 18 cm operated at a flow rate of 3 0 ml min for an ebct of 30 minutes i e identical particle size bed depth loading rate and ebct to full scale constant

that although this study was designed around a household treatment unit the results are applicable to large municipal contactors that operate with similar adsorbent particle size and ebct this is because the mass transfer scaling relationships between full scale columns and rsscts are similar despite the large differences in contactor volume and water throughput between household and municipal treatment systems rssct columns were constructed from polypropylene tubing and stainless steel swagelok hardware and fed using an hplc pump shimadzu lc 20at via peek tubing care was taken to avoid use of ptfe tubing fittings or sealer tape in order to avoid possible fluorochemical contamination from the experimental apparatus 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 pfas analysis 100 μl of the internal

discussion 3 1 pfas and optical parameter breakthrough fig 1 summarizes pfas and optical parameter breakthrough data for gw and sw pilot column experiments and for the ww cd rssct experiment ww pilot pfas data not available breakthrough data for individual pfas and optical parameters for all experiments are provided in figure s1 in all column experiments pfas breakthrough was similar to breakthrough of uva254 and fluorescence peaks a and c the difference in fractional breakthrough c c0 values between any pfas and optical parameter was less than 0 9 90 at all throughput bv values e g if peak c fractional breakthrough was 0 95 each pfas achieved greater than 0 05 breakthrough the general trend was observed that branched ether pfas broke through earliest followed by linear ether pfas carboxylate pfas and sulfonate pfas within pfas sub types shorter chain congeners broke through before longer chain congeners these trends are in agreement with other research ateia et al 2019 herkert et al 2020 li et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 short chain pfas congeners are generally more hydrophilic and less adsorbable pfas chain branching may induce steric hindrance to diffusional transport through the biochar micropore network some column experiments exhibited displacement of the most weakly adsorbed compounds by either more strongly adsorbed compounds such as other pfas or competitive components of the dom background matrix the phenomenon appears when effluent concentrations of individual compounds exceeded their influent concentration i e c c0 1 pmpa pepa and pfpea the most weakly adsorbing pfas compounds in this study were especially susceptible displacement of a comparatively weakly adsorbing pfas genx by a more strongly adsorbing pfas pfoa from activated carbon has been documented wang et al 2019 in gw and sw experiments effluent levels of displaced pfas mostly ranged between 1 0 and 1 1 the ww pd rssct column experienced higher levels of displacement several c c0 values in the range of 1 1 to 1 3 of seven individual pfas these results may suggest that the dom concentration and or character govern s displacement because the highest doc concentration was measured in the ww and ww dom has been shown to be more competitive with omp than sw dom on a per doc normalized basis shimabuku et al 2014 however the ww cd rssct column did not experience pfas displacement figure s1c ww dom exerted the strongest competitive effect for reducing biochar uptake of pfas followed by sw dom and gw dom figure s1a this trend follows dom concentration table 1 but is not fully explained by dom concentration alone discussed in later sections in gw and sw experiments optical parameter breakthrough occurred in the order peak a uva254 peak c in ww experiments uva254 broke through first followed by peak a and peak c the change in breakthrough order for peak a and uv254 is consistent with a previous study that showed dom constituents that dominate fluorescence signals in surface water exhibit different adsorbabilities by gac than those in wastewater effluent shimabuku et al 2017 the peak c uva254 ratio typically exhibits a negative correlation with dom size suggesting that constituents that absorb light and fluoresce in the peak c region are smaller in molecular size than the bulk of uv light absorbing substances shimabuku et al 2017 stewart and wetzel 1980 thus peak c dom is likely more strongly adsorbed than uva254 absorbing dom because it is not only chromophoric which suggests that it is aromatic but is also a low molecular weight sub population of aromatic dom that can access more adsorption sites in the biochar pore network 3 2 optical character of competitive dom in this study short service times up to 1500 bv in pilot columns and a shallow scaled bed depth 18 cm were simulated therefore pore constriction blockage by dom may have been limited and direct competition by lmw dom was likely the prevailing fouling mechanism one way to assess if optically active dom molecules adsorb similar to pfas is to plot the fractional breakthrough of an optical property versus a contaminant of interest fig 2 displays fractional concentration c c0 of dom optical parameters fluorescence peaks a and c uva254 and the sum of pfas compounds ʃpfas ʃpfas fractional breakthrough values were obtained by dividing the sum of individual pfas concentrations in a given effluent sample c by the total concentration of pfas in the test water influent c0 approaches for regulating pfas levels in environmental and treated waters are still under debate as health advisories have been established at state and federal levels in the us for individual pfas or the summation of pfas such as pfoa pfos a summation approach for classes of pfas or total pfas could provide a common treatment objective standard that is conservative for protecting human health and the environment additional advantages of using a summation approach to pfas breakthrough are discussed in later sections discussion of the data shown in fig 2 necessitates making a conceptual distinction between dom adsorbability and competitiveness and how dom optical properties relate to these phenomena dom competitiveness refers to the extent to which dom molecules compete with omp for adsorption sites and reduce an adsorbent s capacity to remove target compounds hastening their breakthrough dom adsorbability and competitiveness are influenced by intrinsic i e dom physical chemical character and extrinsic e g dom concentration factors dom adsorbability is in part a function of dom concentration because adsorbents possess a finite number of adsorption sites and fractional dom removal i e c c0 decreases as initial concentration c0 increases and adsorption sites become exhausted zachman bradley and summers 2010 dom competitiveness also increases with concentration because higher concentrations increase the driving force for dom to compete with omp for adsorption sites shimabuku et al 2014 intrinsic dom character determines dom s affinity for the adsorbent surface as well as dom molecules ability to avoid size exclusion and steric hinderance to reach adsorption sites within the adsorbent micropore network although dom must be adsorbable to compete for omp adsorption sites adsorbable dom might not also be competitive dom for example adsorbable dom might be too large in molecular size to occupy micropore 2 nm pore width omp adsorption sites kearns et al 2019 dom components detectable by uva254 and fluorescence peak c have been shown to preferentially adsorb to activated carbon relative to bulk dom as measured by doc karanfil et al 2000 schreiber et al 2005 shimabuku et al 2017 one reason is because aromatic dom that absorbs light in the near uv range 200 to 380 nm possesses a greater affinity for the graphene rich surfaces of carbonaceous adsorbents compared with aliphatic dom that does not absorb near uv light weishaar et al 2003 because peak c preferentially detects small lmw dom it can measure the presence of adsorbable and competitive dom whereas uva254 quantifies adsorbable dom that may not necessarily compete for omp adsorption sites anumol et al 2015 sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2014 shimabuku et al 2017 compound metrics such as the ratio of peak c to uva254 peak c uva254 and fi have also been used as intrinsic indicators of dom competitiveness as they have been shown to inversely correlate with dom size anumol et al 2015 sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2014 it is instructive to consider adsorption data shown in fig 2 along with figure s1a and s1b and refer to the graphical abstract and the water characteristics listed in table 1 to better understand the interplay between dom adsorption and competition with pfas expressed here for discussion purposes as ʃpfas but with similar applicability to pfas compounds on an individual basis as a relative comparison the data in figure s1a indicate that gw dom was the most adsorbable i e optical indicators broke through latest followed by ww and sw sw was the least adsorbable of the three waters despite having a lower doc concentration than ww and a greater aromaticity as indicated by its specific uva254 suva254 table 1 relative to ww relative dom competitiveness can be gauged by examining ʃpfas breakthrough data shown in figure s1b ʃpfas broke through earliest in ww followed by sw and gw though less aromatic than sw uva254 ww dom was more concentrated doc and contained a larger fraction of potentially competitive lmw dom peak c uva254 fi than sw dom the combined effects of dom adsorbability and competitiveness are folded together into the data as they appear in fig 2 dom that is more adsorbable and competitive would cause data series to shift to the lower right of fig 2 indicating ʃpfas breakthrough at higher fractional concentration levels compared with optical parameter fractional concentration levels i e a higher ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio conversely dom that is less adsorbable and competitive would cause data series to shift towards the upper left of fig 2 with ʃpfas better retained in the adsorbent bed than dom optical parameters i e a lower ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio from upper left to lower right in fig 2 the combination of dom adsorbability and competitiveness increased in the order sw gw ww overlaying dom adsorbability and competitiveness as shown in fig 2 indicates that for example although sw dom is more competitive than gw dom the greater adsorbability of gw dom shifts gw column data series lower and to the right of sw column data series in other words the net effect of gw adsorbability and competitiveness on the ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio is stronger for gw than sw despite the greater absolute competitive effect of sw dom on ʃpfas adsorption in contrast the net effect of ww adsorbability and competitiveness on the ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio is stronger for ww than gw despite the significantly weaker adsorbability of ww dom compared with gw dom figure s1a for comparison of gw and sw the greater adsorbability of gw dom outweighs the greater competitive effect of sw dom on the ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio whereas for comparison of gw and ww the greater competitive effect of ww dom outweighs the greater adsorbability of gw dom on the ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio despite ww dom s significantly lower adsorbability in fig 2 for a given water change in dom concentration alone i e increasing or decreasing doc while keeping dom character constant would not be expected to shift the data series significantly along the upper left to lower right axis an increase in doc would hasten dom breakthrough resulting in a vertical shift of the data series however pfas breakthrough would also occur earlier resulting in a rightward shift of the data series bringing it back into alignment with the former doc concentration thus as shown in fig 2 the effect of extrinsic dom concentration on fractional pfas breakthrough is suppressed however it is possible that dom concentration could have a differential impact on dom competition compared with dom adsorbability thus further research is needed using waters of similar dom character that vary in dom concentration to determine the sensitivity of dom versus omp fractional breakthrough plots to extrinsic dom concentration effects it is noteworthy that the trend in dom adsorbability and competitiveness shown in fig 2 sw gw ww does not align with the trends in doc0 gw sw ww uva254 0 gw ww sw or ʃpfas adsorption ww sw gw it does however align with the trend in peak c uva254 and fi table 1 which are inverse proxies for dom size the sw peak c uva254 and fi values were the lowest of the three waters this suggests that the sw contained primarily large dom molecules and size exclusion could explain the low adsorbability and competitiveness of sw dom it is common for ww to contain a substantial component of low molecular weight dom that exhibits elevated peak c uva254 and fi values relative to non ww impacted waters mostafa et al 2014 shimabuku et al 2017 and ww had the highest peak c uva254 and fi values of the three waters tested in this study peak c uva254 and fi values are greater for gw than sw table 1 it is important to note that gw dom should not a priori be expected to have higher peak c uva254 and fi values the gw sample used for this study was taken from a residential well in a coastal environment it is possible that this gw was relatively shallow and under the influence of local surface water bodies or possibly septic system drain fields as higher fi values suggest dom is derived from microbial activity mcknight et al 2001 also noteworthy is the strong consistency of the relationship between dom optical parameter removal in particular peak c and uva254 and total pfas removal at least from gw and sw across the different types of column tests used in this study pilot cd and pd rssct the significance of this is that for a given source water the relationship between removal of dom optical parameters and the sum of these weakly adsorbing pfas can remain approximately constant over different fixed bed adsorber operational regimes if this relationship can be established for a given water source using pilot or small column testing then treatment system monitoring for pfas control could be accomplished using uv and fluorescence optical parameters with fewer requirements for individual pfas quantitation this is discussed further in later sections less consistency was observed with the ww data as noted significant pfas displacement was observed in the pd rssct experiment but not in the cd rssct experiment this could possibly account for the lack of overlap between ww cd and pd rssct data evident in fig 2 also ww pfas pilot data which could provide additional confirmation are not available from this study therefore further work with weakly adsorbing pfas in ww s is recommended 3 3 regression development for uv and fluorescence surrogate monitoring of pfas removal under some study conditions a nearly one to one relationship was observed between fractional breakthrough of a dom optical parameter and fractional breakthrough of ʃpfas this was the case for example with uva in the gw experiments and peak c in the sw experiments such relationships change across different water sources depending on the competitive nature of dom to account for the influence of dom adsorbability and competitiveness on the relationships between optical property breakthrough and ʃpfas breakthrough multiple linear regression modeling was performed using the statical analysis software minitab minitab 2010 a first order model was used that included interactive terms between model parameters predictors were standardized by subtracting their mean values and dividing by their standard deviation variance inflation factors were calculated using the minitab software and were found to be 1 5 for each predictor included in the models which is much lower than the 5 to 10 cutoff range often used to indicate when predictors should be removed from a model due to collinearity robinson and schumacker 2009 stine 1995 each of the dom optical properties shown in table 1 were input into the model as well as peak c and uva254 breakthrough data a stepwise elimination was performed by eliminating at each step predictors with coefficients that had the highest p value until all coefficients were significant at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 with ʃpfas breakthrough fig 3 displays three approaches for simulating ʃpfas removal using dom optical parameters the regression shown in fig 3a uses influent water fluorescence index fi0 and peak c breakthrough data the regression shown in fig 3b uses influent water peak a and peak c values a0 and c0 respectively and peak c breakthrough data the regression shown in fig 3c requires only measurement of uva254 that of the influent water uva0 and uva breakthrough data the regressions utilizing fluorescence parameters fig 3a and 3b are nearly identical and exhibit slopes close to one 0 9 and intercepts close to zero 0 04 this indicates high correspondence between simulated and measured ʃpfas breakthrough values and that the residuals are normally and randomly distributed adjusted coefficient of determination r2 adj values for these regressions are 0 9 indicating moderate scatter of the data the slope and intercept of the regression shown in fig 3c which relies solely upon uva254 measurement deviate moderately from one and zero slope 0 7 intercept 0 1 and the r2 adj value 0 7 indicates more scatter in the data and less than ideal distribution of residuals compared with the other regressions thus uva254 is expected to be a less precise monitoring surrogate for ʃpfas removal than methods that utilize fluorescence parameters however in low resource settings fluorometry may not be feasible and uva254 monitoring could present the best available option moreover relationships developed between fractional breakthrough of uva254 and omp of interest for a specific water such as those depicted in fig 2 can be used as guides for surrogate monitoring by uva254 as demonstrated in other studies anumol et al 2015 kearns et al 2020a kennedy and summers 2015 sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2017 zietzschmann et al 2014a zietzschmann et al 2016 however this is the first study to our knowledge that has demonstrated how a surrogate monitoring model could be applied to a diverse set of waters and that fluorescence parameters may be more advantageous for this purpose compared with uv absorbance metrics better correspondence between simulated and measured ʃpfas values was observed for gw and sw than for ww in all three regression approaches fig 3 there are a few possible explanations for this the first is to note that fewer ww data points were included in the regression development than for the other waters n 10 for ww 31 for sw and 36 for gw another possible explanation is that the pfas competitive fraction of ww dom could be comprised of a significant population of molecular species that are less sensitive to probing by uv absorbance and fluorescence optical techniques than the pfas competitive dom fractions of sw and gw a third possible explanation is that municipal wws often contain significant amounts of metals for example originating from stormwater runoff and or industrial ww discharges to sewers that affect uv absorbance and fluorescence profiles but do not influence pfas adsorption in the same manner as competitive dom fourth relationships between competitive dom fluorescence and pfas breakthrough might be complicated when pfas displacement is significant as occurred here in the pd rssct ww experiment performing the regression analyses depicted in fig 3a and 3b on gw and sw data and leaving out ww data results in modest improvement in slope intercept and r2 adj values compared with the regressions that included the ww data plots and regression equations displayed in figure s2 likewise using the uva regression analysis fig 3c for gw and sw while omitting ww data results in significant improvements in slope 0 88 intercept 0 04 and r2 adj 0 88 values compared with the regression that included ww data this suggests that greater confidence could be attained when using the regression methods developed here for water sources that are not strongly impacted by ww and where pfas displacement is minimal 3 4 small column forecasting of full scale adsorber performance and surrogate monitoring of pfas mixtures using dom optical parameters this section provides justification for an approach to using rssct studies to quantify breakthrough of key dom optical properties and mixtures of weakly adsorbing pfas that can be used to forecast ʃpfas breakthrough at full scale as well as provide surrogate monitoring of adsorbent bed life for this approach to be valid the relationship between the relevant dom optical properties and ʃpfas breakthrough must be consistent between the rssct and full scale columns whether this is so can be visually gauged by inspecting breakthrough data displayed in fig 2 and figure s1 in fig 2 b and 2 c small column data collapse into a single trend with pilot column data in gw and sw experiments suggesting consistency of the relationships between ʃpfas removal and uva dom or peak c dom at the different column scales correspondence or lack thereof can also be assessed by inspecting breakthrough plots of individual and total pfas and optical parameters displayed in figure s1 for example in gw ʃpfas and peak c breakthrough similarly for the cd rssct and pilot columns whereas the pd rssct consistently overpredicted removal for both ʃpfas and peak c relative to the pilot column there are conceptual reasons why treating mixtures of pfas or other omps as a group of competitive adsorbates i e using the summation approach to breakthrough ʃpfas could improve scaling and prediction by rsscts over individual adsorbate approaches here it is illustrative to think of the constituents of competitive dom and the mixture of individual pfas as constituting an overall population of molecules with overlapping ranges of adsorbabilities competing with one another for adsorption sites uv and fluorescence parameters do not detect individual dom molecules but rather uv active molecular features present among the population of competitive dom molecules there is thus a purposeful analogy for treating pfas not on an individual basis but as a group of compounds with similar adsorption properties to their uv active dom counterparts the analogy is not perfect e g constituents of non competitive dom can also be uv active and moieties of competitive dom can be uv inert however support for this approach is provided by a study that found that fi breakthrough in gac columns could be used as a robust predictor for nitrogenous disinfection by product n dbp formation potential for a range of waters and concluded that fi removal corresponded to removal of n dpb precursor components of dom mulhern et al 2017 to test the robustness of this approach regressions simulating ʃpfas breakthrough from dom optical properties were developed separately from cd and pd rssct data regressions developed from cd rssct data were then used to predict ʃpfas breakthrough in pd rssct and pilot columns using pd rssct and pilot dom optical parameters as inputs for gw and sw only pd rssct in the case of ww similarly regressions developed from pd rssct data were then used to predict ʃpfas breakthrough in cd rssct and pilot columns using cd rssct and pilot dom optical parameters as inputs only cd rssct in the case of ww the results of this exercise are shown in fig 4 the data shown in fig 4 suggest that the relationships between ʃpfas breakthrough and fluorescence parameters fi peak a peak c are conserved between rssct and pilot column operational scales regressions using influent and effluent fluorescence parameters developed from rssct experiments in gw sw and ww i e water containing dom of distinct characters were able to accurately predict ʃpfas breakthrough in other column operational regimes including different sized adsorbent particles using water and column test specific dom optical parameter measurements as inputs cd and pd rssct derived regressions were able to accurately predict pilot experiments as well as one another slopes ranging from 0 93 to 0 99 intercepts ranging from 0 0003 to 0 02 and r2 adj values of 0 83 to 0 91 based only on fi0 and peak c inputs fig 4a and 4d or peak a0 peak c0 and peak c inputs fig 4b and 4e ʃpfas breakthrough predictions using uva254 inputs fig 4c and 4f were less robust than predictions using fluorescence parameters but could be used with appropriate caution in scenarios where fluorometry is not available because three distinct waters were used in this study that varied substantially in their competitive effect it is possible that the models developed here could apply to other surface or groundwaters that might or might not be wastewater impacted it is important to note however that the regressions developed in this study and displayed in fig 4 might not be universally applicable to any adsorbent or adsorber operational regime the relationships between uptake of pfas and uv active dom foulants are likely to differ for other adsorbents other column operational conditions and other suites of target omp the cd rssct pd rssct and pilot columns used in this study were not truly independent unique tests but rather were related to one another in mass transfer similitude via the pore and surface diffusion model the relationships between uptake of pfas and optically active dom foulants could differ for example for an adsorber that uses a shorter or longer scaled ebct than used in this study 30 minutes accordingly the recommended workflow is to 1 conduct an rssct study with the water s and adsorbent s of interest maintaining similitude of mass transfer factors with the full scale treatment unit quantifying target weakly adsorbing pfas and uv fluorescence parameters 2 perform a multiple linear regression analysis as described in section 3 3 to determine system specific coefficients analogous to those shown in the equations accompanying the plots in fig 4 3 estimate ʃpfas breakthrough as predicted by the regression along with ongoing dom optical parameter monitoring which could support less frequent sampling of full scale treatment system effluent for periodic confirmatory pfas analysis 3 5 optical parameter model application for individual pfas compounds in many circumstances focus on individual pfas compounds is clearly warranted to explore the robustness of the method developed here for predicting pfas breakthrough on an individual compound basis multiple linear regression analyses using dom optical parameters were performed for each pfas compound from its breakthrough data results of this exercise are summarized in fig 5 for pmpa and pfhxs the most weakly adsorbed and strongly adsorbed compounds in the study respectively and genx a moderately adsorbed compound compared with others in the study results for the other eight pfas are provided in figure s3 it is evident from visual inspection of figure s1 that in many cases pfas breakthrough in cd and pd rssct experiments did not correspond closely with one another and or with pfas breakthrough in corresponding pilot column tests even so as shown in fig 5 and figure s3 with the exceptions of pmpa and pepa individual pfas breakthrough data in cd pd and pilot column experiments in the three different waters collapsed into trends clustered around the 1 1 measured to simulated line with a fair degree of visual conformity when dom optical parameters uva254 and peak c were incorporated pmpa and pepa were the most weakly adsorbed compounds of the group and experienced displacement by stronger adsorbing molecules more frequently than other pfas displacement could be an explanation for the low coefficient of determination values for the compounds thus this method might not work well for very weakly adsorbed compounds that experience significant displacement by dom molecules or other target adsorbates in some waters conclusions this study demonstrated an accurate approach to predicting removal of weakly adsorbing omp in pilot and full scale adsorber units using downscaled lab bench methods overcoming longstanding research challenges this was accomplished for a mixture of 11 short chain pfas compounds using the rssct with multiple linear regression that incorporates measurement of optically active dom foulants in influent and treated water achieving high levels of removal of weakly adsorbing omp necessitates short operational timescales wherein competitive adsorption is the primary mode of dom fouling under these conditions relationships between adsorption of weakly adsorbing target omp such as short chain pfas and optically active competitive dom were shown to be consistent across fixed bed column scales and diverse source waters this study revealed that uva254 dom and peak c dom correspond well with the dom competitive fraction for short chain pfas compounds and exhibit similar fixed bed breakthrough behavior due to their enhanced adsorbability and ability to access micropore adsorption sites incorporating uva254 dom and peak c dom enabled accurate scaling of total pfas ʃpfas as well as for 9 of the 11 compounds on an individual basis furthermore this study showed that uva254 and fluorescence peak c can be used as monitoring surrogates for remaining pfas adsorption capacity in carbon adsorber units treating waters with diverse background dom characteristics this could save money and analytical resources by reducing the number of water samples that must be analyzed for individual omp to verify compliance with treated water regulatory standards and guidelines though less robust in circumstances where fluorometry is infeasible uva254 alone can provide surrogate monitoring with appropriate cautions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16237,carbon adsorbent fouling by dissolved organic matter dom inhibits the ability of the widely used rapid small scale column test rssct to accurately predict the removal of organic micropollutants omp from water by full scale carbon adsorbers here the adsorption of 11 short chain per poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas from groundwater surface water and wastewater was examined in pilot columns as well as rsscts using constant diffusivity cd and proportional diffusivity pd designs neither the cd or pd rssct accurately predicted pilot adsorber breakthrough of pfas using standard diffusional mass transfer models however pfas breakthrough relative to optical property e g peak c uv absorbance at 254 nm breakthrough remained constant between pilot column cd rssct and pd rssct designs this finding permitted accurate breakthrough predictions for the sum of pfas and for 9 of the 11 pfas on an individual basis in pilot columns using rsscts multiple linear regressions incorporating influent and treated water optical parameters enabled the modeling approach to be applied to water sources with heterogeneous dom characteristics it is hypothesized that this methodology was successful because i optical parameters adequately quantified the competitive nature of dom and their adsorption behaved similar to omp and ii competitive adsorption by low molecular weight dom was the predominant fouling mechanism an omp monitoring approach was developed for waters containing dom with heterogenous characteristics that also relied on raw and treated water optical properties uva254 and fluorescence monitoring could therefore enable water treatment to remove pfas in a variety of scenarios that face inhibitory cost and analytical limitations such as decentralized and low resource settings graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biochar activated carbon engineering for low resource settings rssct organic micropollutants water treatment 1 introduction carbon filter adsorbers are considered among the best available technologies to control organic micropollutants omp under current or pending regulation by the usepa such as per poly fluoridated alkyl substances pfas in water this paper addresses two longstanding challenges to omp removal by carbonaceous adsorbents 1 obtaining accurate simulations of full scale treatment systems using laboratory bench methods 2 identification of rapid simple low cost surrogates for omp monitoring that can be used for a wide range of water sources by addressing these challenges water treatment for omp removal can be extended into new domains especially decentralized and low resource settings 1 1 fouling obstructs accurate simulation of adsorber performance using lab bench methods because carbon adsorbers typically operate for periods of months to years between regeneration replacement cycles assessing the performance of treatment units using full or pilot scale column tests is often infeasible herein pilot scale refers to a narrow diameter test column with bed depth loading rate empty bed contact time adsorbent particle size operational timescale and omp breakthrough profiles identical to those of the full scale system at a reduced water throughput rapid small scale column test rssct methods have been developed since the 1980 s to simulate removal of omp from water using fixed bed carbon adsorbers in one tenth to one one hundredth the time and water throughput required by pilot tests and at a fraction of the cost crittenden et al 1986 crittenden et al 1987 rssct studies use crushed adsorbent i e smaller particle size and rely on the concept of similitude to scale relevant mass transfer parameters between the small and large columns despite decades of research accurate omp breakthrough simulations of pilot and full scale adsorbers by rsscts have remained elusive kennedy et al 2015 the major barrier to accurate simulation is the complex nonlinear and time dependent nature of fouling by dissolved organic matter dom in columns that use different adsorbent particle sizes kennedy et al 2015 kennedy et al 2017 knappe et al 1999 dom is ubiquitous in natural and anthropogenic waters fouls carbonaceous adsorbents through multiple co occurring phenomena whereby different components of dom compete directly with target omp for adsorption sites and restrict or block omp access to adsorbent pores this reduces omp adsorption capacity and kinetics the complex multiplicative effects of dom fouling are not well captured by diffusional models such as the dispersed flow pore and surface diffusion model psdm a common approach used to scale omp adsorption in rsscts summers et al 2014 accordingly omp breakthrough profiles obtained from rsscts frequently do not match omp breakthrough profiles from pilot columns or full scale treatment units the low molecular weight lmw 1000 daltons fraction of dom molecules that are similar in size and chemical character to many target omp exhibit similar intraparticle diffusion kinetics and adsorption site affinities competitive adsorption by lmw dom is the primary mode of fouling early in the service time of an adsorbent bed i e before dom preloading and significant pore constriction blockage by larger dom molecules takes place kennedy and summers 2015 knappe et al 1997 shimabuku et al 2017 velten et al 2011 wang et al 2021 zietzschmann et al 2014b treatment of weakly adsorbing omp such as short chain pfas necessitates short service times particularly if stringent treatment objectives e g 90 removal are required thus operational regimes for control of weakly adsorbing omp present a special circumstance wherein direct competition by lmw dom is likely the predominant fouling mechanism this could for example explain preliminary experiments with the weakly adsorbing compound 2 methylisoborneol that obtained satisfactory matching of breakthrough profiles between small and large columns treating drinking water summers et al 2013 it remains to be demonstrated whether incorporation of competitive dom into scaling approaches such as the psdm will result in accurate simulation of full scale omp removal by rsscts 1 2 uv and fluorescence optical parameters are sensitive to dom adsorbability and size many of the constituents of dom that adsorb to carbonaceous adsorbents and that contribute to fouling are photo active as they absorb or absorb and emit i e fluoresce photons sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2017 zietzschmann et al 2016 the absorbance of uv light at a wavelength of 254 nm uva254 is an indicator of the quantity of aromatic dom moieties weishaar et al 2003 which are structures that confer an affinity for adsorption to the surfaces of carbonaceous materials uv absorbing dom therefore includes most of the subfractions of bulk dom that are responsible for multi modal fouling sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2017 zietzschmann et al 2016 fluorescence indicators e g peaks a and c overall fluorescence intensity fluorescence index fi have been associated with both chromophoric aromatic dom as well as smaller molecular weight compounds shimabuku et al 2017 competitive dom molecules must not only possess affinity for the adsorbent surface but also be small enough in size to navigate the adsorbent s micropore network by diffusion shimabuku et al 2017 as a result fluorescence measurements have been shown to characterize the competitive fraction of dom shimabuku et al 2014 shimabuku et al 2017 thus incorporating fluorescence indicators into scaling approaches that capture competitive adsorption could enable accurate simulation of full scale adsorbers by rsscts 1 3 use of dom optical properties as monitoring surrogates quantitation of individual omp in raw and treated waters is costly and requires highly sophisticated analytical equipment and specialized expertise e g to perform extensive sample clean up and conduct liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the development of surrogate indicators of adsorbent bed life for omp removal that can be monitored inexpensively would greatly support cost effective water treatment in a multitude of scenarios including drinking water wastewater and stormwater treatment in low to high resource settings uv absorbance and fluorescence parameters have been proposed as proxies or surrogates for evaluating the performance of fixed bed adsorbers for treatment of omp in water attempts to relate omp adsorption by gac to bulk water uv and fluorescence parameters i e a surrogate monitoring approach have shown promise in a few studies anumol et al 2015 kennedy and summers 2015 sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2017 zietzschmann et al 2014a zietzschmann et al 2016 however studies to date have not observed relationships between the breakthrough of dom optical parameters and omp adsorption by gac to be consistent across diverse water sources containing dom of different origins similar conclusions were reached in studies using biochar greiner et al 2018 kearns et al 2020a development of surrogate approach es based on optical parameters that provide consistent results independent of background water chemistry would therefore be a valuable advancement in the context of carbon adsorption treatment processes the specificity of fluorescence peaks a and c as proxies for aromatic adsorbable and potentially competitive lmw dom could provide surrogate indication of an adsorbent bed s remaining capacity for uptake of weakly adsorbing omp as uva254 is less sensitive to dom size it was expected to be a less sensitive proxy for competitive adsorption however in low resource settings where fluorometry is not available uva254 could provide an affordable and technically feasible substitute 1 4 short chain pfas are among the most difficult to adsorb omps a subset of pfas of rapidly emerging concern is short chain compounds defined as compounds with aliphatic backbones of length less than the equivalent of an eight carbon chain for carboxylic acids and a seven carbon chain for sulfonic acids li et al 2020 also included in this group are ether compounds of similar molecular size that have c o bonds substituted in the carbon backbone many short chain pfas have been brought into use as substitutes for long chain phased out legacy pfas for example in the case of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid genx for perfluoroocanoic acid pfoa strynar et al 2015 as the use of short chain pfas becomes more common they are more prevalent as environmental contaminants around the globe appleman et al 2014 kurwadkar et al 2021 additionally the breakdown of long chain pfas ateia et al 2019 which are extremely hydrophilic and are among the most difficult omp to remove from water by carbon appleman et al 2014 herkert et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 and other technologies such as ion exchange dickenson and higgins 2016 wang et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 adsorption onto carbonaceous materials such as granular activated carbon gac anumol et al 2015 appleman et al 2014 herkert et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 mulhern et al 2021 and to a much lesser extent biochar inyang and dickenson 2017 kearns et al 2020a has been researched as a potentially cost effective method for removal of pfas from water biochar adsorbent is of particular interest because it can be generated on site from a variety of biomass precursors using simple scalable technologies often at a fraction of the cost of commercial gac kearns et al 2020a thompson et al 2016 biochar water treatment of pfas and other omp can be applicable in many low resource settings where obtaining gac is infeasible for cost or logistical reasons kearns et al 2014a kearns et al 2015 1 5 study objectives the objectives of this study were to 1 elucidate the adsorption behavior of a mixture of short chain weakly adsorbing pfas compounds and their optically active dom competitor molecules in chemically diverse waters in order to better comprehend dom fouling effects in scaled column tests 2 enable accurate predictions of pfas omp removal in full scale treatment systems from lab bench experiments and 3 develop model s for using dom optical parameters as pfas omp monitoring surrogates for use in decentralized and low resource settings these objectives were pursued by simultaneously monitoring the breakthrough of 11 short chain pfas compounds belonging to three compound classes sulfonates carboxylates and ether compounds and dom optical properties uva254 and fluorescence peak a and peak c from biochar pilot and rssct columns treating three different representative waters groundwater surface water and secondary treated wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar preparation biochar generation conditions are reported in detail in previous studies kearns et al 2020b kearns et al 2019 briefly a 200 l 55 gal drum oven gasifier operated in forced draft mode using a 1 25 horsepower electric squirrel cage blower was used to generate biochar from hardwood pellets at 900 c over a period of 120 min and water quenched the feedstock was pelletized mixed hardwood sawdust purchased from a home and garden supply store no information about which hardwoods were included in the mix was given on the product packaging previous work has shown that wood species does not exert a significant influence on biochar sorption properties kearns et al 2019 kearns et al 2014b rather the pyrolysis process temperature time gas phase composition and sweep rate govern the development of sorption properties kearns et al 2019 biochar pellets were then dried to 10 moisture content ground and sieved to obtain the size fraction retained between 8 and 30 u s standard mesh sieves log mean particle diameter 1 285 mm herein referred to as granular biochar this biochar has been investigated for adsorption of herbicides kearns et al 2020a kearns et al 2019 a variety of omp commonly found in treated wastewater effluent kearns et al 2020b and perfluoroalkyl acids inyang and dickenson 2017 kearns et al 2020b in previous studies and has been shown to have higher adsorption capacity than conventionally generated anaerobic pyrolysis biochars kearns et al 2019 it is referred to in this study simply as biochar samples of granular biochar were crushed by hand using a mortar and pestle and wet sieved using laboratory clean distilled deionized water retaining the fraction captured between 60 and 100 u s standard mesh sieves log mean particle diameter 0 196 mm and 100 and 200 u s standard mesh sieves log mean particle diameter 0 108 mm for rssct experiments as described in detail in section 2 3 2 2 waters and adsorbates water samples were collected in 200 l 55 gal high density polyethylene hdpe barrels for transport to the laboratory groundwater gw was collected from a private well in wilmington nc surface water sw was collected from the raw water intake at the drinking water treatment plant in wilmington nc wastewater ww was collected after secondary treatment by sand filtration at the wastewater treatment plant in durham nc water samples were circulated through a 1 μm polypropylene fiber filter for approximately eight hours to remove particulates filtered

from wellington laboratories canada pepa and pmpa were obtained from the chemours company pfmopra pfmoba pfhpa pfpea pfhxs were obtained in solid state they were prepared to a liquid concentration of approximately 10 000 ng μl in methanol hplc grade from fisher scientific pfpes pfbs genx pmpa pepa and all the internal standards were obtained as 50 ng μl solutions in methanol hplc grade reagent water was used for preparation of the pfas standard and spiking solutions prior to adding to test waters pfas mixture solutions were gently purged with nitrogen gas in order to remove methanol test waters were spiked to obtain final concentrations of individual pfas of 400 to 500 ng l each total pfas concentrations ʃπφας were 5140 ng l for gw 5342 ng l for sw and 4009 ng l for ww 2 3 column testing laboratory column tests pilot and rsscts were developed by maintaining similitude of mass transfer parameters with full scale household units comprised of a filter housing containing a 700 ml refillable cartridge containing 160 g of granular biochar log mean particle diameter dp 1 29 mm operating with an empty bed contact time ebct of 30 minutes and producing 33 6 l of water per day these housing cartridge assemblies are widely available in developed countries and often used as under sink drinking water treatment units containing gac ion exchange resin or particulate filter media they have also been adapted for household water treatment in low resource settings such as using bone char to remove excessive fluoride from groundwater kearns et al 2018 to reduce water throughput requirements compared with full scale contactor here by a factor of 7 8 pilot column tests were conducted using a 2 54 cm 1 inner diameter glass chromatography column kimble chromaflex containing biochar with dp 1 29 mm at a bed depth of 18 cm operated at a flow rate of 3 0 ml min for an ebct of 30 minutes i e identical particle size bed depth loading rate and ebct to full scale constant diffusivity cd and proportional diffusivity pd rssct columns were designed using eq 1 by setting the diffusivity factor x equal to zero for cd and one for pd 1 e b c t r s s c t e b c t p i l o t d p r s s c t d p p i l o t 2 x pilot and rssct column operational parameters and those of the full scale fixed bed biochar contactor they are based on are summarized in table 3 it is important to note that although this study was designed around a household treatment unit the results are applicable to large municipal contactors that operate with similar adsorbent particle size and ebct this is because the mass transfer scaling relationships between full scale columns and rsscts are similar despite the large differences in contactor volume and water throughput between household and municipal treatment systems rssct columns were constructed from polypropylene tubing and stainless steel swagelok hardware and fed using an hplc pump shimadzu lc 20at via peek tubing care was taken to avoid use of ptfe tubing fittings or sealer tape in order to avoid possible fluorochemical contamination from the experimental apparatus 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 pfas analysis 100 μl of the internal

discussion 3 1 pfas and optical parameter breakthrough fig 1 summarizes pfas and optical parameter breakthrough data for gw and sw pilot column experiments and for the ww cd rssct experiment ww pilot pfas data not available breakthrough data for individual pfas and optical parameters for all experiments are provided in figure s1 in all column experiments pfas breakthrough was similar to breakthrough of uva254 and fluorescence peaks a and c the difference in fractional breakthrough c c0 values between any pfas and optical parameter was less than 0 9 90 at all throughput bv values e g if peak c fractional breakthrough was 0 95 each pfas achieved greater than 0 05 breakthrough the general trend was observed that branched ether pfas broke through earliest followed by linear ether pfas carboxylate pfas and sulfonate pfas within pfas sub types shorter chain congeners broke through before longer chain congeners these trends are in agreement with other research ateia et al 2019 herkert et al 2020 li et al 2020 mccleaf et al 2017 short chain pfas congeners are generally more hydrophilic and less adsorbable pfas chain branching may induce steric hindrance to diffusional transport through the biochar micropore network some column experiments exhibited displacement of the most weakly adsorbed compounds by either more strongly adsorbed compounds such as other pfas or competitive components of the dom background matrix the phenomenon appears when effluent concentrations of individual compounds exceeded their influent concentration i e c c0 1 pmpa pepa and pfpea the most weakly adsorbing pfas compounds in this study were especially susceptible displacement of a comparatively weakly adsorbing pfas genx by a more strongly adsorbing pfas pfoa from activated carbon has been documented wang et al 2019 in gw and sw experiments effluent levels of displaced pfas mostly ranged between 1 0 and 1 1 the ww pd rssct column experienced higher levels of displacement several c c0 values in the range of 1 1 to 1 3 of seven individual pfas these results may suggest that the dom concentration and or character govern s displacement because the highest doc concentration was measured in the ww and ww dom has been shown to be more competitive with omp than sw dom on a per doc normalized basis shimabuku et al 2014 however the ww cd rssct column did not experience pfas displacement figure s1c ww dom exerted the strongest competitive effect for reducing biochar uptake of pfas followed by sw dom and gw dom figure s1a this trend follows dom concentration table 1 but is not fully explained by dom concentration alone discussed in later sections in gw and sw experiments optical parameter breakthrough occurred in the order peak a uva254 peak c in ww experiments uva254 broke through first followed by peak a and peak c the change in breakthrough order for peak a and uv254 is consistent with a previous study that showed dom constituents that dominate fluorescence signals in surface water exhibit different adsorbabilities by gac than those in wastewater effluent shimabuku et al 2017 the peak c uva254 ratio typically exhibits a negative correlation with dom size suggesting that constituents that absorb light and fluoresce in the peak c region are smaller in molecular size than the bulk of uv light absorbing substances shimabuku et al 2017 stewart and wetzel 1980 thus peak c dom is likely more strongly adsorbed than uva254 absorbing dom because it is not only chromophoric which suggests that it is aromatic but is also a low molecular weight sub population of aromatic dom that can access more adsorption sites in the biochar pore network 3 2 optical character of competitive dom in this study short service times up to 1500 bv in pilot columns and a shallow scaled bed depth 18 cm were simulated therefore pore constriction blockage by dom may have been limited and direct competition by lmw dom was likely the prevailing fouling mechanism one way to assess if optically active dom molecules adsorb similar to pfas is to plot the fractional breakthrough of an optical property versus a contaminant of interest fig 2 displays fractional concentration c c0 of dom optical parameters fluorescence peaks a and c uva254 and the sum of pfas compounds ʃpfas ʃpfas fractional breakthrough values were obtained by dividing the sum of individual pfas concentrations in a given effluent sample c by the total concentration of pfas in the test water influent c0 approaches for regulating pfas levels in environmental and treated waters are still under debate as health advisories have been established at state and federal levels in the us for individual pfas or the summation of pfas such as pfoa pfos a summation approach for classes of pfas or total pfas could provide a common treatment objective standard that is conservative for protecting human health and the environment additional advantages of using a summation approach to pfas breakthrough are discussed in later sections discussion of the data shown in fig 2 necessitates making a conceptual distinction between dom adsorbability and competitiveness and how dom optical properties relate to these phenomena dom competitiveness refers to the extent to which dom molecules compete with omp for adsorption sites and reduce an adsorbent s capacity to remove target compounds hastening their breakthrough dom adsorbability and competitiveness are influenced by intrinsic i e dom physical chemical character and extrinsic e g dom concentration factors dom adsorbability is in part a function of dom concentration because adsorbents possess a finite number of adsorption sites and fractional dom removal i e c c0 decreases as initial concentration c0 increases and adsorption sites become exhausted zachman bradley and summers 2010 dom competitiveness also increases with concentration because higher concentrations increase the driving force for dom to compete with omp for adsorption sites shimabuku et al 2014 intrinsic dom character determines dom s affinity for the adsorbent surface as well as dom molecules ability to avoid size exclusion and steric hinderance to reach adsorption sites within the adsorbent micropore network although dom must be adsorbable to compete for omp adsorption sites adsorbable dom might not also be competitive dom for example adsorbable dom might be too large in molecular size to occupy micropore 2 nm pore width omp adsorption sites kearns et al 2019 dom components detectable by uva254 and fluorescence peak c have been shown to preferentially adsorb to activated carbon relative to bulk dom as measured by doc karanfil et al 2000 schreiber et al 2005 shimabuku et al 2017 one reason is because aromatic dom that absorbs light in the near uv range 200 to 380 nm possesses a greater affinity for the graphene rich surfaces of carbonaceous adsorbents compared with aliphatic dom that does not absorb near uv light weishaar et al 2003 because peak c preferentially detects small lmw dom it can measure the presence of adsorbable and competitive dom whereas uva254 quantifies adsorbable dom that may not necessarily compete for omp adsorption sites anumol et al 2015 sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2014 shimabuku et al 2017 compound metrics such as the ratio of peak c to uva254 peak c uva254 and fi have also been used as intrinsic indicators of dom competitiveness as they have been shown to inversely correlate with dom size anumol et al 2015 sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2014 it is instructive to consider adsorption data shown in fig 2 along with figure s1a and s1b and refer to the graphical abstract and the water characteristics listed in table 1 to better understand the interplay between dom adsorption and competition with pfas expressed here for discussion purposes as ʃpfas but with similar applicability to pfas compounds on an individual basis as a relative comparison the data in figure s1a indicate that gw dom was the most adsorbable i e optical indicators broke through latest followed by ww and sw sw was the least adsorbable of the three waters despite having a lower doc concentration than ww and a greater aromaticity as indicated by its specific uva254 suva254 table 1 relative to ww relative dom competitiveness can be gauged by examining ʃpfas breakthrough data shown in figure s1b ʃpfas broke through earliest in ww followed by sw and gw though less aromatic than sw uva254 ww dom was more concentrated doc and contained a larger fraction of potentially competitive lmw dom peak c uva254 fi than sw dom the combined effects of dom adsorbability and competitiveness are folded together into the data as they appear in fig 2 dom that is more adsorbable and competitive would cause data series to shift to the lower right of fig 2 indicating ʃpfas breakthrough at higher fractional concentration levels compared with optical parameter fractional concentration levels i e a higher ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio conversely dom that is less adsorbable and competitive would cause data series to shift towards the upper left of fig 2 with ʃpfas better retained in the adsorbent bed than dom optical parameters i e a lower ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio from upper left to lower right in fig 2 the combination of dom adsorbability and competitiveness increased in the order sw gw ww overlaying dom adsorbability and competitiveness as shown in fig 2 indicates that for example although sw dom is more competitive than gw dom the greater adsorbability of gw dom shifts gw column data series lower and to the right of sw column data series in other words the net effect of gw adsorbability and competitiveness on the ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio is stronger for gw than sw despite the greater absolute competitive effect of sw dom on ʃpfas adsorption in contrast the net effect of ww adsorbability and competitiveness on the ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio is stronger for ww than gw despite the significantly weaker adsorbability of ww dom compared with gw dom figure s1a for comparison of gw and sw the greater adsorbability of gw dom outweighs the greater competitive effect of sw dom on the ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio whereas for comparison of gw and ww the greater competitive effect of ww dom outweighs the greater adsorbability of gw dom on the ʃpfas optical dom breakthrough ratio despite ww dom s significantly lower adsorbability in fig 2 for a given water change in dom concentration alone i e increasing or decreasing doc while keeping dom character constant would not be expected to shift the data series significantly along the upper left to lower right axis an increase in doc would hasten dom breakthrough resulting in a vertical shift of the data series however pfas breakthrough would also occur earlier resulting in a rightward shift of the data series bringing it back into alignment with the former doc concentration thus as shown in fig 2 the effect of extrinsic dom concentration on fractional pfas breakthrough is suppressed however it is possible that dom concentration could have a differential impact on dom competition compared with dom adsorbability thus further research is needed using waters of similar dom character that vary in dom concentration to determine the sensitivity of dom versus omp fractional breakthrough plots to extrinsic dom concentration effects it is noteworthy that the trend in dom adsorbability and competitiveness shown in fig 2 sw gw ww does not align with the trends in doc0 gw sw ww uva254 0 gw ww sw or ʃpfas adsorption ww sw gw it does however align with the trend in peak c uva254 and fi table 1 which are inverse proxies for dom size the sw peak c uva254 and fi values were the lowest of the three waters this suggests that the sw contained primarily large dom molecules and size exclusion could explain the low adsorbability and competitiveness of sw dom it is common for ww to contain a substantial component of low molecular weight dom that exhibits elevated peak c uva254 and fi values relative to non ww impacted waters mostafa et al 2014 shimabuku et al 2017 and ww had the highest peak c uva254 and fi values of the three waters tested in this study peak c uva254 and fi values are greater for gw than sw table 1 it is important to note that gw dom should not a priori be expected to have higher peak c uva254 and fi values the gw sample used for this study was taken from a residential well in a coastal environment it is possible that this gw was relatively shallow and under the influence of local surface water bodies or possibly septic system drain fields as higher fi values suggest dom is derived from microbial activity mcknight et al 2001 also noteworthy is the strong consistency of the relationship between dom optical parameter removal in particular peak c and uva254 and total pfas removal at least from gw and sw across the different types of column tests used in this study pilot cd and pd rssct the significance of this is that for a given source water the relationship between removal of dom optical parameters and the sum of these weakly adsorbing pfas can remain approximately constant over different fixed bed adsorber operational regimes if this relationship can be established for a given water source using pilot or small column testing then treatment system monitoring for pfas control could be accomplished using uv and fluorescence optical parameters with fewer requirements for individual pfas quantitation this is discussed further in later sections less consistency was observed with the ww data as noted significant pfas displacement was observed in the pd rssct experiment but not in the cd rssct experiment this could possibly account for the lack of overlap between ww cd and pd rssct data evident in fig 2 also ww pfas pilot data which could provide additional confirmation are not available from this study therefore further work with weakly adsorbing pfas in ww s is recommended 3 3 regression development for uv and fluorescence surrogate monitoring of pfas removal under some study conditions a nearly one to one relationship was observed between fractional breakthrough of a dom optical parameter and fractional breakthrough of ʃpfas this was the case for example with uva in the gw experiments and peak c in the sw experiments such relationships change across different water sources depending on the competitive nature of dom to account for the influence of dom adsorbability and competitiveness on the relationships between optical property breakthrough and ʃpfas breakthrough multiple linear regression modeling was performed using the statical analysis software minitab minitab 2010 a first order model was used that included interactive terms between model parameters predictors were standardized by subtracting their mean values and dividing by their standard deviation variance inflation factors were calculated using the minitab software and were found to be 1 5 for each predictor included in the models which is much lower than the 5 to 10 cutoff range often used to indicate when predictors should be removed from a model due to collinearity robinson and schumacker 2009 stine 1995 each of the dom optical properties shown in table 1 were input into the model as well as peak c and uva254 breakthrough data a stepwise elimination was performed by eliminating at each step predictors with coefficients that had the highest p value until all coefficients were significant at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 with ʃpfas breakthrough fig 3 displays three approaches for simulating ʃpfas removal using dom optical parameters the regression shown in fig 3a uses influent water fluorescence index fi0 and peak c breakthrough data the regression shown in fig 3b uses influent water peak a and peak c values a0 and c0 respectively and peak c breakthrough data the regression shown in fig 3c requires only measurement of uva254 that of the influent water uva0 and uva breakthrough data the regressions utilizing fluorescence parameters fig 3a and 3b are nearly identical and exhibit slopes close to one 0 9 and intercepts close to zero 0 04 this indicates high correspondence between simulated and measured ʃpfas breakthrough values and that the residuals are normally and randomly distributed adjusted coefficient of determination r2 adj values for these regressions are 0 9 indicating moderate scatter of the data the slope and intercept of the regression shown in fig 3c which relies solely upon uva254 measurement deviate moderately from one and zero slope 0 7 intercept 0 1 and the r2 adj value 0 7 indicates more scatter in the data and less than ideal distribution of residuals compared with the other regressions thus uva254 is expected to be a less precise monitoring surrogate for ʃpfas removal than methods that utilize fluorescence parameters however in low resource settings fluorometry may not be feasible and uva254 monitoring could present the best available option moreover relationships developed between fractional breakthrough of uva254 and omp of interest for a specific water such as those depicted in fig 2 can be used as guides for surrogate monitoring by uva254 as demonstrated in other studies anumol et al 2015 kearns et al 2020a kennedy and summers 2015 sgroi et al 2018 shimabuku et al 2017 zietzschmann et al 2014a zietzschmann et al 2016 however this is the first study to our knowledge that has demonstrated how a surrogate monitoring model could be applied to a diverse set of waters and that fluorescence parameters may be more advantageous for this purpose compared with uv absorbance metrics better correspondence between simulated and measured ʃpfas values was observed for gw and sw than for ww in all three regression approaches fig 3 there are a few possible explanations for this the first is to note that fewer ww data points were included in the regression development than for the other waters n 10 for ww 31 for sw and 36 for gw another possible explanation is that the pfas competitive fraction of ww dom could be comprised of a significant population of molecular species that are less sensitive to probing by uv absorbance and fluorescence optical techniques than the pfas competitive dom fractions of sw and gw a third possible explanation is that municipal wws often contain significant amounts of metals for example originating from stormwater runoff and or industrial ww discharges to sewers that affect uv absorbance and fluorescence profiles but do not influence pfas adsorption in the same manner as competitive dom fourth relationships between competitive dom fluorescence and pfas breakthrough might be complicated when pfas displacement is significant as occurred here in the pd rssct ww experiment performing the regression analyses depicted in fig 3a and 3b on gw and sw data and leaving out ww data results in modest improvement in slope intercept and r2 adj values compared with the regressions that included the ww data plots and regression equations displayed in figure s2 likewise using the uva regression analysis fig 3c for gw and sw while omitting ww data results in significant improvements in slope 0 88 intercept 0 04 and r2 adj 0 88 values compared with the regression that included ww data this suggests that greater confidence could be attained when using the regression methods developed here for water sources that are not strongly impacted by ww and where pfas displacement is minimal 3 4 small column forecasting of full scale adsorber performance and surrogate monitoring of pfas mixtures using dom optical parameters this section provides justification for an approach to using rssct studies to quantify breakthrough of key dom optical properties and mixtures of weakly adsorbing pfas that can be used to forecast ʃpfas breakthrough at full scale as well as provide surrogate monitoring of adsorbent bed life for this approach to be valid the relationship between the relevant dom optical properties and ʃpfas breakthrough must be consistent between the rssct and full scale columns whether this is so can be visually gauged by inspecting breakthrough data displayed in fig 2 and figure s1 in fig 2 b and 2 c small column data collapse into a single trend with pilot column data in gw and sw experiments suggesting consistency of the relationships between ʃpfas removal and uva dom or peak c dom at the different column scales correspondence or lack thereof can also be assessed by inspecting breakthrough plots of individual and total pfas and optical parameters displayed in figure s1 for example in gw ʃpfas and peak c breakthrough similarly for the cd rssct and pilot columns whereas the pd rssct consistently overpredicted removal for both ʃpfas and peak c relative to the pilot column there are conceptual reasons why treating mixtures of pfas or other omps as a group of competitive adsorbates i e using the summation approach to breakthrough ʃpfas could improve scaling and prediction by rsscts over individual adsorbate approaches here it is illustrative to think of the constituents of competitive dom and the mixture of individual pfas as constituting an overall population of molecules with overlapping ranges of adsorbabilities competing with one another for adsorption sites uv and fluorescence parameters do not detect individual dom molecules but rather uv active molecular features present among the population of competitive dom molecules there is thus a purposeful analogy for treating pfas not on an individual basis but as a group of compounds with similar adsorption properties to their uv active dom counterparts the analogy is not perfect e g constituents of non competitive dom can also be uv active and moieties of competitive dom can be uv inert however support for this approach is provided by a study that found that fi breakthrough in gac columns could be used as a robust predictor for nitrogenous disinfection by product n dbp formation potential for a range of waters and concluded that fi removal corresponded to removal of n dpb precursor components of dom mulhern et al 2017 to test the robustness of this approach regressions simulating ʃpfas breakthrough from dom optical properties were developed separately from cd and pd rssct data regressions developed from cd rssct data were then used to predict ʃpfas breakthrough in pd rssct and pilot columns using pd rssct and pilot dom optical parameters as inputs for gw and sw only pd rssct in the case of ww similarly regressions developed from pd rssct data were then used to predict ʃpfas breakthrough in cd rssct and pilot columns using cd rssct and pilot dom optical parameters as inputs only cd rssct in the case of ww the results of this exercise are shown in fig 4 the data shown in fig 4 suggest that the relationships between ʃpfas breakthrough and fluorescence parameters fi peak a peak c are conserved between rssct and pilot column operational scales regressions using influent and effluent fluorescence parameters developed from rssct experiments in gw sw and ww i e water containing dom of distinct characters were able to accurately predict ʃpfas breakthrough in other column operational regimes including different sized adsorbent particles using water and column test specific dom optical parameter measurements as inputs cd and pd rssct derived regressions were able to accurately predict pilot experiments as well as one another slopes ranging from 0 93 to 0 99 intercepts ranging from 0 0003 to 0 02 and r2 adj values of 0 83 to 0 91 based only on fi0 and peak c inputs fig 4a and 4d or peak a0 peak c0 and peak c inputs fig 4b and 4e ʃpfas breakthrough predictions using uva254 inputs fig 4c and 4f were less robust than predictions using fluorescence parameters but could be used with appropriate caution in scenarios where fluorometry is not available because three distinct waters were used in this study that varied substantially in their competitive effect it is possible that the models developed here could apply to other surface or groundwaters that might or might not be wastewater impacted it is important to note however that the regressions developed in this study and displayed in fig 4 might not be universally applicable to any adsorbent or adsorber operational regime the relationships between uptake of pfas and uv active dom foulants are likely to differ for other adsorbents other column operational conditions and other suites of target omp the cd rssct pd rssct and pilot columns used in this study were not truly independent unique tests but rather were related to one another in mass transfer similitude via the pore and surface diffusion model the relationships between uptake of pfas and optically active dom foulants could differ for example for an adsorber that uses a shorter or longer scaled ebct than used in this study 30 minutes accordingly the recommended workflow is to 1 conduct an rssct study with the water s and adsorbent s of interest maintaining similitude of mass transfer factors with the full scale treatment unit quantifying target weakly adsorbing pfas and uv fluorescence parameters 2 perform a multiple linear regression analysis as described in section 3 3 to determine system specific coefficients analogous to those shown in the equations accompanying the plots in fig 4 3 estimate ʃpfas breakthrough as predicted by the regression along with ongoing dom optical parameter monitoring which could support less frequent sampling of full scale treatment system effluent for periodic confirmatory pfas analysis 3 5 optical parameter model application for individual pfas compounds in many circumstances focus on individual pfas compounds is clearly warranted to explore the robustness of the method developed here for predicting pfas breakthrough on an individual compound basis multiple linear regression analyses using dom optical parameters were performed for each pfas compound from its breakthrough data results of this exercise are summarized in fig 5 for pmpa and pfhxs the most weakly adsorbed and strongly adsorbed compounds in the study respectively and genx a moderately adsorbed compound compared with others in the study results for the other eight pfas are provided in figure s3 it is evident from visual inspection of figure s1 that in many cases pfas breakthrough in cd and pd rssct experiments did not correspond closely with one another and or with pfas breakthrough in corresponding pilot column tests even so as shown in fig 5 and figure s3 with the exceptions of pmpa and pepa individual pfas breakthrough data in cd pd and pilot column experiments in the three different waters collapsed into trends clustered around the 1 1 measured to simulated line with a fair degree of visual conformity when dom optical parameters uva254 and peak c were incorporated pmpa and pepa were the most weakly adsorbed compounds of the group and experienced displacement by stronger adsorbing molecules more frequently than other pfas displacement could be an explanation for the low coefficient of determination values for the compounds thus this method might not work well for very weakly adsorbed compounds that experience significant displacement by dom molecules or other target adsorbates in some waters conclusions this study demonstrated an accurate approach to predicting removal of weakly adsorbing omp in pilot and full scale adsorber units using downscaled lab bench methods overcoming longstanding research challenges this was accomplished for a mixture of 11 short chain pfas compounds using the rssct with multiple linear regression that incorporates measurement of optically active dom foulants in influent and treated water achieving high levels of removal of weakly adsorbing omp necessitates short operational timescales wherein competitive adsorption is the primary mode of dom fouling under these conditions relationships between adsorption of weakly adsorbing target omp such as short chain pfas and optically active competitive dom were shown to be consistent across fixed bed column scales and diverse source waters this study revealed that uva254 dom and peak c dom correspond well with the dom competitive fraction for short chain pfas compounds and exhibit similar fixed bed breakthrough behavior due to their enhanced adsorbability and ability to access micropore adsorption sites incorporating uva254 dom and peak c dom enabled accurate scaling of total pfas ʃpfas as well as for 9 of the 11 compounds on an individual basis furthermore this study showed that uva254 and fluorescence peak c can be used as monitoring surrogates for remaining pfas adsorption capacity in carbon adsorber units treating waters with diverse background dom characteristics this could save money and analytical resources by reducing the number of water samples that must be analyzed for individual omp to verify compliance with treated water regulatory standards and guidelines though less robust in circumstances where fluorometry is infeasible uva254 alone can provide surrogate monitoring with appropriate cautions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16238,reactive intermediates formed upon irradiation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom contribute to the degradation of various organic contaminants in surface waters besides well studied short lived photooxidants such as triplet state cdom 3cdom or singlet oxygen cdom derived long lived photooxidants llpo have been suggested as key players in the transformation of electron rich contaminants llpo were hypothesized to mainly consist of phenoxyl radicals derived from phenolic moieties in the cdom to test this hypothesis and to better characterize llpo the transformation kinetics of selected target compounds phenols and anilines induced by a suite of electron poor model phenoxyl radicals was studied in aerated aqueous solution at ph 8 the phenoxyl radicals were generated by photosensitized oxidation of the parent phenols using aromatic ketones as photosensitizers under steady state irradiation the presence of any of the electron poor phenols lead to an enhanced abatement of the phenolic target compounds at an initial concentration of 1 0 10 7 m compared to solutions containing the photosensitizer but no electron poor phenol a trend of increasing reactivity with increasing one electron reduction potential of the electron poor phenoxyl radical range 0 85 1 12 v vs standard hydrogen electrode was observed using the excited triplet state of 2 acetonaphthone as a selective oxidant for phenols it was observed that the reactivity correlated with the concentration of electron poor phenoxide present in solution the rates of transformation of anilines induced by the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical were an order of magnitude smaller than for the phenolic target compounds this was interpreted as a reduction of the radical intermediates back to the parent compound by the superoxide radical anion laser flash photolysis measurements confirmed the formation of the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical in solutions containing 2 acetonaphthone and 4 cyanophenol and yielded values of 2 6 5 3 108 m 1 s 1 for the second order rate constant for the reaction of this radical with 2 4 6 trimethylphenol these and further results indicate that electron poor model phenoxyl radicals generated through photosensitized oxidation are useful models to understand the photoreactivity of llpo as part of the cdom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

supplementary information document a complex mixture of organic compounds ubiquitous in surface waters leenheer and croué 2003 zark and dittmar 2018 is a key player in the sunlight induced transformation of trace organic contaminants in the aquatic environment under sunlight the chromophoric fraction of dom cdom generates photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppri which can initiate the transformation of contaminants and thus contribute to their degradation richard and canonica 2005 vione et al 2014 besides well studied short lived ppri such as the excited triplet states of cdom 3cdom mcneill and canonica 2016 or singlet oxygen 1o2 ossola et al 2021 long lived photooxidants llpo having lifetimes in the order of 10 4 s have been proposed to occur upon irradiation of cdom and to be relevant for the phototransformation of electron rich contaminants in surface waters canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 remke et al 2021 the hypothesis that llpo occur concomitantly with 3cdom was able to explain the enhancement in cdom photosensitized transformation of electron rich phenols anilines and phenylureas when reducing their initial concentration from 5 μm down to 0 1 μm the reason for this concentration dependence is that the target compound tc e g an electron rich phenol at higher concentrations significantly affects the lifetime of llpo this leads to a lower steady state concentration of llpo at the higher tc concentrations with consequently lower pseudo first order transformation rate constant of the tc in a recent study remke et al 2021 we demonstrated that the effect of llpo was correlated to the phenolic content of dom and successfully tested a model system consisting of a model photosensitizer and a model electron poor phenol to mimic the llpo effect remke et al 2021 these results supported the hypothesis that llpo comprise dom derived phenoxyl radicals whose precursors are electron poor phenolic moieties of the dom an important open question about llpo model systems is related to the suitability of well defined phenoxyl radicals to represent llpo this translates in identifying phenoxyl radicals with a sufficiently high reactivity with the above mentioned electron rich compounds to date a single phenoxyl radical namely the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical 4 cn pho has been investigated using 3 4 dimethoxyphenol dmop as a well studied llpo probe compound remke et al 2021 photochemically produced 4 cn pho was also shown to induce the oxidation of antimony iii and arsenic iii species buschmann et al 2005a buschmann et al 2005b while phenoxyl radical was found to be unreactive toward antimony iii second order rate constants for the reaction of various compounds with phenoxyl radicals which are important oxidation intermediates of phenolic compounds in chemical and biological systems have been determined over decades with methods such as e g laser flash photolysis or pulse radiolysis neta and grodkowski 2005 however for electron rich compounds showing an llpo effect remke et al 2021 rate constants in circumneutral aqueous solution are not available an exception is the water soluble vitamin e analogue 6 hydroxy 2 5 7 8 tetramethylchroman 2 carboxylic acid trolox for which values up to 4 1 108 m 1s 1 were reported neta and grodkowski 2005 it is plausible to assume that the reactivity of phenoxyl radicals with a substrate correlates with the one electron reduction potential e red 1 0 of the phenoxyl radicals li and hoffman 1999 lind et al 1990 steenken and neta 2003 for basic aqueous solutions of various phenols the second order rate constants for the reactions between phenoxyl radicals and phenoxide ions were shown to be 2 109 m 1s 1 furthermore a marcus relationship was obtained when they were plotted against the gibbs free energy of the corresponding one electron transfer reaction canonica and tratnyek 2003 based on these previous observations such rate constants for a given tc are expected to increase with e red 1 0 of the phenoxyl radicals and level off when e red 1 0 approaches the one electron reduction potential of the tc tc couple with such a model in mind the selectivity of phenoxyl radicals reacting with tcs is expected to decrease with increasing e red 1 0 in the present study the transformation kinetics of electron rich model phenols and anilines as tcs was investigated by steady state irradiation of aerated aqueous solutions containing in addition to the tc a model photosensitizer and an electron poor phenol as model phenoxyl radical precursor several electron poor phenols were used to generate phenoxyl radicals with various reduction potentials and the ability of these radicals to represent llpo was assessed in addition laser flash photolysis was utilized to clarify the photosensitized formation and decay of the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical 4 cn pho in the presence of selected tcs and to determine the second order rate constant for the quenching of

cm was obtained from an arium pro ultrapure water system sartorius ag göttingen germany except for laser flash photolysis experiments for details see text s1 si for all compounds stock solutions of appropriate concentrations were prepared in ultrapure water except for 2 acetonaphthone for which a 40 60 v v acetonitrile water mixture was utilized the maximum concentration of acetonitrile in irradiated solutions was always lower than 2 v v in nanosecond laser flash photolysis and lower than 0 2 v v in steady state irradiation experiments and assumed to have no significant effect on the studied reactions 2 2 photosensitized formation of electron poor phenoxyl radicals in a previous study remke et al 2021 solutions containing a photosensitizer 2 an and an electron poor phenol 4 cyanophenol were employed as surrogates for cdom solutions to produce under irradiation on the one hand excited triplet states of the photosensitizer 3sens as models for 3cdom and on the other hand an electron poor phenoxyl radical as model for llpo such a model system and its analogy to cdom is represented in fig 1 the two employed aromatic ketone photosensitizers 2 an and cbbp see a above were chosen due to the suitability of their excited triplet states to model 3cdom canonica et al 1995 carena et al 2019 moreover the e red 1 0 values of 3sens for these two model photosensitizers i e 1 34 and 1 84 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she respectively represent a lower and upper limit respectively for the estimated range of one electron reduction potentials of 3cdom mcneill and canonica 2016 the five electron poor phenols r phohep see b above were selected to confirm the enhancement effect on tc transformation previously observed using 4 cyanophenol and to test in particular the lower limit of the range of e red 1 0 estimated for llpo i e 1 0 1 3 v vs she remke et al 2021 these phenols are represented in fig 2 a together with e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep of the corresponding phenoxyl radicals r phoep covering the range of 0 85 1 12 v vs she see text s4 and table s2b si for details also represented in fig 2a is the fraction of phenoxide r phoep f r pho ep at ph 8 0 since this is an important parameter for the formation of r phoep from the reaction of 3sens with the phenols as illustrated in fig 2b the formation of r phoep from undissociated phenols and phenoxides can be described by eqs 1 2 and 3 respectively 1 3sens r phohep sens r phohep 2 r phohep r phoep h 3 3sens r phoep sens r phoep the reaction of excited triplet aromatic ketones with phenols canonica et al 2000 and phenoxides das and bhattacharyya 1981 has been shown to consist of a rate determining single electron transfer eqs 1 and 3 respectively therefore a diffusion controlled reaction for the undissociated phenols is expected when e red 1 0 3sens e red 1 0 r phohep r phohep and for the phenoxides when e red 1 0 3sens e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep canonica et al 2000 fig 2b shows that the excited triplet state of cbbp 3cbbp fulfils this condition for all studied undissociated phenols and phenoxides but the excited triplet state of 2 an 32 an fulfils the condition only for phenoxides therefore the production rate of electron poor phenoxyl radicals from reaction with 32 an is expected to positively correlate with f r pho ep 2 3 steady state irradiation experiments aqueous solutions 16 ml containing 5 0 mm phosphate buffer ph 8 0 0 1 and appropriate concentrations of a photosensitizer an electron poor phenol and a target compound were prepared in ultrapure water and transferred to quartz tubes 18 mm external diameter and 15 mm internal diameter prior to irradiation the tubes were placed in a water bath for 15 min at 25 c irradiation experiments were conducted as described in detail elsewhere remke et al 2021 briefly the quartz tubes containing the experimental solutions were irradiated in a temperature controlled 25 0 0 2 c merry go round photoreactor equipped with a medium pressure mercury lamp placed in a borosilicate cooling jacket at the center of the reactor the tubes were immersed in a filter solution containing 0 15 m sodium nitrate which combined with the cooling jacket absorbed all light of wavelength λ 320 nm during irradiations which lasted overall between 3 and 36 min seven aliquots 360 μl of solution were withdrawn from the quartz tubes at equidistant time intervals during the irradiation the photon fluence rate in the tubes was determined weekly using the 4 nitroanisole pyridine chemical actinometer as described elsewhere leresche et al 2016 the photon fluence rate in the wavelength band of 334 436 nm varied in the range of 4 4 5 6 10 3 einstein m 2 s 1 over the duration of this study calculations according to laszakovits et al 2017 leresche et al 2016 text s2 si pseudo first order rate constants k obs s 1 for the transformation of a tc were obtained by linear regression as the slope of natural logarithmic concentration

determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using an agilent 1100 hplc system equipped with uv vis absorbance and fluorescence detection typically for samples taken from experiments with 1 µm initial target compound concentration the uv vis absorbance detector was employed while for samples with submicromolar initial concentrations the fluorescence detector was often applied because

and one of the five selected electron poor phenols followed first order kinetics the corresponding pseudo first order rate constants k obs note that in this paper k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs are used to designate the rate constants for the initial tc concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm respectively for the investigated different combinations of tc photosensitizer and electron poor phenol are shown in fig 3 for values see tables s4a and s4b si the concentrations of the photosensitizers and electron poor phenols were also monitored during these irradiation experiments and found to remain unchanged within the analytical uncertainty 5 during the time span for the determination of k 0 1 obs a limited decrease in the concentration of these components 15 over 30 min was found for experiments used to determine k 5 0 obs which can be considered as negligible compared to the variation in photon fluence rate section 2 3 in general much higher k 0 1 obs values were obtained compared to k 5 0 obs using the kinetic considerations about llpo mentioned in the introduction and explained in detail in our previous studies canonica and hoigné 1995 canonica and freiburghaus 2001 remke et al 2021 this enhancement is interpreted as being due to long lived reactive species formed in the presence of electron poor phenols the involved species are presumably the corresponding electron poor phenoxyl radicals a previous kinetic analysis of the system dmop 2 an 4 cyanophenol revealed that at 5 0 μm initial dmop concentration only 14 of the observed dmop transformation was due to 4 cn pho while for an initial dmop concentration of 0 1 μm this fraction increased to 89 remke et al 2021 which supports the present interpretation moreover k 5 0 obs values for each tc photosensitizer combination were low and not significantly affected by the presence of electron poor phenol confirming the assumption that at an initial tc concentration of 5 0 μm tc transformation is primarily due to 3sens while electron poor phenoxyl radicals play a minor role for the investigated combinations of tcs and electron poor phenols a series of control irradiation experiments was performed using solutions that contained no photosensitizer the k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs values obtained from these experiments named k 0 1 control obs and k 5 0 control obs respectively see table s4a si were at least one order of magnitude smaller than for solutions containing 2 an except for the pair dmop 0 1 μm 4 hydroxybenzoic acid only factor of 4 6 smaller compared to solutions containing cbbp k obs values from control experiments were also clearly smaller but the differences were less important for the pairs dmop 0 1 μm 4 hydroxybenzoic acid factor of 2 8 smaller and dmop 0 1 μm 4 hydroxyacetophenone factor of 3 3 smaller this suggests that for these two electron poor phenols a secondary photochemical process besides eqs 1 3 generates the corresponding phenoxyl radicals we propose that this secondary source of phenoxyl radicals is caused by photoionization of the corresponding phenoxides eq 4 since their uv absorption spectra fig s3 si overlap with the spectrum of uv light in the photoreactor 4 r phoep hν r phoep e aq to explore possible correlations of k obs with molecular parameters of the electron poor phenols such as e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep or f r pho ep it is convenient to consider exclusively the contribution to tc transformation due to electron poor phenoxyl radicals produced according to eqs 1 3 this is done by subtracting the corresponding values obtained from control experiments k 0 1 control obs from the original k 0 1 obs values which eliminates the contribution of eq 4 to k obs in addition the k obs values for an initial tc concentration of 5 0 μm for irradiated solution with photosensitizer but without electron poor phenol k 5 0 sens obs should be subtracted which eliminates the contribution of 3sens to k obs no correction was made to compensate for direct photolysis of tc since this was negligible data in table s4a si the values for these corrected rate constants k r pho ep obs c k 0 1 obs k 0 1 control obs k 5 0 sens obs are also displayed in tables s4a and s4b si to carry out this data analysis first the data for the cbbp photosensitized transformation of dmop in the presence of various electron poor phenols were considered fig 3a as shown in fig 4 a the corrected pseudo first order rate constants k r pho ep obs c exhibited a significant positive and linear correlation to e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep with coefficient of determination r2 0 93 details of the linear regression are provided in table s4f si k r pho ep obs c increased by a factor of 6 over a reduction potential span of 0 3 v for this data set it can be assumed that 3cbbp reacts with all of the electron poor phenols independent of the speciation of the latter at approximately the same rate which should be close to a diffusion controlled reaction section 2 2 for any of the electron poor phenols the phenoxyl radical yield may be safely assumed to be close to unity as previously observed for a variety of substituted phenols das and bhattacharyya 1981 this results in a phenoxyl radical production rate that is independent of the employed electron poor phenol therefore the increase in k r pho ep obs c as a function of the e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep is mainly attributed to the increased reactivity of the phenoxyl radicals with the tc in this case dmop which qualitatively fulfils the expectation since 2 an should be capable of oxidizing all studied phenoxides but not their corresponding undissociated phenols see fig 2b k r pho ep obs c values for the 2 an photosensitized transformation of dmop derived from fig 3b are expected to be affected by both e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep as seen above with cbbp and f r ph o ep to factor out the dependence of k r pho ep obs c on e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep we assumed it to be identical as in the above case with cbbp consequently k r pho ep obs c values obtained with 2 an were divided by those obtained with cbbp these k r pho ep obs c ratios i e k r pho ep obs c sens 2 an k r pho ep obs c sens cbbp are represented in fig 4b they are linearly and positively correlated r2 0 88 to f r pho ep calculated according to the details provided in text s4 and in table s3c si in the case of 4 cn phoh these results concur with the observed ph dependence of the transformation kinetics of this phenol photosensitized by 2 an wenk et al 2021 the set of k r pho ep obs c data obtained for dmop and tmp with 2 an as a photosensitizer figs 4c and 3a b for uncorrected data were compared to obtain information about the selectivity of the various r phoep in their reaction with these two phenolic tcs the ratio of k r pho ep obs c values obtained for dmop and tmp respectively i e k r pho ep obs c tc dmop k r pho ep obs c tc tmp fig 4c decreases linearly r2 0 96 with e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep from 13 at 0 85 v to 2 at 1 12 v indicating a marked loss in selectivity of r phoep with increasing e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep the higher reactivity of dmop compared to tmp is due to the lower tendency of tmp to undergo oxidation corresponding to a higher reduction potential of the couple tmp tmp compared to dmop dmop see si table 3a note that the value of the k r pho ep obs c ratio for 4 hydroxybenzoic acid the lowest point in fig 4c is considered as an outlier explainable by a high relative error due to the small measured rate constants since k r pho ep obs c values for dmop are always higher than for tmp except for the mentioned outlier one can also infer that for any studied r phoep the second order rate constant for their reaction with tmp must be lower than the limiting value of a diffusion controlled reaction 3 2 transformation of 2 4 6 trimethylphenol and aniline induced by the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical the characterization of the llpo model system using 2 an as a photosensitizer and 4 cyanophenol as a phenoxyl radical precursor accomplished for dmop in a preceding study remke et al 2021 was extended here to other tcs tmp and aniline first irradiation experiments were performed at initial tc concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm with various concentrations of 4 cyanophenol in the range of 0 10 μm the corresponding k obs are presented in fig 5 a b see also fig s4 si during each kinetic run the concentrations of 2 acetonaphthone and 4 cyanophenol remained almost constant 5 with 0 1 μm initial concentration and 15 with 5 0 μm initial concentration fig s5 si moreover no correction for direct photolysis was necessary for these k obs data due to the minor transformation rates measured in the absence of 2 an table s4a si consistently for both tcs k 0 1 obs was observed to increase linearly with 4 cyanophenol concentration while k 5 0 obs was not affected significantly by the presence of 4 cyanophenol furthermore several irradiation experiments were conducted at various initial tc concentrations between 0 1 and 5 0 μm the corresponding k obs plotted as a function of the initial tc concentration fig 5c d exhibit a hyperbolic decrease as already observed for dmop remke et al 2021 despite the mentioned similarities there are several differences in the k obs trends for tmp and aniline a first difference concerns the slope of the line k obs as a function of 4 cn phoh fig 5a b which is about 10 times smaller for aniline than for tmp this difference in the slope could be due to either a slower electron transfer reaction between 4 cn pho and aniline compared to tmp or a less efficient transformation of the formed aniline radical cation to an oxidation product compared to the tmp phenoxyl radical aniline radicals or radical cations are known to undergo back reduction in the presence of antioxidants to form the original compound which results in a decrease in their transformation rates wenk and canonica 2012 leresche et al 2020 in the present experiments the superoxide radical anion o2 which according to scheme 1 is formed during the irradiation of a photosensitizer such as 2 an in the presence of an electron donor such as the 4 cyanophenoxide ion tmp and aniline in the present experiments could play the antioxidant role by reducing the aniline radical thereby contributing to a lower transformation rate of aniline a second important difference is that for aniline and 4 methylaniline fig s7 si k 5 0 obs k 0 1 obs for 4 cyanophenol concentrations below 2 μm whereas for tmp k 5 0 obs k 0 1 obs for any 4 cyanophenol concentration in particular in the absence of 4 cyanophenol k 5 0 obs 7 k 0 1 obs this is not explainable based on the kinetic model of fig 1 which would predict a pseudo first order rate constant independent of initial tc concentration see discussion below this anomaly in the photosensitized transformation of aniline might be due to aniline radical phnh coupling reactions of the type described in eq 5 which would compete with the back reduction process leading to a faster aniline transformation higher k obs with increasing phnh and therefore with increasing aniline concentration 5 phnh phnh phn 2 the occurrence of such coupling reactions leading to the formation of azobenzenes was found for the transformation of anilines photosensitized by different humic substances zepp et al 1981 and for the oxidation of anilines by manganese dioxide laha and luthy 1990 the aforementioned hyperbolic decrease in k obs with increasing initial concentration of tmp and aniline in irradiated solutions containing 2 an and 4 cyanophenol 5 μm fig 5c d was modeled using a previously developed relationship eq 6 remke et al 2021 6 k tc obs k 3 2 an tc obs β 4 cn pho tc r tc 0 where k tc obs is the pseudo first order rate constant for tc abatement k 3 2 an tc obs is the direct contribution of the reaction of tc with the excited triplet state of 2 an to k tc obs and β 4 cn pho tc r tc 0 is the contribution of the reaction of tc with the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical to k tc obs the parameter β 4 cn pho tc r being an inverse proportionality factor non linear fits of k tc obs vs tc 0 according to eq 6 are summarized in table 1 the second term of the k tc obs calculation in eq 6 can also be expressed as 7 β 4 cn pho tc r tc 0 k 4 cn pho tc r 4 cn pho ss where k 4 cn pho tc r is the second order rate constant for the reaction of tc with 4 cn pho leading to the transformation of tc and 4 cn pho ss is the steady state concentration of 4 cn pho in turn 4 cn pho ss can be expressed as the ratio of the rate of its formation r 4 cn pho f and the first order rate constant for its decay we assume that for tmp and dmop experiments these compounds are the only scavengers of 4 cn pho present in solution and that their reaction with tc leads to the transformation of tc with a yield of one in this case the following equation holds 8 4 cn pho ss r 4 cn pho f k 4 cn pho tc r tc 0 substituting eq 8 into eq 7 and multiplying both sides by tc 0 yields eq 9 9 β 4 cn pho tc r r 4 cn pho f these calculations provided the above assumptions regarding the transformation of tc and the scavenging of 4 cn pho are valid are able to explain why β 4 cn pho tc r does not depend on tc β 4 cn pho dmop r β 4 cn pho tmp r and corresponds to the rate of formation of 4 cn pho for the case of tmp and dmop when comparing the diagrams of tmp and aniline fig 5c d it is evident that k obs for aniline cover a much narrower range than for tmp this is reflected in β 4 cn pho aniline r which is more than one order of magnitude lower than β 4 cn pho dmop r and β 4 cn pho tmp r this is a direct consequence of the observations displayed in fig 5b and thoroughly discussed above despite a good data fit to eq 6 aniline cannot be used to estimate r 4 cn ph o f because its transformation is most probably inhibited by the superoxide radical anion as discussed in a recent study wenk et al 2021 in addition aniline transformation is accelerated at higher concentrations as explained before therefore eq 9 is not valid in the case of aniline 3 3 quenching of the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical by target compounds laser flash photolysis experiments were performed primarily to determine second order rate constants for the quenching of electron poor phenoxyl radicals by phenols and anilines the reaction scheme applicable to these experiments is the same as for the photosensitized transformation of a tc in the presence of an electron poor phenol fig 1b upper part because of the intrinsic difficulty of the experiments which are impaired by spectral overlap of the various transient species in particular r phoep and tc experimental series were restricted to the study of the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical the latter is the main radical investigated in this and a previous study remke et al 2021 and it exhibits a characteristic absorption band with a narrow maximum at 436 nm bronner and wenger 2012 d alessandro et al 2000 the primary selected tc was tmp because of the minor interference caused by absorption of its phenoxyl radical transient absorption spectra obtained by laser flash photolysis of an aerated aqueous solution ph 8 0 containing 2 an 150 μm 4 cyanophenol 2 mm in the absence or presence of tmp 250 μm are shown in fig 6 a or b respectively fig s9 si represents the simulated regime of transients in this mixture at a very short delay time 50 ns after the laser pulse the transient spectra mainly represent the absorption of 32 an maximum at 440 nm with a small peak at 436 nm corresponding to 4 cn pho with increasing delay time the absorption of 4 cn pho becomes clearer and persists in the absence of tmp fig 6a while the absorption of 32 an strongly decreases and finally disappears the band at about 390 nm see 2 μs delay spectrum is attributed to the ketyl radical or radical anion of 2 an resulting through the electron transfer from 4 cn pho to 32 an and disappears at long delay times mainly due to reaction with oxygen to yield superoxide radical ion bryce and wells 1963 in the presence of tmp fig 6b the 4 cn pho peak at 436 nm grows until intermediate delay times then decreases and finally disappears after 50 μs while a new peak appears at 395 nm after 10 μs which persists at least up to 50 μs this peak is attributed to the phenoxyl radical of tmp which is formed by the reaction of 4 cn pho with tmp the just described temporal sequence of species is analogous to the one observed in a previous study about the radical cation of 4 dimethylamino benzonitrile and its reaction with phenols and various types of dom leresche et al 2020 a kinetic model of the main transients formed in the presence of tmp supports this assignment text s5 and fig s9 si data obtained using lfp 1 time delays after the laser pulse are indicated in the diagrams the excitation wavelength was 355 nm for all of the spectra samples were buffered at ph 8 with phosphate buffer 20 mm the rate of 4 cn pho decay was observed to increase with increasing concentration of the added tmp see the corresponding absorption traces measured at 436 nm figs s14 and s15 si fitting the decay traces to a single exponential function with a constant offset yielded first order rate constants that increased with increasing tmp concentration fig 7 b first we consider the value of the first order decay rate constant of 4 cn pho in the absence of tmp i e for tmp 0 which is close to 2 5 104 s 1 this value corresponds to a lifetime of 40 μs for 4 cn pho under the present laser flash photolysis experimental conditions the lifetime of 4 cn pho under the conditions used for steady state irradiation is probably significantly higher than this since the concentration of reactive radical species that could contribute to its quenching such as 4 cn pho itself sens and o2 is much lower consequently 4 cn pho is a long lived species compared to the excited triplet state of any photosensitizer in aerated aqueous solution and is appropriate from this point of view as an llpo surrogate second linear regression lines of the aforementioned first order rate constants fig 7b were used to determine the second order rate constant for the quenching of 4 cn pho by tmp k 4 cn pho tmp q values of k 4 cn pho tmp q of 2 6 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 and 5 3 0 1 108 m 1 s 1 for measurements performed using the instruments lfp 1 and lfp 2 respectively were obtained an experimental series performed using deuterated water as a solvent and lfp 1 yielded k 4 cn pho tmp q 1 68 0 09 108 m 1 s 1 from which a deuterium isotope effect of 1 5 0 3 was derived this suggests that a proton either from the solvent or from the phenolic functional group of tmp is involved in the rate determining step of the reaction between 4 cn pho and tmp open and filled symbols represent two distinct measurement series performed using the same equipment orange squares and rate constants data obtained using lfp 1 dark brown triangles and rate constants data obtained using lfp 2 excitation wavelength was 355 nm for all of the measurements samples were buffered at ph 8 with phosphate buffer 20 mm the reason why two significantly different k 4 cn pho tmp q values using different instruments were obtained could be due to the different signal intensities which were higher for lfp 2 than for lfp 1 taking the higher value of 5 3 0 1 108 m 1 s 1 as a limit for a higher estimate one can definitely state that it is much lower than typical diffusion controlled rate constants for the reaction of phenoxyl radicals with electron donors i e 4 109 m 1 s 1 neta and grodkowski 2005 this conclusion matches with the prediction made in section 3 1 about the magnitude of k 4 cn pho tmp q unfortunately for dmop the determination of the corresponding rate constant was not possible because of the superposition of the uv vis absorption bands of the dmop phenoxl radical and 4 cn pho in view of the conclusions of section 3 1 and the lower value of e red 1 0 for dmop compared to tmp it is very likely that k 4 cn ph o dmop q k 4 cn p ho tm p q analogous laser flash photolysis experiments were performed using aniline and 4 methylaniline as target compounds in solution containing 2 an as a photosensitizer and 4 cn phoh as an electron poor phenol the formation of the corresponding aniline radicals or radical cations could be observed fig s8 c f si however the determination of second order rate constant for the reaction of 4 cn pho with these anilines was not successful due to strong spectral overlap caused by these radicals additional experiments were performed to determine second order rate constants for the quenching of 32 an by the 4 cyanophenol fig 7a aniline and 4 methylaniline 4 ma table 2 the transient absorption decay traces of 32 an measured at 440 450 nm were fitted to single exponential functions to obtain the corresponding first order quenching rate constants figs s11 13 si the latter were then plotted against quencher concentration to determine second order rate constants as the slope of the corresponding linear regression lines the rate constants for the quenching of triplet state 2 acetonaphtone are summarized in table 2 fig s10 si the values determined for 4 cyanophenol with the two different laser flash photolysis instruments are identical within experimental error and lead to an average value of k 3 2 a n 4 cn phoh q 3 3 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 measured at ph 8 0 fig 7a assuming that quenching is due exclusively to the 4 cyanophenoxide ion and considering the speciation of 4 cyanophenol the quenching rate constant for the 4 cyanophenoxide ion can be estimated as k 3 2 an 4 cn ph o q 6 6 0 6 108 m 1 s 1 this value is about half of the value that can be extrapolated from a previous less precise rate constant determined at ph 6 0 canonica et al 2000 for the anilines second order quenching rate constants are not far from the diffusion controlled limit but about 30 lower compared to corresponding values previously measured for dmop and trolox canonica et al 2000 and within the range of values determined for the quenching of the excited triplet state of methylene blue by various anilines at ph 8 4 erickson et al 2015 4 environmental implications the motivation of this study was to characterize the still elusive dom derived long lived photooxidants llpo and to test the hypothesis that they may consist of electron poor phenoxyl radicals the applied model systems to mimic llpo were solutions containing a model photosensitizer and an electron poor phenol irradiation experiments were performed under the same conditions as many previous experiments using cdom as a source of photooxidants thereby electron poor phenoxyl radicals were produced which were observed to induce the transformation of typical target compounds subject to llpo effect all investigated electron poor phenoxyl radicals having reduction potentials in the range of 0 85 1 12 v vs she lead to a significant enhancement in the photosensitized transformation of the llpo probe compounds dmop and tmp this fact suggests that the lower limit of e red 1 0 of dom derived llpo might be lower than the previously estimated value of 1 0 v remke et al 2021 moreover the determined second order rate constant for the reaction of tmp with 4 cn pho 4 1 108 m 1 s 1 was well below the diffusion controlled limit for the other studied phenoxyl radicals having lower e red 1 0 values compared to the 4 cn pho lower rate constants for their reaction with tmp are expected therefore having second order rate constants near the diffusion controlled limit does not appear to be required for an enhancement of the phototransformation of llpo probe compounds under steady state irradiation due to the presence of phenoxyl radicals in conclusion the estimation of e red 1 0 of llpo based on the oxidation potentials of probe compounds remke et al 2021 and on e red 1 0 values of model oxidants in the present study electron poor phenoxyl radicals is not straightforward and needs further investigation the formation pathways of llpo during irradiation of cdom are still unknown one possible pathway which was modelled in the present study assumes llpo to be formed by reaction of 3sens as a surrogate for 3cdom with electron poor phenols using 3cbbp and 32 an as 3cdom surrogates with high and low e red 1 0 respectively two different behaviors in the effect of electron poor phenoxyl radicals on phenolic tcs transformation were observed 1 with 3cbbp an increase in phototransformation that was related to an increase in e red 1 0 of the electron poor phenoxyl radicals with an assumed uniform production rate of all these radicals and 2 with 32 an an increase in phototransformation that was mainly related to an increase of the degree of deprotonation of the electron poor phenols since e red 1 0 of 3cdom spans a wide range covering the values for 3cbbp and 32 an both of the above behaviors are expected to occur concomitantly in irradiated cdom solution the contribution of a 32 an like behavior agrees with the observed increase of the llpo effect with increasing ph canonica and freiburghaus 2001 such a ph effect would also be compatible with direct photoionization of phenoxides as electron poor phenoxyl radical source see eq 4 since phenoxides have increased light absorption fig s3 si and photoionization quantum yields compared to the corresponding undissociated phenols grabner et al 1977 both effects lead to increased rates of phenoxyl radical production from phenoxides compared to phenols transformation rates of aniline and 4 methylaniline due to reaction with 4 cn pho were observed to be much lower than the corresponding rates for tmp and dmop this would suggest a reduced importance of llpo in the phototransformation of anilines compared to electron rich phenols also for model systems with 32 an and 4 cn pho as model photooxidants the enhancement of aniline transformation by reducing the initial concentration of aniline from 5 0 to 0 1 μm was much smaller than for the phenolic tcs this effect attributed to a complex behavior in the photosensitized transformation of the anilines which appears to be influenced by autocatalysis in the studied initial concentration range is able to explain the low enhancement factors observed using suwannee river fulvic acid as source of 3cdom and llpo remke et al 2021 moreover these observations suggest that indirect phototransformation kinetics of anilines should be measured at very low concentrations 0 1 μm to make accurate predictions on the fate of anilines in sunlit surface waters 5 conclusions in this study target compound transformation mediated by various photochemically produced electron poor phenoxyl radicals was investigated the transformation of the electron rich compounds 3 4 dimethoxyphenol and 2 4 6 trimethylphenol aniline and 4 methylaniline was monitored in aqueous solutions of dom model systems each consisting of an aromatic ketone as photosensitizer and an electron poor phenol as llpo precursor for a low initial concentration 0 1 μm of the target compounds higher transformation rate constants were observed compared to a higher initial concentration 5 0 μm confirming the involvement of long lived reactive species assumed to be photochemically produced electron poor phenoxyl radicals with increasing e red 1 0 of the employed phenoxyl radicals faster transformations of phenolic target compounds were observed while the selectivity of the phenoxyl radicals decreased the formation rate of phenoxyl radicals from electron poor phenols was shown to be controlled by both the one electron reduction potential of the excited triplet state of the photosensitizer and the fraction of the electron poor phenoxide the rates of aniline and 4 methylaniline transformation induced by photochemically produced 4 cyanophenoxyl radical were significantly lower than for the transformation of phenolic target compounds this is interpreted as an indication that transformation of anilines is probably hampered by back reduction of their radical oxidation intermediates through reductants primarily the superoxide radical ion the second order rate constant for the quenching of 4 cyanophenoxyl radical by 2 4 6 trimethylphenol in aqueous solution was determined as 4 1 108 m 1s 1 the moderate but significant deuterium isotope effect for this rate constant 1 5 indicates a proton coupled electron transfer in the rate determining step of the reaction the results of this study are crucial to understand the nature of llpo generated by irradiation of cdom solutions for instance they enabled an estimation of reduction potentials of llpo and provided possible explanations for the previously observed ph dependence of the llpo effect and low enhancement factors for anilines in irradiated cdom solutions funding this study was supported by the swiss national

16238,reactive intermediates formed upon irradiation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom contribute to the degradation of various organic contaminants in surface waters besides well studied short lived photooxidants such as triplet state cdom 3cdom or singlet oxygen cdom derived long lived photooxidants llpo have been suggested as key players in the transformation of electron rich contaminants llpo were hypothesized to mainly consist of phenoxyl radicals derived from phenolic moieties in the cdom to test this hypothesis and to better characterize llpo the transformation kinetics of selected target compounds phenols and anilines induced by a suite of electron poor model phenoxyl radicals was studied in aerated aqueous solution at ph 8 the phenoxyl radicals were generated by photosensitized oxidation of the parent phenols using aromatic ketones as photosensitizers under steady state irradiation the presence of any of the electron poor phenols lead to an enhanced abatement of the phenolic target compounds at an initial concentration of 1 0 10 7 m compared to solutions containing the photosensitizer but no electron poor phenol a trend of increasing reactivity with increasing one electron reduction potential of the electron poor phenoxyl radical range 0 85 1 12 v vs standard hydrogen electrode was observed using the excited triplet state of 2 acetonaphthone as a selective oxidant for phenols it was observed that the reactivity correlated with the concentration of electron poor phenoxide present in solution the rates of transformation of anilines induced by the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical were an order of magnitude smaller than for the phenolic target compounds this was interpreted as a reduction of the radical intermediates back to the parent compound by the superoxide radical anion laser flash photolysis measurements confirmed the formation of the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical in solutions containing 2 acetonaphthone and 4 cyanophenol and yielded values of 2 6 5 3 108 m 1 s 1 for the second order rate constant for the reaction of this radical with 2 4 6 trimethylphenol these and further results indicate that electron poor model phenoxyl radicals generated through photosensitized oxidation are useful models to understand the photoreactivity of llpo as part of the cdom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

cdom and to be relevant for the phototransformation of electron rich contaminants in surface waters canonica and freiburghaus 2001 canonica and hoigné 1995 remke et al 2021 the hypothesis that llpo occur concomitantly with 3cdom was able to explain the enhancement in cdom photosensitized transformation of electron rich phenols anilines and phenylureas when reducing their initial concentration from 5 μm down to 0 1 μm the reason for this concentration dependence is that the target compound tc e g an electron rich phenol at higher concentrations significantly affects the lifetime of llpo this leads to a lower steady state concentration of llpo at the higher tc concentrations with consequently lower pseudo first order transformation rate constant of the tc in a recent study remke et al 2021 we demonstrated that the effect of llpo was correlated to the phenolic content of dom and successfully tested a model system consisting of a model photosensitizer and a model electron poor phenol to mimic the llpo effect remke et al 2021 these results supported the hypothesis that llpo comprise dom derived phenoxyl radicals whose precursors are electron poor phenolic moieties of the dom an important open question about llpo model systems is related to the suitability of well defined phenoxyl radicals to represent llpo this translates in identifying phenoxyl radicals with a sufficiently high reactivity with the above mentioned electron rich compounds to date a single phenoxyl radical namely the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical 4 cn pho has been investigated using 3 4 dimethoxyphenol dmop as a well studied llpo probe compound remke et al 2021 photochemically produced 4 cn pho was also shown to induce the oxidation of antimony iii and arsenic iii species buschmann et al 2005a buschmann et al 2005b while phenoxyl radical was found to be unreactive toward antimony iii second order rate constants for the reaction of various compounds with phenoxyl radicals which are important oxidation intermediates of phenolic compounds in chemical and biological systems have been determined over decades with methods such as e g laser flash photolysis or pulse radiolysis neta and grodkowski 2005 however for electron rich compounds showing an llpo effect remke et al 2021 rate constants in circumneutral aqueous solution are not available an exception is the water soluble vitamin e analogue 6 hydroxy 2 5 7 8 tetramethylchroman 2 carboxylic acid trolox for which values up to 4 1 108 m 1s 1 were reported neta and grodkowski 2005 it is plausible to assume that the reactivity of phenoxyl radicals with a substrate correlates with the one electron reduction potential e red 1 0 of the phenoxyl radicals li and hoffman 1999 lind et al 1990 steenken and neta 2003 for basic aqueous solutions of various phenols the second order rate constants for the reactions between phenoxyl radicals and phenoxide ions were shown to be 2 109 m 1s 1 furthermore a marcus relationship was obtained when they were plotted against the gibbs free energy of the corresponding one electron transfer reaction canonica and tratnyek 2003 based on these previous observations such rate constants for a given tc are expected to increase with e red 1 0 of the phenoxyl radicals and level off when e red 1 0 approaches the one electron reduction potential of the tc tc couple with such a model in mind the selectivity of phenoxyl radicals reacting with tcs is expected to decrease with increasing e red 1 0 in the present study the transformation kinetics of electron rich model phenols and anilines as tcs was investigated by steady state irradiation of aerated aqueous solutions containing in addition to the tc a model photosensitizer and an electron poor phenol as model phenoxyl radical precursor several electron poor phenols were used to generate phenoxyl radicals with various reduction potentials and the ability of these radicals to represent llpo was assessed in addition laser flash photolysis was utilized to clarify the photosensitized formation and decay of the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical 4 cn pho in the presence of selected tcs and to determine the second order rate constant for the quenching of 4 cn pho by tmp 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions the following organic chemicals were used in this study a photosensitizers sens 2 acetonaphthone 2 an and 4 carboxybenzophenone cbbp

methylaniline and 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp d further compounds acetonitrile 4 nitroanisole and pyridine inorganic chemicals used as buffer components comprised boric acid phosphoric acid na2hpo4 2h2o and nah2po4 h2o all chemicals were purchased from common commercial suppliers as detailed in the supplementary information si text s1 and used as received ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was obtained from an arium pro ultrapure water system sartorius ag göttingen germany except for laser flash photolysis experiments for details see text s1 si for all compounds stock solutions of appropriate concentrations were prepared in ultrapure water except for 2 acetonaphthone for which a 40 60 v v acetonitrile water mixture was utilized the maximum concentration of acetonitrile in irradiated solutions was always lower than 2 v v in nanosecond laser flash photolysis and lower than 0 2 v v in steady state irradiation experiments and assumed to have no significant effect on the studied reactions 2 2 photosensitized formation of electron poor phenoxyl radicals in a previous study remke et al 2021 solutions containing a photosensitizer 2 an and an electron poor phenol 4 cyanophenol were employed as surrogates for cdom solutions to produce under irradiation on the one hand excited triplet states of the photosensitizer 3sens as models for 3cdom and on the other hand an electron poor phenoxyl radical as model for llpo such a model system and its analogy to cdom is represented in fig 1 the two employed aromatic ketone photosensitizers 2 an and cbbp see a above were chosen due to the suitability of their excited triplet states to model 3cdom canonica et al 1995 carena et al 2019 moreover the e red 1 0 values of 3sens for these two model photosensitizers i e 1 34 and 1 84 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she respectively represent a lower and upper limit respectively for the estimated range of one electron reduction potentials of 3cdom mcneill and canonica 2016 the five electron poor phenols r phohep see b above were selected to confirm the enhancement effect on tc transformation previously observed using 4 cyanophenol and to test in particular the lower limit of the range of e red 1 0 estimated for llpo i e 1 0 1 3 v vs she remke et al 2021 these phenols are represented in fig 2 a together with e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep of the corresponding phenoxyl radicals r phoep covering the range of 0 85 1 12 v vs she see text s4 and table s2b si for details also represented in fig 2a is the fraction of phenoxide r phoep f r pho ep at ph 8 0 since this is an important parameter for the formation of r phoep from the reaction of 3sens with the phenols as illustrated in fig 2b the formation of r phoep from undissociated phenols and phenoxides can be described by eqs 1 2 and 3 respectively 1 3sens r phohep sens r phohep 2 r phohep r phoep h 3 3sens r phoep sens r phoep the reaction of excited triplet aromatic ketones with phenols canonica et al 2000 and phenoxides das and bhattacharyya 1981 has been shown to consist of a rate determining single electron transfer eqs 1 and 3 respectively therefore a diffusion controlled reaction for the undissociated phenols is expected when e red 1 0 3sens e red 1 0 r phohep r phohep and for the phenoxides when e red 1 0 3sens e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep canonica et al 2000 fig 2b shows that the excited triplet state of cbbp 3cbbp fulfils this condition for all studied undissociated phenols and phenoxides but the excited triplet state of 2 an 32 an fulfils the condition only for phenoxides therefore the production rate of electron poor phenoxyl radicals from reaction with 32 an is expected to positively correlate with f r pho ep 2 3 steady state irradiation experiments aqueous solutions 16 ml containing 5 0 mm phosphate buffer ph 8 0 0 1 and appropriate concentrations of a photosensitizer an electron poor phenol and a target compound were prepared in ultrapure water and transferred to quartz tubes 18 mm external diameter and 15 mm internal diameter prior to irradiation the tubes were placed in a water bath for 15 min at 25 c irradiation experiments were conducted as described in detail elsewhere remke et al 2021 briefly the quartz tubes containing the experimental solutions were irradiated in a temperature controlled 25 0 0 2 c merry go round photoreactor equipped with a medium pressure mercury lamp placed in a borosilicate cooling jacket at the center of the reactor the tubes were immersed in a filter solution containing 0 15 m sodium nitrate which combined with the cooling jacket absorbed all light of wavelength λ 320 nm during irradiations which lasted overall between 3 and 36 min seven aliquots 360 μl of solution were withdrawn from the quartz tubes at equidistant time intervals during the irradiation the photon fluence rate in the tubes was determined weekly using the 4 nitroanisole pyridine chemical actinometer as described elsewhere leresche et al 2016 the photon fluence rate in the wavelength band of 334 436 nm varied in the range of 4 4 5 6 10 3 einstein m 2 s 1 over the duration of this study calculations according to laszakovits et al 2017 leresche et al 2016 text s2 si pseudo first order rate constants k obs s 1 for the transformation of a tc were obtained by linear regression as the slope of natural logarithmic concentration values of tc versus time no light screening correction was applied due to the negligible absorbance of the investigated solutions at λ 320 nm 2 4 analytical methods compound concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using an agilent 1100 hplc system equipped with uv vis absorbance and fluorescence detection typically for samples taken from experiments with 1 µm initial target compound concentration the uv vis absorbance detector was employed while for samples with submicromolar initial concentrations the fluorescence detector was often applied because higher sensitivity could be achieved for most compounds details on the hplc set up and methods are provided in text s3 and table s2a c si the ph of the samples was measured before and after each irradiation experiment using a ph meter a metrohm model 605 equipped with a metrohm ph electrode model 6 02341 110 a small ph decrease 0 1 ph units was observed during most of the irradiation experiments 2 5 nanosecond laser flash photolysis laser flash photolysis experiments were performed utilizing two distinct instruments described below as lfp 1 and lfp 2 1 lfp 1 an nd yag laser quantel brilliant pulse length 10 ns pulse energy 10 mj energy measured at the cuvette emission wavelength 355 nm with a 2x beam expander from thorlabs was employed to excite an area of 1 1 cm of the samples in a 1 1 4 cm quartz cuvette transient absorption spectra were recorded on an lp 920 ks setup from edinburg instruments equipped with an iccd camera from andor with time integration over 200 ns a photomultiplier tube was used to record kinetic transient absorption traces at single wavelengths experiments were performed at 25 c in a temperature controlled cuvette holder 2 lfp 2 the setup of this equipment is described in detail elsewhere leresche et al 2019 briefly an nd yag laser ekspla model sl334 pulse length 150 ps pulse energy 150 mj measured directly after the laser emission wavelength 355 nm was employed to excite the sample in a 4 1 1 cm quartz cuvette the laser pulse was dispersed using a cylindrical concave lense on one 4 1 cm side of the cuvette transient absorption spectra were recorded using an iccd camera andor istar model dh740i 18u 03 with an overpulsed xenon arc lamp as source of the probe light kinetic transient absorption traces were recorded using the software tekscope on a tektronix digital phosphor oscilloscope model dpo7104c employing a hamamatsu model 928 photomultiplier tube experiments were performed in an air conditioned room at an ambient temperature of 20 1 c the software origin 2019b academic originlab corporation was employed for the data analysis transient absorption spectral data were plotted and absorption bands were ascribed to transient species based on previous observations table s5 si kinetic transient absorption traces were fitted to single exponential decays fitting of kinetic traces of 32 an at 450 or 440 nm was performed using absorbance data typically up to 8 10 μs time delay after the laser pulse to fit kinetic traces of 4 cn pho at 436 nm the fitting range was set to 5 100 or 5 400 μs after the laser pulse to avoid the early signal by 32 an fitting residuals were examined for every trace visually and concluded to be adequate figs s12 17 si the software kintecus ianni 2017 was employed for kinetic simulations to verify the set of assumed reactions occurring after the laser pulse text s5 fig s9 table s6 si 3 results and discussion 3 1 target compound transformation induced by electron poor phenoxyl radicals the photosensitized transformation of the phenolic tcs dmop and tmp measured at initial tc concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm in the presence of either cbbp or 2 an as photosensitizers and one of the five selected electron poor phenols followed first order kinetics the corresponding pseudo first order rate constants k obs note that in this paper k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs are used to designate the rate constants for the initial tc concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm respectively for the investigated different combinations of tc photosensitizer and electron poor phenol are shown in fig 3 for values see tables s4a and s4b si the concentrations of the photosensitizers and electron poor phenols were also monitored during these irradiation experiments and found to remain unchanged within the analytical uncertainty 5 during the time span for the determination of k 0 1 obs a limited decrease in the concentration of these components 15 over 30 min was found for experiments used to determine k 5 0 obs which can be considered as negligible compared to the variation in photon fluence rate section 2 3 in general much higher k 0 1 obs values were obtained compared to k 5 0 obs using the kinetic considerations about llpo mentioned in the introduction and explained in detail in our previous studies canonica and hoigné 1995 canonica and freiburghaus 2001 remke et al 2021 this enhancement is interpreted as being due to long lived reactive species formed in the presence of electron poor phenols the involved species are presumably the corresponding electron poor phenoxyl radicals a previous kinetic analysis of the system dmop 2 an 4 cyanophenol revealed that at 5 0 μm initial dmop concentration only 14 of the observed dmop transformation was due to 4 cn pho while for an initial dmop concentration of 0 1 μm this fraction increased to 89 remke et al 2021 which supports the present interpretation moreover k 5 0 obs values for each tc photosensitizer combination were low and not significantly affected by the presence of electron poor phenol confirming the assumption that at an initial tc concentration of 5 0 μm tc transformation is primarily due to 3sens while electron poor phenoxyl radicals play a minor role for the investigated combinations of tcs and electron poor phenols a series of control irradiation experiments was performed using solutions that contained no photosensitizer the k 0 1 obs and k 5 0 obs values obtained from these experiments named k 0 1 control obs and k 5 0 control obs respectively see table s4a si were at least one order of magnitude smaller than for solutions containing 2 an except for the pair dmop 0 1 μm 4 hydroxybenzoic acid only factor of 4 6 smaller compared to solutions containing cbbp k obs values from control experiments were also clearly smaller but the differences were less important for the pairs dmop 0 1 μm 4 hydroxybenzoic acid factor of 2 8 smaller and dmop 0 1 μm 4 hydroxyacetophenone factor of 3 3 smaller this suggests that for these two electron poor phenols a secondary photochemical process besides eqs 1 3 generates the corresponding phenoxyl radicals we propose that this secondary source of phenoxyl radicals is caused by photoionization of the corresponding phenoxides eq 4 since their uv absorption spectra fig s3 si overlap with the spectrum of uv light in the photoreactor 4 r phoep hν r phoep e aq to explore possible correlations of k obs with molecular parameters of the electron poor phenols such as e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep or f r pho ep it is convenient to consider exclusively the contribution to tc transformation due to electron poor phenoxyl radicals produced according to eqs 1 3 this is done by subtracting the corresponding values obtained from control experiments k 0 1 control obs from the original k 0 1 obs values which eliminates the contribution of eq 4 to k obs in addition the k obs values for an initial tc concentration of 5 0 μm for irradiated solution with photosensitizer but without electron poor phenol k 5 0 sens obs should be subtracted which eliminates the contribution of 3sens to k obs no correction was made to compensate for direct photolysis of tc since this was negligible data in table s4a si the values for these corrected rate constants k r pho ep obs c k 0 1 obs k 0 1 control obs k 5 0 sens obs are also displayed in tables s4a and s4b si to carry out this data analysis first the data for the cbbp photosensitized transformation of dmop in the presence of various electron poor phenols were considered fig 3a as shown in fig 4 a the corrected pseudo first order rate constants k r pho ep obs c exhibited a significant positive and linear correlation to e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep with coefficient of determination r2 0 93 details of the linear regression are provided in table s4f si k r pho ep obs c increased by a factor of 6 over a reduction potential span of 0 3 v for this data set it can be assumed that 3cbbp reacts with all of the electron poor phenols independent of the speciation of the latter at approximately the same rate which should be close to a diffusion controlled reaction section 2 2 for any of the electron poor phenols the phenoxyl radical yield may be safely assumed to be close to unity as previously observed for a variety of substituted phenols das and bhattacharyya 1981 this results in a phenoxyl radical production rate that is independent of the employed electron poor phenol therefore the increase in k r pho ep obs c as a function of the e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep is mainly attributed to the increased reactivity of the phenoxyl radicals with the tc in this case dmop which qualitatively fulfils the expectation since 2 an should be capable of oxidizing all studied phenoxides but not their corresponding undissociated phenols see fig 2b k r pho ep obs c values for the 2 an photosensitized transformation of dmop derived from fig 3b are expected to be affected by both e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep as seen above with cbbp and f r ph o ep to factor out the dependence of k r pho ep obs c on e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep we assumed it to be identical as in the above case with cbbp consequently k r pho ep obs c values obtained with 2 an were divided by those obtained with cbbp these k r pho ep obs c ratios i e k r pho ep obs c sens 2 an k r pho ep obs c sens cbbp are represented in fig 4b they are linearly and positively correlated r2 0 88 to f r pho ep calculated according to the details provided in text s4 and in table s3c si in the case of 4 cn phoh these results concur with the observed ph dependence of the transformation kinetics of this phenol photosensitized by 2 an wenk et al 2021 the set of k r pho ep obs c data obtained for dmop and tmp with 2 an as a photosensitizer figs 4c and 3a b for uncorrected data were compared to obtain information about the selectivity of the various r phoep in their reaction with these two phenolic tcs the ratio of k r pho ep obs c values obtained for dmop and tmp respectively i e k r pho ep obs c tc dmop k r pho ep obs c tc tmp fig 4c decreases linearly r2 0 96 with e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep from 13 at 0 85 v to 2 at 1 12 v indicating a marked loss in selectivity of r phoep with increasing e red 1 0 r phoep r phoep the higher reactivity of dmop compared to tmp is due to the lower tendency of tmp to undergo oxidation corresponding to a higher reduction potential of the couple tmp tmp compared to dmop dmop see si table 3a note that the value of the k r pho ep obs c ratio for 4 hydroxybenzoic acid the lowest point in fig 4c is considered as an outlier explainable by a high relative error due to the small measured rate constants since k r pho ep obs c values for dmop are always higher than for tmp except for the mentioned outlier one can also infer that for any studied r phoep the second order rate constant for their reaction with tmp must be lower than the limiting value of a diffusion controlled reaction 3 2 transformation of 2 4 6 trimethylphenol and aniline induced by the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical the characterization of the llpo model system using 2 an as a photosensitizer and 4 cyanophenol as a phenoxyl radical precursor accomplished for dmop in a preceding study remke et al 2021 was extended here to other tcs tmp and aniline first irradiation experiments were performed at initial tc concentrations of 0 1 and 5 0 μm with various concentrations of 4 cyanophenol in the range of 0 10 μm the corresponding k obs are presented in fig 5 a b see also fig s4 si during each kinetic run the concentrations of 2 acetonaphthone and 4 cyanophenol remained almost constant 5 with 0 1 μm initial concentration and 15 with 5 0 μm initial concentration fig s5 si moreover no correction for direct photolysis was necessary for these k obs data due to the minor transformation rates measured in the absence of 2 an table s4a si consistently for both tcs k 0 1 obs was observed to increase linearly with 4 cyanophenol concentration while k 5 0 obs was not affected significantly by the presence of 4 cyanophenol furthermore several irradiation experiments were conducted at various initial tc concentrations between 0 1 and 5 0 μm the corresponding k obs plotted as a function of the initial tc concentration fig 5c d exhibit a hyperbolic decrease as already observed for dmop remke et al 2021 despite the mentioned similarities there are several differences in the k obs trends for tmp and aniline a first difference concerns the slope of the line k obs as a function of 4 cn phoh fig 5a b which is about 10 times smaller for aniline than for tmp this difference in the slope could be due to either a slower electron transfer reaction between 4 cn pho and aniline compared to tmp or a less efficient transformation of the formed aniline radical cation to an oxidation product compared to the tmp phenoxyl radical aniline radicals or radical cations are known to undergo back reduction in the presence of antioxidants to form the original compound which results in a decrease in their transformation rates wenk and canonica 2012 leresche et al 2020 in the present experiments the superoxide radical anion o2 which according to scheme 1 is formed during the irradiation of a photosensitizer such as 2 an in the presence of an electron donor such as the 4 cyanophenoxide ion tmp and aniline in the present experiments could play the antioxidant role by reducing the aniline radical thereby contributing to a lower transformation rate of aniline a second important difference is that for aniline and 4 methylaniline fig s7 si k 5 0 obs k 0 1 obs for 4 cyanophenol concentrations below 2 μm whereas for tmp k 5 0 obs k 0 1 obs for any 4 cyanophenol concentration in particular in the absence of 4 cyanophenol k 5 0 obs 7 k 0 1 obs this is not explainable based on the kinetic model of fig 1 which would predict a pseudo first order rate constant independent of initial tc concentration see discussion below this anomaly in the photosensitized transformation of aniline might be due to aniline radical phnh coupling reactions of the type described in eq 5 which would compete with the back reduction process leading to a faster aniline transformation higher k obs with increasing phnh and therefore with increasing aniline concentration 5 phnh phnh phn 2 the occurrence of such coupling reactions leading to the formation of azobenzenes was found for the transformation of anilines photosensitized by different humic substances zepp et al 1981 and for the oxidation of anilines by manganese dioxide laha and luthy 1990 the aforementioned hyperbolic decrease in k obs with increasing initial concentration of tmp and aniline in irradiated solutions containing 2 an and 4 cyanophenol 5 μm fig 5c d was modeled using a previously developed relationship eq 6 remke et al 2021 6 k tc obs k 3 2 an tc obs β 4 cn pho tc r tc 0 where k tc obs is the pseudo first order rate constant for tc abatement k 3 2 an tc obs is the direct contribution of the reaction of tc with the excited triplet state of 2 an to k tc obs and β 4 cn pho tc r tc 0 is the contribution of the reaction of tc with the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical to k tc obs the parameter β 4 cn pho tc r being an inverse proportionality factor non linear fits of k tc obs vs tc 0 according to eq 6 are summarized in table 1 the second term of the k tc obs calculation in eq 6 can also be expressed as 7 β 4 cn pho tc r tc 0 k 4 cn pho tc r 4 cn pho ss where k 4 cn pho tc r is the second order rate constant for the reaction of tc with 4 cn pho leading to the transformation of tc and 4 cn pho ss is the steady state concentration of 4 cn pho in turn 4 cn pho ss can be expressed as the ratio of the rate of its formation r 4 cn pho f and the first order rate constant for its decay we assume that for tmp and dmop experiments these compounds are the only scavengers of 4 cn pho present in solution and that their reaction with tc leads to the transformation of tc with a yield of one in this case the following equation holds 8 4 cn pho ss r 4 cn pho f k 4 cn pho tc r tc 0 substituting eq 8 into eq 7 and multiplying both sides by tc 0 yields eq 9 9 β 4 cn pho tc r r 4 cn pho f these calculations provided the above assumptions regarding the transformation of tc and the scavenging of 4 cn pho are valid are able to explain why β 4 cn pho tc r does not depend on tc β 4 cn pho dmop r β 4 cn pho tmp r and corresponds to the rate of formation of 4 cn pho for the case of tmp and dmop when comparing the diagrams of tmp and aniline fig 5c d it is evident that k obs for aniline cover a much narrower range than for tmp this is reflected in β 4 cn pho aniline r which is more than one order of magnitude lower than β 4 cn pho dmop r and β 4 cn pho tmp r this is a direct consequence of the observations displayed in fig 5b and thoroughly discussed above despite a good data fit to eq 6 aniline cannot be used to estimate r 4 cn ph o f because its transformation is most probably inhibited by the superoxide radical anion as discussed in a recent study wenk et al 2021 in addition aniline transformation is accelerated at higher concentrations as explained before therefore eq 9 is not valid in the case of aniline 3 3 quenching of the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical by target compounds laser flash photolysis experiments were performed primarily to determine second order rate constants for the quenching of electron poor phenoxyl radicals by phenols and anilines the reaction scheme applicable to these experiments is the same as for the photosensitized transformation of a tc in the presence of an electron poor phenol fig 1b upper part because of the intrinsic difficulty of the experiments which are impaired by spectral overlap of the various transient species in particular r phoep and tc experimental series were restricted to the study of the 4 cyanophenoxyl radical the latter is the main radical investigated in this and a previous study remke et al 2021 and it exhibits a characteristic absorption band with a narrow maximum at 436 nm bronner and wenger 2012 d alessandro et al 2000 the primary selected tc was tmp because of the minor interference caused by absorption of its phenoxyl radical transient absorption spectra obtained by laser flash photolysis of an aerated aqueous solution ph 8 0 containing 2 an 150 μm 4 cyanophenol 2 mm in the absence or presence of tmp 250 μm are shown in fig 6 a or b respectively fig s9 si represents the simulated regime of transients in this mixture at a very short delay time 50 ns after the laser pulse the transient spectra mainly represent the absorption of 32 an maximum at 440 nm with a small peak at 436 nm corresponding to 4 cn pho with increasing delay time the absorption of 4 cn pho becomes clearer and persists in the absence of tmp fig 6a while the absorption of 32 an strongly decreases and finally disappears the band at about 390 nm see 2 μs delay spectrum is attributed to the ketyl radical or radical anion of 2 an resulting through the electron transfer from 4 cn pho to 32 an and disappears at long delay times mainly due to reaction with oxygen to yield superoxide radical ion bryce and wells 1963 in the presence of tmp fig 6b the 4 cn pho peak at 436 nm grows until intermediate delay times then decreases and finally disappears after 50 μs while a new peak appears at 395 nm after 10 μs which persists at least up to 50 μs this peak is attributed to the phenoxyl radical of tmp which is formed by the reaction of 4 cn pho with tmp the just described temporal sequence of species is analogous to the one observed in a previous study about the radical cation of 4 dimethylamino benzonitrile and its reaction with phenols and various types of dom leresche et al 2020 a kinetic model of the main transients formed in the presence of tmp supports this assignment text s5 and fig s9 si data obtained using lfp 1 time delays after the laser pulse are indicated in the diagrams the excitation wavelength was 355 nm for all of the spectra samples were buffered at ph 8 with phosphate buffer 20 mm the rate of 4 cn pho decay was observed to increase with increasing concentration of the added tmp see the corresponding absorption traces measured at 436 nm figs s14 and s15 si fitting the decay traces to a single exponential function with a constant offset yielded first order rate constants that increased with increasing tmp concentration fig 7 b first we consider the value of the first order decay rate constant of 4 cn pho in the absence of tmp i e for tmp 0 which is close to 2 5 104 s 1 this value corresponds to a lifetime of 40 μs for 4 cn pho under the present laser flash photolysis experimental conditions the lifetime of 4 cn pho under the conditions used for steady state irradiation is probably significantly higher than this since the concentration of reactive radical species that could contribute to its quenching such as 4 cn pho itself sens and o2 is much lower consequently 4 cn pho is a long lived species compared to the excited triplet state of any photosensitizer in aerated aqueous solution and is appropriate from this point of view as an llpo surrogate second linear regression lines of the aforementioned first order rate constants fig 7b were used to determine the second order rate constant for the quenching of 4 cn pho by tmp k 4 cn pho tmp q values of k 4 cn pho tmp q of 2 6 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 and 5 3 0 1 108 m 1 s 1 for measurements performed using the instruments lfp 1 and lfp 2 respectively were obtained an experimental series performed using deuterated water as a solvent and lfp 1 yielded k 4 cn pho tmp q 1 68 0 09 108 m 1 s 1 from which a deuterium isotope effect of 1 5 0 3 was derived this suggests that a proton either from the solvent or from the phenolic functional group of tmp is involved in the rate determining step of the reaction between 4 cn pho and tmp open and filled symbols represent two distinct measurement series performed using the same equipment orange squares and rate constants data obtained using lfp 1 dark brown triangles and rate constants data obtained using lfp 2 excitation wavelength was 355 nm for all of the measurements samples were buffered at ph 8 with phosphate buffer 20 mm the reason why two significantly different k 4 cn pho tmp q values using different instruments were obtained could be due to the different signal intensities which were higher for lfp 2 than for lfp 1 taking the higher value of 5 3 0 1 108 m 1 s 1 as a limit for a higher estimate one can definitely state that it is much lower than typical diffusion controlled rate constants for the reaction of phenoxyl radicals with electron donors i e 4 109 m 1 s 1 neta and grodkowski 2005 this conclusion matches with the prediction made in section 3 1 about the magnitude of k 4 cn pho tmp q unfortunately for dmop the determination of the corresponding rate constant was not possible because of the superposition of the uv vis absorption bands of the dmop phenoxl radical and 4 cn pho in view of the conclusions of section 3 1 and the lower value of e red 1 0 for dmop compared to tmp it is very likely that k 4 cn ph o dmop q k 4 cn p ho tm p q analogous laser flash photolysis experiments were performed using aniline and 4 methylaniline as target compounds in solution containing 2 an as a photosensitizer and 4 cn phoh as an electron poor phenol the formation of the corresponding aniline radicals or radical cations could be observed fig s8 c f si however the determination of second order rate constant for the reaction of 4 cn pho with these anilines was not successful due to strong spectral overlap caused by these radicals additional experiments were performed to determine second order rate constants for the quenching of 32 an by the 4 cyanophenol fig 7a aniline and 4 methylaniline 4 ma table 2 the transient absorption decay traces of 32 an measured at 440 450 nm were fitted to single exponential functions to obtain the corresponding first order quenching rate constants figs s11 13 si the latter were then plotted against quencher concentration to determine second order rate constants as the slope of the corresponding linear regression lines the rate constants for the quenching of triplet state 2 acetonaphtone are summarized in table 2 fig s10 si the values determined for 4 cyanophenol with the two different laser flash photolysis instruments are identical within experimental error and lead to an average value of k 3 2 a n 4 cn phoh q 3 3 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 measured at ph 8 0 fig 7a assuming that quenching is due exclusively to the 4 cyanophenoxide ion and considering the speciation of 4 cyanophenol the quenching rate constant for the 4 cyanophenoxide ion can be estimated as k 3 2 an 4 cn ph o q 6 6 0 6 108 m 1 s 1 this value is about half of the value that can be extrapolated from a previous less precise rate constant determined at ph 6 0 canonica et al 2000 for the anilines second order quenching rate constants are not far from the diffusion controlled limit but about 30 lower compared to corresponding values previously measured for dmop and trolox canonica et al 2000 and within the range of values determined for the quenching of the excited triplet state of methylene blue by various anilines at ph 8 4 erickson et al 2015 4 environmental implications the motivation of this study was to characterize the still elusive dom derived long lived photooxidants llpo and to test the hypothesis that they may consist of electron poor phenoxyl radicals the applied model systems to mimic llpo were solutions containing a model photosensitizer and an electron poor phenol irradiation experiments were performed under the same conditions as many previous experiments using cdom as a source of photooxidants thereby electron poor phenoxyl radicals were produced which were observed to induce the transformation of typical target compounds subject to llpo effect all investigated electron poor phenoxyl radicals having reduction potentials in the range of 0 85 1 12 v vs she lead to a significant enhancement in the photosensitized transformation of the llpo probe compounds dmop and tmp this fact suggests that the lower limit of e red 1 0 of dom derived llpo might be lower than the previously estimated value of 1 0 v remke et al 2021 moreover the determined second order rate constant for the reaction of tmp with 4 cn pho 4 1 108 m 1 s 1 was well below the diffusion controlled limit for the other studied phenoxyl radicals having lower e red 1 0 values compared to the 4 cn pho lower rate constants for their reaction with tmp are expected therefore having second order rate constants near the diffusion controlled limit does not appear to be required for an enhancement of the phototransformation of llpo probe compounds under steady state irradiation due to the presence of phenoxyl radicals in conclusion the estimation of e red 1 0 of llpo based on the oxidation potentials of probe compounds remke et al 2021 and on e red 1 0 values of model oxidants in the present study electron poor phenoxyl radicals is not straightforward and needs further investigation the formation pathways of llpo during irradiation of cdom are still unknown one possible pathway which was modelled in the present study assumes llpo to be formed by reaction of 3sens as a surrogate for 3cdom with electron poor phenols using 3cbbp and 32 an as 3cdom surrogates with high and low e red 1 0 respectively two different behaviors in the effect of electron poor phenoxyl radicals on phenolic tcs transformation were observed 1 with 3cbbp an increase in phototransformation that was related to an increase in e red 1 0 of the electron poor phenoxyl radicals with an assumed uniform production rate of all these radicals and 2 with 32 an an increase in phototransformation that was mainly related to an increase of the degree of deprotonation of the electron poor phenols since e red 1 0 of 3cdom spans a wide range covering the values for 3cbbp and 32 an both of the above behaviors are expected to occur concomitantly in irradiated cdom solution the contribution of a 32 an like behavior agrees with the observed increase of the llpo effect with increasing ph canonica and freiburghaus 2001 such a ph effect would also be compatible with direct photoionization of phenoxides as electron poor phenoxyl radical source see eq 4 since phenoxides have increased light absorption fig s3 si and photoionization quantum yields compared to the corresponding undissociated phenols grabner et al 1977 both effects lead to increased rates of phenoxyl radical production from phenoxides compared to phenols transformation rates of aniline and 4 methylaniline due to reaction with 4 cn pho were observed to be much lower than the corresponding rates for tmp and dmop this would suggest a reduced importance of llpo in the phototransformation of anilines compared to electron rich phenols also for model systems with 32 an and 4 cn pho as model photooxidants the enhancement of aniline transformation by reducing the initial concentration of aniline from 5 0 to 0 1 μm was much smaller than for the phenolic tcs this effect attributed to a complex behavior in the photosensitized transformation of the anilines which appears to be influenced by autocatalysis in the studied initial concentration range is able to explain the low enhancement factors observed using suwannee river fulvic acid as source of 3cdom and llpo remke et al 2021 moreover these observations suggest that indirect phototransformation kinetics of anilines should be measured at very low concentrations 0 1 μm to make accurate predictions on the fate of anilines in sunlit surface waters 5 conclusions in this study target compound transformation mediated by various photochemically produced electron poor phenoxyl radicals was investigated the transformation of the electron rich compounds 3 4 dimethoxyphenol and 2 4 6 trimethylphenol aniline and 4 methylaniline was monitored in aqueous solutions of dom model systems each consisting of an aromatic ketone as photosensitizer and an electron poor phenol as llpo precursor for a low initial concentration 0 1 μm of the target compounds higher transformation rate constants were observed compared to a higher initial concentration 5 0 μm confirming the involvement of long lived reactive species assumed to be photochemically produced electron poor phenoxyl radicals with increasing e red 1 0 of the employed phenoxyl radicals faster transformations of phenolic target compounds were observed while the selectivity of the phenoxyl radicals decreased the formation rate of phenoxyl radicals from electron poor phenols was shown to be controlled by both the one electron reduction potential of the excited triplet state of the photosensitizer and the fraction of the electron poor phenoxide the rates of aniline and 4 methylaniline transformation induced by photochemically produced 4 cyanophenoxyl radical were significantly lower than for the transformation of phenolic target compounds this is interpreted as an indication that transformation of anilines is probably hampered by back reduction of their radical oxidation intermediates through reductants primarily the superoxide radical ion the second order rate constant for the quenching of 4 cyanophenoxyl radical by 2 4 6 trimethylphenol in aqueous solution was determined as 4 1 108 m 1s 1 the moderate but significant deuterium isotope effect for this rate constant 1 5 indicates a proton coupled electron transfer in the rate determining step of the reaction the results of this study are crucial to understand the nature of llpo generated by irradiation of cdom solutions for instance they enabled an estimation of reduction potentials of llpo and provided possible explanations for the previously observed ph dependence of the llpo effect and low enhancement factors for anilines in irradiated cdom solutions funding this study was supported by the swiss national

16239,removing dissolved selenium i e selenate and selenite from wastewater is a challenging issue for a range of industries iron electrocoagulation can produce fe ii containing solids that can adsorb and chemically reduce dissolved se in a series of bench scale experiments we investigated the effects of dissolved oxygen fully oxic partially oxic and strictly anoxic and ph 6 and 8 on the rate and extent of dissolved selenate and selenite removal by iron electrocoagulation these studies combined measurements of the aqueous phase with the direct characterization of the resulting solids among the conditions studied the rate and extent of dissolved selenium se removal were highest at ph 8 and strictly anoxic conditions x ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that in the absence of oxygen se was primarily transformed to elemental selenium se0 and selenide green rust that formed in the suspension during electrocoagulation played a key role as a reductant and sorbent of se at ph 6 dissolved oxygen did not affect the rates and extents of dissolved se removal under all the conditions studied dissolved se removal was more effective with iron electrocoagulation than with the direct addition of pre synthesized green rust or ferrous hydroxide the most rapid and substantial dissolved se removal was achieved by freshly formed green rust and ferrous hydroxide which are both fe ii bearing solids with an improved understanding of the products and mechanisms of the process iron electrocoagulation can be optimized for removal of se from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved selenium iron electrocoagulation ph dissolved oxygen green rust 1 introduction selenium se accumulation in aquatic environments can negatively impact humans and aquatic organisms while se is a required nutrient at low doses excess human exposure to se can cause abnormal fetal developments cranial facial deformities and nervous system and skin diseases lemly 1993 lindberg et al 2011 ohlendorf et al 1986 who 1996 the maximum contaminant level for se in u s drinking water is 50 μg l u s epa 2016 the sources of se to aquatic environments include runoff from agriculture wang et al 1995 weathering from mining sites scheinost and charlet 2008 and the discharge of wastewater from diverse industries moore and mahmoudkhani 2011 se species are found in waters associated with the processing and use of coal moore and mahmoudkhani 2011 flue gas desulfurization operations that control so2 emissions from coal fired power plants remove se and sulfur species from exhaust gases simultaneously which results in wastewaters that can be particularly rich in selenite buecker 2011 waters generated in the mining agricultural and power sectors contain selenium over a broad range of concentrations from about 10 µg l in landfill leachates to more than 1000 µg l in flue gas desulfurization wastewaters golder associates ltd 2020 current effluent limits are as low as 5 20 µg l se species have different mobility and toxicity depending on their oxidation states which include vi selenate iv selenite 0 elemental selenium and ii selenide masscheleyn et al 1990 selenate and selenite are more soluble and mobile than the less oxidized species mayland et al 1991 selenate in particular is more mobile than other se species and is resistant to removal by adsorption oremland et al 1990 sheoran and sheoran 2006 previous research has examined dissolved se adsorption to iron oxides lounsbury et al 2019 peak and sparks 2002 aluminium oxides yamani et al 2014 and cement minerals baur and johnson 2003 however adsorption alone has shown little success in selenate removal sheoran and sheoran 2006 treatment can be accomplished by microbial reduction of dissolved se vi and se iv to se0 oremland et al 1990 rittmann 2018 commercially available selenium removal systems are largely biologically based these approaches face challenges of stable performance with variable influent composition and intermittent operations temperature dependent performance especially for cold regions and the generation of bioavailable organoselenium species gingerich et al 2018 golder associates ltd 2020 chemical reduction can transform dissolved se into less soluble reduced forms myneni et al 1997 effective reductants include zero valent iron shrimpton et al 2015 fe ii containing solids such as green rust fe ii xfe iii oh 2x 2 myneni et al 1997 schellenger and larese casanova 2013 and ferrous hydroxide fe oh 2 s murphy 1988 and pyrite breynaert et al 2010 zero valent iron has been deployed as a commercially available technology but it lacks precision for selenate removal as its reduction capacity is consumed by nitrate and even water itself some emerging technologies are focusing on electrochemical reduction zou and mauter 2021 reduction of dissolved se can also be achieved using sulfur based reductants e g dithionite sulfide and some of these reactions are accelerated by photochemical processes jung et al 2016 jung et al 2018 electrocoagulation is a commercially available technology that has been examined for the removal of metals and metalloids from water holt et al 2005 iron electrocoagulation can potentially treat the dissolved se in wastewaters by producing iron containing suspended solids that are effective reductants or adsorbents symonds et al 2015 recent research found that fe ii released during iron electrocoagulation chemically reduced cr vi to less soluble cr iii species that eventually precipitate with iron oxides adhoum et al 2004 pan et al 2016 iron electrocoagulation produces high surface area iron oxides that are also effective adsorbents for the removal of dissolved arsenic species bandaru et al 2020 catrouillet et al 2020 van genuchten et al 2012 wan et al 2011 wang and giammar 2015 the generation of fe ii and its subsequent oxidation to fe iii during iron electrocoagulation could facilitate the removal of se vi from solution specifically fe ii bearing solids could be generated that are effective chemical reductants of se vi and se iv that then retain the reduced forms of se by adsorption incorporation or precipitation some previous studies observed that electrode spacing anode cathode position and contact time can affect dissolved selenate removal using iron electrocoagulation baek et al 2013a 2013b these studies found that the selenate removal rates were significantly affected by the initial selenate concentration electric current and presence of other anions nevertheless there had been no prior systematic investigation of the effect of oxygen level and ph on se removal by iron electrocoagulation in this study oxygen level and ph were prioritized for investigation because of their strong influence on the concentrations and speciation of dissolved and solid phase iron species produced and the impact of iron speciation on selenium removal because reduction of se vi is likely a critical initial step in se vi removal in iron electrocoagulation it is important to explore the competition between se vi and dissolved oxygen for reaction with the fe ii generated in iron electrocoagulation the rates of fe ii oxidation by dissolved oxygen are strongly ph and oxygen level dependent in our previous study of cr vi removal with iron electrocoagulation ph and dissolved oxygen level controlled overall cr vi removal through their influence on the relative rates of cr vi and dissolved oxygen reaction with fe ii pan et al 2016 furthermore previous studies baek et al 2013a 2013b had not identified the specific selenium containing products formed by iron electrocoagulation during selenate removal the goal of this study was to determine the impacts of dissolved oxygen and ph on the rate extent and products of dissolved se removal during iron electrocoagulation a specific focus was placed on how ph and dissolved oxygen levels influenced the iron containing solids that were produced and the role of those solids in the removal of dissolved se the differences between dissolved se removal during iron electrocoagulation and the direct addition of fe ii containing solutions and solids were also examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in experiments and analyses were reagents of high purity specific information about these chemicals is presented in section s1 of the supplementary materials the ph buffer 2 n morpholino ethanesulfonic acid mes was selected because it does not affect the adsorption of metals onto iron oxides ferreira et al 2015 soares et al 2000 we note that a recent study observed the production of different iron oxyhydroxides from zero valent iron depending on the conditions of sulfonic acid buffers including mes he et al 2018 all solutions for stocks were prepared with ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm 2 2 iron electrocoagulation batch experiments the batch solution was composed of 0 0140 mm seo4 2 1 10 mg l as se 10 mm nacl and 2 mm mes for all ph and dissolved oxygen conditions the electrocoagulation reactor contained two iron rods serving as both anode and cathode in a 500 ml borosilicate glass beaker with the batch solution fig 1 a each rod had an initial immersed surface area of 23 6 cm2 diameter 1 7 cm immersed length 4 0 cm the rods were placed 5 cm apart in the solution prior to each experiment the electrode surfaces were cleaned with sandpaper a voltage of 8 v was applied to the electrodes from a direct current dc power supply for 120 min for each batch experiment this voltage was within the range used in previous studies and the 120 min duration provided a good temporal resolution of the changes in selenium concentrations since the initial current of 60 ma 2 54 ma cm2 tended to drift up during the reaction the value was maintained by decreasing the contact area of the immersed iron rods during each experiment for those experiments in which the current density changed in order to allow operation at constant voltage and current the overpotentials on the electrodes were also changing since the solution resistance remained essentially constant during the reaction the solution was mixed by a magnetic stirrer and stir bar at regular intervals during electrocoagulation 11 ml volumes of suspension were collected of these volumes 6 ml was filtered using a 0 2 μm polyethersulfone filter membrane tisch scientific and 5 ml was kept as an unfiltered sample all the samples were acidified by adding concentrated nitric acid to provide 1 of hno3 by mass in the samples prior to analysis at the end of each batch experiment the suspended solids present in the reactor were collected for solid phase characterization during iron electrocoagulation dissolved se transformed into several different forms including suspended solid phases that were classified as either acid soluble or non acid soluble fig 1b the total se that was present as dissolved species and in acid soluble suspended solids was measured by acidifying an unfiltered sample additional details are in section s2 the differences in se concentrations between the unfiltered and filtered samples give the concentration of acid soluble suspended se fig 1b the fractions of the initially added se that were not recovered upon acidification of the unfiltered samples were either se species not soluble in nitric acid or se species no longer contained in the suspension electrocoagulation experiments were conducted at three different oxygen levels strictly anoxic partially oxic and fully oxic conditions and two different ph values ph 6 and 8 the ph conditions selected are relevant to water treatment the range of ph of flue gas desulfurization wastewater is between 4 5 and 9 higgins et al 2009 the two ph values considered in our study ph 6 and 8 have vastly different rates of fe ii oxidation in the presence of dissolved oxygen the experiments with the strictly anoxic condition were performed in an oxygen free anaerobic chamber 97 n2 and 3 h2 the dissolved oxygen concentration was monitored for the anoxic condition setup and was always found to be below the detection limit 0 08 mg l of our optical do probe ecosense odo200 ysi which corresponds to po2 less than 0 0019 atm and an eh for the o2 h2o couple less than 0 83 v at ph 6 partially oxic and fully oxic experiments were performed outside of the anaerobic chamber under partially oxic conditions the solution was sparged with a mixture of pure nitrogen 290 ml min and air 10 ml min that maintained do at 0 32 0 22 mg l po2 of 0 0077 0 0053 atm and eh of the o2 h2o couple of 0 84 v at ph 6 under fully oxic conditions po2 of 0 21 atm and eh of the o2 h2o couple of 0 86 v at ph 6 the solution was sparged with air at a flow rate of 300 ml min to continuously resupply do consumed during the process the solutions sparged with air would have more dissolved inorganic carbon than those performed in the glove box or with nitrogen sparging suggesting that the strictly anoxic condition had little dissolved inorganic carbon the ph of the solution was repeatedly measured and readjusted back to within 0 4 units of the target ph during the experiment by adding hcl or naoh because of the greater buffering capacity of mes pka 6 15 at ph 6 the ph varied less at ph 6 than it did at ph 8 the current was briefly turned off less than one minute during the times when the ph was measured because the current interfered with the ph measurement duplicate runs were performed for each set of experimental conditions after the reaction we collected deposits on the anode and cathode by scraping them off with sandpaper these solids were oxidized in a solution of 0 0403 m naocl for 24 h to convert adsorbed se compounds into soluble forms and the resulting solution was analyzed to measure the total selenium mass deposited on each electrode the overpotentials of the anode and cathode at ph 6 and fully oxic conditions were measured for conditions of constant current 60 ma in experiments with 120 min durations measurements used a potentiostat gamry reference 600 and a ag agcl kcl reference electrode section s3 the distance between the reference electrode and working electrode during measurements was approximately 0 2 cm which would result in negligible solution resistance between the reference and working electrodes 2 3 control experiments with chemical addition of fe ii containing species control experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of dissolved and solid phase iron species on dissolved se removal in the absence of electric current in these experiments either dissolved fe ii or pre synthesized fe ii containing solids were directly added to the glass beaker instead of producing them in situ by electrocoagulation total iron concentrations used in the control experiments were selected to be comparable to the amounts generated in the 120 min iron electrocoagulation experiments control experiments with dissolved fe ii were performed under strictly anoxic conditions at ph 6 control experiments using pre synthesized green rust or fe oh 2 s were performed under strictly anoxic conditions at ph 8 in these experiments green rust or fe oh 2 s was first precipitated and then a selenate solution was added to the suspension section s4 describes the methods for synthesizing and identifying green rust and fe oh 2 s 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of fe and se were determined by icp ms elan drc ii perkinelmer the instrument detection limits for se and fe were 0 1 μg l and 10 μg l respectively in addition to measurements of total and dissolved iron concentration the dissolved fe ii concentration was also measured using the ferrozine method on samples immediately after their collection viollier et al 2000 x ray absorption spectroscopy xas was used to determine the oxidation state of se in the collected solid phase products selenium k edge x ray absorption spectra were obtained at beamlines 5 bm d and 20 bm b at the advanced photon source the main peak in the first derivative of the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectrum of se0 was set to 12 660 2 ev to obtain relative quantities of se in different oxidation states background subtraction averaging normalization and linear combination fitting lcf were done through the athena interface ravel and newville 2005 more detailed information on xas sample preparation and interpretation including the selection of reference materials necessary for lcf is provided in section s5 x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation was used to identify crystalline solid phases produced in the iron electrocoagulation and control experiments additional information on the procedures for x ray absorption spectroscopy and xrd analyses is provided in section s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 iron containing solids produced from iron electrocoagulation more than 250 mg l of total iron was generated over the 120 min experiment fig 2 released as dissolved fe ii from the anode the dissolved fe ii could then transform into fe ii or fe iii containing solids based on the oxygen level and ph at the cathode the most likely reaction was a reduction of h to yield hydrogen sawyer et al 2003 total released iron concentrations were compared with predictions based on faraday s law 1 m fe m w fe i t z f where m fe is the amount of iron released from the iron anode mg mw fe is the molecular weight of iron 55 845 mg mol i is the current amperes which is the same as c s t is time s z is the number of electrons transferred per iron atom released from the iron rod here z is 2 and f is faraday s constant 96 485 c mol calculated total fe concentrations were obtained by dividing m fe by the batch volume 500 ml there was good agreement between the total iron concentrations and the predictions from faraday s law in experiments with stable currents the current remained stable in the fully oxic and partially oxic experiments fig s4 having both stable current and voltage indicates that the electrode overpotentials were unaffected by changes in surface structures e g passivation or depassivation over the duration of the experiments ingelsson et al 2020 in separate measurements made in a constant current mode at ph 6 and fully oxic conditions the anode electrode overpotential was measured as approximately 1 55 v and the cathode overpotential was approximately 3 89 v fig s2 in the experiments performed at strictly anoxic conditions the current was stable at 60 ma 2 54 2 66 ma cm2 for the first 60 min but it then fluctuated between 60 90 ma 2 54 4 29 ma cm2 at ph 6 and 70 90 ma 3 34 4 29 ma cm2 at ph 8 for the last 60 min fig s4 such increases in current and current density mean that the solution resistance is increasing for this to occur while maintaining a constant applied potential indicates that the electrode overpotentials are decreasing over time a decrease in the electrode overpotentials could be associated with the depassivation of the anode surface that may occur as a microscopic iron oxide layer is released to solution as the anode corrodes and that cannot be regenerated at strictly anoxic conditions further investigation in future studies may yield insights into what processes occurred in strictly anoxic condition that induced current variation the range of the current density was given because the contact area of the immersed iron rods was decreasing during the electrocoagulation the change of the current density could affect any se removal that is associated with direct reaction on the electrodes the formation of particular phases of iron containing solids was controlled by the ph oxygen levels and presence of selenate at ph 8 under strictly anoxic conditions equilibrium calculations indicate that fe oh 2 s formation is thermodynamically favorable fig s3 for the iron ii concentrations generated approximately 30 of released fe from the iron rod was transformed into a fe ii containing solid fig 2 depending on the water treatment objectives the remaining dissolved fe may need to be removed in subsequent steps of an overall treatment train post electrocoagulation processes are discussed in section 3 8 at ph 8 under strictly anoxic conditions without selenate a white precipitate formed during electrocoagulation fig s5a xrd patterns indicate that this white precipitate was fe oh 2 s with possible trace amounts of feroxyhyte δ feo oh fig s6 when selenate was present at this same condition of ph 8 and strictly anoxic conditions a blue green suspension indicative of green rust formed xrd patterns fig 3 a confirmed that the blue greenish suspension obtained after the electrocoagulation reaction contained green rust together with fe oh 2 s the xrd patterns for these samples were relatively weak which was probably due to the small amount of sample available for analysis 100 130 mg as fe as well as the poorly crystalline nature of the solids the broad scattering profile between 20 and 40 probably indicates moisture contained in the slurry lad et al 2013 or amorphous materials the formation of feroxyhyte in this condition likely occurred due to oxidation during the xrd analyses jurkin et al 2016 since green rust is highly unstable in the atmosphere we prepared samples in a manner that protected them from contact with air and we analyzed them within 1 h of sample preparation specific procedures are described in section s5 in supplementary materials green rust is a phase often observed during iron electrocoagulation at low dissolved oxygen conditions dubrawski et al 2015 although a recent study found that green rust may form from fe oh 2 without an oxidant other than water tosca et al 2018 several other studies determined that se vi can promote the initiation of green rust formation from fe oh 2 s at anoxic conditions by oxidation of a portion of fe ii to fe iii refait et al 1997 refait et al 2000 based on the xrd pattern the initial green rust was chloride green rust which is also the solid that was synthesized from chemical reagents at similar conditions for use in this study fig s6 while selenate green rust has formed in other studies its xrd pattern is distinct from that of chloride green rust refait et al 2000 based on the pe ph diagram fig 4 green rust is the predicted phase at the most highly reducing conditions after reaction with se vi there is the potential for selenate green rust formation which has been observed in previous research on green rust reactions with se vi at conditions similar to those in this study myneni et al 1997 the dynamics of selenium and iron uptake by the solid phases at ph 8 and anoxic conditions are also consistent with the formation of green rust this can be illustrated by examining the concentrations of dissolved and total selenium after 40 min of reaction which is near the end of the period of the most rapid removal of selenium from the solution at this point 1000 µg l of se 0 0127 mm had been lost from solution fig 5 and the solids are likely to contain approximately 20 mg l of fe 0 36 mm difference between total fe ii produced and measured dissolved fe in fig 2 xanes results fig 6 indicate that se ii was the dominant form of se in the solids generated during this reaction considering se ii as the dominant form we can determine that 0 10 mm of fe ii would have been oxidized to fe iii upon reaction with 0 0127 mm se vi i e 8 electrons per mole of se vi reduced this oxidation could result in a solid with a fe ii fe iii ratio of 2 6 1 which is in the range observed for green rust refait et al 2000 however fe oh 2 s might become dominant at the end of the reaction because solid phase fe ii was several times higher than what is needed for the complete reduction of the se vi species in the reactor specific calculations describing the solid phase fe ii amount necessary for complete se vi reduction are shown in section s7 under partially oxic or fully oxic conditions at ph 8 more than 99 of the dissolved iron transformed into solid phases resulting in dissolved iron concentrations below 5 mg l throughout the reaction fig 2a as expected for iron in the presence of dissolved oxygen fig 4 the dissolved fe ii released from the anode was oxidized by dissolved oxygen to fe iii that precipitate as oxyhydroxide solids xrd patterns of green rust fe oh 2 s ferrihydrite and feroxyhyte were detected in solids generated during electrocoagulation at partially oxic conditions at ph 8 fig 3b here the intensities of feroxyhyte peaks were higher than those at strictly anoxic ph 8 condition the formation of feroxyhyte was probably influenced by the reaction of iron oxides or dissolved fe ii with trace oxygen in the batch during the electrocoagulation olowe et al 1994 as well as by oxidation during the solid sample preparation and xrd analyses jurkin et al 2016 more discussion of the xrd patterns of partially oxic and fully oxic conditions is provided in section s8 under strictly anoxic conditions approximately 99 9 of the released fe persisted in the dissolved phase at ph 6 under partially oxic and fully oxic conditions 23 7 and 97 4 of released fe transformed into the solid phase respectively fig 2b ferrozine analyses of samples from experiments at strictly anoxic conditions revealed that essentially all 99 9 of the dissolved iron was fe ii in experiments at both ph 6 and 8 3 2 effects of oxygen level on dissolved se removal at ph 8 the rate and extent of dissolved se removal were highest under strictly anoxic conditions at ph 8 fig 5a under these conditions it took less than 60 min for the dissolved se concentration to fall below the detection limit of 0 1 µg l the extent of dissolved se removal decreased when the do concentration increased even slightly fig 5a at a partially oxic condition with do less than 0 08 mg l the dissolved se concentration dropped from 1100 to 212 μg l 80 7 mol mol removed after 120 min in both the fully oxic condition do 8 0 8 7 mg l and partially oxic condition with do of 0 3 mg l the dissolved se concentrations were still 600 μg l 45 5 mol mol removed after 120 min the limited removal of dissolved se at these do levels and ph 8 is probably due to the consumption of fe ii by oxidation with do that dramatically decreases the available fe ii for reaction with se vi regardless of the do at ph 8 the se concentrations in acid soluble samples decreased linearly versus time fig 5b the average unfiltered se concentration after 120 min for the three do levels was 497 28 4 μg l which indicates that about 54 of the initial dissolved se was converted into a form that was not acid soluble the acid dissolution tests fig s7 confirmed that se0 exists in the solid phase under all experimental conditions and does not dissolve in acid digestion equilibrium calculations fig 4 also showed that se0 dissolution is not favorable under acidic conditions this trend indicates that se0 or other forms that could not be dissolved upon acid addition e g attached on the wall or volatilized formed during electrocoagulation se that could not be accounted for upon acid addition in collected samples of suspension had probably become associated with the iron anode and cathode and was simply not present in the suspension at ph 8 the sum of se deposition on the anode and cathode was 13 8 41 7 µg depending on the oxygen level se deposition on the iron electrodes is discussed further in section 3 6 solid phase products collected after electrocoagulation treatments were further characterized by xanes analyses fig 6 lcf was carried out to determine the relative amounts of se in different oxidation states table 1 at strictly anoxic conditions se in the solid products was predominantly present as a selenide phase 91 this is consistent with fese s being the thermodynamically most stable form of se at ph 8 and at reducing conditions fig 4 and with observations from previous studies of se iv reaction with other fe ii containing solids scheinost and charlet 2008 at partially oxic conditions most se was still selenate 67 with smaller portions as selenite 22 or selenide 11 se vi in the solid products of iron electrocoagulation at partially oxic conditions was probably adsorbed to fe iii containing solids 3 3 effects of oxygen level on se removal at ph 6 at ph 6 the dissolved se removal rate and extent during electrocoagulation were practically independent of do fig 5c the remaining dissolved se concentrations after 120 min ranged from 36 to 236 μg l as se a much narrower range than that observed for ph 8 for fully oxic partially oxic and strictly anoxic conditions the dissolved se concentration decreased almost linearly over 20 60 min at 12 7 10 6 and 11 6 μg l min respectively although different do levels produced different phases of iron oxides fig 2 the rates and extents of se removal were remarkably similar fig 5c under fully oxic and partially oxic conditions different densities of reddish brown suspensions were produced while at strictly anoxic conditions a pale blue green suspension formed that was probably green rust fig s5 these different products indicate that se removal at ph 6 was not driven solely by the identity of the iron containing solid the lower the do concentrations at ph 6 the more se remains as se0 lcf fitting table 1 of the xanes spectra fig 6 show that the se0 portion of the solid product was higher for strictly anoxic conditions than for partially oxic conditions the xanes results for the partially oxic conditions show that substantial amounts of se iv 65 and se vi 22 were present in the solid at these conditions more iron containing solids were produced as well fig 2b the large difference in the concentrations of dissolved se and acid soluble se under partially oxic conditions can be attributed to precipitation of se iv or se vi with solid phase iron or the adsorption of se iv to freshly formed iron oxide or oxyhydroxide solids ferrous selenite could potentially form fig 4 and ferric selenite has been observed in the oxidation zones of selenide containing ores in the environment as the mineral mandarinoite fe2 seo3 3 5h2o s lelet et al 2018 previous studies demonstrated that se iv adsorption to metal oxides including iron oxides is favorable peak 2006 su and suarez 2000 3 4 comparison of se removal by iron electrocoagulation and by pre formed fe ii containing solids results of control experiments with dissolved fe ii and with pre synthesized fe ii containing solids were compared with those from iron electrocoagulation to yield insights into the mechanisms of se removal fig 7 here we tested only the strictly anoxic condition because it was most favorable for dissolved se removal dissolved se removal by reaction with either pre synthesized fe oh 2 s or green rust was not as effective as by electrocoagulation at ph 8 and strictly anoxic conditions after 120 min of reaction the dissolved se concentrations for fe oh 2 s and green rust were respectively 535 and 157 μg l as se fig 7a while se was below detection 0 1 µg l after 120 min of electrocoagulation at ph 8 fig 5a xanes results table 1 fig 6c show that even though chemically synthesized green rust enables the formation of se0 and selenide the transformation extent is not as high as in the electrocoagulation process myneni et al 1997 found that even though selenite transformation to selenide is thermodynamically favorable in the presence of chemically synthesized green rust selenide was not observed as the dominant species unless fe ii exists in high concentrations this earlier study also found that dissolved fe ii alone cannot remove the dissolved se vi fig 7a at ph 6 a finding consistent with our work an additional factor unique to electrocoagulation appears to contribute to dissolved se removal this is discussed further in section 3 5 chemically synthesized green rust is more effective than chemically synthesized fe oh 2 s in terms of both the rates and extents of dissolved se removal at ph 8 and anoxic conditions fig 7a a substantial amount of dissolved se is immediately removed when green rust is used confirming the effectiveness of green rust for se species removal fig 7a the lcf results in table 1 showed that at ph 8 green rust produces a higher portion 22 of selenide than is produced by reaction with fe oh 2 s 8 while fe oh 2 s produces more se0 73 than does green rust 62 with similar amounts of selenite present in both solids in the batch with pre synthesized fe oh 2 s the average acid soluble suspended se concentration the difference between unfiltered and filtered acidified samples becomes stable after 10 min 446 30 4 μg l fig s8a in addition at ph 6 green rust produced less selenide 12 and se0 22 and more selenite 52 than at ph 8 xanes results at this condition table 1 fig 6c showed that se iv was the dominant species suggesting that green rust might initially act as an adsorbent before reduction proceeds at ph 6 3 5 unique influence of iron electrocoagulation to confirm the contribution of freshly formed iron containing solids on the electrode surfaces the se deposited on the electrodes surfaces by electrocoagulation under strictly anoxic and partial oxic conditions at both ph 6 and 8 was analyzed the deposits contained 39 54 µg of se which is up to 20 of the initial se in the solution fig 8 more se was observed on the anode than on the cathode the influence of freshly formed green rust or another form of reductive iron solid formed on the iron rod plays a more important role than that of any direct electron transfer from the cathode to se vi in removing dissolved se because the experiments at fully oxic and partially oxic conditions had both constant current and constant voltage any deposits on the anode or cathode had negligible effects on the electrode overpotentials reduction of dissolved oxygen on the cathode is thermodynamically more favorable than the reduction of se vi to less oxidized species table s2 thus at fully oxic and partially oxic conditions se vi reduction on the cathode is not essential to complete the electrochemical process since dissolved oxygen as well as h are both abundant electron acceptors the measurement of the electrochemical potential of the cathode at ph 6 and oxic conditions of 3 89 v is consistent with the ability to reduce both dissolved oxygen and se vi the formation of bubbles on the cathode surface during electrocoagulation at strictly anoxic conditions indicates that reduction of h to generate h2 g on the cathode is thermodynamically favorable since electrochemical potentials of se vi reduction to se ii are higher than those of water reduction to h2 g se vi reduction on the cathode is also thermodynamically favorable despite se vi reduction on the cathode being thermodynamically favorable almost no se deposited and accumulated on the cathode fig 8 the nature of an electrocoagulation reactor acting as an electrochemical cell results in local ph values near the electrodes that are different from those in the bulk solution ingelsson et al 2020 green rust formation is more favorable at elevated ph and the locally high ph near the cathode could have promoted green rust nucleation that might not have occurred as rapidly at the ph of the bulk solution while se did not deposit on the cathode the high ph in the vicinity of the cathode could have promoted green rust nucleation 3 6 fate of the dissolved se substantial removal of dissolved se was achieved through iron electrocoagulation including up to 100 at ph 8 under anoxic conditions regardless of the ph or do acid soluble se decreased to less than 44 of the initial amount fig 5b d suggesting that at least 56 of the removed dissolved se is in a form that cannot be recovered upon acidification of unfiltered samples se took a form other than suspended se0 at ph 8 little se0 was detected based on xanes table 1 the se concentration in the batch suspension after reaction for 2 h was less than the original concentration even after treatment with naocl done to oxidize reduced forms of se fig s9 these observations suggest that dissolved or suspended se was not in the suspension after the reaction the most likely possibility is the se deposition on the surface of the electrode that was discussed earlier another possibility is that some se was volatilized as hydrogen selenide h2se our xanes results fig 6 showed that selenide was produced as a result of iron electrocoagulation even though the pka1 of h2se is low 3 85 table s3 a small amount of h2se could escape to the atmosphere due to its high volatility k h 8 4 10 2 m atm sander 1999 wilhelm et al 1977 and the active sparging of the reactor contents because of the toxicity of h2se future work should test for the formation of h2se using available approaches tan et al 2003 there is also a possibility that dissolved selenide was lost by volatilization after acidification pretreatment for icp ms analyses 3 7 components of acid soluble suspended solid phase se the acid soluble suspended se concentration was highest for the strictly anoxic condition at ph 8 fig s8b at this condition the selenide proportion of the suspended solids was 90 table 1 the acid soluble suspended se concentration was the lowest at the ph 6 strictly anoxic condition and at this condition the dominant form of se in the suspended solids was se0 for ph 6 and 8 at partially oxic conditions the acid soluble suspended se concentrations were higher than those at the ph 6 strictly anoxic condition these findings indicated that conditions that favor the formation of se0 yield solids with the lowest acid soluble se concentrations 3 8 strategies for full scale deployment and integration of electrocoagulation into a treatment train iron electrocoagulation can continuously provide freshly formed fe ii containing solids i e green rust or fe oh 2 s at low dissolved oxygen concentrations iron electrocoagulation can rapidly treat dissolved se laden waters to achieve low dissolved se concentrations unlike chemical addition processes the fe ii dose can be controlled by varying the voltage applied to the electrodes which may offer advantages for use in decentralized treatment where its modular nature may be best suited to the volumes being treated holt et al 2005 by controlling the ph and do the process can be tuned to produce the most reactive phases for se removal another advantage is that it can introduce fe ii without also introducing a counter ion e g sulfate or chloride as would occur if fe ii containing reagents e g feso4 or fecl2 were used in this way the total dissolved solids of the system will not increase as much as in chemical coagulation even though iron electrocoagulation for selenium removal can be useful in many industries several factors need to be examined for full scale deployment first diverse industrial water compositions e g ca2 and so4 2 need to be taken into account for example wastewater from flue gas desulfurization contains high concentrations of sulfate buecker 2011 that may affect se removal sulfate can play a pivotal role in determining what iron containing solids form during electrocoagulation dubrawski et al 2015 and dissolved inorganic carbon can also affect what solids form we speculate that green rust formation was facilitated by the low dissolved inorganic carbon in the solution and controlling ph dubrawski et al 2015 found that green rust formed under conditions of 5 mm nacl ph 7 7 5 and do 5 they also observed that the absence of dissolved inorganic carbon provided favorable conditions for forming green rust instead of other iron compounds e g magnetite the electricity demand of the process needs to be considered in a 120 min experiment the total electric power used to treat a 500 ml batch was approximately 0 96 wh or 1 92 kwh m3 at the best condition studied the dissolved se decreased below detection limits within 60 min which would be 1 0 kwh m3 the electricity consumption of the overall iron electrocoagulation process could be higher than what is needed for conventional drinking water treatment about 0 04 0 16 kwh m3 epri 2009 howe et al 2012 but it is lower than values for reverse osmosis desalination of seawater 2 5 4 0 kwh m3 voutchkov 2018 power consumption of actual electrocoagulation treatment units can be optimized by modifications of the reactor geometry another issue for full scale deployment is the management of reduced se containing solids and dissolved fe after electrocoagulation se containing solids e g mainly se0 or fese s must be removed via physical separation from the reactor after removal of se containing solids the dissolved fe remaining in solution may need to be removed depending on the desired end uses of the water the portion of fe in the suspension that is dissolved is higher at conditions of low dissolved oxygen dissolved fe can be transformed into solid phases by ph adjustment and reaeration fig 2 shows that even partially oxic conditions can convert most of the iron into solid phases at ph 8 once transformed into solids iron containing suspended solids can be removed from the treated water se and fe containing solids remained after electrocoagulation will need to be removed from suspension by sedimentation e g plate setters howe et al 2012 or pressure driven membrane processes benjamin and lawler 2013 the choice of these removal process will be impacted by the properties of the solids sedimentation will require the suspended solids to have sufficiently high density and particle sizes and these properties may be affected by the water chemistry and electrocoagulation operating conditions if removal by sedimentation is not feasible then microfiltration or ultrafiltration can be used depending on the sizes of the se containing solids 4 conclusions our study investigated the impacts of dissolved oxygen and ph on dissolved selenate and selenite removal by iron electrocoagulation fig 9 we discovered that the rate and extent of dissolved se removal were highest under strictly anoxic conditions at ph 8 the solid characterization results showed that dissolved se primarily transformed to se0 and selenide the green rust and fe oh 2 s that formed in the suspension during electrocoagulation probably acted as reductants for the se vi and se iv overall we found that freshly formed reductive iron species achieved the most rapid and substantial dissolved

16239,removing dissolved selenium i e selenate and selenite from wastewater is a challenging issue for a range of industries iron electrocoagulation can produce fe ii containing solids that can adsorb and chemically reduce dissolved se in a series of bench scale experiments we investigated the effects of dissolved oxygen fully oxic partially oxic and strictly anoxic and ph 6 and 8 on the rate and extent of dissolved selenate and selenite removal by iron electrocoagulation these studies combined measurements of the aqueous phase with the direct characterization of the resulting solids among the conditions studied the rate and extent of dissolved selenium se removal were highest at ph 8 and strictly anoxic conditions x ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that in the absence of oxygen se was primarily transformed to elemental selenium se0 and selenide green rust that formed in the suspension during electrocoagulation played a key role as a reductant and sorbent of se at ph 6 dissolved oxygen did not affect the rates and extents of dissolved se removal under all the conditions studied dissolved se removal was more effective with iron electrocoagulation than with the direct addition of pre synthesized green rust or ferrous hydroxide the most rapid and substantial dissolved se removal was achieved by freshly formed green rust and ferrous hydroxide which are both fe ii bearing solids with an improved understanding of the products and mechanisms of the process iron electrocoagulation can be optimized for removal of se from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved selenium iron electrocoagulation ph dissolved oxygen green rust 1 introduction selenium se accumulation in aquatic environments can negatively impact humans and aquatic

lindberg et al 2011 ohlendorf et al 1986 who 1996 the maximum contaminant level for se in u s drinking water is 50 μg l u s epa 2016 the sources of se to aquatic environments include runoff from

associated with the processing and use of coal moore and mahmoudkhani 2011 flue gas desulfurization operations that control so2 emissions from coal fired power plants remove se and sulfur species from exhaust gases simultaneously which results in wastewaters that can be particularly rich in selenite buecker 2011 waters generated in the mining agricultural and power sectors contain selenium over a broad range of concentrations from about 10 µg l in landfill leachates to more than 1000 µg l in flue gas desulfurization wastewaters golder associates ltd 2020 current effluent limits are as low as 5

and selenite are more soluble and mobile than the less oxidized species mayland et al 1991 selenate in particular is more mobile than other se species and is resistant to removal by adsorption oremland et al 1990 sheoran and sheoran 2006 previous research has examined dissolved se adsorption to iron oxides lounsbury et al 2019 peak and sparks 2002 aluminium oxides yamani et al 2014 and cement minerals baur and johnson 2003 however adsorption alone has shown little success in selenate removal sheoran and sheoran 2006 treatment can be accomplished by microbial reduction of dissolved se vi and se iv to se0 oremland et al 1990 rittmann 2018 commercially available selenium removal systems are largely biologically based these approaches face challenges of stable performance with variable influent composition and intermittent operations temperature dependent performance especially for cold regions and the generation of bioavailable organoselenium species gingerich et al 2018 golder associates ltd 2020 chemical reduction can transform dissolved se into less soluble reduced forms myneni et al 1997 effective reductants include zero valent iron shrimpton et al 2015 fe ii

valent iron has been deployed as a commercially available technology but it lacks precision for selenate removal as its reduction capacity is consumed by nitrate and even water itself some emerging technologies are focusing on electrochemical reduction zou and mauter 2021 reduction of dissolved se can also be achieved using sulfur based reductants e g dithionite sulfide and some of these reactions are accelerated by photochemical processes jung et al 2016 jung et al 2018 electrocoagulation is a commercially available technology that has been examined for the removal of metals and metalloids from water holt et al 2005 iron electrocoagulation can potentially treat the dissolved se in wastewaters by producing iron containing suspended solids that are effective reductants or adsorbents symonds et al 2015 recent research found that fe ii released during iron electrocoagulation chemically reduced cr vi to less soluble cr iii species that eventually precipitate with iron oxides adhoum et al 2004 pan et al 2016 iron electrocoagulation produces high surface area iron oxides that are also effective adsorbents for the removal of dissolved arsenic species bandaru et al 2020 catrouillet et al 2020 van genuchten et al 2012 wan et al 2011 wang and giammar 2015 the generation of fe ii and its subsequent oxidation to fe iii during iron electrocoagulation could facilitate the removal of se vi from solution specifically fe ii bearing solids could be generated that are effective chemical reductants of se vi and se iv that then retain the reduced forms of se by adsorption incorporation or precipitation some previous studies observed that electrode spacing anode cathode position and contact time can affect dissolved selenate removal using iron electrocoagulation baek et al 2013a 2013b these studies found that the selenate removal rates were significantly affected by the initial selenate concentration electric current and presence of other anions nevertheless there had been no prior systematic investigation of the effect of oxygen level and ph on se removal by iron electrocoagulation in this study oxygen level and ph were prioritized for investigation because of their strong influence on the concentrations and speciation of dissolved and solid phase iron species produced and the impact of iron speciation on selenium removal because reduction of se vi is likely a critical initial step in se vi removal in iron electrocoagulation it is important to explore the competition between se vi and dissolved oxygen for reaction with the fe ii generated in iron electrocoagulation the rates of fe ii oxidation by dissolved oxygen are strongly ph and oxygen level dependent in our previous study of cr vi removal with iron electrocoagulation ph and dissolved oxygen level controlled overall cr vi removal through their influence on the relative rates of cr vi and dissolved oxygen reaction with fe ii pan et al 2016 furthermore previous studies baek et al 2013a 2013b had not identified the specific selenium containing products formed by iron electrocoagulation during selenate removal the goal of this study was to determine the impacts of dissolved oxygen and ph on the rate extent and products of dissolved se removal during iron electrocoagulation a specific focus was placed on how ph and dissolved oxygen levels influenced the iron containing solids that were produced and the role of those solids in the removal of dissolved se the differences between dissolved se removal during iron electrocoagulation and the direct addition of fe ii containing solutions and solids were also examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in experiments and analyses were reagents of high purity specific information about these chemicals is presented in section s1 of the supplementary materials the ph buffer 2 n morpholino ethanesulfonic acid mes was selected because it does not affect the adsorption of metals onto iron oxides ferreira et al 2015 soares et al 2000 we note that a recent study observed the production of different iron oxyhydroxides from zero valent iron depending on the conditions of sulfonic acid buffers including mes he et al 2018 all solutions for stocks were prepared with ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm 2 2 iron electrocoagulation batch experiments the batch solution was composed of 0 0140 mm seo4 2 1 10 mg l as se 10 mm nacl and 2 mm mes for all ph and dissolved oxygen conditions the electrocoagulation reactor contained two iron rods serving as both anode and cathode in a 500 ml borosilicate glass beaker with the batch solution fig 1 a each rod had an initial immersed surface area of 23 6 cm2 diameter 1 7 cm immersed length 4 0 cm the rods were placed 5 cm apart in the solution prior to each experiment the electrode surfaces were cleaned with sandpaper a voltage of 8 v was applied to the electrodes from a direct current dc power supply for 120 min for each batch experiment this voltage was within the range used in previous studies and the 120 min duration provided a good temporal resolution of the changes in selenium concentrations since the initial current of 60 ma 2 54 ma cm2 tended to drift up during the reaction the value was maintained by decreasing the contact area of the immersed iron rods during each experiment for those experiments in which the current density changed in order to allow operation at constant voltage and current the overpotentials on the electrodes were also changing since the solution resistance remained essentially constant during the reaction the solution was mixed by a magnetic stirrer and stir bar at regular intervals during electrocoagulation 11 ml volumes of suspension were collected of these volumes 6 ml was filtered using a 0 2 μm polyethersulfone filter membrane tisch scientific and 5 ml was kept as an unfiltered sample all the samples were acidified by adding concentrated nitric acid to provide 1 of hno3 by mass in the samples prior to analysis at the end of each batch experiment the suspended solids present in the reactor were collected for solid phase characterization during iron electrocoagulation dissolved se transformed into several different forms including suspended solid phases that were classified as either acid soluble or non acid soluble fig 1b the total se that was present as dissolved species and in acid soluble suspended solids was measured by acidifying an unfiltered sample additional details are in section s2 the differences in se concentrations between the unfiltered and filtered samples give the concentration of acid soluble suspended se fig 1b the fractions of the initially added se that were not recovered upon acidification of the unfiltered samples were either se species not soluble in nitric acid or se species no longer contained in the suspension electrocoagulation experiments were conducted at three different oxygen levels strictly anoxic partially oxic and fully oxic conditions and two different ph values ph 6 and 8 the ph conditions selected are relevant to water treatment the range of ph of flue gas desulfurization wastewater is between 4 5 and 9 higgins et al 2009 the two ph values considered in our study ph 6 and 8 have vastly different rates of fe ii oxidation in the presence of dissolved oxygen the experiments with the strictly anoxic condition were performed in an oxygen free anaerobic chamber 97 n2 and 3 h2 the dissolved oxygen concentration was monitored for the anoxic condition setup and was always found to be below the detection limit 0 08 mg l of our optical do probe ecosense odo200 ysi which corresponds to po2 less than 0 0019 atm and an eh for the o2 h2o couple less than 0 83 v at ph 6 partially oxic and fully oxic experiments were performed outside of the anaerobic chamber under partially oxic conditions the solution was sparged with a mixture of pure nitrogen 290 ml min and air 10 ml min that maintained do at 0 32 0 22 mg l po2 of 0 0077 0 0053 atm and eh of the o2 h2o couple of 0 84 v at ph 6 under fully oxic conditions po2 of 0 21 atm and eh of the o2 h2o couple of 0 86 v at ph 6 the solution was sparged with air at a flow rate of 300 ml min to continuously resupply do consumed during the process the solutions sparged with air would have more dissolved inorganic carbon than those performed in the glove box or with nitrogen sparging suggesting that the strictly anoxic condition had little dissolved inorganic carbon the ph of the solution was repeatedly measured and readjusted back to within 0 4 units of the target ph during the experiment by adding hcl or naoh because of the greater buffering capacity of mes pka 6 15 at ph 6 the ph varied less at ph 6 than it did at ph 8 the current was briefly turned off less than one minute during the times when the ph was measured because the current interfered with the ph measurement duplicate runs were performed for each set of experimental conditions after the reaction we collected deposits on the anode and cathode by scraping them off with sandpaper these solids were oxidized in a solution of 0 0403 m naocl for 24 h to convert adsorbed se compounds into soluble forms and the resulting solution was analyzed to measure the total selenium mass deposited on each electrode the overpotentials of the anode and cathode at ph 6 and fully oxic conditions were measured for conditions of constant current 60 ma in experiments with 120 min durations measurements used a potentiostat gamry reference 600 and a ag agcl kcl reference electrode section s3 the distance between the reference electrode and working electrode during measurements was approximately 0 2 cm which would result in negligible solution resistance between the reference and working electrodes 2 3 control experiments with chemical addition of fe ii containing species control experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of dissolved and solid phase iron species on dissolved se removal in the absence of electric current in these experiments either dissolved fe ii or pre synthesized fe ii containing solids were directly added to the glass beaker instead of producing them in situ by electrocoagulation total iron concentrations used in the control experiments were selected to be comparable to the amounts generated in the 120 min iron electrocoagulation experiments control experiments with dissolved fe ii were performed under strictly anoxic conditions at ph 6 control experiments using pre synthesized green rust or fe oh 2 s were performed under strictly anoxic conditions at ph 8 in these experiments green rust or fe oh 2 s was first precipitated and then a selenate solution was added to the suspension section s4 describes the methods for synthesizing and identifying green rust and fe oh 2 s 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of fe and se were determined by icp ms elan drc ii perkinelmer the instrument detection limits for se and fe were 0 1 μg l and 10 μg l respectively in addition to measurements of total and dissolved iron concentration the dissolved fe ii concentration was also measured using the ferrozine method on samples immediately after their collection viollier et al 2000 x ray absorption spectroscopy xas was used to determine the oxidation state of se in the collected solid phase products selenium k edge x ray absorption spectra were obtained at beamlines 5 bm d and 20 bm b at the advanced photon source the main peak in the first derivative of the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectrum of se0 was set to 12 660 2 ev to obtain relative quantities of se in different oxidation states background subtraction averaging normalization and linear combination fitting lcf were done through the athena interface ravel and newville 2005 more detailed information on xas sample preparation and interpretation including the selection of reference materials necessary for lcf is provided in section s5 x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation was used to identify crystalline solid phases produced in the iron electrocoagulation and control experiments additional information on the procedures for x ray absorption spectroscopy and xrd analyses is provided in section s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 iron containing solids produced from iron electrocoagulation more than 250 mg l of total iron was generated over the 120 min experiment fig 2 released as dissolved fe ii from the anode the dissolved fe ii could then transform into fe ii or fe iii containing solids based on the oxygen level and ph at the cathode the most likely reaction was a reduction of h to yield hydrogen sawyer et al 2003 total released iron concentrations were compared with predictions based on faraday s law 1 m fe m w fe i t z f where m fe is the amount of iron released from the iron anode mg mw fe is the molecular weight of iron 55 845 mg mol i is the current amperes which is the same as c s t is time s z is the number of electrons transferred per iron atom released from the iron rod here z is 2 and f is faraday s constant 96 485 c mol calculated total fe concentrations were obtained by dividing m fe by the batch volume 500 ml there was good agreement between the total iron concentrations and the predictions from faraday s law in experiments with stable currents the current remained stable in the fully oxic and partially oxic experiments fig s4 having both stable current and voltage indicates that the electrode overpotentials were unaffected by changes in surface structures e g passivation or depassivation over the duration of the experiments ingelsson et al 2020 in separate measurements made in a constant current mode at ph 6 and fully oxic conditions the anode electrode overpotential was measured as approximately 1 55 v and the cathode overpotential was approximately 3 89 v fig s2 in the experiments performed at strictly anoxic conditions the current was stable at 60 ma 2 54 2 66 ma cm2 for the first 60 min but it then fluctuated between 60 90 ma 2 54 4 29 ma cm2 at ph 6 and 70 90 ma 3 34 4 29 ma cm2 at ph 8 for the last 60 min fig s4 such increases in current and current density mean that the solution resistance is increasing for this to occur while maintaining a constant applied potential indicates that the electrode overpotentials are decreasing over time a decrease in the electrode overpotentials could be associated with the depassivation of the anode surface that may occur as a microscopic iron oxide layer is released to solution as the anode corrodes and that cannot be regenerated at strictly anoxic conditions further investigation in future studies may yield insights into what processes occurred in strictly anoxic condition that induced current variation the range of the current density was given because the contact area of the immersed iron rods was decreasing during the electrocoagulation the change of the current density could affect any se removal that is associated with direct reaction on the electrodes the formation of particular phases of iron containing solids was controlled by the ph oxygen levels and presence of selenate at ph 8 under strictly anoxic conditions equilibrium calculations indicate that fe oh 2 s formation is thermodynamically favorable fig s3 for the iron ii concentrations generated approximately 30 of released fe from the iron rod was transformed into a fe ii containing solid fig 2 depending on the water treatment objectives the remaining dissolved fe may need to be removed in subsequent steps of an overall treatment train post electrocoagulation processes are discussed in section 3 8 at ph 8 under strictly anoxic conditions without selenate a white precipitate formed during electrocoagulation fig s5a xrd patterns indicate that this white precipitate was fe oh 2 s with possible trace amounts of feroxyhyte δ feo oh fig s6 when selenate was present at this same condition of ph 8 and strictly anoxic conditions a blue green suspension indicative of green rust formed xrd patterns fig 3 a confirmed that the blue greenish suspension obtained after the electrocoagulation reaction contained green rust together with fe oh 2 s the xrd patterns for these samples were relatively weak which was probably due to the small amount of sample available for analysis 100 130 mg as fe as well as the poorly crystalline nature of the solids the broad scattering profile between 20 and 40 probably indicates moisture contained in the slurry lad et al 2013 or amorphous materials the formation of feroxyhyte in this condition likely occurred due to oxidation during the xrd analyses jurkin et al 2016 since green rust is highly unstable in the atmosphere we prepared samples in a manner that protected them from contact with air and we analyzed them within 1 h of sample preparation specific procedures are described in section s5 in supplementary materials green rust is a phase often observed during iron electrocoagulation at low dissolved oxygen conditions dubrawski et al 2015 although a recent study found that green rust may form from fe oh 2 without an oxidant other than water tosca et al 2018 several other studies determined that se vi can promote the initiation of green rust formation from fe oh 2 s at anoxic conditions by oxidation of a portion of fe ii to fe iii refait et al 1997 refait et al 2000 based on the xrd pattern the initial green rust was chloride green rust which is also the solid that was synthesized from chemical reagents at similar conditions for use in this study fig s6 while selenate green rust has formed in other studies its xrd pattern is distinct from that of chloride green rust refait et al 2000 based on the pe ph diagram fig 4 green rust is the predicted phase at the most highly reducing conditions after reaction with se vi there is the potential for selenate green rust formation which has been observed in previous research on green rust reactions with se vi at conditions similar to those in this study myneni et al 1997 the dynamics of selenium and iron uptake by the solid phases at ph 8 and anoxic conditions are also consistent with the formation of green rust this can be illustrated by examining the concentrations of dissolved and total selenium after 40 min of reaction which is near the end of the period of the most rapid removal of selenium from the solution at this point 1000 µg l of se 0 0127 mm had been lost from solution fig 5 and the solids are likely to contain approximately 20 mg l of fe 0 36 mm difference between total fe ii produced and measured dissolved fe in fig 2 xanes results fig 6 indicate that se ii was the dominant form of se in the solids generated during this reaction considering se ii as the dominant form we can determine that 0 10 mm of fe ii would have been oxidized to fe iii upon reaction with 0 0127 mm se vi i e 8 electrons per mole of se vi reduced this oxidation could result in a solid with a fe ii fe iii ratio of 2 6 1 which is in the range observed for green rust refait et al 2000 however fe oh 2 s might become dominant at the end of the reaction because solid phase fe ii was several times higher than what is needed for the complete reduction of the se vi species in the reactor specific calculations describing the solid phase fe ii amount necessary for complete se vi reduction are shown in section s7 under partially oxic or fully oxic conditions at ph 8 more than 99 of the dissolved iron transformed into solid phases resulting in dissolved iron concentrations below 5 mg l throughout the reaction fig 2a as expected for iron in the presence of dissolved oxygen fig 4 the dissolved fe ii released from the anode was oxidized by dissolved oxygen to fe iii that precipitate as oxyhydroxide solids xrd patterns of green rust fe oh 2 s ferrihydrite and feroxyhyte were detected in solids generated during electrocoagulation at partially oxic conditions at ph 8 fig 3b here the intensities of feroxyhyte peaks were higher than those at strictly anoxic ph 8 condition the formation of feroxyhyte was probably influenced by the reaction of iron oxides or dissolved fe ii with trace oxygen in the batch during the electrocoagulation olowe et al 1994 as well as by oxidation during the solid sample preparation and xrd analyses jurkin et al 2016 more discussion of the xrd patterns of partially oxic and fully oxic conditions is provided in section s8 under strictly anoxic conditions approximately 99 9 of the released fe persisted in the dissolved phase at ph 6 under partially oxic and fully oxic conditions 23 7 and 97 4 of released fe transformed into the solid phase respectively fig 2b ferrozine analyses of samples from experiments at strictly anoxic conditions revealed that essentially all 99 9 of the dissolved iron was fe ii in experiments at both ph 6 and 8 3 2 effects of oxygen level on dissolved se removal at ph 8 the rate and extent of dissolved se removal were highest under strictly anoxic conditions at ph 8 fig 5a under these conditions it took less than 60 min for the dissolved se concentration to fall below the detection limit of 0 1 µg l the extent of dissolved se removal decreased when the do concentration increased even slightly fig 5a at a partially oxic condition with do less than 0 08 mg l the dissolved se concentration dropped from 1100 to 212 μg l 80 7 mol mol removed after 120 min in both the fully oxic condition do 8 0 8 7 mg l and partially oxic condition with do of 0 3 mg l the dissolved se concentrations were still 600 μg l 45 5 mol mol removed after 120 min the limited removal of dissolved se at these do levels and ph 8 is probably due to the consumption of fe ii by oxidation with do that dramatically decreases the available fe ii for reaction with se vi regardless of the do at ph 8 the se concentrations in acid soluble samples decreased linearly versus time fig 5b the average unfiltered se concentration after 120 min for the three do levels was 497 28 4 μg l which indicates that about 54 of the initial dissolved se was converted into a form that was not acid soluble the acid dissolution tests fig s7 confirmed that se0 exists in the solid phase under all experimental conditions and does not dissolve in acid digestion equilibrium calculations fig 4 also showed that se0 dissolution is not favorable under acidic conditions this trend indicates that se0 or other forms that could not be dissolved upon acid addition e g attached on the wall or volatilized formed during electrocoagulation se that could not be accounted for upon acid addition in collected samples of suspension had probably become associated with the iron anode and cathode and was simply not present in the suspension at ph 8 the sum of se deposition on the anode and cathode was 13 8 41 7 µg depending on the oxygen level se deposition on the iron electrodes is discussed further in section 3 6 solid phase products collected after electrocoagulation treatments were further characterized by xanes analyses fig 6 lcf was carried out to determine the relative amounts of se in different oxidation states table 1 at strictly anoxic conditions se in the solid products was predominantly present as a selenide phase 91 this is consistent with fese s being the thermodynamically most stable form of se at ph 8 and at reducing conditions fig 4 and with observations from previous studies of se iv reaction with other fe ii containing solids scheinost and charlet 2008 at partially oxic conditions most se was still selenate 67 with smaller portions as selenite 22 or selenide 11 se vi in the solid products of iron electrocoagulation at partially oxic conditions was probably adsorbed to fe iii containing solids 3 3 effects of oxygen level on se removal at ph 6 at ph 6 the dissolved se removal rate and extent during electrocoagulation were practically independent of do fig 5c the remaining dissolved se concentrations after 120 min ranged from 36 to 236 μg l as se a much narrower range than that observed for ph 8 for fully oxic partially oxic and strictly anoxic conditions the dissolved se concentration decreased almost linearly over 20 60 min at 12 7 10 6 and 11 6 μg l min respectively although different do levels produced different phases of iron oxides fig 2 the rates and extents of se removal were remarkably similar fig 5c under fully oxic and partially oxic conditions different densities of reddish brown suspensions were produced while at strictly anoxic conditions a pale blue green suspension formed that was probably green rust fig s5 these different products indicate that se removal at ph 6 was not driven solely by the identity of the iron containing solid the lower the do concentrations at ph 6 the more se remains as se0 lcf fitting table 1 of the xanes spectra fig 6 show that the se0 portion of the solid product was higher for strictly anoxic conditions than for partially oxic conditions the xanes results for the partially oxic conditions show that substantial amounts of se iv 65 and se vi 22 were present in the solid at these conditions more iron containing solids were produced as well fig 2b the large difference in the concentrations of dissolved se and acid soluble se under partially oxic conditions can be attributed to precipitation of se iv or se vi with solid phase iron or the adsorption of se iv to freshly formed iron oxide or oxyhydroxide solids ferrous selenite could potentially form fig 4 and ferric selenite has been observed in the oxidation zones of selenide containing ores in the environment as the mineral mandarinoite fe2 seo3 3 5h2o s lelet et al 2018 previous studies demonstrated that se iv adsorption to metal oxides including iron oxides is favorable peak 2006 su and suarez 2000 3 4 comparison of se removal by iron electrocoagulation and by pre formed fe ii containing solids results of control experiments with dissolved fe ii and with pre synthesized fe ii containing solids were compared with those from iron electrocoagulation to yield insights into the mechanisms of se removal fig 7 here we tested only the strictly anoxic condition because it was most favorable for dissolved se removal dissolved se removal by reaction with either pre synthesized fe oh 2 s or green rust was not as effective as by electrocoagulation at ph 8 and strictly anoxic conditions after 120 min of reaction the dissolved se concentrations for fe oh 2 s and green rust were respectively 535 and 157 μg l as se fig 7a while se was below detection 0 1 µg l after 120 min of electrocoagulation at ph 8 fig 5a xanes results table 1 fig 6c show that even though chemically synthesized green rust enables the formation of se0 and selenide the transformation extent is not as high as in the electrocoagulation process myneni et al 1997 found that even though selenite transformation to selenide is thermodynamically favorable in the presence of chemically synthesized green rust selenide was not observed as the dominant species unless fe ii exists in high concentrations this earlier study also found that dissolved fe ii alone cannot remove the dissolved se vi fig 7a at ph 6 a finding consistent with our work an additional factor unique to electrocoagulation appears to contribute to dissolved se removal this is discussed further in section 3 5 chemically synthesized green rust is more effective than chemically synthesized fe oh 2 s in terms of both the rates and extents of dissolved se removal at ph 8 and anoxic conditions fig 7a a substantial amount of dissolved se is immediately removed when green rust is used confirming the effectiveness of green rust for se species removal fig 7a the lcf results in table 1 showed that at ph 8 green rust produces a higher portion 22 of selenide than is produced by reaction with fe oh 2 s 8 while fe oh 2 s produces more se0 73 than does green rust 62 with similar amounts of selenite present in both solids in the batch with pre synthesized fe oh 2 s the average acid soluble suspended se concentration the difference between unfiltered and filtered acidified samples becomes stable after 10 min 446 30 4 μg l fig s8a in addition at ph 6 green rust produced less selenide 12 and se0 22 and more selenite 52 than at ph 8 xanes results at this condition table 1 fig 6c showed that se iv was the dominant species suggesting that green rust might initially act as an adsorbent before reduction proceeds at ph 6 3 5 unique influence of iron electrocoagulation to confirm the contribution of freshly formed iron containing solids on the electrode surfaces the se deposited on the electrodes surfaces by electrocoagulation under strictly anoxic and partial oxic conditions at both ph 6 and 8 was analyzed the deposits contained 39 54 µg of se which is up to 20 of the initial se in the solution fig 8 more se was observed on the anode than on the cathode the influence of freshly formed green rust or another form of reductive iron solid formed on the iron rod plays a more important role than that of any direct electron transfer from the cathode to se vi in removing dissolved se because the experiments at fully oxic and partially oxic conditions had both constant current and constant voltage any deposits on the anode or cathode had negligible effects on the electrode overpotentials reduction of dissolved oxygen on the cathode is thermodynamically more favorable than the reduction of se vi to less oxidized species table s2 thus at fully oxic and partially oxic conditions se vi reduction on the cathode is not essential to complete the electrochemical process since dissolved oxygen as well as h are both abundant electron acceptors the measurement of the electrochemical potential of the cathode at ph 6 and oxic conditions of 3 89 v is consistent with the ability to reduce both dissolved oxygen and se vi the formation of bubbles on the cathode surface during electrocoagulation at strictly anoxic conditions indicates that reduction of h to generate h2 g on the cathode is thermodynamically favorable since electrochemical potentials of se vi reduction to se ii are higher than those of water reduction to h2 g se vi reduction on the cathode is also thermodynamically favorable despite se vi reduction on the cathode being thermodynamically favorable almost no se deposited and accumulated on the cathode fig 8 the nature of an electrocoagulation reactor acting as an electrochemical cell results in local ph values near the electrodes that are different from those in the bulk solution ingelsson et al 2020 green rust formation is more favorable at elevated ph and the locally high ph near the cathode could have promoted green rust nucleation that might not have occurred as rapidly at the ph of the bulk solution while se did not deposit on the cathode the high ph in the vicinity of the cathode could have promoted green rust nucleation 3 6 fate of the dissolved se substantial removal of dissolved se was achieved through iron electrocoagulation including up to 100 at ph 8 under anoxic conditions regardless of the ph or do acid soluble se decreased to less than 44 of the initial amount fig 5b d suggesting that at least 56 of the removed dissolved se is in a form that cannot be recovered upon acidification of unfiltered samples se took a form other than suspended se0 at ph 8 little se0 was detected based on xanes table 1 the se concentration in the batch suspension after reaction for 2 h was less than the original concentration even after treatment with naocl done to oxidize reduced forms of se fig s9 these observations suggest that dissolved or suspended se was not in the suspension after the reaction the most likely possibility is the se deposition on the surface of the electrode that was discussed earlier another possibility is that some se was volatilized as hydrogen selenide h2se our xanes results fig 6 showed that selenide was produced as a result of iron electrocoagulation even though the pka1 of h2se is low 3 85 table s3 a small amount of h2se could escape to the atmosphere due to its high volatility k h 8 4 10 2 m atm sander 1999 wilhelm et al 1977 and the active sparging of the reactor contents because of the toxicity of h2se future work should test for the formation of h2se using available approaches tan et al 2003 there is also a possibility that dissolved selenide was lost by volatilization after acidification pretreatment for icp ms analyses 3 7 components of acid soluble suspended solid phase se the acid soluble suspended se concentration was highest for the strictly anoxic condition at ph 8 fig s8b at this condition the selenide proportion of the suspended solids was 90 table 1 the acid soluble suspended se concentration was the lowest at the ph 6 strictly anoxic condition and at this condition the dominant form of se in the suspended solids was se0 for ph 6 and 8 at partially oxic conditions the acid soluble suspended se concentrations were higher than those at the ph 6 strictly anoxic condition these findings indicated that conditions that favor the formation of se0 yield solids with the lowest acid soluble se concentrations 3 8 strategies for full scale deployment and integration of electrocoagulation into a treatment train iron electrocoagulation can continuously provide freshly formed fe ii containing solids i e green rust or fe oh 2 s at low dissolved oxygen concentrations iron electrocoagulation can rapidly treat dissolved se laden waters to achieve low dissolved se concentrations unlike chemical addition processes the fe ii dose can be controlled by varying the voltage applied to the electrodes which may offer advantages for use in decentralized treatment where its modular nature may be best suited to the volumes being treated holt et al 2005 by controlling the ph and do the process can be tuned to produce the most reactive phases for se removal another advantage is that it can introduce fe ii without also introducing a counter ion e g sulfate or chloride as would occur if fe ii containing reagents e g feso4 or fecl2 were used in this way the total dissolved solids of the system will not increase as much as in chemical coagulation even though iron electrocoagulation for selenium removal can be useful in many industries several factors need to be examined for full scale deployment first diverse industrial water compositions e g ca2 and so4 2 need to be taken into account for example wastewater from flue gas desulfurization contains high concentrations of sulfate buecker 2011 that may affect se removal sulfate can play a pivotal role in determining what iron containing solids form during electrocoagulation dubrawski et al 2015 and dissolved inorganic carbon can also affect what solids form we speculate that green rust formation was facilitated by the low dissolved inorganic carbon in the solution and controlling ph dubrawski et al 2015 found that green rust formed under conditions of 5 mm nacl ph 7 7 5 and do 5 they also observed that the absence of dissolved inorganic carbon provided favorable conditions for forming green rust instead of other iron compounds e g magnetite the electricity demand of the process needs to be considered in a 120 min experiment the total electric power used to treat a 500 ml batch was approximately 0 96 wh or 1 92 kwh m3 at the best condition studied the dissolved se decreased below detection limits within 60 min which would be 1 0 kwh m3 the electricity consumption of the overall iron electrocoagulation process could be higher than what is needed for conventional drinking water treatment about 0 04 0 16 kwh m3 epri 2009 howe et al 2012 but it is lower than values for reverse osmosis desalination of seawater 2 5 4 0 kwh m3 voutchkov 2018 power consumption of actual electrocoagulation treatment units can be optimized by modifications of the reactor geometry another issue for full scale deployment is the management of reduced se containing solids and dissolved fe after electrocoagulation se containing solids e g mainly se0 or fese s must be removed via physical separation from the reactor after removal of se containing solids the dissolved fe remaining in solution may need to be removed depending on the desired end uses of the water the portion of fe in the suspension that is dissolved is higher at conditions of low dissolved oxygen dissolved fe can be transformed into solid phases by ph adjustment and reaeration fig 2 shows that even partially oxic conditions can convert most of the iron into solid phases at ph 8 once transformed into solids iron containing suspended solids can be removed from the treated water se and fe containing solids remained after electrocoagulation will need to be removed from suspension by sedimentation e g plate setters howe et al 2012 or pressure driven membrane processes benjamin and lawler 2013 the choice of these removal process will be impacted by the properties of the solids sedimentation will require the suspended solids to have sufficiently high density and particle sizes and these properties may be affected by the water chemistry and electrocoagulation operating conditions if removal by sedimentation is not feasible then microfiltration or ultrafiltration can be used depending on the sizes of the se containing solids 4 conclusions our study investigated the impacts of dissolved oxygen and ph on dissolved selenate and selenite removal by iron electrocoagulation fig 9 we discovered that the rate and extent of dissolved se removal were highest under strictly anoxic conditions at ph 8 the solid characterization results showed that dissolved se primarily transformed to se0 and selenide the green rust and fe oh 2 s that formed in the suspension during electrocoagulation probably acted as reductants for the se vi and se iv overall we found that freshly formed reductive iron species achieved the most rapid and substantial dissolved
