3550,snow recharge is an important dominant hydrological process in the high altitude mountainous karstic aquifer systems in general widely used karst dedicated hydrological models e g karstmod varkarst do not include a snow routine in the model structure to avoid increasing the number of model parameters while representing the complex hydrological process as a result recharge process is not represented well which questions the optimality of the results that can be obtained under available datasets this study presents a novel pre processing method called sca routine to compensate for the missing snow routine in karst models the proposed pre processing method is driven by temperature precipitation and satellite based snow observation datasets the method classifies the precipitation input into three physical phases rain snow and mixed based on the temperature datasets to distribute each phase over the catchment using satellite driven snow covered area sca products by the proposed method the spring discharge simulations are regulated well in time and magnitude to examine the added utility of the sca routine the sca included simulations are compared to the model performances with no routine and the classical degree day method as a benchmark to test the efficiency of our proposed method we used a karst hydrological model karstmod to simulate the karst spring discharge in a well observed semi arid snow dominated karstic aquifer central taurus turkey our results confirmed that the karstmod model coupled by sca routine ensures better model performance with a value of nse 0 784 than those of the classical degree day method nse 0 760 and the model with no routine nse 0 306 thus providing a physically more realistic parameter set keywords modis degree day hydrological model snowmelt mountainous karst 1 introduction karst aquifers are valuable groundwater resources that provide fresh water to approximately 25 of the human population e g ford and williams 2007 chen et al 2017 among the karst regions the mountainous karst aquifers in the mediterranean region including pyrenees e g plagnes et al 2010 herms et al 2019 jódar et al 2020 dinaric karst bonacci 2012 ravbar and kovacic 2015 stevanović et al 2014 italian alps e g doveri et al 2021 drysdale et al 2001 menichini et al 2016 and anatolian taurids e g çelik and ünsal 1999 günay et al 2015 özyurt and bayari 2014 are predominately used for drinking water and agricultural activities since these mountainous karst aquifers receive a large proportion of the precipitation as snow fayad et al 2017 lópez moreno et al 2013 they are currently more vulnerable to the climate induced impacts than the relatively lower altitude karst aquifers particularly considering the increased temperature over the mediterranean regions alpert et al 2008 ribes et al 2019 in this context hydrological models play a critical role to simulate and predict the hydrological behavior of the mountainous karst aquifers while providing valuable information to better understand the hydrological system characteristics hydrological models are mainly divided into two groups i spatially distributed models and ii lumped models spatially distributed hydrological models discretize the aquifers into grids and explicitly calculate the variations in groundwater head while routing the flows from one grid to another using groundwater transfer laws these models often consider the water table data from observation wells such as in homogenous alluvial aquifers however the application of distributed models on the highly heterogeneous karst aquifers is only possible for the well explored karst aquifers e g birk et al 2005 doummar et al 2012 where data and parameter with the high spatial resolution are mostly available lumped hydrological models on the other hand are frequently calibrated and validated with time series of discharge i e data at high temporal but low spatial resolution e g fleury et al 2007 hartmann et al 2014 therefore due to the large number of parameters affecting complex hydrodynamic functioning with possible non linearity of the system fleury et al 2007 a primary challenge in karst modeling is to represent the dominant hydro geo logical processes in the model while simultaneously keeping the parameter space low dimensional to avoid over parameterization e g kirchner 2006 perrin et al 2001 seibert et al 2019 and model equifinality e g bárdossy 2007 beven 2006 in that sense due to the structural simplicity and relatively easier access of the input data than distributed models lumped models are widely used to simulate the hydrological dominant processes in the karst aquifers e g chang et al 2017 hartmann et al 2012a hartmann et al 2012b hartmann et al 2014 snowmelt is one of the dominant hydrological processes e g meeks and hunkeler 2015 jeelani et al 2017 jeannin et al 2021 in the mountainous karst catchments this process results in a great amount of water infiltrating into the karst aquifer as diffuse autogenic recharge mainly owing to the lack of soil and vegetation cover over the mountainous karstic catchments furthermore since the karstic mountain summits commonly exhibit dolines by which snow is mainly captured and accumulated inside the snowmelt water preferentially infiltrates through the karst aquifer rather than leading to lateral surface runoff therefore capturing the hydrological characteristics of the snow dominant hydrological system over the karstic catchments by the snowmelt runoff models e g hbv srm is not necessarily possible due to the model structural deficiency in this regard the incorporation of the subsurface heterogeneity of the karst aquifers characterized by the duality in flow and storage into hydrological models is of great importance to ensure the model parameter realism hartmann 2016b instead of tuning the model for the parameterization some of the well known karst hydrological models such as karstmod mazzilli et al 2019 and varkarst hartmann et al 2013a consider the snowmelt process with a priori uncertain parameter estimates in the pre processing of the precipitation data hartmann et al 2013b 2016 rather than in the model structure this makes it possible to avoid the increment in the number of model parameters and parameter interactions e g hornberger et al 1981 jakeman and hornberger 1993 box and jenkins 1976 wagener et al 2004 in addition structural modifications in hydrological models can be challenging due to the inaccessible model codes thus the delineation of the snowmelt process via pre processing of the precipitation data as model input is still a reasonable approach to overcome modeling drawbacks considering the pre processing methods the degree day snow routine is the simplest empirical form of the temperature index snowmelt methods hock 2003 which is widely used in karst hydrological modeling studies e g doummar et al 2018 bittner et al 2020 liu et al 2021 to obtain the melting water from an initial snowpack however as the degree day method does not consider the mixed phase of the precipitation which is an inevitable physical transition between rain and snow the input data results in rather inaccurate snow simulations hence a new approach better representing the physical phases of the precipitation while better distributing this forcing flux through the catchment area as a hydrological model input is essential using field or satellite based snow products for hydrological modeling studies are two options to obtain the snow as model input however the application of field based snow measurements e g snow depth snow density snow water equivalent is limited by the scarcity of existing stations and coarse spatial resolutions tekeli and tekeli 2012 in this regard the satellite derived products are an alternative to better characterize the areal distribution of snow which also explains their longevity in hydrological studies e g rango and martinec 1979 tekeli et al 2005 viviroli et al 2007 observations of many satellites e g advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr landsat sentinel and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis are used to obtain snow cover area information among them modis hall et al 2006 snow cover products obtained by observations of terra and aqua satellites are commonly used in the hydrological modeling studies owing to their high snow cover classification accuracy e g parajka and blöschl 2006 hall and riggs 2007 arslan and akyürek 2019 and daily temporal resolution tong et al 2020 however such snow observations are rarely utilized in karst hydrological models e g ruggieri et al 2021 for this reason the implementation of the satellite driven snow products into hydrological models have a potential to improve the accuracy of the simulation of snow accumulation snowmelt and thus karst aquifer recharge in this study we developed a new pre processing method to improve the ability of a certain hydrological model to represent snow processes in karst aquifers this method contains the rain snow mixed phase in addition to the phases of rain and snow where the snow cover area information is retrieved from satellite based products to test the efficiency of our proposed method we utilized a widely used karst hydrological model karstmod which originally does not include a snow routine by coupling the proposed snow routine with karstmod we simulated spring discharge in a semi arid and snow dominated mountainous karstic aquifer the added utility of the method is then evaluated via comparisons against the model with no snow routine and the classical degree day snow routine as a benchmark 2 the model for the simulation of the karst aquifer we used a karst hydrological model called karstmod https sokarst org en softwares karstmod en last access 5 december 2021 since the widely used original karstmod model hereafter called as karstmod base model does not have a snow routine three different versions of karstmod are considered to compensate for the absence of the snow process over the model simulation here the models coupled by the degree day and sca methods are referred to as karstmod dd and karstmod sca respectively 2 1 karstmod karstmod is a modeling platform developed mazzilli et al 2019 and successfully applied over the european karstic aquifers for both educational and operational purposes e g duran et al 2020 jourde et al 2015 massei et al 2015 baudement et al 2017 to simulate spring discharge karstmod utilizes two meteorological input variables daily total precipitation p and daily potential evapotranspiration et the model has a two level structure i epikarst routine e ii groundwater routine matrix m and conduit c components mazzilli et al 2019 in the model structure the epikarst routine represents both saturated and unsaturated zones in the soil and epikarst storages as the uppermost of the karstic aquifer units furthermore the lower reservoir component in the model is divided into two sub sections to represent the flow duality of the karstic system considering i low conductive matrix reservoir and ii high conductive conduit reservoir since the karstmod modeling platform provides a graphical user interface gui with structural flexibility to develop a site specific model we allocated our hydrological model considering the main hydrogeological characteristics of the study area by çallı 2017 and çelik and çallı 2021 fig 1 therefore our model structure is built based on the infinite characteristic time configuration ictc guinot et al 2015 the main advantage of ictc is to consider the dual flow behaviors of the system with the multiple transfer time scales in which sharp discharge peaks short memory are associated with slowly decreasing base discharge signal long memory mazzilli and bertin 2019 the karstmod model consists of three main reservoirs including the epikarst e matrix m and conduit c components which are all configured by ictc therefore a total number of 11 model parameters was defined table 1 as for the model internal fluxes between the model compartments in karstmod they are divided into two groups i baseflow and ii quick flow the water level in each reservoir is the weighted sum of the internal water level in each sub reservoir and similarly the outflow rates from each reservoir are the weighted sum of the outflow rates from each sub reservoir while the baseflow is active in any time scale the quick flow is only activated when the internal water level in any of the sub reservoirs reaches a certain threshold value fig 1 2 2 karstmod dd to consider the lack of a snow related process in the karstmod base model the degree day correction martinec 1960 is implemented using the eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 1 snow i snow i 1 p i t i t m m a x snow i 1 melt i 0 t i t m 2 lw i 0 t i t m p i min snow i 1 melt i t i t m 3 melt i 0 t i t m d d f t i t m t i t m where ddf mm c 1day 1 is the degree day factor snowi mmd 1 is the state variable of snow storage liquid water lwi mmd 1 and snowmelt water melti mmd 1 are the fluxes in the day i pi mmd 1 and ti c account for the precipitation and air temperature for the day i respectively and tm c is the threshold temperature at which snowmelt begins 2 3 karstmod sca for the improvement of the karstmod base model performance without increasing the model structural complexity we proposed the sca routine method which pre processes the precipitation dataset as a model forcing input considering snow accumulation and snowmelt this routine is similar to the degree day routine such that both methods use temperature datasets to split the precipitation into different phases to a certain extent while the classical degree day routine collins 1934 martinec 1960 kustas et al 1994 considers two phases rain and snow the sca method takes into account three phases of the precipitation including rain mixed and snow furthermore by the proposed method each phase of the precipitation is spatially distributed to the catchment area using fractional sca data in the sca method three temperature thresholds are expressed by the 1 threshold temperature above which the precipitation occurs as rainfall tr c 2 threshold temperature below which the precipitation occurs as snow ts c and 3 threshold temperature at which snowmelt begins tm c apart from these three temperature thresholds the sca routine also needs degree day factor ddf mm c 1day 1 and snow cover area time series fig 1c in the routine snowi lwi and melti are calculated using eq 4 eq 5 and eq 6 in the days in which t s ti tr 4 snow i p i sca i max snow i 1 melt i 0 t s t i t r 5 lw i p i 1 sca i min melt i snow i 1 t s t i t r 6 melt i d d f t i t m t s t i t r where pi mmd 1 ti c and scai express precipitation air temperature and snow covered area corresponding to the day i in the time series respectively 2 4 parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis for the estimation of model parameters we carried out the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue approach beven and binley 1992 provided in the karstmod modeling platform the model parameter set was randomly sampled based on the uniform distribution assumption while the feasible parameter space was determined from the previous experiences çallı 2017 çallı and çelik 2018 çelik and çallı 2021 table 2 threshold values for each snow parameter including ddf ts tm tr were defined based on the prior knowledge about the study site çallı 2017 çelik et al 2018 çelik and çallı 2021 relevant literature e g martinec 1960 martinec and rango 1986 as well as the study site under similar hydro climatic conditions doummar et al 2018 by trial and error method we set to the constant values for ddf ts tm tr as 0 7 mm c 1day 1 2 c 0 c and 2 c respectively see appendix 5 we performed a combination of parameter tests including the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to examine the behaviors of the obtained parameter sets from each model in response to the implementation of the snow routines sobol sensitivity analysis sobol 1993 provided in karstmod is used to identify the most influential model parameter s and their contribution s to the model output variance e g borgonovo and plischke 2016 thereby revealing the most uncertain model parameters in our study we accepted si larger than 0 1 as the highly sensitive parameter while the value range between 0 01 and 0 1 refers to the less sensitive e g tang et al 2007 zhan et al 2013 to assess the reduction in the parameter uncertainty we considered the confinement in the behavioral parameter location using the percentile approach 25th and 75th percentiles similarly to reveal the model prediction uncertainty we comparatively evaluated the confinement in the 95 uncertainty bound of karstmod base to those coupled by the dd and sca routines 2 5 model performance evaluation the model performance analysis was performed against the observed daily spring discharge to assess the model skill we used nash sutcliff efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 as a performance metric in eq 7 7 nse 1 t 1 t q t sim q t obs 2 t 1 t q t obs q obs 2 where q t sim and q t obs are the simulated and observed discharges respectively while q obs represents the mean value of the observed discharge the three versions of the karsmod model karstmod base karstmod dd and karstmod sca were run 5 105 times to obtain the behavioral simulations we then selected the top 100 behavioral parameter sets from each model run for further parameter analysis for the model calibration scheme we applied the split sampling test procedure klemeš 1986 the 2 years model calibration covering the period of 01 10 2015 30 09 2017 was allocated for karstmod dd and karstmod sca whereas the period of 01 10 2017 13 07 2019 was used for the model validation the first 304 days of the year 2015 were kept for the spin up period for all three models however the calibration of karstmod base performed for the two years 01 10 2015 30 09 2017 does not satisfactorily capture the karst spring flow characteristics particularly under the peak flow conditions over the winter period during which the model completely misses the peak values of discharge for this reason for the karstmod base model conditioning we performed an extra one year model calibration 01 10 2015 and 30 09 2016 by following the methodology proposed by mcintyre and wheater 2004 doing that we kept the karstmod base model validation and warm up periods as identical as defined for karstmod dd and karstmod sca 3 case study 3 1 study area we tested the efficiency of our proposed sca routine in a snow dominated eastern mediterranean karstic aquifer located in the semi arid climate region in central taurus southern turkey the study area is one of the sub systems of the central taurus karst massive çelik and çallı 2021 discharging through the suğla polje fig 2 the elevation of the study area ranges from 1076 m the suğla polje to 2900 m above sea level the gidengelmez mountains according to the long term historical meteorological data record the average annual precipitation is approximately 780 mmy 1 and the mean annual air temperature is around 11 c mgm 2020 as one of the snow dominated karstic systems in the central taurus karst massive the snowpack plays a critical role in aquifer recharge in our site which is accounted for by virtually one third of the total groundwater recharge sourcing from the snowmelt çelik and çallı 2021 the study area mainly consists of the jurassic limestone units upper cretaceous ophiolites and a limited number of volcanic units e g blumenthal 1947a 1947b özgül 1976 fig 2c the carbonates are named after özgül 1997 as geyikdağı unit covered by the karstified jurassic limestone and dolomites as well as partly upper cretaceous pelagic limestones the limestones are highly permeable due to the intensive karstification in the carbonate units while the ophiolites are mainly impermeable fig 2c for that reason the carbonate covered site hosts numerous karstic features including caves sinkholes seasonal springs swallow holes and dissolution dolines fig 2c the dolines are placed in the high altitude zone of the gidengelmez mountains fig 2c which is covered by snow during at least half of a hydrological year the main recharge zone of the karst aquifer was delineated as approximately 60 km2 çelik 2017 çelik et al 2018 çallı 2021 yet a widespread of the limestone outcrop towards the summit of gidengelmez mountains potentially contributes to the aquifer recharge fig 2c the karstic aquifer system is actively discharged by several seasonal karstic springs in the study area all joining into the şehirçay channel flowing through to the suğla lake fig 2b while these karstic springs are mainly served for the province of seydişehir approx 100 000 population pınarbaşı spring is the only one monitored from december 2014 until now pınarbaşı spring is located on the southern side of seydişehir fig 2b and is supplied as the main drinking water resource the spring dries in the summer periods during which the active reservoir is mostly emptied with an approximate annual cumulative discharge of 18 million m3 the peak discharge of pınarbaşı spring is around 7 08 m3s 1 while the average spring discharge is represented by an approximate value of 0 49 m3s 1 3 2 datasets to simulate the karst spring discharge we used the observations of pınarbaşı daily discharge the daily meteorological data including total precipitation p the total of rain and snow and maximum tmax minimum tmin and mean 2 m air temperatures tmean were obtained from the turkish state meteorological service mgm 2020 for 3 meteorological stations located nearby the study area fig 2 while the daily net radiation li et al 2019 2020 and relative humidity airs project 2019 data were downloaded from the ges disc dataset platform table 2 we interpolated the p and tmean of the three meteorological stations fig 1a using the inverse distance weighting idw method eq 8 to obtain spatially representative model input forcing datasets 8 p int i 1 n p i d i p i 1 n 1 d i p where pint is the interpolated meteorological data p mm or t c pi is the corresponding observed data at station i di is the distance between station i and the location in which interpolation is made for for the calculation of the daily potential evapotranspiration et we used the penman monteith formula in eq 9 9 et δ r n g ρ a c p e s e a r a δ γ 1 r s r a where rn mjm 2d 1 is the net radiation g mjm 2day 1 is the soil heat flux es ea kpa represents the vapor pressure deficit of the air ra sm 1 is the mean air density at constant pressure and cp mjkg 2 c 1 is the specific heat of the air d kpa c 1 represents the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship g kpa c 1 is the psychrometric constant and rs sm 1 and ra sm 1 are the bulk surface and aerodynamic resistances 3 3 processing of snow covered area to estimate snow covered area sca we used modis daily snow cover products mod10a1 version 6 and modis 8 days maximum snow extent products mod10a2 which were retrieved using observations collected by terra satellite ndsi datasets were obtained for h20v05 tile downloaded as hierarchical data format hdf fig 2c and processed by the modis time series pre processing modistsp v 2 0 4 package busetto and ranghetti 2016 developed in the r environment since mod10a1 are generally disturbed by the cloud cover the cloud removal methodology was applied using mod10a2 8 days maximum snow extent data following the methodology proposed by gafurov and bárdossy 2009 the modis products collect the snow cover data as normalized difference snow index ndsi format obtained by eq 10 10 ndsi modis b a n d 4 modis b a n d 6 modis b a n d 4 modis b a n d 6 to estimate the fractional snow covered area the obtained values from the ndsi were transformed into the binary data format see appendix 1 thus calculating the snow covered area in the day i sca i as followed by the eq 11 11 sca i number o f s n o w c e l l s total n u m b e r o f c e l l s 4 results 4 1 estimation of snow and liquid water the timing and magnitude of the karst aquifer recharge are mainly controlled by the snow and lw estimations of the snow routines fig 3 demonstrates the total snow storage simulated by the karstmod dd and karstmod sca models here the snow storage obtained from each model is inter compared for further understanding of model performances in turn examining parameter sensitivity and uncertainty on the simulation of the model internal states overall the main difference between karstmod dd and karstmod sca is the availability of the mixed phase of the precipitation in the snow simulations of karstmod sca considering the color scheme in fig 3 the blue segments represent the period in which the air temperature is below ts snow accumulates while the red segments account for the period in which the air temperature is above tr snowmelt however the yellow segments represent the period where the air temperature is between ts and tr mixed precipitation snow accumulation could occur over the blue and yellow parts of the graph but not in red whereas snowmelt could be tracked by the yellow and red parts of the line but not in blue in this regard increasing snow state in the red segments of the graph or decreasing snow state in the blue segments refer to the lack of representativeness of the snow routine karstmod dd only accumulates snow until the 2nd week of february particularly in the year 2017 while karstmod sca both accumulates and melts snow over the same period fig 3 hence the inconsistency between the color scheme and snow accumulation snowmelt mechanism is frequent in karstmod dd in 2016 2018 and 2019 whereas it could be only observed for a few days in mid january 2019 in karstmod sca fig 3 the simulated time series of lw by the karstmod dd and karstmod sca models are provided in fig 4 the main disagreement between the simulations can be seen throughout february april each year here while karstmod dd accumulates the precipitation as a form of snow in the mid late days of january 2019 karstmod sca releases more lw during those days this particular finding can be explained by the process consideration of the dd snow routine which essentially melts the snow in the storage in february 2019 during which relatively lower lw is obtained by the sca routine the same finding is also the case in mid march 2019 when the sca snow routine melts the snow in the storage as opposed to water release as lw by the karstmod dd model 4 2 model performance results three different versions of karstmod including karstmod base karstmod dd and karstmod sca are run for the simulation of pınarbaşı spring discharge over the years 2016 and 2017 the model performance results are provided in table 3 fig 5 demonstrates the best realizations which provide the highest nse values from the calibration of each model here the realizations are also accompanied by the 95 uncertainty bounds of the behavioral simulations overall karstmod base entirely misses the peak discharges fig 5a thus providing a poor model performance with a rather low nse metric nse 0 306 in calibration and nse 0 039 in the validation periods when the model was performed over the 2 year calibration period the years of 2016 and 2017 over which the model mainly captures no discharge values in the drier sub periods however when the calibration period for karstmod base was restricted to one hydrological year appendix 4 the model skill was directly improved nse 0 660 thereby leading to a good agreement with the observed spring discharge however the restriction of the calibration time leads to an increase in the uncertainty bound in the karstmod base model see appendix 4 overall coupling both snow routines with karstmod base allows the better simulation of spring discharge particularly resembling the peak discharges over the model calibration periods fig 5b 5c to a certain extent karstmod sca better captures the time and magnitude of the mid and high flows than that of karstmod dd fig 5 allowing to obtaining better nse statistics for both training 0 784 sca and 0 760 dd and validation 0 448 sca and 0 369 dd periods even though the optimal parameter set of karstmod dd results in a better agreement with the spring low flows the uncertainty bound in those periods is wider than karstmod sca fig 5d accordingly the addition of the snow routines in the karstmod base model either dd or sca substantially improves the model performance both in calibration and validation periods for the comparative evaluation of the model performance over the model calibration validation periods in each model the scatterplots of the observed and simulated discharges are provided in fig 6 here the simulated discharge values for high flows for the karstmod base model are more scattered around the 1 1 line than other versions where the independent validation results are even more dispersed than the training datasets for all versions fig 6 hence karstmod base indicates more biased for the validation period thereby underestimating the high flow characteristics during the model calibration 4 3 parameter sensitivity and uncertainty the sensitivity test result is provided in fig 7 overall hmaxe primarily impacts the model output variations as the most sensitive model parameter followed by αe and hmine while hmaxc is the least sensitive one si less than 0 001 here the parameter hmaxe is represented by the values of si 0 467 karstmod base 0 171 karstmod dd and 0 159 karstmod sca whereas αe and hmine are accounted for less than 0 1 for all three models regarding the model parameters characterizing the time of water transfer in the model reservoirs c e and m they do not profoundly influence the model output variations thus indicating the non influential model parameters with rather lower values of si ranging from 0 002 to 0 01 specifically the test results demonstrate that the models coupled with both snow routines do not necessarily affect the sensitivity of these three parameters tc te and tm the variation in the range of the behavioral parameter sets is provided in fig 8 overall the distribution of the model parameters hmaxc hmaxe and hmine obtained by the karstmod dd and karstmod sca versions are significantly different from those obtained by the karstmod base model thus ensuring the narrower interquartile range iqr here hmaxc demonstrates the substantial reduction by the karstmod base model coupled with both snow routines while the median and optimal values are nearly the same similarly the optimum values of hmaxe are represented by 42 mm and 57 mm and hmine are 10 8 mm and 16 5 mm in the karstmod dd and karstmod sca models respectively conversely it cannot be said that there is any further confinement in the model parameters regarding the recession a and time t here the iqr of a and t parameters do not demonstrate any reasonable reduction when both snow routines are implemented as the model preprocessing route fig 8 however as an important finding the optimum and median values of these parameters nearly overlap each other in karstmod sca while providing nearly the same parameter values with more certain values considering the reduction in iqr for instance the median value of epikarst parameter te day accounts for approximately 11 5 days while the optimum value is nearly 11 days by karstmod sca table 2 although a rather weak reduction in the parameter range is still justified by the karstmod sca model the probability density distributions pdfs of the 100 behavioral parameter sets of each model run are presented in appendix 2 the identical distributions can also be tracked over the most sensitive model parameters hmaxe and hmine here karstmod sca does ensure the more identifiable parameters demonstrating a central tendency thereby fulfilling the parameter uni modality in both parameter s density regions 4 4 model internal states to reveal to what extent the model parameters obtained by karstmod dd and karstmod sca vary the model internal states over the model structure we examine the water levels in the corresponding model compartments e m and c in fig 9 overall the karstmod base model simulates significantly high storage in the epikarst reservoir than the karstmod dd and karstmod sca models furthermore the karstmod sca model generates higher water storage in compartment e than that of the karstmod dd model thus resulting in lower water levels in c and m components karstmod dd tolerates the delay of recharge caused by the high values of snow while storing less water in compartment e especially during the snowmelt periods additionally karstmod sca leads to a relatively less amount of snow than karstmod dd here it is also visible that the best parameter set of each model defines a rather different model internal states particularly in compartment e similarly the water levels in compartment m substantially differ from each other as time continues 5 discussion 5 1 increment in the hydrological model skill a substantial increase in the performance of karstmod base was observed after reducing the calibration period from two years to one year appendix 4 this improvement can be explained by the modeler s intention to increase the model representativeness e g mcintyre and wheater 2004 seibert and beven 2009 only considering a particular period for our case one hydrological year in which the simulated discharges are successfully captured by the model however the reduction in the calibration period e g frank et al 2021 was criticized as a proper calibration approach to improve the model performance as it mostly reduces the model realism juston et al 2009 the approach therefore does not mean that the shorter period s could only be selected to improve the model realism while providing more representative model simulations with much confidence here the model realism with a degree of confidence should be associated with capturing the hydrological process that dominates the system of interest wagener et al 2003 which is not essentially simulated by the karstmod base model in this regard a fair improvement in the model performance is achieved by karstmod dd fig 5b however karstmod sca is more successful than karstmod dd in capturing the high and low flow characteristics of the spring discharge thus allowing to a fair reduction in the prediction uncertainty particularly over the snowmelt periods fig 5c 5d here the improvement in the model performance with the sca routine could be explained by the proper representation of the snow accumulation and snowmelt process based on the introduction of the mixed phase of the precipitation and the satellite based sca data from our findings defining the mixed phase of precipitation in the sca routine provides an advantage to improve karstmod sca skill as opposed to karstmod dd thus allowing to capturing the timing and magnitude of the low and high flows however the underestimation of the peak discharges by both karstmod dd and karstmod sca could be mainly attributed to the intermittent characteristics of the spring discharge to a certain extent as the simulation of the intermittent ephemeral discharge could result in a calibration problem particularly obtaining the consistent model parameters the artificial increment in the model skill could be seen while providing a perfect fit s over the drier periods however the process based information derived from these sub period s is still under the discussion seibert and beven 2009 because the model does not necessarily reflect the dominant hydrological characteristics e g seibert 2003 gharari et al 2013 for this reason even though the calibration approach ignoring specific periods either drier or wetter may increase the model skill the representation of the system hydrological functioning by the model could be rather inaccurate 5 2 assessment of the model parameter realism the sensitivity tests revealed that the most sensitive model parameters belong to the epikarst zone represented by hmaxe αe and hmine fig 7 all of which primarily affect the recharge process in the karstic aquifers especially in the well developed karst hydrological systems considering the sensitivity test results the si value of the most sensitive model parameter hmaxe 0 467 for the karstmod base model is decreased in karstmod dd 0 171 and karstmod sca 0 159 this means that the fractionation of the mixed phase of precipitation through the karstic catchment considering the satellite driven data fairly reduces the sensitivity of hmaxe fig 7 thus providing a more accurate value than that of the karstmod base model fig 8 this particular finding could be associated with the well representation of the karst aquifer recharge by the sca routine here the recharge as a mechanism is characteristically observed in the well developed karst system in which the water circulation is directly controlled by the epikarst zone mainly due to the lack of or very thin soil zone see fig 2c indeed this is especially true for the karstic aquifers developed in the high altitude regions where the epikarst zone acts as a water transmitter rather than a reservoir williams 1983 2008 therefore the epikarst zone distributes the recharge in time and space while defining the temporal delay of the aquifer recharge williams 1983 palmer 2006 bauer et al 2005 in this context considering the karstic characteristics of our study site since the average soil and epikarst thickness together could not exceed a few meters in our site the values for hmaxe 57 2 mm and hmine 16 5 mm in karstmod sca are more plausible as compared to those 572 2 and 62 9 mm respectively obtained by the karstmod base model the low values for both parameters could indicate the fact that there is less delay in the epikarst storage this finding is also confirmed by the physical characteristics of our karstic area since the lack of soil and vegetation cover do permit rather quick water infiltration through the groundwater reservoir without any delay regarding the physical meanings of model parameters hmine and hmaxe the lower values of hmine imply less water stored in the epikarst reservoir mazzilli et al 2019 whereas the lower hmaxe indicates the higher hydraulic conductivity of the epikarst reservoir which enables a rapid water transfer from the epikarst zone perrin et al 2003 to the groundwater reservoir therefore it is fair to infer that with the sca routine we could indirectly identify the appropriate time for water infiltration from the epikarst zone as opposed to the rather unrealistically obtained values by the karstmod base model considering the median values and the optimum parameter values of the epikarst parameters hmaxe hmine te and αe they are getting closer when karstmod sca was performed fig 8 in parallel with this the peak values of probability distributions for the sensitive parameters hmaxe αe and hmine are more consistent with the optimal parameter values appendix 2 this can be explained by the fact that the sca routine slightly better identifies the epikarst parameters than that of the dd snow routine from this point of view defining a mixed phase for the snowmelt process allows us to properly delineate the precipitation as a model input flux to obtain more robust simulations with better parameter confinement fig 8 furthermore owing to the mixed phase in the sca routine karstmod sca produces more continuous recharge than karstmod dd which indicates that the model compartments of karstmod sca are not artificially forced to withhold the incoming water to satisfy the water delay this clearly explains what is not considered by the karstmod base model structure resulting in rather higher values for hmaxc and hmaxm to keep the water storage high while simultaneously satisfying a longer delay as for the model parameters ax and tx since they were obtained by the recession and time series analysis çelik and çallı 2021 we did not define a wide parameter range for the model conditioning phase table 1 this therefore could be the reason why the further confinement was not obtained by karstmod sca and karstmod dd fig 8 conversely as the parameters controlling the water levels hmaxe hmine hmaxc and hmaxm are not easily measurable the rather wider parameter ranges for these parameters table 1 may explain the better confinement by both models consequently they provide better parameter identification with more distinct and condensed distribution spaces fig 8 especially for the most sensitive model parameters including hmaxe and hmine appendix 2 about the physical meaning of the recession constant α high values mostly imply the intensive karstification process over the karstic system malík and vojtková 2012 which in turn primarily causes rapid water transfer through the high conductive epikarst and conduit compartments as an ultimate fact a rapid water transfer in the system is characterized by a rather shorter transfer time t considering this the higher values of αc and lower values tc by karstmod dd and karstmod sca verify the rapid water transfer from the conduit compartment to the spring discharge while low hmaxc implies less water stored in the conduit reservoir due to the high conductivity here the obtained values of tc 2 73 days and te 10 9 days by the karstmod sca model are more consistent with the findings by çallı and çelik 2018 and çelik and çallı 2021 where the transit time of the conduit and fracture reservoirs were obtained 3 days tc and 13 days te respectively therefore the optimum values of these parameters by karstmod sca are reasonable while capturing the conduit dominated discharge characteristics of the test site concerning the recharge area ra it was estimated as 70 6 km2 by karstmod sca while indicating the recharge area for all karst springs including pınarbaşı spring the estimated value for ra was also supported by the water budget calculations provided in appendix 3 5 3 assessment of the model internal states model internal states are important signatures to reveal how accurate the model simulates the spring discharge even though the observations for the different model compartments including e m and c do not exist for our study even for most hydrological studies the simulated total storages by the different hydrological models over each compartment are inter compared for the improved understanding of the model performance in our study fig 9 as the main finding karstmod base did not produce the conduit storage for a long time during the calibration fig 9 due to the high storage in compartment e this finding however contradicts with the obtained values of recession coefficients in previous research by çallı and çelik 2018 and çelik and çallı 2021 both of which inform that the karst spring demonstrates the conduit dominated flow characteristics yet the model simulations by karstmod dd and karstmod sca are more consistent with the main outcomes of the previous studies e g çallı and çelik 2018 çelik and çallı 2021 one significant difference between karstmod dd and karstmod sca is that the water level in compartment c falls to zero in karstmod sca during the dry periods since pınarbaşı spring dries in the summer periods it is more accurate to simulate the water level in the conduit reservoir as zero mainly because of the conduit dominated discharge characteristics of the karst spring it is important to note that karstmod dd is forced to compensate for the underestimation of the epikarst storage while overestimating the storages in the matrix and conduit reservoirs fig 9 this can be attributed to the rough transition between the rain and snow phases of the precipitation input to a lesser extent karstmod dd only considers snow and does not produce lw in some days when ti tm during which karstmod sca simulates lw for the non snowy parts of the catchment this therefore results in more continuous recharge another important outcome from the lw estimations is that during the relatively warmer winters e g 2016 and 2018 there is not a significant difference between karstmod dd and karstmod sca however during the snow dominated hydrological years e g 2017 and 2019 the difference is much more visible fig 4 this would come from the measurement sensitivity of the modis sensors as it could not consider the snow until it reaches a certain density for that reason this uncertainty in the measurement over the modis sensors could be cross checked by either using the sca products from the different satellites or using ground based observations 6 conclusions this paper presents a newly proposed snow routine to increase the model representativeness of a karst hydrological model over the snow dominated mountainous karst aquifers the sca routine considers three phases of the precipitation rain snow and mixed phase and distributes each phase to the catchment via satellite driven sca data by the sca routine we increased the hydrological model performance while simultaneously obtaining physically meaningful parameter sets the key findings from our research are as followed the sca routine better processes the snow accumulation and snowmelt than the degree day method by dividing the precipitation into three phases and distributing them through the catchment using the satellite driven sca data although the substantial increase in karstmod sca performance over the karstmod dd is not observed the sca routine still ensures the physically meaningful parameter sets thereby providing less uncertain and more identifiable parameters yet the main difference between the models can be followed by the simulation of the model internal states 7 considerations and limitations the proposed method could be coupled with different hydrological models either lumped or distributed models the snow covered area products obtained from different satellites can also be used in the sca routine for the application of the sca routine we would recommend to divide the area of interest where the spatial coverage and topographic variability is high into the sub catchments considering the elevation zones and thus obtaining the tr ts tm and ddf parameters for each sub catchment based on the hydro climatological characteristics we do not claim that the sca routine is a perfect snow routine which always guarantee a better performance over the degree day method for instance selection of different performance metric s see appendix 5 and or increasing the ensemble of model runs e g tens of millions may depict an opposite performance result at this point the contribution of the sca routine to the model skill should be tracked by the parameter realism and physically meaningful model internal states funding tübi̇tak

3550,snow recharge is an important dominant hydrological process in the high altitude mountainous karstic aquifer systems in general widely used karst dedicated hydrological models e g karstmod varkarst do not include a snow routine in the model structure to avoid increasing the number of model parameters while representing the complex hydrological process as a result recharge process is not represented well which questions the optimality of the results that can be obtained under available datasets this study presents a novel pre processing method called sca routine to compensate for the missing snow routine in karst models the proposed pre processing method is driven by temperature precipitation and satellite based snow observation datasets the method classifies the precipitation input into three physical phases rain snow and mixed based on the temperature datasets to distribute each phase over the catchment using satellite driven snow covered area sca products by the proposed method the spring discharge simulations are regulated well in time and magnitude to examine the added utility of the sca routine the sca included simulations are compared to the model performances with no routine and the classical degree day method as a benchmark to test the efficiency of our proposed method we used a karst hydrological model karstmod to simulate the karst spring discharge in a well observed semi arid snow dominated karstic aquifer central taurus turkey our results confirmed that the karstmod model coupled by sca routine ensures better model performance with a value of nse 0 784 than those of the classical degree day method nse 0 760 and the model with no routine nse 0 306 thus providing a physically more realistic parameter set keywords modis degree day hydrological model snowmelt mountainous karst 1 introduction karst aquifers are valuable groundwater resources that provide fresh water to approximately 25 of the human population e g ford and williams 2007 chen et al 2017 among the karst regions the mountainous karst aquifers in the mediterranean region including pyrenees e g plagnes et al 2010 herms et al 2019 jódar et al 2020 dinaric karst bonacci 2012 ravbar and kovacic 2015 stevanović et al 2014 italian alps e g doveri et al 2021 drysdale et al 2001 menichini et al 2016 and anatolian taurids e g çelik and ünsal 1999 günay et al 2015 özyurt and bayari 2014 are predominately used for drinking water and agricultural activities since these mountainous karst aquifers receive a large proportion of the precipitation as snow fayad et al 2017 lópez moreno et al 2013 they are currently more vulnerable to the climate induced impacts than the relatively lower altitude karst aquifers particularly considering the increased temperature over the mediterranean regions alpert et al 2008 ribes et al 2019 in this context hydrological models play a critical role to simulate and predict the hydrological behavior of the mountainous karst aquifers while providing valuable information to better understand the hydrological system characteristics hydrological models are mainly divided into two groups i spatially distributed models and ii lumped models spatially distributed hydrological models discretize the aquifers into grids and explicitly calculate the variations in groundwater head while routing the flows from one grid to another using groundwater transfer laws these models often consider the water table data from observation wells such as in homogenous alluvial aquifers however the application of distributed models on the highly heterogeneous karst aquifers is only possible for the well explored karst aquifers e g birk et al 2005 doummar et al 2012 where data and parameter with the high spatial resolution are mostly available lumped hydrological models on the other hand are frequently calibrated and validated with time series of discharge i e data at high temporal but low spatial resolution e g fleury et al 2007 hartmann et al 2014 therefore due to the large number of parameters affecting complex hydrodynamic functioning with possible non linearity of the system fleury et al 2007 a primary challenge in karst modeling is to represent the dominant hydro geo logical processes in the model while simultaneously keeping the parameter space low dimensional to avoid over parameterization e g kirchner 2006 perrin et al 2001 seibert et al 2019 and model equifinality e g bárdossy 2007 beven 2006 in that sense due to the structural simplicity and relatively easier access of the input data than distributed models lumped models are widely used to simulate the hydrological dominant processes in the karst aquifers e g chang et al 2017 hartmann et al 2012a hartmann et al 2012b hartmann et al 2014 snowmelt is one of the dominant hydrological processes e g meeks and hunkeler 2015 jeelani et al 2017 jeannin et al 2021 in the mountainous karst catchments this process results in a great amount of water infiltrating into the karst aquifer as diffuse autogenic recharge mainly owing to the lack of soil and vegetation cover over the mountainous karstic catchments furthermore since the karstic mountain summits commonly exhibit dolines by which snow is mainly captured and accumulated inside the snowmelt water preferentially infiltrates through the karst aquifer rather than leading to lateral surface runoff therefore capturing the hydrological characteristics of the snow dominant hydrological system over the karstic catchments by the snowmelt runoff models e g hbv srm is not necessarily possible due to the model structural deficiency in this regard the incorporation of the subsurface heterogeneity of the karst aquifers characterized by the duality in flow and storage into hydrological models is of great importance to ensure the model parameter realism hartmann 2016b instead of tuning the model for the parameterization some of the well known karst hydrological models such as karstmod mazzilli et al 2019 and varkarst hartmann et al 2013a consider the snowmelt process with a priori uncertain parameter estimates in the pre processing of the precipitation data hartmann et al 2013b 2016 rather than in the model structure this makes it possible to avoid the increment in the number of model parameters and parameter interactions e g hornberger et al 1981 jakeman and hornberger 1993 box and jenkins 1976 wagener et al 2004 in addition structural modifications in hydrological models can be challenging due to the inaccessible model codes thus the delineation of the snowmelt process via pre processing of the precipitation data as model input is still a reasonable approach to overcome modeling drawbacks considering the pre processing methods the degree day snow routine is the simplest empirical form of the temperature index snowmelt methods hock 2003 which is widely used in karst hydrological modeling studies e g doummar et al 2018 bittner et al 2020 liu et al 2021 to obtain the melting water from an initial snowpack however as the degree day method does not consider the mixed phase of the precipitation which is an inevitable physical transition between rain and snow the input data results in rather inaccurate snow simulations hence a new approach better representing the physical phases of the precipitation while better distributing this forcing flux through the catchment area as a hydrological model input is essential using field or satellite based snow products for hydrological modeling studies are two options to obtain the snow as model input however the application of field based snow measurements e g snow depth snow density snow water equivalent is limited by the scarcity of existing stations and coarse spatial resolutions tekeli and tekeli 2012 in this regard the satellite derived products are an alternative to better characterize the areal distribution of snow which also explains their longevity in hydrological studies e g rango and martinec 1979 tekeli et al 2005 viviroli et al 2007 observations of many satellites e g advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr landsat sentinel and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis are used to obtain snow cover area information among them modis hall et al 2006 snow cover products obtained by observations of terra and aqua satellites are commonly used in the hydrological modeling studies owing to their high snow cover classification accuracy e g parajka and blöschl 2006 hall and riggs 2007 arslan and akyürek 2019 and daily temporal resolution tong et al 2020 however such snow observations are rarely utilized in karst hydrological models e g ruggieri et al 2021 for this reason the implementation of the satellite driven snow products into hydrological models have a potential to improve the accuracy of the simulation of snow accumulation snowmelt and thus karst aquifer recharge in this study we developed a new pre processing method to improve the ability of a certain hydrological model to represent snow processes in karst aquifers this method contains the rain snow mixed phase in addition to the phases of rain and snow where the snow cover area information is retrieved from satellite based products to test the efficiency of our proposed method we utilized a widely used karst hydrological model karstmod which originally does not include a snow routine by coupling the proposed snow routine with karstmod we simulated spring discharge in a semi arid and snow dominated mountainous karstic aquifer the added utility of the method is then evaluated via comparisons against the model with no snow routine and the classical degree day snow routine as a benchmark 2 the model for the simulation of the karst aquifer we used a karst hydrological model called karstmod https sokarst org en softwares karstmod en last access 5 december 2021 since the widely used original karstmod model hereafter called as karstmod base model does not have a snow routine three different versions of karstmod are considered to compensate for the absence of the snow process over the model simulation here the models coupled by the degree day and sca methods are referred to as karstmod dd and karstmod sca respectively 2 1 karstmod karstmod is a modeling platform developed mazzilli et al 2019 and successfully applied over the european karstic aquifers for both educational and operational purposes e g duran et al 2020 jourde et al 2015 massei et al 2015 baudement et al 2017 to simulate spring discharge karstmod utilizes two meteorological input variables daily total precipitation p and daily potential evapotranspiration et the model has a two level structure i epikarst routine e ii groundwater routine matrix m and conduit c components mazzilli et al 2019 in the model structure the epikarst routine represents both saturated and unsaturated zones in the soil and epikarst storages as the uppermost of the karstic aquifer units furthermore the lower reservoir component in the model is divided into two sub sections to represent the flow duality of the karstic system considering i low conductive matrix reservoir and ii high conductive conduit reservoir since the karstmod modeling platform provides a graphical user interface gui with structural flexibility to develop a site specific model we allocated our hydrological model considering the main hydrogeological characteristics of the study area by çallı 2017 and çelik and çallı 2021 fig 1 therefore our model structure is built based on the infinite characteristic time configuration ictc guinot et al 2015 the main advantage of ictc is to consider the dual flow behaviors of the system with the multiple transfer time scales in which sharp discharge peaks short memory are associated with slowly decreasing base discharge signal long memory mazzilli and bertin 2019 the karstmod model consists of three main reservoirs including the epikarst e matrix m and conduit c components which are all configured by ictc therefore a total number of 11 model parameters was defined table 1 as for the model internal fluxes between the model compartments in karstmod they are divided into two groups i baseflow and ii quick flow the water level in each reservoir is the weighted sum of the internal water level in each sub reservoir and similarly the outflow rates from each reservoir are the weighted sum of the outflow rates from each sub reservoir while the baseflow is active in any time scale the quick flow is only activated when the internal water level in any of the sub reservoirs reaches a certain threshold value fig 1 2 2 karstmod dd to consider the lack of a snow related process in the karstmod base model the degree day correction martinec 1960 is implemented using the eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 1 snow i snow i 1 p i t i t m m a x snow i 1 melt i 0 t i t m 2 lw i 0 t i t m p i min snow i 1 melt i t i t m 3 melt i 0 t i t m d d f t i t m t i t m where ddf mm c 1day 1 is the degree day factor snowi mmd 1 is the state variable of snow storage liquid water lwi mmd 1 and snowmelt water melti mmd 1 are the fluxes in the day i pi mmd 1 and ti c account for the precipitation and air temperature for the day i respectively and tm c is the threshold temperature at which snowmelt begins 2 3 karstmod sca for the improvement of the karstmod base model performance without increasing the model structural complexity we proposed the sca routine method which pre processes the precipitation dataset as a model forcing input considering snow accumulation and snowmelt this routine is similar to the degree day routine such that both methods use temperature datasets to split the precipitation into different phases to a certain extent while the classical degree day routine collins 1934 martinec 1960 kustas et al 1994 considers two phases rain and snow the sca method takes into account three phases of the precipitation including rain mixed and snow furthermore by the proposed method each phase of the precipitation is spatially distributed to the catchment area using fractional sca data in the sca method three temperature thresholds are expressed by the 1 threshold temperature above which the precipitation occurs as rainfall tr c 2 threshold temperature below which the precipitation occurs as snow ts c and 3 threshold temperature at which snowmelt begins tm c apart from these three temperature thresholds the sca routine also needs degree day factor ddf mm c 1day 1 and snow cover area time series fig 1c in the routine snowi lwi and melti are calculated using eq 4 eq 5 and eq 6 in the days in which t s ti tr 4 snow i p i sca i max snow i 1 melt i 0 t s t i t r 5 lw i p i 1 sca i min melt i snow i 1 t s t i t r 6 melt i d d f t i t m t s t i t r where pi mmd 1 ti c and scai express precipitation air temperature and snow covered area corresponding to the day i in the time series respectively 2 4 parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis for the estimation of model parameters we carried out the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue approach beven and binley 1992 provided in the karstmod modeling platform the model parameter set was randomly sampled based on the uniform distribution assumption while the feasible parameter space was determined from the previous experiences çallı 2017 çallı and çelik 2018 çelik and çallı 2021 table 2 threshold values for each snow parameter including ddf ts tm tr were defined based on the prior knowledge about the study site çallı 2017 çelik et al 2018 çelik and çallı 2021 relevant literature e g martinec 1960 martinec and rango 1986 as well as the study site under similar hydro climatic conditions doummar et al 2018 by trial and error method we set to the constant values for ddf ts tm tr as 0 7 mm c 1day 1 2 c 0 c and 2 c respectively see appendix 5 we performed a combination of parameter tests including the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to examine the behaviors of the obtained parameter sets from each model in response to the implementation of the snow routines sobol sensitivity analysis sobol 1993 provided in karstmod is used to identify the most influential model parameter s and their contribution s to the model output variance e g borgonovo and plischke 2016 thereby revealing the most uncertain model parameters in our study we accepted si larger than 0 1 as the highly sensitive parameter while the value range between 0 01 and 0 1 refers to the less sensitive e g tang et al 2007 zhan et al 2013 to assess the reduction in the parameter uncertainty we considered the confinement in the behavioral parameter location using the percentile approach 25th and 75th percentiles similarly to reveal the model prediction uncertainty we comparatively evaluated the confinement in the 95 uncertainty bound of karstmod base to those coupled by the dd and sca routines 2 5 model performance evaluation the model performance analysis was performed against the observed daily spring discharge to assess the model skill we used nash sutcliff efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 as a performance metric in eq 7 7 nse 1 t 1 t q t sim q t obs 2 t 1 t q t obs q obs 2 where q t sim and q t obs are the simulated and observed discharges respectively while q obs represents the mean value of the observed discharge the three versions of the karsmod model karstmod base karstmod dd and karstmod sca were run 5 105 times to obtain the behavioral simulations we then selected the top 100 behavioral parameter sets from each model run for further parameter analysis for the model calibration scheme we applied the split sampling test procedure klemeš 1986 the 2 years model calibration covering the period of 01 10 2015 30 09 2017 was allocated for karstmod dd and karstmod sca whereas the period of 01 10 2017 13 07 2019 was used for the model validation the first 304 days of the year 2015 were kept for the spin up period for all three models however the calibration of karstmod base performed for the two years 01 10 2015 30 09 2017 does not satisfactorily capture the karst spring flow characteristics particularly under the peak flow conditions over the winter period during which the model completely misses the peak values of discharge for this reason for the karstmod base model conditioning we performed an extra one year model calibration 01 10 2015 and 30 09 2016 by following the methodology proposed by mcintyre and wheater 2004 doing that we kept the karstmod base model validation and warm up periods as identical as defined for karstmod dd and karstmod sca 3 case study 3 1 study area we tested the efficiency of our proposed sca routine in a snow dominated eastern mediterranean karstic aquifer located in the semi arid climate region in central taurus southern turkey the study area is one of the sub systems of the central taurus karst massive çelik and çallı 2021 discharging through the suğla polje fig 2 the elevation of the study area ranges from 1076 m the suğla polje to 2900 m above sea level the gidengelmez mountains according to the long term historical meteorological data record the average annual precipitation is approximately 780 mmy 1 and the mean annual air temperature is around 11 c mgm 2020 as one of the snow dominated karstic systems in the central taurus karst massive the snowpack plays a critical role in aquifer recharge in our site which is accounted for by virtually one third of the total groundwater recharge sourcing from the snowmelt çelik and çallı 2021 the study area mainly consists of the jurassic limestone units upper cretaceous ophiolites and a limited number of volcanic units e g blumenthal 1947a 1947b özgül 1976 fig 2c the carbonates are named after özgül 1997 as geyikdağı unit covered by the karstified jurassic limestone and dolomites as well as partly upper cretaceous pelagic limestones the limestones are highly permeable due to the intensive karstification in the carbonate units while the ophiolites are mainly impermeable fig 2c for that reason the carbonate covered site hosts numerous karstic features including caves sinkholes seasonal springs swallow holes and dissolution dolines fig 2c the dolines are placed in the high altitude zone of the gidengelmez mountains fig 2c which is covered by snow during at least half of a hydrological year the main recharge zone of the karst aquifer was delineated as approximately 60 km2 çelik 2017 çelik et al 2018 çallı 2021 yet a widespread of the limestone outcrop towards the summit of gidengelmez mountains potentially contributes to the aquifer recharge fig 2c the karstic aquifer system is actively discharged by several seasonal karstic springs in the study area all joining into the şehirçay channel flowing through to the suğla lake fig 2b while these karstic springs are mainly served for the province of seydişehir approx 100 000 population pınarbaşı spring is the only one monitored from december 2014 until now pınarbaşı spring is located on the southern side of seydişehir fig 2b and is supplied as the main drinking water resource the spring dries in the summer periods during which the active reservoir is mostly emptied with an approximate annual cumulative discharge of 18 million m3 the peak discharge of pınarbaşı spring is around 7 08 m3s 1 while the average spring discharge is represented by an approximate value of 0 49 m3s 1 3 2 datasets to simulate the karst spring discharge we used the observations of pınarbaşı daily discharge the daily meteorological data including total precipitation p the total of rain and snow and maximum tmax minimum tmin and mean 2 m air temperatures tmean were obtained from the turkish state meteorological service mgm 2020 for 3 meteorological stations located nearby the study area fig 2 while the daily net radiation li et al 2019 2020 and relative humidity airs project 2019 data were downloaded from the ges disc dataset

n u m b e r o f c e l l s 4 results 4 1 estimation of snow and liquid water the timing and magnitude of the karst aquifer recharge are mainly controlled by the snow and lw estimations of the snow routines fig 3 demonstrates the total snow storage simulated by the karstmod dd and karstmod sca models here the snow storage obtained from each model is inter compared for further understanding of model performances in turn examining parameter sensitivity and uncertainty on the simulation of the model internal states overall the main difference between karstmod dd and karstmod sca is the availability of the mixed phase of the precipitation in the snow simulations of karstmod sca considering the color scheme in fig 3 the blue segments represent the period in which the air temperature is below ts snow accumulates while the red segments account for the period in which the air temperature is above tr snowmelt however the yellow segments represent the period where the air temperature is between ts and tr mixed precipitation snow accumulation could occur over the blue and yellow parts of the graph but not in red whereas snowmelt could be tracked by the yellow and red parts of the line but not in blue in this regard increasing snow state in the red segments of the graph or decreasing snow state in the blue segments refer to the lack of representativeness of the snow routine karstmod dd only accumulates snow until the 2nd week of february particularly in the year 2017 while karstmod sca both accumulates and melts snow over the same period fig 3 hence the inconsistency between the color scheme and snow accumulation snowmelt mechanism is frequent in karstmod dd in 2016 2018 and 2019 whereas it could be only observed for a few days in mid january 2019 in karstmod sca fig 3 the simulated time series of lw by the karstmod dd and karstmod sca models are provided in fig 4 the main disagreement between the simulations can be seen throughout february april each year here while karstmod dd accumulates the precipitation as a form of snow in the mid late days of january 2019 karstmod sca releases more lw during those days this particular finding can be explained by the process consideration of the dd snow routine which essentially melts the snow in the storage in february 2019 during which relatively lower lw is obtained by the sca routine the same finding is also the case in mid march 2019 when the sca snow routine melts the snow in the storage as opposed to water release as lw by the karstmod dd model 4 2 model performance results three different versions of karstmod including karstmod base karstmod dd and karstmod sca are run for the simulation of pınarbaşı spring discharge over the years 2016 and 2017 the model performance results are provided in table 3 fig 5 demonstrates the best realizations which provide the highest nse values from the calibration of each model here the realizations are also accompanied by the 95 uncertainty bounds of the behavioral simulations overall karstmod base entirely misses the peak discharges fig 5a thus providing a poor model performance with a rather low nse metric nse 0 306 in calibration and nse 0 039 in the validation periods when the model was performed over the 2 year calibration period the years of 2016 and 2017 over which the model mainly captures no discharge values in the drier sub periods however when the calibration period for karstmod base was restricted to one hydrological year appendix 4 the model skill was directly improved nse 0 660 thereby leading to a good agreement with the observed spring discharge however the restriction of the calibration time leads to an increase in the uncertainty bound in the karstmod base model see appendix 4 overall coupling both snow routines with karstmod base allows the better simulation of spring discharge particularly resembling the peak discharges over the model calibration periods fig 5b 5c to a certain extent karstmod sca better captures the time and magnitude of the mid and high flows than that of karstmod dd fig 5 allowing to obtaining better nse statistics for both training 0 784 sca and 0 760 dd and validation 0 448 sca and 0 369 dd periods even though the optimal parameter set of karstmod dd results in a better agreement with the spring low flows the uncertainty bound in those periods is wider than karstmod sca fig 5d accordingly the addition of the snow routines in the karstmod base model either dd or sca substantially improves the model performance both in calibration and validation periods for the comparative evaluation of the model performance over the model calibration validation periods in each model the scatterplots of the observed and simulated discharges are provided in fig 6 here the simulated discharge values for high flows for the karstmod base model are more scattered around the 1 1 line than other versions where the independent validation results are even more dispersed than the training datasets for all versions fig 6 hence karstmod base indicates more biased for the validation period thereby underestimating the high flow characteristics during the model calibration 4 3 parameter sensitivity and uncertainty the sensitivity test result is provided in fig 7 overall hmaxe primarily impacts the model output variations as the most sensitive model parameter followed by αe and hmine while hmaxc is the least sensitive one si less than 0 001 here the parameter hmaxe is represented by the values of si 0 467 karstmod base 0 171 karstmod dd and 0 159 karstmod sca whereas αe and hmine are accounted for less than 0 1 for all three models regarding the model parameters characterizing the time of water transfer in the model reservoirs c e and m they do not profoundly influence the model output variations thus indicating the non influential model parameters with rather lower values of si ranging from 0 002 to 0 01 specifically the test results demonstrate that the models coupled with both snow routines do not necessarily affect the sensitivity of these three parameters tc te and tm the variation in the range of the behavioral parameter sets is provided in fig 8 overall the distribution of the model parameters hmaxc hmaxe and hmine obtained by the karstmod dd and karstmod sca versions are significantly different from those obtained by the karstmod base model thus ensuring the narrower interquartile range iqr here hmaxc demonstrates the substantial reduction by the karstmod base model coupled with both snow routines while the median and optimal values are nearly the same similarly the optimum values of hmaxe are represented by 42 mm and 57 mm and hmine are 10 8 mm and 16 5 mm in the karstmod dd and karstmod sca models respectively conversely it cannot be said that there is any further confinement in the model parameters regarding the recession a and time t here the iqr of a and t parameters do not demonstrate any reasonable reduction when both snow routines are implemented as the model preprocessing route fig 8 however as an important finding the optimum and median values of these parameters nearly overlap each other in karstmod sca while providing nearly the same parameter values with more certain values considering the reduction in iqr for instance the median value of epikarst parameter te day accounts for approximately 11 5 days while the optimum value is nearly 11 days by karstmod sca table 2 although a rather weak reduction in the parameter range is still justified by the karstmod sca model the probability density distributions pdfs of the 100 behavioral parameter sets of each model run are presented in appendix 2 the identical distributions can also be tracked over the most sensitive model parameters hmaxe and hmine here karstmod sca does ensure the more identifiable parameters demonstrating a central tendency thereby fulfilling the parameter uni modality in both parameter s density regions 4 4 model internal states to reveal to what extent the model parameters obtained by karstmod dd and karstmod sca vary the model internal states over the model structure we examine the water levels in the corresponding model compartments e m and c in fig 9 overall the karstmod base model simulates significantly high storage in the epikarst reservoir than the karstmod dd and karstmod sca models furthermore the karstmod sca model generates higher water storage in compartment e than that of the karstmod dd model thus resulting in lower water levels in c and m components karstmod dd tolerates the delay of recharge caused by the high values of snow while storing less water in compartment e especially during the snowmelt periods additionally karstmod sca leads to a relatively less amount of snow than karstmod dd here it is also visible that the best parameter set of each model defines a rather different model internal states particularly in compartment e similarly the water levels in compartment m substantially differ from each other as time continues 5 discussion 5 1 increment in the hydrological model skill a substantial increase in the performance of karstmod base was observed after reducing the calibration period from two years to one year appendix 4 this improvement can be explained by the modeler s intention to increase the model representativeness e g mcintyre and wheater 2004 seibert and beven 2009 only considering a particular period for our case one hydrological year in which the simulated discharges are successfully captured by the model however the reduction in the calibration period e g frank et al 2021 was criticized as a proper calibration approach to improve the model performance as it mostly reduces the model realism juston et al 2009 the approach therefore does not mean that the shorter period s could only be selected to improve the model realism while providing more representative model simulations with much confidence here the model realism with a degree of confidence should be associated with capturing the hydrological process that dominates the system of interest wagener et al 2003 which is not essentially simulated by the karstmod base model in this regard a fair improvement in the model performance is achieved by karstmod dd fig 5b however karstmod sca is more successful than karstmod dd in capturing the high and low flow characteristics of the spring discharge thus allowing to a fair reduction in the prediction uncertainty particularly over the snowmelt periods fig 5c 5d here the improvement in the model performance with the sca routine could be explained by the proper representation of the snow accumulation and snowmelt process based on the introduction of the mixed phase of the precipitation and the satellite based sca data from our findings defining the mixed phase of precipitation in the sca routine provides an advantage to improve karstmod sca skill as opposed to karstmod dd thus allowing to capturing the timing and magnitude of the low and high flows however the underestimation of the peak discharges by both karstmod dd and karstmod sca could be mainly attributed to the intermittent characteristics of the spring discharge to a certain extent as the simulation of the intermittent ephemeral discharge could result in a calibration problem particularly obtaining the consistent model parameters the artificial increment in the model skill could be seen while providing a perfect fit s over the drier periods however the process based information derived from these sub period s is still under the discussion seibert and beven 2009 because the model does not necessarily reflect the dominant hydrological characteristics e g seibert 2003 gharari et al 2013 for this reason even though the calibration approach ignoring specific periods either drier or wetter may increase the model skill the representation of the system hydrological functioning by the model could be rather inaccurate 5 2 assessment of the model parameter realism the sensitivity tests revealed that the most sensitive model parameters belong to the epikarst zone represented by hmaxe αe and hmine fig 7 all of which primarily affect the recharge process in the karstic aquifers especially in the well developed karst hydrological systems considering the sensitivity test results the si value of the most sensitive model parameter hmaxe 0 467 for the karstmod base model is decreased in karstmod dd 0 171 and karstmod sca 0 159 this means that the fractionation of the mixed phase of precipitation through the karstic catchment considering the satellite driven data fairly reduces the sensitivity of hmaxe fig 7 thus providing a more accurate value than that of the karstmod base model fig 8 this particular finding could be associated with the well representation of the karst aquifer recharge by the sca routine here the recharge as a mechanism is characteristically observed in the well developed karst system in which the water circulation is directly controlled by the epikarst zone mainly due to the lack of or very thin soil zone see fig 2c indeed this is especially true for the karstic aquifers developed in the high altitude regions where the epikarst zone acts as a water transmitter rather than a reservoir williams 1983 2008 therefore the epikarst zone distributes the recharge in time and space while defining the temporal delay of the aquifer recharge williams 1983 palmer 2006 bauer et al 2005 in this context considering the karstic characteristics of our study site since the average soil and epikarst thickness together could not exceed a few meters in our site the values for hmaxe 57 2 mm and hmine 16 5 mm in karstmod sca are more plausible as compared to those 572 2 and 62 9 mm respectively obtained by the karstmod base model the low values for both parameters could indicate the fact that there is less delay in the epikarst storage this finding is also confirmed by the physical characteristics of our karstic area since the lack of soil and vegetation cover do permit rather quick water infiltration through the groundwater reservoir without any delay regarding the physical meanings of model parameters hmine and hmaxe the lower values of hmine imply less water stored in the epikarst reservoir mazzilli et al 2019 whereas the lower hmaxe indicates the higher hydraulic conductivity of the epikarst reservoir which enables a rapid water transfer from the epikarst zone perrin et al 2003 to the groundwater reservoir therefore it is fair to infer that with the sca routine we could indirectly identify the appropriate time for water infiltration from the epikarst zone as opposed to the rather unrealistically obtained values by the karstmod base model considering the median values and the optimum parameter values of the epikarst parameters hmaxe hmine te and αe they are getting closer when karstmod sca was performed fig 8 in parallel with this the peak values of probability distributions for the sensitive parameters hmaxe αe and hmine are more consistent with the optimal parameter values appendix 2 this can be explained by the fact that the sca routine slightly better identifies the epikarst parameters than that of the dd snow routine from this point of view defining a mixed phase for the snowmelt process allows us to properly delineate the precipitation as a model input flux to obtain more robust simulations with better parameter confinement fig 8 furthermore owing to the mixed phase in the sca routine karstmod sca produces more continuous recharge than karstmod dd which indicates that the model compartments of karstmod sca are not artificially forced to withhold the incoming water to satisfy the water delay this clearly explains what is not considered by the karstmod base model structure resulting in rather higher values for hmaxc and hmaxm to keep the water storage high while simultaneously satisfying a longer delay as for the model parameters ax and tx since they were obtained by the recession and time series analysis çelik and çallı 2021 we did not define a wide parameter range for the model conditioning phase table 1 this therefore could be the reason why the further confinement was not obtained by karstmod sca and karstmod dd fig 8 conversely as the parameters controlling the water levels hmaxe hmine hmaxc and hmaxm are not easily measurable the rather wider parameter ranges for these parameters table 1 may explain the better confinement by both models consequently they provide better parameter identification with more distinct and condensed distribution spaces fig 8 especially for the most sensitive model parameters including hmaxe and hmine appendix 2 about the physical meaning of the recession constant α high values mostly imply the intensive karstification process over the karstic system malík and vojtková 2012 which in turn primarily causes rapid water transfer through the high conductive epikarst and conduit compartments as an ultimate fact a rapid water transfer in the system is characterized by a rather shorter transfer time t considering this the higher values of αc and lower values tc by karstmod dd and karstmod sca verify the rapid water transfer from the conduit compartment to the spring discharge while low hmaxc implies less water stored in the conduit reservoir due to the high conductivity here the obtained values of tc 2 73 days and te 10 9 days by the karstmod sca model are more consistent with the findings by çallı and çelik 2018 and çelik and çallı 2021 where the transit time of the conduit and fracture reservoirs were obtained 3 days tc and 13 days te respectively therefore the optimum values of these parameters by karstmod sca are reasonable while capturing the conduit dominated discharge characteristics of the test site concerning the recharge area ra it was estimated as 70 6 km2 by karstmod sca while indicating the recharge area for all karst springs including pınarbaşı spring the estimated value for ra was also supported by the water budget calculations provided in appendix 3 5 3 assessment of the model internal states model internal states are important signatures to reveal how accurate the model simulates the spring discharge even though the observations for the different model compartments including e m and c do not exist for our study even for most hydrological studies the simulated total storages by the different hydrological models over each compartment are inter compared for the improved understanding of the model performance in our study fig 9 as the main finding karstmod base did not produce the conduit storage for a long time during the calibration fig 9 due to the high storage in compartment e this finding however contradicts with the obtained values of recession coefficients in previous research by çallı and çelik 2018 and çelik and çallı 2021 both of which inform that the karst spring demonstrates the conduit dominated flow characteristics yet the model simulations by karstmod dd and karstmod sca are more consistent with the main outcomes of the previous studies e g çallı and çelik 2018 çelik and çallı 2021 one significant difference between karstmod dd and karstmod sca is that the water level in compartment c falls to zero in karstmod sca during the dry periods since pınarbaşı spring dries in the summer periods it is more accurate to simulate the water level in the conduit reservoir as zero mainly because of the conduit dominated discharge characteristics of the karst spring it is important to note that karstmod dd is forced to compensate for the underestimation of the epikarst storage while overestimating the storages in the matrix and conduit reservoirs fig 9 this can be attributed to the rough transition between the rain and snow phases of the precipitation input to a lesser extent karstmod dd only considers snow and does not produce lw in some days when ti tm during which karstmod sca simulates lw for the non snowy parts of the catchment this therefore results in more continuous recharge another important outcome from the lw estimations is that during the relatively warmer winters e g 2016 and 2018 there is not a significant difference between karstmod dd and karstmod sca however during the snow dominated hydrological years e g 2017 and 2019 the difference is much more visible fig 4 this would come from the measurement sensitivity of the modis sensors as it could not consider the snow until it reaches a certain density for that reason this uncertainty in the measurement over the modis sensors could be cross checked by either using the sca products from the different satellites or using ground based observations 6 conclusions this paper presents a newly proposed snow routine to increase the model representativeness of a karst hydrological model over the snow dominated mountainous karst aquifers the sca routine considers three phases of the precipitation rain snow and mixed phase and distributes each phase to the catchment via satellite driven sca data by the sca routine we increased the hydrological model performance while simultaneously obtaining physically meaningful parameter sets the key findings from our research are as followed the sca routine better processes the snow accumulation and snowmelt than the degree day method by dividing the precipitation into three phases and distributing them through the catchment using the satellite driven sca data although the substantial increase in karstmod sca performance over the karstmod dd is not observed the sca routine still ensures the physically meaningful parameter sets thereby providing less uncertain and more identifiable parameters yet the main difference between the models can be followed by the simulation of the model internal states 7 considerations and limitations the proposed method could be coupled with different hydrological models either lumped or distributed models the snow covered area products obtained from different satellites can also be used in the sca routine for the application of the sca routine we would recommend to divide the area of interest where the spatial coverage and topographic variability is high into the sub catchments considering the elevation zones and thus obtaining the tr ts tm and ddf parameters for each sub catchment based on the hydro climatological characteristics we do not claim that the sca routine is a perfect snow routine which always guarantee a better performance over the degree day method for instance selection of different performance metric s see appendix 5 and or increasing the ensemble of model runs e g tens of millions may depict an opposite performance result at this point the contribution of the sca routine to the model skill should be tracked by the parameter realism and physically meaningful model internal states funding tübi̇tak

china corresponding authors this manuscript was handled by andras bardossy editor in chief error correction methods play an important role in improving the reliability and accuracy of hydrological modeling the dynamic system response curve dsrc is a novel and effective error correction method but it may have the problem of over correction therefore two multi model integrated error correction models based on dsrc and bayesian model averaging bma were proposed in this paper namely dsrc bma and bma dsrc the sunshui river catchment is selected for a case study first three hydrological models including xinanjiang model xaj hydrologiska fyrans vattenbalans modell hbv and vertically hybrid yield model vhy were employed then a standard bma model and three dsrc based models were constructed separately finally two multi model integrated error correction models dsrc bma and bma dsrc were applied the performance of these nine models was compared by nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse and percent bias pbias results showed that the dsrc based models presented better results than the standard bma method and most dsrc based models moreover the uncertainty in bma dsrc bma and bma dsrc models were assessed the 90 confidence interval of the bma dsrc model had high containing ratio values and low average relative bandwidth overall the proposed multi model integrated error correction methods are effective and can be applicable in improving streamflow modeling keywords error correction method streamflow modeling bayesian model averaging dynamic system response curve 1 introduction hydrological modeling is an important nonstructural countermeasure in flood control and disaster reduction the accuracy largely depends on the hydrological models and model inputs e g rainfall and evaporation however multiple errors of hydrological models arising from model inputs structure and parameters could lead to reduced accuracy in hydrological modeling butts et al 2004 gupta et al 2012 fraga et al 2018 a widely used post processing approach to improving hydrological modeling is error correction techniques looper and vieux 2012 chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 there are mainly two kinds of error correction approaches that have been developed to improve model performance process error correction and terminal error correction liang et al 2021 the former approaches including input variable updating e g mcmillan et al 2011 worqlul et al 2017 state variable updating e g neal et al 2007 chen et al 2013 and parameter updating e g xie and zhang 2013 wu et al 2015 investigate the errors from different components of the hydrological models the kalman filter and its extensions are usually applied in this classification barthelemy et al 2017 ocio et al 2017 sun et al 2020 the latter approaches like output variables updating e g babovic et al 2001 li et al 2015 consider the model output as the integration of multi source errors and modifies the forecasted flow directly the autoregressive ar model is a typical terminal error correction method xiong and o connor 2002 pulukuri et al 2017 in recent a novel error correction method dynamic system response curve dsrc is proposed by bao et al 2014 it is a simple but effective error correction method based on the physical mechanism of flow concentration so far it has been used for runoff updating bao et al 2014 areal mean rainfall updating si et al 2015 si et al 2019 state variables updating sun et al 2018a sun et al 2018b and comprehensive error updating liang et al 2021 these applications demonstrate that the dsrc can improve hydrological forecasts without increasing complexity or model parameters zhang et al 2021 the theoretical basis is the differential of the system response function of the input variables and state variables the dsrc method approximates the nonlinear relationship between the model outputs and the model variables including state variables and input variables with the first order taylor linearization and describes these complex behaviors in simple matrix forms sun et al 2018a then the correction is performed using the least squares ls estimation when the dsrc method is applied to correct the input rainfall series it regards the rainfall as the main source of error in streamflow calculation in fact there are still other sources of error in hydrological modeling such as errors in the model structure this may lead to slight differences in rainfall correction results under different hydrological models and it is hard to determine which set of corrected rainfall series is the best to provide more accurate and reliable correction results we introduced bayesian model averaging bma methods to dsrc correction merging simulations from multiple models the bma method is a statistical procedure using the weighted average of probability distribution functions pdf of different individual forecasts for generating predictive forecast distributions darbandsari and coulibaly 2020 it has been widely reported that the bma approach can provide more accurate and reliable forecasts raftery et al 2005 duan et al 2007 arsenault et al 2015 huang et al 2019 here we proposed two multi model integrated error correction methods based on bma and dsrc to improve the accuracy of streamflow modeling of the many sources of error in model generated runoff estimates errors in areal mean rainfall estimates have been found to most directly affect the accuracy of the calculated runoff series chua and bras 1982 zquiza 1998 si et al 2015 thus this study aims to update areal mean rainfall and improve the accuracy of streamflow modeling via two different multi model integrated error correction procedures 2 methodology in this study nine models were used for daily streamflow simulation as presented in table 1 first three hydrological models xaj hbv and vhy model were performed then dynamic system response curve dsrc and bayesian model averaging bma methods were used separately based on three model simulations finally two multi model integrated error correction models were applied namely dsrc bma and bma dsrc the flowcharts of two multi model integrated error correction methods are shown in fig 1 the difference between them is whether dsrc is used directly after the hydrological model as shown in fig 1 a or after the bma has fused the hydrological model results as shown in fig 1 b the corrected streamflow results are compared to see if the dsrc bma and bma dsrc can further improve the streamflow simulations based on dsrc correction and the standard bma method 2 1 hydrological models the xinanjiang model xaj developed by zhao 1992 is a well known conceptual hydrological model and widely used in china since the 1970s the main feature of xaj model is the concept of the spatial distribution of storage capacity yao et al 2009 lu and li 2015 the runoff will not be generated until the soil moisture content reaches field capacity after which the runoff is equal to rainfall excess without further loss the generated runoff is then divided into the surface runoff interflow and groundwater overall the xaj model includes a three layer evapotranspiration sub model a runoff production sub model a runoff separation sub model and a runoff concentration sub model the hydrologiska fyrans vattenbalans modell hbv is a conceptual hydrological model of swedish origin bergström and forsman 1973 the hbv model has been well applied under different climatic conditions lindström et al 1997 it consists of four submodules for snow accumulation and snowmelt soil moisture runoff response and simple routing the actual evaporation is obtained by a linear function and decreases as the soil moisture drops ye et al 2013 the runoff producing process is described by two reservoir layers for fast and slow flows respectively in the hbv model at last the runoff generated from these two reservoirs is routed based on a transformation function since the study area seldom snows thus the snow module was not included in the hbv model used in this study the vertically hybrid yield model vhy developed by bao and wang 1997 is a lumped hydrological model and has been employed in many areas in china wang and ren 2009 li et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 lin et al 2020 the main feature of vhy model is its consideration of saturating excess and infiltration excess runoff generation mechanisms simultaneously in a vertical direction the surface runoff depends on rainfall intensity and infiltration called infiltration excess mechanism while the subsurface runoff depends on the soil water deficit and infiltration water called as saturate excess mechanism 2 2 dynamic system response curve dsrc the rainfall runoff model can be expressed mathematically as 1 q f p e x θ where q q 1 q 2 q n t denotes a time ordered vector of discharge at the outlet p p 1 p 2 p n t and e e 1 e 2 e n t denotes the corresponding vectors of areal mean rainfall and evapotranspiration x x 1 x 2 x m t is the vector of model state variable and θ is the model parameters vector n denotes the number of discharges and m denotes the number of model state variables the model parameters θ can be adjusted to describe the hydrological response characteristics of the basin once calibrated it will not be changed in the short term bárdossy and singh 2008 smith et al 2014 in this study we consider the areal mean rainfall p as the main contributor to the error in hydrological modeling therefore the equation 1 can be expressed more simply as 2 q p f p the above equation can be differentiated to the changes in the areal mean rainfall as below si et al 2015 3 dq q p p p p 0 d p where p 0 represents the current best estimate of the areal mean rainfall while q p p p p 0 denotes the sensitivity coefficient of system response when the areal mean rainfall is p 0 thus the observed streamflow for some other areal mean rainfall series p can be approximately rewritten as equation 4 based on the first order taylor expansion technique 4 q p q p 0 q p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q p p k p p 0 δ p k where k k n is the number of periods of areal mean rainfall involved in the correction for streamflow sequence q q 1 q 2 q n t the above equation can be expressed as below in equation 5 5 q 1 p q 1 p 0 q 1 p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q 1 p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q 1 p p k p p 0 δ p k q 2 p q 2 p 0 q 2 p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q 2 p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q 2 p p k p p 0 δ p k q n p q n p 0 q n p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q n p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q n p p k p p 0 δ p k written in matrix form as 6 q p δ p q p u δ p with 7 u q 1 p p 1 q 1 p p 2 q 1 p p k q 2 p p 1 q 2 p p 2 q 2 p p k q n p p 1 q n p p 2 q n p p k where the matrix u is defined as a system response matrix δ p denotes the correction term to be solved it is assumed that δ q can be approximately substituted by q obs q as displayed in equation 8 so the correction vector δ p can be updated with known δ q and u according to equation 9 8 u δ p δ q q obs q 9 δ p u t u 1 u t q obs q 2 3 bayesian model averaging bma the bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical processing method for multi model ensemble processing more reliability and accuracy than the original ensemble method raftery et al 2005 darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 assume that yt t 1 2 t is the forecasted variable m 1 m 2 m k are k considered models ensemble members and d is the observations of the calibration period the posterior distribution of the bma forecast yt t 1 2 t can be written as 10 p y t m 1 m 2 m k d i 1 k p y t m i d p m i d where p y t m i d is the posterior distribution of yt given the prediction of mi and observed data d p m i d is the likelihood of model mi on the condition of observed data d this likelihood is denoted as the weight of model mi being the optimal model reflecting how well this particular ensemble member matches the observations duan et al 2007 if p m i d is denoted as w i thus i 1 k w i 1 in essence the ensemble result of bma pdf is an average of the posterior distributions under each of the models considered weighted by their posterior model probability hoeting et al 1999 it is assumed that the model forecasts are unbiased thus before the bma implementation bias correction methods e g linear regression should be applied to guarantee the expected value of the difference between observation and each model forecasts being equal to zero namely e y mi 0 the bias corrected forecasts fi can be obtained for the original forecast of model mi in this study the box cox transformation is taken for the convenience of using a gaussian distribution box and cox 1964 11 f i a i b i m i where ai and bi are the coefficients of the linear regression model the mean value and variance of y are expressed as 12 e y t m 1 m 2 m k d i 1 k w i f i 13 var y t m 1 m 2 m k d i 1 k w i f i j 1 k w j f j 2 i 1 k w i σ i 2 successful application of the bma method requires proper estimation of the parameters weights wi and variances σ i 2 of each model forecast in this study the em algorithm mclachlan and krishnan 1997 he et al 2018 is used to maximize the log likelihood function as shown in equation 14 of the parameter vector θ w i σ i i 1 2 k 14 l θ log i 1 k w i p y f i d in this study the mean value of y is used as the deterministic result of bma model the monte carlo method is used to generate bma probabilistic forecast at any time t after estimating the weight and variance the details of monte carlo procedure can be found in zhou et al 2016 overall three hydrological models xaj hbv and vhy model as well as three error correction models dsrc dsrc bma and bma dsrc are implemented in this study besides a basic bma model that directly fused the simulated streamflow of hydrological models is conducted as a benchmark model 3 case study 3 1 study area and data in this study three sets of hydrological models were used for streamflow modeling the input of the three models are areal mean rainfall and evapotranspiration and the output is the discharge at the basin outlet the lumped modeling is adopted these models are run on a daily scale the sunshui river is the second tributary of yalong river located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the terrain elevation of the sunshui river watershed ranges from 1633 to 4407 m above sea level the river has a drainage area of 1611 km2 and an average annual discharge of 40 3 m3 s the daily rainfall potential evapotranspiration and runoff series of the sunshui river at sunshuiguan station fig 2 from 2008 to 2015 were used to facilitate the comparison of the different hydrological models and error correction methods the data were collected from the china hydrological yearbook there were no missing values in the data series 3 2 performance statistics 1 performance statistics for evaluating the deterministic models the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse and percent bias pbias are adopted these statistics are computed as follows moriasi et al 2007 15 nse 1 t 1 t o t s t 2 t 1 t o t o 2 16 rmse 1 t t 1 t o t s t 2 17 pbias t 1 t o t s t 100 t 1 t o t where o t denotes the observed streamflow at time t s t denotes the simulated streamflow at time t o denotes the average of observed streamflow and t symbolizes the total number of observations nse ranges between and 1 with nse 1 being optimal rmse and pbias values of 0 indicate a perfect fit between observations and simulations 2 performance statistics for evaluating the confidence interval the containing ratio cr average relative bandwidth rb and average relative deviation amplitude rd are used to assess the uncertainty intervals generated by bma dsrc bma and bma dsrc methods these statistics are computed as follows huang et al 2019 18 cr c t 1 t s t l o t s t u t 100 19 rb 1 t t 1 t s t u s t l o t 20 rd 1 t t 1 t 1 2 s t u s t l o t o t where s t l denotes the lower bound corresponding to 5 quantile at time t s t u denotes the upper bound corresponding to 95 quantile at time t c t 1 t is the number of the observations that satisfy the inequality conditions the cr ranges from 0 to 1 and a higher cr indicates a better simulation because it means more observed discharges are enveloped by the estimated bounds it is ideal for rb and rd to be as small as possible 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrological models comparison the calibration period is from 2008 to 2012 and the validation period is from 2013 to 2015 for the three hydrological models in this paper the multi objective optimization technique was applied to find the optimal values of the parameters in the hydrological models the measures of nse rmse and pbias were considered and assigned with equal weights and converted to a comprehensive objective for parameter optimization the associated parameters were optimized with the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 and listed in table 2 the performance of the three hydrological models were compared statistically and intuitively table 3 provided a summary of statistics of simulations by the selected hydrological models and mean output of bma method for both calibration and validation periods in the calibration period all the models had nse values exceeding 0 80 and pbias values within the range of 3 the rmse values of the three models were relatively close to 22 m3 s in the validation period the involved hydrological models obtained nse values larger than 0 87 and rmse values lower than 15 m3 s the statistics of all three models in the validation period were better than those of the calibration period this is because the observed daily streamflow is more dramatic in the calibration period with the annual maximum of daily flow fluctuating from 180 m3 s to 856 m3 s however during the validation period the annual maximum of daily flow fluctuates within the range of 315 m3 s to 363 m3 s that is the simulation of the validation period was equivalent to an average case simulation and therefore had a higher accuracy overall the values of rmse and nse in table 3 indicated that all the models produced good results for calibration and validation periods among the three hydrological modes the vhy model had the highest nse value 0 847 and the lowest rmse value 18 8 m3 s the xaj model exhibited a slightly lower accuracy than the rest two models with an nse of 0 821 and an rmse of 20 3 m3 s the pbias values of all models were within 5 indicating that the systematic errors of the models are acceptable therefore the calibrated parameters of the three hydrological models were reasonable besides a standard bma model was employed as a benchmark model based on the three aforementioned hydrological models based on table 3 it is clear that the mean output of bma model had better performance than xaj model and hbv model and the absolute of nse values were improved by 0 02 and the nse value of bma model is close to that of the vhy model it can be seen that the bma model outperforms most of the individual hydrological models but this improvement is limited taken together these results suggested that all three models can reproduce historical daily streamflow series with acceptable accuracy the scatter plot and the results of regression analysis are displayed in fig 3 the three models experienced acceptable fluctuations with the observed data it can be seen that the simulations from vhy model had a higher correlation r2 0 853 with the observations compared to xaj r2 0 83 and hbv model r2 0 836 based on the hydrographs in fig 3 overestimation and underestimation were observed for some years for instance the models underestimated the 2012 maximum daily flow simulations to varying degrees by about 30 the simulated values were also a bit lower than the observations in the 2009 and 2011 simulations moreover overestimation occurred in 2014 and 2015 in the three hydrological models the scatter plot of bma reflected a weighted average result of three hydrological models thus no significant improvement was observed in accuracy compared to other models 4 2 error correction methods application and comparison three dsrc based streamflow corrections xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc and two multi model integrated error correction methods dsrc bma and bma dsrc were conducted in the sunshui river catchment the comparison between observations and these corrected simulations was described in fig 4 and their corresponding performance statistics were displayed in table 3 according to fig 4 the scatters of dsrc based corrections were more concentrated to 1 1 line than the hydrological modeling results and have an obvious effect in high flow correction among them vhy dsrc had a higher precision as depicted in table 4 the vhy dsrc model decreased the rmse value of vhy model by approximately 50 from 18 8 m3 s to 9 5 m3 s the nse value of vhy model improved from 0 847 to 0 961 compared to the raw hydrological simulations the xaj dsrc model and hbv dsrc model also witnessed a rise in rmses by a similar amount therefore dsrc can provide a good way for error correction in streamflow modeling as seen in fig 4 the proposed two multi model integrated error correction methods can enhance the model performance to a certain extent compared to dsrc bma model r2 0 958 the calculated streamflow of bma dsrc model exhibited a higher fitness to the observed streamflow r2 0 985 it can be obtained from table 4 that bma dsrc model provided the best corrections among the five error correction applications with the highest nse 0 985 and lowest rmse 5 9 m3 s however the dsrc bma model yielded the third best accuracy with nse 0 957 and rmse 9 9 m3 s which was slightly worse than vhy dsrc method similar accuracy trends were shown in the calibration period and validation period probably limited by the last step of bma application in dsrc bma model it can only provide a relatively reliable result which is better than most simulation members like xaj dsrc and hbv dsrc but hardly better than the optimal individual simulation vhy dsrc the pbias of these correction results were ranging from 0 41 to 2 46 which is acceptable fig 5 presented the rmse nse and pbias values of different correction methods in each year in most years except 2012 the rmse values of other years were lower than 15 m3 s while the nse values of other years were higher than 0 9 in 2012 it is clear that the bma dsrc model had the smallest rmse and highest nse values among the five correction methods followed by vhy dsrc method and dsrc bma method in 2008 and 2015 all models appeared overestimated to a different extent from 2009 to 2011 most models showed underestimation except vhy dsrc model overall the annual average pbias fluctuated within 5 4 3 uncertainty analysis of bma applications fig 6 depicted the estimated weights of individual models in the bma dsrc bma and bma dsrc methods obtained based on the data in the calibration period in the bma model the xaj model was assigned to lower weight than the hbv and vhy model a similar trend can be observed in the bma dsrc model the weight distribution showed that the hbv and vhy model yielded slightly better performance than the xaj model in this case study in the dsrc bma model the weights of xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc were relatively close overall the weights were between 0 31 and 0 35 indicating that the three members involved had equal proportions in bma applications fig 7 described the uncertainty bands of bma dsrc bma and bma dsrc methods with the 90 confidence interval the performance of the confidence interval was evaluated by coverage ratio cr average relative bandwidth rb and average relative deviation amplitude rd as listed in table 5 the cr is the ratio of the number of observations that falls in the confidence interval to the number of total observations fig 7 showed that most of the observed data points were within the 90 confidence interval of the bma model with a cr of 86 58 although the interval width of the bma model was generally narrow some of the high and medium flow observations were outside of the interval especially for the years 2012 to 2015 compared to the bma model the dsrc bma and bma dsrc models had higher cr values of 98 19 and 95 28 respectively however in terms of rb both the dsrc bma model and bma dsrc model had higher values than the bma model this may be because the dsrc bma model and bma dsrc model simulated medium and high flows better the variance of the simulated values increased and therefore the relative bandwidths were expanded to varying degrees moreover the bma dsrc model exhibited the lowest rd compared to the rest two bma based models as a whole the bma dsrc model yielded a high cr and low rb and rd indicating that it can reflect most of the observed information in a relatively narrow uncertainty band therefore the bma dsrc model seems to be the robust and the most effective of the three models 5 conclusions hydrological modeling is an important tool in flood mitigation and water resources management worldwide so using the error correction methods to improve the accuracy of streamflow modeling is an operational priority the dsrc method is simple effective and based on the physical mechanism of flow concentration it can improve modeling accuracy without increasing model parameters and has been widely used in hydrological modeling however when the dsrc method is applied to correct the input rainfall series it regards the rainfall as the main source of error in streamflow calculation actually there are still other sources of error in hydrological modeling such as errors in the model structure hence the corrected rainfall series generated from different hydrological models by dsrc may vary slightly and it is hard to determine which corrected rainfall series is optimal therefore we developed two multi model integrated error correction methods based on dsrc and bma to enhance the accuracy of daily streamflow modeling namely dsrc bma and bma dsrc meanwhile the uncertainty of the proposed methods in daily streamflow simulation was assessed the developed methods and their benchmark models were tested in a real case study at the sunshui river catchment the main conclusions were summarized as follows 1 the xaj model hbv model and vhy model were implemented to daily streamflow modeling in the study area and showed acceptable accuracy results showed that the vhy had a better performance than the other two hydrological models moreover a standard bma method was used to merge the streamflow simulations from xaj hbv and vhy models but it presented a limited ability to improve the accuracy 2 compared to the bma method the dsrc based approaches including xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc showed a significant improvement in model accuracy the vhy dsrc model decreased the rmse value of vhy model by approximately 50 from 18 8 m3 s to 9 5 m3 s the nse value of vhy model improved from 0 847 to 0 961 3 compared to the raw hydrological modeling the developed two multi model integrated error correction methods dsrc bma and bma dsrc can enhance the model performance to a certain extent the bma dsrc model provided the best results among the five error correction applications with the highest nse 0 985 and lowest rmse 5 9 m3 s but the dsrc bma model had a slightly worse performance than bma dsrc and vhy dsrc models 4 the uncertainty of bma dsrc bma and bma dsrc models were evaluated by three commonly used indicators cr rb and rd the results showed that the bma dsrc model yielded a high coverage ratio and low values in average relative bandwidth and average relative deviation amplitude so the bma dsrc method is effective and robust in daily streamflow modeling future work will explore the benefits of the improved method in more general applications such as using other variables for error correction coupling with other environmental models in addition the error of different sources needs to be further analyzed in the future

china corresponding authors this manuscript was handled by andras bardossy editor in chief error correction methods play an important role in improving the reliability and accuracy of hydrological modeling the dynamic system response curve dsrc is a novel and effective error correction method but it may have the problem of over correction therefore two multi model integrated error correction models based on dsrc and bayesian model averaging bma were proposed in this paper namely dsrc bma and bma dsrc the sunshui river catchment is selected for a case study first three hydrological models including xinanjiang model xaj hydrologiska fyrans vattenbalans modell hbv and vertically hybrid yield model vhy were employed then a standard bma model and three dsrc based models were constructed separately finally two multi model integrated error correction models dsrc bma and bma dsrc were applied the performance of these nine models was compared by nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse and percent bias pbias results showed that the dsrc based models presented better results than the standard bma method and most dsrc based models moreover the uncertainty in bma dsrc bma and bma dsrc models were assessed the 90 confidence interval of the bma dsrc model had high containing ratio values and low average relative bandwidth overall the proposed multi model integrated error correction methods are effective and can be applicable in improving streamflow modeling keywords error correction method streamflow modeling bayesian model averaging dynamic system response curve 1 introduction hydrological modeling is an important nonstructural countermeasure in flood control and disaster reduction the accuracy largely depends on the hydrological models and model inputs e g rainfall and evaporation however multiple errors of hydrological models arising from model inputs structure and parameters could lead to reduced accuracy in hydrological modeling butts et al 2004 gupta et al 2012 fraga et al 2018 a widely used post processing approach to improving hydrological modeling is error correction techniques looper and vieux 2012 chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 there are mainly two kinds of error correction approaches that have been developed to improve model performance process error correction and terminal error correction liang et al 2021 the former approaches including input variable updating e g mcmillan et al 2011 worqlul et al 2017 state variable updating e g neal et al 2007 chen et al 2013 and parameter updating e g xie and zhang 2013 wu et al 2015 investigate the errors from different components of the hydrological models the kalman filter and its extensions are usually applied in this classification barthelemy et al 2017 ocio et al 2017 sun et al 2020 the latter approaches like output variables updating e g babovic et al 2001 li et al 2015 consider the model output as the integration of multi source errors and modifies the forecasted flow directly the autoregressive ar model is a typical terminal error correction method xiong and o connor 2002 pulukuri et al 2017 in recent a novel error correction method dynamic system response curve dsrc is proposed by bao et al 2014 it is a simple but effective error correction method based on the physical mechanism of flow concentration so far it has been used for runoff updating bao et al 2014 areal mean rainfall updating si et al 2015 si et al 2019 state variables updating sun et al 2018a sun et al 2018b and comprehensive error updating liang et al 2021 these applications demonstrate that the dsrc can improve hydrological forecasts without increasing complexity or model parameters zhang et al 2021 the theoretical basis is the differential of the system response function of the input variables and state variables the dsrc method approximates the nonlinear relationship between the model outputs and the model variables including state variables and input variables with the first order taylor linearization and describes these complex behaviors in simple matrix forms sun et al 2018a then the correction is performed using the least squares ls estimation when the dsrc method is applied to correct the input rainfall series it regards the rainfall as the main source of error in streamflow calculation in fact there are still other sources of error in hydrological modeling such as errors in the model structure this may lead to slight differences in rainfall correction results under different hydrological models and it is hard to determine which set of corrected rainfall series is the best to provide more accurate and reliable correction results we introduced bayesian model averaging bma methods to dsrc correction merging simulations from multiple models the bma method is a statistical procedure using the weighted average of probability distribution functions pdf of different individual forecasts for generating predictive forecast distributions darbandsari and coulibaly 2020 it has been widely reported that the bma approach can provide more accurate and reliable forecasts raftery et al 2005 duan et al 2007 arsenault et al 2015 huang et al 2019 here we proposed two multi model integrated error correction methods based on bma and dsrc to improve the accuracy of streamflow modeling of the many sources of error in model generated runoff estimates errors in areal mean rainfall estimates have been found to most directly affect the accuracy of the calculated runoff series chua and bras 1982 zquiza 1998 si et al 2015 thus this study aims to update areal mean rainfall and improve the accuracy of streamflow modeling via two different multi model integrated error correction procedures 2 methodology in this study nine models were used for daily streamflow simulation as presented in table 1 first three hydrological models xaj hbv and vhy model were performed then dynamic system response curve dsrc and bayesian model averaging bma methods were used separately based on three model simulations finally two multi model integrated error correction models were applied namely dsrc bma and bma dsrc the flowcharts of two multi model integrated error correction methods are shown in fig 1 the difference between them is whether dsrc is used directly after the hydrological model as shown in fig 1 a or after the bma has fused the hydrological model results as shown in fig 1 b the corrected streamflow results are compared to see if the dsrc bma and bma dsrc can further improve the streamflow simulations based on dsrc correction and the standard bma method 2 1 hydrological models the xinanjiang model xaj developed by zhao 1992 is a well known conceptual hydrological model and widely used in china since the 1970s the main feature of xaj model is the concept of the spatial distribution of storage capacity yao et al 2009 lu and li 2015 the runoff will not be generated until the soil moisture content reaches field capacity after which the runoff is equal to rainfall excess without further loss the generated runoff is then divided into the surface runoff interflow and groundwater overall the xaj model includes a three layer evapotranspiration sub model a runoff production sub model a runoff separation sub model and a runoff concentration sub model the hydrologiska fyrans vattenbalans modell hbv is a conceptual hydrological model of swedish origin bergström and forsman 1973 the hbv model has been well applied under different climatic conditions lindström et al 1997 it consists of four submodules for snow accumulation and snowmelt soil moisture runoff response and simple routing the actual evaporation is obtained by a linear function and decreases as the soil moisture drops ye et al 2013 the runoff producing process is described by two reservoir layers for fast and slow flows respectively in the hbv model at last the runoff generated from these two reservoirs is routed based on a transformation function since the study area seldom snows thus the snow module was not included in the hbv model used in this study the vertically hybrid yield model vhy developed by bao and wang 1997 is a lumped hydrological model and has been employed in many areas in china wang and ren 2009 li et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 lin et al 2020 the main feature of vhy model is its consideration of saturating excess and infiltration excess runoff generation mechanisms simultaneously in a vertical direction the surface runoff depends on rainfall intensity and infiltration called infiltration excess mechanism while the subsurface runoff depends on the soil water deficit and infiltration water called as saturate excess mechanism 2 2 dynamic system response curve dsrc the rainfall runoff model can be expressed mathematically as 1 q f p e x θ where q q 1 q 2 q n t denotes a time ordered vector of discharge at the outlet p p 1 p 2 p n t and e e 1 e 2 e n t denotes the corresponding vectors of areal mean rainfall and evapotranspiration x x 1 x 2 x m t is the vector of model state variable and θ is the model parameters vector n denotes the number of discharges and m denotes the number of model state variables the model parameters θ can be adjusted to describe the hydrological response characteristics of the basin once calibrated it will not be changed in the short term bárdossy and singh 2008 smith et al 2014 in this study we consider the areal mean rainfall p as the main contributor to the error in hydrological modeling therefore the equation 1 can be expressed more simply as 2 q p f p the above equation can be differentiated to the changes in the areal mean rainfall as below si et al 2015 3 dq q p p p p 0 d p where p 0 represents the current best estimate of the areal mean rainfall while q p p p p 0 denotes the sensitivity coefficient of system response when the areal mean rainfall is p 0 thus the observed streamflow for some other areal mean rainfall series p can be approximately rewritten as equation 4 based on the first order taylor expansion technique 4 q p q p 0 q p p 1 p p 0 δ p 1 q p p 2 p p 0 δ p 2 q p p k p p 0 δ p k where k k n is the number of periods of areal mean rainfall involved in the correction for streamflow sequence q q 1 q 2 q n t the above equation can be expressed as below in equation 5 5 q 1 p q 1 p 0 q 1 p p 1 p p 0 δ

multi model ensemble processing more reliability and accuracy than the original ensemble method raftery et al 2005 darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 assume that yt t 1 2 t is the forecasted variable m 1 m 2 m k are k considered models ensemble members and d is the observations of the calibration period the posterior distribution of the bma forecast yt t 1 2 t can be written as 10 p y t m 1 m 2 m k d i 1 k p y t m i d p m i d where p y t m i d is the posterior distribution of yt given the prediction of mi and observed data d p m i d is the likelihood of model mi on the condition of observed data d this likelihood is denoted as the weight of model mi being the optimal model reflecting how well this particular ensemble member matches the observations duan et al 2007 if p m i d is denoted as w i thus i 1 k w i 1 in essence the ensemble result of bma pdf is an average of the posterior distributions under each of the models considered weighted by their posterior model probability hoeting et al 1999 it is assumed that the model forecasts are unbiased thus before the bma implementation bias correction methods e g linear regression should be applied to guarantee the expected value of the difference between observation and each model forecasts being equal to zero namely e y mi 0 the bias corrected forecasts fi can be obtained for the original forecast of model mi in this study the box cox transformation is taken for the convenience of using a gaussian distribution box and cox 1964 11 f i a i b i m i where ai and bi are the coefficients of the linear regression model the mean value

hydrological models xaj hbv and vhy model as well as three error correction models dsrc dsrc bma and bma dsrc are implemented in this study besides a basic bma model that directly fused the simulated streamflow of hydrological models is conducted as a benchmark model 3 case study 3 1 study area and data in this study three sets of hydrological models were used for streamflow modeling the input of the three models are areal mean rainfall and evapotranspiration and the output is the discharge at the basin outlet the lumped modeling is adopted these models are run on a daily scale the sunshui river is the second tributary of yalong river located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the terrain elevation of the sunshui river watershed ranges from 1633 to 4407 m above sea level the river has a drainage area of 1611 km2 and an average annual discharge of 40 3 m3 s the daily rainfall potential evapotranspiration and runoff series of the sunshui river at sunshuiguan station fig 2 from 2008 to 2015 were used to facilitate the comparison of the different hydrological models and error correction methods the data were collected from the china hydrological yearbook there were no missing values in the data series 3 2 performance statistics 1 performance statistics for evaluating the deterministic models the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse root mean squared error rmse and percent bias pbias are adopted these statistics are computed as follows moriasi et al 2007 15 nse 1 t 1 t o t s t 2 t 1 t o t o 2 16 rmse 1 t t 1 t o t s t 2 17 pbias t 1 t o t s t 100 t 1 t o t where o t denotes the observed streamflow at time t s t denotes the simulated streamflow at time t o denotes the average of observed streamflow and t symbolizes the total number of observations nse ranges between and 1 with nse 1 being optimal rmse and pbias values of 0 indicate a perfect fit between observations and simulations 2 performance statistics for evaluating the confidence interval the containing ratio cr average relative bandwidth rb and average relative deviation amplitude rd are used to assess the uncertainty intervals generated by bma dsrc bma and bma dsrc methods these statistics are computed as follows huang et al 2019 18 cr c t 1 t s t l o t s t u t 100 19 rb 1 t t 1 t s t u s t l o t 20 rd 1 t t 1 t 1 2 s t u s t l o t o t where s t l denotes the lower bound corresponding to 5 quantile at time t s t u denotes the upper bound corresponding to 95 quantile at time t c t 1 t is the number of the observations that satisfy the inequality conditions the cr ranges from 0 to 1 and a higher cr indicates a better simulation because it means more observed discharges are enveloped by the estimated bounds it is ideal for rb and rd to be as small as possible 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrological models comparison the calibration period is from 2008 to 2012 and the validation period is from 2013 to 2015 for the three hydrological models in this paper the multi objective optimization technique was applied to find the optimal values of the parameters in the hydrological models the measures of nse rmse and pbias were considered and assigned with equal weights and converted to a comprehensive objective for parameter optimization the associated parameters were optimized with the sce ua algorithm duan et al 1992 and listed in table 2 the performance of the three hydrological models were compared statistically and intuitively table 3 provided a summary of statistics of simulations by the selected hydrological models and mean output of bma method for both calibration and validation periods in the calibration period all the models had nse values exceeding 0 80 and pbias values within the range of 3 the rmse values of the three models were relatively close to 22 m3 s in the validation period the involved hydrological models obtained nse values larger than 0 87 and rmse values lower than 15 m3 s the statistics of all three models in the validation period were better than those of the calibration period this is because the observed daily streamflow is more dramatic in the calibration period with the annual maximum of daily flow fluctuating from 180 m3 s to 856 m3 s however during the validation period the annual maximum of daily flow fluctuates within the range of 315 m3 s to 363 m3 s that is the simulation of the validation period was equivalent to an average case simulation and therefore had a higher accuracy overall the values of rmse and nse in table 3 indicated that all the models produced good results for calibration and validation periods among the three hydrological modes the vhy model had the highest nse value 0 847 and the lowest rmse value 18 8 m3 s the xaj model exhibited a slightly lower accuracy than the rest two models with an nse of 0 821 and an rmse of 20 3 m3 s the pbias values of all models were within 5 indicating that the systematic errors of the models are acceptable therefore the calibrated parameters of the three hydrological models were reasonable besides a standard bma model was employed as a benchmark model based on the three aforementioned hydrological models based on table 3 it is clear that the mean output of bma model had better performance than xaj model and hbv model and the absolute of nse values were improved by 0 02 and the nse value of bma model is close to that of the vhy model it can be seen that the bma model outperforms most of the individual hydrological models but this improvement is limited taken together these results suggested that all three models can reproduce historical daily streamflow series with acceptable accuracy the scatter plot and the results of regression analysis are displayed in fig 3 the three models experienced acceptable fluctuations with the observed data it can be seen that the simulations from vhy model had a higher correlation r2 0 853 with the observations compared to xaj r2 0 83 and hbv model r2 0 836 based on the hydrographs in fig 3 overestimation and underestimation were observed for some years for instance the models underestimated the 2012 maximum daily flow simulations to varying degrees by about 30 the simulated values were also a bit lower than the observations in the 2009 and 2011 simulations moreover overestimation occurred in 2014 and 2015 in the three hydrological models the scatter plot of bma reflected a weighted average result of three hydrological models thus no significant improvement was observed in accuracy compared to other models 4 2 error correction methods application and comparison three dsrc based streamflow corrections xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc and two multi model integrated error correction methods dsrc bma and bma dsrc were conducted in the sunshui river catchment the comparison between observations and these corrected simulations was described in fig 4 and their corresponding performance statistics were displayed in table 3 according to fig 4 the scatters of dsrc based corrections were more concentrated to 1 1 line than the hydrological modeling results and have an obvious effect in high flow correction among them vhy dsrc had a higher precision as depicted in table 4 the vhy dsrc model decreased the rmse value of vhy model by approximately 50 from 18 8 m3 s to 9 5 m3 s the nse value of vhy model improved from 0 847 to 0 961 compared to the raw hydrological simulations the xaj dsrc model and hbv dsrc model also witnessed a rise in rmses by a similar amount therefore dsrc can provide a good way for error correction in streamflow modeling as seen in fig 4 the proposed two multi model integrated error correction methods can enhance the model performance to a certain extent compared to dsrc bma model r2 0 958 the calculated streamflow of bma dsrc model exhibited a higher fitness to the observed streamflow r2 0 985 it can be obtained from table 4 that bma dsrc model provided the best corrections among the five error correction applications with the highest nse 0 985 and lowest rmse 5 9 m3 s however the dsrc bma model yielded the third best accuracy with nse 0 957 and rmse 9 9 m3 s which was slightly worse than vhy dsrc method similar accuracy trends were shown in the calibration period and validation period probably limited by the last step of bma application in dsrc bma model it can only provide a relatively reliable result which is better than most simulation members like xaj dsrc and hbv dsrc but hardly better than the optimal individual simulation vhy dsrc the pbias of these correction results were ranging from 0 41 to 2 46 which is acceptable fig 5 presented the rmse nse and pbias values of different correction methods in each year in most years except 2012 the rmse values of other years were lower than 15 m3 s while the nse values of other years were higher than 0 9 in 2012 it is clear that the bma dsrc model had the smallest rmse and highest nse values among the five correction methods followed by vhy dsrc method and dsrc bma method in 2008 and 2015 all models appeared overestimated to a different extent from 2009 to 2011 most models showed underestimation except vhy dsrc model overall the annual average pbias fluctuated within 5 4 3 uncertainty analysis of bma applications fig 6 depicted the estimated weights of individual models in the bma dsrc bma and bma dsrc methods obtained based on the data in the calibration period in the bma model the xaj model was assigned to lower weight than the hbv and vhy model a similar trend can be observed in the bma dsrc model the weight distribution showed that the hbv and vhy model yielded slightly better performance than the xaj model in this case study in the dsrc bma model the weights of xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc were relatively close overall the weights were between 0 31 and 0 35 indicating that the three members involved had equal proportions in bma applications fig 7 described the uncertainty bands of bma dsrc bma and bma dsrc methods with the 90 confidence interval the performance of the confidence interval was evaluated by coverage ratio cr average relative bandwidth rb and average relative deviation amplitude rd as listed in table 5 the cr is the ratio of the number of observations that falls in the confidence interval to the number of total observations fig 7 showed that most of the observed data points were within the 90 confidence interval of the bma model with a cr of 86 58 although the interval width of the bma model was generally narrow some of the high and medium flow observations were outside of the interval especially for the years 2012 to 2015 compared to the bma model the dsrc bma and bma dsrc models had higher cr values of 98 19 and 95 28 respectively however in terms of rb both the dsrc bma model and bma dsrc model had higher values than the bma model this may be because the dsrc bma model and bma dsrc model simulated medium and high flows better the variance of the simulated values increased and therefore the relative bandwidths were expanded to varying degrees moreover the bma dsrc model exhibited the lowest rd compared to the rest two bma based models as a whole the bma dsrc model yielded a high cr and low rb and rd indicating that it can reflect most of the observed information in a relatively narrow uncertainty band therefore the bma dsrc model seems to be the robust and the most effective of the three models 5 conclusions hydrological modeling is an important tool in flood mitigation and water resources management worldwide so using the error correction methods to improve the accuracy of streamflow modeling is an operational priority the dsrc method is simple effective and based on the physical mechanism of flow concentration it can improve modeling accuracy without increasing model parameters and has been widely used in hydrological modeling however when the dsrc method is applied to correct the input rainfall series it regards the rainfall as the main source of error in streamflow calculation actually there are still other sources of error in hydrological modeling such as errors in the model structure hence the corrected rainfall series generated from different hydrological models by dsrc may vary slightly and it is hard to determine which corrected rainfall series is optimal therefore we developed two multi model integrated error correction methods based on dsrc and bma to enhance the accuracy of daily streamflow modeling namely dsrc bma and bma dsrc meanwhile the uncertainty of the proposed methods in daily streamflow simulation was assessed the developed methods and their benchmark models were tested in a real case study at the sunshui river catchment the main conclusions were summarized as follows 1 the xaj model hbv model and vhy model were implemented to daily streamflow modeling in the study area and showed acceptable accuracy results showed that the vhy had a better performance than the other two hydrological models moreover a standard bma method was used to merge the streamflow simulations from xaj hbv and vhy models but it presented a limited ability to improve the accuracy 2 compared to the bma method the dsrc based approaches including xaj dsrc hbv dsrc and vhy dsrc showed a significant improvement in model accuracy the vhy dsrc model decreased the rmse value of vhy model by approximately 50 from 18 8 m3 s to 9 5 m3 s the nse value of vhy model improved from 0 847 to 0 961 3 compared to the raw hydrological modeling the developed two multi model integrated error correction methods dsrc bma and bma dsrc can enhance the model performance to a certain extent the bma dsrc model provided the best results among the five error correction applications with the highest nse 0 985 and lowest rmse 5 9 m3 s but the dsrc bma model had a slightly worse performance than bma dsrc and vhy dsrc models 4 the uncertainty of bma dsrc bma and bma dsrc models were evaluated by three commonly used indicators cr rb and rd the results showed that the bma dsrc model yielded a high coverage ratio and low values in average relative bandwidth and average relative deviation amplitude so the bma dsrc method is effective and robust in daily streamflow modeling future work will explore the benefits of the improved method in more general applications such as using other variables for error correction coupling with other environmental models in addition the error of different sources needs to be further analyzed in the future

3552,the accuracy of hydrologic and hydrodynamic models used to study urban hydrology and predict urban flooding depends on the availability of high resolution terrain and infrastructure data unfortunately cities often do not have or cannot release complete infrastructure data and high resolution terrain data products are not available everywhere in this study we quantify how the accuracy and precision of urban hydrologic hydrodynamic models vary as a function of data completeness and model resolution for this aim we apply the one dimensional 1d and coupled one and two dimensional 1d 2d versions of the u s environmental protection agency s storm water management model swmm in an urban catchment in the city of phoenix arizona here we have collected detailed infrastructure data a high resolution 0 3 m lidar based digital elevation model and catchment properties data we tested several model configurations assuming different levels of i availability of stormwater infrastructure data ranging from 5 to 75 of attribute values missing and ii terrain aggregation i e 4 6 m and 9 7 m these configurations were generated through random monte carlo sampling for swmm 1d and selective sampling with four cases for swmm 1d 2d we ran simulations under the 50 year return period design storm and compared simulated flood metrics assuming the highest resolution and complete data model configuration as a reference the study found that the model may over or underestimate flood volume and duration with different levels of missing data depending on the parameters roughness diameter or depth and that model performance is more sensitive to missing data that is downstream and closer to the outfall as opposed to missing data upstream errors in flood depth area and volume estimation are functions of both the data completeness and model resolution missing feature data leads to overestimation of flood depth while lower model resolution results in underestimating flood depth and overestimating flood extent and volume keywords urban flood urban stormwater hydrodynamic modeling swmm urban infrastructure sampling algorithm 1 introduction urban flooding is a natural hazard impacting public health environmental quality and the economy rahmati et al 2020 although the national level economic and social costs of urban flooding in the u s are not routinely recorded past flood events have resulted in significant property damage and casualties the national academy press 2019 university of maryland and texas a m university 2018 for example urban flooding in cook county illinois resulted in flood losses at a cost of 660 million between 2007 and 2011 festing et al 2014 additionally a 1000 year rainfall event in ellicott city maryland in may 2018 caused over one billion dollars in damages and heavy rainfall in the metropolitan detroit area in august 2014 resulted in over 1 8 billion in damages university of maryland and texas a m university 2018 damages of urban flooding have been also documented outside of u s including in copenhagen denmark in july 2011 catania italy in october 2018 prokić et al 2019 chennai india in november and december 2015 nithila devi et al 2019 ho chi minh vietnam in november 2018 leitold et al 2021 beijing china in july 2012 jiang et al 2018 and nagoya city japan in autumn 2020 tanaka et al 2020 unfortunately the risk of urban flooding will likely increase worldwide because of intense urbanization and climate change urban growth results in a conversion of natural land into impervious areas which in turn increases runoff and reduces infiltration if proper drainage systems are not put in place global warming will likely lead to more intense and frequent extreme precipitation farris et al 2021 jung et al 2011 moftakhari et al 2015 wehner et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 climate projections for the u s estimate that the intensity of the heaviest 1 of precipitation events will likely rise across most regions under both intermediate and worst case climate change scenarios of representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 with the highest projected increase of 40 by 2100 compared to 1986 2015 under rcp 8 5 in midwest and northeast the national academy press 2019 one of the major flood generating mechanisms in cities is pluvial flooding which occurs when the precipitation intensity exceeds infiltration rate and drainage capacity rosenzweig et al 2018 pluvial flooding is particularly impactful in urban areas because of the lower threshold for runoff generation and the shorter time of concentration this flood mechanism has received less attention compared to fluvial or coastal flooding rosenzweig et al 2018 for example the federal emergency management agency s fema s flood hazard analysis and mapping focus only on riverine and coastal flooding the national academy press 2019 in a study by the first street foundation 2020 which included pluvial flooding among other flooding mechanisms the number of properties across the u s with substantial flood risk defined as inundation 1 cm during 1 in 100 year flood was found to be 1 7 times fema s estimate confirming the importance of pluvial flooding in the u k it has been estimated that damages from urban pluvial flooding in 2008 exceeded 0 36 billion which is a lower cost than the 0 8 2 8 billion calculated for fluvial and coastal flooding however future projections indicate that losses due to urban flooding will become similar to or higher than those of other flooding types by 2080 dawson et al 2008 hall et al 2005 the simulation of pluvial flooding requires capturing a range of hydrologic and hydraulic processes including rainfall runoff transformation overland flow routing and pipe flows for this aim hydrologic models with different levels of sophistication have been coupled to hydraulic models simulating water flow in the drainage networks and on the land surface guo et al 2020 leandro et al 2009 noh et al 2018 seyoum et al 2012 vojinovic and tutulic 2009 a key requirement to increase the predictive skill of these coupled hydrologic hydraulic models is to incorporate small scale heterogeneities of terrain and stormwater infrastructure into the simulations fewtrell et al 2008 gallegos et al 2009 this is because the impacts of pluvial flooding vary significantly at small spatial scales for example six inches of moving floodwater can knock down a pedestrian and cause vehicles to loose traction national weather service nws n d in urban areas where topography is highly heterogeneous such changes in elevation can happen over short distances while recent advances have been made towards model improvement and coupling cantone and schmidt 2011 chang et al 2015 henonin et al 2013 leandro and martins 2016 nanía et al 2015 wu et al 2018 the sources of errors in simulations of urban flooding have not yet been fully explored because of uncertainty and limited availability of geospatial data terrain soil land cover and infrastructure and high resolution precipitation forcing required to setup and run the simulations of particular importance to increase accuracy of pluvial flooding prediction is the integration of infrastructure and high resolution terrain data association of state floodplain managers asfpm 2020 infrastructure data includes all components of built stormwater systems such as catch basins manholes conduits detention and storage basins drywells and outfalls whereas terrain data includes urban features such as buildings street curbs overpasses and bridges unfortunately these datasets are often incomplete or of poor quality and data collection efforts are resource intensive important characteristics of such spatial data quality are completeness accuracy consistency and current ness fox et al 1994 veregin 1999 data completeness as defined by fox et al 1994 is the degree to which a data collection has values for all the attributes of all the features guptill and morrison 1995 and veregin 1999 further characterize data completeness as feature completeness attribute completeness and value completeness for example in a stormwater database features include components like conduits catch basins and manholes each feature has attributes such as material or diameter for conduits and attributes have numerical or categorical values in a complete stormwater database all the system components as features and its attributes and values are present model development is also challenged by the limited availability of high resolution spatial data e g 1 m digital elevation models or dems and the need to balance computational cost with accuracy requirements the resolutions of commonly available dems e g 10 m in u s united states geological survey usgs n d do not sufficiently capture fine details of urban infrastructure features such as walls curbs steps and storm drains thus preventing the simulation of overland flow in complex urban environments fewtrell et al 2008 krebs et al 2014 leitão et al 2016 sampson et al 2012 past studies have cautioned that the ideal spatial resolution is between 2 and 5 m for the effective representation of urban features arrighi and campo 2019 dottori et al 2013 the advent of airborne light detection and ranging lidar has increased the availability of high resolution less than 1 m topographic data that would allow incorporating small scale heterogeneities found in urban basins into hydrologic models bates et al 2003 bermúdez and zischg 2018 fewtrell et al 2011 noh et al 2018 sampson et al 2012 despite this promising capability lidar products are available at limited sites are expensive to acquire and require significant computational resources to be processed and used in numerical models more insight is then needed to weigh costs and benefits of investment in lidar for urban flood modeling previous studies have evaluated the impacts of simplifying the model representation of certain elements krebs et al 2014 and prior research demonstrates that select aggregation may have limited impacts on model results for example elliot et al 2009 assessed different aggregations of detention tanks and bioretention as well as their associated catchment areas finding that there is little effect on predictions of mean flow baseflow and water quality at the outlet however while aggregation of stormwater control features allows modeling water balance or outflow hydrograph at a lower computational cost this approach provides limited information on location duration and extent of the flood which is crucial when modeling the impacts of pluvial flooding thus additional research is needed to assess the feasibility of aggregation for spatially distributed street flooding estimation as hydrologic hydraulic models for urban flood modeling are critical to flood prediction infrastructure design and adaptation planning it is crucial to also understand the impact of different sources of error and uncertainty pathak et al 2015 for engineers and planners developing asset management plans harvey et al 2017 designing flood mitigation infrastructure kabisch et al 2017 kuriqi and hysa 2021 or rehabilitating drainage structures martínez et al 2018 accurate hydraulic information of the drainage system as well as communication of output uncertainty is vital several past studies on different catchment scales focused on 1 quantifying the rainfall error uncertainty on hydrologic model outputs arising from temporal resolution lyu et al 2018 data products such as satellite rainfall bitew and gebremichael 2011 or radar rainfall error propagation hjelmstad et al 2021 sharif et al 2002 2 quantifying effect of dem resolution on urban flood modeling leitão et al 2009 leitão and de sousa 2018 however little is known about modeling errors arising from missing infrastructure data e g missing features or components or properties of these features e g missing attributes and standard approaches on how to deal with data gaps are nonexistent further the effect of dem and model resolution in conjugation with completeness of infrastructure features in coupled 1d 2d model is not fully understood or quantified this study aims at addressing two research questions motivated by the challenges in pluvial urban flood modeling described above including 1 how do the proportion and spatial distribution of infrastructure data gaps impact model performance and 2 how does the spatial resolution of the terrain data interact with infrastructure data gaps to impact the model performance model performance is defined as accuracy and precision in modeling flood flow rate volume duration and extent to examine these research questions we simulated pluvial flooding in an urban catchment in the city of phoenix arizona using a semi distributed coupled hydrological hydraulic model based on the u s environmental protection agency s epa storm water management model we first explored the effect of missing data i e attribute value of parameters using the one dimensional rainfall runoff and pipe flow model swmm 1d we then examined the combined effect of model resolution i e high and low model resolution and data completeness i e missing stormwater features using the coupled 1d 2d model version swmm 1d 2d in sum our objectives are to assess model error bias and uncertainty arising from missing infrastructure attribute data and to investigate the combined effect of infrastructure feature data gaps and coarsening model resolution 2 study area data collection and processing to answer our research questions we focus on an urban catchment in the city of phoenix arizona since the city faces periodic pluvial floods and the required infrastructure data are complete and accessible fig 1 a phoenix is the capital of the state and the main city of one of the largest metropolitan regions in the u s with a population of approximately 4 5 million people it is in central arizona and the northeastern sonoran desert downstream of the confluence between the salt and verde rivers according to the köppen classification the climate is hot desert or arid bwh with extreme hot summers and mild short winters the average yearly precipitation is 204 mm while the mean temperature is 24 c mascaro 2017 climate is characterized by two main seasons that influence the rainfall regime the first includes a summer period from july to september that is dominated by the north american monsoon when convective activity leads to diurnally modulated localized thunderstorms with short durations less than 1h and high rain intensity balling and brazel 1986 the second season which ranges from late october through march is dry and occasionally interrupted by cold fronts causing widespread storm systems with low to moderate rainfall intensity and relatively longer durations of up to a few days sheppard et al 2002 monsoonal thunderstorms cause severe flash flood events in the region though other storm types can also trigger flooding for example in september 2014 the remnants of hurricane norbert triggered pluvial flooding inundating major roadways throughout the valley nws 2014 in central arizona the spatial variability of annual seasonal and extreme rainfall is moderately to significantly controlled by terrain which varies from 220 to 2 325 m above mean sea level msl mascaro 2020 2018 2017 the topography of phoenix is generally flat the urban form is characterized by a street pattern running in precise grids and such is the stormwater infrastructure layout our study catchment has a total area of 2 4 km2 the catchment runoff drains to the south of the main outfall into the salt river fig 1b the soil type distribution in the study catchment is presented in table s1 the weighted average imperviousness relative to the discretized sub catchments area is 71 24 while maximum is 99 table s2 the

data obtained from the noted source fig 2 shows the layers of spatial data required to build swmm 1d 2d models swmm 1d model also utilizes the same layers without terrain data layers namely building and mesh grids stormwater infrastructure data with complete features and attribute values is critical to build the hydrologic hydraulic model and simulate catchment behavior the geodatabase for the infrastructure components in phoenix is stored and updated at irregular intervals by the phoenix public works department we obtained the infrastructure data which is not publicly available from the public works department in 2019 to ensure that there are no missing data or inconsistencies in the gis database we verified through field visits that surface infrastructure features were properly located the stormwater infrastructure data for the study catchment includes 430 catch basins to collect stormwater runoff 613 manholes and other nodes which connect upstream and downstream conduits 1 091 conduits with attributes of material year built depth slope shape and size 26 drywells which infiltrate stormwater and are usually present in flat topography and 1 major outfall where stormwater drains to the salt river the details of stormwater components in our study catchment are shown in figs 1b and 2a following the definition of data completeness by guptill and morrison 1995 and veregin 1999 in this study we characterize data completeness as feature completeness which refers to the known presence and location of all stormwater infrastructure components and attribute value completeness which refers to known attributes and values of each component accuracy can also be assessed for both features and attribute values feature accuracy refers to whether the feature type and location are correct while attribute value accuracy refers to whether infrastructure attributes e g diameter are correct this study uses the single most current and thus consistent infrastructure dataset therefore this analysis does not focus on data consistency nor current ness here we assume that our field verified infrastructure data set is both complete and accurate we then refer to this infrastructure dataset as the ground truth and the corresponding model built as the ground truth model point cloud lidar data were available as a terrain data with 0 3 m spacing for the city of phoenix asu 2018 only the point cloud data with return points excluding buildings and vegetations were selected using the las filter and create las dataset geoprocessing tool in arcgis pro to create a ground based dem fig 2b that includes the details of street level and curbs since the use of the 0 3 m resolution dem is computationally too intensive for 2d overland flow computations a 4 6 m resolution dem was also generated to create the 2d model fig 2c in addition to the dems we created a 0 3 m digital surface model dsm that includes buildings fig 2d but not trees as trees do not impede water flow throughout their full canopy area in order to delineate the watershed the buildings act as an impermeable obstruction layer in swmm 1d 2d model data on the catchment soil types and properties e g suction head saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 2e were obtained from the arizona department of transportation adot 2014 urban imperviousness data from 2016 with a resolution of 30 m was used as seen in fig 2f mrlc n d the time series of design storm for a 1 50 annual exceedance probability with 45 min duration and 5 min intervals was created from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 point precipitation frequency estimates noaa nws n d using an alternating block method chow et al 1998 this study primarily focuses on extreme flood estimation rather than infrastructure design thus a higher return period was chosen this design storm was used as the input for all simulations we selected a storm duration of 45 min equivalent to the time of concentration for the catchment 3 methodology in the following sections we describe the development of the semi distributed hydrologic hydraulic model using 1d and coupled 1d 2d approaches we then present the algorithm to fill attribute value data gaps and the monte carlo sampling approach for attribute value completeness lastly we describe the selective sampling approach to assess the combined effect of feature completeness and model resolution 3 1 hydrologic hydraulic model we used the u s epa s swmm version 5 1 1d model and computational hydraulics international chi s pcswmm version 7 3 3095 coupled 1d 2d model to execute the model and facilitate monte carlo sampling we used the r package swmmr version 0 9 1 leutnant et al 2019 swmm is a hydrologic hydraulic modeling tool that simulates rainfall runoff and routing processes for single precipitation events or in a continuous fashion in urban or rural catchments it estimates two main processes i runoff which is computed on a collection of discretized sub catchments that generate runoff and pollutants due to precipitation and ii routing which is the transport of runoff across an underground network of conduits overland channels and other components swmm is a semi distributed model and it accounts for various hydrologic processes such as time varying rainfall evaporation from standing water rainfall interception in depression storage infiltration into unsaturated soil layers percolation into groundwater layers interflow between groundwater and the drainage system non linear reservoir routing of overland flow and stormwater capture by low impact development the details about theoretical background equations variables features and capabilities of swmm can be found in rossman 2017 and james et al 2010 in this study we apply two implementations of swmm 1 a one dimensional drainage model swmm 1d and 2 a coupled 1d 2d model swmm 1d 2d that adds two dimensional routing of overland flow of floodwaters we used swmm 1d to test the effect of infrastructure data attribute value completeness the 1d model was chosen for its faster computation time compared to the coupled 1d 2d model and the ability to execute the model from the source code which enables monte carlo sampling swmm 1d 2d was used to assess the combined effects of data feature completeness and model resolution in practice a large spatial infrastructure data set is rarely 100 percent complete due to manual data entry error compilation error and antiquated data as new construction or rehabilitation takes place however for this study we assume that the data we acquired from the phoenix public works department and verified by walk through surveys are 100 percent complete and accurate we define this data as the ground truth where all the required features and attribute values are complete and accurate the ground truth model built from this data and the highest feasible resolution of dem serves as the basis for comparing simulations described in the next section the hydrologic component of swmm simulates the rainfall runoff transformation after accounting for losses through a non linear reservoir model where the reservoir capacity is maximum depression storage in this model the study area catchment is discretized into sub catchments to reflect the spatial heterogeneity in topography drainage pathway land cover and soil characteristics that impact rainfall runoff we utilized the 0 3 m dsm consisting of street profiles buildings and general topography to delineate the watershed and discretize it into smaller sub catchments with an average area of 2 428 m2 using the watershed delineation tools of pcswmm the hydrologic model input is precipitation and the output from each sub catchment are surface runoff and losses due to infiltration and evaporation surface runoff is defined as the excess volume above the depression storage which considers the initial abstraction such as surface ponding interception by flat roofs vegetation and surface wetting which eventually evaporates or infiltrates following the storm depression storages of 1 25 mm for impervious surfaces and 2 5 mm for pervious surfaces as suggested by the american society of civil engineers 1992 were assigned for each sub catchment to calculate losses due to infiltration we selected the green ampt infiltration model implemented in swmm with parameters derived from soil types adot 2014 which are presented in table s1 here discrete event simulation for the 50 year return period 45 min design storm for downtown phoenix noaa nws n d is applied to force all of the models we assumed a constant evaporation rate of 0 76 cm day western regional climate center wrcc n d corresponding to the average during monsoon season the parameters used for the stormwater system are summarized in table s3 the governing equations and additional details for the hydrologic processes as employed in the swmm can be found in rossman 2017 and james et al 2010 the hydraulic component of swmm uses the dynamic wave routine that solves unsteady flow through the network of conduits and nodes using the conservation of mass and momentum equations dynamic wave routing solves the complete one dimensional saint venant flow equations whose details can be found in rossman 2006 which account for channel storage backwater effects entrance exit losses and pressurized flow flooding in the system occurs when the hydraulic grade line at a node exceeds the threshold of available depth i e rim elevation the flooded water in swmm 1d is accounted as flooding losses which will not re enter the drainage network unless ponding is allowed the surcharge depth for manholes was assigned as 0 4 m which is equivalent to the resistance of manhole lid cover weight the parameters for the sub catchments and infrastructure are extracted directly from the attribute values in the infrastructure database soil data or dem these parameters include rim elevation invert elevation and depth for catch basin and manholes junctions or nodes roughness length diameter cross section and slope for conduits invert elevation for outfalls and drywells nodes and area slope imperviousness and green ampt parameters for sub catchments the relevant outputs from the hydraulic component include 1 time series of flooding and flow at all nodes and conduits respectively 2 flood loss time series i e flow exiting the drainage system when the hydraulic grade line reaches the surface at all nodes and in aggregate hereafter referred to as system flooding and 3 duration of flooding and surcharge at all nodes the duration of node flooding is the length of time when the hydraulic grade line is above the rim elevation for a particular node to maintain numerical stability and remove continuity error a time step of 1 s was selected for both swmm 1d and 1d 2d models for 1d 2d coupled modeling we used pcswmm due to its additional capability to simulate overland flood routing and associated flood extent depth and duration in two dimensions this model extends the fully dynamic 1d approach in epa s swmm5 to 2d free surface flow using a non uniform mesh that captures the topography geometry and built structures swmm 2d domain solves swmm5 dynamic wave routing with or without inertial terms ignoring inertial terms creates diffusive wave routing which is virtually indistinguishable from full term dynamic wave solution finney et al 2012 james et al 2013 in the 2d domain the overland surface is discretized into a square mesh and represents each 2d cell with a 2d node or a junction where invert elevation for these nodes is assigned the ground surface elevation or rim elevation of adjacent coupled 1d nodes finney et al 2012 james et al 2013 in the 2d domain of 1d 2d coupled model grid cells require slope and roughness parameters swmm 1d 2d uses the same sub catchment delineation and catchment properties as well as hydraulic network and hydrologic properties as described above for swmm 1d the catch basin nodes are coupled with 2d mesh cells using orifices in 1d 2d integrated model such that the volume of water exiting an orifice when flooding occurs is routed over the 2d mesh cells this excess flow can pond on the overland grid cells and re enter the drainage network when the hydraulic grade subsides below ground elevation 3 2 random sampling of infrastructure data first we tested the significance of infrastructure data completeness on the model a one at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the important infrastructure parameters using a built in tool available in pcswmm finney and gharabaghi 2011 sensitivity analysis assesses the rate of change in response of the model with respect to changes in the model input parameter and the relative importance of parameters to have more accurate values as measured by the sensitivity gradients james 2003 details of sensitivity analysis are presented in section s3 of the supplementary material we selected five infrastructure related parameters from stormwater components conduit diameter node depth i e maximum distance from invert elevation to rim elevation conduit roughness inlet offset i e the distance from a conduit s inlet end to the connected node invert elevation and outlet offset i e the distance from a conduit s outlet end to the connected node invert elevation all parameters are sampled uniformly within lower to higher parameter values given by an uncertainty level of 50 as described in section s3 out of the five parameters tested we found that the three most sensitive parameters are conduit roughness conduit diameter and node depth hereafter referred to as roughness diameter and depth as shown in table 2 where larger absolute values of the sensitivity gradient indicates more sensitive parameters to test the impact of missing attribute value data on the model we developed an algorithm to randomly sample conduits and nodes remove values of roughness diameter and depth in these selected features and estimate these missing attribute values using the remaining data and design standards the algorithm enables us to test many combinations of missing attribute values using monte carlo sampling the replacement component of the algorithm is essential as a swmm model cannot be run without specifying all parameter values the replacement criteria for missing attribute value is implemented in accordance with the available design standards and modeling practice the detailed process algorithm is described below and the overall method for random sampling is illustrated in fig 3 the algorithm to sample roughness diameter and depth illustrated in fig 3 develops and runs a new swmm 1d model for each iteration n 100 times by randomly removing a specified percentage of each of the three parameters identified above then filling these gaps based on the remaining information available the process can be summarized into three main steps 1 randomly select the number of conduits and nodes corresponding with the percent of missing attribute values specified i e m number of features to be sampled per parameter for the selected sample delete existing roughness diameter or depth 2 replace deleted attribute values with an informed estimate the estimation algorithm is specific to the parameter a roughness identify the upstream pipe and apply its roughness if the upstream roughness attribute is missing then use the downstream roughness if both upstream and downstream roughness are missing randomly sample an empirical distribution function edf of roughness from available information i e conduits with known roughness the empirical distribution of roughness in the ground truth model is presented in fig s2 of the supplementary material section s5 b diameter identify the upstream pipe and apply its diameter if the upstream diameter attribute is missing then use the downstream diameter if both upstream and downstream diameters are missing then use the mean diameter of all conduits in the dataset with known diameters c depth identify the upstream node and apply its depth if upstream depth is missing then use the depth of downstream feature if both upstream and downstream depths are missing assume a minimum cover of 0 91 m as per the arizona drainage design manual adot 2014 the node depth information is shared by both connected node or junction and conduits note that there are a few conduits with 0 slope in the ground truth and randomly sampled models particularly for shorter length conduits but the overall slope is positive in addition elevation of the street surface and the rim elevations gradually slope downward from upstream to downstream nodes thus in this particular catchment the negative slopes are avoided when sampling depth 3 run swmm 1d and extract the time series of system flooding and duration of flooding if present at each node model accuracy is defined relative to the ground truth model output and is quantified by the mean absolute error mae and percent bias pbias the mae and pbias for system flooding sf in subscript are defined as 1 mae sf 1 n j 1 n 1 t t 1 t y t j x t 2 pbia s sf 1 n j 1 n t 1 t y t j x t t 1 t x t where yt j is the simulated flow at each time steps t t 1 t for the j th j 1 n iterations where n 100 and x t is the value simulated by the ground truth model both maesf and pbiassf were first computed as the comparison of hydrographs obtained from sampled and ground truth models and then averaged across all 100 iterations for the duration of node flooding mae and pbias fd in subscript were computed from the mean and maximum durations of node flooding in 100 iterations compared to the ground truth which is defined as 3 ma e fd j 1 n y j x j n 4 pbias fd j 1 n y j x j j 1 n x j 100 where y j is mean or maximum duration of node flooding for each j 1 to nth iteration where n 100 x j is the mean or maximum duration of node flooding in the ground truth model model uncertainty describes the degree of variation in model output across sampled simulations and is quantified by the relative interquartile range riqr which is defined as 5 riqr q 0 75 q 0 25 q 0 5 100 where q 0 75 q 0 25 and q 0 5 represent upper quartile lower quartile and median respectively for the empirical distributions of either maximum system flooding i e peak flow or duration of flooding averaged or maximum across all nodes precision is referred to as the inverse of uncertainty the significance of missing data was tested in terms of the level and location of missing data for different levels of missing data 5 25 50 and 75 the number of features sampled m is the corresponding percentage of missing data multiplied by the total number of relevant features i e conduits or nodes then to assess the impact of the location of missing data we assumed that 50 of data is missing and divided the catchment into two regions the upstream and downstream the 50 missing data level was selected because as shown later in the results model error increased consistently across parameters with increasing missing data until 50 when sampling the full catchment beyond 50 the pattern was mixed the upstream and downstream features were identified by conditional selection of features that are above or below the median distance from the main outfall for the upstream or downstream region respectively to test the influence of the location of missing data the random sampling method described above with the same n 100 iterations was repeated with the removed attribute values limited to the upstream and then downstream regions of the network for random sampling only the swmm 1d model was used since the computation time of swmm 1d 2d is too long to perform many runs the swmm 1d 2d model was reserved for selective sampling as described next 3 3 selective sampling we applied selective sampling of swmm 1d 2d models to assess the impact of different combinations of feature data completeness and model resolution on model performance model resolution for the semi distributed model is defined in terms of the resolutions of the 2d mesh grid and the dem utilized to create such a grid four selective sampling models were created table 3 in the low resolution models hdlm and ldlm slopes for the discretized sub catchments were assigned from the coarser resolution 9 7 m dem to account for the fact that high resolution terrain could not be available in all places and that the most commonly available dem resolution from usgs is 1 3rd arc second 10 m although two of the selective sampling models ldlm and ldhm have missing features or incomplete infrastructure data the attribute values for all remaining features are the same as the ground truth the selective sampling results were compared in terms of flood depth volume and extent flood depth refers to the maximum water level observed in the 2d mesh cells at the time of peak flooding flood volume refers to the sum of all flooding fluxes from 1d nodes to 2d grid cells through orifices integrated over the whole flood period flood extent refers to the sum of the areas of 2d mesh cells with floodwater 0 mm at the time of peak flooding 4 results and discussion this section first presents simulation results from monte carlo sampling of swmm 1d model recounting the effects of different levels and locations of incomplete data on modeled peak flood flow and duration then we present swmm 1d 2d modeling results for four selective sampling models characterized by combinations of complete or incomplete infrastructure data and high or low model resolution particularly focusing on flood depth extent and volume 4 1 evaluation of random sampling the impacts of missing attribute values for the three selected model parameters on the simulated flooding conditions and metrics are summarized in figs 4 and 5 specifically fig 4 shows the distribution of simulated flood duration at all nodes for the three sampled parameters in 100 monte carlo sampling and the ground truth model at different percentages of missing attribute values fig 5 presents boxplots of 100 monte carlo sampling for maximum system flooding fig 5a c maximum flooding duration fig 5d f and average flooding duration fig 5g i as a function of percent of missing data hereafter pmd table 4 reports error and uncertainty metrics as defined in section 3 2 for the clarity of exposition these figures and table are discussed in the following three sub sections focusing separately on sampling roughness diameter and depth finally in the last subsection we illustrate the effect of missing attribute values at upstream and downstream portions of the basin for pmd 50 for the three parameters 4 1 1 effect of roughness we begin by discussing fig 4 where the distribution of flood duration simulated by the ground truth model is displayed by a red curve whereas the ensemble simulations of 100 iterations for different levels of missing data are shown by grey curves the ground truth model predicts that 564 nodes will be flooded for a varied duration from 0 01 to 1 03 hr or an overall average duration of 0 21 hr the density plot for ground truth fig 4 shows the number of flooded nodes decreases rapidly for durations up to 0 2 hr rises slightly until 0 5 hr and then decreases at a lower rate up to about 1 hr when only 5 of the roughness data are missing the ground truth distribution is well captured across the simulations fig 4a however as pmd increases fig 4b d the monte carlo runs simulate slightly higher number of nodes that are flooded for 0 01 hr and slight increase in uncertainty observed between 0 1 and 0 5 hr fig 5a d g and table 4 show that errors bias and uncertainty of the simulated flood metrics increase only slightly as pmd of roughness increases bias and uncertainty are low but increase for higher pmd as seen in the peak flooding flow rate maximum pbias of 0 45 max riqr of 0 27 maximum duration maximum pbias of 1 max riqr of 2 94 and average duration maximum pbias of 1 2 max riqr of 1 53 in other words when the data available on pipe roughness decreases our algorithm designed to replace missing data results in low error bias and uncertainty this is explained in part by algorithm skill and in part by the fact that in the ground truth data the majority 90 of the conduits are concrete including reinforced concrete and rubber gasket reinforced concrete pipe all of which have an average roughness of 0 015 sec m1 3 as presented in the fig s2 of the supplementary material given the shape of this empirical distribution the probability of sampling the incorrect roughness is low acknowledging that other locations will present a greater challenge for sampling roughness we investigated how the pmd for roughness would affect the model outputs if the distribution was not dominated by a single conduit material for this we created a hypothetical set of conduits using the same model and holding other parameters constant where distribution of materials is 12 concrete 51 corrugated metal pipe and 37 smooth plastic hdpe or pvc this distribution is valid per the drainage design standards city of phoenix 2013 see section s5 for details in this hypothetical conduit distribution we found that error bias and uncertainty are higher but remain moderate at 50 pmd or lower pbias less than 5 riqr less than 10 figs s3 s4 and table s4 the error associated with different pmd of roughness could be reduced with information on the relationship between pipe age size and material if available 4 1 2 effect of diameter the effect of increasing the diameter pmd on the simulated distribution of flood duration is fig 4e h 1 lower higher number of nodes for durations between 0 01 and 0 3 hr 0 6 and 0 9 hr 2 equal likelihood of simulating higher or lower number of nodes flooded between 0 3 and 0 5 hr however the uncertainty does not increase consistently with pmd the boxplots of the three flood metrics related to missing diameter data exhibit a nonlinear behavior fig 5b e h the peak system flooding and mean flood duration are overestimated while maximum flood duration is underestimated this is because the maximum flood duration tends to occur at the peripheral nodes connected to 0 3 m diameter pipes in the network where sub catchment runoff drains into the network whose downstream conduit s diameter are usually 0 3 m thus the current sampling algorithm underestimates peripheral node surcharge and flooding and the majority of monte carlo simulations underestimate maximum flood duration for all metrics the largest mae is obtained for pmd 50 the largest pbias for peak system flooding and mean flood duration is also obtained for pmd 50 the largest uncertainty for peak system flooding is obtained for pmd 25 for maximum flood duration is obtained for pmd 5 but for mean flood duration is obtained for pmd 75 while uncertainty range is similar for pmd 5 to 25 table 4 when sampling from pmd 5 to 50 error increased for all metrics but uncertainty decreased for peak system flooding and maximum flood duration or remained stable for mean flood duration at pmd 75 sampling results showed slight improvement in accuracy as shown by mae and observed in fig 5b e h these outcomes are a consequence of the algorithm adopted to replace missing diameter data as pmd rises there are more chances that missing diameters are assigned the average diameter of the stormwater system see fig 3 so that several peripheral pipes trunk pipes in the network are oversized undersized in the ground truth model 68 7 of conduits are circular 0 3 m pipes but the average is 0 46 m the average and median diameter are similar in this case and both result in the selection of the same standard conduit size 0 46 m or 18 in overestimating small pipes reduces the risk of stormwater capacity constraints and surcharge in the periphery of the network which explains decrease in maximum system flooding and duration of flooding in contrast underestimating large pipes leads to increased probability of surcharge along the main conduit which can also lead to surcharge in upstream peripheral conduits it is also important to note that maximum flooding duration does not signify maximum flood flow rate or volume just the longest duration 4 1 3 effect of depth the effect of missing depth on the simulated distribution of flood duration is that when pmd 5 the model simulated more flooded nodes between 0 01 and 0 1 hr but lower between 0 2 and 0 5 hr fig 4i while at pmd 25 the model is equally likely to simulate higher or lower number of nodes that will be flooding between 0 01 and 0 1 hr while it mostly simulates lower number of nodes flooded between 0 2 and 0 7 hr fig 4j when pmd 50 or 75 the model simulates lower number of nodes flooded between 0 01 and 0 1 hr it is equally likely to simulate higher or lower number of nodes flooded between 0 1 and 0 5 hr but more likely the model simulates higher number of nodes flooded between 0 5 and 0 9 hr fig 4k l error in estimating peak system flooding and average duration of nodes flooding as shown by mae and pbias increases monotonically with increasing pmd with the largest error occurring at pmd 75 fig 5c i lowest precision or highest uncertainty occurs at different pmd for different metrics table 4 there was an increase in precision for estimating peak system flooding when pmd increased to 75 from 50 and for estimating maximum flood duration when pmd increased to 50 from 25 table 4 and fig 5 c f at pmd 5 the model response does not significantly change in terms of peak system flooding fig 5c or maximum duration of nodes flooded fig 5f except the outliers for highest duration of nodes flooded are from few significant nodes being assigned average depth whose upstream and downstream depth are missing as pmd increased from 50 to 75 for the peak system flooding and from 25 to 75 for maximum duration of node flooding the model accuracy didn t change much as shown by mae and pbias table 4 the model simulates lower mean duration of nodes flooded when pmd is 5 or 25 and higher when pmd is 50 or 75 fig 5i this is because when pmd is 5 or 25 it is more likely that upstream or downstream depth is present which either increases the depth or creates uniform slopes thus improving the capacity of the network causing less surcharge in contrast when pmd is 50 or 75 it is more likely that both the upstream and downstream depth are missing thus minimum depths are assigned creating non homogenous depth thus modelers should be cautious in estimating missing depth in sum this analysis demonstrates how the missing infrastructure attribute values affects estimation of pluvial flooding under reasonable assumptions for filling missing roughness diameter and depth based on available information and design standards as shown in fig 3 while estimation could be improved by carefully examining each instance of missing data individually this is often not feasible due to resource constraints this estimation method can quickly estimate many missing attribute values and the specific algorithms can be adjusted to fit local design standards and available information 4 1 4 effect of location of missing data we also examined how model performance is affected by the location of missing data by assuming pmd 50 either in the upstream or downstream portion of the network as described in the methodology fig 6 shows boxplots of flood metrics derived from n 100 monte carlo sampling while metrics values are reported in table 5 figure s5 and table s5 in the supplementary material section s5 shows the effect of missing roughness in hypothetical conduit distribution it is apparent that lack of information in the downstream section leads to higher error bias and uncertainty this means that when missing data is in the downstream region of the catchment the approximation to fill missing data that works for upstream attributes may be insufficient it also establishes the relative importance of a feature s distance from the outfall indicating that distance from the outfall might be an important input into a more sophisticated estimation algorithm monte carlo sampling for the three parameters showed varied degrees of relative importance out of the three attributes missing diameter had the most effect in downstream sampling as it could lead to the highest error in system flooding and average duration of nodes flooding missing diameter in the downstream section led to the lowest model precision as indicated by a riqr of 0 8 for system flooding and a riqr of 14 and 4 for maximum and mean duration of nodes flooding fig 6 and table 5 4 2 evaluation of selective sampling the following section describes the impact of model resolution and infrastructure feature completeness on modeled flood depth volume and extent four cases were modeled each containing either high 0 3 m dem and 4 6 m 2d mesh hm or low 9 7 m dem and 9 7 m 2d mesh lm resolution and either high complete information hd or low 50 of upstream features missing ld infrastructure data see table 3 to visualize differences across the domains changes in dem resolution resulted in changes in the slope of discretized catchments as shown in fig 7 it is notable that the slopes of low resolution models ldlm and hdlm are much flatter than high resolution models ldhm and hdhm which include details of street profile and curbs fig 7c this means that the heterogeneity of surface topography is well captured by high resolution models whereas low resolution models suffer a loss of terrain information fig 7a b fig 8 illustrates boxplots of maximum flood depth at each cell in the four sampling domains hdlm has a narrower distribution while ldhm has a wider distribution the distributions for all four models are positively skewed all interquartile ranges including maxima showed the similar pattern ldhm resulted in the highest maximum flood depth 0 48 m which is closest to the ground truth i e hdhm value of 0 45 m low resolution models ldlm and hdlm underestimated maximum flood depth compared to the ground truth at 0 3 m and 0 28 m respectively underestimation was most profound when the infrastructure data is complete but model resolution is coarse hdlm fig 9 illustrates the pluvial flooding fluxes in the four selective sampling models for all orifices that connect the coupled swmm 1d s node with swmm 2d s mesh grid cells the flooding flux is the aggregate of all spatially distributed flood fluxes occurring at each timestep all three tested model configurations overestimated the total flooding volume compared to the ground truth hdhm the overestimation of peak flooding flux was observed when there is incomplete data ldhm and ldlm this makes sense as features such as inlets and conduits that would otherwise collect and convey stormwater are absent from these models however in the high resolution model ldhm the exchange of flood water between overland flow and underground drainage was more efficient compared to ldlm thus compared with hdhm ldhm may have incomplete data but its higher resolution results in lower error than with ldlm in term of total flood volume the spatial flooding pattern of maximum grid cell flood depth for the four selective sampling models is shown in fig 10 the high flood depths occurred in hm models as highlighted in box i fig 10a d with the maximum occurring in ldhm fig 10d and the minimum occurred in hdlm fig 10b however large flood extent occurred in lm models as highlighted in box ii fig 10b c with the maximum occurring in hdlm as compared to other two hm models in the case of incomplete stormwater infrastructure data missing features particularly catch basins preclude a realistic estimate of localized flooding and result in overestimates of flood volume depth and extent for example as highlighted with box iii some of the areas flooded when infrastructure data is incomplete ldlm and ldhm fig 10c d remain dry when complete data is available hdhm and hdlm fig 10a b this is because in swmm 1d 2d overland flow drains to the underground drainage system through catch basins and can re enter the drainage system after surcharge condition recedes note that this is a key distinction between swmm 1d and swmm 1d 2d in swmm 1d 2d the exchange of flood water takes place between the surface and subsurface as the flux in flood volume changes whereas in swmm 1d the water leaving the catch basins is counted as flooding and cannot reenter the drainage system for this reason the maximum system flooding simulated in the ground truth swmm 1d model 89 6 m3 s is higher than in the two dimensional hdhm model 73 m3 s also due to the limitations of the general 1d 2d modeling approach as employed in this study where a larger portion of infrastructure data is missing such as an area highlighted in box iv ld models will not estimate surface flooding as all catchment areas must be linked to a catch basin model resolution also plays a role as overland flood water is more effective at re entering the drainage system in higher resolution models the maximum depth out of the four selective sampling models was observed in the high resolution models however the maximum flooded area and flood volume were observed in the low resolution models as local depressions are smoothed in the coarser dem and the flood water spreads more readily to surrounding grid cells fig 10 the error in flood depth area and volume is the function of both the data completeness and model resolution all surcharged flow spills onto the overland surface represented by the mesh grid and flows both on the surface in 2d and in through the pipe network in 1d in the high resolution models higher heterogeneity in elevation allows depressions to be better represented so that there are chances for the surface flow to re enter into the 1d components this results in lower pluvial flood volume compared to the low resolution models it is crucial for mesh grids in swmm 1d 2d to represent true topographic features at the scale of flooding hazards in order to model the physical process accurately the use of 9 7 m dem and 9 7 m mesh grids underestimates heterogeneity in surface elevation and topographic features relevant to pedestrian and vehicle flood hazards fig 11 summarizes the hydrological and hydraulic output for each scenario in terms of hydrology when the model resolution was coarse infiltration and evaporation were slightly overestimated and runoff was underestimated due to the flatter slopes and loss of terrain detail fig 11 in term of hydraulics in the 1d component of swmm 1d 2d the relative comparison of the total surcharged nodes showed higher number of nodes are surcharged in lower resolution model this is because the rim elevation for nodes in hm and lm models are extracted from 0 3 m dem with heterogeneous slope and 9 7 m dem with flatter slope our results agree with prior work by ozdemir et al 2013 which found an increase in maximum water depth and decrease in inundation extent with increasing dem resolution prior work on dem properties and flood inundation in natural stream reaches by saksena and merwade 2015 also found that coarser dem resolution overpredicts the flood extent further hossain anni et al 2020 used the 1d 2d coupled mike flood model and found that the absence of detailed stormwater infrastructure data significantly overestimated flood water volume our work aligns with these results but extends this area of research to investigate how dem resolution and data gaps interact fig 11 4 3 research implications and limitations spatial data quality as defined by accuracy current ness completeness consistency fox et al 1994 has been widely recognized to be of significant value in research and practice this is especially true when electronic databases are produced integrated and updated by multiple private and public sectors and the reliance on secondary data sources increases for decision support tools as the effect of data completeness on urban flood modeling has not been fully understood this study aimed to understand the effect of stormwater infrastructure data completeness on urban flood modeling for the producers of these datasets it is necessary to understand how incomplete data and errors propagate to model performance as per veregin 1999 data incompleteness occurs due to the errors of omission i e infrastructure components not being recorded and error of commission i e assignment of incorrect data for consumers of these datasets this study cautions careful evaluation of data quality before analysis and decision making the study also highlights the absence of a consistent approach to filling missing stormwater infrastructure data for modeling applications the first experiment of this study assessed the impact of stormwater infrastructure attribute value completeness on hydrologic and hydrodynamic model performance by auto filling data gaps using an algorithm based on available data and design standards note that there is no established way to fill missing data at scale thus we have utilized design standards and available data that are readily available in practice and could be automated as done here to facilitate monte carlo sampling or executed manually without the need for coding expertise therefore the algorithm is appropriate to address a set of research questions closely linked to practice design standards vary locally and the algorithms could be customized for example the minimum cover required for conduits differs regionally due to winter temperatures and risk of freezing one limitation of this study is that the findings are specific to the city of phoenix the relationship between pmd error and uncertainty might vary with the characteristics of the network and catchment however the method and algorithm could be readily adapted to other catchments to understand the effects of these characteristics the error and precision resulting from missing data was in part a product of the algorithm used to estimate missing attribute values further refinements to this algorithm could improve performance and reduce the error and uncertainty associated with attribute value gaps additionally a limitation in random sampling was that the features were complete in all the models and only attribute values get removed and replaced in sampling the random sampling algorithm does not consider missing features since it would require auto model building or network generating programming this is out of scope of the current analysis but assessing the combined impact of missing feature and attribute values is an important line of future work in addition to assessing the impact of missing attribute values the first experiment helps to prioritize data collection efforts results showed that missing attribute values pertaining to the downstream region of the drainage network lead to higher model error and uncertainty when compared to upstream data gaps fig 6 this suggests that if resources for field surveys are limited prioritizing the downstream section of the network would yield greater improvements in accuracy results also show that model performance is particularly sensitive to missing diameter values as shown by mae and pbias tables 4 and 5 this suggests that efforts to improve attribute value estimation algorithms should focus on diameter however the results presented here are for one catchment testing the impact of the location of missing data in other catchments with different network geometry and topography should be explored further although the monte carlo based sampling algorithm was developed to investigate the effect of pmd and location of missing data on model performance this experiment confirms the utility of the approach to filling missing attribute data for example the results demonstrate that missing roughness data could be effectively estimated using an empirical distribution of available roughness information in conjunction with information from adjacent conduits further improvements in estimating minimum depth and diameter when upstream or downstream attributes are missing can improve the accuracy and precision of the model the second experiment of this study tested the effects of infrastructure data completeness and model resolution on model performance model resolution is usually selected based on the desired level of simulation accuracy time availability and resource availability further analysis is needed to compare the value of incremental changes in model resolution to the effort and resources required however even when data and computational resources are readily available the appropriate model resolution critically depends on the core purpose of the model for example within urban flood modeling the core purpose of estimating total flood volume versus the location or duration of flood impacts might suggest a different model resolution low resolution models have the benefit of lower computation time which may be critical for applications such as real time pluvial flood forecasting or quick flood estimation in this study the low resolution model simulation took 9 5 min while the high resolution model took 49 min note these computation times were based on the computer specification of 64 bit i7 cpd 3 6 ghz processor used in this experiment however for infrastructure planning including adaptation of existing stormwater infrastructure model accuracy is more important than computation time in pluvial flood estimation the difference of a few inches of water could mean basement flooding disruption of traffic and safety hazards further the uncertainty from incomplete data and coarser model resolution selection is too high to optimize flood control measures such as green infrastructure which have localized flood mitigation potential we used 50 missing features in the low data incomplete infrastructure data models and further analysis using different levels of missing stormwater infrastructure features in combination with different model resolutions on different types of catchments would be beneficial while the key effects quantified here are specific to the study area some results are generalizable as there will be similar but varied degree of error bias and uncertainty in simulating hydrologic hydraulic variables due to missing attribute values and features data of stormwater infrastructure and improper selection of model resolution 5 conclusions this study consists of a two part experiment to investigate the effect of data completeness and model resolution on urban flood model performance by random sampling and selective sampling an algorithm was built to randomly remove and replace attribute values for the hydrologic hydraulic stormwater model built using the epa s swmm random sampling was done for attribute values using the 1d model then selective sampling was applied to feature data completeness and model resolution using the computationally demanding 1d 2d model results demonstrated that the relationship between model uncertainty and pmd is dependent on the attribute or parameter in question in contrast accuracy consistently decreases with an increasing pmd except for diameter we also found that missing data in the downstream section of the catchment leads to greater uncertainty and lower accuracy compared to missing data upstream this finding can inform the prioritization of data collection and verification efforts where resources are limited the total flood duration and extent may be over or underestimated due to incomplete infrastructure data depending on model resolution in the swmm 1d 2d selective sampling the highest flood depth was simulated by the high resolution models in contrast the highest flood extent and volume were simulated by the low resolution models in sum both data completeness and model resolution determine the accuracy of flood depth extent and volume estimates this emphasizes the importance of high resolution modeling and complete data for urban flood estimation at the scale of pedestrian and vehicle flood hazards where accurate flood extent volume and depth are critical the risks of pluvial flooding are projected to grow in many cities as they experience more intense precipitation due to climate change and as urbanization decreases permeable area modeling can be an effective tool to understand pluvial flooding and make projections that enable effective adaptation and response understanding quantifying and communicating error and uncertainties arising from various sources are essential for decision making however infrastructure data gaps are a common obstacle and prior research has not addressed the impact of these gaps on model performance in addition access to high resolution lidar is limited globally in this study we focused on infrastructure data gap and model resolution which are key pieces to an accurate and precise model this study shows that the error and uncertainty in simulating hydrologic hydraulic variables due to prevalence of missing stormwater infrastructure data and selection of improper model resolution could be significant and might affect the quality of the model application hydrologic hydraulic models are increasingly being used in stormwater design real time modeling of pluvial flooding and impact or damage assessment with the growing focus on the importance of pluvial flooding as well as increasing use of physically based models we need a cost effective approach to overcome data gaps this problem can be dissected into two sub parts assessment and application the monte carlo based sampling algorithm was developed as an assessment approach to quantify the effect of missing attribute value as presented here the algorithm can also be used to fill missing attribute values in large stormwater infrastructure datasets it can be further developed to improve its accuracy and precision and to adapt it to different contexts in sum this work takes a first step to address an understudied challenge in urban stormwater modeling developing tools and

3552,the accuracy of hydrologic and hydrodynamic models used to study urban hydrology and predict urban flooding depends on the availability of high resolution terrain and infrastructure data unfortunately cities often do not have or cannot release complete infrastructure data and high resolution terrain data products are not available everywhere in this study we quantify how the accuracy and precision of urban hydrologic hydrodynamic models vary as a function of data completeness and model resolution for this aim we apply the one dimensional 1d and coupled one and two dimensional 1d 2d versions of the u s environmental protection agency s storm water management model swmm in an urban catchment in the city of phoenix arizona here we have collected detailed infrastructure data a high resolution 0 3 m lidar based digital elevation model and catchment properties data we tested several model configurations assuming different levels of i availability of stormwater infrastructure data ranging from 5 to 75 of attribute values missing and ii terrain aggregation i e 4 6 m and 9 7 m these configurations were generated through random monte carlo sampling for swmm 1d and selective sampling with four cases for swmm 1d 2d we ran simulations under the 50 year return period design storm and compared simulated flood metrics assuming the highest resolution and complete data model configuration as a reference the study found that the model may over or underestimate flood volume and duration with different levels of missing data depending on the parameters roughness diameter or depth and that model performance is more sensitive to missing data that is downstream and closer to the outfall as opposed to missing data upstream errors in flood depth area and volume estimation are functions of both the data completeness and model resolution missing feature data leads to overestimation of flood depth while lower model resolution results in underestimating flood depth and overestimating flood extent and volume keywords urban flood urban stormwater hydrodynamic modeling swmm urban infrastructure sampling algorithm 1 introduction urban flooding is a natural hazard impacting public health environmental quality and the economy rahmati et al 2020 although the national level economic and social costs of urban flooding in the u s are not routinely recorded past flood events have resulted in significant property damage and casualties the national academy press 2019 university of maryland and texas a m university 2018 for example urban flooding in cook county illinois resulted in flood losses at a cost of 660 million between 2007 and 2011 festing et al 2014 additionally a 1000 year rainfall event in ellicott city maryland in may 2018 caused over one billion dollars in damages and heavy rainfall in the metropolitan detroit area in august 2014 resulted in over 1 8 billion in damages university of maryland and texas a m university 2018 damages of urban flooding have been also documented outside of u s including in copenhagen denmark in july 2011 catania italy in october 2018 prokić et al 2019 chennai india in november and december 2015 nithila devi et al 2019 ho chi minh vietnam in november 2018 leitold et al 2021 beijing china in july 2012 jiang et al 2018 and nagoya city japan in autumn 2020 tanaka et al 2020 unfortunately the risk of urban flooding will likely increase worldwide because of intense urbanization and climate change urban growth results in a conversion of natural land into impervious areas which in turn increases runoff and reduces infiltration if proper drainage systems are not put in place global warming will likely lead to more intense and frequent extreme precipitation farris et al 2021 jung et al 2011 moftakhari et al 2015 wehner et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 climate projections for the u s estimate that the intensity of the heaviest 1 of precipitation events will likely rise across most regions under both intermediate and worst case climate change scenarios of representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 with the highest projected increase of 40 by 2100 compared to 1986 2015 under rcp 8 5 in midwest and northeast the national academy press 2019 one of the major flood generating mechanisms in cities is pluvial flooding which occurs when the precipitation intensity exceeds infiltration rate and drainage capacity rosenzweig et al 2018 pluvial flooding is particularly impactful in urban areas because of the lower threshold for runoff generation and the shorter time of concentration this flood mechanism has received less attention compared to fluvial or coastal flooding rosenzweig et al 2018 for example the federal emergency management agency s fema s flood hazard analysis and mapping focus only on riverine and coastal flooding the national academy press 2019 in a study by the first street foundation 2020 which included pluvial flooding among other flooding mechanisms the number of properties across the u s with substantial flood risk defined as inundation 1 cm during 1 in 100 year flood was found to be 1 7 times fema s estimate confirming the importance of pluvial flooding in the u k it has been estimated that damages from urban pluvial flooding in 2008 exceeded 0 36 billion which is a lower cost than the 0 8 2 8 billion calculated for fluvial and coastal flooding however future projections indicate that losses due to urban flooding will become similar to or higher than those of other flooding types by 2080 dawson et al 2008 hall et al 2005 the simulation of pluvial flooding requires capturing a range of hydrologic and hydraulic processes including rainfall runoff transformation overland flow routing and pipe flows for this aim hydrologic models with different levels of sophistication have been coupled to hydraulic models simulating water flow in the drainage networks and on the land surface guo et al 2020 leandro et al 2009 noh et al 2018 seyoum et al 2012 vojinovic and tutulic 2009 a key requirement to increase the predictive skill of these coupled hydrologic hydraulic models is to incorporate small scale heterogeneities of terrain and stormwater infrastructure into the simulations fewtrell et al 2008 gallegos et al 2009 this is because the impacts of pluvial flooding vary significantly at small spatial scales for example six inches of moving floodwater can knock down a pedestrian and cause vehicles to loose traction national weather service nws n d in urban areas where topography is highly heterogeneous such changes in elevation can happen over short distances while recent advances have been made towards model improvement and coupling cantone and schmidt 2011 chang et al 2015 henonin et al 2013 leandro and martins 2016 nanía et al 2015 wu et al 2018 the sources of errors in simulations of urban flooding have not yet been fully explored because of uncertainty and limited availability of geospatial data terrain soil land cover and infrastructure and high resolution precipitation forcing required to setup and run the simulations of particular importance to increase accuracy of pluvial flooding prediction is the integration of infrastructure and high resolution terrain data association of state floodplain managers asfpm 2020 infrastructure data includes all components of built stormwater systems such as catch basins manholes conduits detention and storage basins drywells and outfalls whereas terrain data includes urban features such as buildings street curbs overpasses and bridges unfortunately these datasets are often incomplete or of poor quality and data collection efforts are resource intensive important characteristics of such spatial data quality are completeness accuracy consistency and current ness fox et al 1994 veregin 1999 data completeness as defined by fox et al 1994 is the degree to which a data collection has values for all the attributes of all the features guptill and morrison 1995 and veregin 1999 further characterize data completeness as feature completeness attribute completeness and value completeness for example in a stormwater database features include components like conduits catch basins and manholes each feature has attributes such as material or diameter for conduits and attributes have numerical or categorical values in a complete stormwater database all the system components as features and its attributes and values are present model development is also challenged by the limited availability of high resolution spatial data e g 1 m digital elevation models or dems and the need to balance computational cost with accuracy requirements the resolutions of commonly available dems e g 10 m in u s united states geological survey usgs n d do not sufficiently capture fine details of urban infrastructure features such as walls curbs steps and storm drains thus preventing the simulation of overland flow in complex urban environments fewtrell et al 2008 krebs et al 2014 leitão et al 2016 sampson et al 2012 past studies have cautioned that the ideal spatial resolution is between 2 and 5 m for the effective representation of urban features arrighi and campo 2019 dottori et al 2013 the advent of airborne light detection and ranging lidar has increased the availability of high resolution less than 1 m topographic data that would allow incorporating small scale heterogeneities found in urban basins into hydrologic models bates et al 2003 bermúdez and zischg 2018 fewtrell et al 2011 noh et al 2018 sampson et al 2012 despite this promising capability lidar products are available at limited sites are expensive to acquire and require significant computational resources to be processed and used in numerical models more insight is then needed to weigh costs and benefits of investment in lidar for urban flood modeling previous studies have evaluated the impacts of simplifying the model representation of certain elements krebs et al 2014 and prior research demonstrates that select aggregation may have limited impacts on model results for example elliot et al 2009 assessed different aggregations of detention tanks and bioretention as well as their associated catchment areas finding that there is little effect on predictions of mean flow baseflow and water quality at the outlet however while aggregation of stormwater control features allows modeling water balance or outflow hydrograph at a lower computational cost this approach provides limited information on location duration and extent of the flood which is crucial when modeling the impacts of pluvial flooding thus additional research is needed to assess the feasibility of aggregation for spatially distributed street flooding estimation as hydrologic hydraulic models for urban flood modeling are critical to flood prediction infrastructure design and adaptation planning it is crucial to also understand the impact of different sources of error and uncertainty pathak et al 2015 for engineers and planners developing asset management plans harvey et al 2017 designing flood mitigation infrastructure kabisch et al 2017 kuriqi and hysa 2021 or rehabilitating drainage structures martínez et al 2018 accurate hydraulic information of the drainage system as well as communication of output uncertainty is vital several past studies on different catchment scales focused on 1 quantifying the rainfall error uncertainty on hydrologic model outputs arising from temporal resolution lyu et al 2018 data products such as satellite rainfall bitew and gebremichael 2011 or radar rainfall error propagation hjelmstad et al 2021 sharif et al 2002 2 quantifying effect of dem resolution on urban flood modeling leitão et al 2009 leitão and de sousa 2018 however little is known about modeling errors arising from missing infrastructure data e g missing features or components or properties of these features e g missing attributes and standard approaches on how to deal with data gaps are nonexistent further the effect of dem and model resolution in conjugation with completeness of infrastructure features in coupled 1d 2d model is not fully understood or quantified this study aims at addressing two research questions motivated by the challenges in pluvial urban flood modeling described above including 1 how do the proportion and spatial distribution of infrastructure data gaps impact model performance and 2 how does the spatial resolution of the terrain data interact with infrastructure data gaps to impact the model performance model performance is defined as accuracy and precision in modeling flood flow rate volume duration and extent to examine these research questions we simulated pluvial flooding in an urban catchment in the city of phoenix arizona using a semi distributed coupled hydrological hydraulic model based on the u s environmental protection agency s epa storm water management model we first explored the effect of missing data i e attribute value of parameters using the one dimensional rainfall runoff and pipe flow model swmm 1d we then examined the combined effect of model resolution i e high and low model resolution and data completeness i e missing stormwater features using the coupled 1d 2d model version swmm 1d 2d in sum our objectives are to assess model error bias and uncertainty arising from missing infrastructure attribute data and to investigate the combined effect of infrastructure feature data gaps and coarsening model resolution 2 study area data collection and processing to answer our research questions we focus on an urban catchment in the city of phoenix arizona since the city faces periodic pluvial floods and the required infrastructure data are complete and accessible fig 1 a phoenix is the capital of the state and the main city of one of the largest metropolitan regions in the u s with a population of approximately 4 5 million people it is in central arizona and the northeastern sonoran desert downstream of the confluence between the salt and verde rivers according to the köppen classification the climate is hot desert or arid bwh with extreme hot summers and mild short winters the average yearly precipitation is 204 mm while the mean temperature is 24 c mascaro 2017 climate is characterized by two main seasons that influence the rainfall regime the first includes a summer period from july to september that is dominated by the north american monsoon when convective activity leads to diurnally modulated localized thunderstorms with short durations less than 1h and high rain intensity balling and brazel 1986 the second season which ranges from late october through march is dry and occasionally interrupted by cold fronts causing widespread storm systems with low to moderate rainfall intensity and relatively longer durations of up to a few days sheppard et al 2002 monsoonal thunderstorms cause severe flash flood events in the region though other storm types can also trigger flooding for example in september 2014 the remnants of hurricane norbert triggered pluvial flooding inundating major roadways throughout the valley nws 2014 in central arizona the spatial variability of annual seasonal and extreme rainfall is moderately to significantly controlled by terrain which varies from 220 to 2 325 m above mean sea level msl mascaro 2020 2018 2017 the topography of phoenix is generally flat the urban form is characterized by a street pattern running in precise grids and such is the stormwater infrastructure layout our study catchment has a total area of 2 4 km2 the catchment runoff drains to the south of the main outfall into the salt river fig 1b the soil type distribution in the study catchment is presented in table s1 the weighted average imperviousness relative to the discretized sub catchments area is 71 24 while maximum is 99 table s2 the summary of data used in this study is shown in table 1 and fig 2 table 1 classifies data as vector raster or point cloud these data are either raw processed by the authors for this study or secondary data obtained from the noted source fig 2 shows the layers of spatial data required to build swmm 1d 2d models swmm 1d model also utilizes the same layers without terrain data layers namely building and mesh grids stormwater infrastructure data with complete features and attribute values is critical to build the hydrologic hydraulic model and simulate catchment behavior the geodatabase for the infrastructure components in phoenix is stored and updated at irregular intervals by the phoenix public works department we obtained the infrastructure data which is not publicly available from the public works department in 2019 to ensure that there are no missing data or inconsistencies in the gis database we verified through field visits that surface infrastructure features were properly located the stormwater infrastructure data for the study catchment includes 430 catch basins to collect stormwater runoff 613 manholes and other nodes which connect upstream and downstream conduits 1 091 conduits with attributes of material year built depth slope shape and size 26 drywells which infiltrate stormwater and are usually present in flat topography and 1 major outfall where stormwater drains to the salt river the details of stormwater components in our study catchment are shown in figs 1b and 2a following the definition of data completeness by guptill and morrison 1995 and veregin 1999 in this study we characterize data completeness as feature completeness which refers to the known presence and location of all stormwater infrastructure components and attribute value completeness which refers to known attributes and values of each component accuracy can also be assessed for both features and attribute values feature accuracy refers to whether the feature type and location are correct while attribute value accuracy refers to whether infrastructure attributes e g diameter are correct this study uses the single most current and thus consistent infrastructure dataset therefore this analysis does not focus on data consistency nor current ness here we assume that our field verified infrastructure data set is both complete and accurate we then refer to this infrastructure dataset as the ground truth and the corresponding model built as the ground truth model point cloud lidar data were available as a terrain data with 0 3 m spacing for the city of phoenix asu 2018 only the point cloud data with return points excluding buildings and vegetations were selected using the las filter and create las dataset geoprocessing tool in arcgis pro to create a ground based dem fig 2b that includes the details of street level and curbs since the use of the 0 3 m resolution dem is computationally too intensive for 2d overland flow computations a 4 6 m resolution dem was also generated to create the 2d model fig 2c in addition to the dems we created a 0 3 m digital surface model dsm that includes buildings fig 2d but not trees as trees do not impede water flow throughout their full canopy area in order to delineate the watershed the buildings act as an impermeable obstruction layer in swmm 1d 2d model data on the catchment soil types and properties e g suction head saturated hydraulic conductivity fig 2e were obtained from the arizona department of transportation adot 2014 urban imperviousness data from 2016 with a resolution of 30 m was used as seen in fig 2f mrlc n d the time series of design storm for a 1 50 annual exceedance probability with 45 min duration and 5 min intervals was created from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 point precipitation frequency estimates noaa nws n d using an alternating block method chow et al 1998 this study primarily focuses on extreme flood estimation rather than infrastructure design thus a higher return period was chosen this design storm was used as the input for all simulations we selected a storm duration of 45 min equivalent to the time of concentration for the catchment 3 methodology in the following sections we describe the development of the semi distributed hydrologic hydraulic model using 1d and coupled 1d 2d approaches we then present the algorithm to fill attribute value data gaps and the monte carlo sampling approach for attribute value completeness lastly we describe the selective sampling approach to assess the combined effect of feature completeness and model resolution 3 1 hydrologic hydraulic model we used the u s epa s swmm version 5 1 1d model and computational hydraulics international chi s pcswmm version 7 3 3095 coupled 1d 2d model to execute the model and facilitate monte carlo sampling we used the r package swmmr version 0 9 1 leutnant et al 2019 swmm is a hydrologic hydraulic modeling tool that simulates rainfall runoff and routing processes for single precipitation events or in a continuous fashion in urban or rural catchments it estimates two main processes i runoff which is computed on a collection of discretized sub catchments that generate runoff and pollutants due to precipitation and ii routing which is the transport of runoff across an underground network of conduits overland channels and other components swmm is a semi distributed model and it accounts for various hydrologic processes such as time varying rainfall evaporation from standing water rainfall interception in depression storage infiltration into unsaturated soil layers percolation into groundwater layers interflow between groundwater and the drainage system non linear reservoir routing of overland flow and stormwater capture by low impact development the details about theoretical background equations variables features and capabilities of swmm can be found in rossman 2017 and james et al 2010 in this study we apply two implementations of swmm 1 a one dimensional drainage model swmm 1d and 2 a coupled 1d 2d model swmm 1d 2d that adds two dimensional routing of overland flow of floodwaters we used swmm 1d to test the effect of infrastructure data attribute value completeness the 1d model was chosen for its faster computation time compared to the coupled 1d 2d model and the ability to execute the model from the source code which enables monte carlo sampling swmm 1d 2d was used to assess the combined effects of data feature completeness and model resolution in practice a large spatial infrastructure data set is rarely 100 percent complete due to manual data entry error compilation error and antiquated data as new construction or rehabilitation takes place however for this study we assume that the data we acquired from the phoenix public works department and verified by walk through surveys are 100 percent complete and accurate we define this data as the ground truth where all the required features and attribute values are complete and accurate the ground truth model built from this data and the highest feasible resolution of dem serves as the basis for comparing simulations described in the next section the hydrologic component of swmm simulates the rainfall runoff transformation after accounting for losses through a non linear reservoir model where the reservoir capacity is maximum depression storage in this model the study area catchment is discretized into sub catchments to reflect the spatial heterogeneity in topography drainage pathway land cover and soil characteristics that impact rainfall runoff we utilized the 0 3 m dsm consisting of street profiles buildings and general topography to delineate the watershed and discretize it into smaller sub catchments with an average area of 2 428 m2 using the watershed delineation tools of pcswmm the hydrologic model input is precipitation and the output from each sub catchment are surface runoff and losses due to infiltration and evaporation surface runoff is defined as the excess volume above the depression storage which considers the initial abstraction such as surface ponding interception by flat roofs vegetation and surface wetting which eventually evaporates or infiltrates following the storm depression storages of 1 25 mm for impervious surfaces and 2 5 mm for pervious surfaces as suggested by the american society of civil engineers 1992 were assigned for each sub catchment to calculate losses due to infiltration we selected the green ampt infiltration model implemented in swmm with parameters derived from soil types adot 2014 which are presented in table s1 here discrete event simulation for the 50 year return period 45 min design storm for downtown phoenix noaa nws n d is applied to force all of the models we assumed a constant evaporation rate of 0 76 cm day western regional climate center wrcc n d corresponding to the average during monsoon season the parameters used for the stormwater system are summarized in table s3 the governing equations and additional details for the hydrologic processes as employed in the swmm can be found in rossman 2017 and james et al 2010 the hydraulic component of swmm uses the dynamic wave routine that solves unsteady flow through the network of conduits and nodes using the conservation of mass and momentum equations dynamic wave routing solves the complete one dimensional saint venant flow equations whose details can be found in rossman 2006 which account for channel storage backwater effects entrance exit losses and pressurized flow flooding in the system occurs when the hydraulic grade line at a node exceeds the threshold of available depth i e rim elevation the flooded water in swmm 1d is accounted as flooding losses which will not re enter the drainage network unless ponding is allowed the surcharge depth for manholes was assigned as 0 4 m which is equivalent to the resistance of manhole lid cover weight the parameters for the sub catchments and infrastructure are extracted directly from the attribute values in the infrastructure database soil data or dem these parameters include rim elevation invert elevation and depth for catch basin and manholes junctions or nodes roughness length diameter cross section and slope for conduits invert elevation for outfalls and drywells nodes and area slope imperviousness and green ampt parameters for sub catchments the relevant outputs from the hydraulic component include 1 time series of flooding and flow at all nodes and conduits respectively 2 flood loss time series i e flow exiting the drainage system when the hydraulic grade line reaches the surface at all nodes and in aggregate hereafter referred to as system flooding and 3 duration of flooding and surcharge at all nodes the duration of node flooding is the length of time when the hydraulic grade line is above the rim elevation for a particular node to maintain numerical stability and remove continuity error a time step of 1 s was selected for both swmm 1d and 1d 2d models for 1d 2d coupled modeling we used pcswmm due to its additional capability to simulate overland flood routing and associated flood extent depth and duration in two dimensions this model extends the fully dynamic 1d approach in epa s swmm5 to 2d free surface flow using a non uniform mesh that captures the topography geometry and built structures swmm 2d domain solves swmm5 dynamic wave routing with or without inertial terms ignoring inertial terms creates diffusive wave routing which is virtually indistinguishable from full term dynamic wave solution finney et al 2012 james et al 2013 in the 2d domain the overland surface is discretized into a square mesh and represents each 2d cell with a 2d node or a junction where invert elevation for these nodes is assigned the ground surface elevation or rim elevation of adjacent coupled 1d nodes finney et al 2012 james et al 2013 in the 2d domain of 1d 2d coupled model grid cells require slope and roughness parameters swmm 1d 2d uses the same sub catchment delineation and catchment properties as well as hydraulic network and hydrologic properties as described above for swmm 1d the catch basin nodes are coupled with 2d mesh cells using orifices in 1d 2d integrated model such that the volume of water exiting an orifice when flooding occurs is routed over the 2d mesh cells this excess flow can pond on the overland grid cells and re enter the drainage network when the hydraulic grade subsides below ground elevation 3 2 random sampling of infrastructure data first we tested the significance of infrastructure data completeness on the model a one at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify the important infrastructure parameters using a built in tool available in pcswmm finney and gharabaghi 2011 sensitivity analysis assesses the rate of change in response of the model with respect to changes in the model input parameter and the relative importance of parameters to have more accurate values as measured by the sensitivity gradients james 2003 details of sensitivity analysis are presented in section s3 of the supplementary material we selected five infrastructure related parameters from stormwater components conduit diameter node depth i e maximum distance from invert elevation to rim elevation conduit roughness inlet offset i e the distance from a conduit s inlet end to the connected node invert elevation and outlet offset i e the distance from a conduit s outlet end to the connected node invert elevation all parameters are sampled uniformly within lower to higher parameter values given by an uncertainty level of 50 as described in section s3 out of the five parameters tested we found that the three most sensitive parameters are conduit roughness conduit diameter and node depth hereafter referred to as roughness diameter and depth as shown in table 2 where larger absolute values of the sensitivity gradient indicates more sensitive parameters to test the impact of missing attribute value data on the model we developed an algorithm to randomly sample conduits and nodes remove values of roughness diameter and depth in these selected features and estimate these missing attribute values using the remaining data and design standards the algorithm enables us to test many combinations of missing attribute values using monte carlo sampling the replacement component of the algorithm is essential as a swmm model cannot be run without specifying all parameter values the replacement criteria for missing attribute value is implemented in accordance with the available design standards and modeling practice the detailed process algorithm is described below and the overall method for random sampling is illustrated in fig 3 the algorithm to sample roughness diameter and depth illustrated in fig 3 develops and runs a new swmm 1d model for each iteration n 100 times by randomly removing a specified percentage of each of the three parameters identified above then filling these gaps based on the remaining information available the process can be summarized into three main steps 1 randomly select the number of conduits and nodes corresponding with the percent of missing attribute values specified i e m number of features to be sampled per parameter for the selected sample delete existing roughness diameter or depth 2 replace deleted attribute values with an informed estimate the estimation algorithm is specific to the parameter a roughness identify the upstream pipe and apply its roughness if the upstream roughness attribute is missing then use the downstream roughness if both upstream and downstream roughness are missing randomly sample an empirical distribution function edf of roughness from available information i e conduits with known roughness the empirical distribution of roughness in the ground truth model is presented in fig s2 of the supplementary material section s5 b diameter identify the upstream pipe and apply its diameter if the upstream diameter attribute is missing then use the downstream diameter if both upstream and downstream diameters are missing then use the mean diameter of all conduits in the dataset with known diameters c depth identify the upstream node and apply its depth if upstream depth is missing then use the depth of downstream feature if both upstream and downstream depths are missing assume a minimum cover of 0 91 m as per the arizona drainage design manual adot 2014 the node depth information is shared by both connected node or junction and conduits note that there are a few conduits with 0 slope in the ground truth and randomly sampled models particularly for shorter length conduits but the overall slope is positive in addition elevation of the street surface and the rim elevations gradually slope downward from upstream to downstream nodes thus in this particular catchment the negative slopes are avoided when sampling depth 3 run swmm 1d and extract the time series of system flooding and duration of flooding if present at each node model accuracy is defined relative to the ground truth model output and is quantified by the mean absolute error mae and percent bias pbias the mae and pbias for system flooding sf in subscript are defined as 1 mae sf 1 n j 1 n 1 t t 1 t y t j x t 2 pbia s sf 1 n j 1 n t 1 t y t j x t t 1 t x t where yt j is the simulated flow at each time steps t t 1 t for the j th j 1 n iterations where n 100 and x t is the value simulated by the ground truth model both maesf and pbiassf were first computed as the comparison of hydrographs obtained from sampled and ground truth models and then averaged across all 100 iterations for the duration of node flooding mae and pbias fd in subscript were computed from the mean and maximum durations of node flooding in 100 iterations compared to the ground truth which is defined as 3 ma e fd j 1 n y j x j n 4 pbias fd j 1 n y j x j j 1 n x j 100 where y j is mean or maximum duration of node flooding for each j 1 to nth iteration where n 100 x j is the mean or maximum duration of node flooding in the ground truth model model uncertainty describes the degree of variation in model output across sampled simulations and is quantified by the relative interquartile range riqr which is defined as 5 riqr q 0 75 q 0 25 q 0 5 100 where q 0 75 q 0 25 and q 0 5 represent upper quartile lower quartile and median respectively for the empirical distributions of either maximum system flooding i e peak flow or duration of flooding averaged or maximum across all nodes precision is referred to as the inverse of uncertainty the significance of missing data was tested in terms of the level and location of missing data for different levels of missing data 5 25 50 and 75 the number of features sampled m is the corresponding percentage of missing data multiplied by the total number of relevant features i e conduits or nodes then to assess the impact of the location of missing data we assumed that 50 of data is missing and divided the catchment into two regions the upstream and downstream the 50 missing data level was selected because as shown later in the results model error increased consistently across parameters with increasing missing data until 50 when sampling the full catchment beyond 50 the pattern was mixed the upstream and downstream features were identified by conditional selection of features that are above or below the median distance from the main outfall for the upstream or downstream region respectively to test the influence of the location of missing data the random sampling method described above with the same n 100 iterations was repeated with the removed attribute values limited to the upstream and then downstream regions of the network for random sampling only the swmm 1d model was used since the computation time of swmm 1d 2d is too long to perform many runs the swmm 1d 2d model was reserved for selective sampling as described next 3 3 selective sampling we applied selective sampling of swmm 1d 2d models to assess the impact of different combinations of feature data completeness and model resolution on model performance model resolution for the semi distributed model is defined in terms of the resolutions of the 2d mesh grid and the dem utilized to create such a grid four selective sampling models were created table 3 in the low resolution models hdlm and ldlm slopes for the discretized sub catchments were assigned from the coarser resolution 9 7 m dem to account for the fact that high resolution terrain could not be available in all places and that the most commonly available dem resolution from usgs is 1 3rd arc second 10 m although two of the selective sampling models ldlm and ldhm have missing features or incomplete infrastructure data the attribute values for all remaining features are the same as the ground truth the selective sampling results were compared in terms of flood depth volume and extent flood depth refers to the maximum water level observed in the 2d mesh cells at the time of peak flooding flood volume refers to the sum of all flooding fluxes from 1d nodes to 2d grid cells through orifices integrated over the whole flood period flood extent refers to the sum of the areas of 2d mesh cells with floodwater 0 mm at the time of peak flooding 4 results and discussion this section first presents simulation results from monte carlo sampling of swmm 1d model recounting the effects of different levels and locations of incomplete data on modeled peak flood flow and duration then we present swmm 1d 2d modeling results for four selective sampling models characterized by combinations of complete or incomplete infrastructure data and high or low model resolution particularly focusing on flood depth extent and volume 4 1 evaluation of random sampling the impacts of missing attribute values for the three selected model parameters on the simulated flooding conditions and metrics are summarized in figs 4 and 5 specifically fig 4 shows the distribution of simulated flood duration at all nodes for the three sampled parameters in 100 monte carlo sampling and the ground truth model at different percentages of missing attribute values fig 5 presents boxplots of 100 monte carlo sampling for maximum system flooding fig 5a c maximum flooding duration fig 5d f and average flooding duration fig 5g i as a function of percent of missing data hereafter pmd table 4 reports error and uncertainty metrics as defined in section 3 2 for the clarity of exposition these figures and table are discussed in the following three sub sections focusing separately on sampling roughness diameter and depth finally in the last subsection we illustrate the effect of missing attribute values at upstream and downstream portions of the basin for pmd 50 for the three parameters 4 1 1 effect of roughness we begin by discussing fig 4 where the distribution of flood duration simulated by the ground truth model is displayed by a red curve whereas the ensemble simulations of 100 iterations for different levels of missing data are shown by grey curves the ground truth model predicts that 564 nodes will be flooded for a varied duration from 0 01 to 1 03 hr or an overall average duration of 0 21 hr the density plot for ground truth fig 4 shows the number of flooded nodes decreases rapidly for durations up to 0 2 hr rises slightly until 0 5 hr and then decreases at a lower rate up to about 1 hr when only 5 of the roughness data are missing the ground truth distribution is well captured across the simulations fig 4a however as pmd increases fig 4b d the monte carlo runs simulate slightly higher number of nodes that are flooded for 0 01 hr and slight increase in uncertainty observed between 0 1 and 0 5 hr fig 5a d g and table 4 show that errors bias and uncertainty of the simulated flood metrics increase only slightly as pmd of roughness increases bias and uncertainty are low but increase for higher pmd as seen in the peak flooding flow rate maximum pbias of 0 45 max riqr of 0 27 maximum duration maximum pbias of 1 max riqr of 2 94 and average duration maximum pbias of 1 2 max riqr of 1 53 in other words when the data available on pipe roughness decreases our algorithm designed to replace missing data results in low error bias and uncertainty this is explained in part by algorithm skill and in part by the fact that in the ground truth data the majority 90 of the conduits are concrete including reinforced concrete and rubber gasket reinforced concrete pipe all of which have an average roughness of 0 015 sec m1 3 as presented in the fig s2 of the supplementary material given the shape of this empirical distribution the probability of sampling the incorrect roughness is low acknowledging that other locations will present a greater challenge for sampling roughness we investigated how the pmd for roughness would affect the model outputs if the distribution was not dominated by a single conduit material for this we created a hypothetical set of conduits using the same model and holding other parameters constant where distribution of materials is 12 concrete 51 corrugated metal pipe and 37 smooth plastic hdpe or pvc this distribution is valid per the drainage design standards city of phoenix 2013 see section s5 for details in this hypothetical conduit distribution we found that error bias and uncertainty are higher but remain moderate at 50 pmd or lower pbias less than 5 riqr less than 10 figs s3 s4 and table s4 the error associated with different pmd of roughness could be reduced with information on the relationship between pipe age size and material if available 4 1 2 effect of diameter the effect of increasing the diameter pmd on the simulated distribution of flood duration is fig 4e h 1 lower higher number of nodes for durations between 0 01 and 0 3 hr 0 6 and 0 9 hr 2 equal likelihood of simulating higher or lower number of nodes flooded between 0 3 and 0 5 hr however the uncertainty does not increase consistently with pmd the boxplots of the three flood metrics related to missing diameter data exhibit a nonlinear behavior fig 5b e h the peak system flooding and mean flood duration are overestimated while maximum flood duration is underestimated this is because the maximum flood duration tends to occur at the peripheral nodes connected to 0 3 m diameter pipes in the network where sub catchment runoff drains into the network whose downstream conduit s diameter are usually 0 3 m thus the current sampling algorithm underestimates peripheral node surcharge and flooding and the majority of monte carlo simulations underestimate maximum flood duration for all metrics the largest mae is obtained for pmd 50 the largest pbias for peak system flooding and mean flood duration is also obtained for pmd 50 the largest uncertainty for peak system flooding is obtained for pmd 25 for maximum flood duration is obtained for pmd 5 but for mean flood duration is obtained for pmd 75 while uncertainty range is similar for pmd 5 to 25 table 4 when sampling from pmd 5 to 50 error increased for all metrics but uncertainty decreased for peak system flooding and maximum flood duration or remained stable for mean flood duration at pmd 75 sampling results showed slight improvement in accuracy as shown by mae and observed in fig 5b e h these outcomes are a consequence of the algorithm adopted to replace missing diameter data as pmd rises there are more chances that missing diameters are assigned the average diameter of the stormwater system see fig 3 so that several peripheral pipes trunk pipes in the network are oversized undersized in the ground truth model 68 7 of conduits are circular 0 3 m pipes but the average is 0 46 m the average and median diameter are similar in this case and both result in the selection of the same standard conduit size 0 46 m or 18 in overestimating small pipes reduces the risk of stormwater capacity constraints and surcharge in the periphery of the network which explains decrease in maximum system flooding and duration of flooding in contrast underestimating large pipes leads to increased probability of surcharge along the main conduit which can also lead to surcharge in upstream peripheral conduits it is also important to note that maximum flooding duration does not signify maximum flood flow rate or volume just the longest duration 4 1 3 effect of depth the effect of missing depth on the simulated distribution of flood duration is that when pmd 5 the model simulated more flooded nodes between 0 01 and 0 1 hr but lower between 0 2 and 0 5 hr fig 4i while at pmd 25 the model is equally likely to simulate higher or lower number of nodes that will be flooding between 0 01 and 0 1 hr while it mostly simulates lower number of nodes flooded between 0 2 and 0 7 hr fig 4j when pmd 50 or 75 the model simulates lower number of nodes flooded between 0 01 and 0 1 hr it is equally likely to simulate higher or lower number of nodes flooded between 0 1 and 0 5 hr but more likely the model simulates higher number of nodes flooded between 0 5 and 0 9 hr fig 4k l error in estimating peak system flooding and average duration of nodes flooding as shown by mae and pbias increases monotonically with increasing pmd with the largest error occurring at pmd 75 fig 5c i lowest precision or highest uncertainty occurs at different pmd for different metrics table 4 there was an increase in precision for estimating peak system flooding when pmd increased to 75 from 50 and for estimating maximum flood duration when pmd increased to 50 from 25 table 4 and fig 5 c f at pmd 5 the model response does not significantly change in terms of peak system flooding fig 5c or maximum duration of nodes flooded fig 5f except the outliers for highest duration of nodes flooded are from few significant nodes being assigned average depth whose upstream and downstream depth are missing as pmd increased from 50 to 75 for the peak system flooding and from 25 to 75 for maximum duration of node flooding the model accuracy didn t change much as shown by mae and pbias table 4 the model simulates lower mean duration of nodes flooded when pmd is 5 or 25 and higher when pmd is 50 or 75 fig 5i this is because when pmd is 5 or 25 it is more likely that upstream or downstream depth is present which either increases the depth or creates uniform slopes thus improving the capacity of the network causing less surcharge in contrast when pmd is 50 or 75 it is more likely that both the upstream and downstream depth are missing thus minimum depths are assigned creating non homogenous depth thus modelers should be cautious in estimating missing depth in sum this analysis demonstrates how the missing infrastructure attribute values affects estimation of pluvial flooding under reasonable assumptions for filling missing roughness diameter and depth based on available information and design standards as shown in fig 3 while estimation could be improved by carefully examining each instance of missing data individually this is often not feasible due to resource constraints this estimation method can quickly estimate many missing attribute values and the specific algorithms can be adjusted to fit local design standards and available information 4 1 4 effect of location of missing data we also examined how model performance is affected by the location of missing data by assuming pmd 50 either in the upstream or downstream portion of the network as described in the methodology fig 6 shows boxplots of flood metrics derived from n 100 monte carlo sampling while metrics values are reported in table 5 figure s5 and table s5 in the supplementary material section s5 shows the effect of missing roughness in hypothetical conduit distribution it is apparent that lack of information in the downstream section leads to higher error bias and uncertainty this means that when missing data is in the downstream region of the catchment the approximation to fill missing data that works for upstream attributes may be insufficient it also establishes the relative importance of a feature s distance from the outfall indicating that distance from the outfall might be an important input into a more sophisticated estimation algorithm monte carlo sampling for the three parameters showed varied degrees of relative importance out of the three attributes missing diameter had the most effect in downstream sampling as it could lead to the highest error in system flooding and average duration of nodes flooding missing diameter in the downstream section led to the lowest model precision as indicated by a riqr of 0 8 for system flooding and a riqr of 14 and 4 for maximum and mean duration of nodes flooding fig 6 and table 5 4 2 evaluation of selective sampling the following section describes the impact of model resolution and infrastructure feature completeness on modeled flood depth volume and extent four cases were modeled each containing either high 0 3 m dem and 4 6 m 2d mesh hm or low 9 7 m dem and 9 7 m 2d mesh lm resolution and either high complete information hd or low 50 of upstream features missing ld infrastructure data see table 3 to visualize differences across the domains changes in dem resolution resulted in changes in the slope of discretized catchments as shown in fig 7 it is notable that the slopes of low resolution models ldlm and hdlm are much flatter than high resolution models ldhm and hdhm which include details of street profile and curbs fig 7c this means that the heterogeneity of surface topography is well captured by high resolution models whereas low resolution models suffer a loss of terrain information fig 7a b fig 8 illustrates boxplots of maximum flood depth at each cell in the four sampling domains hdlm has a narrower distribution while ldhm has a wider distribution the distributions for all four models are positively skewed all interquartile ranges including maxima showed the similar pattern ldhm resulted in the highest maximum flood depth 0 48 m which is closest to the ground truth i e hdhm value of 0 45 m low resolution models ldlm and hdlm underestimated maximum flood depth compared to the ground truth at 0 3 m and 0 28 m respectively underestimation was most profound when the infrastructure data is complete but model resolution is coarse hdlm fig 9 illustrates the pluvial flooding fluxes in the four selective sampling models for all orifices that connect the coupled swmm 1d s node with swmm 2d s mesh grid cells the flooding flux is the aggregate of all spatially distributed flood fluxes occurring at each timestep all three tested model configurations overestimated the total flooding volume compared to the ground truth hdhm the overestimation of peak flooding flux was observed when there is incomplete data ldhm and ldlm this makes sense as features such as inlets and conduits that would otherwise collect and convey stormwater are absent from these models however in the high resolution model ldhm the exchange of flood water between overland flow and underground drainage was more efficient compared to ldlm thus compared with hdhm ldhm may have incomplete data but its higher resolution results in lower error than with ldlm in term of total flood volume the spatial flooding pattern of maximum grid cell flood depth for the four selective sampling models is shown in fig 10 the high flood depths occurred in hm models as highlighted in box i fig 10a d with the maximum occurring in ldhm fig 10d and the minimum occurred in hdlm fig 10b however large flood extent occurred in lm models as highlighted in box ii fig 10b c with the maximum occurring in hdlm as compared to other two hm models in the case of incomplete stormwater infrastructure data missing features particularly catch basins preclude a realistic estimate of localized flooding and result in overestimates of flood volume depth and extent for example as highlighted with box iii some of the areas flooded when infrastructure data is incomplete ldlm and ldhm fig 10c d remain dry when complete data is available hdhm and hdlm fig 10a b this is because in swmm 1d 2d overland flow drains to the underground drainage system through catch basins and can re enter the drainage system after surcharge condition recedes note that this is a key distinction between swmm 1d and swmm 1d 2d in swmm 1d 2d the exchange of flood water takes place between the surface and subsurface as the flux in flood volume changes whereas in swmm 1d the water leaving the catch basins is counted as flooding and cannot reenter the drainage system for this reason the maximum system flooding simulated in the ground truth swmm 1d model 89 6 m3 s is higher than in the two dimensional hdhm model 73 m3 s also due to the limitations of the general 1d 2d modeling approach as employed in this study where a larger portion of infrastructure data is missing such as an area highlighted in box iv ld models will not estimate surface flooding as all catchment areas must be linked to a catch basin model resolution also plays a role as overland flood water is more effective at re entering the drainage system in higher resolution models the maximum depth out of the four selective sampling models was observed in the high resolution models however the maximum flooded area and flood volume were observed in the low resolution models as local depressions are smoothed in the coarser dem and the flood water spreads more readily to surrounding grid cells fig 10 the error in flood depth area and volume is the function of both the data completeness and model resolution all surcharged flow spills onto the overland surface represented by the mesh grid and flows both on the surface in 2d and in through the pipe network in 1d in the high resolution models higher heterogeneity in elevation allows depressions to be better represented so that there are chances for the surface flow to re enter into the 1d components this results in lower pluvial flood volume compared to the low resolution models it is crucial for mesh grids in swmm 1d 2d to represent true topographic features at the scale of flooding hazards in order to model the physical process accurately the use of 9 7 m dem and 9 7 m mesh grids underestimates heterogeneity in surface elevation and topographic features relevant to pedestrian and vehicle flood hazards fig 11 summarizes the hydrological and hydraulic output for each scenario in terms of hydrology when the model resolution was coarse infiltration and evaporation were slightly overestimated and runoff was underestimated due to the flatter slopes and loss of terrain detail fig 11 in term of hydraulics in the 1d component of swmm 1d 2d the relative comparison of the total surcharged nodes showed higher number of nodes are surcharged in lower resolution model this is because the rim elevation for nodes in hm and lm models are extracted from 0 3 m dem with heterogeneous slope and 9 7 m dem with flatter slope our results agree with prior work by ozdemir et al 2013 which found an increase in maximum water depth and decrease in inundation extent with increasing dem resolution prior work on dem properties and flood inundation in natural stream reaches by saksena and merwade 2015 also found that coarser dem resolution overpredicts the flood extent further hossain anni et al 2020 used the 1d 2d coupled mike flood model and found that the absence of detailed stormwater infrastructure data significantly overestimated flood water volume our work aligns with these results but extends this area of research to investigate how dem resolution and data gaps interact fig 11 4 3 research implications and limitations spatial data quality as defined by accuracy current ness completeness consistency fox et al 1994 has been widely recognized to be of significant value in research and practice this is especially true when electronic databases are produced integrated and updated by multiple private and public sectors and the reliance on secondary data sources increases for decision support tools as the effect of data completeness on urban flood modeling has not been fully understood this study aimed to understand the effect of stormwater infrastructure data completeness on urban flood modeling for the producers of these datasets it is necessary to understand how incomplete data and errors propagate to model performance as per veregin 1999 data incompleteness occurs due to the errors of omission i e infrastructure components not being recorded and error of commission i e assignment of incorrect data for consumers of these datasets this study cautions careful evaluation of data quality before analysis and decision making the study also highlights the absence of a consistent approach to filling missing stormwater infrastructure data for modeling applications the first experiment of this study assessed the impact of stormwater infrastructure attribute value completeness on hydrologic and hydrodynamic model performance by auto filling data gaps using an algorithm based on available data and design standards note that there is no established way to fill missing data at scale thus we have utilized design standards and available data that are readily available in practice and could be automated as done here to facilitate monte carlo sampling or executed manually without the need for coding expertise therefore the algorithm is appropriate to address a set of research questions closely linked to practice design standards vary locally and the algorithms could be customized for example the minimum cover required for conduits differs regionally due to winter temperatures and risk of freezing one limitation of this study is that the findings are specific to the city of phoenix the relationship between pmd error and uncertainty might vary with the characteristics of the network and catchment however the method and algorithm could be readily adapted to other catchments to understand the effects of these characteristics the error and precision resulting from missing data was in part a product of the algorithm used to estimate missing attribute values further refinements to this algorithm could improve performance and reduce the error and uncertainty associated with attribute value gaps additionally a limitation in random sampling was that the features were complete in all the models and only attribute values get removed and replaced in sampling the random sampling algorithm does not consider missing features since it would require auto model building or network generating programming this is out of scope of the current analysis but assessing the combined impact of missing feature and attribute values is an important line of future work in addition to assessing the impact of missing attribute values the first experiment helps to prioritize data collection efforts results showed that missing attribute values pertaining to the downstream region of the drainage network lead to higher model error and uncertainty when compared to upstream data gaps fig 6 this suggests that if resources for field surveys are limited prioritizing the downstream section of the network would yield greater improvements in accuracy results also show that model performance is particularly sensitive to missing diameter values as shown by mae and pbias tables 4 and 5 this suggests that efforts to improve attribute value estimation algorithms should focus on diameter however the results presented here are for one catchment testing the impact of the location of missing data in other catchments with different network geometry and topography should be explored further although the monte carlo based sampling algorithm was developed to investigate the effect of pmd and location of missing data on model performance this experiment confirms the utility of the approach to filling missing attribute data for example the results demonstrate that missing roughness data could be effectively estimated using an empirical distribution of available roughness information in conjunction with information from adjacent conduits further improvements in estimating minimum depth and diameter when upstream or downstream attributes are missing can improve the accuracy and precision of the model the second experiment of this study tested the effects of infrastructure data completeness and model resolution on model performance model resolution is usually selected based on the desired level of simulation accuracy time availability and resource availability further analysis is needed to compare the value of incremental changes in model resolution to the effort and resources required however even when data and computational resources are readily available the appropriate model resolution critically depends on the core purpose of the model for example within urban flood modeling the core purpose of estimating total flood volume versus the location or duration of flood impacts might suggest a different model resolution low resolution models have the benefit of lower computation time which may be critical for applications such as real time pluvial flood forecasting or quick flood estimation in this study the low resolution model simulation took 9 5 min while the high resolution model took 49 min note these computation times were based on the computer specification of 64 bit i7 cpd 3 6 ghz processor used in this experiment however for infrastructure planning including adaptation of existing stormwater infrastructure model accuracy is more important than computation time in pluvial flood estimation the difference of a few inches of water could mean basement flooding disruption of traffic and safety hazards further the uncertainty from incomplete data and coarser model resolution selection is too high to optimize flood control measures such as green infrastructure which have localized flood mitigation potential we used 50 missing features in the low data incomplete infrastructure data models and further analysis using different levels of missing stormwater infrastructure features in combination with different model resolutions on different types of catchments would be beneficial while the key effects quantified here are specific to the study area some results are generalizable as there will be similar but varied degree of error bias and uncertainty in simulating hydrologic hydraulic variables due to missing attribute values and features data of stormwater infrastructure and improper selection of model resolution 5 conclusions this study consists of a two part experiment to investigate the effect of data completeness and model resolution on urban flood model performance by random sampling and selective sampling an algorithm was built to randomly remove and replace attribute values for the hydrologic hydraulic stormwater model built using the epa s swmm random sampling was done for attribute values using the 1d model then selective sampling was applied to feature data completeness and model resolution using the computationally demanding 1d 2d model results demonstrated that the relationship between model uncertainty and pmd is dependent on the attribute or parameter in question in contrast accuracy consistently decreases with an increasing pmd except for diameter we also found that missing data in the downstream section of the catchment leads to greater uncertainty and lower accuracy compared to missing data upstream this finding can inform the prioritization of data collection and verification efforts where resources are limited the total flood duration and extent may be over or underestimated due to incomplete infrastructure data depending on model resolution in the swmm 1d 2d selective sampling the highest flood depth was simulated by the high resolution models in contrast the highest flood extent and volume were simulated by the low resolution models in sum both data completeness and model resolution determine the accuracy of flood depth extent and volume estimates this emphasizes the importance of high resolution modeling and complete data for urban flood estimation at the scale of pedestrian and vehicle flood hazards where accurate flood extent volume and depth are critical the risks of pluvial flooding are projected to grow in many cities as they experience more intense precipitation due to climate change and as urbanization decreases permeable area modeling can be an effective tool to understand pluvial flooding and make projections that enable effective adaptation and response understanding quantifying and communicating error and uncertainties arising from various sources are essential for decision making however infrastructure data gaps are a common obstacle and prior research has not addressed the impact of these gaps on model performance in addition access to high resolution lidar is limited globally in this study we focused on infrastructure data gap and model resolution which are key pieces to an accurate and precise model this study shows that the error and uncertainty in simulating hydrologic hydraulic variables due to prevalence of missing stormwater infrastructure data and selection of improper model resolution could be significant and might affect the quality of the model application hydrologic hydraulic models are increasingly being used in stormwater design real time modeling of pluvial flooding and impact or damage assessment with the growing focus on the importance of pluvial flooding as well as increasing use of physically based models we need a cost effective approach to overcome data gaps this problem can be dissected into two sub parts assessment and application the monte carlo based sampling algorithm was developed as an assessment approach to quantify the effect of missing attribute value as presented here the algorithm can also be used to fill missing attribute values in large stormwater infrastructure datasets it can be further developed to improve its accuracy and precision and to adapt it to different contexts in sum this work takes a first step to address an understudied challenge in urban stormwater modeling developing tools and

seawater intrusion on hot springs are still not fully understood typical ten hot springs in and around the anak sinchon uplift in a coastal area of the northern korean peninsula were investigated all the hot springs were near neutral to weakly alkaline high tds value of 25300 mg l was found at the hot spring closest to the coastline tds values and concentrations of na k ca2 cl and so4 2 in the hot spring waters near the coast showed decreasing trends with the distance from the coastline according to the calculation of seawater fraction three hot springs near the coast were contaminated by seawater temperatures of the geothermal reservoir were estimated to range from 103 to 170 c which were interpolated by thin plate spline to predict the local trend of the reservoir temperature distribution mg2 concentration was used to determine the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion among the three seawater contaminated hot springs very low mg2 concentrations in two hot spring waters probably indicate that they were mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir and not affected by seawater intrusion again afterwards relatively high mg2 concentration in the hot spring water closest to the coastline likely indicates that it was mixed with seawater again during the ascent from the geothermal reservoir the geochemical modeling performed with phreeqc indicates that dolomitization of calcite and precipitation of anhydrite were the dominant water rock interactions for the seawater contaminated hot spring waters keywords hot spring

problem in coastal aquifers basser et al 2019 martinez moreno et al 2017 singh 2014 torres martinez et al 2019 relatively less studies hao et al 2020 kanellopoulos et al 2020 purnomo et al 2016 have been done focusing on its influence on hot springs especially none has been studied on determining the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion at seawater contaminated hot springs which is important to understand the formation process of the hot springs and to protect geothermal resources in coastal aquifers effectively hydrochemical composition can be a powerful tracer of a thermal water in high temperature equilibrium which is the reason that most geothermometers can 2002 fournier 1977 fournier and truesdell 1973 giggenbach 1984 1988 verma and santoyo 1997 are based on concentrations of some chemical components in thermal waters magnesium which is abundant in seawater has been considered to have strong dependence on the temperature of thermal discharges being characterized by low concentrations relative to the other dissolved cations fournier and potter 1979 giggenbach 1988 therefore we use mg2 concentration to determine whether a hot spring water was mixed with seawater before or after being heated in geothermal reservoir which is a newly proposed idea in this study the korean peninsula is located in the northeastern asia to the east of north china constituting the circum pacific tectonic zone with eastern china and japan it has a geological history of 3600 ma and keeps a complicated tectonic record zhai et al 2019 during the mesozoic to the cenozoic complex geological structures and terranes were formed by strong tectonic movements in the korean peninsula kim 1996 pak et al 2009 which complicated hydrogeological conditions however in the northern korean peninsula no investigation results were reported on the hydrogeological issues including groundwaters and hot springs the anak sinchon uplift is a medium high temperature geothermal field situated in a coastal area of the northern korean peninsula more than ten hot springs were found in and around the uplift which have been used for the therapeutic and recreational purposes for hundreds of years some of them have been considered to be affected by seawater intrusion however detailed influences of seawater intrusion on the hot springs i e spatial variations in chemical compositions formation processes and water rock interactions after mixing with seawater are still unknown therefore this paper aims to 1 investigate hydrochemistry of the hot springs in and around the anak sinchon uplift korean peninsula 2 assess geothermometry of the hot springs 3 evaluate the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion and 4 decipher water rock interactions for the seawater contaminated hot spring waters 2 study area 2 1 geological background the anak sinchon uplift is situated in the southwestern part of the phyongnam basin fig 1 the phyongnam basin is a sedimentary basin formed on the archean paleoproterozoic basement which is exposed at some places in the basin including the anak sinchon uplift the uplift was formed by a strong tectonic movement accompanied with granite intrusion in the triassic two nw se trending faults form the boundary of the uplift in the middle jurassic a new tectonic movement started with faulting and folding by the fault block movement the archean paleoproterozoic basement was upheaved and large scale fractures developed the granitic magma rose along these fractures and then intruded into sedimentary rocks the magma froze solid underground and formed granite bodies where the sedimentary rocks were metamorphosed under high temperature condition paek and ju 1996 pak et al 2009 as shown in the geological map fig 1b the precambrian metasedimentary rocks and the mesozoic intrusive rocks occupy the most terrain of the study area the stratigraphic column and main rock types of the precambrian metasedimentary rocks in the study area are shown in fig s1 hot springs in and around the uplift have been considered to be flow out from the fractured aquifer system in the jurassic granites which are composed of quartz k feldspar plagioclase and biotite ri et al 1996 zhai et al 2016 the mesoproterozoic rocks quartzite limestone dolostone and dolomitic limestone predominately composed of quartz calcite and dolomite are mainly developed on the coast and extend to the seabed in the study area kim and jon 1996 zhai et al 2019 2 2 locations of the hot springs and hydrogeology the locations of ten hot springs with temperatures higher than 45 c in the study area are plotted in fig 1b nine of them are located in south hwanghae province while the other hot spring ry is located in nampo city the majority of the hot springs are situated at the fringes of the granites which form large batholiths in and around the uplift as shown in the land use map fig s2 the study area is mainly covered with forest dry field and paddy field and solar salterns on the coast at some places the ta sa po and pa hot springs are situated at the foot of hills and the other hot springs are located in the field there are no large residential areas mines or factories near the hot springs a solar saltern exists on the coast at a distance of 2 7 km from the ry hot spring the hydrogeological conditions of each hot spring site are listed in table s1 each hot spring site consists of several natural springs and or wells at a distance of 100 m from each other extensive occurrences of intrusive rocks and faults were the common geological characteristics the faults in the vicinity of the hot springs seemed to act as the passage for the ascent of confined thermal groundwaters from the deep aquifer at five hot spring sites so ta on po and yo thermal waters were discharged as natural springs flowing out from the fractures in exposed intrusive rocks bubbling waters at high temperature 99 5 100 c were observed from all the outlets at the on hot spring site thermal waters were discharged from artesian wells drilled into the exposed granites at the sa and uc hot spring sites and from pumping wells drilled into the exposed gneiss at the si hot spring site at the ry and pa hot spring sites thermal waters were discharged from artesian wells drilled through quaternary sediments into the bedrock where the thicknesses of sediment layers were less than 10 m in both cases screened intervals of the wells ranged from 0 5 to 2 m since all the hot springs flow out of the exposed rocks or artesian pumping wells drilled into bedrocks the influence of anthropogenic activities including cultivation and pollution on the chemical compositions of the hot springs seems to be negligible 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and measuring water samplings from ten hot spring sites were performed from april to june in 2018 water samples were collected from one natural spring or well which discharged the largest amount of thermal water at each hot spring site table s1 and stored in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles temperatures of the water samples were measured in situ by a htc dt 1 digital thermometer which contains a stainless steel sensor probe with the measuring range of 50 c to 300 c the ph values were measured by a portable ph meter in the field k and na concentrations were determined by the flame photometer detection limit of 0 1 mg l ca2 and mg2 by edta titration detection limit of 0 1 mg l hco3 and co3 2 by hcl titration detection limit of 2 mg l cl and so4 2 by the ion chromatography detection limit of 4 and 18 µg l respectively and sio2 aq by the molybdosilicate method accompanied with the spectrophotometer detection limit of 1 mg l all the sampling and testing procedures were performed based on the standard methods for the examination of water baird et al 2017 3 2 geothermometers the geothermometer is a hydrogeochemical tool to estimate the temperature of the geothermal reservoir based on the assumption that chemical equilibrium between the thermal water and minerals of the reservoir rocks has been attained lambrakis et al 2013 for now classical geothermometers including silica and cation na k k mg and na k ca geothermometers are still the most commonly used tools to estimate reservoir temperature because they are relatively accurate and convenient li et al 2018 na k ca geothermometer is suitable for low temperature 100 c thermal waters fournier 1977 whereas na k and k mg geothermometers can be used for estimating the equilibrium of thermal waters giggenbach 1988 therefore na k k mg and silica geothermometers eqs 1 5 were used to evaluate the temperatures of the geothermal reservoir in this study na k geothermometer giggenbach 1988 1 t na k c 1390 1 75 lg na k 273 15 k mg geothermometer giggenbach 1988 2 t k mg c 4410 14 0 lg k 2 mg 273 15 quartz no steam loss geothermometer fournier 1977 3 t qn c

interpolation methods tps is better under the application condition of large spatial scale and low sampling proportion liao et al 2018 and is approximately as accurate as kriging but enables us to avoid variogram modeling hutchinson and gessler 1994 the tps is based on the assumption that the interpolated surface should not only pass closely to the data points but also be as smooth as possible chen et al 2013 talmi and gilat 1977 which may be suitable for estimating the underground temperature which generally has low spatial variation therefore it was used in this study to interpolate temperatures of geothermal reservoir estimated by the geothermometer tps is a smoothest possible surface passing through or closely to all the given points which can be achieved by minimizing the function eq 6 6 y x p z i f x i 2 1 p i f where p is a smoothing parameter between from 0 to 1 xi zi are the data points f x is the desired surface i f is the roughness measure of the surface f talmi and gilat 1977 the interpolated surface f passes through all the given points when the smoothing parameter p is 1 and is a plane when p is 0 which is expressed as eq 7 7 f x i r i x x i where ri and αi are radial basis functions and their weights respectively practically the tps interpolation in this study was performed by matlab online with the curve fitting toolbox by setting the smoothing parameter p as 1 the matlab code for the tps interpolation of geothermal reservoir temperature is presented in table s2 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry chemical compositions measured from the hot springs in and around the anak sinchon uplift are listed in table 1 the relative error of ion balance was 5 in each case all the hot springs were near neutral to weakly alkaline ph value was 6 9 at the yo hot spring and greater than 7 0 at the other hot springs and was up to 9 0 at the so and sa hot springs na was the dominant cation in all cases cl was the dominant anion in the on uc pa yo and ry hot spring waters while hco3 was the dominant one in the po si sa ta and so hot spring waters high tds total dissolved solids value of 25300 mg l was found at the ry hot spring mg2 concentrations were very low 2 5 mg l in most hot spring waters except the ry hot spring the piper diagram fig 2 shows two hydrochemical groups na cl type square symbol in the on uc pa yo and ry hot springs and na hco3 type circle symbol in the po si sa ta and so hot springs the na cl type hot springs being located close to the coastline were characterized by higher tds values lower ph values and higher temperatures than the na hco3 type hot springs far away from the coastline the five na hco3 type hot springs were similar in chemical compositions principal component analysis pca was performed to establish a classification of hydrochemical parameters of the hot springs cumulative percentage of the first two principal components was 90 24 in the pca biplot fig 3 tds value and concentrations of sio2 aq and most major ions except hco3 and co3 2 are located on the positive side of comp 1 accounting for 70 64 of the variance indicating that the comp 1 is mainly related to tds value on the other hand ph value and concentrations of hco3 and co3 2 are placed on the positive side of comp 2 accounting for 19 60 representing the positive correlation between the ph value and carbonate bicarbonate concentrations due to the carbonate equilibrium in neutral slightly alkaline waters the temperature and sio2 aq concentration on the negative side of comp 2 indicates a positive correlation between them which may be due to the fact that sio2 aq concentration reflects the temperature of a geothermal reservoir fournier 1977 the on yo pa and uc hot springs are placed on the negative side of comp 2 representing their relatively high temperatures the ry hot spring has high score of comp 1 mainly due to its high tds value the five na hco3 type hot springs are placed on the negative side of comp 1 and the positive side of comp 2 indicating their low tds values relatively low temperatures and high ph values 4 2 contamination by seawater it is remarkable that tds values and concentrations of na k ca2 cl and so4 2 in the hot springs near the coast showed decreasing trends with the distance from the coastline while ph values and concentrations of hco3 and co3 2 showed increasing trends figs 4 and 5 these characteristics were probably due to the seawater intrusion which enriches na cl and the other major ions rather than hco3 and co3 2 in the hot springs near the coast the end member mixing analysis can be applied to analyze the mixing of groundwater liu and yamanaka 2012 this method assumes that a groundwater is a mixture of two or more sources or end members and the fractions can be estimated from the hydrochemical compositions of the water samples olea olea et al 2020a the method typically requires the use of conservative species in the water christophersen and hooper 1992 olea olea et al 2020a cl is a conservative ion which is hardly adsorbed onto sediments or precipitated as minerals barhoum et al 2014 tremosa et al 2020 zghibi et al 2013 and dominantly supplied from seawater in the korean coastal aquifers park et al 2012 therefore it has been used as a proxy to indicate seawater encroachment in the korean peninsula kwon et al 2020 ju et al 2021 assuming a hot spring water is a mixture of seawater and freshwater the seawater fraction can be calculated from the cl concentration by eq 8 gimenez forcada 2014 kwon et al 2020 8 f s c cl m i x c cl f c cl s c cl f where f s is the seawater fraction in the mixture c cl m i x c cl f and c cl s are cl concentrations in the mixture freshwater and seawater respectively by using the c cl f value in table 1 the seawater fraction was estimated to be 77 8 in the ry hot spring water indicating that it was a seawater dominated mixture the seawater fractions were estimated to be 14 8 and 7 43 in the on and yo hot spring waters respectively illustrating that they were freshwater dominated mixtures fig s3 the remained seven hot springs were hardly considered to be contaminated by seawater seawater fraction f s 2 4 3 temperature of the geothermal reservoirs temperatures calculated by different geothermometers are shown in table s3 and fig 6 though the geothermometers yielded different values from one another they except na k geothermometer showed decreasing trends in the descending order of water temperature and similar results were obtained by three silica geothermometers in all cases the highest temperatures were estimated by na k geothermometer except at the ry hot spring while the lowest temperatures were obtained by k mg geothermometer likely due to the characteristics of the cation geothermometers the na k geothermometer readjusts slowly in the cool environments encountered by rising waters which is less affected by mixing with shallow waters and generally indicates temperatures of deep equilibration but the k mg geothermometer is very sensitive to cooling and admixing of shallow waters mimi et al 1998 the giggenbach na k mg diagram giggenbach 1988 was used to identify the water rock equilibrium of the thermal water qiu et al 2018 yang et al 2017 and to assess the reliability of the temperatures estimated by na k and k mg geothermometers as shown in fig 7 all the hot spring waters belonged to partially equilibrated waters or immature waters moreover except the on hot spring the compositions of other hot springs fell far from the full equilibrium curve indicating that na k and k mg geothermometers were inappropriate for those nine hot springs since temperatures estimated by those cation geothermometers are only reliable when water composition falls on or near the full equilibrium curve of the giggenbach na k mg diagram giggenbach 1988 romano and liotta 2020 only the composition of the on hot spring water 100 c fell near to the full equilibrium curve in the diagram indicating that it was in a near equilibrium state furthermore all the geothermometers including three silica geothermometers yielded temperatures within a relatively small range of 138 153 c at the on hot spring fig 6 suggesting that these estimation results probably approximated to the actual temperature of the geothermal reservoir under the on hot spring for the remaining nine hot springs in non equilibrium states silica geothermometers may provide more reliable results than cation geothermometers baioumy et al 2015 wu et al 2021 furthermore the improved silica geothermometer was validated for saline water samples verma and santoyo 1997 accordingly the geothermometer could be the best option for all the hot springs including the on hot spring the temperatures of geothermal reservoir estimated by the improved silica geothermometer ranged from 103 to 170 c in the study area which were interpolated by thin plate spline to predict the local trend of temperature distribution according to the contour map of reservoir temperature distribution fig 8 the temperature of the geothermal reservoir is probably relatively low under the middle of the uplift but high under the northern and the southern fringe of the uplift near the coast fig 8 also shows a n s trending ridge represented as the dotted line passing close to the ry uc so and on hot springs the line is approximately matched with the distribution of jurassic granites in the western part of the uplift where is considered to have high geothermal potential 4 4 the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion as mentioned in section 4 1 mg2 concentrations were very low 2 5 mg l in most hot springs of our study even in the seawater contaminated hot springs except the ry hot spring table 1 fig 5d probably due to the geochemical behavior of mg2 in geothermal waters magnesium is abundant in seawater 1280 mg l and is one of the major cations of non geothermal groundwater but its concentration in geothermal waters tends to decrease by water rock interactions under high temperature conditions especially in neutral to slightly alkaline waters arnórsson 1978 ellis 1971 fournier and potter 1979 giggenbach 1988 guo et al 2019 at the reykjanes peninsula iceland where seawater reacted with basalt at about 270 285 c mg2 concentration decreased from 1272 to l 0 mg l arnórsson 1978 ellis 1971 found mg2 concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 1 mg l at 200 c and from 0 02 to 0 05 mg l at 300 c in laboratory experiments in which chlorite calcite and quartz were equilibrated with water guo et al 2019 found that the na cl fluids from a deep well drilled in the yangbajain geothermal field of china had low mg2 concentrations 0 01 mg l or less which was described as the result of full equilibrium with reservoir minerals under high temperature conditions previous works ascribed the depletion in mg2 in high temperature geothermal waters to the chloritization or dolomitization which is discussed in detail in section 4 5 therefore we suggest that mg2 concentration could be an important evidence to determine whether a seawater contaminated hot spring water at neutral to slightly alkaline ph was mixed with seawater before or after being heated in the geothermal reservoir the theoretical concentration of a chemical component in a seawater freshwater mixture can be calculated from the seawater fraction as eq 9 gimenez forcada 2014 pulido leboeuf 2004 9 c i m i x 1 f s c i f f s c i s where f s is the seawater fraction in the mixture c i m i x c i f and c i s are the concentrations of the chemical component in the mixture freshwater and seawater respectively depletion in observed mg2 relative to the theoretical concentration calculated from the seawater fraction probably indicates that the hot spring water was mixed with seawater before being heated in geothermal reservoir a very low mg2 concentration lower than or close to that of freshwater observed at a seawater contaminated hot spring indicates that the hot spring water was not mixed with seawater again after being heated in geothermal reservoir a relatively high mg2 concentration probably indicates that the temperature of geothermal reservoir is relatively low fournier and potter 1979 or the hot spring water was mixed with seawater again after being heated in the geothermal reservoir no obvious depletion in mg2 after mixing with seawater likely indicates that the mixing occurred during the ascent from the geothermal reservoir mg2 concentrations observed in the on and yo hot spring waters were very low 1 3 mg l much lower than the calculated concentrations and even lower than that of freshwater fig 9 therefore it can be assumed that these two hot spring waters were mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir and not affected by seawater intrusion again afterwards at the ry hot spring though observed mg2 concentration was relatively high 213 mg l it showed a depletion as well relative to the calculated concentration therefore this hot spring also seemed to have been mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir relatively high mg2 concentration in this spring water was probably attributed to the mixing with seawater after being equilibrated in the geothermal reservoir instead of the low temperature of the geothermal reservoir since the improved silica geothermometer which was validated for saline waters yielded the highest temperature at the ry hot spring fig 6 consequently the ry hot spring which is only 2 7 km from the coastline was probably mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir and mixed with seawater again during the ascent from there 4 5 water rock interactions for seawater contaminated hot spring waters in order to decipher water rock interactions for the seawater contaminated hot spring waters k na ca2 and so4 2 concentrations observed in the hot spring waters were compared with the theoretical concentrations calculated by eq 9 enrichments in observed ca2 relative to the calculated concentrations were commonly found in the seawater contaminated hot spring waters table 2 suggesting other supply sources of ca2 in addition to the seawater component considering that ca2 concentrations in the freshwater hot springs were relatively low 20 mg l additional ca2 would not have been supplied from freshwater component but by water rock interactions after mixing with seawater as mentioned in section 2 1 mesoproterozoic limestone dolostone and dolomitic limestone are largely developed on the coast and extend to the seabed therefore calcite was probably the predominant supply source of the additional ca2 in the seawater contaminated waters romanov and dreybrodt 2006 vengosh and rosenthal 1994 slight depletions in k and na after mixing with seawater were found in the three hot springs especially in the ry hot spring table 2 which was likely due to k ca2 and na ca2 cation exchanges often observed in the korean peninsula kim et al 2018 kwon et al 2020 as mentioned in section 4 4 depletion in mg2 in thermal waters has been ascribed to chloritization ellis 1971 giggenbach 1988 guo et al 2019 or dolomitization etschmann et al 2014 lovering 1969 schrijver et al 1996 warren 2000 chloritization generally cause mg2 na or mg2 k cation exchange giggenbach 1988 while dolomitization of calcite enriches ca2 by the reaction eq 10 10 2caco3 mg2 camg co3 2 ca2 this is consistent with the fact that ca2 was enriched by water rock interactions in our cases consequently it can be inferred that dolomitization of calcite was the dominant water rock interaction causing the enrichment in ca2 and the depletion in mg2 in the seawater contaminated hot spring waters the so4 2 concentrations observed in the three hot spring waters were substantially lower relative to the calculated concentrations table 2 the depletion in so4 2 in seawater contaminated waters has been ascribed to the microbial reduction chapelle and mcmahon 1991 singaraja et al 2015 or the precipitation of caso4 minerals i e anhydrite and gypsum boluda botella et al 2008 gomis yagues et al 2000 hovland et al 2018 kuhn et al 2003 singaraja et al 2015 considering that high temperatures 100 c of the geothermal reservoir are unfavorable for the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria george et al 2008 it is reasonable to infer that high temperature condition high so4 2 concentration from seawater and the enrichment in ca2 triggered the precipitation of caso4 marshall et al 1964 power et al 1966 which led to the depletion in so4 2 furthermore though both gypsum and anhydrite have retrograde solubilities anhydrite has a lower solubility than gypsum at high temperatures 50 c hovland et al 2018 power et al 1966 and firstly precipitates from seawater by heating hovland et al 2018 kuhn et al 2003 while gypsum in contact with a saline water is converted to natural anhydrite at temperatures above 90 5 c ostroff 1964 accordingly precipitation of anhydrite triggered by the enrichment in ca2 and the increase in temperature was probably the dominant water rock interaction which caused the depletion in so4 2 in the seawater contaminated hot spring waters the changes in chemical compositions of the hot spring waters after being mixed with seawater can be summarized as the enrichment in ca2 depletions in mg2 and so4 2 and slight depletions in k and na from the local geology section 2 1 the main flow paths of the seawater contaminated hot spring waters occur in the mesoproterozoic rocks on the seabed predominately composed of quartz calcite and dolomite kim and jon 1996 zhai et al 2019 and the jurassic granites according to the experiment of savage et al 1993 when granites composed of quartz k feldspar plagioclase muscovite and biotite reacted with the seawater at 200 c 50 mpa the principal changes in the fluid chemistry were depletions in ca2 and so4 2 which were also observed in heating seawater without granite and ascribed to the precipitation of anhydrite a slight depletion in mg2 and an enrichment of sio2 aq therefore the dominant changes in chemical compositions of the hot spring waters probably occurred in the mesoproterozoic rocks or the contact zone with them in the geothermal reservoir to verify the above mentioned geochemical processes geochemical modelings were performed with phreeqc 3 7 0 by using pitzer database which was developed for high salinity waters gil marquez et al 2017 parkhurst and appelo 2013 forward reaction modeling was performed on the on hot spring water which was found as near equilibrated water in section 4 3 in the modeling the calculated ion concentrations in the hot spring water were used as the initial solution composition the water mass of the initial solution was set to 0 995 kg and the volume of the solution was adjusted to be 1 0 l the initial temperature was set to 20 c and reaction temperature steps from 21 to 143 c with the interval of 2 c were added and the final equilibrium temperature was set to 143 7 c which was the temperature of geothermal reservoir estimated at the on hot spring the reaction pressure was set to 10 mpa from the mineral compositions of mesoproterozoic rocks where the dominant water rock interaction occurred 1 mol of quartz calcite and dolomite were selected as equilibrium phases considering our assumptions of caso4 minerals precipitation and cation exchanges by ca2 anhydrite and gypsum were selected as product phases with initial amount of 0 mol and 10 mmol of cax2 was selected as the initial exchange species as the water temperature rose to 123 c ca2 and mg2 concentrations gradually increased and decreased respectively accompanied with the increase in dolomite and the decrease in calcite fig s4 showing the characteristics of dolomitization process above 123 c these trends were continued in mg2 concentration dolomite and calcite but ca2 concentration decreased accompanied with the decrease in so4 2 and the increase in anhydrite indicating the precipitation of anhydrite instead of the precipitation of gypsum concentrations of k and na decreased at low temperature steps and did not change significantly at high temperature steps indicating that k ca2 and na ca2 cation exchanges mainly occurred under normal temperatures the increase in sio2 aq with the decrease in quartz and the decrease in hco3 represent the dissolution of quartz and co2 emission respectively which are the common processes in the equilibration of thermal waters giggenbach 1984 inverse modeling was performed on the seawater contaminated hot spring waters to identify hydrogeochemical processes quantitively olea olea et al 2020b plummer et al 1983 the calculated and observed concentrations in the hot spring waters were set as the initial and final solution compositions respectively and the solution volumes were adjusted to be 1 l anhydrite calcite dolomite quartz cax2 kx nax and co2 g were selected as the phases for the modeling the balances of each component and uncertainties were set to 0 01 the modeling results are listed in table 3 in all cases only one model was found for the water rock interactions by the inverse modeling every model commonly shows mole transfers from calcite quartz and cax2 to the solution and from the solution to anhydrite dolomite kx nax and co2 g the molar ratios of decreased calcite to increased dolomite were 1 96 1 91 and 1 99 at the on yo and ry hot springs respectively commonly indicating the dolomitization of calcite the mole transfers from the on and yo hot spring water to kx were 0 33 and 0 03 mmol respectively which were so small that the k ca2 cation exchange could be negligible at the on and yo hot springs the amounts of na ca2 cation exchange 1 6 and 3 43 mmol l respectively were more than those of k ca2 cation exchange but not so big relative to na concentrations in the two hot spring waters table 2 at the ry hot spring 4 7 mmol l of k and 97 4 mmol l of na were exchanged by ca2 indicating that na ca2 cation exchange was one of the dominant water rock interactions as well the amounts of precipitated anhydrite were 3 16 1 59 and 17 1 mmol at the on yo and ry hot springs respectively which were approximately proportional to the seawater fractions in the solutions 5 conclusions ten hot springs in and around the anak sinchon uplift of the korean peninsula were differently influenced by seawater intrusion depending on their location tds value and concentrations of na k ca2 cl and so4 2 in the hot spring waters near the coast showed decreasing trends with the distance from the coastline three hot springs near the coast were considered to be contaminated by seawater seawater fractions were estimated to be 77 8 14 8 and 7 43 at the ry on and yo hot springs respectively the other hot springs were not considered to be contaminated by seawater according to the improved silica geothermometer and tps interpolation the western part of the anak sinchon uplift had high geothermal potential with the temperatures of geothermal reservoir from 103 to 170 c in this study mg2 concentration was used to determine the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion at seawater contaminated hot spring waters the on and yo hot spring waters were probably mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir and not affected by seawater intrusion again afterwards while the ry hot spring water was probably mixed both before and after being heated in the geothermal reservoir by comparing with the calculated concentrations enrichments in observed ca2 and depletions in observed mg2 and so4 2 were commonly found at three seawater contaminated hot springs depletions in k and na after mixing with seawater were obvious in the ry hot spring water the equilibrium modeling results show that when a seawater freshwater mixture was equilibrated at high temperature in contact with calcite quartz and cax2 water rock interactions such as dolomitization of calcite precipitation of anhydrite dissolution of quartz and k ca2 and na ca2 cation exchanges would occur the inverse modeling results show that dolomitization of calcite and precipitation of anhydrite were the dominant water rock interactions for the seawater contaminated hot spring waters in the study area the results of this study may be helpful to extend

distribution mg2 concentration was used to determine the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion among the three seawater contaminated hot springs very low mg2 concentrations in two hot spring waters probably indicate that they were mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir and not affected by seawater intrusion again afterwards relatively high mg2

faults hernández antonio et al 2015 qiu et al 2018 yang et al 2019 there are many investigations on the sources and geneses of hot springs for sustainable development for different purposes showing that hot spring waters mostly obtain heat from deep aquifers and get chemicals along the flow path from deep ground to the surface or pumping wells chen et al 2021 lee et al 2011 yang et al 2017 along the flow path intensive water rock interactions and mixing occur which complicate geochemical processes of hot springs guo et al 2020 xu et al 1998 therefore it is challenging to decipher geochemical processes of the hot springs many hot springs occur around coastal areas which may be affected by seawater via mixing knappett et al 2018 although seawater intrusion is an increasingly widespread problem in coastal aquifers basser et al 2019 martinez moreno et al 2017 singh 2014 torres martinez et al 2019 relatively less studies hao et al 2020 kanellopoulos et al 2020 purnomo et al 2016 have been done focusing on its influence on hot springs especially none has been studied on determining the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion at seawater contaminated hot springs which is important to understand the formation process of the hot springs and to protect geothermal resources in coastal aquifers effectively hydrochemical composition can be a powerful tracer of a thermal water in high temperature equilibrium which is the reason that most geothermometers can 2002 fournier 1977 fournier and truesdell 1973 giggenbach 1984 1988 verma and santoyo 1997 are based on concentrations of some chemical components in thermal waters magnesium which is abundant in seawater has been considered to have strong dependence on the temperature of thermal discharges being characterized by low concentrations relative to the other dissolved cations fournier and potter 1979 giggenbach 1988 therefore we use mg2 concentration to determine whether a hot spring water was mixed with seawater before or after being heated in geothermal reservoir which is a newly proposed idea in this study the korean peninsula is located in the northeastern asia to the east of north china constituting the circum pacific tectonic zone with eastern china and japan it has a geological history of 3600 ma and keeps a complicated tectonic record zhai et al 2019 during the mesozoic to the cenozoic complex geological structures and terranes were formed by strong tectonic movements in the korean peninsula kim 1996 pak et al 2009 which complicated hydrogeological conditions however in the northern korean peninsula no investigation results were reported on the hydrogeological issues including groundwaters and hot springs the anak sinchon uplift is a medium high temperature geothermal field situated in a coastal area of the northern korean peninsula more than ten hot springs were found in and around the uplift which have been used for the therapeutic and recreational purposes for hundreds of years some of them have been considered to be affected by seawater intrusion however detailed influences of seawater intrusion on the hot springs i e spatial variations in chemical compositions formation processes and water rock interactions after mixing with seawater are still unknown therefore this paper aims to 1 investigate hydrochemistry of the hot springs in and around the anak sinchon uplift korean peninsula 2 assess geothermometry of the hot springs 3 evaluate the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion and 4 decipher water rock interactions for the seawater contaminated hot spring waters 2 study area 2 1 geological background the anak sinchon uplift is situated in the southwestern part of the phyongnam basin fig 1 the phyongnam basin is a sedimentary basin formed on the archean paleoproterozoic basement which is exposed at some places in the basin including the anak sinchon uplift the uplift was formed by a strong tectonic movement accompanied with granite intrusion in the triassic two nw se trending faults form the boundary of the uplift in the middle jurassic a new tectonic movement started with faulting and folding by the fault block movement the archean paleoproterozoic basement was upheaved and large scale fractures developed the granitic magma rose along these fractures and then intruded into sedimentary rocks the magma froze solid underground and formed granite bodies where the sedimentary rocks were metamorphosed under high temperature condition paek and ju 1996 pak et al 2009 as shown in the geological map fig 1b the precambrian metasedimentary rocks and the mesozoic intrusive rocks occupy the most terrain of the study area the stratigraphic column and main rock types of the precambrian metasedimentary rocks in the study area are shown in fig s1 hot springs in and around the uplift have been considered to be flow out from the fractured aquifer system in the jurassic granites which are composed of quartz k feldspar plagioclase and biotite ri et al 1996 zhai et al 2016 the mesoproterozoic rocks quartzite limestone dolostone and dolomitic limestone predominately composed of quartz calcite and dolomite are mainly developed on the coast and extend to the seabed in the study area kim and jon 1996 zhai et al 2019 2 2 locations of the hot springs and hydrogeology the locations of ten hot springs with temperatures higher than 45 c in the study area are plotted in fig 1b nine of them are located in south hwanghae province while the other hot spring ry is located in nampo city the majority of the hot springs are situated at the fringes of the granites which form large batholiths in and around the uplift as shown in the land use map fig s2 the study area is mainly covered with forest dry field and paddy field and solar salterns on the coast at some places the ta sa po and pa hot springs are situated at the foot of hills and the other hot springs are located in the field there are no large residential areas mines or factories near the hot springs a solar saltern exists on the coast at a distance of 2 7 km from the ry hot spring the hydrogeological conditions of each hot spring site are listed in table s1 each hot spring site consists of several natural springs and or wells at a distance of 100 m from each other extensive occurrences of intrusive rocks and faults were the common geological characteristics the faults in the vicinity of the hot springs seemed to act as the passage for the ascent of confined thermal groundwaters from the deep aquifer at five hot spring sites so ta on po and yo thermal waters were discharged as natural springs flowing out from the fractures in exposed intrusive rocks bubbling waters at high temperature 99 5 100 c were observed from all the outlets at the on hot spring site thermal waters were discharged from artesian wells drilled into the exposed granites at the sa and uc hot spring sites and from pumping wells drilled into the exposed gneiss at the si hot spring site at the ry and pa hot spring sites thermal waters were discharged from artesian wells drilled through quaternary sediments into the bedrock where the thicknesses of sediment layers were less than 10 m in both cases screened intervals of the wells ranged from 0 5 to 2 m since all the hot springs flow out of the exposed rocks or artesian pumping wells drilled into bedrocks the influence of anthropogenic activities including cultivation and pollution on the chemical compositions of the hot springs seems to be negligible 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and measuring water samplings from ten hot spring sites were performed from april to june in 2018 water samples were collected from one natural spring or well which discharged the largest amount of thermal water at each hot spring site table s1 and stored in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles temperatures of the water samples were measured in situ by a htc dt 1 digital thermometer which contains a stainless steel sensor probe with the measuring range of 50 c to 300 c the ph values were measured by a portable ph meter in the field k and na concentrations were determined by the flame photometer detection limit of 0 1 mg l ca2 and mg2 by edta titration detection limit of 0 1 mg l hco3 and co3 2 by hcl titration detection limit of 2 mg l cl and so4 2 by the ion chromatography detection limit of 4 and 18 µg l respectively and sio2 aq by the molybdosilicate method accompanied with the spectrophotometer detection limit of 1 mg l all the sampling and testing procedures were performed based on the standard methods for the examination of water baird et al 2017 3 2 geothermometers the geothermometer is a hydrogeochemical tool to estimate the temperature of the geothermal reservoir based on the assumption that chemical equilibrium between the thermal water and minerals of the reservoir rocks has been attained lambrakis et al 2013 for now classical geothermometers including silica and cation na k k mg and na k ca geothermometers are still the most commonly used tools to estimate reservoir temperature because they are relatively accurate and convenient li et al 2018 na k ca geothermometer is suitable for low temperature 100 c thermal waters fournier 1977 whereas na k and k mg geothermometers can be used for estimating the equilibrium of thermal waters giggenbach 1988 therefore na k k mg and silica geothermometers eqs 1 5 were used to evaluate the temperatures of the geothermal reservoir in this study na k geothermometer giggenbach 1988 1 t na k c 1390 1 75 lg na k 273 15 k mg geothermometer giggenbach 1988 2 t k mg c 4410 14 0 lg k 2 mg 273 15 quartz no steam loss geothermometer fournier 1977 3 t qn c

interpolation methods tps is better under the application condition of large spatial scale and low sampling proportion liao et al 2018 and is approximately as accurate as kriging but enables us to avoid variogram modeling hutchinson and gessler 1994 the tps is based on the assumption that the interpolated surface should not only pass closely to the data points but also be as smooth as possible chen et al 2013 talmi and gilat 1977 which may be suitable for estimating the underground temperature which generally has low spatial variation therefore it was used in this study to interpolate temperatures of geothermal reservoir estimated by the geothermometer tps is a smoothest possible surface passing through or closely to all the given points which can be achieved by minimizing the function eq 6 6 y x p z i f x i 2 1 p i f where p is a smoothing parameter between from 0 to 1 xi zi are the data points f x is the desired surface i f is the roughness measure of the surface f talmi and gilat 1977 the interpolated surface f passes through all the given points when the smoothing parameter p is 1 and is a plane when p is 0 which is expressed as eq 7 7 f x i r i x x i where ri and αi are radial basis functions and their weights respectively practically the tps interpolation in this study was performed by matlab online with the curve fitting toolbox by setting the smoothing parameter p as 1 the matlab code for the tps interpolation of geothermal reservoir temperature is presented in table s2 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry chemical compositions measured from the hot springs in and around the anak sinchon uplift are listed in table 1 the relative error of ion balance was 5 in each case all the hot springs were near neutral to weakly alkaline ph value was 6 9 at the yo hot spring and greater than 7 0 at the other hot springs and was up to 9 0 at the so and sa hot springs na was the dominant cation in all cases cl was the dominant anion in the on uc pa yo and ry hot spring waters while hco3 was the dominant one in the po si sa ta and so hot spring waters high tds total dissolved solids value of 25300 mg l was found at the ry hot spring mg2 concentrations were very low 2 5 mg l in most hot spring waters except the ry hot spring the piper diagram fig 2 shows two hydrochemical groups na cl type square symbol in the on uc pa yo and ry hot springs and na hco3 type circle symbol in the po si sa ta and so hot springs the na cl type hot springs being located close to the coastline were characterized by higher tds values lower ph values and higher temperatures than the na hco3 type hot springs far away from the coastline the five na hco3 type hot springs were similar in chemical compositions principal component analysis pca was performed to establish a classification of hydrochemical parameters of the hot springs cumulative percentage of the first two principal components was 90 24 in the pca biplot fig 3 tds value and concentrations of sio2 aq and most major ions except hco3 and co3 2 are located on the positive side of comp 1 accounting for 70 64 of the variance indicating that the comp 1 is mainly related to tds value on the other hand ph value and concentrations of hco3 and co3 2 are placed on the positive side of comp 2 accounting for 19 60 representing the positive correlation between the ph value and carbonate bicarbonate concentrations due to the carbonate equilibrium in neutral slightly alkaline waters the temperature and sio2 aq concentration on the negative side of comp 2 indicates a positive correlation between them which may be due to the fact that sio2 aq concentration reflects the temperature of a geothermal reservoir fournier 1977 the on yo pa and uc hot springs are placed on the negative side of comp 2 representing their relatively high temperatures the ry hot spring has high score of comp 1 mainly due to its high tds value the five na hco3 type hot springs are placed on the negative side of comp 1 and the positive side of comp 2 indicating their low tds values relatively low temperatures and high ph values 4 2 contamination by seawater it is remarkable that tds values and concentrations of na k ca2 cl and so4 2 in the hot springs near the coast showed decreasing trends with the distance from the coastline while ph values and concentrations of hco3 and co3 2 showed increasing trends figs 4 and 5 these characteristics were probably due to the seawater intrusion which enriches na cl and the other major ions rather than hco3 and co3 2 in the hot springs near the coast the end member mixing analysis can be applied to analyze the mixing of groundwater liu and yamanaka 2012 this method assumes that a groundwater is a mixture of two or more sources or end members and the fractions can be estimated from the hydrochemical compositions of the water samples olea olea et al 2020a the method typically requires the use of conservative species in the water christophersen and hooper 1992 olea olea et al 2020a cl is a conservative ion which is hardly adsorbed onto sediments or precipitated as minerals barhoum et al 2014 tremosa et al 2020 zghibi et al 2013 and dominantly supplied from seawater in the korean coastal aquifers park et al 2012 therefore it has been used as a proxy to indicate seawater encroachment in the korean peninsula kwon et al 2020 ju et al 2021 assuming a hot spring water is a mixture of seawater and freshwater the seawater fraction can be calculated from the cl concentration by eq 8 gimenez forcada 2014 kwon et al 2020 8 f s c cl m i x c cl f c cl s c cl f where f s is the seawater fraction in the mixture c cl m i x c cl f and c cl s are cl concentrations in the mixture freshwater and seawater respectively by using the c cl f value in table 1 the seawater fraction was estimated to be 77 8 in the ry hot spring water indicating that it was a seawater dominated mixture the seawater fractions were estimated to be 14 8 and 7 43 in the on and yo hot spring waters respectively illustrating that they were freshwater dominated mixtures fig s3 the remained seven hot springs were hardly considered to be contaminated by seawater seawater fraction f s 2 4 3 temperature of the geothermal reservoirs temperatures calculated by different geothermometers are shown in table s3 and fig 6 though the geothermometers yielded different values from one another they except na k geothermometer showed decreasing trends in the descending order of water temperature and similar results were obtained by three silica geothermometers in all cases the highest temperatures were estimated by na k geothermometer except at the ry hot spring while the lowest temperatures were obtained by k mg geothermometer likely due to the characteristics of the cation geothermometers the na k geothermometer readjusts slowly in the cool environments encountered by rising waters which is less affected by mixing with shallow waters and generally indicates temperatures of deep equilibration but the k mg geothermometer is very sensitive to cooling and admixing of shallow waters mimi et al 1998 the giggenbach na k mg diagram giggenbach 1988 was used to identify the water rock equilibrium of the thermal water qiu et al 2018 yang et al 2017 and to assess the reliability of the temperatures estimated by na k and k mg geothermometers as shown in fig 7 all the hot spring waters belonged to partially equilibrated waters or immature waters moreover except the on hot spring the compositions of other hot springs fell far from the full equilibrium curve indicating that na k and k mg geothermometers were inappropriate for those nine hot springs since temperatures estimated by those cation geothermometers are only reliable when water composition falls on or near the full equilibrium curve of the giggenbach na k mg diagram giggenbach 1988 romano and liotta 2020 only the composition of the on hot spring water 100 c fell near to the full equilibrium curve in the diagram indicating that it was in a near equilibrium state furthermore all the geothermometers including three silica geothermometers yielded temperatures within a relatively small range of 138 153 c at the on hot spring fig 6 suggesting that these estimation results probably approximated to the actual temperature of the geothermal reservoir under the on hot spring for the remaining nine hot springs in non equilibrium states silica geothermometers may provide more reliable results than cation geothermometers baioumy et al 2015 wu et al 2021 furthermore the improved silica geothermometer was validated for saline water samples verma and santoyo 1997 accordingly the geothermometer could be the best option for all the hot springs including the on hot spring the temperatures of geothermal reservoir estimated by the improved silica geothermometer ranged from 103 to 170 c in the study area which were interpolated by thin plate spline to predict the local trend of temperature distribution according to the contour map of reservoir temperature distribution fig 8 the temperature of the geothermal reservoir is probably relatively low under the middle of the uplift but high under the northern and the southern fringe of the uplift near the coast fig 8 also shows a n s trending ridge represented as the dotted line passing close to the ry uc so and on hot springs the line is approximately matched with the distribution of jurassic granites in the western part of the uplift where is considered to have high geothermal potential 4 4 the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion as mentioned in section 4 1 mg2 concentrations were very low 2 5 mg l in most hot springs of our study even in the seawater contaminated hot springs except the ry hot spring table 1 fig 5d probably due to the geochemical behavior of mg2 in geothermal waters magnesium is abundant in seawater 1280 mg l and is one of the major cations of non geothermal groundwater but its concentration in geothermal waters tends to decrease by water rock interactions under high temperature conditions especially in neutral to slightly alkaline waters arnórsson 1978 ellis 1971 fournier and potter 1979 giggenbach 1988 guo et al 2019 at the reykjanes peninsula iceland where seawater reacted with basalt at about 270 285 c mg2 concentration decreased from 1272 to l 0 mg l arnórsson 1978 ellis 1971 found mg2 concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 1 mg l at 200 c and from 0 02 to 0 05 mg l at 300 c in laboratory experiments in which chlorite calcite and quartz were equilibrated with water guo et al 2019 found that the na cl fluids from a deep well drilled in the yangbajain geothermal field of china had low mg2 concentrations 0 01 mg l or less which was described as the result of full equilibrium with reservoir minerals under high temperature conditions previous works ascribed the depletion in mg2 in high temperature geothermal waters to the chloritization or dolomitization which is discussed in detail in section 4 5 therefore we suggest that mg2 concentration could be an important evidence to determine whether a seawater contaminated hot spring water at neutral to slightly alkaline ph was mixed with seawater before or after being heated in the geothermal reservoir the theoretical concentration of a chemical component in a seawater freshwater mixture can be calculated from the seawater fraction as eq 9 gimenez forcada 2014 pulido leboeuf 2004 9 c i m i x 1 f s c i f f s c i s where f s is the seawater fraction in the mixture c i m i x c i f and c i s are the concentrations of the chemical component in the mixture freshwater and seawater respectively depletion in observed mg2 relative to the theoretical concentration calculated from the seawater fraction probably indicates that the hot spring water was mixed with seawater before being heated in geothermal reservoir a very low mg2 concentration lower than or close to that of freshwater observed at a seawater contaminated hot spring indicates that the hot spring water was not mixed with seawater again after being heated in geothermal reservoir a relatively high mg2 concentration probably indicates that the temperature of geothermal reservoir is relatively low fournier and potter 1979 or the hot spring water was mixed with seawater again after being heated in the geothermal reservoir no obvious depletion in mg2 after mixing with seawater likely indicates that the mixing occurred during the ascent from the geothermal reservoir mg2 concentrations observed in the on and yo hot spring waters were very low 1 3 mg l much lower than the calculated concentrations and even lower than that of freshwater fig 9 therefore it can be assumed that these two hot spring waters were mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir and not affected by seawater intrusion again afterwards at the ry hot spring though observed mg2 concentration was relatively high 213 mg l it showed a depletion as well relative to the calculated concentration therefore this hot spring also seemed to have been mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir relatively high mg2 concentration in this spring water was probably attributed to the mixing with seawater after being equilibrated in the geothermal reservoir instead of the low temperature of the geothermal reservoir since the improved silica geothermometer which was validated for saline waters yielded the highest temperature at the ry hot spring fig 6 consequently the ry hot spring which is only 2 7 km from the coastline was probably mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir and mixed with seawater again during the ascent from there 4 5 water rock interactions for seawater contaminated hot spring waters in order to decipher water rock interactions for the seawater contaminated hot spring waters k na ca2 and so4 2 concentrations observed in the hot spring waters were compared with the theoretical concentrations calculated by eq 9 enrichments in observed ca2 relative to the calculated concentrations were commonly found in the seawater contaminated hot spring waters table 2 suggesting other supply sources of ca2 in addition to the seawater component considering that ca2 concentrations in the freshwater hot springs were relatively low 20 mg l additional ca2 would not have been supplied from freshwater component but by water rock interactions after mixing with seawater as mentioned in section 2 1 mesoproterozoic limestone dolostone and dolomitic limestone are largely developed on the coast and extend to the seabed therefore calcite was probably the predominant supply source of the additional ca2 in the seawater contaminated waters romanov and dreybrodt 2006 vengosh and rosenthal 1994 slight depletions in k and na after mixing with seawater were found in the three hot springs especially in the ry hot spring table 2 which was likely due to k ca2 and na ca2 cation exchanges often observed in the korean peninsula kim et al 2018 kwon et al 2020 as mentioned in section 4 4 depletion in mg2 in thermal waters has been ascribed to chloritization ellis 1971 giggenbach 1988 guo et al 2019 or dolomitization etschmann et al 2014 lovering 1969 schrijver et al 1996 warren 2000 chloritization generally cause mg2 na or mg2 k cation exchange giggenbach 1988 while dolomitization of calcite enriches ca2 by the reaction eq 10 10 2caco3 mg2 camg co3 2 ca2 this is consistent with the fact that ca2 was enriched by water rock interactions in our cases consequently it can be inferred that dolomitization of calcite was the dominant water rock interaction causing the enrichment in ca2 and the depletion in mg2 in the seawater contaminated hot spring waters the so4 2 concentrations observed in the three hot spring waters were substantially lower relative to the calculated concentrations table 2 the depletion in so4 2 in seawater contaminated waters has been ascribed to the microbial reduction chapelle and mcmahon 1991 singaraja et al 2015 or the precipitation of caso4 minerals i e anhydrite and gypsum boluda botella et al 2008 gomis yagues et al 2000 hovland et al 2018 kuhn et al 2003 singaraja et al 2015 considering that high temperatures 100 c of the geothermal reservoir are unfavorable for the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria george et al 2008 it is reasonable to infer that high temperature condition high so4 2 concentration from seawater and the enrichment in ca2 triggered the precipitation of caso4 marshall et al 1964 power et al 1966 which led to the depletion in so4 2 furthermore though both gypsum and anhydrite have retrograde solubilities anhydrite has a lower solubility than gypsum at high temperatures 50 c hovland et al 2018 power et al 1966 and firstly precipitates from seawater by heating hovland et al 2018 kuhn et al 2003 while gypsum in contact with a saline water is converted to natural anhydrite at temperatures above 90 5 c ostroff 1964 accordingly precipitation of anhydrite triggered by the enrichment in ca2 and the increase in temperature was probably the dominant water rock interaction which caused the depletion in so4 2 in the seawater contaminated hot spring waters the changes in chemical compositions of the hot spring waters after being mixed with seawater can be summarized as the enrichment in ca2 depletions in mg2 and so4 2 and slight depletions in k and na from the local geology section 2 1 the main flow paths of the seawater contaminated hot spring waters occur in the mesoproterozoic rocks on the seabed predominately composed of quartz calcite and dolomite kim and jon 1996 zhai et al 2019 and the jurassic granites according to the experiment of savage et al 1993 when granites composed of quartz k feldspar plagioclase muscovite and biotite reacted with the seawater at 200 c 50 mpa the principal changes in the fluid chemistry were depletions in ca2 and so4 2 which were also observed in heating seawater without granite and ascribed to the precipitation of anhydrite a slight depletion in mg2 and an enrichment of sio2 aq therefore the dominant changes in chemical compositions of the hot spring waters probably occurred in the mesoproterozoic rocks or the contact zone with them in the geothermal reservoir to verify the above mentioned geochemical processes geochemical modelings were performed with phreeqc 3 7 0 by using pitzer database which was developed for high salinity waters gil marquez et al 2017 parkhurst and appelo 2013 forward reaction modeling was performed on the on hot spring water which was found as near equilibrated water in section 4 3 in the modeling the calculated ion concentrations in the hot spring water were used as the initial solution composition the water mass of the initial solution was set to 0 995 kg and the volume of the solution was adjusted to be 1 0 l the initial temperature was set to 20 c and reaction temperature steps from 21 to 143 c with the interval of 2 c were added and the final equilibrium temperature was set to 143 7 c which was the temperature of geothermal reservoir estimated at the on hot spring the reaction pressure was set to 10 mpa from the mineral compositions of mesoproterozoic rocks where the dominant water rock interaction occurred 1 mol of quartz calcite and dolomite were selected as equilibrium phases considering our assumptions of caso4 minerals precipitation and cation exchanges by ca2 anhydrite and gypsum were selected as product phases with initial amount of 0 mol and 10 mmol of cax2 was selected as the initial exchange species as the water temperature rose to 123 c ca2 and mg2 concentrations gradually increased and decreased respectively accompanied with the increase in dolomite and the decrease in calcite fig s4 showing the characteristics of dolomitization process above 123 c these trends were continued in mg2 concentration dolomite and calcite but ca2 concentration decreased accompanied with the decrease in so4 2 and the increase in anhydrite indicating the precipitation of anhydrite instead of the precipitation of gypsum concentrations of k and na decreased at low temperature steps and did not change significantly at high temperature steps indicating that k ca2 and na ca2 cation exchanges mainly occurred under normal temperatures the increase in sio2 aq with the decrease in quartz and the decrease in hco3 represent the dissolution of quartz and co2 emission respectively which are the common processes in the equilibration of thermal waters giggenbach 1984 inverse modeling was performed on the seawater contaminated hot spring waters to identify hydrogeochemical processes quantitively olea olea et al 2020b plummer et al 1983 the calculated and observed concentrations in the hot spring waters were set as the initial and final solution compositions respectively and the solution volumes were adjusted to be 1 l anhydrite calcite dolomite quartz cax2 kx nax and co2 g were selected as the phases for the modeling the balances of each component and uncertainties were set to 0 01 the modeling results are listed in table 3 in all cases only one model was found for the water rock interactions by the inverse modeling every model commonly shows mole transfers from calcite quartz and cax2 to the solution and from the solution to anhydrite dolomite kx nax and co2 g the molar ratios of decreased calcite to increased dolomite were 1 96 1 91 and 1 99 at the on yo and ry hot springs respectively commonly indicating the dolomitization of calcite the mole transfers from the on and yo hot spring water to kx were 0 33 and 0 03 mmol respectively which were so small that the k ca2 cation exchange could be negligible at the on and yo hot springs the amounts of na ca2 cation exchange 1 6 and 3 43 mmol l respectively were more than those of k ca2 cation exchange but not so big relative to na concentrations in the two hot spring waters table 2 at the ry hot spring 4 7 mmol l of k and 97 4 mmol l of na were exchanged by ca2 indicating that na ca2 cation exchange was one of the dominant water rock interactions as well the amounts of precipitated anhydrite were 3 16 1 59 and 17 1 mmol at the on yo and ry hot springs respectively which were approximately proportional to the seawater fractions in the solutions 5 conclusions ten hot springs in and around the anak sinchon uplift of the korean peninsula were differently influenced by seawater intrusion depending on their location tds value and concentrations of na k ca2 cl and so4 2 in the hot spring waters near the coast showed decreasing trends with the distance from the coastline three hot springs near the coast were considered to be contaminated by seawater seawater fractions were estimated to be 77 8 14 8 and 7 43 at the ry on and yo hot springs respectively the other hot springs were not considered to be contaminated by seawater according to the improved silica geothermometer and tps interpolation the western part of the anak sinchon uplift had high geothermal potential with the temperatures of geothermal reservoir from 103 to 170 c in this study mg2 concentration was used to determine the time order between the heating process and seawater intrusion at seawater contaminated hot spring waters the on and yo hot spring waters were probably mixed with seawater before being heated in the geothermal reservoir and not affected by seawater intrusion again afterwards while the ry hot spring water was probably mixed both before and after being heated in the geothermal reservoir by comparing with the calculated concentrations enrichments in observed ca2 and depletions in observed mg2 and so4 2 were commonly found at three seawater contaminated hot springs depletions in k and na after mixing with seawater were obvious in the ry hot spring water the equilibrium modeling results show that when a seawater freshwater mixture was equilibrated at high temperature in contact with calcite quartz and cax2 water rock interactions such as dolomitization of calcite precipitation of anhydrite dissolution of quartz and k ca2 and na ca2 cation exchanges would occur the inverse modeling results show that dolomitization of calcite and precipitation of anhydrite were the dominant water rock interactions for the seawater contaminated hot spring waters in the study area the results of this study may be helpful to extend

tools being used including processes and frameworks data and models and geospatial or web based tools we also identified several criteria that study participants used to assess whether or not to use a tool within their organization including tool accuracy robustness extendibility interpretability capacity and institutional fit this study suggests that increased communication between tool developers and end users with a focus on tools relevance and ability to support management actions could improve tools and increase the adaptive capacity of users this research also points to the need for multiple lines of future research including how to improve the fit between organizational goals and water tools keywords decision support tools drought management climate change human dimensions of water 1 introduction climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of water shortages and droughts in many parts of the world droughts affect fish and wildlife species abundance and movement forest and rangeland productivity agricultural production and livelihoods and community well being thomas et al 2013 wilhite et al 2007 to answer this challenge governments and practitioner groups have led efforts to increase the adaptive capacity the ability to adapt to the effects of hazards smit and wandel 2006 of organizations that manage water and the land uses water supports adger et al 2003 ficklin et al 2015 decision support tools including those specific to water management have the potential to increase adaptive capacity by providing information needed to plan preventative action and adaption options prokopy et al 2013 unfortunately environmental decision support tool development has largely been disconnected from the behavioral cultural institutional and cognitive context of users wardropper et al 2021 because of this disconnect these tools are often under utilized or unused because they do not match how managers use data and make decisions lemos et al 2012 mcintosh et al 2011 singh et al 2018 walling and vaneeckhaute 2020 we argue that social science research is necessary to understand the motivations barriers and decision processes of decision support tool users to make tools useful and usable prokopy et al 2013 decision support tools for water management water tools henceforth can aid planning to achieve landscape management and conservation goals like drought resilience keyantash and dracup 2004 schwartz et al 2018 vicente serrano et al 2009 drought resilience is the ability to recover from drought through short term coping strategies and long term adaptive capacity scanlon et al 2016 we define water tools as methods and other knowledge resources e g products websites bulletins that integrate information on water climate and weather to facilitate decision making for specific users or objectives noaa 2021a palutikof et al 2019 and particularly focus on water tools for drought management we consider three types of water tools processes and frameworks cohesive sets of activities tools and guidelines used to structure water shortage or drought planning data and models raw or algorithm based climate weather or water information and geospatial or web based tools tools with an online interface component that allows users to interact with the data to meet their own goals palutikof et al 2019 schwartz et al 2018 past social science research has documented the usefulness of water tools in multiple contexts including drought planning by ranchers haigh et al 2021 reservoir management hannaford et al 2019 and power generation planning lopez and haines 2017 for instance hannaford et al 2019 conducted participatory workshops with potential users of drought information in the united kingdom to assess the specific needs of users what triggered their use of drought information and how that information was used within different organizational contexts why and in what ways do users interact with environmental decision support tools past quantitative studies have reported demographic predictors of why different types of individuals use information for decisions including mobile internet consumers venkatesh et al 2012 and agricultural producers rose et al 2016 likewise public administration scholars have investigated policy and organizational factors associated with the use of environmental information to support decisions in organizations wardropper 2018 wardropper and rissman 2019 yet computer scientists and social scientists alike have called for more detailed investigations hewitt and macleod 2017 ritter et al 2014 wardropper et al 2021 from an environmental management standpoint schwartz et al 2018 argue that researchers must better understand how and why decision support tools are used by conservation organizations to inform different stages of adaptive environmental project management including project scoping operational planning and learning this detailed understanding is needed because there are multiple challenges that might impede the use of these tools including lack of organizational capacity to acquire use or implement changes based on new information brody et al 2010 glaas et al 2010 or a lack of fit between the framing or outputs the tool and the needs of a particular organization whittaker et al 2021 at the individual level barriers to using environmental decision support tools might include concerns about information uncertainty coppock 2020 or disconnects between western scientific and local ways of understanding the environment yeh 2016 indeed there have been few qualitative social science studies conducted to understand the contextual and process based reasons why environmental decision support tools are used and for what purposes different criteria have been proposed to improve the use and usability of environmental decision support tools to improve drought indices tools that provide numeric representations of drought severity using several variables e g precipitation temperature soil water engineers keyantash and dracup 2002 proposed several evaluation criteria these include robustness usefulness over a wide range of conditions tractability the practicability of creating an index transparency how much of the rationale and process are shared sophistication high level technical calculation extendibility usefulness across time and dimensionality physical units used to describe the world social scientists have also suggested evaluation criteria for water tools including the accuracy of outputs and the capacity needed for an organization to use the tool hannaford et al 2019 lopez and haines 2017 furthermore research specific to organizational use of decision tools focuses on institutional fit as a criterion for decision tools that is the fit between the problem the tool is meant to address and the institution s goals and structures borowski et al 2008 epstein et al 2015 though these and other evaluation criteria have been proposed for water tools evaluation of environmental decision support tools often gets overlooked wong parodi and small 2021 the us west is experiencing a new climate normal of increased dry weather including more frequent and severe drought noaa 2021b scholars have called for improved tools to aid in day to day as well as high stakes decisions such as drought declarations abatzoglou et al 2017 within this environmental context the long term aims of our applied work are to inform future water tool development for responding to drought and address information use gaps across different organizations the objectives of the present study were to 1 determine which water tools have been used by organizations for large landscape drought management 2 describe tool supported management actions across different organizations and 3 determine usability criteria managers consider when adopting a water tool we used qualitative interview methods for this study which allowed participants to explain their answers in detail while linking institutional and cognitive contexts facilitating a more holistic and deeper understanding of the issues sandelowski 2000 we conducted our study within the high divide region of idaho and montana situated within the larger northern rockies landscape where federal and state government agencies and non governmental organizations ngos have a history of collaboration to increase social ecological resilience to drought in the next section we describe the study area data collection and data analysis procedures in results we present our main findings regarding water tool use and decision criteria following our three research objectives and in the discussion and conclusion section we discuss how our findings might contribute to the improvement of water tools 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the high divide region a 25 million acre region across idaho and montana provides an excellent opportunity to study water tools used for large landscape drought planning and management the broad range of landscape types species and human livelihoods present in the region provide a varied water tool user group which allowed this team to investigate how different behavioral cultural institutional and cognitive factors affect water tool use and usability the region sits within the greater yellowstone ecosystem gye the central idaho wilderness ciw and the crown of the continent ecosystem coc fig 1 and supports diverse vegetation communities including sagebrush steppe forest and rangeland systems while also containing the headwaters of the missouri and columbia rivers the region provides spawning habitat for anadromous fish from the pacific ocean and is important for wildlife connectivity between protected areas such as the gye ciw and coc for large carnivores ungulates and fish carroll et al 2012 mcclure et al 2017 2008 shafer 2015 private ranchlands which make up a higher proportion of all land area when compared to neighboring regions are vital to connectivity between public lands and are becoming increasingly important within the context of increasing climatic and anthropogenic pressures on ecological systems belote et al 2016 graves et al 2019 mcclure et al 2017 in the us northern rockies of idaho and montana drought is a natural part of climate conditions particularly in rangeland dominated ecosystems brown et al 2016 whitlock et al 2017 yet climate projections to the end of the century suggest decreased precipitation in certain times of the year whitlock et al 2017 decreased snowpack resulting from long term warming trends abatzoglou et al 2017 increasing surface temperatures changes in runoff timing and loss of soil moisture holding capacity due to historic unsustainable use of rangelands thurow and taylor 1999 all of which will exacerbate drought when and where it occurs whitlock et al 2017 indeed according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa decadal update the new normal in the us west for the period 1991 to 2020 is drier compared to the previous thirty year period from 1981 to 2010 noaa 2021b increasing drought resilience has been identified as a goal of multiple governmental and non governmental management organizations in the northern rockies region crausbay et al 2017 high divide collaborative 2020a for this research we partnered with the high divide collaborative hdc which defines itself as an effective partnership of public land managers state wildlife agencies landowners local community leaders scientists and conservation groups working together to conserve and restore lands of importance for local communities and to protect ecological integrity at the landscape scale high divide collaborative 2020b drought resilience described as clean and abundant water for headwaters fisheries wildlife healthy riparian communities and human uses is one of eight priority themes that direct the work of hdc high divide collaborative 2020b 2 2 data collection data collection consisted of 31 semi structured interviews i e interviews were guided by a script but included open ended questions to allow for emergent responses with federal state and ngo employees working in the high divide region interviewees were selected based on their attendance at high divide collaborative annual stakeholder meetings held in dillon montana in 2018 and idaho falls idaho in 2019 the hdc annual meeting brings together regional stakeholders to discuss current trends challenges and opportunities regarding issues such as drought resilience sustaining agricultural livelihoods and wildlife connectivity we sent requests for interviews to non profit and federal and state agency meeting attendees via email with one additional email sent one to two weeks after initial contact if no response was received if multiple employees from a single organization attended the hdc meeting we invited individuals with a leadership role or with water and or drought management responsibilities for an interview additional interviewees who worked in the region but were unable to attend the hdc meeting were subsequently added via snowball sampling interviewees belonged to a range of federal state and non governmental organizations including land trusts watershed committees and water user associations as outlined in table 1 for more detail see supplemental material table 4 each interview lasted approximately one hour and was recorded with the participant s permission per our institutional review board protocol the university of idaho irb protocol 18 009 most interviews were held in person at the interviewees place of work though several were conducted via video conference if an in person meeting was not possible we acknowledge that this difference in medium in person versus video conference could have resulted in different levels of participant comfort with the interviewer and therefore the quality of the responses given some interviewees supplied supplementary documents during interviews such as copies of management plans which were used as complementary contextual information during analysis table 2 summarizes interview guide questions by objective the interview guide was developed based on our research objectives and a preliminary literature review of water tools used for drought management in the region we primarily focused questions on drought indices which are a type of water tool important in this region for responding to water availability concerns but interviews often included a wide array of other water tools that our participants used the guide included both open ended questions to provide opportunities for inductive analysis and closed ended questions based on literature e g proposed evaluation criteria for water tools that would allow for deductive analysis objectives 1 and 2 have the same associated interview questions since we found responses to the specified questions could be used to inform either objective the interview guide question related to usability criteria objective 3 was adapted from keyantash and dracup 2002 2 3 data analysis interview transcripts were analyzed with the software nvivo we used an iterative coding approach that included a first round to identify overarching themes for each of our research objectives and then secondary coding to organize and find emergent themes tracy 2012 our approach included both deductive and inductive coding meaning we had initial expectations about the types of responses we might find but allowed for new information to emerge from the transcripts we identified and assigned codes by organization to all water tools to satisfy objective 1 we excluded any tools that were used to monitor water quality which was outside the scope of our study to determine how water tools were applied in management settings objective 2 we created a typology of tool usage across different organization types and associated management actions lastly we coded the transcripts for managers tool usability criteria objective 3 the initial criteria were provided in our interview adapted from keyantash and dracup s 2002 evaluation criteria but we also asked for additional criteria our participants used which resulted in two additional criteria that were of clear importance to managers institutional fit and capacity 3 results 3 1 use of water tools in management organizations we identified approximately 65 water tools used by landscape management organizations in the high divide region these tools fell into three broad categories including processes and frameworks supplemental material table 1 data and models supplemental material table 2 and geospatial and web based tools supplemental material table 3 the most frequently mentioned tools are summarized in table 3 data and models were the most frequently mentioned type of tool for example snowpack data presented by snow telemetry snotel which automates data collection from high mountain watersheds used to monitor snowpack and other climate conditions is used by the us fish and wildlife service to guide water releases from dams for bird habitat table 3 supplemental material table 2 tool supported management was specific to organizations and their respective management priorities supplemental material table 1 2 3 table 3 tool supported management ranged from aiding in understanding conservation action effectiveness to determining individual species management tools were often leveraged for other purposes aside from drought management for example tools were used to inform fisheries management aid in species and habitat modeling and inform conservation easement acquisitions and projects drought preparedness was recognized as important in most organizations and was included at least indirectly in planning processes 3 2 usability criteria for climate tool use interviewees discussed the levels of importance they ascribed to the water tool usability criteria we inquired about explicitly and added other criteria of their own table 4 below we draw on our interview data to describe the perceived role and importance of each criterion for study participants interviewees reflections on usability criteria segued into discussion of the challenges associated with certain water tools 3 2 1 tool accuracy the accuracy of a water tool was defined as the degree of agreement between tool output and measured conditions at the relevant geographic scale federal agency representatives rated this criterion important but understood the difficulties of achieving precise and accurate predictions using one component of many water tools used in the region climate models as described in the following quote well accuracy is important but i mean i ve been involved in science my entire life a model s only as good as the data that we put into it i realize that we re limited and we have a changing climate and this spring for example was supposed to not have been this wet and then we ended up getting a lot more moisture early in the summer we re not going to say you got it wrong we re not going to degrade someone for that they re just going off the best data that they have and then we re doing the same thing adaptive management is something that we always must keep in mind federal agency 4 this federal agency employee worked primarily with vegetation restoration projects and relied heavily on forecasts to plan management and planting sessions yet understood the difficulties of a consistently accurate model state agency employees rated the importance of accuracy over other criteria such as interpretability and extendibility for instance if you use streamstats to make management decisions you re not necessarily using accurate measurements and you can make bad calls because of that so i guess accuracy over readability state agency 3 streamstats is a tool described as relatively user friendly and therefore an appealing tool for managers with less technical tool training ngo representatives added that interpretability was important but not as important as accuracy especially if the manager had access to someone skilled in tool operation 3 2 2 tool robustness at specific spatial scales the robustness of water tools was often talked about in combination with the accuracy criterion many interviewees wanted tools at fine resolutions but some acknowledged that this criterion could be difficult to achieve with a high level of accuracy one federal agency representative thought that potential tool users should be more persistent in their pursuit of using and interpreting lower resolution tools a lot of people tend to fall on that crutch saying well it s not fine enough resolution for me to find useful i think with a little bit of training and sort of a little bit of creative thought about how you use data that appears to be too coarse you can certainly use it federal agency 5 this interviewee was more optimistic about the use of coarser scaled data than many others while acknowledging that additional training may be necessary to make tools more widely usable other interviewees particularly state and ngo representatives expressed a desire for finer scale water tools while also citing a desire to understand the bigger picture state agency 1 in the following quote an ngo representative described the connection between accuracy and spatial scale i think accuracy is important for analytical statistical modeling or projection style modeling and there is a floor below which if it s not accurate enough then no one s going to feel comfortable communicating and using your outputs in a scientific sense i think often accuracy does need to be smaller in spatial scale or higher accuracy comes at a smaller resolution ngo 4 others echoed this preference for finer resolution tools that align with the scale of management objectives particularly smaller ngos that focus on managing individual parcels of land 3 2 3 interpretability of tool outputs interviewees put a high value on the interpretability of water tools many federal agency representatives viewed difficult interpretation as a necessary challenge to work through for the sake of accuracy as reported in the previous section still federal agency representatives acknowledged that being able to understand a tool is crucial to its use we know for certain that a tremendous body of information is not being used to the extent that it could be it s really good to be able to develop these kinds of things especially web based mapping tools but if you don t provide the opportunity for someone to understand how they can use it and even sort of an example of where it s useful so the lightbulb goes on in their head people could tell you something until you re blue in the face but until you learn it for yourself you re not necessarily bought in federal agency 5 this interviewee s job was directly related to translating science to decision makers so they were very familiar with the usability criteria that encouraged tool use many state and ngo representatives expressed the need for an accessible expert to explain water tools and how to use them in unique management contexts one state employee thought it was important for someone familiar with a range of water tools to help colleagues determine the questions they want to answer before trying to interpret a tool s outputs you talk to the manager about what their question is you go back you look at the science you evaluate the science with the manager in the room saying okay so here s all the different climate tools we have what s your real question how can we address and it might be that none of these tools none of your drought tools really answer the question that they have but we might be able to tweak them so that we can answer that question state agency 1 this interviewee held a unique role in their organization as in their words the agency s climate change person they argued for the value of such a position in a state agency but acknowledged that it is rare stating that some other people in the surrounding states have filled that tool expert role in state agencies but i m not sure if it s to the same degree that i do it state agency 1 ngo interviewees also described a need for access to experts land trust 3 regarding water tool use and application in unique management contexts we note that the suggestion to improve interpretability through access to an expert overlaps with the capacity criterion described below 3 2 4 institutional fit for a tool most interviewees described the importance of organizational goals and institutional contexts in deciding whether to use water tools interviewees talked about the difficulty of getting approval to use certain tools within their organizational hierarchy particularly in federal and state agencies and the lack of higher level direction on tool use this federal agency representative described the challenges associated with adopting new policy in government systems i would say the biggest barrier to using climate tools would be vetting it through our national team we have national discipline specialists who oversee evaluating tools to address resource concerns so you would need to have some sort of linkage to a resource concern and approval from whoever that discipline lead was to adopt that tool and then there would be the other requirements for the way that the information is displayed to the public federal agency 2 because federal agencies may have lengthy processes for officially adopting new water tools a particular tool might never be used even if it were locally useful state agency interviewees also spoke to the importance of institutional fit in the following quote about short term management priorities as an agency we re more driven by short term goals a lot of resources or department resources are focused on creating those short term opportunities in the next few years what are the opportunities that we re going to have available for our paying customers state agency 2 because short term goals were a priority in this particular state agency some water tools were less likely to be used because of their focus on longer term change while smaller ngo organizational structures tend to be more flat some ngo representatives discussed the importance of your board making drought planning a priority land trust 3 to enable tool use at a land manager level this ngo employee gave an example of an organization wide climate resilience plan that could not be implemented until the board declared this is the priority and gave permission to set everything else aside land trust 3 3 2 5 capacity to use a tool the need for experts to help interpret water tool outputs was sometimes associated with an underlying lack of organizational capacity to effectively understand and use certain tools capacity was defined in several ways by interviewees including time money and expertise federal agency representatives described lack of capacity as resulting in the need for quick and easy to use tools that can help with day to day decision making for instance one federal agency representative said we don t have time to sit down and think long term even if we want to federal agency 6 state agency representatives added that lack of capacity was one of the major barriers to adopting tools that are not focused directly on short time frames ngo interviewees talked most about lack of capacity as a barrier to using water tools these interviewees touched on all aspects of capacity including time money and expertise as illustrated by the following quote we re aware that there are tools out there and that we can use them but to devote a staff member to potentially putting a year s salary into a conservation plan it s just cost prohibitive land trust 1 particularly in smaller ngos as this small land trust representative described lack of capacity meant that it was even difficult to meet annual programmatic objectives much less learn new tools 4 discussion decision support tools can aid in landscape level planning and fulfilling conservation goals in many systems bagstad et al 2013 keyantash and dracup 2004 wardropper et al 2021 while research has found multiple barriers to decision support tool use for water and drought management brown et al 2016 núñez et al 2014 redmond 2002 we identified many that are currently used in the us northern rockies region while drought planning and climate resilience were rarely mentioned as organizational priorities by our participants these goals often complemented short term management actions organizations across all three types ngos and state and federal agencies relied most heavily on data and models to support decision making there were differences however across organization types associated with the second and third most used tool types the most notable being very minimal adoption of geospatial and web based tools in federal agencies compared to a high level of adoption in ngos who utilized geospatial and web based tools second only to data and models our interviews suggest the lack of geospatial and web based tool utilization in federal agencies is due to many compounding factors which we have previously described in detail as usability criteria or barriers to adoption with bureaucratic policy and procedures institutional fit being one of the biggest challenges interestingly state agencies were more active in adopting geospatial and web based tools when compared to federal agencies which may suggest more flexibility in state policy and procedures regarding adoption of more advanced decision making tools two crucial challenges to tool use were lack of capacity for long term management using tools and lack of fit between a particular tool and institutional objectives institutional fit is an important but understudied factor in natural resources organizations management processes guerrero et al 2021 in the case of water tools interviewees pointed to situations in which higher level decision makers in their organizations did not support the use of particular tools because of conflicting programmatic objectives or contractual issues other issues relating to the interpretability robustness and accuracy of a tool also posed usability challenges for example within discussions of tool interpretation interviewees voiced the need for an expert role to help inform the use and application of tools bridging the gap between researchers and managers as discussed in sunderland et al 2009 furthermore interviewees described the overwhelming abundance of tools which created a cognitive burden when deciding which tool to use for a particular decision there is a need for increased collaboration between tool producers and managers to better inform tool development and use increasing adaptive capacity and achieving sustainable outcomes prokopy et al 2013 schwartz et al 2018 sunderland et al 2009 co production has been proposed as an effective way to increase adaptive capacity goals for organizations or systems bremer and meisch 2017 co production a process through which individuals from different organizations backgrounds or epistemologies work together to develop processes and outputs ostrom 1996 may provide opportunities for tool users and developers to work together to improve tool usability and incorporate into sustainability decisions co production can provide opportunities for tool users and developers to discuss the costs and benefits of for instance using different variables in tool outputs and tradeoffs between accuracy and scale and explore observations from both western scientific and local knowledge mbah et al 2021 vincent et al 2018 importantly co producers of a decision support tool may need to allocate additional time to make the process inclusive collaborative and flexible vincent et al 2020 a boundary organization whose role is to mediate between scientists and users of scientific outputs guston 2001 could help coordinate collaborations to address some of the usability concerns expressed in our interviews our results are intended to improve understanding of how staff in landscape management organizations use water tools and what criteria staff use in determining whether to use a tool one shortcoming of the data collection in this study is that we had unequal representation across different organization types a disproportionate number of our interviewees were from ngos this overrepresentation of ngos may be one reason why capacity came up so often as a barrier to tool use as these organizations often work on shoestring budgets that said as governmental budgets have shrunk over the past several decades in the u s low capacity is a problem faced by governmental and non governmental organizations alike we also only spoke with staff in organizations for this study we did not include individual land managers or owners because this potential user group has very different needs with respect to water tools wardropper et al 2021 while there have been a few recent studies on rancher and pastoralists use of decision support tools coppock 2020 machado et al 2020 more detail is needed to improve tools for this group 5 conclusion as climate change threatens the provision of hydrologic ecosystem services worldwide managers are forced to make decisions under increasing complexity the us west is already experiencing a new climate normal of increased dry weather including more frequent and severe drought noaa 2021b improved decision tools can aid in day to day and longer term decisions such as drought declarations this study provided qualitative data on the process of decision support tool use with the applied aim of addressing a disconnect between managers and researchers in natural science fields in our study region and beyond through interviews and qualitative analysis we identified a wide variety of water tools currently used by staff of governmental and non governmental landscape conservation organizations and provided six criteria our research participants use when deciding whether a tool is appropriate for certain decisions these criteria can be used by both tool creators to assess potential needs and capacity of target users and user organizations to understand which tools are best for the organization s goals and what employees might need to better utilize those tools future qualitative research could further expand our understanding of how decision support tools fit organizational goals and whether co production might improve this fit 6 data

3554,climate is changing in ways that may significantly affect the provision of hydrologic ecosystem services in arid or semi arid regions to answer this challenge there has been an effort to increase the adaptive capacity of organizations that manage water and the land uses water supports governmental and non governmental organizations ngos managing large landscapes in the united states northern rockies region have access to a variety of water decision support tools such as indicators of precipitation and snowpack which could increase their adaptive capacity to manage hydrologic ecosystem services under changing conditions yet little is known about the use of decision support tools in this region and how tools could be improved with the aim of informing future tool development and addressing information use gaps we conducted semi structured interviews with representatives of federal and state agencies and ngos to 1 identify which tools are being used 2 describe tool supported management actions across different types of organizations and 3 determine usability criteria managers consider when adopting a climate tool through qualitative analysis we found multiple types of tools being used including processes and frameworks data and models and geospatial or web based tools we also identified several criteria that study participants used to assess whether or not to use a tool within their organization including tool accuracy robustness extendibility interpretability capacity and institutional fit this study suggests that increased communication between tool developers and end users with a focus on tools relevance and ability to support management actions could improve tools and increase the adaptive capacity of users this research also points to the need for multiple lines of future research including how to improve the fit between organizational goals and water tools keywords decision support tools drought management climate change human dimensions of

information and geospatial or web based tools tools with an online interface component that allows users to interact with the data to meet their own goals palutikof et al 2019 schwartz et al 2018 past social science research has documented the usefulness of water tools in multiple contexts including drought planning by ranchers haigh et al 2021 reservoir management hannaford et al 2019 and power generation planning lopez and haines 2017 for instance hannaford et al 2019 conducted participatory workshops with potential users of drought information in the united kingdom to assess the specific needs of users what triggered their use of drought information and how that information was used within different organizational contexts why and in what ways do users interact with environmental decision support tools past quantitative studies have reported demographic predictors of why different types of individuals use information for decisions including mobile internet consumers venkatesh et al 2012 and agricultural producers rose et al 2016 likewise public administration scholars have investigated policy and organizational factors associated with the use of environmental information to support decisions in organizations wardropper 2018 wardropper and rissman 2019 yet computer scientists and social scientists alike have called for more detailed investigations hewitt and macleod 2017 ritter et al 2014 wardropper et al 2021 from an environmental management standpoint schwartz et al 2018 argue that researchers must better understand how and why decision support tools are used by conservation organizations to inform different stages of adaptive environmental project management including project scoping operational planning and learning this detailed understanding is needed because there are multiple challenges that might impede the use of these tools including lack of organizational capacity to acquire use or implement changes based on new information brody et al 2010 glaas et al 2010 or a lack of fit between the framing or outputs the tool and the needs of a particular organization whittaker et al 2021 at the individual level barriers to using environmental decision support tools might include concerns about information uncertainty coppock 2020 or disconnects between western scientific and local ways of understanding the environment yeh 2016 indeed there have been few qualitative social science studies conducted to understand the contextual and process based reasons why environmental decision support tools are used and for what purposes different criteria have been proposed to improve the use and usability of environmental decision support tools to improve drought indices tools that provide numeric representations of drought severity using several variables e g precipitation temperature soil water engineers keyantash and dracup 2002 proposed several evaluation criteria these include robustness usefulness over a wide range of conditions tractability the practicability of creating an index transparency how much of the rationale and process are shared sophistication high level technical calculation extendibility usefulness across time and dimensionality physical units used to describe the world social scientists have also suggested evaluation criteria for water tools including the accuracy of outputs and the capacity needed for an organization to use the tool hannaford et al 2019 lopez and haines 2017 furthermore research specific to organizational use of decision tools focuses on institutional fit as a criterion for decision tools that is the fit between the problem the tool is meant to address and the institution s goals and structures borowski et al 2008 epstein et al 2015 though these and other evaluation criteria have been proposed for water tools evaluation of environmental decision support tools often gets overlooked wong parodi and small 2021 the us west is experiencing a new climate normal of increased dry weather including more frequent and severe drought noaa 2021b scholars have called for improved tools to aid in day to day as well as high stakes decisions such as drought declarations abatzoglou et al 2017 within this environmental context the long term aims of our applied work are to inform future water tool development for responding to drought and address information use gaps across different organizations the objectives of the present study were to 1 determine which water tools have been used by organizations for large landscape drought management 2 describe tool supported management actions across different organizations and 3 determine usability criteria managers consider when adopting a water tool we used qualitative interview methods for this study which allowed participants to explain their answers in detail while linking institutional and cognitive contexts facilitating a more holistic and deeper understanding of the issues sandelowski 2000 we conducted our study within the high divide region of idaho and montana situated within the larger northern rockies landscape where federal and state government agencies and non governmental organizations ngos have a history of collaboration to increase social ecological resilience to drought in the next section we describe the study area data collection and data analysis procedures in results we present our main findings regarding water tool use and decision criteria following our three research objectives and in the discussion and conclusion section we discuss how our findings might contribute to the improvement of water tools 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the high divide region a 25 million acre region across idaho and montana provides an excellent opportunity to study water tools used for large landscape drought planning and management the broad range of landscape types species and human livelihoods present in the region provide a varied water tool user group which allowed this team to investigate how different behavioral cultural institutional and cognitive factors affect water tool use and usability the region sits within the greater yellowstone ecosystem gye the central idaho wilderness ciw and the crown of the continent ecosystem coc fig 1 and supports diverse vegetation communities including sagebrush steppe forest and rangeland systems while also containing the headwaters of the missouri and columbia rivers the region provides spawning habitat for anadromous fish from the pacific ocean and is important for wildlife connectivity between protected areas such as the gye ciw and coc for large carnivores ungulates and fish carroll et al 2012 mcclure et al 2017 2008 shafer 2015 private ranchlands which make up a higher proportion of all land area when compared to neighboring regions are vital to connectivity between public lands and are becoming increasingly important within the context of increasing climatic and anthropogenic pressures on ecological systems belote et al 2016 graves et al 2019 mcclure et al 2017 in the us northern rockies of idaho and montana drought is a natural part of climate conditions particularly in rangeland dominated ecosystems brown et al 2016 whitlock et al 2017 yet climate projections to the end of the century suggest decreased precipitation in certain times of the year whitlock et al 2017 decreased snowpack resulting from long term warming trends abatzoglou et al 2017 increasing surface temperatures changes in runoff timing and loss of soil moisture holding capacity due to historic unsustainable use of rangelands thurow and taylor 1999 all of which will exacerbate drought when and where it occurs whitlock et al 2017 indeed according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s noaa decadal update the new normal in the us west for the period 1991 to 2020 is drier compared to the previous thirty year period from 1981 to 2010 noaa 2021b increasing drought resilience has been identified as a goal of multiple governmental and non governmental management organizations in the northern rockies region crausbay et al 2017 high divide collaborative 2020a for this research we partnered with the high divide collaborative hdc which defines itself as an effective partnership of public land managers state wildlife agencies landowners local community leaders scientists and conservation groups working together to conserve and restore lands of importance for local communities and to protect ecological integrity at the landscape scale high divide collaborative 2020b drought resilience described as clean and abundant water for headwaters fisheries wildlife healthy riparian communities and human uses is one of eight priority themes that direct the work of hdc high divide collaborative 2020b 2 2 data collection data collection consisted of 31 semi structured interviews i e interviews were guided by a script but included open ended questions to allow for emergent responses with federal state and ngo employees working in the high divide region interviewees were selected based on their attendance at high divide collaborative annual stakeholder meetings held in dillon montana in 2018 and idaho falls idaho in 2019 the hdc annual meeting brings together regional stakeholders to discuss current trends challenges and opportunities regarding issues such as drought resilience sustaining agricultural livelihoods and wildlife connectivity we sent requests for interviews to non profit and federal and state agency meeting attendees via email with one additional email sent one to two weeks after initial contact if no response was received if multiple employees from a single organization attended the hdc meeting we invited individuals with a leadership role or with water and or drought management responsibilities for an interview additional interviewees who worked in the region but were unable to attend the hdc meeting were subsequently added via snowball sampling interviewees belonged to a range of federal state and non governmental organizations including land trusts watershed committees and water user associations as outlined in table 1 for more detail see supplemental material table 4 each interview lasted approximately one hour and was recorded with the participant s permission per our institutional review board protocol the university of idaho irb protocol 18 009 most interviews were held in person at the interviewees place of work though several were conducted via video conference if an in person meeting was not possible we acknowledge that this difference in medium in person versus video conference could have resulted in different levels of participant comfort with the interviewer and therefore the quality of the responses given some interviewees supplied supplementary documents during interviews such as copies of management plans which were used as complementary contextual information during analysis table 2 summarizes interview guide questions by objective the interview guide was developed based on our research objectives and a preliminary literature review of water tools used for drought management in the region we primarily focused questions on drought indices which are a type of water tool important in this region for responding to water availability concerns but interviews often included a wide array of other water tools that our participants used the guide included both open ended questions to provide opportunities for inductive analysis and closed ended questions based on literature e g proposed evaluation criteria for water tools that would allow for deductive analysis objectives 1 and 2 have the same associated interview questions since we found responses to the specified questions could be used to inform either objective the interview guide question related to usability criteria objective 3 was adapted from keyantash and dracup 2002 2 3 data analysis interview transcripts were analyzed with the software nvivo we used an iterative coding approach that included a first round to identify overarching themes for each of our research objectives and then secondary coding to organize and find emergent themes tracy 2012 our approach included both deductive and inductive coding meaning we had initial expectations about the types of responses we might find but allowed for new information to emerge from the transcripts we identified and assigned codes by organization to all water tools to satisfy objective 1 we excluded any tools that were used to monitor water quality which was outside the scope of our study to determine how water tools were applied in management settings objective 2 we created a typology of tool usage across different organization types and associated management actions lastly we coded the transcripts for managers tool usability criteria objective 3 the initial criteria were provided in our interview adapted from keyantash and dracup s 2002 evaluation criteria but we also asked for additional criteria our participants used which resulted in two additional criteria that were of clear importance to managers institutional fit and capacity 3 results 3 1 use of water tools in management organizations we identified approximately 65 water tools used by landscape management organizations in the high divide region these tools fell into three broad categories including processes and frameworks supplemental material table 1 data and models supplemental material table 2 and geospatial and web based tools supplemental material table 3 the most frequently mentioned tools are summarized in table 3 data and models were the most frequently mentioned type of tool for example snowpack data presented by snow telemetry snotel which automates data collection from high mountain watersheds used to monitor snowpack and other climate conditions is used by the us fish and wildlife service to guide water releases from dams for bird habitat table 3 supplemental material table 2 tool supported management was specific to organizations and their respective management priorities supplemental material table 1 2 3 table 3 tool supported management ranged from aiding in understanding conservation action effectiveness to determining individual species management tools were often leveraged for other purposes aside from drought management for example tools were used to inform fisheries management aid in species and habitat modeling and inform conservation easement acquisitions and projects drought preparedness was recognized as important in most organizations and was included at least indirectly in planning processes 3 2 usability criteria for climate tool use interviewees discussed the levels of importance they ascribed to the water tool usability criteria we inquired about explicitly and added other criteria of their own table 4 below we draw on our interview data to describe the perceived role and importance of each criterion for study participants interviewees reflections on usability criteria segued into discussion of the challenges associated with certain water tools 3 2 1 tool accuracy the accuracy of a water tool was defined as the degree of agreement between tool output and measured conditions at the relevant geographic scale federal agency representatives rated this criterion important but understood the difficulties of achieving precise and accurate predictions using one component of many water tools used in the region climate models as described in the following quote well accuracy is important but i mean i ve been involved in science my entire life a model s only as good as the data that we put into it i realize that we re limited and we have a changing climate and this spring for example was supposed to not have been this wet and then we ended up getting a lot more moisture early in the summer we re not going to say you got it wrong we re not going to degrade someone for that they re just going off the best data that they have and then we re doing the same thing adaptive management is something that we always must keep in mind federal agency 4 this federal agency employee worked primarily with vegetation restoration projects and relied heavily on forecasts to plan management and planting sessions yet understood the difficulties of a consistently accurate model state agency employees rated the importance of accuracy over other criteria such as interpretability and extendibility for instance if you use streamstats to make management decisions you re not necessarily using accurate measurements and you can make bad calls because of that so i guess accuracy over readability state agency 3 streamstats is a tool described as relatively user friendly and therefore an appealing tool for managers with less technical tool training ngo representatives added that interpretability was important but not as important as accuracy especially if the manager had access to someone skilled in tool operation 3 2 2 tool robustness at specific spatial scales the robustness of water tools was often talked about in combination with the accuracy criterion many interviewees wanted tools at fine resolutions but some acknowledged that this criterion could be difficult to achieve with a high level of accuracy one federal agency representative thought that potential tool users should be more persistent in their pursuit of using and interpreting lower resolution tools a lot of people tend to fall on that crutch saying well it s not fine enough resolution for me to find useful i think with a little bit of training and sort of a little bit of creative thought about how you use data that appears to be too coarse you can certainly use it federal agency 5 this interviewee was more optimistic about the use of coarser scaled data than many others while acknowledging that additional training may be necessary to make tools more widely usable other interviewees particularly state and ngo representatives expressed a desire for finer scale water tools while also citing a desire to understand the bigger picture state agency 1 in the following quote an ngo representative described the connection between accuracy and spatial scale i think accuracy is important for analytical statistical modeling or projection style modeling and there is a floor below which if it s not accurate enough then no one s going to feel comfortable communicating and using your outputs in a scientific sense i think often accuracy does need to be smaller in spatial scale or higher accuracy comes at a smaller resolution ngo 4 others echoed this preference for finer resolution tools that align with the scale of management objectives particularly smaller ngos that focus on managing individual parcels of land 3 2 3 interpretability of tool outputs interviewees put a high value on the interpretability of water tools many federal agency representatives viewed difficult interpretation as a necessary challenge to work through for the sake of accuracy as reported in the previous section still federal agency representatives acknowledged that being able to understand a tool is crucial to its use we know for certain that a tremendous body of information is not being used to the extent that it could be it s really good to be able to develop these kinds of things especially web based mapping tools but if you don t provide the opportunity for someone to understand how they can use it and even sort of an example of where it s useful so the lightbulb goes on in their head people could tell you something until you re blue in the face but until you learn it for yourself you re not necessarily bought in federal agency 5 this interviewee s job was directly related to translating science to decision makers so they were very familiar with the usability criteria that encouraged tool use many state and ngo representatives expressed the need for an accessible expert to explain water tools and how to use them in unique management contexts one state employee thought it was important for someone familiar with a range of water tools to help colleagues determine the questions they want to answer before trying to interpret a tool s outputs you talk to the manager about what their question is you go back you look at the science you evaluate the science with the manager in the room saying okay so here s all the different climate tools we have what s your real question how can we address and it might be that none of these tools none of your drought tools really answer the question that they have but we might be able to tweak them so that we can answer that question state agency 1 this interviewee held a unique role in their organization as in their words the agency s climate change person they argued for the value of such a position in a state agency but acknowledged that it is rare stating that some other people in the surrounding states have filled that tool expert role in state agencies but i m not sure if it s to the same degree that i do it state agency 1 ngo interviewees also described a need for access to experts land trust 3 regarding water tool use and application in unique management contexts we note that the suggestion to improve interpretability through access to an expert overlaps with the capacity criterion described below 3 2 4 institutional fit for a tool most interviewees described the importance of organizational goals and institutional contexts in deciding whether to use water tools interviewees talked about the difficulty of getting approval to use certain tools within their organizational hierarchy particularly in federal and state agencies and the lack of higher level direction on tool use this federal agency representative described the challenges associated with adopting new policy in government systems i would say the biggest barrier to using climate tools would be vetting it through our national team we have national discipline specialists who oversee evaluating tools to address resource concerns so you would need to have some sort of linkage to a resource concern and approval from whoever that discipline lead was to adopt that tool and then there would be the other requirements for the way that the information is displayed to the public federal agency 2 because federal agencies may have lengthy processes for officially adopting new water tools a particular tool might never be used even if it were locally useful state agency interviewees also spoke to the importance of institutional fit in the following quote about short term management priorities as an agency we re more driven by short term goals a lot of resources or department resources are focused on creating those short term opportunities in the next few years what are the opportunities that we re going to have available for our paying customers state agency 2 because short term goals were a priority in this particular state agency some water tools were less likely to be used because of their focus on longer term change while smaller ngo organizational structures tend to be more flat some ngo representatives discussed the importance of your board making drought planning a priority land trust 3 to enable tool use at a land manager level this ngo employee gave an example of an organization wide climate resilience plan that could not be implemented until the board declared this is the priority and gave permission to set everything else aside land trust 3 3 2 5 capacity to use a tool the need for experts to help interpret water tool outputs was sometimes associated with an underlying lack of organizational capacity to effectively understand and use certain tools capacity was defined in several ways by interviewees including time money and expertise federal agency representatives described lack of capacity as resulting in the need for quick and easy to use tools that can help with day to day decision making for instance one federal agency representative said we don t have time to sit down and think long term even if we want to federal agency 6 state agency representatives added that lack of capacity was one of the major barriers to adopting tools that are not focused directly on short time frames ngo interviewees talked most about lack of capacity as a barrier to using water tools these interviewees touched on all aspects of capacity including time money and expertise as illustrated by the following quote we re aware that there are tools out there and that we can use them but to devote a staff member to potentially putting a year s salary into a conservation plan it s just cost prohibitive land trust 1 particularly in smaller ngos as this small land trust representative described lack of capacity meant that it was even difficult to meet annual programmatic objectives much less learn new tools 4 discussion decision support tools can aid in landscape level planning and fulfilling conservation goals in many systems bagstad et al 2013 keyantash and dracup 2004 wardropper et al 2021 while research has found multiple barriers to decision support tool use for water and drought management brown et al 2016 núñez et al 2014 redmond 2002 we identified many that are currently used in the us northern rockies region while drought planning and climate resilience were rarely mentioned as organizational priorities by our participants these goals often complemented short term management actions organizations across all three types ngos and state and federal agencies relied most heavily on data and models to support decision making there were differences however across organization types associated with the second and third most used tool types the most notable being very minimal adoption of geospatial and web based tools in federal agencies compared to a high level of adoption in ngos who utilized geospatial and web based tools second only to data and models our interviews suggest the lack of geospatial and web based tool utilization in federal agencies is due to many compounding factors which we have previously described in detail as usability criteria or barriers to adoption with bureaucratic policy and procedures institutional fit being one of the biggest challenges interestingly state agencies were more active in adopting geospatial and web based tools when compared to federal agencies which may suggest more flexibility in state policy and procedures regarding adoption of more advanced decision making tools two crucial challenges to tool use were lack of capacity for long term management using tools and lack of fit between a particular tool and institutional objectives institutional fit is an important but understudied factor in natural resources organizations management processes guerrero et al 2021 in the case of water tools interviewees pointed to situations in which higher level decision makers in their organizations did not support the use of particular tools because of conflicting programmatic objectives or contractual issues other issues relating to the interpretability robustness and accuracy of a tool also posed usability challenges for example within discussions of tool interpretation interviewees voiced the need for an expert role to help inform the use and application of tools bridging the gap between researchers and managers as discussed in sunderland et al 2009 furthermore interviewees described the overwhelming abundance of tools which created a cognitive burden when deciding which tool to use for a particular decision there is a need for increased collaboration between tool producers and managers to better inform tool development and use increasing adaptive capacity and achieving sustainable outcomes prokopy et al 2013 schwartz et al 2018 sunderland et al 2009 co production has been proposed as an effective way to increase adaptive capacity goals for organizations or systems bremer and meisch 2017 co production a process through which individuals from different organizations backgrounds or epistemologies work together to develop processes and outputs ostrom 1996 may provide opportunities for tool users and developers to work together to improve tool usability and incorporate into sustainability decisions co production can provide opportunities for tool users and developers to discuss the costs and benefits of for instance using different variables in tool outputs and tradeoffs between accuracy and scale and explore observations from both western scientific and local knowledge mbah et al 2021 vincent et al 2018 importantly co producers of a decision support tool may need to allocate additional time to make the process inclusive collaborative and flexible vincent et al 2020 a boundary organization whose role is to mediate between scientists and users of scientific outputs guston 2001 could help coordinate collaborations to address some of the usability concerns expressed in our interviews our results are intended to improve understanding of how staff in landscape management organizations use water tools and what criteria staff use in determining whether to use a tool one shortcoming of the data collection in this study is that we had unequal representation across different organization types a disproportionate number of our interviewees were from ngos this overrepresentation of ngos may be one reason why capacity came up so often as a barrier to tool use as these organizations often work on shoestring budgets that said as governmental budgets have shrunk over the past several decades in the u s low capacity is a problem faced by governmental and non governmental organizations alike we also only spoke with staff in organizations for this study we did not include individual land managers or owners because this potential user group has very different needs with respect to water tools wardropper et al 2021 while there have been a few recent studies on rancher and pastoralists use of decision support tools coppock 2020 machado et al 2020 more detail is needed to improve tools for this group 5 conclusion as climate change threatens the provision of hydrologic ecosystem services worldwide managers are forced to make decisions under increasing complexity the us west is already experiencing a new climate normal of increased dry weather including more frequent and severe drought noaa 2021b improved decision tools can aid in day to day and longer term decisions such as drought declarations this study provided qualitative data on the process of decision support tool use with the applied aim of addressing a disconnect between managers and researchers in natural science fields in our study region and beyond through interviews and qualitative analysis we identified a wide variety of water tools currently used by staff of governmental and non governmental landscape conservation organizations and provided six criteria our research participants use when deciding whether a tool is appropriate for certain decisions these criteria can be used by both tool creators to assess potential needs and capacity of target users and user organizations to understand which tools are best for the organization s goals and what employees might need to better utilize those tools future qualitative research could further expand our understanding of how decision support tools fit organizational goals and whether co production might improve this fit 6 data
