and hydrogen bonds results showed that the freundlich isothermal model and pseudo second order model were suitable for the characterization of the adsorption process in this work the changing values of thermodynamic parameters including the gibbs free energy entropy and enthalpy indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic in addition the adsorption process was jointly controlled by physical and chemical mechanism in summary the cnd composite adsorbent has potential for utilization in the removal of organic pollutants in real wastewater keywords adsorption shale gas flowback water carbon nanotube nested diatomite adsorbent models 1 introduction high volume hydraulic fracturing technology has become widely used in shale gas exploration with the development of unconventional natural gas energy 1 2 the treatment of shale gas flowback water is one of the key issues in hydraulic fracturing after fracturing activity a complex mixture of wastewater contains massive salts particles metals and numerous organic compounds 3 4 organic matter in shale gas flowback water originates from a number of sources which may include the formation water the solid phase associated with the shale formation water the oil present in the formation and organic chemicals added during production 5 6 treating fluids effectively is difficult because of the complexity of wastewater this situation constrains the development of the shale gas industry in recent years the proper treatment and disposal of shale gas flowback water have become crucial and widely researched topics in general the processes that can be used to treat shale gas flowback water are divided into basic separation technologies advanced treatment technologies and biological treatment 7 the main advanced technologies include adsorption membrane separation thermal distillation and advanced oxidation 8 adsorption is considered as one of the most efficient and simplest pretreatment methods diatomaceous earth de is a geological deposit that mainly consists of the fossilized skeletons of diatoms and other algae the essence of which is aqueous amorphous silica 9 the surfaces of diatom shells are rich in macropores and contain a small amount of mesopores and micropores that confer diatomites with a unique multilevel pore structure 10 therefore de is widely used in industrial applications such as filter aids 11 adsorbents 12 thermal insulation materials 13 and carriers 14 as an adsorbent it is widely used in aqueous pollutants 15 17 nevertheless diatomites have limited adsorption capacity because of their relatively low specific surface area 18 carbon nanotubes cnts as an important carbon material are getting great interest to water treatment because of their small volume and large accessible specific surface area 19 cnts have been used as relatively new adsorbents in various wastewater treatment processes to adsorb many pollutants in water such as metal ion 20 24 and organic matter 25 29 cnts are often present in an agglomeration state which destroys their excellent properties and seriously affects the application 29 although various carbon nanotubes diatomite composite adsorbents have been prepared in recent years existing studies only considered their applications in the removal of a single type of organic matter 30 31 in this research a carbon nanotube nested diatomite adsorbent was prepared and characterized via scanning electron microscopy sem brunauer emmett teller bet mercury intrusion porosimetry mip and x ray diffraction xrd measurements notably work done on the adsorption of organic contaminants in real shale gas flowback water has been scant the objectives of this study were to investigate the capacity of the cnd composite adsorbent for the remove of organic pollutants in shale gas flowback water moreover the effects of parameters including the initial ph of the shale gas flowback water and the dosage of the adsorbent on adsorption property were investigated furthermore gas chromatography mass spectroscopy gc ms was used to characterize the removed organic compounds the adsorption models of cnd composite adsorbents in shale gas flowback water were studied 2 experimental 2 1 shale gas flowback water the shale gas flowback water used in the experiments originated from hydraulic fracturing activities at the lower silurian longmaxi fm a shale gas exploration target in the southern sichuan basin the important chemical and physical parameters of the water used are summarized in table 1 2 2 materials the two main adsorbents used in this study were diatomite and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts the diatomite used in this study was purchased from jilin jiapeng diatomite r d co ltd industrial grade mwcnts 5 10 nm in inner diameter 5 10 nm in outer diameter were obtained from aladdin sulfuric acid ar reagent grade 95 0 98 0 purity was purchased from chron china 2 3 preparation of the high efficiency cnd composite adsorbent the cnd composite adsorbent was prepared through a facile process first diatomite was purified through pretreatment with concentrated sulfuric acid the mwcnts were functionalized through an oxidation approach assisted by ultrasonication in accordance with the literature 32 the mwcnts were added to deionized water and sonicated for 2 h to obtain the cnt suspension then a certain amount of the pretreated diatomite was added into the suspension ultrasonic mixing was performed for 30 min to ensure that the cnts were embedded in the diatomite in a state of good dispensability the positively charged mwcnts were adsorbed and bound by the negatively charged diatomite via electrostatic attraction the change in the zeta potential of the mwcnts and diatomite with ph value is illustrated in figure s1 the positively charged mwcnts and the negatively charged diatomite combined through electrostatic attraction after slight shaking for 5 h the mixture was freeze dried to obtain the cnd composite adsorbent 2 4 characterization of diatomite and cnd composite adsorbent sem images were obtained by using an electron scanning microscope model number zeisse evo ma15 the n2 isothermal absorption desorption curve was measured by a fully automatic physical adsorption instrument 3h 2000pm2 besed at liquid nitrogen temperature 196 c and all samples were subjected to vacuum degassing at 250 c for 2 h before testing macropore size distribution was c determined by using a mercury porosimeter poremaster 33 american conta the structure of the samples was identified from xrd patterns recorded over the 2θ range of 10 90 through powder diffractometry x pert pro mpd panalytical b v 2 5 adsorption experiments the organic compound contents in the flowback were determined on the basis of total organic carbon toc chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod these parameters are used to characterize sewage in this study toc was used to represent the concentration of the adsorbate in water samples the toc content in water was measured by using a toc instrument shimadzu toc vcph japan all samples tests were repeated three times and experimental errors were recorded 2 5 1 effect of variation in adsorbent dose diatomite mwcnts and cnd composite adsorbents 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 and 1000 mg l were added to a 250 ml conical flask containing 150 ml of shale gas flowback water the experiments were performed in an air bath shaker at 150 rpm and 298 k for 2 h and the initial ph was unchanged 2 5 2 effect of variation in initial solution ph the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 2 9 with dilute hcl and naoh to study the influence of solution ph on the adsorption performance of the cnd composite adsorbent the other conditions were the same as those above 2 5 3 effect of variation in contact time toc values were measured after different oscillation time 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 min to investigate the influence of contact time on adsorption efficiency 2 5 4 gc ms analysis the organic compounds present before and after adsorption were analyzed by using gc ms 7890a gc 5975c ms agilent technologies the gc ms test condition is detailed in the supporting information text s1 2 6 adsorption models 2 6 1 adsorption kinetics in this study the first order mode second order model and intra particle diffusion model were used to study the kinetics of the prepared cnd composite adsorbent the results were obtained by comparing the regression coefficient r 2 with the data fit three common models are used to fit adsorption kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order model can be expressed as 1 ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt mg g are the amount of toc absorbed in equilibrium and at different times and k1 and k2 are the rate constants of the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order models of adsorption respectively the k and qe values can be determined through linear fitting the intraparticle model which is used to further understand the adsorption mechanism and rate controlling steps that affect adsorption kinetics is as follows 3 q t k i d t 0 5 c where c is a constant related to the thickness of the interface layer 2 6 2 adsorption isotherms experimental isothermal adsorption data can be fitted by using different isothermal adsorption equations the common isothermal equations are the langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson equations the langmuir model is applicable to the single layer adsorption of adsorbate on composites 33 the model formula is 4 q e q m k l c e 1 c e k l where qe is the toc adsorption amount per unit mass of adsorbent mg g qm is the maximum adsorption amount per unit mass of adsorbent ce is the adsorption equilibrium concentration and kl is the langmuir isotherm constant a dimensionless separation factor rl can be used to determine the feasibility of the adsorption process by using the langmuir parameter kl 34 the value of rl means that the adsorption is unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 favorable 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 35 5 r l 1 1 k l c 0 the freundlich model is applicable for the multi layer adsorption of adsorbates on composites 33 the model is usually presented as 6 q e k f c e 1 n where kf and n are the freundlich constants the value of n can reflect adsorption characteristics specifically n values of 2 10 indicate good adsorption those of 1 2 indicate moderately difficult adsorption and those 1 indicate difficult adsorption 36 many studies have reported that redlich peterson r p equation can be used to describe adsorption systems 37 the model is commonly written as 7 q e a c e 1 b c e β where a is the r p isotherm constant l mg b is the r p isotherm constant l mg and β is an exponent that lies between 1 and 0 2 6 3 adsorption thermodynamics the gibbs function change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs are the main thermodynamic parameters of adsorption these thermodynamic functions can be used to determine the interaction mode and adsorption type between adsorbents and adsorbents their specific expressions are as follows 38 8 k d v c 0 c e m c e 9 l n k d δ s r δ h r t 10 δ g δ h δ s where c0 is the initial concentration of the solution mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration of the solution mg l v is the volume of the solution ml m is the amount of the cnd composite adsorbents added g t is the temperature of the solution at the time of the reaction k and r is the molar gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characteristics of the high efficiency cnd nested adsorbent the morphology and microstructure of diatomite cnts and the cnd composite adsorbent were studied by using sem the results were provided in fig 1 as shown by the sem images in fig 1a the dominant diatomite s pores were evenly distributed with highly developed macropores 480 nm fig 1b reveals that the original mwcnts had smooth surfaces were mostly tubularly curved had micron sized lengths and were entangled with each other to form into a large number of agglomerates fig 1c presents an sem image of the obtained cnd composite adsorbent the mwcnts were randomly and nonuniformly packed into the pores of the diatomite via vertical embedding moreover the bodies of the tubes were partially exposed to the pores outside the diatomite however some mwcnts remained dispersed on the outer surfaces of the diatomite as shown in fig 2 according to iupac classification the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of diatomite belongs to type ii which belonged to a smaller hysteretic loop which was consistent with the previous report that diatomite was mainly composed of macroporous and few mesoporous 39 this finding was agreement with the sem images fig 1a the cnd composite adsorbent in fig 2 indicated the type iv adsorption desorption isothermal curve with an obvious h3 hysteresis loop which reflected that mesopores formed from the cnts when p p0 0 1 n2 adsorption increased rapidly because of the microporous structure of the nanoparticles fig 3 a shows the micropore and mesopore size distributions that were calculated through the bjh method 40 the main peak of about 30 nm in the curve of the cnd composite adsorbent corresponded to the main population of pores and could be easily ascribed to the pores of the cnts the pore size distribution curve of diatomite had no dramatic peak only had a small peak at 3 529 nm the mesopore and macropore size distributions of the diatomite and the cnd composite adsorbent determined through mercury intrusion measurement are shown in fig 3b the macropore groups concentrated at 480 nm due to the inherent macroporous structure of diatomite and the cnd composite adsorbent also had a macropore population of 490 nm the corresponding ordinate of the cnd composite adsorbent was lower than diatomite which merely indicated that some carbon nanotubes were embedded in the pore of diatomite the 8450 nm population resulted from the accumulated macroporous voids of the diatom shells the cnd composite adsorbent also had mesopores sizes of 10 and 34 nm that might have originated from the cnts or the stacked pores that had formed with diatomite the results of pore size distribution showed that the obtained cnd composite adsorbent possessed hierarchically porous structures these results suggested a favorable possibility for the adsorption of multiple organic matter types because of the multi stage porous structure present in the composite table 2 summarized the surface area and pore size distribution of the diatomite mwcnts and cnd composite adsorbents moreover the sbet of the cnd composite adsorbents 39 55 m2 g was slightly higher than those of diatomite 27 90 m2 g the average pore width of the cnd composite adsorbent 22 8216 nm was higher than that of diatomite and mwcnts because of the mesoporous structure of the cnts these analytical data suggested that the cnts were successfully embedded into diatomite the xrd patterns of diatomite mwcnts and the cnd composite adsorbent are shown in fig 4 the xrd pattern of diatomite showed a main broad diffraction peak centered at 22 03 which was consistent with the reference of the amorphous silica 41 the x ray pattern of the mwcnts showed peaks at 2θ 25 95 and 2θ 42 82 that corresponded to the c 002 peak and graphite respectively 33 the cnd composite adsorbent contained the main diffraction peaks of diatomite and mwcnts and the position of the peaks had barely moved this result indicated that the crystal structure of the cnts that had embedded into the diatomite was unchanged compared with the cnts the composite material had a lower specific surface area but better adsorption effect likely because the agglomeration of the cnts in water as shown in fig 1b affected the adsorption effect of the cnts and the preparation of the composite material caused the dispersion of cnts into the pores of the diatomite moreover the surfaces of the composite material contained oxygen containing functional groups that originated from the surfaces of the two precursor materials the formation of hydrogen bonds between oxygen containing functional groups and pollutant molecules during adsorption is conducive for improving adsorption performance 42 3 2 adsorption of shale gas flowback water 3 2 1 effect of variation in adsorbent dose the influence of adsorbent dose 100 1000 mg l on adsorption of shale gas flowback water was studied the easy agglomeration of cnts in water reduces its adsorption effect 42 the characterization analyses presented in the previous section showed that cnts had been successfully dispersedly embedded in diatomite therefore the adsorption effect of the cnd composite adsorbent was significantly better than the other two adsorbents fig 5 as the amount of the cnd composite adsorbent adsorbent was increased from 100 to 400 g l the toc removal rate increased rapidly from 18 to 60 because high adsorbent doses provided additional adsorption sites this effect increased the amounts of organic matter in the shale gas flowback water that could enter adsorption sites when the dosage was 600 mg l the toc removal rate reached 70 further increasing the adsorbent dosage slightly increased the equilibrium removal rate for toc the optimum adsorbent dosage was set as 600 mg l in consideration of efficiency and economy this dose was used in all subsequent adsorption experiments 3 2 2 effect of variation in initial solution ph initial solution ph is an important index of adsorption effect the effect of initial solution ph value on the adsorption performance of shale gas flowback water in the range of 2 9 was studied under the 600 mg l as the cnd composite adsorbent it can be seen from fig 6 that as the ph value of the solution increased from 2 to 6 the toc removal rate increased slowly as the ph further increased to 7 the removal rate decreased sharply when the ph value exceeded 7 and the solution was alkaline the removal rate decreased to 50 under alkaline conditions the hydroxyl ions on the surface of the cnt formed hydrogen bonds with water resulting in a decrement in the surface adsorption sites of the cnd composite adsorbent and thereby reducing equilibrium adsorption capacity 38 moreover the surface silanol group of diatomite was partially dissociated into si o and h in the aqueous solution making the surface negative the zeta potential of the solution itself was also negative and the repulsion of electric charges prevented pollutants from being adsorbed into the pores of the adsorbent when the solution was adjusted to acidity the concentration of h in the solution was high and the presence of h inhibited the ionization of silanol groups which reduced the electronegativity of the diatomite surface which was beneficial to adsorb pollutants in the solution therefore under weak acid conditions the adsorption of shale gas flowback water by cnd composite adsorbent reached the optimal condition ideally the ph values of the original shale gas flowback water were generally 6 7 this situation provided an advantage for the application of the cnd composite adsorbent in the removal of organic from wastewaters therefore ph value affected the electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the adsorbent surface and the pollutant 3 2 3 effect of variation in contact time contact time is also an important factor that affects adsorption as can be seen in fig 7 the removal rate of toc by the cnd composite adsorbent increased rapidly with in the first 10 minut of contact this result showed that organic compounds in shale gas flowback water could treated rapidly and efficiently this trend began to decrease gradually and slowly eventually tended to a line smoothly that is adsorption tended to approach equilibrium the adsorption equilibrium amount was 87 50 mg g and almost reached the maximum value when the adsorption time was 10 min 86 40 mg g likely because the large number of available active sites on the surface of the adsorbent at the beginning of the experiment promoted the adsorption of organic compounds however with the passage of time most of the active sites became occupied by organic compounds until saturation this phenomenon decelerated adsorption beyond the saturation point although the adsorption rate of the composite was relatively fast the maximum amount of adsorption was reached after 10 min the adsorption time of subsequent experiments was set at 30 min to ensure sufficient contact with the adsorbent and maintain a stable adsorption effect 3 2 4 gc ms analysis fig 8 provides the results obtained from the gc ms analysis of the organic species which were extracted from the shale gas flowback water before and after adsorption with diatomite cnts and the cnd composite adsorbent twenty types of typical organic compounds were detected before adsorption and their specific information is shown in table s1 as depicted in fig 8b 16 kinds of organic matter were detected in the solution after adsorption with diatomaceous earth fig 8c shows that 13 kinds of organic substances were detected in the solution after adsorption with cnts as illustrated in fig 8d only seven types of organic compounds were detected after adsorption with the cnd composite adsorbent organic compounds in shale gas flowback water could be divided into seven classes chain alkanes cycloalkanes aromatic hydrocarbons alcohols phenols ketones and esters table 3 the results showed that the cnd composite adsorbents could completely remove alcohols and ketones fig 8b reveals that the adsorption concentration of xylene decreased after adsorption with diatomite the use of shale gas flowback water as the high salt aqueous matrix resulted a substantial decrease in the adsorption capacity of the diatomite to xylene 43 recent research that the demonstrated adsorption of n alkanes by cnts was generally stronger than sorption of their cyclic homologs 46 fig 8c shows that xylene was still detected after adsorption with cnts interestingly xylene was not detected in fig 8d as illustrated in fig 8 acetone cyclohexanol phenol and ethylene glycol were completely removed after diatomite adsorption this study indicated that electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding were the dominant mechanisms of organic matter sorption onto diatomite 45 the organic substances adsorbed by cnts mainly included acetone cyclohexane heptane decane tetradecane hexadecane and heptadecane most organic compounds such as acetone 2 butanone cyclohexane heptane decane 2 4 ditert butylphenol tetradecane hexadecane heptadecane cyclohexanol ethylene glycol and phenol were completely removed it had a good adsorption effect on volatile organic pollutants boiling point of less than 260 degrees celsius adsorption is usually performed as a pretreatment process in water treatment the good adsorption effect of the prepared adsorbent on volatile organic compounds can greatly reduce loads on back end evaporation systems and cause the condensed water to reach discharge standards dibutyl phthalate remained the most abundant compound although its abundance decreased from 62 113 to 21 112 after adsorption therefore the cnd composite adsorbent had the adsorption characteristics of diatomite and cnts 3 3 adsorption models of the cnd composite adsorbent 3 3 1 adsorption kinetics of the cnd composite adsorbent adsorption kinetics can reveal the mass transfer of solutes at the solid liquid interface which is helpful for studying the chemical adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis reaction mechanism 46 the adsorption kinetics of different concentrations of shale gas flowback water on the cnd composite adsorbent are shown in fig 9 the relevant parameters obtained by fitting various kinetic models are shown in table 4 all the correlation coefficient r 2 values of the pseudo second order model were larger than those of pseudo first order model indicating that the pseudo second order model was more suitable than the other models moreover the qe value calculated by using the model indicated high adsorption capacity the theoretical equilibrium adsorption capacity of 95 51 mg g fitted by using the pseudo second order model equation was also very close to the experimental equilibrium adsorption capacity of 87 50 mg g the intra particle diffusion model is a kinetic model that describes the diffusion of an adsorbate inside a particle 47 the adsorption process could be divided into two steps in the first stage the adsorption rate was relatively high and adsorption mainly occurred through membrane diffusion to the external surface of the cnd composite adsorbent in the second step the adsorption rate was slow and the adsorbate diffused in the pores of the adsorbent through in particle diffusion the curve of the first stage did not pass through the origin indicating that adsorption in shale gas flowback water was not controlled by intra particle diffusion alone but also by membrane diffusion and intra particle diffusion overall the adsorption of shale gas flowback water followed the pseudo second order model which included external membrane diffusion surface adsorption and internal particle diffusion etc figs 10 and 11 3 3 2 adsorption isotherms of the cnd composite adsorbent the adsorption isotherm shows how the adsorption molecules distribute between the solid phase and the liquid phase when the adsorption process reaches a state of equilibrium 50 the cnd composite adsorbent was evaluated by using the isotherm models of langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson and the adsorption isotherm equations of different models and their fitting degrees are shown in table 5 the freundlich model provided the highest fitting parameter among the three isotherm models and all were close to 1 rl an important adsorption equilibrium parameter was calculated by using the fitted langmuir isotherm equation the calculated rl value was 0 1939 indicating that the adsorption process was easy moreover the n value of the cnd composite adsorbent was 1 56 indicating that organic compounds were easily adsorbed and that the adsorption process was continuous from the table 5 the r 2 value corresponding to the freundlich model fitting was the largest indicating that this model was the most suitable model for the adsorption process in this study and that the adsorption system exhibited surface energy heterogeneity the adsorption of organic compounds by the cnd composite adsorbent belonged to the multi molecular layers 38 3 3 3 adsorption thermodynamics of the cnd composite adsorbent the positive values of δh implied the endothermic property of the organic compounds in shale gas fracturing flowback water adsorption onto the cnd composite adsorbent the decrease in adsorption enthalpy with the increase in c0 value reflected the surface heterogeneity of the cnd composite adsorbent at the same time the positive value of δs indicated that the turbidity of the adsorbent on the solid liquid surface during the adsorption of organic matter increased the negative values of δg indicated that the adsorption of organic compounds in shale gas flowback water onto the cnd composite adsorbent was a spontaneous process notably the δg values decreased with the increase in temperature showing that the efficiency of the adsorption process increased at high temperatures table 6 δg values between 20 kj mol and 0 kj mol are mainly attributed to physical adsorption those between 20 kj mol and 80 kj mol are ascribed to simultaneous physical and chemical adsorption and those between 80 kj mol and 400 kj mol are mainly chemical adsorption 38 the calculated δg values showed that the interaction between organic compounds and the cnd composite adsorbent likely resulted from the contributions of physical and chemical adsorption processes the dominant force in physical adsorption was intermolecular interactions 50 and in chemical adsorption was electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds 3 4 reusability of cnd composite adsorbent after the completion of each adsorption cycle the adsorbent was soaked in 20 ml of methanol for 1 h centrifuged and then washed with methanol and pure water three times to study the reusability of the cnd composite adsorbent finally the adsorbent was vacuum dried at 60 c and used in the next adsorption cycle the adsorption desorption cycle was carried out five times the removal rate of toc by the adsorbent decreased by less than 10 fig 12 the results of this experiment showed that cnd composite adsorbent was a reusable adsorbent that could be used to remove organic compounds from shale gas flowback water 4 conclusions a high efficiency cnd composite adsorbent composed of acid modified diatomite and mwcnts was successfully manufactured the cnd composite adsorbent had hierarchical mesoporous macroporous structures and demonstrated high adsorption capacity in the removal of n alkanes phenols and alcohols from shale gas flowback water the adsorption rate of organic compounds in shale gas flowback water was fast and the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent could reach to 98 of the equilibrium adsorption capacity within 10 min the results of adsorption studies indicated that the adsorption of toc onto the composites could be mainly attributed to intermolecular interactions electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds between the organic compounds and the adsorbent the freundlich isothermal model and pseudo second order model was applicable for characterizing the adsorption process of organic compounds from cnd composite adsorbents the positive value of δh obtained in the adsorption thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption process in this work was endothermic the δg 0 and δs 0 indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous furthermore the adsorption process was jointly controlled by both physical mechanism and chemical mechanism declaration of competing interest

times and experimental errors were recorded 2 5 1 effect of variation in adsorbent dose diatomite mwcnts and cnd composite adsorbents 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 and 1000 mg l were added to a 250 ml conical flask containing 150 ml of shale gas flowback water the experiments were performed in an air bath shaker at 150 rpm and 298 k for 2 h and the initial ph was unchanged 2 5 2 effect of variation in initial solution ph the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 2 9 with dilute hcl and naoh to study the influence of solution ph on the adsorption performance of the cnd composite adsorbent the other conditions were the same as those above 2 5 3 effect of variation in contact time toc values were measured after different oscillation time 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 min to investigate the influence of contact time on adsorption efficiency 2 5 4 gc ms analysis the organic compounds present before and after adsorption were analyzed by using gc ms 7890a gc 5975c ms agilent technologies the gc ms test condition is detailed in the supporting information text s1 2 6 adsorption models 2 6 1 adsorption kinetics in this study the first order mode second order model and intra particle diffusion model were used to study the kinetics of the prepared cnd composite adsorbent the results were obtained by comparing the regression coefficient r 2 with the data fit three common models are used to fit adsorption kinetics the pseudo first order and pseudo second order model can be expressed as 1 ln q e q t l n q e k 1 t 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt mg g are the amount of toc absorbed in equilibrium and at different times and k1 and k2 are the rate constants of the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order models of adsorption respectively the k and qe values can be determined through linear fitting the intraparticle model which is used to further understand the adsorption mechanism and rate controlling steps that affect adsorption kinetics is as follows 3 q t k i d t 0 5 c where c is a constant related to the thickness of the interface layer 2 6 2 adsorption isotherms experimental isothermal adsorption data can be fitted by using different isothermal adsorption equations the common isothermal equations are the langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson equations the langmuir model is applicable to the single layer adsorption of adsorbate on composites 33 the model formula is 4 q e q m k l c e 1 c e k l where qe is the toc adsorption amount per unit mass of adsorbent mg g qm is the maximum adsorption amount per unit mass of adsorbent ce is the adsorption equilibrium concentration and kl is the langmuir isotherm constant a dimensionless separation factor rl can be used to determine the feasibility of the adsorption process by using the langmuir parameter kl 34 the value of rl means that the adsorption is unfavorable rl 1 linear rl 1 favorable 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 35 5 r l 1 1 k l c 0 the freundlich model is applicable for the multi layer adsorption of adsorbates on composites 33 the model is usually presented as 6 q e k f c e 1 n where kf and n are the freundlich constants the value of n can reflect adsorption characteristics specifically n values of 2 10 indicate good adsorption those of 1 2 indicate moderately difficult adsorption and those 1 indicate difficult adsorption 36 many studies have reported that redlich peterson r p equation can be used to describe adsorption systems 37 the model is commonly written as 7 q e a c e 1 b c e β where a is the r p isotherm constant l mg b is the r p isotherm constant l mg and β is an exponent that lies between 1 and 0 2 6 3 adsorption thermodynamics the gibbs function change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs are the main thermodynamic parameters of adsorption these thermodynamic functions can be used to determine the interaction mode and adsorption type between adsorbents and adsorbents their specific expressions are as follows 38 8 k d v c 0 c e m c e 9 l n k d δ s r δ h r t 10 δ g δ h δ s where c0 is the initial concentration of the solution mg l ce is the equilibrium concentration of the solution mg l v is the volume of the solution ml m is the amount of the cnd composite adsorbents added g t is the temperature of the solution at the time of the reaction k and r is the molar gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characteristics of the high efficiency cnd nested adsorbent the morphology and microstructure of diatomite cnts and the cnd composite adsorbent were studied by using sem the results were provided in fig 1 as shown by the sem images in fig 1a the dominant diatomite s pores were evenly distributed with highly developed macropores 480 nm fig 1b reveals that the original mwcnts had smooth surfaces were mostly tubularly curved had micron sized lengths and were entangled with each other to form into a large number of agglomerates fig 1c presents an sem image of the obtained cnd composite adsorbent the mwcnts were randomly and nonuniformly packed into the pores of the diatomite via vertical embedding moreover the bodies of the tubes were partially exposed to the pores outside the diatomite however some mwcnts remained dispersed on the outer surfaces of the diatomite as shown in fig 2 according to iupac classification the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of diatomite belongs to type ii which belonged to a smaller hysteretic loop which was consistent with the previous report that diatomite was mainly composed of macroporous and few mesoporous 39 this finding was agreement with the sem images fig 1a the cnd composite adsorbent in fig 2 indicated the type iv adsorption desorption isothermal curve with an obvious h3 hysteresis loop which reflected that mesopores formed from the cnts when p p0 0 1 n2 adsorption increased rapidly because of the microporous structure of the nanoparticles fig 3 a shows the micropore and mesopore size distributions that were calculated through the bjh method 40 the main peak of about 30 nm in the curve of the cnd composite adsorbent corresponded to the main population of pores and could be easily ascribed to the pores of the cnts the pore size distribution curve of diatomite had no dramatic peak only had a small peak at 3 529 nm the mesopore and macropore size distributions of the diatomite and the cnd composite adsorbent determined through mercury intrusion measurement are shown in fig 3b the macropore groups concentrated at 480 nm due to the inherent macroporous structure of diatomite and the cnd composite adsorbent also had a macropore population of 490 nm the corresponding ordinate of the cnd composite adsorbent was lower than diatomite which merely indicated that some carbon nanotubes were embedded in the pore of diatomite the 8450 nm population resulted from the accumulated macroporous voids of the diatom shells the cnd composite adsorbent also had mesopores sizes of 10 and 34 nm that might have originated from the cnts or the stacked pores that had formed with diatomite the results of pore size distribution showed that the obtained cnd composite adsorbent possessed hierarchically porous structures these results suggested a favorable possibility for the adsorption of multiple organic matter types because of the multi stage porous structure present in the composite table 2 summarized the surface area and pore size distribution of the diatomite mwcnts and cnd composite adsorbents moreover the sbet of the cnd composite adsorbents 39 55 m2 g was slightly higher than those of diatomite 27 90 m2 g the average pore width of the cnd composite adsorbent 22 8216 nm was higher than that of diatomite and mwcnts because of the mesoporous structure of the cnts these analytical data suggested that the cnts were successfully embedded into diatomite the xrd patterns of diatomite mwcnts and the cnd composite adsorbent are shown in fig 4 the xrd pattern of diatomite showed a main broad diffraction peak centered at 22 03 which was consistent with the reference of the amorphous silica 41 the x ray pattern of the mwcnts showed peaks at 2θ 25 95 and 2θ 42 82 that corresponded to the c 002 peak and graphite respectively 33 the cnd composite adsorbent contained the main diffraction peaks of diatomite and mwcnts and the position of the peaks had barely moved this result indicated that the crystal structure of the cnts that had embedded into the diatomite was unchanged compared with the cnts the composite material had a lower specific surface area but better adsorption effect likely because the agglomeration of the cnts in water as shown in fig 1b affected the adsorption effect of the cnts and the preparation of the composite material caused the dispersion of cnts into the pores of the diatomite moreover the surfaces of the composite material contained oxygen containing functional groups that originated from the surfaces of the two precursor materials the formation of hydrogen bonds between oxygen containing functional groups and pollutant molecules during adsorption is conducive for improving adsorption performance 42 3 2 adsorption of shale gas flowback water 3 2 1 effect of variation in adsorbent dose the influence of adsorbent dose 100 1000 mg l on adsorption of shale gas flowback water was studied the easy agglomeration of cnts in water reduces its adsorption effect 42 the characterization analyses presented in the previous section showed that cnts had been successfully dispersedly embedded in diatomite therefore the adsorption effect of the cnd composite adsorbent was significantly better than the other two adsorbents fig 5 as the amount of the cnd composite adsorbent adsorbent was increased from 100 to 400 g l the toc removal rate increased rapidly from 18 to 60 because high adsorbent doses provided additional adsorption sites this effect increased the amounts of organic matter in the shale gas flowback water that could enter adsorption sites when the dosage was 600 mg l the toc removal rate reached 70 further increasing the adsorbent dosage slightly increased the equilibrium removal rate for toc the optimum adsorbent dosage was set as 600 mg l in consideration of efficiency and economy this dose was used in all subsequent adsorption experiments 3 2 2 effect of variation in initial solution ph initial solution ph is an important index of adsorption effect the effect of initial solution ph value on the adsorption performance of shale gas flowback water in the range of 2 9 was studied under the 600 mg l as the cnd composite adsorbent it can be seen from fig 6 that as the ph value of the solution increased from 2 to 6 the toc removal rate increased slowly as the ph further increased to 7 the removal rate decreased sharply when the ph value exceeded 7 and the solution was alkaline the removal rate decreased to 50 under alkaline conditions the hydroxyl ions on the surface of the cnt formed hydrogen bonds with water resulting in a decrement in the surface adsorption sites of the cnd composite adsorbent and thereby reducing equilibrium adsorption capacity 38 moreover the surface silanol group of diatomite was partially dissociated into si o and h in the aqueous solution making the surface negative the zeta potential of the solution itself was also negative and the repulsion of electric charges prevented pollutants from being adsorbed into the pores of the adsorbent when the solution was adjusted to acidity the concentration of h in the solution was high and the presence of h inhibited the ionization of silanol groups which reduced the electronegativity of the diatomite surface which was beneficial to adsorb pollutants in the solution therefore under weak acid conditions the adsorption of shale gas flowback water by cnd composite adsorbent reached the optimal condition ideally the ph values of the original shale gas flowback water were generally 6 7 this situation provided an advantage for the application of the cnd composite adsorbent in the removal of organic from wastewaters therefore ph value affected the electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the adsorbent surface and the pollutant 3 2 3 effect of variation in contact time contact time is also an important factor that affects adsorption as can be seen in fig 7 the removal rate of toc by the cnd composite adsorbent increased rapidly with in the first 10 minut of contact this result showed that organic compounds in shale gas flowback water could treated rapidly and efficiently this trend began to decrease gradually and slowly eventually tended to a line smoothly that is adsorption tended to approach equilibrium the adsorption equilibrium amount was 87 50 mg g and almost reached the maximum value when the adsorption time was 10 min 86 40 mg g likely because the large number of available active sites on the surface of the adsorbent at the beginning of the experiment promoted the adsorption of organic compounds however with the passage of time most of the active sites became occupied by organic compounds until saturation this phenomenon decelerated adsorption beyond the saturation point although the adsorption rate of the composite was relatively fast the maximum amount of adsorption was reached after 10 min the adsorption time of subsequent experiments was set at 30 min to ensure sufficient contact with the adsorbent and maintain a stable adsorption effect 3 2 4 gc ms analysis fig 8 provides the results obtained from the gc ms analysis of the organic species which were extracted from the shale gas flowback water before and after adsorption with diatomite cnts and the cnd composite adsorbent twenty types of typical organic compounds were detected before adsorption and their specific information is shown in table s1 as depicted in fig 8b 16 kinds of organic matter were detected in the solution after adsorption with diatomaceous earth fig 8c shows that 13 kinds of organic substances were detected in the solution after adsorption with cnts as illustrated in fig 8d only seven types of organic compounds were detected after adsorption with the cnd composite adsorbent organic compounds in shale gas flowback water could be divided into seven classes chain alkanes cycloalkanes aromatic hydrocarbons alcohols phenols ketones and esters table 3 the results showed that the cnd composite adsorbents could completely remove alcohols and ketones fig 8b reveals that the adsorption concentration of xylene decreased after adsorption with diatomite the use of shale gas flowback water as the high salt aqueous matrix resulted a substantial decrease in the adsorption capacity of the diatomite to xylene 43 recent research that the demonstrated adsorption of n alkanes by cnts was generally stronger than sorption of their cyclic homologs 46 fig 8c shows that xylene was still detected after adsorption with cnts interestingly xylene was not detected in fig 8d as illustrated in fig 8 acetone cyclohexanol phenol and ethylene glycol were completely removed after diatomite adsorption this study indicated that electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding were the dominant mechanisms of organic matter sorption onto diatomite 45 the organic substances adsorbed by cnts mainly included acetone cyclohexane heptane decane tetradecane hexadecane and heptadecane most organic compounds such as acetone 2 butanone cyclohexane heptane decane 2 4 ditert butylphenol tetradecane hexadecane heptadecane cyclohexanol ethylene glycol and phenol were completely removed it had a good adsorption effect on volatile organic pollutants boiling point of less than 260 degrees celsius adsorption is usually performed as a pretreatment process in water treatment the good adsorption effect of the prepared adsorbent on volatile organic compounds can greatly reduce loads on back end evaporation systems and cause the condensed water to reach discharge standards dibutyl phthalate remained the most abundant compound although its abundance decreased from 62 113 to 21 112 after adsorption therefore the cnd composite adsorbent had the adsorption characteristics of diatomite and cnts 3 3 adsorption models of the cnd composite adsorbent 3 3 1 adsorption kinetics of the cnd composite adsorbent adsorption kinetics can reveal the mass transfer of solutes at the solid liquid interface which is helpful for studying the chemical adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis reaction mechanism 46 the adsorption kinetics of different concentrations of shale gas flowback water on the cnd composite adsorbent are shown in fig 9 the relevant parameters obtained by fitting various kinetic models are shown in table 4 all the correlation coefficient r 2 values of the pseudo second order model were larger than those of pseudo first order model indicating that the pseudo second order model was more suitable than the other models moreover the qe value calculated by using the model indicated high adsorption capacity the theoretical equilibrium adsorption capacity of 95 51 mg g fitted by using the pseudo second order model equation was also very close to the experimental equilibrium adsorption capacity of 87 50 mg g the intra particle diffusion model is a kinetic model that describes the diffusion of an adsorbate inside a particle 47 the adsorption process could be divided into two steps in the first stage the adsorption rate was relatively high and adsorption mainly occurred through membrane diffusion to the external surface of the cnd composite adsorbent in the second step the adsorption rate was slow and the adsorbate diffused in the pores of the adsorbent through in particle diffusion the curve of the first stage did not pass through the origin indicating that adsorption in shale gas flowback water was not controlled by intra particle diffusion alone but also by membrane diffusion and intra particle diffusion overall the adsorption of shale gas flowback water followed the pseudo second order model which included external membrane diffusion surface adsorption and internal particle diffusion etc figs 10 and 11 3 3 2 adsorption isotherms of the cnd composite adsorbent the adsorption isotherm shows how the adsorption molecules distribute between the solid phase and the liquid phase when the adsorption process reaches a state of equilibrium 50 the cnd composite adsorbent was evaluated by using the isotherm models of langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson and the adsorption isotherm equations of different models and their fitting degrees are shown in table 5 the freundlich model provided the highest fitting parameter among the three isotherm models and all were close to 1 rl an important adsorption equilibrium parameter was calculated by using the fitted langmuir isotherm equation the calculated rl value was 0 1939 indicating that the adsorption process was easy moreover the n value of the cnd composite adsorbent was 1 56 indicating that organic compounds were easily adsorbed and that the adsorption process was continuous from the table 5 the r 2 value corresponding to the freundlich model fitting was the largest indicating that this model was the most suitable model for the adsorption process in this study and that the adsorption system exhibited surface energy heterogeneity the adsorption of organic compounds by the cnd composite adsorbent belonged to the multi molecular layers 38 3 3 3 adsorption thermodynamics of the cnd composite adsorbent the positive values of δh implied the endothermic property of the organic compounds in shale gas fracturing flowback water adsorption onto the cnd composite adsorbent the decrease in adsorption enthalpy with the increase in c0 value reflected the surface heterogeneity of the cnd composite adsorbent at the same time the positive value of δs indicated that the turbidity of the adsorbent on the solid liquid surface during the adsorption of organic matter increased the negative values of δg indicated that the adsorption of organic compounds in shale gas flowback water onto the cnd composite adsorbent was a spontaneous process notably the δg values decreased with the increase in temperature showing that the efficiency of the adsorption process increased at high temperatures table 6 δg values between 20 kj mol and 0 kj mol are mainly attributed to physical adsorption those between 20 kj mol and 80 kj mol are ascribed to simultaneous physical and chemical adsorption and those between 80 kj mol and 400 kj mol are mainly chemical adsorption 38 the calculated δg values showed that the interaction between organic compounds and the cnd composite adsorbent likely resulted from the contributions of physical and chemical adsorption processes the dominant force in physical adsorption was intermolecular interactions 50 and in chemical adsorption was electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds 3 4 reusability of cnd composite adsorbent after the completion of each adsorption cycle the adsorbent was soaked in 20 ml of methanol for 1 h centrifuged and then washed with methanol and pure water three times to study the reusability of the cnd composite adsorbent finally the adsorbent was vacuum dried at 60 c and used in the next adsorption cycle the adsorption desorption cycle was carried out five times the removal rate of toc by the adsorbent decreased by less than 10 fig 12 the results of this experiment showed that cnd composite adsorbent was a reusable adsorbent that could be used to remove organic compounds from shale gas flowback water 4 conclusions a high efficiency cnd composite adsorbent composed of acid modified diatomite and mwcnts was successfully manufactured the cnd composite adsorbent had hierarchical mesoporous macroporous structures and demonstrated high adsorption capacity in the removal of n alkanes phenols and alcohols from shale gas flowback water the adsorption rate of organic compounds in shale gas flowback water was fast and the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent could reach to 98 of the equilibrium adsorption capacity within 10 min the results of adsorption studies indicated that the adsorption of toc onto the composites could be mainly attributed to intermolecular interactions electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonds between the organic compounds and the adsorbent the freundlich isothermal model and pseudo second order model was applicable for characterizing the adsorption process of organic compounds from cnd composite adsorbents the positive value of δh obtained in the adsorption thermodynamic study indicated that the adsorption process in this work was endothermic the δg 0 and δs 0 indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous furthermore the adsorption process was jointly controlled by both physical mechanism and chemical mechanism declaration of competing interest

13436,this work reports on reactivation of aerobic granular sludge ags for the treatment of industrial recalcitrant wastewater slop wastewater characterized by high salinity and hydrocarbons ags were reactivated in two reactors r1 and r2 to treat industrial slop wastewater after a long term storage for 12 months at 4 c in r1 salt adapted mature aerobic granules were previously subjected to a step wise increase of hydrocarbons whereas in r2 aerobic granules were previously cultivated in presence of salinity and hydrocarbons after a short term reactivation period the slop dosage caused a simultaneous decrease of granules dimensions and proteins polysaccharides pn ps ratio down to 1 76 r1 and 2 35 r2 then the increase of granules dimensions and of the pn ps ratio up to 5 63 r1 and 4 22 r2 suggested a new granulation process the difference in total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs removal efficiencies 87 r1 and 97 r2 was mainly due to a biodegradation effect in r2 where granules were previously cultivated with slop this was confirmed by a simultaneous decrease of tphs concentration in the bulk and adsorbed into granules based on next generation sequencing of metagenomic 16s encoding genes in r2 typical oil polluted seawater associated bacteria were detected which probably played key roles in tphs biodegradation keywords aerobic granular sludge reactivation industrial wastewater tph hydrocarbon eps ngs 16s rdna 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology is a promising and effective biofilm system having the capability to treat both domestic and industrial wastewater by means of self aggregated microorganisms 1 3 the main feature of ags technology arises from the biofilm stratification and microbial diversity present in each granule the coexistence of i heterotrophic microorganisms for organic matter removal and heterothrophic denitrification ii autotrophic microorganisms such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob for nitrogen conversions and iii phosphorous accumulating microorganisms pao for phosphorous removal allows the simultaneous removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorous in each aerobic granule 4 5 another relevant aspect of ags technology is represented by the bio adsorption capacity towards metals and recalcitrant particulate matter commonly present in industrial wastewater through extracellular polymeric substances eps 6 9 furthermore bio adsorption increases the contact time between microorganisms and recalcitrant contaminants thus increasing the biodegradation potential 10 for the aforementioned reasons an increasing interest has been expressed for the treatment of industrial wastewater with ags 3 11 the cultivation of granular sludge with industrial wastewater is possible and preferable in comparison with synthetic medium since it leads to the development of aerobic granules made of specialized microorganisms able to biodegrade recalcitrant compounds 10 12 13 however the loss of granules stability is the main drawback that hampers the scale up of the technology 14 especially when treating industrial wastewater a breakage of granules in a full scale ags plant may imply the loss of solid matters in the effluent and a drop in removal efficiencies thus generating a severe environmental impact 2 14 furthermore both cultivation and adaptation of microorganisms to the recalcitrant compounds are gradual processes that could require a step wise increase of influent pollutants concentration even for several months 10 15 bearing in mind the above the possibility to store pre cultivated and stable mature aerobic granules to be reactivated after a long period is focusing the interest of several researches 16 26 past studies revealed that a long term storage of aerobic granular sludge could imply a loss of structural stability and biological activity mainly due to cell and proteins hydrolysis 27 storage at high temperature causes high hydrolysis whereas low temperatures i e 4 c or freezing at 20 c 25 c could hamper cell and protein hydrolysis thus resulting in a maintenance and preservation of granules stability 28 29 regarding the freezing technique of the aerobic granules many authors found that after thawing the frozen ags the maintenance of structural integrity and the prompt recovery of biological activity were observed 17 24 25 in particular a prolonged storage of frozen aerobic granules is possible because most microbial activities stop but storing at low temperatures is an expensive practice because it requires high energy consumption and operating costs thus hampering the application at large scale however the study of storage reactivation techniques of ags and the understanding of the maintenance of structural stability and the recovery of both physical and biological characteristics of granular biomasses are important for full scale applications of ags technology the direct advantage that could be associated to this practice is represented by the shortening of the start up period of full scale ags plants to the best of the authors knowledge researches about storage and reactivation of aerobic granular sludge are dealt with synthethic wastewater and to date there are no works dealing about storage and reactivation of ags for the treatment of real industrial wastewater characterized by high salinity and contaminated by hydrocarbons slop wastewater the main objective and the novelty of this work are represented by the reactivation of aerobic granular sludge for the treatment of industrial recalcitrant slop wastewater characterized by high salinity and hydrocarbons the effects of long term storage for 12 months at 4 c have been analysed on two different aerobic granular biomasses the first one was cultivated with synthetic wastewater the second one was cultivated with slop wastewater both the reactivated aerobic granular sludges were studied in terms of treatment performances of real industrial slop wastewater attention was paid to granules structure and stability eps production pollutants removal efficiencies bacterial community composition in silico predicted cellular and metabolic capabilities 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of aerobic granular sludge the aerobic granular sludges used in this experimental work were cultivated in bench scale sequencing batch airlift reactors sbars hereinafter named r1 and r2 figure s1 having a working volume of 3 5 l and a height diameter h d ratio of 10 as reported in a previous study 10 the two sbars were inoculated in a previous experimental campaign lasted 150 days of operation 10 with different granular biomasses r1 was inoculated with granules cultivated with synthetic medium in a saline environment and subsequently adapted to hydrocarbons contained in slop wastewater r2 was inoculated with granules cultivated with slop thus simultaneously adapted to salinity and hydrocarbons both the reactors were operated in 6 hs cycles comprising 20 min feeding 320 333 min aeration 15 2 min settling and 5 min effluent discharge the volumetric exchange ratio ver was fixed at 50 and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h 2 2 storage conditions after 150 days of operation in a previous experimental campaign 10 the aerobic granules of both the reactors immersed into saline slop wastewater were transferred into two 5 l dark glass bottles the bottles were sealed and stored for 12 months at 4 c in a certified cold room 2 3 reactivation procedure after the long term storage the aerobic granular sludges were reactivated in the sbars described in the 2 1 section the objective was to evaluate the reactivation of microbial metabolisms of ags bacteria after a long term period of storage 12 months at 4 c before starting up the reactors the stored granules were washed for five times with saline water at the same salt concentration of slop to avoid the occurrence of osmotic stress for the microbial cells of ags then the washed granules were seeded into each reactor and they were subjected to an initial reactivation 12 days with synthetic saline wastewater followed by the treatment of real slop wastewater 2 4 wastewater composition and operational conditions shipboard slop wastewater after de oiling pre treatment were characterized by a total chemical oxygen demand codt of 816 94 mg l 1 a soluble chemical oxygen demand cods of 530 32 mg l 1 a total organic carbon toc of 390 3 mg l 1 total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs of 151 3 mg l 1 salinity of 37 8 1 5 g nacl l 1 and a ph of 7 78 0 62 during the first 12 days both the stored aerobic granular sludges were subjected to a reactivation phase where the feeding was a saline synthetic medium characterized by the stoichiometric proportions used by beun et al 2002 30 in addition nacl was manually added to obtain the same salinity of slop wastewater 37 8 gnacl l 1 this preliminary dosage of synthetic medium was performed to enhance the reactivation of biomass after the long term storage of 12 months at 4 c then once granules recovered the removal efficiencies of organic matter only real slop wastewater was fed to the reactors 2 5 analytical procedures all the analytical procedures were performed according to a previous research by campo and di bella 2019 10 a detailed description is provided in the annexed supplementary material 2 6 next generation sequencing ngs of 16s rdna amplicons and analysis metagenomic deoxyribonucleic acid dna used for characterization of the bacterial communities in r1 and r2 was extracted from samples collected at day 0 start of reactivation phase and day 40 fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals irvine ca usa was used for dna extraction following the protocol provided by the manufacturer and using about 100 mg of granules as starting material after harvesting of samples from reactors all subsequent procedures were performed in sterile conditions to avoid contamination with environmental microorganisms all details about polymerase chain reaction pcr ngs procedures bioinformatic and computational analysis of microbiological data are accurately described in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical properties of granules fig 1 shows the trends of tss and vss for r1 fig 1a and r2 fig 1b in r1 the initial granular biomass concentration was 1 4 gvss l 1 and the vss tss ratio was close to 58 at the end of the reactivation phase the vss concentration increased up to 3 gvss l 1 highlighting a net growth of biomass yield likely due to the biological reactivation of microbial metabolism however when slop was fed to the system a decrease of the vss concentration down to 1 72 gvss l 1 was observed suggesting an initial metabolic inhibition due to the substitution of the readily biodegradable substrate sodium acetate with a recalcitrant substrate slop wastewater the decreasing trend proceeded down to 1 19 gvss l 1 with a minimum of 34 of the vss tss ratio denoting an inhibitory effect of the recalcitrant substrate towards the microbial metabolism of ags then a gradual increase of solids concentration and vss tss ratio up to 2 66 gvss l 1 and 66 respectively suggested an adaptation of microorganisms to the hydrocarbons of slop in r2 similar trends of solids concentration were observed basically the initial granular biomass concentration was close to 1 gvss l 1 and the vss tss ratio was 62 granular biomass grew during the reactivation phase up to 2 gvss l 1 day 12 also in this case the slop dosage determined an initial decrease of metabolic capability of ags microorganisms that resulted in a decrease of volatile suspended solids down to 1 15 gvss l 1 day 14 until the day 26 after that a gradual increase of biomass concentration from 1 11 gvss l 1 up to 2 31 gvss l 1 suggested a metabolic adaptation of microorganisms to the recalcitrant substrate of slop regarding the granules dimensions a particle size distribution psd analysis was assessed for both r1 fig 1c and r2 fig 1d a psd analysis for granular sludge systems is indicative of structural stability of granular biomasses through the monitoring of the variations of characteristic diameters of granules 10 in particular after an initial increase of d50 during the reactivation phase from 1 23 to 1 33 mm for r1 and from 0 89 to 1 11 mm for r2 the slop dosage provoked a partial breakage of granules in both the systems and a decrease of d50 down to 0 78 mm and 0 58 mm in r1 and r2 respectively this was a further evidence of an initial inhibition of ags microorganisms but this did not imply a leakage of solids in the effluents that resulted below 0 5 mg l 1 in both the reactors as shown in fig 1 a b therefore although a partial breakage of granules was observed the fragments of broken granules had high settling properties and the majority of them was retained inside the sbars then the d50 increased again up to 0 96 mm and 0 93 mm for r1 and r2 respectively furthermore in r1 and in r2 both d10 and d90 followed the same trend of d50 however in r1 the granulation rate was always 100 and the lowest value of d10 was 0 39 mm day 26 higher than the value of 200 μm conventionally known as the threshold for ags 31 although in r2 the lowest value of d10 was 0 23 mm day 26 higher than the ags threshold value of 200 μm the granulation rate of that operational day was close to 95 small aggregates not properly granules having diameters between the 0 10 mm and 0 20 mm dimensional classes were present in r2 on day 26 with a distribution frequency of 5 21 however their settling velocity was higher than the fixed settling time for the sbar thus resulting in an almost complete retention inside the reactor as discussed previously about tssout then a full granular system was restored in r2 and the granulation rate increased up to 100 until the end of the experimental period in order to support the previous considerations fig 2 shows the images of aerobic granules in r1 and r2 throughout all the experimental period noteworthy after the long term storage for 12 months at 4 c into the slop wastewater granules in r1 fig 2a and in r2 fig 2b appeared with a reddish color and round shaped without any deterioration of the morphology and structure this confirmed the results achieved by other authors about stored aerobic granules in synthetic medium 18 24 25 after the reactivation phase granules appeared with a larger dimension fig 1c d and with smoother edges in r1 fig 2c and in r2 fig 2d subsequently the slop dosage caused a change of granules color from reddish to brownish and provoked a breakage of ags thus reaching its peak the day 26 in both the systems fig 2e for r1 and fig 2f for r2 as discussed previously however in r2 the breakage occurred in a greater extent compared to r1 as visible in fig 2f and as discussed previously by studying the particle size distribution of aerobic granules in fact some granules lost their stability resulting in breakages of their original structures nevertheless as discussed previously the single fragments of broken granules were retained inside the bioreactors and they constituted new nucleation points for a new granulation process 32 that occurred for the remaining days of operation fig 2g h 3 2 soluble microbial products smps and extracellular polymeric substances epss production interesting results were registered in terms of soluble microbial products smps and epss production the analysis of the existing literature revealed that when microorganisms are in presence of environmental stresses or inhibitory agents they produce high amounts of smps and epss that might help bacteria to protect themselves and to cope with the stress 33 34 regarding the smps fig 3 a b it possible to see that in both the reactors no significant production of smps was registered during the reactivation phase when the systems were fed with synthetic saline wastewater with sodium acetate as sole carbon source therefore the salt adapted granules did not undergo any environmental stress and the production of soluble microbial products was quite low as also observed by dong et al 2017 35 then when slop was fed to the reactors in r1 a gradual increase of proteins smps was registered up to 91 mg gvss 1 day 26 the dense and compact granules of r1 produced more smps as response to the metabolic stress caused by the recalcitrant substrate after that a slight decrease of protein smps down to 72 mg gvss 1 suggested an adaptation of biomass to the environmental conditions by observing the r2 data after the slop dosage a sudden peak of protein smp up to 120 mg gvss 1 was registered in this case the less dense granules immediately responded to recalcitrant compounds hydrocarbons by producing a higher amount of protein smp compared to r1 then also in this case the gradual decrease of smps down to 89 mg gvss 1 day 34 was likely due to the adaptation of microorganisms to the industrial recalcitrant slop feeding regarding to the bound eps fig 3c d it should be highlighted that the day of reactivation day 0 after the long term storage for 12 months at 4 c into the slop wastewater values of 51 mg gvss 1 and 47 mg gvss 1 of protein epss and values of 22 mg gvss 1 and 17 mg gvss 1 of polysaccharides epss were registered for r1 and r2 respectively these specific concentrations are surprising if one considers that granules were simply stored at 4 c immersed into the industrial slop wastewater and without oxygen supply an explaination of this phenomenon is attributable to the eps content of ags epss have a crucial role in constituting a gelatinous matrix that promote the aggregation of microorganisms thus promoting ags formation and ensuring granules structural stability and integrity 36 37 therefore epss represent a protective barrier for the cells 38 39 and may have preserved both proteins and polysaccharides content during the long term storage of ags at 4 c in literature mcswain et al 2005 36 found that the stability of granules was dependent on a proteins core whereas seviour et al 2012 40 discovered that polysaccharides was in favour of the gel forming and formation of granular sludge therefore by applying the aforementioned storage conditions granules were able to maintain their structure as shown in fig 2a b this was mainly due to the preservation of the proteins and the polysaccharides in the granule bound epss matrix that conferred a structuring and a cohesive function to microbial cells of granules the pn ps ratio of granular sludge epss has been monitored as a further indicative parameter of structural stability of ags 41 in fact a higher pn ps ratio of eps contributes to increase the hydrophobicity of the aggregates thus promoting the microbial aggregation and enhancing granular sludge stability 42 43 the pn ps ratios observed in both the reactors during the start up day 0 were close to 2 29 and 2 76 for r1 and r2 respectively thus denoting the dominance of the structuring protein fraction of epss 44 subsequently granules enforced their stability and this is confirmed by the increase of the pn ps ratios up to 3 88 and 5 15 for r1 and r2 respectively at the same time as granules became structurally more stable they produced less bound epss at the end of the reactivation phase after the dosage of the slop wastewater a collapse of the pn ps ratios down to 1 76 for r1 and 2 35 for r2 mainly due to a decrease of protein content determined a weakening of granules structure thus leading to the breakage as discussed previously then different behaviors were observed in the reactors in r1 granules reacted by increasing the bound proteins production from 18 to 56 mg gvss 1 day 26 and consequently the pn ps ratio increased up to 4 52 this implied a rapid re granulation process thus suggesting the overcoming of the inhibitory effect of the recalcitrant compounds of the slop wastewater on microbial metabolism finally once new granules were formed day 34 a less production of granule bound epss was observed and the pn ps ratio further increased up to 5 63 due to a maturation of the new formed granules on the other hand in r2 the granule bound epss content remained almost constant until the day 26 and the re granulation process was slower if compared to r1 also in this case a reduction of granule bound epss production was observed at the end of operation and an increase of pn ps ratio up to 4 22 denoted a strengthening of granules structure as also observed by zhu et al 2015 44 3 3 organic matter removal in fig 4 the organic matter removal efficiencies in terms of codt cods and toc are shown looking at the codt fig 4a b in r1 after the reactivation period where a removal efficiency of 53 was obtained the slop dosage implied a gradual increase of the effluent codt concentration and led to a low removal efficiency close to 20 at the end of operation this suggested that initially microorganisms were not able to biodegrade the recalcitrant fraction of slop likely due to presence of hydrocarbons that exerted an inhibitory effect also in r2 a slight increase of the effluent codt concentration was observed when slop was dosed to the reactor however the codt effluent concentration remained almost constant until the end of operation achieving a removal efficiency close to 40 regarding the cods fig 4c d in r1 a similar trend to codt was observed thus confirming the inhibition of metabolism of microorganisms likely due to the presence of hydrocarbons and a cods removal efficiency close to 28 was registered however in r2 after the initial increase of the effluent cods concentration due to the slop dosage a gradual decrease of effluent concentration was registered until the end of operation thus achieving a removal efficiency close to 59 this trend suggested a gradual metabolic adaptation and acclimatization of ags microorganisms to the recalcitrant substrate another important information is given by the toc analysis fig 4e f that has shown more regular trends in r1 after the slop dosage a decrease of the toc removal efficiency from 90 to 57 was registered day 22 then a progressive recovery of the removal efficiencies until the end of the study was observed this suggested an initial inhibition and a subsequent progressive adaptation of ags microorganisms to the environmental conditions in r2 a completely different response was registered in terms of toc removal the slop dosage did not affect the toc removal efficiency that was maintained close to 90 throughout the whole experimental period this suggested that in r2 biomass did not undergo a metabolic inhibition when slop was fed to the reactors moreover granules in r1 removed the recalcitrant organic matter mainly through a physical bio adsorption while in r2 the cultivation of granules with slop wastewater 10 also implied a biological selection of bacteria composing the ags biofilm thus enhancing the growth of specialized microorganisms able to degrade the recalcitrant substrate however after the long term storage and the subsequent reactivation in both the reactors granules recovered their original functionalities 3 4 tph removal the main objective of this work was to evaluate the ags reactivation after storage for 12 months at 4 c for the treatment of slop wastewater regarding the tph removal fig 5 shows a comparative analysis of tph removal in liquid phase fig 5a and adsorbed in solid phase fig 5b for r1 and r2 respectively in particular both the reactors removed tph thus confirming the effectiveness of ags technology for the treatment of recalcitrant substrates however by comparing the obtained results in liquid phase of both the reactors fig 5a it is possible to see that in r1 an initial decrease of tph removal efficiency from 80 down to 66 day 26 confirmed an initial metabolic inhibition of ags microorganisms when slop was fed to the reactor then the system gradually increased its removal efficiency up to 87 at the end of experimentation however the discharge limit imposed by the marpol 73 78 45 for tph 5 mg l 1 was not fulfilled and an effluent concentration of 19 5 mgtph l 1 was obtained at the end of the study on the other hand r2 provided better tph removal efficiencies than r1 showing a continuously increasing trend of tph removal efficiency from 80 to more than 95 moreover starting from the day 35 the tph effluent concentration was lower than the discharge limit of 5 mgtph l 1 although the regranulation process resulted slower in r2 the tph removal efficiency was higher than in r1 and complied with the law limits therefore the ags cultivated directly with slop wastewater r2 demonstrated better performances treating the recalcitrant industrial slop wastewater also after a long term storage of granules bearing in mind the above the cultivation of ags with the industrial wastewater to treat as occurred for r2 is highly recommended moreover the cultivation of ags with synthetic wastewater as occurred for r1 is not applicable in full scale mainly due to the high operational costs of reagents further interesting results were obtained by analyzing the adsorbed fraction of tph into the granules surface fig 5b it is quite evident that in r1 the main tph removal mechanism was the bio adsorption while in r2 the simultaneous decrease of the tph concentrations in liquid phase and adsorbed in solid phase suggested that the main tph removal pathway was the biodegradation of the bio adsorbed fraction of hydrocarbons the previous results were confirmed by the analysis of hydrocarbons speciation both in liquid and in solid granules phases performed at the end of the study day 40 for r1 fig 5c and r2 fig 5d respectively in r1 the higher effluent hydrocarbons concentrations were likely due to the progressive saturation of the bio adsorbent sites of granules and to a probable de sorption phenomenon given the high hydrocarbons concentration gradient between the granules surface and the bulk liquid on the other hand in r2 both the trends of the adsorbed and the effluent tph concentrations suggested a continuous bio adsorption hydrolysis and biodegradation of the adsorbed fractions thus implying a continuous regeneration of the bio adsorbent sites that were available for new hydrocarbons adsorption bearing in mind the above after storage and reactivation both r1 and r2 ags recovered their original capabilities they had before storage 10 basically granules have probably preserved a memory effect therefore in r1 they mainly performed a bio adsorption process whereas in r2 granules also performed a biodegradation of the bio adsorbed tphs this behaviour is consistent with the model proposed by wan et al 2014 18 which proved that when microorganisms are in unfavourable environments such as in presence of low temperatures nutrient deficiency toxic compounds high osmotic pressure they could have a very low metabolic activity thus stopping the anabolism and the growing and entering in a viable but non culturable vbnc status in these conditions granules can be stored for long term period without severe bioactivity loss after reactivation 3 5 bacterial community structures of ags and predicted cellular and metabolic functionalities in order to study the effect of granule storage conditions and to infer insights on bacterial metabolic capabilities the bacterial community structures of r1 and r2 ags were investigated through ngs of 16s rdna amplicons obtained from metagenomic dna for such reasons granules were sampled from both reactors at the beginning of reactivation day 0 and at the end of slop dosage day 40 alpha diversity indexes increased from day 0 to day 40 in both reactors and were higher in r2 in comparison with r1 table s1 therefore an influence of storage conditions was observed in addition to a dynamic shaping of bacterial community complexity during slop treatment to corroborate this assessment only 107 out of 1670 otus were shared between r1 and r2 at overall assayed time points figure s2 moreover 116 and 224 otus were always present in r1 and r2 during slop treatment respectively thus indicating that a pool of bacterial core strains was reactivated and was maintained in the granules figure s2 indeed proteobacteria phylum predominated at the end of treatment reaching 56 and 69 of all bacterial species in r1 and r2 respectively at the expense of bacteroidetes which were largely present at day 0 fig 6 a besides proteobacteria increment a r2 specific increment was observed for bacteria belonging to actinobacteria and firmicutes phyla at the genus level fig 6b xanthomarina of the flavobacteriaceae family was the most represented genus at day 0 relative abundances of 68 8 in r1 and 37 4 in r2 and it was strictly related to hydrocarbon removal in marine environment 46 48 however its abundance profile clearly indicated a decrease during slop treatment in both reactors relative abundances of 38 in r1 and 17 4 in r2 shown in fig 6b table s2 on the contrary the marinobacter and tropicibacter genera belonging to the proteobacteria showed a dramatic increment more than 20 and 5 fold respectively starting from less than 1 in both reactors thus representing specific treats of mature ags interestingly the marinobacter spp have been previously associated with removal of hydrocarbons from oil polluted marine water 49 50 in addition tropicibacter naphthalenivorans strain of tropicibacter genus has been associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degrading activity 51 and the capacity of degrading phthalate 52 from polluted seawater this observed shift from oil degrading bacteria belonging to bacteroidetes phylum day 0 for r1 and r2 to oil degrading bacteria belonging to proteobacteria phylum day 40 for r1 and r2 could be likely due to the different composition of fed slop wastewater before and after ags storage this could have implied the growth of other microbial groups involved in the degradation of recalcitrant hydrocarbons moreover the day 40 in r2 it was reported the presence of typical oil polluted seawater associated bacterial genera showing a greater abundance i e at least 2 fold in comparison with both the stored activated r2 granules day 0 and the r1 reactor day 0 and day 40 among these bacterial genera the most represented ones having at least 1 abundancy were on one hand the poorly characterized proteiniclasticum 5 1 and alkalibacterium 1 1 and on the other hand the genera idiomarina 4 3 seohaeicola 3 8 marinobacterium 3 7 halomonas 3 6 nitratireductor 1 5 pusillimonas 1 2 arcobacter 1 1 alcanivorax 1 1 and marinicella 1 0 that have all been previously and recently characterized for their hydrocarbon degrading capabilities 49 53 63 on the contrary following the same criteria described above the r1 most characterizing genus was pseudomonas 3 4 whose members produces eps possessing well known emulsifying property 64 65 thus this reactor specific distribution of bacterial genera was consistent with the marked tph biodegrading activity observed in case of r2 and the biosorption activity seen in r1 in addition to infer the potential metabolic abilities and dynamic changes thereof a picrust analysis based on bacterial community composition was conducted at two different depths of analysis according to kegg pathway database 66 level 2 and level 3 tables s3 s4 this analysis revealed that the bacterial communities of both reactors possess the metabolic potential for recalcitrant compound degradation such as aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbons tables s3 s4 differential sets of putative metabolic capabilities among bacterial communities were observed by comparing i each reactor during slop treatment i e day 0 vs day 40 and ii r1 and r2 at the corresponding time points i e day 0 r1 vs day 0 r2 and day 40 r1 vs day 40 r2 in particular among the most represented i e 1 functional gene classes from level 2 analysis three of them had a 1 2 fold variation along time they were i cell motility ii membrane transport and iii signal transduction classes which increased from day 0 to day 40 in both r1 and r2 with r2 showing the higher abundance values table s3 a more detailed study at kegg level 3 of the aforementioned differentially represented functional classes pointed out i bacterial chemotaxis flagellar assembly and bacterial motility proteins ii abc transporters and general transporters iii two component system of signal transduction the observed variations of putative cell function capabilities well correlated with the observed parameters regarding granules structure and properties in terms of physical characteristics and removal efficiencies in fact membrane transport and signal transduction gene classes could be linked to the sensing of recalcitrant compound and their degradation as observed in r2 in addition the increment of genes taking part in cell motility could explain why reduction of granule diameter was observed fig 1c and d indeed besides abiotic agents breakage of granules and regranulation phenomenon could be due to bacterial migration and colonization of new organic or inorganic surfaces to produce new granules with nutrients and substrates richness acting as a driving force 4 general considerations three most remarkable results were obtained from the reactivation of ags after long term storage for 12 months at 4 c to treat real industrial slop wastewater the increase of vss and granular sludge dimensions highlighted the adaptation of microorganisms to slop wastewater in both the cases r1 and r2 the epss production during the slop wastewater feeding was higher for granules cultivated with synthethic wastewater r1 compared to granules cultivated with slop wastewater r2 epss production by bacteria is often associated to a response of microorganisms to an environmental stress that in this case is represented by the recalcitrant slop wastewater characterized by high salinity and hydrocarbons the less epss production for r2 suggested that the ags cultivated with slop wastewater was enriched in microorganisms adapted to the industrial wastewater and able to biodegrade recalcitrant compounds the previous consideration was confirmed by the reported results about the organic matter removal the tphs removal and the analysis of microbial community regarding the organic matter removal in r2 the toc removal efficiency was not affected by the slop dosage and a removal efficiency close to 90 was maintained throughout the whole experimental period moreover specific tphs analyses revealed that hydrocarbons were biodegraded in r2 this latter evidence was confirmed by the microbial community analysis that showed a higher relative abundance of typical oil polluted seawater associated bacterial genera in r2 in comparison with the granules of r1 5 conclusions ags were reactivated after a long term storage for 12 months at 4 c to treat real slop wastewater in two sequencing batch airlift reactors in the first one r1 the stored aerobic granules have been previously salt adapted and subjected to a step wise increase of hydrocarbons whereas in the second one r2 the stored aerobic granules have been previously cultivated directly in simultaneous presence of salinity and hydrocarbons reactivation of ags allowed the recovery of granules removal abilities they had before the long term storage mass balance calculations revealed that in r1 the main tphs removal pathway was the bio adsorption whereas in r2 it was also observed a biodegradation of the bio adsorbed tphs thus resulting in an improved slop treatment efficiency these results were corroborated by ngs analysis of 16s rdna amplicons that revealed the presence of typical oil polluted seawater associated bacteria in r2 that probably played key roles in tphs emulsification biosorption and biodegradation declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements we thank

13436,this work reports on reactivation of aerobic granular sludge ags for the treatment of industrial recalcitrant wastewater slop wastewater characterized by high salinity and hydrocarbons ags were reactivated in two reactors r1 and r2 to treat industrial slop wastewater after a long term storage for 12 months at 4 c in r1 salt adapted mature aerobic granules were previously subjected to a step wise increase of hydrocarbons whereas in r2 aerobic granules were previously cultivated in presence of salinity and hydrocarbons after a short term reactivation period the slop dosage caused a simultaneous decrease of granules dimensions and proteins polysaccharides pn ps ratio down to 1 76 r1 and 2 35 r2 then the increase of granules dimensions and of the pn ps ratio up to 5 63 r1 and 4 22 r2 suggested a new granulation process the difference in total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs removal efficiencies 87 r1 and 97 r2 was mainly due to a biodegradation effect in r2 where granules were previously cultivated with slop this was confirmed by a simultaneous decrease of tphs concentration in the bulk and adsorbed into granules based on next generation sequencing of metagenomic 16s encoding genes in r2 typical oil polluted seawater associated bacteria were detected which probably played key roles in tphs biodegradation keywords aerobic granular sludge reactivation industrial wastewater tph hydrocarbon eps ngs 16s rdna 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags technology is a promising and effective biofilm system having the capability to treat both domestic and industrial wastewater by means of self aggregated microorganisms 1 3 the main feature of ags technology arises from the biofilm stratification and microbial diversity present in each granule the coexistence of i heterotrophic microorganisms for organic matter removal and heterothrophic denitrification ii autotrophic microorganisms such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob for nitrogen conversions and iii phosphorous accumulating microorganisms pao for phosphorous removal allows the simultaneous removal of carbon nitrogen and phosphorous in each aerobic granule 4 5 another relevant aspect of ags technology is represented by the bio adsorption capacity towards metals and recalcitrant particulate matter commonly present in industrial wastewater through extracellular polymeric substances eps 6 9 furthermore bio adsorption increases the contact time between microorganisms and recalcitrant contaminants thus increasing the biodegradation potential 10 for the aforementioned reasons an increasing interest has been expressed for the treatment of industrial wastewater with ags 3 11 the cultivation of granular sludge with industrial wastewater is possible and preferable in comparison with synthetic medium since it leads to the development of aerobic granules made of specialized microorganisms able to biodegrade recalcitrant compounds 10 12 13 however the loss of granules stability is the main drawback that hampers the scale up of the technology 14 especially when treating industrial wastewater a breakage of granules in a full scale ags plant may imply the loss of solid matters in the effluent and a drop in removal efficiencies thus generating a severe environmental impact 2 14 furthermore both cultivation and adaptation of microorganisms to the recalcitrant compounds are gradual processes that could require a step wise increase of influent pollutants concentration even for several months 10 15 bearing in mind the above the possibility to store pre cultivated and stable mature aerobic granules to be reactivated after a long period is focusing the interest of several researches 16 26 past studies revealed that a long term storage of aerobic granular sludge could imply a loss of structural stability and biological activity mainly due to cell and proteins hydrolysis 27 storage at high temperature causes high hydrolysis whereas low temperatures i e 4 c or freezing at 20 c 25 c could hamper cell and protein hydrolysis thus resulting in a maintenance and preservation of granules stability 28 29 regarding the freezing technique of the aerobic granules many authors found that after thawing the frozen ags the maintenance of structural integrity and the prompt recovery of biological activity were observed 17 24 25 in particular a prolonged storage of frozen aerobic granules is possible because most microbial activities stop but storing at low temperatures is an expensive practice because it requires high energy consumption and operating costs thus hampering the application at large scale however the study of storage reactivation techniques of ags and the understanding of the maintenance of structural stability and the recovery of both physical and biological characteristics of granular biomasses are important for full scale applications of ags technology the direct advantage that could be associated to this practice is represented by the shortening of the start up period of full scale ags plants to the best of the authors knowledge researches about storage and reactivation of aerobic granular sludge are dealt with synthethic wastewater and to date there are no works dealing about storage and reactivation of ags for the treatment of real industrial wastewater characterized by high salinity and contaminated by hydrocarbons slop wastewater the main objective and the novelty of this work are represented by the reactivation of aerobic granular sludge for the treatment of industrial recalcitrant slop wastewater characterized by high salinity and hydrocarbons the effects of long term storage for 12 months at 4 c have been analysed on two different aerobic granular biomasses the first one was cultivated with synthetic wastewater the second one was cultivated with slop wastewater both the reactivated aerobic granular sludges were studied in terms of treatment performances of real industrial slop wastewater attention was paid to granules structure and stability eps production pollutants removal efficiencies bacterial community composition in silico predicted cellular and metabolic capabilities 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of aerobic granular sludge the aerobic granular sludges used in this experimental work were cultivated in bench scale sequencing batch airlift reactors sbars hereinafter named r1 and r2 figure s1 having a working volume of 3 5 l and a height diameter h d ratio of 10 as reported in a previous study 10 the two sbars were inoculated in a previous experimental campaign lasted 150 days of operation 10 with different granular biomasses r1 was inoculated with granules cultivated with synthetic medium in a saline environment and subsequently adapted to hydrocarbons contained in slop wastewater r2 was inoculated with granules cultivated with slop thus simultaneously adapted to salinity and hydrocarbons both the reactors were operated in 6 hs cycles comprising 20 min feeding 320 333 min aeration 15 2 min settling and 5 min effluent discharge the volumetric exchange ratio ver was fixed at 50 and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h 2 2 storage conditions after 150 days of operation in a previous experimental campaign 10 the aerobic granules of both the reactors immersed into saline slop wastewater were transferred into two 5 l dark glass bottles the bottles were sealed and stored for 12 months at 4 c in a certified cold room 2 3 reactivation procedure after the long term storage the aerobic granular sludges were reactivated in the sbars described in the 2 1 section the objective was to evaluate the reactivation of microbial metabolisms of ags bacteria after a long term period of storage 12 months at 4 c before starting up the reactors the stored granules were washed for five times with saline water at the same salt concentration of slop to avoid the occurrence of osmotic stress for the microbial cells of ags then the washed granules were seeded into each reactor and they were subjected to an initial reactivation 12 days with synthetic saline wastewater followed by the treatment of real slop wastewater 2 4 wastewater composition and operational conditions shipboard slop wastewater after de oiling pre treatment were characterized by a total chemical oxygen demand codt of 816 94 mg l 1 a soluble chemical oxygen demand cods of 530 32 mg l 1 a total organic carbon toc of 390 3 mg l 1 total petroleum hydrocarbons tphs of 151 3 mg l 1 salinity of 37 8 1 5 g nacl l 1 and a ph of 7 78 0 62 during the first 12 days both the stored aerobic granular sludges were subjected to a reactivation phase where the feeding was a saline synthetic medium characterized by the stoichiometric proportions used by beun et al 2002 30 in addition nacl was manually added to obtain the same salinity of slop wastewater 37 8 gnacl l 1 this preliminary dosage of synthetic medium was performed to enhance the reactivation of biomass after the long term storage of 12 months at 4 c then once granules recovered the removal efficiencies of organic matter only real slop wastewater was fed to the reactors 2 5 analytical procedures all the analytical procedures were performed according to a previous research by campo and di bella 2019 10 a detailed description is provided in the annexed supplementary material 2 6 next generation sequencing ngs of 16s rdna amplicons and analysis metagenomic deoxyribonucleic acid dna used for characterization of the bacterial communities in r1 and r2 was extracted from samples collected at day 0 start of reactivation phase and day 40 fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals irvine ca usa was used for dna extraction following the protocol provided by the manufacturer and using about 100 mg of granules as starting material after harvesting of samples from reactors all subsequent procedures were performed in sterile conditions to avoid contamination with environmental microorganisms all details about polymerase chain reaction pcr ngs procedures bioinformatic and computational analysis of microbiological data are accurately described in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical properties of granules fig 1 shows the trends of tss and vss for r1 fig 1a and r2 fig 1b in r1 the initial granular biomass concentration was 1 4 gvss l 1 and the vss tss ratio was close to 58 at the end of the reactivation phase the vss concentration increased up to 3 gvss l 1 highlighting a net growth of biomass yield likely due to the biological reactivation of microbial metabolism however when slop was fed to the system a decrease of the vss concentration down to 1 72 gvss l 1 was observed suggesting an initial metabolic inhibition due to the substitution of the readily biodegradable substrate sodium acetate with a recalcitrant substrate slop wastewater the decreasing trend proceeded down to 1 19 gvss l 1 with a minimum of 34 of the vss tss ratio denoting an inhibitory effect of the recalcitrant substrate towards the microbial metabolism of ags then a gradual increase of solids concentration and vss tss ratio up to 2 66 gvss l 1 and 66 respectively suggested an adaptation of microorganisms to the hydrocarbons of slop in r2 similar trends of solids concentration were observed basically the initial granular biomass concentration was close to 1 gvss l 1 and the vss tss ratio was 62 granular biomass grew during the reactivation phase up to 2 gvss l 1 day 12 also in this case the slop dosage determined an initial decrease of metabolic capability of ags microorganisms that resulted in a decrease of volatile suspended solids down to 1 15 gvss l 1 day 14 until the day 26 after that a gradual increase of biomass concentration from 1 11 gvss l 1 up to 2 31 gvss l 1 suggested a metabolic adaptation of microorganisms to the recalcitrant substrate of slop regarding the granules dimensions a particle size distribution psd analysis was assessed for both r1 fig 1c and r2 fig 1d a psd analysis for granular sludge systems is indicative of structural stability of granular biomasses through the monitoring of the variations of characteristic diameters of granules 10 in particular after an initial increase of d50 during the reactivation phase from 1 23 to 1 33 mm for r1 and from 0 89 to 1 11 mm for r2 the slop dosage provoked a partial breakage of granules in both the systems and a decrease of d50 down to 0 78 mm and 0 58 mm in r1 and r2 respectively this was a further evidence of an initial inhibition of ags microorganisms but this did not imply a leakage of solids in the effluents that resulted below 0 5 mg l 1 in both the reactors as shown in fig 1 a b therefore although a partial breakage of granules was observed the fragments of broken granules had high settling properties and the majority of them was retained inside the sbars then the d50 increased again up to 0 96 mm and 0 93 mm for r1 and r2 respectively furthermore in r1 and in r2 both d10 and d90 followed the same trend of d50 however in r1 the granulation rate was always 100 and the lowest value of d10 was 0 39 mm day 26 higher than the value of 200 μm conventionally known as the threshold for ags 31 although in r2 the lowest value of d10 was 0 23 mm day 26 higher than the ags threshold value of 200 μm the granulation rate of that operational day was close to 95 small aggregates not properly granules having diameters between the 0 10 mm and 0 20 mm dimensional classes were present in r2 on day 26 with a distribution frequency of 5 21 however their settling velocity was higher than the fixed settling time for the sbar thus resulting in an almost complete retention inside the reactor as discussed previously about tssout then a full granular system was restored in r2 and the granulation rate increased up to 100 until the end of the experimental period in order to support the previous considerations fig 2 shows the images of aerobic granules in r1 and r2 throughout all the experimental period noteworthy after the long term storage for 12 months at 4 c into the slop wastewater granules in r1 fig 2a and in r2 fig 2b appeared with a reddish color and round shaped without any deterioration of the morphology and structure this confirmed the results achieved by other authors about stored aerobic granules in synthetic medium 18 24 25 after the reactivation phase granules appeared with a larger dimension fig 1c d and with smoother edges in r1 fig 2c and in r2 fig 2d subsequently the slop dosage caused a change of granules color from reddish to brownish and provoked a breakage of ags thus reaching its peak the day 26 in both the systems fig 2e for r1 and fig 2f for r2 as discussed previously however in r2 the breakage occurred in a greater extent compared to r1 as visible in fig 2f and as discussed previously by studying the particle size distribution of aerobic granules in fact some granules lost their stability resulting in breakages of their original structures nevertheless as discussed previously the single fragments of broken granules were retained inside the bioreactors and they constituted new nucleation points for a new granulation process 32 that occurred for the remaining days of operation fig 2g h 3 2 soluble microbial products smps and extracellular polymeric substances epss production interesting results were registered in terms of soluble microbial products smps and epss production the analysis of the existing literature revealed that when microorganisms are in presence of environmental stresses or inhibitory agents they produce high amounts of smps and epss that might help bacteria to protect themselves and to cope with the stress 33 34 regarding the smps fig 3 a b it possible to see that in both the reactors no significant production of smps was registered during the reactivation phase when the systems were fed with synthetic saline wastewater with sodium acetate as sole carbon source therefore the salt adapted granules did not undergo any environmental stress and the production of soluble microbial products was quite low as also observed by dong et al 2017 35 then when slop was fed to the reactors in r1 a gradual increase of proteins smps was registered up to 91 mg gvss 1 day 26 the dense and compact granules of r1 produced more smps as response to the metabolic stress caused by the recalcitrant substrate after that a slight decrease of protein smps down to 72 mg gvss 1 suggested an adaptation of biomass to the environmental conditions by observing the r2 data after the slop dosage a sudden peak of protein smp up to 120 mg gvss 1 was registered in this case the less dense granules immediately responded to recalcitrant compounds hydrocarbons by producing a higher amount of protein smp compared to r1 then also in this case the gradual decrease of smps down to 89 mg gvss 1 day 34 was likely due to the adaptation of microorganisms to the industrial recalcitrant slop feeding regarding to the bound eps fig 3c d it should be highlighted that the day of reactivation day 0 after the long term storage for 12 months at 4 c into the slop wastewater values of 51 mg gvss 1 and 47 mg gvss 1 of protein epss and values of 22 mg gvss 1 and 17 mg gvss 1 of polysaccharides epss were registered for r1 and r2 respectively these specific concentrations are surprising if one considers that granules were simply stored at 4 c immersed into the industrial slop wastewater and without oxygen supply an explaination of this phenomenon is attributable to the eps content of ags epss have a crucial role in constituting a gelatinous matrix that promote the aggregation of microorganisms thus promoting ags formation and ensuring granules structural stability and integrity 36 37 therefore epss represent a protective barrier for the cells 38 39 and may have preserved both proteins and polysaccharides content during the long term storage of ags at 4 c in literature mcswain et al 2005 36 found that the stability of granules was dependent on a proteins core whereas seviour et al 2012 40 discovered that polysaccharides was in favour of the gel forming and formation of granular sludge therefore by applying the aforementioned storage conditions granules were able to maintain their structure as shown in fig 2a b this was mainly due to the preservation of the proteins and the polysaccharides in the granule bound epss matrix that conferred a structuring and a cohesive function to microbial cells of granules the pn ps ratio of granular sludge epss has been monitored as a further indicative parameter of structural stability of ags 41 in fact a higher pn ps ratio of eps contributes to increase the hydrophobicity of the aggregates thus promoting the microbial aggregation and enhancing granular sludge stability 42 43 the pn ps ratios observed in both the reactors during the start up day 0 were close to 2 29 and 2 76 for r1 and r2 respectively thus denoting the dominance of the structuring protein fraction of epss 44 subsequently granules enforced their stability and this is confirmed by the increase of the pn ps ratios up to 3 88 and 5 15 for r1 and r2 respectively at the same time as granules became structurally more stable they produced less bound epss at the end of the reactivation phase after the dosage of the slop wastewater a collapse of the pn ps ratios down to 1 76 for r1 and 2 35 for r2 mainly due to a decrease of protein content determined a weakening of granules structure thus leading to the breakage as discussed previously then different behaviors were observed in the reactors in r1 granules reacted by increasing the bound proteins production from 18 to 56 mg gvss 1 day 26 and consequently the pn ps ratio increased up to 4 52 this implied a rapid re granulation process thus suggesting the overcoming of the inhibitory effect of the recalcitrant compounds of the slop wastewater on microbial metabolism finally once new granules were formed day 34 a less production of granule bound epss was observed and the pn ps ratio further increased up to 5 63 due to a maturation of the new formed granules on the other hand in r2 the granule bound epss content remained almost constant until the day 26 and the re granulation process was slower if compared to r1 also in this case a reduction of granule bound epss production was observed at the end of operation and an increase of pn ps ratio up to 4 22 denoted a strengthening of granules structure as also observed by zhu et al 2015 44 3 3 organic matter removal in fig 4 the organic matter removal efficiencies in terms of codt cods and toc are shown looking at the codt fig 4a b in r1 after the reactivation period where a removal efficiency of 53 was obtained the slop dosage implied a gradual increase of the effluent codt concentration and led to a low removal efficiency close to 20 at the end of operation this suggested that initially microorganisms were not able to biodegrade the recalcitrant fraction of slop likely due to presence of hydrocarbons that exerted an inhibitory effect also in r2 a slight increase of the effluent codt concentration was observed when slop was dosed to the reactor however the codt effluent concentration remained almost constant until the end of operation achieving a removal efficiency close to 40 regarding the cods fig 4c d in r1 a similar trend to codt was observed thus confirming the inhibition of metabolism of microorganisms likely due to the presence of hydrocarbons and a cods removal efficiency close to 28 was registered however in r2 after the initial increase of the effluent cods concentration due to the slop dosage a gradual decrease of effluent concentration was registered until the end of operation thus achieving a removal efficiency close to 59 this trend suggested a gradual metabolic adaptation and acclimatization of ags microorganisms to the recalcitrant substrate another important information is given by the toc analysis fig 4e f that has shown more regular trends in r1 after the slop dosage a decrease of the toc removal efficiency from 90 to 57 was registered day 22 then a progressive recovery of the removal efficiencies until the end of the study was observed this suggested an initial inhibition and a subsequent progressive adaptation of ags microorganisms to the environmental conditions in r2 a completely different response was registered in terms of toc removal the slop dosage did not affect the toc removal efficiency that was maintained close to 90 throughout the whole experimental period this suggested that in r2 biomass did not undergo a metabolic inhibition when slop was fed to the reactors moreover granules in r1 removed the recalcitrant organic matter mainly through a physical bio adsorption while in r2 the cultivation of granules with slop wastewater 10 also implied a biological selection of bacteria composing the ags biofilm thus enhancing the growth of specialized microorganisms able to degrade the recalcitrant substrate however after the long term storage and the subsequent reactivation in both the reactors granules recovered their original functionalities 3 4 tph removal the main objective of this work was to evaluate the ags reactivation after storage for 12 months at 4 c for the treatment of slop wastewater regarding the tph removal fig 5 shows a comparative analysis of tph removal in liquid phase fig 5a and adsorbed in solid phase fig 5b for r1 and r2 respectively in particular both the reactors removed tph thus confirming the effectiveness of ags technology for the treatment of recalcitrant substrates however by comparing the obtained results in liquid phase of both the reactors fig 5a it is possible to see that in r1 an initial decrease of tph removal efficiency from 80 down to 66 day 26 confirmed an initial metabolic inhibition of ags microorganisms when slop was fed to the reactor then the system gradually increased its removal efficiency up to 87 at the end of experimentation however the discharge limit imposed by the marpol 73 78 45 for tph 5 mg l 1 was not fulfilled and an effluent concentration of 19 5 mgtph l 1 was obtained at the end of the study on the other hand r2 provided better tph removal efficiencies than r1 showing a continuously increasing trend of tph removal efficiency from 80 to more than 95 moreover starting from the day 35 the tph effluent concentration was lower than the discharge limit of 5 mgtph l 1 although the regranulation process resulted slower in r2 the tph removal efficiency was higher than in r1 and complied with the law limits therefore the ags cultivated directly with slop wastewater r2 demonstrated better performances treating the recalcitrant industrial slop wastewater also after a long term storage of granules bearing in mind the above the cultivation of ags with the industrial wastewater to treat as occurred for r2 is highly recommended moreover the cultivation of ags with synthetic wastewater as occurred for r1 is not applicable in full scale mainly due to the high operational costs of reagents further interesting results were obtained by analyzing the adsorbed fraction of tph into the granules surface fig 5b it is quite evident that in r1 the main tph removal mechanism was the bio adsorption while in r2 the simultaneous decrease of the tph concentrations in liquid phase and adsorbed in solid phase suggested that the main tph removal pathway was the biodegradation of the bio adsorbed fraction of hydrocarbons the previous results were confirmed by the analysis of hydrocarbons speciation both in liquid and in solid granules phases performed at the end of the study day 40 for r1 fig 5c and r2 fig 5d respectively in r1 the higher effluent hydrocarbons concentrations were likely due to the progressive saturation of the bio adsorbent sites of granules and to a probable de sorption phenomenon given the high hydrocarbons concentration gradient between the granules surface and the bulk liquid on the other hand in r2 both the trends of the adsorbed and the effluent tph concentrations suggested a continuous bio adsorption hydrolysis and biodegradation of the adsorbed fractions thus implying a continuous regeneration of the bio adsorbent sites that were available for new hydrocarbons adsorption bearing in mind the above after storage and reactivation both r1 and r2 ags recovered their original capabilities they had before storage 10 basically granules have probably preserved a memory effect therefore in r1 they mainly performed a bio adsorption process whereas in r2 granules also performed a biodegradation of the bio adsorbed tphs this behaviour is consistent with the model proposed by wan et al 2014 18 which proved that when microorganisms are in unfavourable environments such as in presence of low temperatures nutrient deficiency toxic compounds high osmotic pressure they could have a very low metabolic activity thus stopping the anabolism and the growing and entering in a viable but non culturable vbnc status in these conditions granules can be stored for long term period without severe bioactivity loss after reactivation 3 5 bacterial community structures of ags and predicted cellular and metabolic functionalities in order to study the effect of granule storage conditions and to infer insights on bacterial metabolic capabilities the bacterial community structures of r1 and r2 ags were investigated through ngs of 16s rdna amplicons obtained from metagenomic dna for such reasons granules were sampled from both reactors at the beginning of reactivation day 0 and at the end of slop dosage day 40 alpha diversity indexes increased from day 0 to day 40 in both reactors and were higher in r2 in comparison with r1 table s1 therefore an influence of storage conditions was observed in addition to a dynamic shaping of bacterial community complexity during slop treatment to corroborate this assessment only 107 out of 1670 otus were shared between r1 and r2 at overall assayed time points figure s2 moreover 116 and 224 otus were always present in r1 and r2 during slop treatment respectively thus indicating that a pool of bacterial core strains was reactivated and was maintained in the granules figure s2 indeed proteobacteria phylum predominated at the end of treatment reaching 56 and 69 of all bacterial species in r1 and r2 respectively at the expense of bacteroidetes which were largely present at day 0 fig 6 a besides proteobacteria increment a r2 specific increment was observed for bacteria belonging to actinobacteria and firmicutes phyla at the genus level fig 6b xanthomarina of the flavobacteriaceae family was the most represented genus at day 0 relative abundances of 68 8 in r1 and 37 4 in r2 and it was strictly related to hydrocarbon removal in marine environment 46 48 however its abundance profile clearly indicated a decrease during slop treatment in both reactors relative abundances of 38 in r1 and 17 4 in r2 shown in fig 6b table s2 on the contrary the marinobacter and tropicibacter genera belonging to the proteobacteria showed a dramatic increment more than 20 and 5 fold respectively starting from less than 1 in both reactors thus representing specific treats of mature ags interestingly the marinobacter spp have been previously associated with removal of hydrocarbons from oil polluted marine water 49 50 in addition tropicibacter naphthalenivorans strain of tropicibacter genus has been associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degrading activity 51 and the capacity of degrading phthalate 52 from polluted seawater this observed shift from oil degrading bacteria belonging to bacteroidetes phylum day 0 for r1 and r2 to oil degrading bacteria belonging to proteobacteria phylum day 40 for r1 and r2 could be likely due to the different composition of fed slop wastewater before and after ags storage this could have implied the growth of other microbial groups involved in the degradation of recalcitrant hydrocarbons moreover the day 40 in r2 it was reported the presence of typical oil polluted seawater associated bacterial genera showing a greater abundance i e at least 2 fold in comparison with both the stored activated r2 granules day 0 and the r1 reactor day 0 and day 40 among these bacterial genera the most represented ones having at least 1 abundancy were on one hand the poorly characterized proteiniclasticum 5 1 and alkalibacterium 1 1 and on the other hand the genera idiomarina 4 3 seohaeicola 3 8 marinobacterium 3 7 halomonas 3 6 nitratireductor 1 5 pusillimonas 1 2 arcobacter 1 1 alcanivorax 1 1 and marinicella 1 0 that have all been previously and recently characterized for their hydrocarbon degrading capabilities 49 53 63 on the contrary following the same criteria described above the r1 most characterizing genus was pseudomonas 3 4 whose members produces eps possessing well known emulsifying property 64 65 thus this reactor specific distribution of bacterial genera was consistent with the marked tph biodegrading activity observed in case of r2 and the biosorption activity seen in r1 in addition to infer the potential metabolic abilities and dynamic changes thereof a picrust analysis based on bacterial community composition was conducted at two different depths of analysis according to kegg pathway database 66 level 2 and level 3 tables s3 s4 this analysis revealed that the bacterial communities of both reactors possess the metabolic potential for recalcitrant compound degradation such as aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbons tables s3 s4 differential sets of putative metabolic capabilities among bacterial communities were observed by comparing i each reactor during slop treatment i e day 0 vs day 40 and ii r1 and r2 at the corresponding time points i e day 0 r1 vs day 0 r2 and day 40 r1 vs day 40 r2 in particular among the most represented i e 1 functional gene classes from level 2 analysis three of them had a 1 2 fold variation along time they were i cell motility ii membrane transport and iii signal transduction classes which increased from day 0 to day 40 in both r1 and r2 with r2 showing the higher abundance values table s3 a more detailed study at kegg level 3 of the aforementioned differentially represented functional classes pointed out i bacterial chemotaxis flagellar assembly and bacterial motility proteins ii abc transporters and general transporters iii two component system of signal transduction the observed variations of putative cell function capabilities well correlated with the observed parameters regarding granules structure and properties in terms of physical characteristics and removal efficiencies in fact membrane transport and signal transduction gene classes could be linked to the sensing of recalcitrant compound and their degradation as observed in r2 in addition the increment of genes taking part in cell motility could explain why reduction of granule diameter was observed fig 1c and d indeed besides abiotic agents breakage of granules and regranulation phenomenon could be due to bacterial migration and colonization of new organic or inorganic surfaces to produce new granules with nutrients and substrates richness acting as a driving force 4 general considerations three most remarkable results were obtained from the reactivation of ags after long term storage for 12 months at 4 c to treat real industrial slop wastewater the increase of vss and granular sludge dimensions highlighted the adaptation of microorganisms to slop wastewater in both the cases r1 and r2 the epss production during the slop wastewater feeding was higher for granules cultivated with synthethic wastewater r1 compared to granules cultivated with slop wastewater r2 epss production by bacteria is often associated to a response of microorganisms to an environmental stress that in this case is represented by the recalcitrant slop wastewater characterized by high salinity and hydrocarbons the less epss production for r2 suggested that the ags cultivated with slop wastewater was enriched in microorganisms adapted to the industrial wastewater and able to biodegrade recalcitrant compounds the previous consideration was confirmed by the reported results about the organic matter removal the tphs removal and the analysis of microbial community regarding the organic matter removal in r2 the toc removal efficiency was not affected by the slop dosage and a removal efficiency close to 90 was maintained throughout the whole experimental period moreover specific tphs analyses revealed that hydrocarbons were biodegraded in r2 this latter evidence was confirmed by the microbial community analysis that showed a higher relative abundance of typical oil polluted seawater associated bacterial genera in r2 in comparison with the granules of r1 5 conclusions ags were reactivated after a long term storage for 12 months at 4 c to treat real slop wastewater in two sequencing batch airlift reactors in the first one r1 the stored aerobic granules have been previously salt adapted and subjected to a step wise increase of hydrocarbons whereas in the second one r2 the stored aerobic granules have been previously cultivated directly in simultaneous presence of salinity and hydrocarbons reactivation of ags allowed the recovery of granules removal abilities they had before the long term storage mass balance calculations revealed that in r1 the main tphs removal pathway was the bio adsorption whereas in r2 it was also observed a biodegradation of the bio adsorbed tphs thus resulting in an improved slop treatment efficiency these results were corroborated by ngs analysis of 16s rdna amplicons that revealed the presence of typical oil polluted seawater associated bacteria in r2 that probably played key roles in tphs emulsification biosorption and biodegradation declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements we thank

13437,this study aimed to evaluate the ion exchange and biosorption of al3 using as biosorbent material residual biomass generated in the alginate extraction process from the brown algae s filipendula named res the batch mode results showed that ion exchange mainly with na ions has important participation in the removal of al3 ions by res characterization analyses and blocking assays indicated that carboxylic amino and sulfonate functional groups play a key role on the al3 biosorption the dynamic system in a fixed packed bed column and the reuse regeneration of the biosorbent was assessed by breakthrough method fixed bed experiments pointed that higher al3 removal was achieved at 0 5 ml min and 1 mmol l dualsd model showed superior prediction of experimental data biosorption desorption cycles demonstrated the reuse feasibility of the biosorbent which maintained a considerable adsorption capacity in all cycles performed keywords biosorption aluminum residue brown algae fixed bed 1 introduction in view of the current scenario of constant industrial expansion and consequently the increase in the pollution of water bodies by the discharge of contaminated effluents processes for the removal of pollutants have been increasingly investigated among the processes most used nowadays by the industry for the treatment of contaminated wastewaters generally chemical precipitation is the most applied mainly due to its operational simplicity nevertheless this method generates large amounts of highly contaminated sludge thus leading to the occurrence of secondary pollution therefore advanced methods with redefined approaches are necessary in search for a sustainable development of industrial expansion biosorption is an adsorption process that uses materials of biological origin as adsorbents biosorbents to remove various types of contaminants especially toxic metals 1 2 this technology stands out for being simple eco friendly inexpensive and at the same time flexible for scale up that is for the continuous treatment of large amounts of effluents contaminated with mild concentrations of metals aluminum is a hazardous metal widely used in several industrial processes e g mining metallurgic smelting and electroplating hence large amounts of wastewaters are found with significant concentrations of this metal 3 4 once they are generated quickly and in large quantities the treatment of these effluents requires a fast cheap and simple method such as biosorption and in this case the properties of the biosorbent material must also meet requirements such as having high availability and the lowest commercial value as possible there are several studies reported in the literature that uses different biomaterials for the removal of al3 such as microorganisms agro industrial residues and seaweeds 5 10 algae are known as promisors biosorbents for the removal of toxic metals due to their great affinity 11 especially brown algae stands out for having satisfactory al3 removal percentages when compared to green and red algae 9 the system studied in this research consists on the biosorption of al3 ions in an aqueous medium using as biosorbent the residue from the alginate extraction from the brown alga sargassum filipendula this biomaterial in addition to meeting the requirements previously mentioned is also considered promising for the uptake of toxic metals for having in its composition functional groups directly associated to the mechanism of toxic metals removal 12 previously studies highlighted the effectiveness of this biosorbent for removing metals such as cadmium zinc chromium and nickel 13 15 since it has no added value this waste here termed as res is usually discarded in the sea compared to other toxic metals a lack in literature for in depth investigations on al3 biosorption systems is found 16 in addition to that in previous works this residue biosorbent showed a remarkable affinity for al3 ions however this system had not yet completely studied 17 thus this metal was selected for this study this work has the objective to advance in understanding the mechanism of ion exchange involved in the biosorption of al3 using the residue through batch studies and characterizations of the biosorbent material before and after the process furthermore the viability efficiency of the process and the biosorbent regeneration in continuous system was also investigated all objectives meet at the point of explore an innovative accessible and feasible technology to remove al3 ions present in aqueous media in addition to helping to fill the niche found in the literature concerning al3 biosorption studies in a fixed bed dynamic system 2 material and methods 2 1 aluminum solution al3 solutions were prepared using analytical nonahydrate al3 nitrate al no3 3 9h2o dinâmica dissolved in deionized water at required concentrations and molar proportions 2 2 biosorbent obtainment the raw biomass of s filipendula was gathered at cigarra s beach on the north coast of são paulo brazil the seaweed was rinsed with deionized water repetitively and dried at 333 15 k for 24 h and refined at particles with diameter around 1 mm alginate removal was performed according to mchugh s methodology 18 the dealginated residue here termed as res generated from extraction operation was washed and dried 333 15 k 24 h in order to obtain fractions with diameter about 0 737 mm the biosorbent was sieved through 12 16 and 32 mesh screens 2 3 biosorbent characterization characterization analyses were carried out on the residue before res and after res al biosorption in order to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the al3 uptake using this biomaterial to analyze the morphology and chemical composition of the biosorbent scanning electron microscopy with x ray dispersive energy sem edx leo 440i 6070 england was conducted the biosorbent was overlaid with a gold film 200 a before scanning the micrographs were obtained with 1000x magnification and the operating conditions were 50 pa and 15 kv for sem and 800 pa and 20 kv for edx analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was conducted to obtain information about the functional groups present on the surface of the biosorbent the analysis was performed in a spectrum range of 4000 to 500 cm 1 with scan resolution of 4 cm 1 using a nicolet 6700 spectrometer thermoscientific 2 4 ion exchange study the occurrence of ion exchange mechanisms is a characteristic of seaweed biomasses and are frequently involved on toxic metal removal 19 in view of the possible participation of these mechanisms in al3 biosorption the occurrence of this phenomenon was evaluated in kinetic studies that were conducted in order to determine the concentration profiles of the main light cations ca2 k mg2 and na involved in the removal of toxic metals using this biosorbent 13 for this purpose 1000 ml of a 3 mmol l al3 solution was treated with 2 g of residue at room temperature 298 15 k for 3 h under constant agitation 250 rpm aiming to avoid metal precipitation the solution ph was fixed at 4 and controlled using hno3 solutions 0 1 and 0 5 mmol l samples were collected at regular time intervals and the metal concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry aas shimadzu japan 2 5 esterification of functional groups to evaluate the participation of the main functional groups in the removal of al3 ions by the residue the esterification of these groups was performed the blocked functional groups were the carboxyl and sulfonate groups as they are notably the most involved in biosorption processes using algae derived biomasses 11 the esterification of the carboxylic groups was performed according to the methodology established by gardea torresdey et al 20 where 4 g of residue were added to a solution of 260 ml of methanol and 2 4 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid in constant agitation for 6 h at 298 15 k subsequently the biosorbent was rinsed with deionized water and dried at 333 15 k for 12 h this residue was named esterified waste res est for the esterification of sulfonate groups 1 g of the residue was put in contact to a mixture of 50 ml of methanol and 0 5 ml of hydrochloric acid under constant stirring for 48 h divided into 4 cycles where the methanol and hcl solution was replaced between cycles the residue termed blocked esterified residue res est blk was washed with deionized water and dried for 12 h at 333 15 k 21 blocking experiments were conducted in batch mode in an orbital shaker jeiotech si 600r with constant agitation 250 rpm and controlled temperature 298 15 k for 6 h the dosage of biosorbent was 2 g l for both biomasses in order to respect the acid constant pka of each group the tests were conducted at different ph for res est and res est blk according to sheng et al 22 brown algae carboxylic groups have pka in range of 3 5 5 whereas for sulfonate groups this value is between 1 and 2 5 so tests with the esterified residue were performed at ph 5 while for the esterified and blocked residue ph 2 was chosen to evaluate the adsorptive capacity of the residues in equilibrium qeq mmol g and the

were carried out in a glass column with 0 7 cm internal diameter and 7 cm height that was coupled to an automatic aliquot collector and to a peristaltic pump according to the diagram shown in fig 1s see supplementary material the experiments were made with 0 3 g of the biosorbent hydrated and expanded for 12 h in ultrapure milliq water and then used to fill the glass column the al3 solution was fed in ascending flow through the bed using the peristaltic pump masterflex the automatic collector fc 203 gilson was programmed to withdraw samples at regular intervals of time aiming to obtain the

parameters as the previous step qr qs ztm rr and rs were evaluated 2 7 2 biosorption desorption cycles once the optimal conditions were determined four sorption desorption cycles were conducted aiming to investigate the biomaterial regeneration potential the eluent solution was selected based on results from assays described in section 2 5 between each cycle the residue was washed in a continuous flow of deionized water for 1 h fixed bed parameters i e qr qs ztm rr and rs were calculated aiming to compare with results previously obtained 2 7 3 model evaluation mathematical modeling is used to describe the behavior of breakthrough curves assisting in the understanding and scale up of the system five different column adsorption models were adjusted to breakthrough curves data to explain the process of al3 biosorption by res in fixed bed configuration as follows yoon nelson 25 thomas 26 clark 27 yan et al 28 and dualsd 29 the mathematical models of yoon nelson thomas clark and yan et al are well established in the literature and the most commonly found to predict the dynamic behavior of biosorption systems while the dualsd model is more recent and based on the law of mass conservation 29 the yoon nelson model undertakes that the adsorption rate decreases proportionally to the removal of adsorbate and the rupture curve of the adsorbent disregarding information such as adsorbate properties type of adsorbent and specifications about the adsorption column thomas mathematical model presumes that intraparticle diffusion and external resistance to mass transfer are low therefore negligible and that the adsorption process is governed by the reversible kinetic model of pseudo second order with equilibrium described by the langmuir model while clark s model is based on the concepts of mass transfer and the freundlich isotherm in addition to assuming that the flow of the solution in the column behaves like a piston and discards the occurrence of dispersion 30 the empirical model proposed by yan et al minimizes possible errors in the application of the thomas model the dualsd model is based on linear driving force models and assumes that the biosorbent surface is formed by different types of adsorption sites therefore different kinetics behaviors can govern the process the equations for each model are listed in table 1 models adjustment to the experimental data were performed using maple 17 and origin 8 2 7 4 error analysis models adjustments were analyzed using the determination coefficients r² eq 9 and the corrected akaike information criteria aicc eq

characterization 3 1 1 ftir the understanding of functional groups involved in the biosorption of toxic metals is essential to elucidate the mechanism of this process groups such as carboxylic sulfonate hydroxyl and amine are among the major responsible for the metal uptake by algae biomaterials 31 in the case of the residue studied here its composition is very similar to the sargassum filipendula seaweed 12 in order to analyze the functional groups involved in the removal of al3 ions by res fig 1 shows the infrared spectrum of the unloaded a and al loaded b residue according to sheng et al 22 the broadband at 3000 3600 cm 1 corresponds to bindings related to the oh and nh groups the change observed in the peak of 3420 cm 1 of res to 3440 cm 1 in res al indicates that these groups have an active participation in the bonding with al3 ions the variation of bands from 1538 cm 1 to 1548 cm 1 after biosorption confirms the amino groups participation in the process the peaks identified in the region of 1639 cm 1 and 1404 cm 1 represent the coo m carboxylic salts where m refers to light metals as na k mg2 and ca2 21 the change to 1643 and 1462 cm 1 suggests that these metals are being exchanged for the metal of interest in this case al3 pointing to the occurrence of ion exchange mechanisms this result is confirmed by the ion exchange evaluation experiment discussed further in section 3 2 the peaks at 1057 and 1031 cm 1 are ascribed to co bonds of the alcoholic groups after the removal of al3 these values changed to 1059 and 1029 cm 1 respectively this subtle shift may reveal that coordination with the metal ions has minor participation in the mechanism of al3 uptake by res the band at 1111 01 cm 1 is related to the stretching of co of ether groups the variation to 1115 10 cm 1 after biosorption indicates that these bindings also have trivial participation in this system the band at 1164 cm 1 res and 1172 cm 1 res al is associated with sulfonic groups so and cso of fucoidan one of the main compounds of the brown alga s filipendula 32 the changes in peaks at 1256 cm 1 in res to 1233 cm 1 in res al are also linked to sulfonic functions the significant changes noted in these bands after the biosorption process point that sulfonic groups actively take part in the al3 complexation by res thus it can be inferred that carboxylic amino and sulfates groups are predominantly participating in the process of al3 removal using the residue the sharp peaks at 820 cm 1 res and 829 cm 1 res al are related to the participation of mannuronic groups which indicates the presence of remaining alginate from the extraction process 33 overall similar results are reported in the literature for res in the uptake of other toxic metals as for other biosorbents algae derived in the removal of al3 ions 1 9 10 34 35 3 1 2 sem edx fig 2 depicts the micrographs obtained for the residue before a and after b the biosorption of al3 in addition to showing the distribution of this metal on the surface of the biosorbent c moreover table 2 summarizes the chemical composition obtained by edx also for raw and al contaminated res from fig 2 a and b it can be noted that the biosorbent before and after biosorption has a very irregular rough surface with macropores and cracks many of these irregularities can be associated with damages caused by the process of alginate extraction since it is present in large percentage on the algal cell wall the presence of whitish spots pointed by the black arrows is associated with the phenomenon called calcium flowers covering the surface of the biomaterial that are remaining after removal of al confirming what can be seen in table 2 where the percentage of calcium in the residue decreases after biosorption but does not reach zero furthermore it is also possible to notice the presence of diatom shells indicated by black circles in the images these organisms are commonly found in seaweed and contain elements such as al s and mainly si the latter being responsible for the rigidity of the wall cell 36 thus it may justify the presence of these elements in the residue composition presented in table 2 in fig 2 c it is possible to visualize that the al3 ions are apparently distributed homogeneously on the surface of the biosorbent a result similar to that reported in other studies 37 38 analyzing table 2 it is possible to verify that in addition to c and o the element with the greatest presence in the composition of pure waste is sodium na the notable decrease in its percentage after the al3 biosorption process indicates the involvement of a mechanism ion exchange in removing the metal of interest in contrast to this behavior after biosorption an increase in the percentage of al3 is noted as expected indicating the possible participation of ion exchange mechanisms in al3 uptake by res ion exchange is usually identified as the main mechanism for the biosorption of metals in biosorbents derived from brown algae 11 in addition to that it is observed that despite the remarkable percentage of s and si these two elements appear to have little participation in the ion exchange mechanism the opposite is observed for mg2 and ca2 where after biosorption the presence of these elements was reduced substantially to almost zero similar results were obtained by freitas et al 38 and costa et al 12 analyzing the biosorption of other toxic metals by this same biomaterial other paper works also report the presence of other elements such as fe p and k that were not found by edx analysis in this study however bertagnolli et al 34 highlight that the composition of the alga is affected by factors such as the season of the year in which it was collected or the stage of its life cycle 3 2 investigation of ion exchange mechanism considering the results obtained by analyzing the chemical composition of the biosorbent experiments were carried out to evaluate the ion exchange between al3 and light metals such as na mg2 k and ca2 in the biosorption process using res the investigated metals were selected based on previously reports in the literature fig 3 shows the kinetic profile of ion exchange behavior obtained using a solution with an initial al3 concentration of 3 mmol l fig 3 makes explicit the exchange behavior between al3 ions and light metals linked to the functional groups on the biosorbent surface it can be observed that na ions concentration remarkable increases in the medium while al3 ions concentration decreases rapidly indicating that na ions were exchanged for al3 ions in the active sites on the biosorbent surface hence na stands out as the main exchangeable metal in the system followed by mg2 and ca2 this pattern is in accordance with that observed in table 2 of the previous section 3 1 2 although k was not presented in the quantification by edx it also seems to have such a small participation in the system s ion exchange mechanism the major exchange between na and al3 ions is also commonly observed in the biosorption of other metals by algae derived biosorbents 32 38 39 also the hard soft acid base hsba principle helps to clarify the connection between metals according to this theory metals like al3 na ca2 k and mg2 are classified as hard acids 40 according to gadd 40 hard cations exhibit greater electronegativity and low polarization and therefore tend to participate in electrostatic bonds with ligands of functional groups still following this theory al3 would form more stable complexes with hard binders that is oxygen containing ligands such as oh and co3 2 3 3 effect of functional groups esterification given the confirmation in the preceding section 3 1 1 of the broad participation of carboxylic and sulfonate groups in al3 biosorption using res and aiming to evaluate the influence of each one in the bonding of the metal in the biosorbent surface assays were carried out using res with these groups esterified table 3 presents the results obtained for the tests using the residue without modifications res at ph 4 and 2 for esterified residue res est at ph 4 and for esterified and blocked residue res est blk at ph 2 as aforementioned the ph values of the experiments were chosen based on the pka ph where the group has more active participation in the removal of metals of each blocked functional group it is well established in the literature that there is a great influence of ph in the adsorptive capacity and in the percentage of removal in biosorption processes this is confirmed by observing the results obtained for biosorption at ph 4 and ph 2 using the residue without modifications it is noted that there was a significant drop in the efficiency of the system when the ph was lowered to 2 this is associated to the fact that at low ph values the concentration of h ions in the aqueous medium tends to increase increasing the competition for active sites with al3 ions and consequently decreasing their removal effectiveness for the biosorbent with blocked carboxylic groups it is possible to notice a significant reduction in the percentage of al3 removal in relation to the percentage obtained in the test performed with res at ph 4 confirming that this group has an important role in the mechanism of al3 removal yet this percentage as well as the removal capacity remains relatively high costa et al 41 achieved similar results for the removal of cr3 ions in their study of blocking functional groups of the same biosorbent applied here these results suggest that the mechanism of removal of trivalent ions can occur mostly by coordination with hydroxyl groups instead of ion exchange with carboxylic functions 22 on the other hand in the process using the residue with blocked sulfate groups removal percentages of around 6 were obtained given the ph of the test a low removal value was already expected but the pronounced reduction in the biosorption efficiency in relation to the test at ph 2 with res reinforces that sulfonic functions have a great involvement in the removal of al3 ions using this material as observed in the results discussed in the previous section 3 1 1 3 4 desorption experiments the results of the eluent selection assays are shown in fig 4 it can be noted that acidic eluents showed better performance in desorption of al3 ions this result is in agreement with what is normally observed in the literature for the elution of other toxic metals such as ag and cu in res 23 24 as for the biosorption of al3 using different algae derived biosorbents e g beach cast seaweed and turbinaria conoides biomass 4 42 as expected the water did not show significant percentages of elution which indicates that the bonds between the metal and the biosorbent are strong and may be mostly chemical in nature 43 vijayaraghavan and yun 44 point out that in order to select the most suitable eluent for the system several factors besides its effectiveness must be evaluated such as the damages caused to the biosorbent as even as to the ecosystem thus table 4 presents the data of mass loss as well as the risks to human health and to the environment for each eluent tested established by the australian government the inventory multi tiered assessment and prioritization imap is a classification of chemicals products based on its hazardous potential in different levels concerning human health risk categories hh i classification indicates substances that are not considered to present an unreasonable danger to human health and the environment in industrial applications hh tier ii represents chemicals industrially applied that have potential to cause some harm and need additional examination while ei classification indicates that the chemical is a reactive substance with rapidly conversion into species of low ecotoxicological concern therefore poses no unreasonable risk to the environment 45 regarding the mass loss the basic eluent cacl2 was the one that most preserved the biosorbent being followed by h2o however at the same time these two eluents also had the two worst elution percentages of al3 na2edta on the other hand presented the highest mass loss of the biosorbent as previously mentioned the acid eluents showed elution percentages greater than 90 concerning mass loss the acidic hno3 solution seems to be less prejudicial to the biosorbent when compared to results obtained for the hcl solution in addition hno3 also presents a lower risk to human health and to the environment according to imap taking all these factors into account nitric acid was the eluting agent selected for the regeneration studies of the biosorbent presented in section 3 5 2 3 5 al3 biosorption in fixed bed column system 3 5 1 effect of flow rate and inlet concentration influence of factors such as bed height flow rate and metal inlet concentration on breakthrough curves have been extensively studied by several researchers kumar et al 46 suggests that between factors frequently studied for dynamic systems flow rate and initial concentration are decisive parameters since it determines respectively the duration of the metal biosorbent contact and the potential driving force for the biosorption process fig 5 shows the breakthrough curves obtained for the fluid dynamic study a and for the analysis of the inlet concentration effect b for the al3 biosorption system using res in continuous mode it can be seen from fig 5a that high flow rates caused a decrease in the breakthrough time this behavior is related to the fact that higher flow rates results in a faster column saturation 23 the flow rate 0 5 ml min is the most suitable for the system since its breakthrough curve has a shape close to a step function indicating that in this flow there is less resistance to mass transfer leading to a smaller mass transfer zone mtz as can be seen in the parameters presented in table 5 regarding parameters such as adsorptive capacities qr and qs and removal percentages rr and rs in general the flow rate of 0 5 ml min also presented superior results compared to the other studied flows hence this feed flow rate was chosen for the subsequent tests this result agrees with most articles related to biosorption in dynamic systems found in the literature moino et al 47 performed the removal of ni2 ions in a continuous system using res and also obtained the best efficiency of the system at the lowest flow rate 0 5 ml min concerning the effect of inlet concentration it can be seen from fig 5b that the breaking point is very close to the concentrations of 1 and 0 8 mmol l while a more pronounced difference can be noted for the 1 5 mmol l curve where the latter reaches the rupture point more quickly than at the other two concentrations studied the minor difference between 1 and 0 8 mmol l breakthrough curves indicates that at lower concentrations the diffusion becomes less influenced by the inlet concentration of the metallic solution however in relation to the shape of the curve it can be noted that 1 mmol l is closer to a step function than the curves of other concentrations assessing the efficiency parameters presented in table 5 for the three concentrations studied it is noted that the mass transfer zone is significantly lower at the inlet concentration of 1 mmol l the mtz calculated in this condition is smaller than values normally observed for toxic metal removal systems using this residue freitas et al 23 obtained mtz of 2 84 cm in optimized conditions for the removal of cu2 ions while nishikawa et al 37 found a minor influence of the concentration variation on the efficiency parameters for cd2 uptake where the obtained mtz values ranged from 2 56 to 2 33 cm both studies using the same column configuration furthermore the 1 0 mmol l concentration also presented better results for the parameters of removal capacity at rupture and for the percentage of removal at rupture and saturation points hence evaluating in general this concentration reaches the objective of optimization of the dynamic system for the removal of al3 ions thus the subsequent assessments were performed under the optimized conditions being c0 1 mmol l and q 0 5 ml min 3 5 2 biosorption desorption cycles after the operational conditions optimization q 0 5 ml min c0 1 0 mmol l four cycles of al3 biosorption using res in a continuous system were performed aiming to evaluate the biosorbent regeneration and reuse potential between each biosorption cycle a desorption cycle was performed using a 0 1 mol l hno3 solution totalizing four desorption cycles fig 6 exhibits the breakthrough curves obtained for the biosorption a and desorption b cycles fig 6a reveals that the biosorbent has satisfactory regeneration potential removing al3 ions up to four cycles satisfactorily this result is interesting to this biosorbent since previous studies indicated that in the removal of other toxic metals the biomass became unviable as of the second cycle of biosorption 15 35 although the rupture time decreased substantially from the first 143 min to the second cycle 46 min it remained considerably stable in the other cycles with 66 and 59 min for the third and fourth respectively from fig 6a it is also observed that the cycles with the exception of the first are similar in relation to their profile however the efficiency parameters must be analyzed to evaluate them individually as well as the viability of each one table 6 presents the parameters obtained for the breakthrough curves of the regeneration cycles it is possible to note that the second cycle showed an inferior performance among all this may be linked to the fact that the al3 ions were not fully eluted in the first desorption cycle the decrease in the removal capacity was already expected since the use of an acid eluting solution leads to an increase in the binding of h ions in the active sites on the surface of the biosorbent thus sites are gradually more occupied with each elution leading to the lower availability for binding with al3 ions in the next biosorption cycle this effect was minimized by carrying out between the desorption and biosorption cycles a step of washing the bed with deionized water passing constantly for 1 h in order to remove the h ions in excess present in the biosorbent 48 50 however the tendency is that at some point the effect of protonation of the active sites may be too strong to be reversed thus collaborating to achieve the exhaustion of the biosorbent material the pattern observed for mtz is also similar to that obtained for removal capabilities at first the mtz value is low and satisfactory showing viability of the column but in the second cycle the value of this parameter increases considerably decreases in the next cycle and increases slightly in the last cycle this behavior converges to the fact that the first cycle of desorption was not as efficient as the successors however at the same time the increment of this parameter was expected since it has a directly relation to the increase in mass transfer resistance as previously mentioned results obtained in this study are a novelty for the metal removal in fixed bed system using this residue several previous studies have evaluated that after the second biosorption cycle the system suffers a significant loss of efficiency not being viable to continuation it is possible to associate this superior regeneration potential of the system presented in this research to the evaluated metal since in general other studies evaluating the removal of al3 using different biosorbents showed good performance in multiple reuse cycles for example boeris et al 51 performed the biosorption of al3 in fixed bed using pseudomonas putida immobilized on agar agar and reached up to 12 removal cycles keeping the capacity and the percentage of removal almost constant amidst them in addition to these other studies evaluated the use of regenerated biosorbents al3 removal in batch mode obtaining promising results by performing several cycles without major losses in the efficiency of the system 6 9 10 this may be associated with the properties of the bonds that al3 forms with the functional groups of the biomaterial in this case they may be weaker perhaps most of a physical nature and thus easier to break facilitating the regeneration of the biosorbent 3 5 3 biosorption modeling studies on the biosorption of al3 ions in fixed bed columns are not abundant in the literature although this is a topic of great interest since this is the configuration that most closely matches the process scale up aiming the industrial application that said the application of mathematical and phenomenological models helps to predict the breakthrough curves and the systems maximum capacity fig 2s see supplementary material presents the mathematical modeling of curves obtained for the feed flow rate and inlet concentration studies applying yoon nelson yan et al thomas clark and dualsd models adjustment parameters are shown in table 7 in general all models presented r² greater than 0 95 for all breakthrough curves fit indicating a good adherence to data however the model that seems to best describe the system behavior was the phenomenological model dualsd which presented all r² values above 0 99 lower values for the akaike criterion aicc and qe pred values very close to the qs experimental values the best fit of this model indicates that two diffusion rates influence the rupture curves at different times in the biosorption process 29 regarding mathematical models yan et al model also showed considerable fitting to the experimental values obtained this model was developed aiming to reduce errors in the adjustment of the thomas model which in fact can be seen in table 7 where the adsorptive capacity values predicted by yan are closer to the experimental values this indicates that the parameters obtained from yan et al model could be used for the scale up of al3 ions biosorption system using res in the literature it is possible to observe that yan et al often tends to fit better to experimental data from biosorption systems using res for the uptake of toxic metals 15 35 37 except for the breakthrough curve in the optimized conditions q 0 5 ml min and c0 1 mmol l in general no mathematical model was able to predict assertive adsorptive capacity values with the experimental data this is related to the fact that none of these models appears to predict satisfactorily the curves final data nonetheless due to the good fit of the models the parameters obtained by them can also be considered for the analysis of the system apart from the curve for the highest concentration 1 5 mmol l it can be noted that some parameters of the yoon nelson and thomas model are equal as well as the values of r² and aicc this is due to the mathematical equivalence between both models whatever has been commonly reported in other studies 29 52 analyzing the τ parameter of the yoon nelson model which is related to the time to reach 50 of the saturation of the biosorbent the values decreased in higher flows and concentrations since a higher flow leads to a greater amount of solution to be treated inducing a faster saturation of the adsorbent material that also occurs at higher concentrations in clark model parameter a improved with decreasing flow and reduced with increasing initial concentration although this parameter has no physical significance 53 this behavior indicates that the removal of al3 ions by res in fixed bed is favored by lower flows and concentrations fig 3s see supplementary material and table 8 present respectively the rupture curves and adjustment parameters obtained for the performed biosorption cycles it is possible to verify from table 8 that the adsorption capacity values predicted by all models decreased over the cycles following the behavior of the experimental data this result is expected since the tendency of the biosorbent to lose its effectiveness was already observed in the breakthrough parameters previously discussed in section 3 5 2 it can be also observed that models constants follow a general tendency to increase from the first to the last cycle regarding models adjustment results similar to those observed in the evaluation of the flow and initial concentration were obtained the dualsd model presented better fitting with r² closer to a unity and lower aicc values in this case among the mathematical models yan et al also seems to describe the data of the cycle s breakthrough curves where the adsorption capacities values predicted by the model are closer to those obtained experimentally 4 conclusions in this work the ion exchange involved in the al3 biosorption process using residue derived from the brown alga s filipendula was evaluated batch mode tests alongside with sem edx analysis showed that ion exchange mechanisms are involved in the removal of al3 by res among the light metals ions analyzed na k mg2 and ca2 na ions have major participation in the exchange of al3 whereas mg2 and k ions present minor roles ftir analysis and blocking assays indicated that carboxylic amino and sulfonate functional groups play a key role on the al3 biosorption hno3 solution presented the best result for the recovery of the contaminated residue and caused fewer damages on the biosorbent in fixed bed system the most suitable condition was the flow rate of 0 5 ml min and initial al3 concentration of 1 mmol l biosorbent regenerating and reusing studies showed that the removal capacity remained satisfactory in the four performed cycles the modeling indicated that the phenomenological model dualsd best described the breakthrough data in summary the residue seems to be a promising alternative biosorbent for the removal of al3 ions in a dynamic system future studies on larger scales aiming at industrial application should be performed since this biosorbent presents besides to the good adsorption capacity several advantages such as low cost high

13437,this study aimed to evaluate the ion exchange and biosorption of al3 using as biosorbent material residual biomass generated in the alginate extraction process from the brown algae s filipendula named res the batch mode results showed that ion exchange mainly with na ions has important participation in the removal of al3 ions by res characterization analyses and blocking assays indicated that carboxylic amino and sulfonate functional groups play a key role on the al3 biosorption the dynamic system in a fixed packed bed column and the reuse regeneration of the biosorbent was assessed by

cycles demonstrated the reuse feasibility of the biosorbent which maintained a considerable adsorption capacity in all cycles performed keywords biosorption aluminum residue brown algae fixed bed 1 introduction in view of the current scenario of constant industrial expansion and consequently the increase in the pollution of water bodies by the discharge of contaminated effluents processes for the removal of pollutants have been increasingly investigated among the processes most used nowadays by the industry for the treatment of contaminated wastewaters generally chemical precipitation is the most applied mainly due to its operational simplicity nevertheless this method generates large amounts of highly contaminated sludge thus leading to the occurrence of secondary pollution therefore advanced methods with redefined approaches are necessary in search for a sustainable development of industrial expansion biosorption is an adsorption process that uses materials of biological origin as adsorbents biosorbents to remove various types of contaminants especially toxic metals 1 2 this technology stands out for being simple eco friendly inexpensive and at the same time flexible for scale up that is for the continuous treatment of large amounts of effluents contaminated with mild concentrations of metals aluminum is a hazardous metal widely used in several industrial processes e g mining metallurgic smelting and electroplating hence large amounts of wastewaters are found with significant concentrations of this metal 3 4 once they are generated quickly and in large quantities the treatment of these effluents requires a fast cheap and simple method such as biosorption and in this case the properties of the biosorbent material must also meet requirements such as having high availability and the lowest commercial value as possible there are several studies reported in the literature that uses different biomaterials for the removal of al3 such as microorganisms agro industrial residues and seaweeds 5 10 algae are known as promisors biosorbents for the removal of toxic metals due to their great affinity 11 especially brown algae stands out for having satisfactory al3 removal percentages when compared to green and red algae 9 the system studied in this research consists on the biosorption of al3 ions in an aqueous medium using as biosorbent the residue from the alginate extraction from the brown alga sargassum filipendula this biomaterial in addition to meeting the requirements previously mentioned is also considered promising for the uptake of toxic metals for having in its composition functional groups directly associated to the mechanism of toxic metals removal 12 previously studies highlighted the effectiveness of this biosorbent for removing metals such as cadmium zinc chromium and nickel 13 15 since it has no added value this waste here termed as res is usually discarded in the sea compared to other toxic metals a lack in literature for in depth investigations on al3 biosorption systems is found 16 in addition to that in previous works this residue biosorbent showed a remarkable affinity for al3 ions however this system had not yet completely studied 17 thus this metal was selected for this study this work has the objective to advance in understanding the mechanism of ion exchange involved in the biosorption of al3 using the residue through batch studies and characterizations of the biosorbent material before and after the process furthermore the viability efficiency of the process and the biosorbent regeneration in continuous system was also investigated all objectives meet at the point of explore an innovative accessible and feasible technology to remove al3 ions present in aqueous media in addition to helping to fill the niche found in the literature concerning al3 biosorption studies in a fixed bed dynamic system 2 material and methods 2 1 aluminum solution al3 solutions were prepared using analytical nonahydrate al3 nitrate al no3 3 9h2o dinâmica dissolved in deionized water at required concentrations and molar proportions 2 2 biosorbent obtainment the raw biomass of s filipendula was gathered at cigarra s beach on the north coast of são paulo brazil the seaweed was rinsed with deionized water repetitively and dried at 333 15 k for 24 h and refined at particles with diameter around 1 mm alginate removal was performed according to mchugh s methodology 18 the dealginated residue here termed as res generated from extraction operation was washed and dried 333 15 k 24 h in order to obtain fractions with diameter about 0 737 mm the biosorbent was sieved through 12 16 and 32 mesh screens 2 3 biosorbent characterization characterization analyses were carried out on the residue before res and after res al biosorption in order to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the al3 uptake using this biomaterial to analyze the morphology and chemical composition of the biosorbent scanning electron microscopy with x ray dispersive energy sem edx leo 440i 6070 england was conducted the biosorbent was overlaid with a gold film 200 a before scanning the micrographs were obtained with 1000x magnification and the operating conditions were 50 pa and 15 kv for sem and 800 pa and 20 kv for edx analysis fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was conducted to obtain information about the functional groups present on the surface of the biosorbent the analysis was performed in a spectrum range of 4000 to 500 cm 1 with scan resolution of 4 cm 1 using a nicolet 6700 spectrometer thermoscientific 2 4 ion exchange study the occurrence of ion exchange mechanisms is a characteristic of seaweed biomasses and are frequently involved on toxic metal removal 19 in view of the possible participation of these mechanisms in al3 biosorption the occurrence of this phenomenon was evaluated in kinetic studies that were conducted in order to determine the concentration profiles of the main light cations ca2 k mg2 and na involved in the removal of toxic metals using this biosorbent 13 for this purpose 1000 ml of a 3 mmol l al3 solution was treated with 2 g of residue at room temperature 298 15 k for 3 h under constant agitation 250 rpm aiming to avoid metal precipitation the solution ph was fixed at 4 and controlled using hno3 solutions 0 1 and 0 5 mmol l samples were collected at regular time intervals and the metal concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry aas shimadzu japan 2 5 esterification of functional groups to evaluate the participation of the main functional groups in the removal of al3 ions by the residue the esterification of these groups was performed the blocked functional groups were the carboxyl and sulfonate groups as they are notably the most involved in biosorption processes using algae derived biomasses 11 the esterification of the carboxylic groups was performed according to the methodology established by gardea torresdey et al 20 where 4 g of residue were added to a solution of 260 ml of methanol and 2 4 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid in constant agitation for 6 h at 298 15 k subsequently the biosorbent was rinsed with deionized water and dried at 333 15 k for 12 h this residue was named esterified waste res est for the esterification of sulfonate groups 1 g of the residue was put in contact to a mixture of 50 ml of methanol and 0 5 ml of hydrochloric acid under constant stirring for 48 h divided into 4 cycles where the methanol and hcl solution was replaced between cycles the residue termed blocked esterified residue res est blk was washed with deionized water and dried for 12 h at 333 15 k 21 blocking experiments were conducted in batch mode in an orbital shaker jeiotech si 600r with constant agitation 250 rpm and controlled temperature 298 15 k for 6 h the dosage of biosorbent was 2 g l for both biomasses in order to respect the acid constant pka of each group the tests were conducted at different ph for res est and res est blk according to sheng et al 22 brown algae carboxylic groups have pka in range of 3 5 5 whereas for sulfonate groups this value is between 1 and 2 5 so tests with the esterified residue were performed at ph 5 while for the esterified and blocked residue ph 2 was chosen to evaluate the adsorptive capacity of the residues in equilibrium qeq mmol g and the

flow of deionized water for 1 h fixed bed parameters i e qr qs ztm rr and rs were calculated aiming to compare with results previously obtained 2 7 3 model evaluation mathematical modeling is used to describe the behavior of breakthrough curves assisting in the understanding and scale up of the system five different column adsorption models were adjusted to breakthrough curves data to explain the process of al3 biosorption by res in fixed bed configuration as follows yoon nelson 25 thomas 26 clark 27 yan et al 28 and dualsd 29 the mathematical models of yoon nelson thomas clark and yan et al are well established in the literature and the most commonly found to predict the dynamic behavior of biosorption systems while the dualsd model is more recent and based on the law of mass conservation 29 the yoon nelson model undertakes that the adsorption rate decreases proportionally to the removal of adsorbate and the rupture curve of the adsorbent disregarding information such as adsorbate properties type of adsorbent and specifications about the adsorption column thomas mathematical model presumes that intraparticle diffusion and external resistance to mass transfer are low therefore negligible and that the adsorption process is governed by the reversible kinetic model of pseudo second order with equilibrium described by the langmuir model while clark s model is based on the concepts of mass transfer and the freundlich isotherm in addition to assuming that the flow of the solution in the column behaves like a piston and discards the occurrence of dispersion 30 the empirical model proposed by yan et al minimizes possible errors in the application of the thomas model the dualsd model is based on linear driving force models and assumes that the biosorbent surface is formed by different types of adsorption sites therefore different kinetics behaviors can govern the process the equations for each model are listed in table 1 models adjustment to the experimental data were performed using maple 17 and origin 8 2 7 4 error analysis models adjustments were analyzed using the determination coefficients r² eq 9 and the corrected akaike information criteria aicc eq

characterization 3 1 1 ftir the understanding of functional groups involved in the biosorption of toxic metals is essential to elucidate the mechanism of this process groups such as carboxylic sulfonate hydroxyl and amine are among the major responsible for the metal uptake by algae biomaterials 31 in the case of the residue studied here its composition is very similar to the sargassum filipendula seaweed 12 in order to analyze the functional groups involved in the removal of al3 ions by res fig 1 shows the infrared spectrum of the unloaded a and al loaded b residue according to sheng et al 22 the broadband at 3000 3600 cm 1 corresponds to bindings related to the oh and nh groups the change observed in the peak of 3420 cm 1 of res to 3440 cm 1 in res al indicates that these groups have an active participation in the bonding with al3 ions the variation of bands from 1538 cm 1 to 1548 cm 1 after biosorption confirms the amino groups participation in the process the peaks identified in the region of 1639 cm 1 and 1404 cm 1 represent the coo m carboxylic salts where m refers to light metals as na k mg2 and ca2 21 the change to 1643 and 1462 cm 1 suggests that these metals are being exchanged for the metal of interest in this case al3 pointing to the occurrence of ion exchange mechanisms this result is confirmed by the ion exchange evaluation experiment discussed further in section 3 2 the peaks at 1057 and 1031 cm 1 are ascribed to co bonds of the alcoholic groups after the removal of al3 these values changed to 1059 and 1029 cm 1 respectively this subtle shift may reveal that coordination with the metal ions has minor participation in the mechanism of al3 uptake by res the band at 1111 01 cm 1 is related to the stretching of co of ether groups the variation to 1115 10 cm 1 after biosorption indicates that these bindings also have trivial participation in this system the band at 1164 cm 1 res and 1172 cm 1 res al is associated with sulfonic groups so and cso of fucoidan one of the main compounds of the brown alga s filipendula 32 the changes in peaks at 1256 cm 1 in res to 1233 cm 1 in res al are also linked to sulfonic functions the significant changes noted in these bands after the biosorption process point that sulfonic groups actively take part in the al3 complexation by res thus it can be inferred that carboxylic amino and sulfates groups are predominantly participating in the process of al3 removal using the residue the sharp peaks at 820 cm 1 res and 829 cm 1 res al are related to the participation of mannuronic groups which indicates the presence of remaining alginate from the extraction process 33 overall similar results are reported in the literature for res in the uptake of other toxic metals as for other biosorbents algae derived in the removal of al3 ions 1 9 10 34 35 3 1 2 sem edx fig 2 depicts the micrographs obtained for the residue before a and after b the biosorption of al3 in addition to showing the distribution of this metal on the surface of the biosorbent c moreover table 2 summarizes the chemical composition obtained by edx also for raw and al contaminated res from fig 2 a and b it can be noted that the biosorbent before and after biosorption has a very irregular rough surface with macropores and cracks many of these irregularities can be associated with damages caused by the process of alginate extraction since it is present in large percentage on the algal cell wall the presence of whitish spots pointed by the black arrows is associated with the phenomenon called calcium flowers covering the surface of the biomaterial that are remaining after removal of al confirming what can be seen in table 2 where the percentage of calcium in the residue decreases after biosorption but does not reach zero furthermore it is also possible to notice the presence of diatom shells indicated by black circles in the images these organisms are commonly found in seaweed and contain elements such as al s and mainly si the latter being responsible for the rigidity of the wall cell 36 thus it may justify the presence of these elements in the residue composition presented in table 2 in fig 2 c it is possible to visualize that the al3 ions are apparently distributed homogeneously on the surface of the biosorbent a result similar to that reported in other studies 37 38 analyzing table 2 it is possible to verify that in addition to c and o the element with the greatest presence in the composition of pure waste is sodium na the notable decrease in its percentage after the al3 biosorption process indicates the involvement of a mechanism ion exchange in removing the metal of interest in contrast to this behavior after biosorption an increase in the percentage of al3 is noted as expected indicating the possible participation of ion exchange mechanisms in al3 uptake by res ion exchange is usually identified as the main mechanism for the biosorption of metals in biosorbents derived from brown algae 11 in addition to that it is observed that despite the remarkable percentage of s and si these two elements appear to have little participation in the ion exchange mechanism the opposite is observed for mg2 and ca2 where after biosorption the presence of these elements was reduced substantially to almost zero similar results were obtained by freitas et al 38 and costa et al 12 analyzing the biosorption of other toxic metals by this same biomaterial other paper works also report the presence of other elements such as fe p and k that were not found by edx analysis in this study however bertagnolli et al 34 highlight that the composition of the alga is affected by factors such as the season of the year in which it was collected or the stage of its life cycle 3 2 investigation of ion exchange mechanism considering the results obtained by analyzing the chemical composition of the biosorbent experiments were carried out to evaluate the ion exchange between al3 and light metals such as na mg2 k and ca2 in the biosorption process using res the investigated metals were selected based on previously reports in the literature fig 3 shows the kinetic profile of ion exchange behavior obtained using a solution with an initial al3 concentration of 3 mmol l fig 3 makes explicit the exchange behavior between al3 ions and light metals linked to the functional groups on the biosorbent surface it can be observed that na ions concentration remarkable increases in the medium while al3 ions concentration decreases rapidly indicating that na ions were exchanged for al3 ions in the active sites on the biosorbent surface hence na stands out as the main exchangeable metal in the system followed by mg2 and ca2 this pattern is in accordance with that observed in table 2 of the previous section 3 1 2 although k was not presented in the quantification by edx it also seems to have such a small participation in the system s ion exchange mechanism the major exchange between na and al3 ions is also commonly observed in the biosorption of other metals by algae derived biosorbents 32 38 39 also the hard soft acid base hsba principle helps to clarify the connection between metals according to this theory metals like al3 na ca2 k and mg2 are classified as hard acids 40 according to gadd 40 hard cations exhibit greater electronegativity and low polarization and therefore tend to participate in electrostatic bonds with ligands of functional groups still following this theory al3 would form more stable complexes with hard binders that is oxygen containing ligands such as oh and co3 2 3 3 effect of functional groups esterification given the confirmation in the preceding section 3 1 1 of the broad participation of carboxylic and sulfonate groups in al3 biosorption using res and aiming to evaluate the influence of each one in the bonding of the metal in the biosorbent surface assays were carried out using res with these groups esterified table 3 presents the results obtained for the tests using the residue without modifications res at ph 4 and 2 for esterified residue res est at ph 4 and for esterified and blocked residue res est blk at ph 2 as aforementioned the ph values of the experiments were chosen based on the pka ph where the group has more active participation in the removal of metals of each blocked functional group it is well established in the literature that there is a great influence of ph in the adsorptive capacity and in the percentage of removal in biosorption processes this is confirmed by observing the results obtained for biosorption at ph 4 and ph 2 using the residue without modifications it is noted that there was a significant drop in the efficiency of the system when the ph was lowered to 2 this is associated to the fact that at low ph values the concentration of h ions in the aqueous medium tends to increase increasing the competition for active sites with al3 ions and consequently decreasing their removal effectiveness for the biosorbent with blocked carboxylic groups it is possible to notice a significant reduction in the percentage of al3 removal in relation to the percentage obtained in the test performed with res at ph 4 confirming that this group has an important role in the mechanism of al3 removal yet this percentage as well as the removal capacity remains relatively high costa et al 41 achieved similar results for the removal of cr3 ions in their study of blocking functional groups of the same biosorbent applied here these results suggest that the mechanism of removal of trivalent ions can occur mostly by coordination with hydroxyl groups instead of ion exchange with carboxylic functions 22 on the other hand in the process using the residue with blocked sulfate groups removal percentages of around 6 were obtained given the ph of the test a low removal value was already expected but the pronounced reduction in the biosorption efficiency in relation to the test at ph 2 with res reinforces that sulfonic functions have a great involvement in the removal of al3 ions using this material as observed in the results discussed in the previous section 3 1 1 3 4 desorption experiments the results of the eluent selection assays are shown in fig 4 it can be noted that acidic eluents showed better performance in desorption of al3 ions this result is in agreement with what is normally observed in the literature for the elution of other toxic metals such as ag and cu in res 23 24 as for the biosorption of al3 using different algae derived biosorbents e g beach cast seaweed and turbinaria conoides biomass 4 42 as expected the water did not show significant percentages of elution which indicates that the bonds between the metal and the biosorbent are strong and may be mostly chemical in nature 43 vijayaraghavan and yun 44 point out that in order to select the most suitable eluent for the system several factors besides its effectiveness must be evaluated such as the damages caused to the biosorbent as even as to the ecosystem thus table 4 presents the data of mass loss as well as the risks to human health and to the environment for each eluent tested established by the australian government the inventory multi tiered assessment and prioritization imap is a classification of chemicals products based on its hazardous potential in different levels concerning human health risk categories hh i classification indicates substances that are not considered to present an unreasonable danger to human health and the environment in industrial applications hh tier ii represents chemicals industrially applied that have potential to cause some harm and need additional examination while ei classification indicates that the chemical is a reactive substance with rapidly conversion into species of low ecotoxicological concern therefore poses no unreasonable risk to the environment 45 regarding the mass loss the basic eluent cacl2 was the one that most preserved the biosorbent being followed by h2o however at the same time these two eluents also had the two worst elution percentages of al3 na2edta on the other hand presented the highest mass loss of the biosorbent as previously mentioned the acid eluents showed elution percentages greater than 90 concerning mass loss the acidic hno3 solution seems to be less prejudicial to the biosorbent when compared to results obtained for the hcl solution in addition hno3 also presents a lower risk to human health and to the environment according to imap taking all these factors into account nitric acid was the eluting agent selected for the regeneration studies of the biosorbent presented in section 3 5 2 3 5 al3 biosorption in fixed bed column system 3 5 1 effect of flow rate and inlet concentration influence of factors such as bed height flow rate and metal inlet concentration on breakthrough curves have been extensively studied by several researchers kumar et al 46 suggests that between factors frequently studied for dynamic systems flow rate and initial concentration are decisive parameters since it determines respectively the duration of the metal biosorbent contact and the potential driving force for the biosorption process fig 5 shows the breakthrough curves obtained for the fluid dynamic study a and for the analysis of the inlet concentration effect b for the al3 biosorption system using res in continuous mode it can be seen from fig 5a that high flow rates caused a decrease in the breakthrough time this behavior is related to the fact that higher flow rates results in a faster column saturation 23 the flow rate 0 5 ml min is the most suitable for the system since its breakthrough curve has a shape close to a step function indicating that in this flow there is less resistance to mass transfer leading to a smaller mass transfer zone mtz as can be seen in the parameters presented in table 5 regarding parameters such as adsorptive capacities qr and qs and removal percentages rr and rs in general the flow rate of 0 5 ml min also presented superior results compared to the other studied flows hence this feed flow rate was chosen for the subsequent tests this result agrees with most articles related to biosorption in dynamic systems found in the literature moino et al 47 performed the removal of ni2 ions in a continuous system using res and also obtained the best efficiency of the system at the lowest flow rate 0 5 ml min concerning the effect of inlet concentration it can be seen from fig 5b that the breaking point is very close to the concentrations of 1 and 0 8 mmol l while a more pronounced difference can be noted for the 1 5 mmol l curve where the latter reaches the rupture point more quickly than at the other two concentrations studied the minor difference between 1 and 0 8 mmol l breakthrough curves indicates that at lower concentrations the diffusion becomes less influenced by the inlet concentration of the metallic solution however in relation to the shape of the curve it can be noted that 1 mmol l is closer to a step function than the curves of other concentrations assessing the efficiency parameters presented in table 5 for the three concentrations studied it is noted that the mass transfer zone is significantly lower at the inlet concentration of 1 mmol l the mtz calculated in this condition is smaller than values normally observed for toxic metal removal systems using this residue freitas et al 23 obtained mtz of 2 84 cm in optimized conditions for the removal of cu2 ions while nishikawa et al 37 found a minor influence of the concentration variation on the efficiency parameters for cd2 uptake where the obtained mtz values ranged from 2 56 to 2 33 cm both studies using the same column configuration furthermore the 1 0 mmol l concentration also presented better results for the parameters of removal capacity at rupture and for the percentage of removal at rupture and saturation points hence evaluating in general this concentration reaches the objective of optimization of the dynamic system for the removal of al3 ions thus the subsequent assessments were performed under the optimized conditions being c0 1 mmol l and q 0 5 ml min 3 5 2 biosorption desorption cycles after the operational conditions optimization q 0 5 ml min c0 1 0 mmol l four cycles of al3 biosorption using res in a continuous system were performed aiming to evaluate the biosorbent regeneration and reuse potential between each biosorption cycle a desorption cycle was performed using a 0 1 mol l hno3 solution totalizing four desorption cycles fig 6 exhibits the breakthrough curves obtained for the biosorption a and desorption b cycles fig 6a reveals that the biosorbent has satisfactory regeneration potential removing al3 ions up to four cycles satisfactorily this result is interesting to this biosorbent since previous studies indicated that in the removal of other toxic metals the biomass became unviable as of the second cycle of biosorption 15 35 although the rupture time decreased substantially from the first 143 min to the second cycle 46 min it remained considerably stable in the other cycles with 66 and 59 min for the third and fourth respectively from fig 6a it is also observed that the cycles with the exception of the first are similar in relation to their profile however the efficiency parameters must be analyzed to evaluate them individually as well as the viability of each one table 6 presents the parameters obtained for the breakthrough curves of the regeneration cycles it is possible to note that the second cycle showed an inferior performance among all this may be linked to the fact that the al3 ions were not fully eluted in the first desorption cycle the decrease in the removal capacity was already expected since the use of an acid eluting solution leads to an increase in the binding of h ions in the active sites on the surface of the biosorbent thus sites are gradually more occupied with each elution leading to the lower availability for binding with al3 ions in the next biosorption cycle this effect was minimized by carrying out between the desorption and biosorption cycles a step of washing the bed with deionized water passing constantly for 1 h in order to remove the h ions in excess present in the biosorbent 48 50 however the tendency is that at some point the effect of protonation of the active sites may be too strong to be reversed thus collaborating to achieve the exhaustion of the biosorbent material the pattern observed for mtz is also similar to that obtained for removal capabilities at first the mtz value is low and satisfactory showing viability of the column but in the second cycle the value of this parameter increases considerably decreases in the next cycle and increases slightly in the last cycle this behavior converges to the fact that the first cycle of desorption was not as efficient as the successors however at the same time the increment of this parameter was expected since it has a directly relation to the increase in mass transfer resistance as previously mentioned results obtained in this study are a novelty for the metal removal in fixed bed system using this residue several previous studies have evaluated that after the second biosorption cycle the system suffers a significant loss of efficiency not being viable to continuation it is possible to associate this superior regeneration potential of the system presented in this research to the evaluated metal since in general other studies evaluating the removal of al3 using different biosorbents showed good performance in multiple reuse cycles for example boeris et al 51 performed the biosorption of al3 in fixed bed using pseudomonas putida immobilized on agar agar and reached up to 12 removal cycles keeping the capacity and the percentage of removal almost constant amidst them in addition to these other studies evaluated the use of regenerated biosorbents al3 removal in batch mode obtaining promising results by performing several cycles without major losses in the efficiency of the system 6 9 10 this may be associated with the properties of the bonds that al3 forms with the functional groups of the biomaterial in this case they may be weaker perhaps most of a physical nature and thus easier to break facilitating the regeneration of the biosorbent 3 5 3 biosorption modeling studies on the biosorption of al3 ions in fixed bed columns are not abundant in the literature although this is a topic of great interest since this is the configuration that most closely matches the process scale up aiming the industrial application that said the application of mathematical and phenomenological models helps to predict the breakthrough curves and the systems maximum capacity fig 2s see supplementary material presents the mathematical modeling of curves obtained for the feed flow rate and inlet concentration studies applying yoon nelson yan et al thomas clark and dualsd models adjustment parameters are shown in table 7 in general all models presented r² greater than 0 95 for all breakthrough curves fit indicating a good adherence to data however the model that seems to best describe the system behavior was the phenomenological model dualsd which presented all r² values above 0 99 lower values for the akaike criterion aicc and qe pred values very close to the qs experimental values the best fit of this model indicates that two diffusion rates influence the rupture curves at different times in the biosorption process 29 regarding mathematical models yan et al model also showed considerable fitting to the experimental values obtained this model was developed aiming to reduce errors in the adjustment of the thomas model which in fact can be seen in table 7 where the adsorptive capacity values predicted by yan are closer to the experimental values this indicates that the parameters obtained from yan et al model could be used for the scale up of al3 ions biosorption system using res in the literature it is possible to observe that yan et al often tends to fit better to experimental data from biosorption systems using res for the uptake of toxic metals 15 35 37 except for the breakthrough curve in the optimized conditions q 0 5 ml min and c0 1 mmol l in general no mathematical model was able to predict assertive adsorptive capacity values with the experimental data this is related to the fact that none of these models appears to predict satisfactorily the curves final data nonetheless due to the good fit of the models the parameters obtained by them can also be considered for the analysis of the system apart from the curve for the highest concentration 1 5 mmol l it can be noted that some parameters of the yoon nelson and thomas model are equal as well as the values of r² and aicc this is due to the mathematical equivalence between both models whatever has been commonly reported in other studies 29 52 analyzing the τ parameter of the yoon nelson model which is related to the time to reach 50 of the saturation of the biosorbent the values decreased in higher flows and concentrations since a higher flow leads to a greater amount of solution to be treated inducing a faster saturation of the adsorbent material that also occurs at higher concentrations in clark model parameter a improved with decreasing flow and reduced with increasing initial concentration although this parameter has no physical significance 53 this behavior indicates that the removal of al3 ions by res in fixed bed is favored by lower flows and concentrations fig 3s see supplementary material and table 8 present respectively the rupture curves and adjustment parameters obtained for the performed biosorption cycles it is possible to verify from table 8 that the adsorption capacity values predicted by all models decreased over the cycles following the behavior of the experimental data this result is expected since the tendency of the biosorbent to lose its effectiveness was already observed in the breakthrough parameters previously discussed in section 3 5 2 it can be also observed that models constants follow a general tendency to increase from the first to the last cycle regarding models adjustment results similar to those observed in the evaluation of the flow and initial concentration were obtained the dualsd model presented better fitting with r² closer to a unity and lower aicc values in this case among the mathematical models yan et al also seems to describe the data of the cycle s breakthrough curves where the adsorption capacities values predicted by the model are closer to those obtained experimentally 4 conclusions in this work the ion exchange involved in the al3 biosorption process using residue derived from the brown alga s filipendula was evaluated batch mode tests alongside with sem edx analysis showed that ion exchange mechanisms are involved in the removal of al3 by res among the light metals ions analyzed na k mg2 and ca2 na ions have major participation in the exchange of al3 whereas mg2 and k ions present minor roles ftir analysis and blocking assays indicated that carboxylic amino and sulfonate functional groups play a key role on the al3 biosorption hno3 solution presented the best result for the recovery of the contaminated residue and caused fewer damages on the biosorbent in fixed bed system the most suitable condition was the flow rate of 0 5 ml min and initial al3 concentration of 1 mmol l biosorbent regenerating and reusing studies showed that the removal capacity remained satisfactory in the four performed cycles the modeling indicated that the phenomenological model dualsd best described the breakthrough data in summary the residue seems to be a promising alternative biosorbent for the removal of al3 ions in a dynamic system future studies on larger scales aiming at industrial application should be performed since this biosorbent presents besides to the good adsorption capacity several advantages such as low cost high

13438,a novel chacf juc 505 system through the introduction of h2 and pd juc 505 into the classic fenton system under normal temperature and pressure was developed in this work through the experiment of quenching hydroxyl radical oh by methanol the analysis of degradation intermediates and total organic carbon it was confirmed from the reverse that the target pollutant sulfamethazine smt could be quickly adsorbed by juc 505 the activated hydrogen generated from the adsorbed and activated h2 by pd juc 505 accelerated the reduction of feiii it was confirmed that the continuous production of oh required only a trace amount of iron by the detection of para hydroxybenzoic acid the removal of smt was further enhanced by the degradation of oh the cleavage of sn bond was considered to be the major degradation pathway of smt the concentration of feii in the chacf juc 505 system could be at least 14 72 μm and the removal efficiency of smt was about 96 77 that was 3 and 4 6 times that of the fenton system in the same reaction condition respectively the effects of the dosage of ferrous ion h2o2 and pd juc 505 initial concentration of smt and ph and the flow of h2 were investigated the robustness and morphological changes in pd juc 505 were also systematically analyzed keywords hydrogen feiii reduction fenton reaction adsorption pd juc 505 1 introduction sulfamethazine smt depicted in fig 1 is a stable antibiotic in aqueous environment it is widely used in the prevention and treatment of poultry diseases due to its broad spectrum antibacterial properties 1 5 however this property makes it ineffectively to be removed by using conventional treatment processes 6 10 once it flows into the natural water environment not only does it inhibit and kill microorganisms but also it causes potential antibiotic resistance and carcinogenic risks after entering the human body through the food chain 11 19 therefore it is paramount to research and develop a novel process that could efficiently remove smt compared with other similar technologies fenton process is the most widely used in the degradation of refractory organics under normal temperature and pressure due to its easy operation and high degradation efficiency 20 25 however the consumption rate of feii which is oxidized to feiii is 1 3 magnitude faster than the regeneration rate of feii which is reduced by feiii during the reaction process 26 therefore the ferrous salt and hydrogen peroxide must be used continuously to maintain the generation of hydroxyl radical oh in this acidic system large amounts of iron sludge composed of the oxyhydroxides of feii and feiii are generated during the reaction process due to the adjustment of effluent ph back to 6 9 to satisfy the emission regulatory standard the iron sludge could not be reduced by incineration and landfilling them will occupy a great deal of land resources 27 28 that leads to a significant disadvantage when it comes to the application of the fenton reaction in modern society 29 the key to decreasing the production of iron sludge is to reduce the dosage of ferrous salt accelerating the reduction of feiii back to feii is a promising way to solve this problem in previous studies the energy input from light 30 32 electricity 33 35 and ultrasound 36 37 has been proven to accelerate the reduction of feiii yet the operation is complicated and the energy efficiency needs to be further improved some organics could be used to accelerate the reduction of feiii through chemical reduction 38 40 construction of redox mediators 41 43 and improvement in the efficiency of electron transfer 44 45 however it is almost impossible to accurately control the dosage in practice excessive dosing may lead to potential secondary organic pollution in effluent inorganics such as transition metal sulfides 46 48 oxides 49 and simple substances 50 could also achieve this goal by chemical reduction and the improvement of the efficiency of electron transfer with special structures 51 52 while these technologies yield effective outcomes the potential secondary pollution risks such as the elution of heavy metals and the release of hydrogen sulfide must be carefully evaluated in future applications beside these inorganic reductants feiii could also be reduced by hydrogen the product of the reduction reaction of hydrogen is water 53 however the reduction efficiency is low due to the insoluble of hydrogen under normal temperature the vast majority of h2 will immediately return to gaseous phase after being supplied into the aqueous solution an accelerated catalytic fenton system was constructed by introducing h2 and pd0 into the fenton system the palladium was used to promote the adsorption and activation of h2 the methyl tert butyl ether could be rapidly degraded by it however during the whole process the partial pressure of h2 should be maintained at 0 1 mpa it could be reduced by increasing the dosage of pd0 though it is significantly not economical for application in recent years the emergence of porous crystalline materials with high specific surface area and surface modification has broadened the choice of hydrogen storage materials 54 55 in our previous works an improved h2 accelerated catalytic fenton reaction system named mhacf metallic organic frameworks mofs h2 accelerated catalytic fenton was constructed by introducing pd mofs material such as mil 101 cr and nh2 mil 101 cr and hydrogen into the fenton reaction the mofs materials enhanced the regeneration of feii by accelerating the adsorption and activation of h2 with only trace amount of ferrous the organic pollutant could be continuously degraded however the degradation efficiency decreased continuously due to the gradual damage to the basic structure of mil 101 cr and nh2 mil 101 cr in acidic conditions 56 58 in order to solve the problem of an unstable catalyst in the h2 accelerated catalytic fenton reaction system a new type of polyarylether based covalent organic frameworks cofs material named juc 505 was chosen as the carrier of the pd in this paper due to its ability to maintain chemical stability for at least a week in strong acidic or alkaline solutions like hcl h2so4 chromic acid solution and 40 hf 59 the basic structure of juc 505 was depicted in fig 2 thus an improved novel fenton reaction system named chacf juc 505 cofs h2 accelerated catalytic fenton juc 505 was constructed using benzoic acid ba and methanol to quench the oh respectively 60 61 the existence of hydroxyl radical was confirmed by the detection of para hydroxybenzoic acid as well as the inhibition of the removal of the target pollutant smt the basic factors that may affect the reaction process such as the initial concentration of smt feii and h2o2 pd juc 505 content h2 flow and the initial ph were investigated systematically the robustness and morphological changes in the materials were analyzed by the verification of the removal

triplicate measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the pd juc 505 the preparation processes and characterization results of pd juc 505 and pd juc 505 were depicted in supporting information si respectively 3 2 the feii feiii redox cycle in chacf juc 505 system the reduction of feiii in the chacf juc 505 system and other control reaction systems under normal temperature and pressure was depicted in fig 4 a the ferrous ion was not detected when the h2 was directly introduced into the fecl3 aqueous solution without using pd or juc 505 because most of h2 would return to the atmosphere immediately under this condition the feiii could not be directly reduced by h2 in aqueous solution conversely the ferrous ion could be detected after the pd juc 505 or pd juc 505 was introduced into the reaction system leading to an increment from 0 to 22 1 μm in the h2 pd juc 505 system 0 3 32 μm in the h2 juc 505 system and 0 4 58 μm in the h2 pd system according to equ 1 and equ 2 h2 could be adsorbed and activated by juc 505 and pd and the reduction of feiii was accelerated by h 56 57 1 pd 0 5h2 pd h 2 feiii pd h feii pd h during the 3 h reaction process in the chacf juc 505 system the concentration of ferrous ion decreased from 24 98 μm to 14 72 μm as depicted in fig 4 b while in the fenton system it decreased from 24 96 μm to 5 86 μm in 5 min and then decreased slowly to 4 92 μm during the remaining reaction time the ph of chacf juc 505 system was between 2 92 and 3 12 it exhibited a significant downward trend this phenomenon was consistent with the results obtained in our previous study 56 58 it could be further confirmed that the feiii could be reduced using the hydrogen in chacf juc 505 system 3 3 smt degradation in chacf juc 505 system as shown in fig 5 a the stripping operation and the direct reduction of h2 h as well as the direct oxidation of h2o2 was found to be negligible in the removal of smt previous findings showed that this antibiotic could be degraded by the hydroxyl radical 62 67 however only about 6 17 smt could be degraded by oh in the pd h2o2 system equ 3 the degradation efficiency of smt in both of the fenton and fenton h2 system was just about 20 respectively these phenomenon may be attributed to the low yield of oh caused by the low dosage of pd or feii and the complex molecular structure of smt 3 h 2 o 2 pd 2 oh as seen in fig 5 b about 84 7 smt could be adsorbed by juc 505 after 3 h reaction it was consistent with reported results that this material has extremely strong adsorption capacity for the removal of tetracycline oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline hydrochloride due to its huge specific surface area and the interactions of hydrogen bond and electrostatic 59 nevertheless there was no significant improvement in the removal efficiency after the introduction of the h2 or h2o2 therefore the removal of smt could be mainly attributed to the adsorption of juc 505 in these three systems regardless of the introduction of juc 505 or pd juc 505 into the fenton system the removal efficiency of smt could be significantly improved as shown in fig 5 b it could increase to 86 44 in the fenton pd cofs system and it increased to 92 62 in the fenton cofs system compared with previous research works 62 64 the removal efficiency of smt was further improved by the degradation of oh and the adsorption of juc 505 based on the results displayed in the si the specific surface area of pd juc 505 was significantly smaller due to the occupation of cavities or the blocking of the outer surfaces of juc 505 by the pd particles this accounted for the difference in the removal efficiency between the two systems the chacf juc 505 system was constructed after the introduction of h2 into the fenton pd juc 505 system the removal efficiency of smt shown in fig 5 b could be 96 77 in this novel system as seen in fig 5 c h2o2 decreased from 20 mm to about 2 2 mm in the first 5 min and then it slowly decreased to about 1 56 mm in the subsequent time when ba was used as the scavenger of oh the concentration of quenched product p hba gradually increased from 0 to 2 92 μm in the 3 h reaction process therefore the existence of an oh in the chacf juc 505 system can be confirmed both of the gcms and hplc ms were used to identify the degradation intermediates products of smt the sulfanilic acid 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine 2 amino 6 methylpyrimidine 4 carboxylic acid 4 aminophenol 2 pentene formic acid acetic acid and the oxalic acid could be detected as shown in table 1 the sulfate nitrate and ammonium could also be found in the aqueous solution the possible degradation pathway of smt was proposed in fig 6 the cleavage of sn bond was considered to be the major degradation pathway of smt in this novel system it was similar to the degradation pathway of smt in many other fenton like reaction systems reported in previous studies 9 63 68 70 although the oh participated in the degradation of smt in the chacf juc 505 system its contribution to the removal of smt should to be further evaluated as seen in fig 5 c the removal efficiency of smt only deceased to about 81 after using methanol as the quencher of oh it was close to the aforementioned pure adsorption removal efficiency of juc 505 compared with previous related research works 26 60 71 the quenching effect was not significant this could imply that the adsorption of juc 505 contributes more significantly to the removal of smt combined with the removal efficiency of toc depicted in fig 7 a it was only about 9 86 after 3 h reaction in the fenton system it slowly increased to 10 32 in the next 6 h it may be attributed to the complex molecular structure of smt and the insufficient production of oh due to the trace amount dosage of ferrous the removal efficiency of toc could be maintained at 81 after the adsorption of juc 505 for 9 h after the introduction of juc 505 into the fenton system the removal efficiency of toc could be 68 32 after 3 h reaction it slowly increased to 71 42 in the next 6 h undoubtedly the adsorption of juc 505 improved the removal efficiency of smt in the fenton system with the attack of oh the concentration of smt remained in the aqueous solution decreased continuously that may result in the difference in the concentration of smt between the inside and the outside pores of juc 505 the adsorbed smt would be released into the aqueous solution this was a continuous process however the trace amount of ferrous is an indication of the insufficient amount of oh in the juc 505 fenton system the released smt and degradation intermediates of smt could not be effectively mineralized by it therefore the removal efficiency of toc in juc 505 fenton system was lower than that in the juc 505 system the removal efficiency of toc in chacf juc 505 system was 32 46 after 3 h reaction as mentioned above the reduction of feiii could be accelerated by the introduction of hydrogen and pd juc 505 into the fenton system compared with the classic fenton system the oh could be continuously generated by using only trace amount ferrous salt therefore the removal efficiency of toc in chacf juc 505 system was much higher than that in fenton system more production of oh means more smt in the aqueous solution could be degraded and it also means that more smt adsorbed by the juc 505 would be released into the aqueous solution accordingly the degradation intermediates of smt remaining in the aqueous solution would increase too compared with the removal efficiency of toc in the juc 505 fenton system it ultimately resulted in a lower removal efficiency of toc in the chacf juc 505 system in the same reaction condition however it still increased significantly to 44 12 after 9 h reaction there was no noticeable increment in the removal efficiency of toc in the other three systems in the subsequent 6 h of reaction process this reinforcement could be attributed to the continuous degradation of oh due to the reduction of feiii in summary smt could be rapidly adsorbed by juc 505 in the chacf juc 505 system the oh generated by the continuous regeneration of feii enhanced the removal efficiency of smt the removal mechanism of this system was proposed in fig 7 b 3 4 effect of initial ph as seen in fig 8 a about 97 5 of the smt could be removed in 3 h when the initial ph was 3 while the removal efficiency decreased to 94 7 when the initial ph was 1 lower ph value means higher concentration of h as seen in equ 4 equ 9 it should be considered in strong acid conditions that the oxidation and consumption of feii will be accelerated leading to the inhibition of the reduction of feiii with the increasing of initial ph after 3 the removal efficiency of smt was increasingly inhibited that may be attributed to the gradual precipitation of feiii feii and the accelerated spontaneous decomposition of h2o2 when ph 3 56 57 4 feii h2o2 oh oh feiii 5 feiii h2o2 feii ho2 h 6 feii oh feiii oh 7 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 8 feiii ho2 feii o2 h 9 feii ho2 h feiii h2o2 3 5 effect of initial smt concentration under the same reaction conditions it could be approximated that the yield of oh is the same increasing the initial concentration of smt leads to an increase in its loading volume if the degradation of oh is dominant then the higher the initial concentration of smt the higher the residual after reaction as shown in fig 8 b however the removal efficiency was 98 7 98 2 97 5 94 5 and 92 3 when the initial smt was 2 4 mg l 1 6 3 mg l 1 13 5 mg l 1 18 2 mg l 1 and 31 9 mg l 1 respectively increasing the initial concentration of smt resulted in a downward trend in the removal efficiency albeit not significantly the smt removal efficiency was increased by the adsorption of juc 505 thus smoothening out the difference caused by the degradation of the oh 3 6 effect of feii concentration as seen in fig 9 a when the concentration of the ferrous was increased there was a significant increment in the removal efficiency of smt the removal efficiency could be 87 1 only by the adsorption of juc 505 and it could be 87 5 89 6 97 5 98 7 and 99 6 when the ferrous was 6 25 μm 12 5 μm 25 μm 50 μm and 100 μm respectively according to figs 4 a and 5 c feiii could be reduced by hydrogen in this novel system the more feii was used in this reaction the more feiii could be reduced to feii and the more oh would be generated in it however only just a trace amount of ferrous was needed to maintain the operation of this system 3 7 effect of initial hydrogen peroxide dosage the effect of concentrated hydrogen peroxide dosage on the degradation of smt in the chacf juc 505 system could be seen in fig 9 b the removal efficiency of 10 mm initial hydrogen peroxide dosage was faster than the initial hydrogen peroxide dosage of 4 mm and 8 mm more feii will be regenerated through the reduction of feiii the sufficient hydrogen peroxide might ensure the sufficient production of oh to degrade smt however with the increased dosage of hydrogen peroxide more than 10 mm the removal efficiency of smt would decrease gradually the removal efficiency was 98 2 97 5 94 2 and 93 3 when the initial h2o2 dosage was 10 μm 20 μm 60 μm and 160 μm respectively findings from previous studies 53 56 57 showed that both of the h2 and oh could be consumed by the excess h2o2 equ 10 and equ 11 10 h 2 o 2 h 2 pd 2 h 2 o 11 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 3 8 effect of pd juc 505 dosage the effect of pd juc 505 dosage on the removal of smt was depicted in fig 10 a the removal efficiency was only 20 7 when the pd juc 505 dosage was 0 g l 1 when it was increased to 1 5 g l 1 the removal efficiency was significantly increased to 97 5 the more pd juc 505 was added into the reaction system the more specific surface area and pd content was in the aqueous solution and the more hydrogen and smt will be adsorbed however when the pd juc 505 dosage increased from 1 5 g l 1 to 9 g l 1 the removal efficiency gradually decreased from 97 5 to 92 8 according to equ 3 equ 10 and equ 12 equ 15 this may be partly attributed to the consumption of oh hydrogen peroxide and the hydrogen by pd also as shown in fig 10 a with increasing in the dosage of pd juc 505 a significant upward trend in the removal efficiency of smt was observed during the first 0 5 h however except that the pd juc 505 dosage is 0 the difference in the final removal efficiency of smt under other conditions was not significant based on the aforementioned results the smt could be adsorbed by the juc 505 thence the more pd juc 505 was used in this system the more smt would be adsorbed by it the remaining smt in the aqueous solution would be attacked and degraded by the oh leading to decreased concentration of smt in the aqueous solution this may result in the difference in the concentration of smt between the internal and the external pores of the pd juc 505 the adsorbed smt would be released into the aqueous solution in summary it could be inferred that the excessive use of pd juc 505 would not improve the removal effect in this system 3 9 effect of h2 flow as mentioned in fig 5 if the hydrogen was introduced then the feiii could not be effectively reduced the oh could not be continuously produced because of the insufficient feii the removal of smt mainly relied on the adsorption of pd juc 505 as well as the degradation of the oh generated by the reaction between the h2o2 and the feii which was directly added into the system after the introduction of h2 into the system the feii regenerated by the reduction of feiii could participate in the fenton reaction and this led to significant improvement in the removal efficiency of smt as shown in fig 10 b however also as shown in fig 10 b the improvement of the smt removal efficiency was not significant when increasing the flow of h2 it could be 95 6 97 5 96 3 and 95 5 when the h2 flow was 20 ml min 1 60 ml min 1 120 ml min 1 and 240 ml min 1 respectively this may be attributed to the insufficient specific surface area and the pd load caused by the insufficient dosage of pd juc 505 as indicated in section 3 8 the excessive h2 may cause more severe disturbance in the system the adsorbed smt would also be released into the aqueous solution that was not conducive for the removal of smt 3 10 the robustness of chacf juc 505 system in the degradation of smt the continuous removal of smt in the pd h2 fenton system and the chacf juc 505 system was shown in fig 11 about 3 9 smt was degraded in the 1st reaction cycle using the pd h2 fenton system as shown in fig 11 a also it generally maintained a slow decreasing trend in the remaining 5 reaction cycles decreasing to about 1 6 after the final reaction cycle the removal efficiency of smt was significantly lower than that of 4 chlorophenol in the same reaction system 57 58 this may be attributed to the fact that the molecular structure of smt is more complex than that of 4 chlorophenol therefore more reaction time was needed to degrade smt in this system however the longer the reaction progressed the easier the pd particles agglomerated this was not conducive for the generation of oh and the degradation of smt compared with that mentioned above the removal efficiency of smt in the chacf juc 505 system was far higher as seen in fig 11 b over 96 8 smt could be removed in the 1st reaction cycle although it also maintained a decreasing trend in the subsequent 5 reaction cycles the removal efficiency of smt still remained above 83 after 6 reaction cycles the robustness of this novel system was significantly better than that of mhacf mil 101 cr and mhacf nh2 mil 101 cr previously reported 56 58 however compared with the robustness of the cus mil 100 fe fenton like system it still had a certain gap 62 in each reaction cycle of chacf juc 505 system as shown in fig 11 b the ph maintained a gradual decreasing trend it was consistent with the results mentioned in fig 4 b the sufficient supply of feii participating in the fenton reaction was ensured by the reduction of hydrogen according to equ 1 and equ 2 it would cause the acidification of the aqueous solution according to the morphology analysis of the pd juc 505 residual displayed in si although the structure of juc 505 was not changed significantly after 6 consecutive reaction cycles the nano pd particles loaded on this cofs material fell off the pd element was not detected in the aqueous solution they would agglomerate spontaneously in the system that was not conducive for the adsorption of activated h2 as well as the reduction of feiii 56 that may be accounted for the vigorous agitation because most of the pd articles were only loaded on the outer surface of juc 505 in this work 4 conclusions an improved novel fenton reaction system named chacf juc 505 was constructed after the h2 and pd juc 505 was introduced in to the classic fenton reaction system the smt could be quickly removed by the adsorption of juc 505 and it could also be degraded by the continuously generated oh by only trace amount feii because the reduction of feiii was accelerated that may be attributed that the retention time of h2 could be extended by the adsorption and activation of the pd juc 505 the degradation pathway of smt mainly followed the cleavage of the sn bond the proper initial ph condition of this process is 3 the dosage of pd juc 505 hydrogen peroxide and h2 flow needs to be optimized because excessive reagent may accelerate the consumption of oh and the excessive disturbance may accelerate the release of the adsorbed smt into the aqueous solution although the basic structure of juc 505 was stable during the whole process the nano pd particles loaded on this cofs material fell off we sincerely hope that more scholars would participate in related studies to explore more feasible ways of solving the problem associated with the generation of large amounts of iron sludge during the reaction process and thus enhance the efficiency of the fenton reaction system declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13438,a novel chacf juc 505 system through the introduction of h2 and pd juc 505 into the classic fenton system under normal temperature and pressure was developed in this work through the experiment of quenching hydroxyl radical oh by methanol the analysis of degradation intermediates and total organic carbon it was confirmed from the reverse that the target pollutant sulfamethazine smt could be quickly adsorbed by juc 505 the activated hydrogen generated from the adsorbed and activated h2 by pd juc 505 accelerated the reduction of feiii it was confirmed that the continuous production of oh required only a trace amount of iron by the detection of para hydroxybenzoic acid the removal of smt was further enhanced by the degradation of oh the cleavage of sn bond was considered to be the major degradation pathway of smt the concentration of feii in the chacf juc 505 system could be at least 14 72 μm and the removal efficiency of smt was about 96 77 that was 3 and 4 6 times that of the fenton system in the same reaction condition respectively the effects of the dosage of ferrous ion h2o2 and pd juc 505 initial concentration of smt and ph and the flow of h2 were investigated the robustness and morphological changes in pd juc 505 were also systematically analyzed keywords hydrogen feiii reduction fenton reaction adsorption pd juc 505 1 introduction sulfamethazine smt depicted in fig 1 is a stable antibiotic in aqueous environment it is widely used in the prevention and treatment of poultry diseases due to its broad spectrum antibacterial properties 1 5 however this property makes it ineffectively to be removed by using conventional treatment processes 6 10 once it flows into the natural water environment not only does it inhibit and kill microorganisms but also it causes potential antibiotic resistance and carcinogenic risks after entering the human body through the food chain 11 19 therefore it is paramount to research and develop a novel process that could efficiently remove smt compared with other similar technologies fenton process is the most widely used in the degradation of refractory organics under normal temperature and pressure due to its easy operation and high degradation efficiency 20 25 however the consumption rate of feii which is oxidized to feiii is 1 3 magnitude faster than the regeneration rate of feii which is reduced by feiii during the reaction process 26 therefore the ferrous salt and hydrogen peroxide must be used continuously to maintain the generation of hydroxyl radical oh in this acidic system large amounts of iron sludge composed of the oxyhydroxides of feii and feiii are generated during the reaction process due to the adjustment of effluent ph back to 6 9 to satisfy the emission regulatory standard the iron sludge could not be reduced by incineration and landfilling them will occupy a great deal of land resources 27 28 that leads to a significant disadvantage when it comes to the application of the fenton reaction in modern society 29 the key to decreasing the production of iron sludge is to reduce the dosage of ferrous salt accelerating the reduction of feiii back to feii is a promising way to solve this problem in previous studies the energy input from light 30 32 electricity 33 35 and ultrasound 36 37 has been proven to accelerate the reduction of feiii yet the operation is complicated and the energy efficiency needs to be further improved some organics could be used to accelerate the reduction of feiii through chemical reduction 38 40 construction of redox mediators 41 43 and improvement in the efficiency of electron transfer 44 45 however it is almost impossible to accurately control the dosage in practice excessive dosing may lead to potential secondary organic pollution in effluent inorganics such as transition metal sulfides 46 48 oxides 49 and simple substances 50 could also achieve this goal by chemical reduction and the improvement of the efficiency of electron transfer with special structures 51 52 while these technologies yield effective outcomes the potential secondary pollution risks such as the elution of heavy metals and the release of hydrogen sulfide must be carefully evaluated in future applications beside these inorganic reductants feiii could also be reduced by hydrogen the product of the reduction reaction of hydrogen is water 53 however the reduction efficiency is low due to the insoluble of hydrogen under normal temperature the vast majority of h2 will immediately return to gaseous phase after being supplied into the aqueous solution an accelerated catalytic fenton system was constructed by introducing h2 and pd0 into the fenton system the palladium was used to promote the adsorption and activation of h2 the methyl tert butyl ether could be rapidly degraded by it however during the whole process the partial pressure of h2 should be maintained at 0 1 mpa it could be reduced by increasing the dosage of pd0 though it is significantly not economical for application in recent years the emergence of porous crystalline materials with high specific surface area and surface modification has broadened the choice of hydrogen storage materials 54 55 in our previous works an improved h2 accelerated catalytic fenton reaction system named mhacf metallic organic frameworks mofs h2 accelerated catalytic fenton was constructed by introducing pd mofs material such as mil 101 cr and nh2 mil 101 cr and hydrogen into the fenton reaction the mofs materials enhanced the regeneration of feii by accelerating the adsorption and activation of h2 with only trace amount of ferrous the organic pollutant could be continuously degraded however the degradation efficiency decreased continuously due to the gradual damage to the basic structure of mil 101 cr and nh2 mil 101 cr in acidic conditions 56 58 in order to solve the problem of an unstable catalyst in the h2 accelerated catalytic fenton reaction system a new type of polyarylether based covalent organic frameworks cofs material named juc 505 was chosen as the carrier of the pd in this paper due to its ability to maintain chemical stability for at least a week in strong acidic or alkaline solutions like hcl h2so4 chromic acid solution and 40 hf 59 the basic structure of juc 505 was depicted in fig 2 thus an improved novel fenton reaction system named chacf juc 505 cofs h2 accelerated catalytic fenton juc 505 was constructed using benzoic acid ba and methanol to quench the oh respectively 60 61 the existence of hydroxyl radical was confirmed by the detection of para hydroxybenzoic acid as well as the inhibition of the removal of the target pollutant smt the basic factors that may affect the reaction process such as the initial concentration of smt feii and h2o2 pd juc 505 content h2 flow and the initial ph were investigated systematically the robustness and morphological changes in the materials were analyzed by the verification of the removal efficiency of smt and through observation using scanning electron microscope sem transmission electron microscope tem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd and brunauer emmett

coupled with conductivity detector ionpac as23 anion exchange column and ionpac ag23 guard column at 24 c the effluent containing 4 5 mm na2co3 0 8 mm nahco3 was pumped at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the suppression current and injection volume was set to 46 ma and 10 μl respectively 65 the concentration of ammonia was analyzed using nessler s reagent spectrophotometry 66 an ammonium metavanadate spectrophotometry method was used to quantitatively analyze the h2o2 26 the ferrous concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using 110 phenanthroline 57 the concentration of tpd was measured using icp oes agilent 720es usa the ph was determined using phsj 3 f ph meter shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd chn error bars in all figures represent the standard deviation among triplicate measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the pd juc 505 the preparation processes and characterization results of pd juc 505 and pd juc 505 were depicted in supporting information si respectively 3 2 the feii feiii redox cycle in chacf juc 505 system the reduction of feiii in the chacf juc 505 system and other control reaction systems under normal temperature and pressure was depicted in fig 4 a the ferrous ion was not detected when the h2 was directly introduced into the fecl3 aqueous solution without using pd or juc 505 because most of h2 would return to the atmosphere immediately under this condition the feiii could not be directly reduced by h2 in aqueous solution conversely the ferrous ion could be detected after the pd juc 505 or pd juc 505 was introduced into the reaction system leading to an increment from 0 to 22 1 μm in the h2 pd juc 505 system 0 3 32 μm in the h2 juc 505 system and 0 4 58 μm in the h2 pd system according to equ 1 and equ 2 h2 could be adsorbed and activated by juc 505 and pd and the reduction of feiii was accelerated by h 56 57 1 pd 0 5h2 pd h 2 feiii pd h feii pd h during the 3 h reaction process in the chacf juc 505 system the concentration of ferrous ion decreased from 24 98 μm to 14 72 μm as depicted in fig 4 b while in the fenton system it decreased from 24 96 μm to 5 86 μm in 5 min and then decreased slowly to 4 92 μm during the remaining reaction time the ph of chacf juc 505 system was between 2 92 and 3 12 it exhibited a significant downward trend this phenomenon was consistent with the results obtained in our previous study 56 58 it could be further confirmed that the feiii could be reduced using the hydrogen in chacf juc 505 system 3 3 smt degradation in chacf juc 505 system as shown in fig 5 a the stripping operation and the direct reduction of h2 h as well as the direct oxidation of h2o2 was found to be negligible in the removal of smt previous findings showed that this antibiotic could be degraded by the hydroxyl radical 62 67 however only about 6 17 smt could be degraded by oh in the pd h2o2 system equ 3 the degradation efficiency of smt in both of the fenton and fenton h2 system was just about 20 respectively these phenomenon may be attributed to the low yield of oh caused by the low dosage of pd or feii and the complex molecular structure of smt 3 h 2 o 2 pd 2 oh as seen in fig 5 b about 84 7 smt could be adsorbed by juc 505 after 3 h reaction it was consistent with reported results that this material has extremely strong adsorption capacity for the removal of tetracycline oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline hydrochloride due to its huge specific surface area and the interactions of hydrogen bond and electrostatic 59 nevertheless there was no significant improvement in the removal efficiency after the introduction of the h2 or h2o2 therefore the removal of smt could be mainly attributed to the adsorption of juc 505 in these three systems regardless of the introduction of juc 505 or pd juc 505 into the fenton system the removal efficiency of smt could be significantly improved as shown in fig 5 b it could increase to 86 44 in the fenton pd cofs system and it increased to 92 62 in the fenton cofs system compared with previous research works 62 64 the removal efficiency of smt was further improved by the degradation of oh and the adsorption of juc 505 based on the results displayed in the si the specific surface area of pd juc 505 was significantly smaller due to the occupation of cavities or the blocking of the outer surfaces of juc 505 by the pd particles this accounted for the difference in the removal efficiency between the two systems the chacf juc 505 system was constructed after the introduction of h2 into the fenton pd juc 505 system the removal efficiency of smt shown in fig 5 b could be 96 77 in this novel system as seen in fig 5 c h2o2 decreased from 20 mm to about 2 2 mm in the first 5 min and then it slowly decreased to about 1 56 mm in the subsequent time when ba was used as the scavenger of oh the concentration of quenched product p hba gradually increased from 0 to 2 92 μm in the 3 h reaction process therefore the existence of an oh in the chacf juc 505 system can be confirmed both of the gcms and hplc ms were used to identify the degradation intermediates products of smt the sulfanilic acid 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine 2 amino 6 methylpyrimidine 4 carboxylic acid 4 aminophenol 2 pentene formic acid acetic acid and the oxalic acid could be detected as shown in table 1 the sulfate nitrate and ammonium could also be found in the aqueous solution the possible degradation pathway of smt was proposed in fig 6 the cleavage of sn bond was considered to be the major degradation pathway of smt in this novel system it was similar to the degradation pathway of smt in many other fenton like reaction systems reported in previous studies 9 63 68 70 although the oh participated in the degradation of smt in the chacf juc 505 system its contribution to the removal of smt should to be further evaluated as seen in fig 5 c the removal efficiency of smt only deceased to about 81 after using methanol as the quencher of oh it was close to the aforementioned pure adsorption removal efficiency of juc 505 compared with previous related research works 26 60 71 the quenching effect was not significant this could imply that the adsorption of juc 505 contributes more significantly to the removal of smt combined with the removal efficiency of toc depicted in fig 7 a it was only about 9 86 after 3 h reaction in the fenton system it slowly increased to 10 32 in the next 6 h it may be attributed to the complex molecular structure of smt and the insufficient production of oh due to the trace amount dosage of ferrous the removal efficiency of toc could be maintained at 81 after the adsorption of juc 505 for 9 h after the introduction of juc 505 into the fenton system the removal efficiency of toc could be 68 32 after 3 h reaction it slowly increased to 71 42 in the next 6 h undoubtedly the adsorption of juc 505 improved the removal efficiency of smt in the fenton system with the attack of oh the concentration of smt remained in the aqueous solution decreased continuously that may result in the difference in the concentration of smt between the inside and the outside pores of juc 505 the adsorbed smt would be released into the aqueous solution this was a continuous process however the trace amount of ferrous is an indication of the insufficient amount of oh in the juc 505 fenton system the released smt and degradation intermediates of smt could not be effectively mineralized by it therefore the removal efficiency of toc in juc 505 fenton system was lower than that in the juc 505 system the removal efficiency of toc in chacf juc 505 system was 32 46 after 3 h reaction as mentioned above the reduction of feiii could be accelerated by the introduction of hydrogen and pd juc 505 into the fenton system compared with the classic fenton system the oh could be continuously generated by using only trace amount ferrous salt therefore the removal efficiency of toc in chacf juc 505 system was much higher than that in fenton system more production of oh means more smt in the aqueous solution could be degraded and it also means that more smt adsorbed by the juc 505 would be released into the aqueous solution accordingly the degradation intermediates of smt remaining in the aqueous solution would increase too compared with the removal efficiency of toc in the juc 505 fenton system it ultimately resulted in a lower removal efficiency of toc in the chacf juc 505 system in the same reaction condition however it still increased significantly to 44 12 after 9 h reaction there was no noticeable increment in the removal efficiency of toc in the other three systems in the subsequent 6 h of reaction process this reinforcement could be attributed to the continuous degradation of oh due to the reduction of feiii in summary smt could be rapidly adsorbed by juc 505 in the chacf juc 505 system the oh generated by the continuous regeneration of feii enhanced the removal efficiency of smt the removal mechanism of this system was proposed in fig 7 b 3 4 effect of initial ph as seen in fig 8 a about 97 5 of the smt could be removed in 3 h when the initial ph was 3 while the removal efficiency decreased to 94 7 when the initial ph was 1 lower ph value means higher concentration of h as seen in equ 4 equ 9 it should be considered in strong acid conditions that the oxidation and consumption of feii will be accelerated leading to the inhibition of the reduction of feiii with the increasing of initial ph after 3 the removal efficiency of smt was increasingly inhibited that may be attributed to the gradual precipitation of feiii feii and the accelerated spontaneous decomposition of h2o2 when ph 3 56 57 4 feii h2o2 oh oh feiii 5 feiii h2o2 feii ho2 h 6 feii oh feiii oh 7 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 8 feiii ho2 feii o2 h 9 feii ho2 h feiii h2o2 3 5 effect of initial smt concentration under the same reaction conditions it could be approximated that the yield of oh is the same increasing the initial concentration of smt leads to an increase in its loading volume if the degradation of oh is dominant then the higher the initial concentration of smt the higher the residual after reaction as shown in fig 8 b however the removal efficiency was 98 7 98 2 97 5 94 5 and 92 3 when the initial smt was 2 4 mg l 1 6 3 mg l 1 13 5 mg l 1 18 2 mg l 1 and 31 9 mg l 1 respectively increasing the initial concentration of smt resulted in a downward trend in the removal efficiency albeit not significantly the smt removal efficiency was increased by the adsorption of juc 505 thus smoothening out the difference caused by the degradation of the oh 3 6 effect of feii concentration as seen in fig 9 a when the concentration of the ferrous was increased there was a significant increment in the removal efficiency of smt the removal efficiency could be 87 1 only by the adsorption of juc 505 and it could be 87 5 89 6 97 5 98 7 and 99 6 when the ferrous was 6 25 μm 12 5 μm 25 μm 50 μm and 100 μm respectively according to figs 4 a and 5 c feiii could be reduced by hydrogen in this novel system the more feii was used in this reaction the more feiii could be reduced to feii and the more oh would be generated in it however only just a trace amount of ferrous was needed to maintain the operation of this system 3 7 effect of initial hydrogen peroxide dosage the effect of concentrated hydrogen peroxide dosage on the degradation of smt in the chacf juc 505 system could be seen in fig 9 b the removal efficiency of 10 mm initial hydrogen peroxide dosage was faster than the initial hydrogen peroxide dosage of 4 mm and 8 mm more feii will be regenerated through the reduction of feiii the sufficient hydrogen peroxide might ensure the sufficient production of oh to degrade smt however with the increased dosage of hydrogen peroxide more than 10 mm the removal efficiency of smt would decrease gradually the removal efficiency was 98 2 97 5 94 2 and 93 3 when the initial h2o2 dosage was 10 μm 20 μm 60 μm and 160 μm respectively findings from previous studies 53 56 57 showed that both of the h2 and oh could be consumed by the excess h2o2 equ 10 and equ 11 10 h 2 o 2 h 2 pd 2 h 2 o 11 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 3 8 effect of pd juc 505 dosage the effect of pd juc 505 dosage on the removal of smt was depicted in fig 10 a the removal efficiency was only 20 7 when the pd juc 505 dosage was 0 g l 1 when it was increased to 1 5 g l 1 the removal efficiency was significantly increased to 97 5 the more pd juc 505 was added into the reaction system the more specific surface area and pd content was in the aqueous solution and the more hydrogen and smt will be adsorbed however when the pd juc 505 dosage increased from 1 5 g l 1 to 9 g l 1 the removal efficiency gradually decreased from 97 5 to 92 8 according to equ 3 equ 10 and equ 12 equ 15 this may be partly attributed to the consumption of oh hydrogen peroxide and the hydrogen by pd also as shown in fig 10 a with increasing in the dosage of pd juc 505 a significant upward trend in the removal efficiency of smt was observed during the first 0 5 h however except that the pd juc 505 dosage is 0 the difference in the final removal efficiency of smt under other conditions was not significant based on the aforementioned results the smt could be adsorbed by the juc 505 thence the more pd juc 505 was used in this system the more smt would be adsorbed by it the remaining smt in the aqueous solution would be attacked and degraded by the oh leading to decreased concentration of smt in the aqueous solution this may result in the difference in the concentration of smt between the internal and the external pores of the pd juc 505 the adsorbed smt would be released into the aqueous solution in summary it could be inferred that the excessive use of pd juc 505 would not improve the removal effect in this system 3 9 effect of h2 flow as mentioned in fig 5 if the hydrogen was introduced then the feiii could not be effectively reduced the oh could not be continuously produced because of the insufficient feii the removal of smt mainly relied on the adsorption of pd juc 505 as well as the degradation of the oh generated by the reaction between the h2o2 and the feii which was directly added into the system after the introduction of h2 into the system the feii regenerated by the reduction of feiii could participate in the fenton reaction and this led to significant improvement in the removal efficiency of smt as shown in fig 10 b however also as shown in fig 10 b the improvement of the smt removal efficiency was not significant when increasing the flow of h2 it could be 95 6 97 5 96 3 and 95 5 when the h2 flow was 20 ml min 1 60 ml min 1 120 ml min 1 and 240 ml min 1 respectively this may be attributed to the insufficient specific surface area and the pd load caused by the insufficient dosage of pd juc 505 as indicated in section 3 8 the excessive h2 may cause more severe disturbance in the system the adsorbed smt would also be released into the aqueous solution that was not conducive for the removal of smt 3 10 the robustness of chacf juc 505 system in the degradation of smt the continuous removal of smt in the pd h2 fenton system and the chacf juc 505 system was shown in fig 11 about 3 9 smt was degraded in the 1st reaction cycle using the pd h2 fenton system as shown in fig 11 a also it generally maintained a slow decreasing trend in the remaining 5 reaction cycles decreasing to about 1 6 after the final reaction cycle the removal efficiency of smt was significantly lower than that of 4 chlorophenol in the same reaction system 57 58 this may be attributed to the fact that the molecular structure of smt is more complex than that of 4 chlorophenol therefore more reaction time was needed to degrade smt in this system however the longer the reaction progressed the easier the pd particles agglomerated this was not conducive for the generation of oh and the degradation of smt compared with that mentioned above the removal efficiency of smt in the chacf juc 505 system was far higher as seen in fig 11 b over 96 8 smt could be removed in the 1st reaction cycle although it also maintained a decreasing trend in the subsequent 5 reaction cycles the removal efficiency of smt still remained above 83 after 6 reaction cycles the robustness of this novel system was significantly better than that of mhacf mil 101 cr and mhacf nh2 mil 101 cr previously reported 56 58 however compared with the robustness of the cus mil 100 fe fenton like system it still had a certain gap 62 in each reaction cycle of chacf juc 505 system as shown in fig 11 b the ph maintained a gradual decreasing trend it was consistent with the results mentioned in fig 4 b the sufficient supply of feii participating in the fenton reaction was ensured by the reduction of hydrogen according to equ 1 and equ 2 it would cause the acidification of the aqueous solution according to the morphology analysis of the pd juc 505 residual displayed in si although the structure of juc 505 was not changed significantly after 6 consecutive reaction cycles the nano pd particles loaded on this cofs material fell off the pd element was not detected in the aqueous solution they would agglomerate spontaneously in the system that was not conducive for the adsorption of activated h2 as well as the reduction of feiii 56 that may be accounted for the vigorous agitation because most of the pd articles were only loaded on the outer surface of juc 505 in this work 4 conclusions an improved novel fenton reaction system named chacf juc 505 was constructed after the h2 and pd juc 505 was introduced in to the classic fenton reaction system the smt could be quickly removed by the adsorption of juc 505 and it could also be degraded by the continuously generated oh by only trace amount feii because the reduction of feiii was accelerated that may be attributed that the retention time of h2 could be extended by the adsorption and activation of the pd juc 505 the degradation pathway of smt mainly followed the cleavage of the sn bond the proper initial ph condition of this process is 3 the dosage of pd juc 505 hydrogen peroxide and h2 flow needs to be optimized because excessive reagent may accelerate the consumption of oh and the excessive disturbance may accelerate the release of the adsorbed smt into the aqueous solution although the basic structure of juc 505 was stable during the whole process the nano pd particles loaded on this cofs material fell off we sincerely hope that more scholars would participate in related studies to explore more feasible ways of solving the problem associated with the generation of large amounts of iron sludge during the reaction process and thus enhance the efficiency of the fenton reaction system declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13439,the study demonstrates formation of salt tolerant aerobic granules by using brevibacterium paucivorans staphylococcus hominis and micrococcus aloeverae evaluating organics removal and nitrification efficiencies in refinery wastewater treatment enhanced extracellular polymeric substances eps production during salinity exposure and gradual salt adaptation helped to reduce granule

volatile suspended solids vss of 2 7 2 4 mm and 5 3 g l respectively however at 35 g l salinity the cocci abundance in staphylococcus granules provided moderate stability with 2 5 0 09 mm granule size but micrococcus granules achieved the smallest 0 9 0 02 mm and strongest granules integrity coefficient 12 0 12 due to refinery sludge origin and maximum 226 mg g vss eps content high performance liquid chromatography hplc peaks suggested that micrococcus had the fastest 12 h complete phenolics removal efficiency among the three strains and salt tolerance improved nitrification up to 28 by protecting nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob layers about 330 10 mg l of tph and 35 g nacl l salt tolerance indicated micrococcus granules to be the best fitted inoculum in hypersaline 30 g l salinity refinery wastewater treatment keywords oil degraders single strain granulation refinery wastewater nitrification salt tolerance 1 introduction aerobic granulation has become a popular biotechnology in recalcitrant wastewater treatment for its unique characteristics like granule compactness high settling velocity high biomass retention with microbial diversity possessing pollutant tolerance and degrading properties in adverse condition 1 2 effluent generated from petrochemical leather processing paper and agro based food industries contain high concentration of dissolved inorganic salts 3 wastewater containing 20 and 30 g l salinity are considered as saline and hypersaline wastewater respectively 4 crude oil recovery distillation and alkylation are the major steps in petroleum refining process to produce hypersaline wastewater in aquifer zone saline water is applied to maintain oil reservoir pressure and emulsifier is used for enhanced oil recovery which is a source of wastewater containing emulsified oil total dissolved solids tds nh4 n ammonia nitrogen and salts 5 a mixture of h2s and alkali commonly known as spent caustic is largely used in alkylation step and can increase salinity of refinery effluent up to 300 g l 6 membrane separations like reverse osmosis membrane distillation and pervaporations are the most commonly used techniques for saline wastewater treatment 7 recent advancements in membrane technology introduced composite hollow fiber membranes hybrid nanofiltration reverse osmosis and metal organic frameworks mof integrated membranes for desalination purpose 8 10 however high cost membrane materials membrane fouling maintenance of sophisticated reactors and moreover production of massive volume of refinery wastewater having several oil phenolics salts ammonia and metals are the major challenges of membrane separation for saline oily wastewater 11 biological treatments are considered to be slower stable but economical than physicochemical processes for emulsified oil removal from refinery wastewater however salinity intrusion in reactors having flocculent sludge resulted into osmotic shock which reduced specific oxygen uptake rate sour hampering cell growth rate disrupting enzymatic pathways microbial metabolism and cod chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency 3 aerobic granular reactors agrs were reported to enhance eps production to achieve saline shock resistant granules with high biomass concentration and reduced biomass washout while treating seawater fish canning wastewater or fabricated synthetic wastewater in 2 75 g l salinity range 3 4 12 15 recent advancements in aerobic granulation technology included several strategies like use of halophilic granules of autochthonous seawater microbes to treat saline seawater or stepwise increase in salinity from 0 20 g l in agr at low temperature 16 c for salinity adaptation in granules and application of short term saline shock ranging from 0 60 g l for cultivating salt tolerant granules and providing elevated phenol concentration to achieve about 90 cod removal with improved nitrification and phosphorus removal in low saline wastewater 3 4 15 16 but in hypersaline oily wastewater prolonged granulation period of 30 50 days initial granule rupture and depletion of ammonia oxidising layer reducing nitrogen removal were the major problems faced in agrs 17 18 rapid granulation was carried out by researchers by adding chemical agents like poly aluminium chloride pac and biochar or dry granules in agrs which require chemical use with processing time and cost further indicating necessity of self granulating seed inoculum for rapid granulation in wastewater treatment plants 19 21 agrs were mostly fed with co substrates mixed with oily effluent or in lower hydrocarbon concentration 6 8 151 mg l than real refinery wastewater 250 mg l 17 22 23 moreover nitrogen removal and nitrification are not well explored in dual presence of hydrocarbon recalcitrance and salinity in agrs role of inoculum and microorganism was another important aspect for salt tolerance in aerobic granules literature documented the use of mixed sludge inoculum or salt adapted bio granules and presence of halophilic bacteria like devosia sphingomonas muricauda etc during petroleum slop or phenol o cresol and p nitrophenol contaminated saline wastewater treatment 18 22 23 however rapid granulation from specific bacteria along with salt tolerance nitrification and organics removal in high strength refinery wastewater are not discussed earlier the aim of the study was to conduct batch scale study on rapid aerobic granulation using three bacterial strains named brevibacterium paucivorans strain sg001 staphylococcus hominis strain sg003 and micrococcus aloeverae strain sg002 for treatment of hypersaline refinery wastewater containing phenol cresol and diesel oil and to investigate the impacts of salt tolerance on granule characteristics biomass activity with organics and nitrogen removal efficiency in these three strains to determine their oil and salt tolerance thresholds 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum sources in our previous study three oil degrading bacterial strains of brevibacterium paucivorans strain sg001 staphylococcus hominis strain sg003 and micrococcus aloeverae strain sg002 were isolated from sewage brewery and refinery sludge granules by streak plate method using nutrient broth and subculturing in emulsified diesel media after genomic dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing bacterial identification was done by constructing phylogenetic tree in neighbor joining method as described in ghosh and chakraborty 24 liquid cultures of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus degraded almost 33 61 oil in 48 h in presence of 320 mg l of emulsified diesel in current study about 3 g l of overnight grown culture of brevibacterium and staphylococcus were inoculated in b1 and b2 batches respectively b3 was inoculated with granulated micrococcus culture grown in a measuring cylinder in 15 days having 0 62 0 2 mm size and 6 72 0 43 g l vss content 2 2 synthetic refinery wastewater a combined refinery wastewater was collected after gravitational separation of heavy oils from indian oil corporation limited iocl refinery guwahati india and was characterized the ph conductivity and turbidity of the

between 30 50 mg l nh4 n po4 3 so4 4 and cl ions were found in 51 1 250 1 5 100 0 33 and 250 1 mg l concentrations respectively presence of trace amount of heavy metals like fe pb cu cr ni and zn were also detected in the effluent b1 b2 and b3 were fed with synthetic refinery wastewater prepared according to the characteristics of the real wastewater about 330 mg l of tph was provided for 1300 mg l cod and 190 mg l nh4cl was applied for 50 mg l nh4 n in the feed the diesel phenol o m and p cresol concentrations were maintained at 234 50 40 and 30 mg l respectively diesel was emulsified in nonylphenol ethoxylate 200 1 v v ratio about 1 ml l trace metal solution and phosphate buffer were also added to the feed to maintain bacterial growth and feed ph 7 0 2 buffer contained 72 3 g l

outlet at 17 5 cm height from the base batch feeding and reaction times were 10 and 1418 min respectively the first 21 days was the granulation phase in last 49 days feed salinity was increased from 5 35 g l of nacl concentration in every 7 days interval table 1 provides details of day wise increasing nacl concentration and corresponding conductivity profiles in the batches sterile condition was maintained inside the batches by using sterilized measuring cylinders aeration pipes and wastewater with cotton plugging in b1 and b2 till 21 25 days of matured granulation 25 to maintain real environment non sterile synthetic refinery wastewater was used during salinity exposure 2 4 analytical procedures the salinity and conductivity of the feed and effluent samples were measured by

staphylococcus strains rapid granulation occurred in 10 days of inoculation of brevibacterium and staphylococcus in b1 and b2 optimum granule size is considered within 0 2 16 mm of diameter 37 and in current study the initial granule size was nearly 0 2 to 0 3 mm which was within the mentioned range after 21 25 days of batch operation matured yellowish granules were formed having 1 43 0 01 and 1 56 0 05 mm diameter with 4 3 0 01 and 3 47 0 04 g l of biomass concentration vss in b1 and b2 respectively fig 2 describes granule size vss ic settleability and eps profiles during granulation phase in b1 and b2 the oil degrading nature and granular sludge origin of the strains helped to utilize oily wastewater to granulate and grow 24 granule settling behaviour is determined by two parameters gsv and svi30 where gsv is correlated with granule size and svi30 determines volume occupied by settled sludge after 30 min settling time about 30 70 m h of gsv range and below 50 ml g of svi30 are essential for matured granulation 38 39 in 25 days with increasing size and density gsv increased whereas svi30 decreased from 31 to 34 m h and 53 to 47 ml g in b1 and 32 to 35 m h and 41 to 36 ml g in b2 respectively high granule strength determines low integrity coefficient ic of granules 34 about 37 25 0 56 31 9 0 34 ic values indicated initiation of granule structural integrity in brevibacterium and staphylococcus granules eps are the polymers containing proteins pn and polysaccharides ps on outer granule layer enhancing cell surface hydrophobicity for cell aggregation in 21 days of batch operation eps concentration triggered up to 73 0 27 and 84 0 12 mg g vss in b1 and b2 with 74 79 hydrophobicity values suggesting stable aerobic granules treating recalcitrant refinery wastewater literature suggested that matured granulation from mixed inoculums like petrochemical sludge and flocculent municipal activated sludge took minimum 30 50 days while treating recalcitrant petroleum slop or hypesaline oily wastewater 17 18 23 autochthonous seawater microbes took almost 110 days for granular sludge formation in hypersaline seawater 4 however in current study rapid granulation in nearly 20 days from single strain bacteria in complex refinery wastewater determines its feasibility to withstand hydrocarbon recalcitrance in real refinery wastewater treatment plants 3 2 granule characterization in saline refinery wastewater during the salinity influence phase day 26 70 a significant variation in granule characteristics was observed in brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus granules photographs of the aerobic granules taken on day 65 are shown in fig s1 supplementary materials changes in granule size vss ic and comparative svi30 to gsv profiles in b1 b2 and b3 are described in fig 2a d between day 26 42 in presence of 330 mg l tph and 5 15 g l nacl salinity b1 b2 and b3 developed granules with 0 7 2 35 mm size 4 81 7 7 g l vss and 176 178 mg g vss of eps content however after 20 g l nacl exposure brevibacterium granules faced partial disintegration decreasing size and vss from 2 7 2 4 mm and 5 4 g l which gradually increased effluent vss up to 0 74 g l granule rupture eventually decreased gsv and increased svi30 in b1 till 32 m h and 45 ml g respectively ic profile hiked from 27 to 29 in b1 indicating reduction in granule strength day 49 onwards at 25 35 g l nacl salinity b1 acclimatized in hydrocarbon and saline environment achieving stability at 2 15 0 11 mm diameter and 3 0 04 g l vss b2 granules had moderate granule strength ic 21 in presence of 20 35 g l nacl which stabilized at 2 5 0 09 mm granule size and 5 78 0 09 g l vss in 49 days micrococcus had the smallest size 0 9 0 03 mm and strongest granules ic 12 0 12 at 35 g l nacl suggesting the most salt tolerant granules among the batches at 330 mg l tph exposure due to bigger size staphylococcus granules b2 achieved 38 m h gsv but the higher biomass density vss 8 23 0 06 g l and microbial strength ic 12 provided maximum 43 m h gsv in small sized b3 granules 38 low svi30 range 41 28 ml g in b2 and b3 further indicated highly settleable granules 39 mixed inoculum promoted 70 80 m h of gsv and about 30 ml g of svi5 in aerobic granules treating hypersaline oily wastewater containing 5 6 mg l oil 17 and stepwise increase in salinity till 38 g nacl l provided stable aerobic granules with 20 ml g svi5 and svi30 values in 164 days 40 hence current study indicates the feasibility of using single strains of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus to achieve faster stronger and more stable granulation than the previous studies while treating hypersaline refinery wastewater 3 3 extracellular polymeric substances comparative eps with pn and hydrophobicity trends in b1 b2 and b3 are illustrated in fig 2e f in b1 oil toxicity and saline shock initially reduced eps and pn synthesis between 177 170 and 129 117 mg g vss salt adaptation gradually stabilized eps content at 168 0 33 mg g vss with 79 hydrophobicity in brevibacterium granules at 35 g l nacl salinity till day 70 b2 granules reached stable eps and pn concentrations at 210 0 22 and 169 1 mg g vss providing 84 hydrophobicity the mechanism behind granule formation and stability in hypersaline refinery wastewater might be the inherited oil tolerance from refinery sludge origin which provided high biomass content to form micrococcus granules and the saline shock in feed which promoted osmotic pressure increasing microbial activity for eps synthesis in granules 41 eps are the base materials to increase cell to cell adhesion for granule formation and stability 42 according to literature bigger granules in b1 and b2 might be a possible reason of lower eps content than smaller granules in b3 under salinity influence 15 hence salinity stress promoted 226 mg g vss of eps layer with 91 hydrophobicity in micrococcus granules which acted as a shield to resist granule rupture during petroleum slop wastewater treatment pn ps values were found near 9 at 11 24 g l of salinity which deteriorated to a ratio of 3 4 resulting into partial degranulation at 37 g l salinity 23 in current study even in presence of hypersalinity 35 g nacl l and high hydrocarbon concentration 330 mg l pn ps trend was observed between 4 5 9 5 in b2 and b3 suggesting granule robustness and structural stability with higher proportion of bound proteins according to sivasubramanian et al 43 higher na ion concentration might have associated with promoting protein synthesis enzymes in micrococcus and staphylococcus granules but saline exposure increased the hydrophilic polysaccharides production in brevibacterium which reduced pn ps ratio up to 2 causing granule rupture hampering granule settleability table 2 provides a comparison between two scenarios mixed sludge inoculated aerobic granules treating saline wastewater and specific strain originated aerobic granules treating refinery wastewater in dual presence of hydrocarbon recalcitrance and saline stress the table showed that the previous studies focused on saline water treatment 0 38 g l salinity mostly added with co substrates with or without presence of recalcitrant organic pollutants where salt adapted or mixed sludge inoculated aerobic granules were used in agrs dominance of halophilic bacteria was also evident in aerobic granules in contrast current study indicated utility of single strain inoculum for rapid formation of salt tolerant granules by using refinery wastewater as sole substrate with 330 mg l tph concentration and about 35 g nacl l salinity providing 93 organics removal and improved nitrification than earlier studies 3 4 microscopic image analysis fig s2 supplementary materials provides fesem images of b1 b2 and b3 granules taken on day 65 at 5000 magnification non filamentous microstructure with rod shaped bacterial population suggested that after initial rupture brevibacteriam b1 granules acclimatized in saline environment achieving denser granules cocci abundance on staphylococcus and micrococcus granule surfaces ensured strong microbial structure in b2 and b3 which is further justified by their high vss 5 8 g l content and low ic values 12 21 clsm analysis was conducted on day 65 of the study fig s3 supplementary materials extended fluorescence of syto 63 indicated high amount of total cells in b1 b2 and b3 granules high fitc fluorescence in b3 further signified maximum protein content in micrococcus granules among the three strains con a fluorescence was comparatively higher in brevibacterium as polysaccharides content increased in saline environment decreasing pn ps ratio between 2 4 in b1 higher sytox blue fluorescence in b1 suggested more number of dead cells in brevibacterium granules than b2 and b3 due to granule rupture in saline shock 3 5 performances of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus granules 3 5 1 organics removal performances the cod tph phenol o m p cresol and emulsified diesel removal profiles are described in fig 3 the influent cod and tph concentrations were constant at 1300 mg l and 330 mg l providing 0 95 kg cod m3 day of organic loading rate olr and 0 495 kg m3 day of hydrocarbon loading rate hlr throughout 70 days of the study emulsified diesel phenol o m and p cresol feeding were maintained at 234 50 40 30 and 30 mg l concentrations respectively previously brevibacterium paucivorans and staphylococcus hominis cultures were observed to degrade 33 28 0 84 and 38 18 0 90 tph after 48 h of inoculation in oily wastewater having 320 mg l influent tph concentration 24 in current study brevibacterium b1 and staphylococcus b2 achieved almost 73 75 cod and tph removal in granulation phase day 1 25 confirming granulated strains were more hydrocarbon tolerant and efficient in organics removal than their liquid culture after 20 g l nacl exposure partial granule rupture and vss reduction dropped tph removal from 75 to 70 in b1 in last 20 days at 25 35 g l nacl b1 reached nearly stable 70 71 cod and tph removal due to stable vss and eps concentration after 70 days of complete batch operation b1 provided 15 5 40 48 0 75 5 44 mg l of effluent phenol oil and cresol concentrations respectively till day 49 b2 had 80 81 cod and tph removals staphylococcus granules achieved stability at 20 35 g l nacl providing 82 and 95 97 of tph and phenolics removal respectively the cocci dominated strong granules with 5 77 g l vss ensured salt tolerance with 80 9 cod removal from refinery wastewater in b2 the final oil phenol and cresol concentrations in b2 effluent were 40 38 5 35 and 0 9 5 44 mg l respectively the smallest strongest micrococcus granules with maximum 8 34 g l vss concentration ensured maximum 92 2 cod and 92 7 tph removal in b3 between day 26 49 it remained stable at 92 8 tph removal up to 35 g l nacl till day 70 indicating the most salt tolerant oil degrading granules among the three strains almost complete phenolics and 89 7 diesel removal were achieved in b3 on day 70 the hydrocarbon degradation rates were calculated as 14 9 0 32 25 78 0 12 and 46 34 0 45 mg oil g vss day in b1 b2 and b3 respectively the stable hydrocarbon removal in b1 b2 and b3 even in salinity stress can be explained in two ways salinity increases water density causing loose biomass washout from reactors whereas bigger and denser granular sludge with good settling property remain inside the reactor 22 the high biomass concentration determines high microbial activity degrading recalcitrant diesel oil phenol and cresol compounds by aerobic granules the another possible reason might be the combined impact of salinity stress and osmotic pressure enhanced eps synthesis and conversion of hydrocarbons into proteins during feast phase of the batch operation nearly 12 h of cycle discussed in section 3 7 the proteins are utilized in famine phase increasing cell surface hydrophobicity of the granules the eps layer works as a barrier between cell wall and external environment and protects the granules from harsh saline exposure 40 refinery wastewater treatment plants often suffer from two problems high oil concentration above 250 mg l and high salinity 35 37 g l nacl 23 44 hydrocarbon recalcitrance and saline stress causes biomass washout from biological treatment plants and chemical treatments involve use of costly chemicals and technologies which are not economically and environmentally viable 3 in current study aerobic granulation from brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus strains in hypersaline refinery wastewater solved the granule rupture and slow granulation faced in mixed inoculum and granules were capable of degrading oil phenol and cresols with nitrification within a threshold limit of salt and hydrocarbon concentration the study reflected its practical applicability in refinery effluent treatment plants by using micrococcus granules at 0 9 0 95 kg cod m3 day of olr range for simultaneous 93 hydrocarbon removal and 28 nitrification at 330 10 mg l hydrocarbon and 35 g nacl l salinity tolerance thresholds respectively corsino et al 17 and campo and di bella 23 observed that in salinity influence eps production enhanced physical bio adsorption of oil in granules while treating petroleum wastewater in current study volatilization and adsorption study confirmed that only 1 2 tph was removed abiotically or by adsorption on dead granule surface indicating that organics were removed by biodegradation in granules 24 corsino et al 17 observed 90 hydrocarbon removal by aerobic granules in hypersaline oily wastewater where tph concentration was only 5 6 mg l zhang et al 45 suggested co metabolism degradation mechanism where oil and sodium acetate were simultaneously degraded in the agr in another study ramos et al 22 achieved complete phenolics removal in agr treatment of aromatic wastewater having phenol o cresol and p nitrophenol where glucose and sucrose were simultaneously fed as co substrates moreover they faced complete granule disintegration at 29 g l salinity which was reconstructed after adding anaerobic granules in contrast in current study recalcitrant diesel and phenolics were used as sole carbon source for granules that too with higher tph content 330 mg l than previous literature which achieved stability between 25 35 g l salinity providing 71 93 organics removal without adding new sludge or substrate degradation of diesel oil having c6 c36 carbons has been studied in our previous work which followed a pathway where n alkane was converted to alcohol further sequentially oxidized into aldehydes and then into fatty acids such as tridecanoic acid c13 or octadecanoic acid c18 46 the fatty acids were observed to take part in β oxidation providing cell metabolic energy 47 aerobic degradation of phenolic compounds can be predicted to follow the phenol to catechol conversion pathway as previously observed in agrs treating o cresol by basheer and farooqi 48 catechol degradation is subdivided into ortho and meta pathways ortho pathway converts catechol into cis cis muconate which is utilized in tca cycle meta pathway can cleave the catechol ring to produce 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hmsa which is further oxidized into muconolactone literature evidences of halophile dominance like autochthonous halophilic bacteria and other strains like devosia sphingomonas muricauda stappiaceae rhodobacteraceae halomonas nitzschia etc in granules helped in either eps synthesis of aromatic compound degradation to achieve stability between 2 60 g l salt stress in sea water and aromatic saline wastewater treatment 4 13 22 49 b1 b2 and b3 followed similar organics removal trends as observed in sewage brewery and refinery sludge granules origin of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus strains discussed in our previous paper 24 hence the refinery sludge origin oil adaptation and high eps content were the key factors to resist salinity inhibition for maximum hydrocarbon removal efficiency in micrococcus granules which can be further best fitted in agr scale treatment of hypersaline above 30 g nacl l salinity refinery wastewater 3 5 2 nitrogen removal performance nitrogen loading rate was 0 075 kg nh4 n m3 day nh4 n removal patterns and variations in effluent no3 n and no2 n concentrations are described in fig 4 in granulation phase day1 25 b1 and b2 had 92 94 nh4 n removals which further increseased upto 93 and 95 in 15 g l nacl exposure with no granule rapture however after day 49 nh4 n removal dropped to 89 in b1 due to partial rupture in 20 g nacl l salinity poor nh4 n removal was previously reported in agrs treating real petroleum wastewater 18 45 as nitrifying bacterial growth in outer aerobic granule layer can be restricted by hydrocarbon toxicity in salinity exposure 50 finally after saline stress adaptation b1 maintained stability with 89 nh4 n removal between 25 35 g l salinity influene b2 had stable 95 6 nh4 n removal till day 70 at 25 35 g l salinity influence due to less granule rapture and high vss values micrococcus granules in b3 had 95 nh4 n removal capacity which followed stable removal pattern in 5 20 g l of nacl concentration the previous oil adaptation strong microbial integrity ic 12 and highest vss concentration 8 34 g l promoted 96 nh4 n removal in b3 in further salinity of 25 35 g l nacl till day 70 during nitrification nh4 is initially converted to no2 by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and further tranformed to no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob ion chromatography results provided negligible amount of effluent no2 n concentrations 0 01 0 02 mg l indicating almost absence of partial nitrification in the batches sludge retention time srt determines the mean retention time activated sludge solid retain in a wastewater treatment plant which is calculated according to eqn 2 51 2 s r t d a y x v t x w v w t c where x is the vss inside the reactor g l vt stands for working volume of the reactor l xw represents vss in effluent g l vw is the withdrawn effluent volume l and tc is the cycle time h granule disintegration increased effluent vss concentration 0 7 0 74 g l in b1 providing 8 days srt after day 49 followed by 14 and 28 days srt values in b2 and b3 respectively as nitrification is a lengthy process and growth of nobs are favoured by longer srts 10 30 days b3 had maximum 14 5 0 02 mg l effluent no3 n concentrations indicating maximum complete nitrification among the three strains 52 b1 and b2 had 0 51 0 04 and 0 78 0 01 mg l of no3 n concentrations in effluent after day 49 in steady state nitrogen consumption in biomass growth was calculated as 45 42 8 and 34 8 mg l in b1 b2 and b3 by using eqn 3 3 nitrogen consumption in biomass growth mg l 0 12 px bio q where px bio is the biomass wasted per day mg vss day which was calculated by eqn 4 51 and q is the flow rate inside b1 b2 and b3 which was 0 5 l day 4 p x bio x v t s r t hence about 60 90 influent nitrogen was consumed in biomass growth leaving 1 02 28 for complete nitrifications and the remaining 4 11 nitrogen provided 5 12 2 2 and 2 mg l effluent nh4 n concentration is b1 b2 and b3 respectively recovery of nitrogen removal and nitrification efficiency in agrs were documented by applying co substrates while treating petroleum wastewater 18 45 in current study granules were fed with hypersaline refinery wastewater as sole substrate that too in higher tph content 330 mg l than previous reports 5 6 250 mg l single strain micrococcus granules could withstand hydrocarbon and salinity exposure due to high eps content 226 mg g vss and granule strength ic 12 providing 96 nh4 n removal and 28 nitrification efficiency without adding co substrates influence of changing nacl salinity in b1 b2 and b3 effluent characteristics are summarized in fig 5 3 6 granular biomass activity study granular biomass activity is the parameter to determine the amount of organic matter present in the system responsible for cod removal 36 the cumulative cod removal profile and the individual biomass activities of b1 b2 and b3 at 35 g l nacl are described in fig 6 the initial flocculent cultures of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus achieved only 0 002 mg cod mg vss day biomass activity value after 50 h of feeding with sodium acetate after salt acclimatization the biomass activity pattern correlated with granule vss content salt tolerance and hydrocarbon removal efficiencies of the batches aerobic granules achieved a stable 71 93 cod removal between 20 35 g l salinity range providing average 0 87 0 03 0 90 0 09 1 22 0 07 mg cod mg vss day of biomass activity values in b1 b2 and b3 respectively above 8 g l vss and 12 ic value ensured maximum biomass activity in b3 similarly in a previous study we observed higher biomass activity in granules having 8 g l vss and 21 ic developed under 12 hrt than agrs operated with longer hrts providing weaker granules 46 3 7 analysis of pollutant removal kinetics day 49 onwards pollutant removals were checked in every 6 h intervals of 24 h cycle tph phenol cresols and nh4 n removal profiles during a batch cycle are illustrated in fig 7 figs s4 s6 supplementary materials provide the hplc data of phenol and cresol concentrations in every 6 h intervals in b1 b2 and b3 b1 b2 and b3 achieved 71 93 cod removal within 12 24 h of batch operation at 25 35 g l nacl exposure tph removal efficiency also varied between 71 5 92 7 in 24 h hplc analysis proved that after 24 h of feeding b1 was capable of removing 70 97 phenol and cresols contributing 381 1 mg l cod and 94 2 mg l tph values in effluent reduced vss 5 3 g l and low biomass activity 0 87 0 03 mg cod mg vss day in brevibacterium granules resulted into no further effluent sample checked on 30th h phenolics degradation in b1 after the 24th hour stable granules of b2 could remove 68 phenol and 70 cresols in 18 h complete phenol and cresol degradation occurred in 24 h but the remaining 59 3 1 mg l effluent tph concentration accounted for the non degraded diesel fractions in b2 hplc peaks for b3 effluent indicated complete removal of phenol o m and p cresol within 12 h b3 had the minimum 24 0 12 mg l effluent tph concentration which is corresponding to its strong microstructure ic 12 and highest biomass activity value 1 22 0 07 mg cod mg vss day among the batches biomass activity fig 6 and hydrocarbon removal rates were supporting the kinetic data trends in b1 b2 and b3 kinetic study evaluated 89 93 and 96 nh4 n removal efficiencies within 24 h providing 5 12 3 8 and 2 mg l of effluent nh4 n concentrations in b1 b2 and b3 respectively the effluent no3 n range varied between 0 51 14 5 mg l suggesting only 1 02 and 1 56 complete nitrification took place in b1 and b2 which improved till 28 in b3 as heterotrrophic o cresol degraders protected aob population in aerobic granules 53 cocci dominance on micrococcus granule partially protected nitryfying bacteria enabling 28 complete nitrifications in petroleum wastewater salinity range was found within 35 37 g l 23 previous studies on aerobic granulation reported stable granulation in the above mentioned salinity range but the hydrocarbon concentration was either lower 151 mg l than refinery wastewater 250 mg l or added with co substrates 22 23 literature are available on agr treatment in higher salinity of 60 g l containing comparatively simpler organic compounds that recalcitrant petroleum oil 15 hence the novelty of the current study lies in rapid granulation of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus strains in multiple hydrocarbon polluted refinery wastewater solving slow granulation faced in mixed inoculum moreover saline stress promoted osmotic pressure to enhance eps synthesis in granules which resisted granule rupture till 35 g l nacl salinity and refinery sludge origin helped micrococcus to achieve most salt tolerant granules to remove 93 tph with improved 28 nitrification in 12 h of batch operation 4 conclusions high salinity and high oil concentrations are the major problems faced while treating refinery wastewater a batch study on biodegradation of hypersaline refinery wastewater having toxic organic pollutants like phenol cresol emulsified diesel and ammonia was carried out using three bacterial strains brevibacterium paucivorans staphylococcus hominis and micrococcus aloeverae granular sludge was developed in 21 25 days with each bacterial strain solving slow granulation hitches without adding new sludge or co substrates brevibacterium had granule disintegration after 20 g l nacl salinity whereas staphylococcus achieved 82 tph removal at 35 g l nacl salinity micrococcus granules tolerated salinity of 35 g l nacl due to refinery sludge origin dense microstructure and maximum eps content in sludge among the three strains providing 93 removal of 330 mg l tph in 70 days it also showed fastest phenol and tph removal kinetics with 28 nitrification in 12 h of batch operation it is observed that granules prepared from micrococcus aloeverae strain may tolerate high salinity 35 g nacl l and capable to degrade organics in high strength refinery

13439,the study demonstrates formation of salt tolerant aerobic granules by using brevibacterium paucivorans staphylococcus hominis and micrococcus aloeverae evaluating organics removal and nitrification efficiencies in refinery wastewater treatment enhanced extracellular polymeric substances eps production during salinity exposure and gradual salt adaptation helped to reduce granule disintegration in all three batches maintaining 71 93 removal of 330 mg l total phenolic hydrocarbon tph after 20 g l salinity exposure brevibacterium faced partial rupture with decreasing size and volatile suspended solids vss of 2 7 2 4 mm and 5 3 g l respectively however at 35 g l salinity the cocci abundance in staphylococcus granules provided moderate stability with 2 5 0 09 mm granule size but micrococcus granules achieved the smallest 0 9 0 02 mm and strongest granules integrity coefficient 12 0 12 due to refinery sludge origin and maximum 226 mg g vss eps content high performance liquid chromatography hplc peaks suggested that micrococcus had the fastest 12 h complete phenolics removal efficiency among the three strains and salt tolerance improved nitrification up to 28 by protecting nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob layers about 330 10 mg l of tph and 35 g nacl l salt tolerance indicated micrococcus granules to be the best fitted inoculum in hypersaline 30 g l salinity refinery wastewater treatment keywords oil degraders single strain granulation refinery wastewater nitrification salt tolerance 1 introduction aerobic granulation has become a popular biotechnology in recalcitrant wastewater treatment for its unique characteristics like granule compactness high settling velocity high biomass retention with microbial diversity possessing pollutant tolerance and degrading properties in adverse condition 1 2 effluent generated from petrochemical leather processing paper and agro based food industries contain high concentration of dissolved inorganic salts 3 wastewater containing 20 and 30 g l salinity are considered as saline and hypersaline wastewater respectively 4 crude oil recovery distillation and alkylation are the major steps in petroleum refining process to produce hypersaline wastewater in aquifer zone saline water is applied to maintain oil reservoir pressure and emulsifier is used for enhanced oil recovery which is a source of wastewater containing emulsified oil total dissolved solids tds nh4 n ammonia nitrogen and salts 5 a mixture of h2s and alkali commonly known as spent caustic is largely used in alkylation step and can increase salinity of refinery effluent up to 300 g l 6 membrane separations like reverse osmosis membrane distillation and pervaporations are the most commonly used techniques for saline wastewater treatment 7 recent advancements in membrane technology introduced composite hollow fiber membranes hybrid nanofiltration reverse osmosis and metal organic frameworks mof integrated membranes for desalination purpose 8 10 however high cost membrane materials membrane fouling maintenance of sophisticated reactors and moreover production of massive volume of refinery wastewater having several oil phenolics salts ammonia and metals are the major challenges of membrane separation for saline oily wastewater 11 biological treatments are considered to be slower stable but economical than physicochemical processes for emulsified oil removal from refinery wastewater however salinity intrusion in reactors having flocculent sludge resulted into osmotic shock which reduced specific oxygen uptake rate sour hampering cell growth rate disrupting enzymatic pathways microbial metabolism and cod chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency 3 aerobic granular reactors agrs were reported to enhance eps production to achieve saline shock resistant granules with high biomass concentration and reduced biomass washout while treating seawater fish canning wastewater or fabricated synthetic wastewater in 2 75 g l salinity range 3 4 12 15 recent advancements in aerobic granulation technology included several strategies like use of halophilic granules of autochthonous seawater microbes to treat saline seawater or stepwise increase in salinity from 0 20 g l in agr at low temperature 16 c for salinity adaptation in granules and application of short term saline shock ranging from 0 60 g l for cultivating salt tolerant granules and providing elevated phenol concentration to achieve about 90 cod removal with improved nitrification and phosphorus removal in low saline wastewater 3 4 15 16 but in hypersaline oily wastewater prolonged granulation period of 30 50 days initial granule rupture and depletion of ammonia oxidising layer reducing nitrogen removal were the major problems faced in agrs 17 18 rapid granulation was carried out by researchers by adding chemical agents like poly aluminium chloride pac and biochar or dry granules in agrs which require chemical use with processing time and cost further indicating necessity of self granulating seed inoculum for rapid granulation in wastewater treatment plants 19 21 agrs were mostly fed with co substrates mixed with oily effluent or in lower hydrocarbon concentration 6 8 151 mg l than real refinery wastewater 250 mg l 17 22 23 moreover nitrogen removal and nitrification are not well explored in dual presence of hydrocarbon recalcitrance and salinity in agrs role of inoculum and microorganism was another important aspect for salt tolerance in aerobic granules literature documented the use of mixed sludge inoculum or salt adapted bio granules and presence of halophilic bacteria like devosia sphingomonas muricauda etc during petroleum slop or phenol o cresol and p nitrophenol contaminated saline wastewater treatment 18 22 23 however rapid granulation from specific bacteria along with salt tolerance nitrification and organics removal in high strength refinery wastewater are not discussed earlier the aim of the study was to conduct batch scale study on rapid aerobic granulation using three bacterial strains named brevibacterium paucivorans strain sg001 staphylococcus hominis strain sg003 and micrococcus aloeverae strain sg002 for treatment of hypersaline refinery wastewater containing phenol cresol and diesel oil and to investigate the impacts of salt tolerance on granule characteristics biomass activity with organics and nitrogen removal efficiency in these three strains to determine their oil and salt tolerance thresholds 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculum sources in our previous study three oil degrading bacterial strains of brevibacterium paucivorans strain sg001 staphylococcus hominis strain sg003 and micrococcus aloeverae strain sg002 were isolated from sewage brewery and refinery sludge granules by streak plate method using nutrient broth and subculturing in emulsified diesel media after genomic dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing bacterial identification was done by constructing phylogenetic tree in neighbor joining method as described in ghosh and chakraborty 24 liquid cultures of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus degraded almost 33 61 oil in 48 h in presence of 320 mg l of emulsified diesel in current study about 3 g l of overnight grown culture of brevibacterium and staphylococcus were inoculated in b1 and b2 batches respectively b3 was inoculated with granulated micrococcus culture grown in a measuring cylinder in 15 days having 0 62 0 2 mm size and 6 72 0 43 g l vss content 2 2 synthetic refinery wastewater a combined refinery wastewater was collected after gravitational separation of heavy oils from indian oil corporation limited iocl refinery guwahati india and was characterized the ph conductivity and turbidity of the refinery wastewater were 7 33 0 1 9 44 ms cm and 62 2 62 8 ntu respectively it contained about 1300 1350 mg l cod having tph concentration of 330 350 mg l phenol o m and p cresol concentrations ranged between 30 50 mg l nh4 n po4 3 so4 4 and cl ions were found in 51 1 250 1 5 100 0 33 and 250 1 mg l concentrations respectively presence of trace amount of heavy metals like fe pb cu cr ni and zn were also detected in the effluent b1 b2 and b3 were fed with synthetic refinery wastewater prepared according to the characteristics of the real wastewater about 330 mg l of tph was provided for 1300 mg l cod and 190 mg l nh4cl was applied for 50 mg l nh4 n in the feed the diesel phenol o m and p cresol concentrations were maintained at 234 50 40 and 30 mg l respectively diesel was emulsified in nonylphenol ethoxylate 200 1 v v ratio about 1 ml l trace metal solution and phosphate buffer were also added to the feed to maintain bacterial growth and feed ph 7 0 2 buffer contained 72 3 g l

nicl2 6h2o nacl concentration was gradually increased between 5 35 g l in the last 49 days the study as salinity of marine water and petroleum slop is reported nearly 35 37 g nacl l we maintained similar salinity range in our feed 23 2 3 batch operating methodology experimental set up is described in fig 1 three 1 l volume measuring cylinders were used to fabricate three batch scale set ups b1 b2 and b3 about 35 cm was the working height with 6 cm inner diameter providing 6 1 height diameter h d ratio of the set ups three aquarium air pumps were employed for providing 2 l min of continuous air flow rate bi b2 and b3 were operated with 1 cycle per day with 48 h hydraulic retention time hrt granule settling time varied between 1 2 min everyday about 500 ml effluent was decanted from an outlet at 17 5 cm height from the base batch feeding and reaction times were 10 and 1418 min respectively the first 21 days was the granulation phase in last 49 days feed salinity was increased from 5 35 g l of nacl concentration in every 7 days interval table 1 provides details of day wise increasing nacl concentration and corresponding conductivity profiles in the batches sterile condition was maintained inside the batches by using sterilized measuring cylinders aeration pipes and wastewater with cotton plugging in b1 and b2 till 21 25 days of matured granulation 25 to maintain real environment non sterile synthetic refinery wastewater was used during salinity exposure 2 4 analytical procedures the salinity and conductivity of the feed and effluent samples were measured by conductivity meter thermo scientific and turbidity was measured by turbidity meter systronics model 132 granule size was analysed by imagej software by measuring equivalent granule diameter from projected average surface area of minimum 50 granules 26 blank studies of hydrocarbon volatilization and adsorption on dead granule surface were checked according to our previous paper 24 cod and nh4 n were measured by closed reflux titrimetric method and phenate method respectively 27 tph was analysed by partition gravimetric method after extracting hydrocarbons in n hexane 27 nitrate nitrogen no3 n and nitrite nitrogen no2 n were analysed by ion chromatograpy 792 basic ic metrohm vss was measured by igniting the sample at 550 c temperature and sludge volume index svi30 was calculated from volume occupied by settled sludge after 30 min of setting time 27 granule settling velocity gsv was measured from the ratio of distance travelled by 10 settling aerobic granules to the average settling time inside a 1 l measuring cylinder 28 eps were heat extracted from the granules 29 proteins pn and polysaccharides ps were analysed according to folin method and phenol sulfuric acid methods respectively 30 31 granule hydrophobicity was determined as the percentage of granules adhering with hydrophobic n hexadecane after 15 min of partitioning absorbance of the sample was measured by spectrophotometer agilent technologies cary 100 singapore at 400 nm wavelength 32 33 integrity coefficient ic of the granules was determined by calculating the ratio of total suspended solids tss present in sample supernatant to the weight tss of the residual granules in terms of percent 34 field emission scanning electron microscope fesem make zeiss model sigma was employed for granule microstructure analysis after glutaraldehyde fixing and dehydrating the sample with ethanol 35 the distribution pattern of proteins polysaccharides total cells and dead cells in granules were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm analysis model leica sp8 tcs germany with lasx confocal software by staining the samples with syto 63 fitc con a and sytox blue dyes and cutting them into 30 μm cross sections to observe under 10 or 20 objectives 28 effluent samples were taken out from the batches in every 6 h intervals till the 24th h for pollutant removal kinetics study biomass activity of the granules was measured by plotting a cumulative cod removal graph till 30 h of feeding in the batches with simple carbon source sodium acetate 36 biomass activity was calculated as mg cod mg vss day by following eqn 1 1 a c t i v i t y m g c o d r e m o v e d m g v s s d a y s l o p e o f g r a p h m g c o d r e m o v e d h 24 h day 1 m g v s s 2 5 high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis phenol and cresols were detected by hplc agilent technologies 1260 infinity ii by using c 18 reverse phase column with uv vis detector at 275 nm wavelength about 40 60 v v of acetonitrile and water mixture was applied at 0 5 ml min flow rate and 27 c temperature as mobile phase standard curves of phenol o cresol m cresol and p cresol were prepared using 99 pure samples procured from himedia phenol o m and p cresol peaks were eluted at 12 5 15 9 and 17 2 min retention times respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 granule formation by brevibacterium and staphylococcus strains rapid granulation occurred in 10 days of inoculation of brevibacterium and staphylococcus in b1 and b2 optimum granule size is considered within 0 2 16 mm of diameter 37 and in current study the initial granule size was nearly 0 2 to 0 3 mm which was within the mentioned range after 21 25 days of batch operation matured yellowish granules were formed having 1 43 0 01 and 1 56 0 05 mm diameter with 4 3 0 01 and 3 47 0 04 g l of biomass concentration vss in b1 and b2 respectively fig 2 describes granule size vss ic settleability and eps profiles during granulation phase in b1 and b2 the oil degrading nature and granular sludge origin of the strains helped to utilize oily wastewater to granulate and grow 24 granule settling behaviour is determined by two parameters gsv and svi30 where gsv is correlated with granule size and svi30 determines volume occupied by settled sludge after 30 min settling time about 30 70 m h of gsv range and below 50 ml g of svi30 are essential for matured granulation 38 39 in 25 days with increasing size and density gsv increased whereas svi30 decreased from 31 to 34 m h and 53 to 47 ml g in b1 and 32 to 35 m h and 41 to 36 ml g in b2 respectively high granule strength determines low integrity coefficient ic of granules 34 about 37 25 0 56 31 9 0 34 ic values indicated initiation of granule structural integrity in brevibacterium and staphylococcus granules eps are the polymers containing proteins pn and polysaccharides ps on outer granule layer enhancing cell surface hydrophobicity for cell aggregation in 21 days of batch operation eps concentration triggered up to 73 0 27 and 84 0 12 mg g vss in b1 and b2 with 74 79 hydrophobicity values suggesting stable aerobic granules treating recalcitrant refinery wastewater literature suggested that matured granulation from mixed inoculums like petrochemical sludge and flocculent municipal activated sludge took minimum 30 50 days while treating recalcitrant petroleum slop or hypesaline oily wastewater 17 18 23 autochthonous seawater microbes took almost 110 days for granular sludge formation in hypersaline seawater 4 however in current study rapid granulation in nearly 20 days from single strain bacteria in complex refinery wastewater determines its feasibility to withstand hydrocarbon recalcitrance in real refinery wastewater treatment plants 3 2 granule characterization in saline refinery wastewater during the salinity influence phase day 26 70 a significant variation in granule characteristics was observed in brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus granules photographs of the aerobic granules taken on day 65 are shown in fig s1 supplementary materials changes in granule size vss ic and comparative svi30 to gsv profiles in b1 b2 and b3 are described in fig 2a d between day 26 42 in presence of 330 mg l tph and 5 15 g l nacl salinity b1 b2 and b3 developed granules with 0 7 2 35 mm size 4 81 7 7 g l vss and 176 178 mg g vss of eps content however after 20 g l nacl exposure brevibacterium granules faced partial disintegration decreasing size and vss from 2 7 2 4 mm and 5 4 g l which gradually increased effluent vss up to 0 74 g l granule rupture eventually decreased gsv and increased svi30 in b1 till 32 m h and 45 ml g respectively ic profile hiked from 27 to 29 in b1 indicating reduction in granule strength day 49 onwards at 25 35 g l nacl salinity b1 acclimatized in hydrocarbon and saline environment achieving stability at 2 15 0 11 mm diameter and 3 0 04 g l vss b2 granules had moderate granule strength ic 21 in presence of 20 35 g l nacl which stabilized at 2 5 0 09 mm granule size and 5 78 0 09 g l vss in 49 days micrococcus had the smallest size 0 9 0 03 mm and strongest granules ic 12 0 12 at 35 g l nacl suggesting the most salt tolerant granules among the batches at 330 mg l tph exposure due to bigger size staphylococcus granules b2 achieved 38 m h gsv but the higher biomass density vss 8 23 0 06 g l and microbial strength ic 12 provided maximum 43 m h gsv in small sized b3 granules 38 low svi30 range 41 28 ml g in b2 and b3 further indicated highly settleable granules 39 mixed inoculum promoted 70 80 m h of gsv and about 30 ml g of svi5 in aerobic granules treating hypersaline oily wastewater containing 5 6 mg l oil 17 and stepwise increase in salinity till 38 g nacl l provided stable aerobic granules with 20 ml g svi5 and svi30 values in 164 days 40 hence current study indicates the feasibility of using single strains of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus to achieve faster stronger and more stable granulation than the previous studies while treating hypersaline refinery wastewater 3 3 extracellular polymeric substances comparative eps with pn and hydrophobicity trends in b1 b2 and b3 are illustrated in fig 2e f in b1 oil toxicity and saline shock initially reduced eps and pn synthesis between 177 170 and 129 117 mg g vss salt adaptation gradually stabilized eps content at 168 0 33 mg g vss with 79 hydrophobicity in brevibacterium granules at 35 g l nacl salinity till day 70 b2 granules reached stable eps and pn concentrations at 210 0 22 and 169 1 mg g vss providing 84 hydrophobicity the mechanism behind granule formation and stability in hypersaline refinery wastewater might be the inherited oil tolerance from refinery sludge origin which provided high biomass content to form micrococcus granules and the saline shock in feed which promoted osmotic pressure increasing microbial activity for eps synthesis in granules 41 eps are the base materials to increase cell to cell adhesion for granule formation and stability 42 according to literature bigger granules in b1 and b2 might be a possible reason of lower eps content than smaller granules in b3 under salinity influence 15 hence salinity stress promoted 226 mg g vss of eps layer with 91 hydrophobicity in micrococcus granules which acted as a shield to resist granule rupture during petroleum slop wastewater treatment pn ps values were found near 9 at 11 24 g l of salinity which deteriorated to a ratio of 3 4 resulting into partial degranulation at 37 g l salinity 23 in current study even in presence of hypersalinity 35 g nacl l and high hydrocarbon concentration 330 mg l pn ps trend was observed between 4 5 9 5 in b2 and b3 suggesting granule robustness and structural stability with higher proportion of bound proteins according to sivasubramanian et al 43 higher na ion concentration might have associated with promoting protein synthesis enzymes in micrococcus and staphylococcus granules but saline exposure increased the hydrophilic polysaccharides production in brevibacterium which reduced pn ps ratio up to 2 causing granule rupture hampering granule settleability table 2 provides a comparison between two scenarios mixed sludge inoculated aerobic granules treating saline wastewater and specific strain originated aerobic granules treating refinery wastewater in dual presence of hydrocarbon recalcitrance and saline stress the table showed that the previous studies focused on saline water treatment 0 38 g l salinity mostly added with co substrates with or without presence of recalcitrant organic pollutants where salt adapted or mixed sludge inoculated aerobic granules were used in agrs dominance of halophilic bacteria was also evident in aerobic granules in contrast current study indicated utility of single strain inoculum for rapid formation of salt tolerant granules by using refinery wastewater as sole substrate with 330 mg l tph concentration and about 35 g nacl l salinity providing 93 organics removal and improved nitrification than earlier studies 3 4 microscopic image analysis fig s2 supplementary materials provides fesem images of b1 b2 and b3 granules taken on day 65 at 5000 magnification non filamentous microstructure with rod shaped bacterial population suggested that after initial rupture brevibacteriam b1 granules acclimatized in saline environment achieving denser granules cocci abundance on staphylococcus and micrococcus granule surfaces ensured strong microbial structure in b2 and b3 which is further justified by their high vss 5 8 g l content and low ic values 12 21 clsm analysis was conducted on day 65 of the study fig s3 supplementary materials extended fluorescence of syto 63 indicated high amount of total cells in b1 b2 and b3 granules high fitc fluorescence in b3 further signified maximum protein content in micrococcus granules among the three strains con a fluorescence was comparatively higher in brevibacterium as polysaccharides content increased in saline environment decreasing pn ps ratio between 2 4 in b1 higher sytox blue fluorescence in b1 suggested more number of dead cells in brevibacterium granules than b2 and b3 due to granule rupture in saline shock 3 5 performances of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus granules 3 5 1 organics removal performances the cod tph phenol o m p cresol and emulsified diesel removal profiles are described in fig 3 the influent cod and tph concentrations were constant at 1300 mg l and 330 mg l providing 0 95 kg cod m3 day of organic loading rate olr and 0 495 kg m3 day of hydrocarbon loading rate hlr throughout 70 days of the study emulsified diesel phenol o m and p cresol feeding were maintained at 234 50 40 30 and 30 mg l concentrations respectively previously brevibacterium paucivorans and staphylococcus hominis cultures were observed to degrade 33 28 0 84 and 38 18 0 90 tph after 48 h of inoculation in oily wastewater having 320 mg l influent tph concentration 24 in current study brevibacterium b1 and staphylococcus b2 achieved almost 73 75 cod and tph removal in granulation phase day 1 25 confirming granulated strains were more hydrocarbon tolerant and efficient in organics removal than their liquid culture after 20 g l nacl exposure partial granule rupture and vss reduction dropped tph removal from 75 to 70 in b1 in last 20 days at 25 35 g l nacl b1 reached nearly stable 70 71 cod and tph removal due to stable vss and eps concentration after 70 days of complete batch operation b1 provided 15 5 40 48 0 75 5 44 mg l of effluent phenol oil and cresol concentrations respectively till day 49 b2 had 80 81 cod and tph removals staphylococcus granules achieved stability at 20 35 g l nacl providing 82 and 95 97 of tph and phenolics removal respectively the cocci dominated strong granules with 5 77 g l vss ensured salt tolerance with 80 9 cod removal from refinery wastewater in b2 the final oil phenol and cresol concentrations in b2 effluent were 40 38 5 35 and 0 9 5 44 mg l respectively the smallest strongest micrococcus granules with maximum 8 34 g l vss concentration ensured maximum 92 2 cod and 92 7 tph removal in b3 between day 26 49 it remained stable at 92 8 tph removal up to 35 g l nacl till day 70 indicating the most salt tolerant oil degrading granules among the three strains almost complete phenolics and 89 7 diesel removal were achieved in b3 on day 70 the hydrocarbon degradation rates were calculated as 14 9 0 32 25 78 0 12 and 46 34 0 45 mg oil g vss day in b1 b2 and b3 respectively the stable hydrocarbon removal in b1 b2 and b3 even in salinity stress can be explained in two ways salinity increases water density causing loose biomass washout from reactors whereas bigger and denser granular sludge with good settling property remain inside the reactor 22 the high biomass concentration determines high microbial activity degrading recalcitrant diesel oil phenol and cresol compounds by aerobic granules the another possible reason might be the combined impact of salinity stress and osmotic pressure enhanced eps synthesis and conversion of hydrocarbons into proteins during feast phase of the batch operation nearly 12 h of cycle discussed in section 3 7 the proteins are utilized in famine phase increasing cell surface hydrophobicity of the granules the eps layer works as a barrier between cell wall and external environment and protects the granules from harsh saline exposure 40 refinery wastewater treatment plants often suffer from two problems high oil concentration above 250 mg l and high salinity 35 37 g l nacl 23 44 hydrocarbon recalcitrance and saline stress causes biomass washout from biological treatment plants and chemical treatments involve use of costly chemicals and technologies which are not economically and environmentally viable 3 in current study aerobic granulation from brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus strains in hypersaline refinery wastewater solved the granule rupture and slow granulation faced in mixed inoculum and granules were capable of degrading oil phenol and cresols with nitrification within a threshold limit of salt and hydrocarbon concentration the study reflected its practical applicability in refinery effluent treatment plants by using micrococcus granules at 0 9 0 95 kg cod m3 day of olr range for simultaneous 93 hydrocarbon removal and 28 nitrification at 330 10 mg l hydrocarbon and 35 g nacl l salinity tolerance thresholds respectively corsino et al 17 and campo and di bella 23 observed that in salinity influence eps production enhanced physical bio adsorption of oil in granules while treating petroleum wastewater in current study volatilization and adsorption study confirmed that only 1 2 tph was removed abiotically or by adsorption on dead granule surface indicating that organics were removed by biodegradation in granules 24 corsino et al 17 observed 90 hydrocarbon removal by aerobic granules in hypersaline oily wastewater where tph concentration was only 5 6 mg l zhang et al 45 suggested co metabolism degradation mechanism where oil and sodium acetate were simultaneously degraded in the agr in another study ramos et al 22 achieved complete phenolics removal in agr treatment of aromatic wastewater having phenol o cresol and p nitrophenol where glucose and sucrose were simultaneously fed as co substrates moreover they faced complete granule disintegration at 29 g l salinity which was reconstructed after adding anaerobic granules in contrast in current study recalcitrant diesel and phenolics were used as sole carbon source for granules that too with higher tph content 330 mg l than previous literature which achieved stability between 25 35 g l salinity providing 71 93 organics removal without adding new sludge or substrate degradation of diesel oil having c6 c36 carbons has been studied in our previous work which followed a pathway where n alkane was converted to alcohol further sequentially oxidized into aldehydes and then into fatty acids such as tridecanoic acid c13 or octadecanoic acid c18 46 the fatty acids were observed to take part in β oxidation providing cell metabolic energy 47 aerobic degradation of phenolic compounds can be predicted to follow the phenol to catechol conversion pathway as previously observed in agrs treating o cresol by basheer and farooqi 48 catechol degradation is subdivided into ortho and meta pathways ortho pathway converts catechol into cis cis muconate which is utilized in tca cycle meta pathway can cleave the catechol ring to produce 2 hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hmsa which is further oxidized into muconolactone literature evidences of halophile dominance like autochthonous halophilic bacteria and other strains like devosia sphingomonas muricauda stappiaceae rhodobacteraceae halomonas nitzschia etc in granules helped in either eps synthesis of aromatic compound degradation to achieve stability between 2 60 g l salt stress in sea water and aromatic saline wastewater treatment 4 13 22 49 b1 b2 and b3 followed similar organics removal trends as observed in sewage brewery and refinery sludge granules origin of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus strains discussed in our previous paper 24 hence the refinery sludge origin oil adaptation and high eps content were the key factors to resist salinity inhibition for maximum hydrocarbon removal efficiency in micrococcus granules which can be further best fitted in agr scale treatment of hypersaline above 30 g nacl l salinity refinery wastewater 3 5 2 nitrogen removal performance nitrogen loading rate was 0 075 kg nh4 n m3 day nh4 n removal patterns and variations in effluent no3 n and no2 n concentrations are described in fig 4 in granulation phase day1 25 b1 and b2 had 92 94 nh4 n removals which further increseased upto 93 and 95 in 15 g l nacl exposure with no granule rapture however after day 49 nh4 n removal dropped to 89 in b1 due to partial rupture in 20 g nacl l salinity poor nh4 n removal was previously reported in agrs treating real petroleum wastewater 18 45 as nitrifying bacterial growth in outer aerobic granule layer can be restricted by hydrocarbon toxicity in salinity exposure 50 finally after saline stress adaptation b1 maintained stability with 89 nh4 n removal between 25 35 g l salinity influene b2 had stable 95 6 nh4 n removal till day 70 at 25 35 g l salinity influence due to less granule rapture and high vss values micrococcus granules in b3 had 95 nh4 n removal capacity which followed stable removal pattern in 5 20 g l of nacl concentration the previous oil adaptation strong microbial integrity ic 12 and highest vss concentration 8 34 g l promoted 96 nh4 n removal in b3 in further salinity of 25 35 g l nacl till day 70 during nitrification nh4 is initially converted to no2 by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and further tranformed to no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob ion chromatography results provided negligible amount of effluent no2 n concentrations 0 01 0 02 mg l indicating almost absence of partial nitrification in the batches sludge retention time srt determines the mean retention time activated sludge solid retain in a wastewater treatment plant which is calculated according to eqn 2 51 2 s r t d a y x v t x w v w t c where x is the vss inside the reactor g l vt stands for working volume of the reactor l xw represents vss in effluent g l vw is the withdrawn effluent volume l and tc is the cycle time h granule disintegration increased effluent vss concentration 0 7 0 74 g l in b1 providing 8 days srt after day 49 followed by 14 and 28 days srt values in b2 and b3 respectively as nitrification is a lengthy process and growth of nobs are favoured by longer srts 10 30 days b3 had maximum 14 5 0 02 mg l effluent no3 n concentrations indicating maximum complete nitrification among the three strains 52 b1 and b2 had 0 51 0 04 and 0 78 0 01 mg l of no3 n concentrations in effluent after day 49 in steady state nitrogen consumption in biomass growth was calculated as 45 42 8 and 34 8 mg l in b1 b2 and b3 by using eqn 3 3 nitrogen consumption in biomass growth mg l 0 12 px bio q where px bio is the biomass wasted per day mg vss day which was calculated by eqn 4 51 and q is the flow rate inside b1 b2 and b3 which was 0 5 l day 4 p x bio x v t s r t hence about 60 90 influent nitrogen was consumed in biomass growth leaving 1 02 28 for complete nitrifications and the remaining 4 11 nitrogen provided 5 12 2 2 and 2 mg l effluent nh4 n concentration is b1 b2 and b3 respectively recovery of nitrogen removal and nitrification efficiency in agrs were documented by applying co substrates while treating petroleum wastewater 18 45 in current study granules were fed with hypersaline refinery wastewater as sole substrate that too in higher tph content 330 mg l than previous reports 5 6 250 mg l single strain micrococcus granules could withstand hydrocarbon and salinity exposure due to high eps content 226 mg g vss and granule strength ic 12 providing 96 nh4 n removal and 28 nitrification efficiency without adding co substrates influence of changing nacl salinity in b1 b2 and b3 effluent characteristics are summarized in fig 5 3 6 granular biomass activity study granular biomass activity is the parameter to determine the amount of organic matter present in the system responsible for cod removal 36 the cumulative cod removal profile and the individual biomass activities of b1 b2 and b3 at 35 g l nacl are described in fig 6 the initial flocculent cultures of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus achieved only 0 002 mg cod mg vss day biomass activity value after 50 h of feeding with sodium acetate after salt acclimatization the biomass activity pattern correlated with granule vss content salt tolerance and hydrocarbon removal efficiencies of the batches aerobic granules achieved a stable 71 93 cod removal between 20 35 g l salinity range providing average 0 87 0 03 0 90 0 09 1 22 0 07 mg cod mg vss day of biomass activity values in b1 b2 and b3 respectively above 8 g l vss and 12 ic value ensured maximum biomass activity in b3 similarly in a previous study we observed higher biomass activity in granules having 8 g l vss and 21 ic developed under 12 hrt than agrs operated with longer hrts providing weaker granules 46 3 7 analysis of pollutant removal kinetics day 49 onwards pollutant removals were checked in every 6 h intervals of 24 h cycle tph phenol cresols and nh4 n removal profiles during a batch cycle are illustrated in fig 7 figs s4 s6 supplementary materials provide the hplc data of phenol and cresol concentrations in every 6 h intervals in b1 b2 and b3 b1 b2 and b3 achieved 71 93 cod removal within 12 24 h of batch operation at 25 35 g l nacl exposure tph removal efficiency also varied between 71 5 92 7 in 24 h hplc analysis proved that after 24 h of feeding b1 was capable of removing 70 97 phenol and cresols contributing 381 1 mg l cod and 94 2 mg l tph values in effluent reduced vss 5 3 g l and low biomass activity 0 87 0 03 mg cod mg vss day in brevibacterium granules resulted into no further effluent sample checked on 30th h phenolics degradation in b1 after the 24th hour stable granules of b2 could remove 68 phenol and 70 cresols in 18 h complete phenol and cresol degradation occurred in 24 h but the remaining 59 3 1 mg l effluent tph concentration accounted for the non degraded diesel fractions in b2 hplc peaks for b3 effluent indicated complete removal of phenol o m and p cresol within 12 h b3 had the minimum 24 0 12 mg l effluent tph concentration which is corresponding to its strong microstructure ic 12 and highest biomass activity value 1 22 0 07 mg cod mg vss day among the batches biomass activity fig 6 and hydrocarbon removal rates were supporting the kinetic data trends in b1 b2 and b3 kinetic study evaluated 89 93 and 96 nh4 n removal efficiencies within 24 h providing 5 12 3 8 and 2 mg l of effluent nh4 n concentrations in b1 b2 and b3 respectively the effluent no3 n range varied between 0 51 14 5 mg l suggesting only 1 02 and 1 56 complete nitrification took place in b1 and b2 which improved till 28 in b3 as heterotrrophic o cresol degraders protected aob population in aerobic granules 53 cocci dominance on micrococcus granule partially protected nitryfying bacteria enabling 28 complete nitrifications in petroleum wastewater salinity range was found within 35 37 g l 23 previous studies on aerobic granulation reported stable granulation in the above mentioned salinity range but the hydrocarbon concentration was either lower 151 mg l than refinery wastewater 250 mg l or added with co substrates 22 23 literature are available on agr treatment in higher salinity of 60 g l containing comparatively simpler organic compounds that recalcitrant petroleum oil 15 hence the novelty of the current study lies in rapid granulation of brevibacterium staphylococcus and micrococcus strains in multiple hydrocarbon polluted refinery wastewater solving slow granulation faced in mixed inoculum moreover saline stress promoted osmotic pressure to enhance eps synthesis in granules which resisted granule rupture till 35 g l nacl salinity and refinery sludge origin helped micrococcus to achieve most salt tolerant granules to remove 93 tph with improved 28 nitrification in 12 h of batch operation 4 conclusions high salinity and high oil concentrations are the major problems faced while treating refinery wastewater a batch study on biodegradation of hypersaline refinery wastewater having toxic organic pollutants like phenol cresol emulsified diesel and ammonia was carried out using three bacterial strains brevibacterium paucivorans staphylococcus hominis and micrococcus aloeverae granular sludge was developed in 21 25 days with each bacterial strain solving slow granulation hitches without adding new sludge or co substrates brevibacterium had granule disintegration after 20 g l nacl salinity whereas staphylococcus achieved 82 tph removal at 35 g l nacl salinity micrococcus granules tolerated salinity of 35 g l nacl due to refinery sludge origin dense microstructure and maximum eps content in sludge among the three strains providing 93 removal of 330 mg l tph in 70 days it also showed fastest phenol and tph removal kinetics with 28 nitrification in 12 h of batch operation it is observed that granules prepared from micrococcus aloeverae strain may tolerate high salinity 35 g nacl l and capable to degrade organics in high strength refinery
