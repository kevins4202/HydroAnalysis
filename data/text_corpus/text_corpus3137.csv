15685,wastewater based epidemiology wbe has potential to identify the epidemiological links between people animals and the environment as part of antimicrobial resistance amr surveillance in this study we investigated six wastewater treatment plants wwtps serving six communities located in two regions in eastern china site a in zhejiang and site b in jiangsu province to assess the public use of antimicrobial agents aa fifty antimicrobials and 24 of their metabolites were quantified using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms spatiotemporal trends were established for measured concentrations daily loads and population normalised daily loads daily aa mass loads varied between 1 6 g day and 324 6 g day reflecting the wwtp scales with macrolides and β lactams showing the highest overall environmental burden at 223 7 g day and 173 7 g day respectively emissions of antibiotic residues from manufacturing have been observed with the peak daily load 12 fold higher than the overall load from a community serving a population of over 600 000 community exposure levels of 225 2 156 2 mg day 1000 inhabitant and 351 9 133 5 mg day 1000 inhabitant were recorded in site a and b respectively paired parent metabolites analysis identified a large proportion 64 78 of un metabolised metronidazole and clindamycin at site b indicating improper disposal of unused drugs either in the community or in livestock production consumption levels calculated via wbe suggested relatively low antimicrobial usage in eastern china compared to other areas in china this first application of wbe in eastern china to assess the community wide exposure to aas has potential to inform regional antimicrobial stewardship graphical

introduction antimicrobial resistance amr has been identified by the world health organisation who as one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity a recent comprehensive study of the global burden of amr reported an estimated 4 95 million deaths associated with bacterial amr in 2019 murray et al 2022 in addition the covid 19 pandemic has also caused an unforeseen impact on amr particularly in developing countries ghosh et al 2021 this is partially due to the widespread use of antibiotics to treat covid 19 patients regardless of severity of illness in the first phase of the pandemic cong et al 2021 while global and coordinated action plans are required in order to address the spread of amr the lack of surveillance data in many locations is one of the major challenges in need of resolution murray et al 2022 compared to the traditional clinical surveillance systems a wastewater based approach could be a promising tool especially for low and middle income countries because of lower resource demand larsson and flach 2021 wastewater based epidemiology wbe is a new epidemiology approach that can be applied for environmental surveillance of amr to identify epidemiological links between humans animals and the environment sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 wastewater represents a complex matrix containing a wide range of chemical and biological markers including city stressors e g toxicants and infectious agents and physiological processes e g specific disease linked proteins antibiotic resistance genes and metabolites choi et al 2018 kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a some recent studies have successfully applied wbe to investigate amr status both regionally and nationally for example quinolones and quinolone resistance gene loads have been monitored in wastewaters across seven european countries castrignanò et al 2020b antibiotic use has been estimated during a flu season in eight densely populated areas in beijing china zhang et al 2019 wbe combined with local prescription data has been applied in southwest england to quantify antimicrobials usage holton et al 2022b parent compounds active antimicrobial agents aas are usually selected as biomarkers however the inclusion of aa metabolites in wbe analyses adds a further dimension to amr exposure assessment the ratios between parent drugs and their corresponding metabolites in wastewater can also be used to verify aa consumption levels and direct disposal of unused hence unmetabolised drugs kasprzyk hordern et al 2021b in the context of an ecological risk assessment metabolites can be found at high concentrations with high toxicity mobility and persistence in the environment singh et al 2021 it is therefore advisable to include key metabolites where possible to fully understand the overall environmental burden of antibiotics for example the human metabolite sulfoxide clindamycin has been detected in influent samples to obtain accurate estimates of clindamycin input loads ávila et al 2021 marx et al 2015 oertel et al 2014 recent studies in china have shown the potential to use sulfonamide quinolone and macrolide parent drugs and metabolites to estimate the nationwide consumption level gao et al 2022 han et al 2022 there are several considerations for the application of wbe to assess community wide exposure to antimicrobials firstly in order to capture the dynamics of wastewater a flow or time proportional sampling strategy should be adopted secondly daily flow rates of influent are essential to convert the measured concentration into daily mass loads thirdly the population size in the wwtp catchment is key to allowing direct comparison between different communities finally the in sewer stability and in sample stability of the selected biomarkers should be considered for instance longer sewer residence times could lead to degradation transformation of oxidative stress biomarkers gracia lor et al 2017 o brien et al 2019 to date a few studies have reported mass loads of aas per capita in wwtps in china gao et al 2022 han et al 2022 wang et al 2018 yuan et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 two of which have included metabolite biomarkers in the consumption estimation due to dense populations an intensive livestock production industry and extensive antibiotic use eastern china has been identified as a hotspot for amr cai et al 2022b two economically and epidemiologically distinct residential areas zhejiang province site a and jiangsu province site b located in eastern china were selected in the present study the study sites were selected to facilitate the use of existing epidemiology study cohorts to explore the potential long term effects of antibiotic use and exposure to environmental antibiotic residues seventy four aas including both parent aas and their metabolites were monitored in the surveyed communities in two sampling campaigns accounting for different seasons the aim of this study is to assess the spatiotemporal community wide public exposure to aas public intake vs total environmental burden using a wbe approach this has potential to inform antimicrobial stewardship interventions in the local area 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials a total of 50 aas and 24 major metabolites were targeted in the present study the selected aas covered a wide range of antibiotic classes including β lactams sulfonamides and trimethoprim macrolides and lincomycin quinolones azoles phenicols cyclines nitrofurans and tuberculosis tb drugs two antiretrovirals emtricitabine and lamivudine were included due to their significant association with tb and hiv coinfection a total of 21 stable isotope labelled internal standards istd were used for the quantification of the target compounds a

coverage and population size are provided in table s1 population size population equivalent pe served by selected wwtps was estimated using local census data wwtp 5 region b is an exception where ammonia parameters were used to estimate pe table s2 zhang et al 2019 two sampling campaigns were carried out over 7 consecutive days in august 2020 and january 2021 respectively which are considered as wet and dry seasons in the study areas wwtp 1 3 are grouped as as summer and aw winter in site a while wwtp 4 6 are grouped as bs summer and bw winter in site b in order to obtain a representative influent sample a flow proportional composite sampling strategy was adopted by using an auto sampler jh 8000d qingdao to collect 10 ml of the influents at regular 15 min time intervals for 24 h on the day of collection 50 ml of the composite wastewater samples were spiked in duplicate with 50 ng of an internal standard mixture 50 μl of 1 mg l mix samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and frozen 20 ⁰c for shipment to the uk and processing 2 3 sample preparation and analysis solid phase extraction spe was conducted at fudan university using sample preparation protocol developed by holton and kasprzyk hordern 2021 briefly 50 ml of samples were filtered through a gf f glass fibre filter 0 7 μm whatman and the filtrates were loaded under vacuum onto pre conditioned oasis hlb cartridges 60 mg waters uk at 5 0 ml min the cartridges were conditioned and equilibrated with 2 ml of meoh followed by 2 ml of hplc water under gravity after loading cartridges were dried under vacuum sealed with parafilm and stored at 20 ⁰c freezer until being shipped on dry ice to the university of bath once received analytes were eluted using 4 ml meoh under gravity and the eluate was collected in silanised vials thermo scientific uk to prevent the analytes and internal standards from adsorbing onto the glass surface after elution extracted samples were evaporated to dryness at 40

informatics uk a custom excel template was used for data processing and validation assessment holton and kasprzyk hordern 2021 originpro 2019 was used to draw histogram and line graphs mean and standard deviation calculations were performed with microsoft excel 2016 one way analysis of variance anova pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis pca were performed using originpro 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection frequency classification and distribution of antimicrobials a total of 39 out of 74 aas were detected in all samples both mixed type wastewater and domestic wastewater showed similar detection frequencies 73 and industrial wastewater showed a lower detection frequency 14 overall detection frequency and concentration range for each aa in the sampling sites excluding industrial wastewater are shown in fig 1 in general macrolides and sulfonamides showed the highest detection frequencies followed by quinolones and other aas β lactams were found at the lowest detection frequencies 20 40 in influent samples from all wwtps the majority of analytes recorded a concentration range between 10 and 100 ng l in the influents with site a showed a slightly lower mean value at 44 0 55 3 ng l than site b 63 9 116 0 ng l highest concentration range 500 ng l was seen for ceftriaxone and roxithromycin and the latter varied the most in the two sites numbers of aas detected daily are provided in fig s2 according to the who aware access watch and reserve metrics access group antibiotics 9 in total accounted for 11 5 52 5 of all antibiotics detected while watch group antibiotics 11 in total accounted for 46 9 88 5 fig s3 a target indicator proposed by who specifies a country level target of at least 60 of overall antibiotic consumption from the access group who 2021 higher percentage of the watch group observed is mainly due to the contribution of quinolones and macrolides indicating that these drugs need to be prioritised for antibiotic stewardship table s3 shows the differences in ab classification in the study areas the levels calculated in wastewaters are commensurate with hospital antibiotic use in china hsia et al 2019 for instance who watch group antibiotics accounted for up to 82 2 of all antibiotic therapies in children wang et al 2020 proportional abundances for each drug class across all sites seasons are provided in fig s4 3 2 overall spatial temporal trends for concentrations daily mass loads and pndls spatiotemporal week averaged antibiotic by drug class concentrations daily mass loads and population normalised daily loads are presented in fig 2 industrial wastewater wwtp 6 showed the highest overall concentration as a result of drug manufacturing mainly due to the contribution of sulfonamide and amphenicol seasonal increases in winter were seen for all domestic associated wastewater among which wwtp 5 in site b increased the most 220 flow rate varied considerably according to the capacity of each wwtp ranging from 2 4 106 l day in bw5 to 1 4 108 l day in bs4 fig s5 overall daily mass loads varied between 1 6 g day and 324 6 g day as a result of changing flows fig 2 spatiotemporal trends of pndls are presented in fig 2 site b showed a higher community exposure level 351 9 133 5 mg day 1000 inh than site a 225 2 156 2 mg day 1000 inh higher mass loads at 672 182 mg day 1000 inh have been reported in guangdong south china zhou et al 2013 and at 630 42 mg day 1000 inh in wuxi city east china yuan et al 2015 wwtp 4 in site b which served the largest population in the area and represented the most complex influent compositions recorded the highest pndls at 422 6 126 5 mg day 1000 inh compared to other wwtps correlation analysis on the population size with overall concentration and daily load is shown in fig 3 a antibiotic residue levels and daily mass loads were driven by community size as evidenced by the strong and significant positive correlations pearson s r 0 95 p 0 05 between these parameters this observation is consistent with previous studies elder et al 2021 kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a correlation analysis on the weekly average was performed to explore the potential of co prescribing patterns metronidazole cefalexin clindamycin and clarithromycin as well as their metabolites showed significant correlations p 0 05 with more than 35 of all analytes indicating their popularities as broad spectrum antibiotics for co prescribing with other drug classes fig 3b table s4 3 3 drug class observations spatiotemporal trends have been subdivided by drug classes for the following data interpretation fig 4 results classified by wwtps are provided in supplementary material fig s6 3 3 1 quinolones and their metabolic consumption markers nine out of 19 quinolones including metabolites were detected in influents across all sampling sites among which ofloxacin showed the highest abundance in both sites influent ofloxacin concentration exceeding predicted no effect concentration pnec derived from minimal inhibitory concentration mic data at 500 ng l bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 was observed in as1 fig s6 with daily loads increasing accordingly from 5 4 g day to 15 7 and 17 9 g day this indicates that quinolone resistance could potentially be selected for in sewer and across the wastewater treatment process especially when activated sludge or sequencing batch reactor treatment is adopted castrignanò et al 2020a norfloxacin is the second prevalent quinolone in wastewater influent detected in all domestic associated wws average daily loads of norfloxacin ranged from 20 1 mg day in aw3 to 3 9 1 5 g day in bw4 no noticeable seasonality was observed for either ofloxacin p value 0 46 or norfloxacin p value 0 78 lomefloxacin showed a lower overall detection frequency at 48 among which 30 was quantifiable regardless of the relatively low detection frequency lomefloxacin presented consistently in all bw5 samples with an average influent concentration at 37 3 24 4 ng l fig s6 this level is 19 fold higher than the average value 2 0 1 2 ng l from other influent samples the use of lomefloxacin norfloxacin and ofloxacin has been banned in food producing animals in china since 2016 maprc 2015 as a reserve group antibiotic that should be treated as a last line option the high level of lomefloxacin in bw5 may indicate an overuse or misuse of this drug in the community gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were only sporadically detected across the sampling sites and not present in pure domestic wws gatifloxacin was found only in summer samples at 3 7 1 1 ng l while moxifloxacin showed a higher detection frequency at 15 and was present in both seasons moxifloxacin drug production in site b may have also contributed to its presence in the influent in contrast a lower concentration range between 0 6 and 6 7 ng l has been reported in european wws castrignanò et al 2020b enrofloxacin a veterinary antibiotic was found consistently in 57 30 quantifiable of all samples daily influent concentration ranged between 0 25 ng l and 93 7 9 7 ng l in bs4 as expected wwtp 4 in site b represented the highest environmental enrofloxacin residues presumably due to the contribution from veterinary settings such as pig chicken and sheep farming notably enrofloxacin was the most frequently detected veterinary antibiotic in manure based fertilizers in the sample region qian et al 2016 ciprofloxacin is an access group human antibiotic but is also preferred as veterinary medicine in china this drug was present in 64 29 quantifiable of all samples enrofloxacin is metabolised to a large extent into active ciprofloxacin in most species trouchon and lefebvre 2016 a ratio between ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin at 0 34 was reported in animals rao et al 2002 which is comparable with the ratio observed at 0 38 0 19 in bs4 higher ratios at 0 81 0 25 and 8 6 5 3 were recorded in bw4 and bw5 suggesting that high prevalence of ciprofloxacin in winter samples originated from human consumption direct disposal as well as its formation as a metabolite of enrofloxacin ofloxacin n oxide was detected largely below the quantification limit therefore has been excluded for parent metabolite analysis ofx dmofx ratio ofloxacin desmethyl ofloxacin varied considerably across sampling sites and seasons fig s7 ranging from 8 8 5 3 in bs5 to 57 3 29 4 in as1 this is not uncommon for a high ofx dmofx ratio as the median human excretion rate urine and faeces of dmofx is 3 56 holton et al 2022b a case study of wastewater from a hospital inpatient department reported at least one magnitude lower level of metabolite compared to ofloxacin cai et al 2022a wwtp 1 in site a recorded the highest ofx dmofx ratios in both seasons fig s7 likely due to the contribution from the production of ofloxacin eye drops in this site 3 3 2 sulfonamides trimethoprim and their metabolic consumption markers sulfonamide antibiotics and their metabolites were detected consistently across all sampling sites as sulfapyridine is not licensed in china as human or veterinary medicine the presence of this drug is only considered as an active metabolite of human anti inflammatory sulfasalazine liu et al 2017 yang et al 2011 for industrial wastewater wwtp 6 in site b fig s6 trimethoprim and sulfadiazine are the two predominant drugs present in both seasons trimethoprim was detected as high as up to 8 6 0 4 μg l in bs6 nearly 350 fold higher than the average concentration of trimethoprim 24 5 14 3 ng l in domestic associated wws it should be noted that the concentration level reached the estimated upper boundary for the minimal selective concentration for trimethoprim resistant bacteria bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 sulfadiazine was also found at 2 62 0 27 μg l on the same day 830 fold higher than the average concentration found mql to 9 8 ng l in other types of wws this highlights the importance of acknowledging pharmaceutical factories as potential major contributors of antibiotics entering the environment interestingly a strong positive correlation pearson s r 0 94 p 1 0 10 5 was found between trimethoprim and sulfadiazine in industrial wastewater indicating the potential concurrent mass production of these two drugs in local manufacturing plants both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim showed seasonality and the daily load of the latter increased significantly p 0 05 in winter as sulfonamides are generally thermally stable holton et al 2022a usage patterns may correspond to disease seasonality co prescribing patterns were observed for sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim as co trimoxazole as evidenced by the significant positive correlations pearson s r 0 70 and 0 53 in site a and b respectively p 0 004 between the two drugs results showed a ratio of 2 4 1 2 for smx tmp in wastewater containing domestic sewage the value is within the range between 1 1 and 3 3 for the theoretical ratio of smx tmp in raw wastewater indicating that human consumption excretion of co trimoxazole is the main origin for the presence of these two drugs in the study areas thiebault 2020 sulfadiazine showed the lowest detection frequency 64 compared to other sulfonamides average daily influent concentrations of sulfapyridine ranged from 18 0 7 9 ng l bw5 to 96 8 21 0 ng l bs4 much lower levels of sulfapyridine have been reported in previous case studies where this drug was either not detectable or present at very low concentrations ranging between 0 4 and 2 2 ng l in wastewater influents chen et al 2015 hanna et al 2018 these variations reflect the regional difference in the usage patterns of sulfasalazine smx asmx n acetyl smx and spy aspy n acetyl spy are discussed here to verify consumption levels vs direct disposal of unused drugs sulfadiazine and its metabolite were only present sporadically and have been excluded for paired parent metabolite analysis in general both smx asmx and spy aspy showed consistent ratios across the sampling sites fig s7 ranging from 0 5 to 1 2 and from 1 1 to 2 4 respectively this is somewhat expected as the acetyl metabolites of sulfonamides are excreted as a large proportion of the drug 22 40 where parent compounds excreted at a relatively lower portion 15 37 holton et al 2022b no seasonal patterns were observed for the ratios regardless of a higher antibiotic consumption in winter indicating rational uses of these drugs in the area 3 3 3 macrolides lincomycin and their metabolic consumption markers distinctive clindamycin usage patterns were found in the two sites significant seasonal increases in winter were seen in site a p value 0 001 0 01 0 05 for wwtp 1 2 and 3 respectively while no such trends were observed in site b concentration of clindamycin in domestic wastewater in site b were recorded at 5 8 3 0 ng l in nanjing jiangsu province clindamycin was found in influent at similar concentrations 10 ng l in december 2019 chen et al 2020 suggesting a relatively low clinical use of clindamycin in jiangsu nevertheless this drug has been frequently detected in animal faeces in jiangsu guo et al 2016 indicating that the high level of clindamycin in wwtp 4 93 6 14 1 ng l in site b could be attributable to its veterinary use paired parent metabolite analysis showed that cli dmcli clindamycin n desmethyl clindamycin varied significantly fig s7 in summer and winter p 0 01 potential explanations are 1 temperature dependent degradation of both clindamycin and its metabolite holton et al 2022a or 2 in sewer transformation of metabolite to clindamycin in summer ávila et al 2021 notably clindamycin was found largely unmetabolised in bs4 evidenced by the consistent higher level of parent metabolite ratio 16 9 9 6 compared to other sites 6 1 0 9 this could be attributed to the imprudent use of clindamycin in animal husbandry in site b erythromycin clarithromycin and roxithromycin were detected in 98 6 of domestic associated ww erythromycin and roxithromycin are mainly used as human antibiotics but also have limited usage in animals while clarithromycin is human use only wang et al 2016 seasonal increases in winter were seen for all macrolides albeit at various extents comparable pndls were observed for both erythromycin and clarithromycin in the two sites roxithromycin by contrast was 11 times higher in site b pndlb 124 5 mg day 1000 inh than in site a pndla 11 1 mg day inh this clearly indicated the distinctive usage patterns for macrolides nationwide surveillance data carss china antimicrobial resistance surveillance system has revealed that bacterial resistance rate to erythromycin is the highest in jiangsu compared to all other provinces in china suggesting a history for the overuse of erythromycin and lower effectiveness in killing bacteria in clinical settings in site b carss 2022 this could explain why roxithromycin which is pharmacologically similar to erythromycin was much more preferred in site b than site a worryingly potential overuse of roxithromycin was also observed in site b for instance a concentration level lower than 50 ng l has been reported in influent samples in nanjing capital city in jiangsu in winter 2019 chen et al 2020 while much higher levels ranging between 402 6 ng l and 1304 9 ng l were recorded in site b fig s6 the highest level detected exceeded pnecmic for roxithromycin at 1 μg l bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 meaning that resistance selection could occur during wastewater transport and across the treatment process furthermore a previous study investigating 23 veterinary antibiotics in jiangsu province has reported roxithromycin albeit at low concentration levels as the most frequently detected macrolide up to 90 in manure and manure amended soils guo et al 2016 the extensive use of roxithromycin in site b may have accelerated resistance development and induced multi drug resistance to macrolides paired parent metabolite analysis showed that clr dmclr clarithromycin n desmethyl clarithromycin ratios were consistent across sampling sites and seasons fig s7 2 2 0 6 in site a and 2 0 0 5 in site b the ratios are comparable with previous study where influent clr dmclr ratio was reported at 1 85 0 55 in south africa samples holton et al 2022a in contrast ery dmery erythromycin n desmethyl erythromycin showed spatial patterns recorded at 1 4 0 7 in site a and 2 3 0 4 and 5 9 3 4 in wwtp 4 and 5 in site b respectively a ratio of approx 1 1 in wastewater influent has been reported previously holton et al 2022a erythromycin is well known for its variable bioavailability 18 45 after oral administration which may lead to differing extents of human metabolism 3 3 4 beta lactams and their metabolic consumption markers first and third generation cephalosporins cefalexin and ceftriaxone were detected in influents cefalexin showed an overall detection frequency of 42 8 in site a among which 33 3 presented in summer and 52 4 in winter cefalexin has been reported in surface waters in zhejiang at concentrations up to 283 ng l yuyang et al 2021 due to the lack of oral absorption for ceftriaxone this drug can only be given as an injection either intramuscularly or intravenously therefore the use of this drug in healthcare facilities was considered as the sole source detection frequency for ceftriaxone increased from 10 0 in summer to 22 9 in winter highest concentration recorded in the present study was at 518 4 96 9 ng l in bw4 in site b ceftriaxone was only observed in wwtp 4 with daily loads increasing from 56 4 12 3 g day in summer to 69 5 13 3 g day in winter the temporal trends observed can be attributed to both seasonal change in temperature where thermal degradation of ceftriaxone was expected holton et al 2022a and potential increased prescription in treating seasonal infectious diseases such as respiratory tract infections ceftriaxone is one of the most frequently prescribed antibiotics for hospitalised covid 19 patients accounting for 17 8 of total usage cong et al 2021 because of its poor oral bioavailability penicillin g is generally given intramuscularly or intravenously as a salt solution penicillin g was detected frequently in domestic wastewater in site a with no seasonal pattern observed although penicillin g parent compound was not seen in site b its primary metabolite penicilloic g acid was measurable in winter samples weekly average 193 8 71 3 ng l in bw4 to 206 1 157 6 ng l in bw5 similarly amoxicilloic acid presented in 80 of all winter samples while its parent compound amoxicillin was mdl given that they are reported to be the most commonly misused antibiotic groups in china li 2014 the overall low detection frequencies of cephalosporins and penicillins were likely to be mainly due to their instability in natural aquatic environments where chemical hydrolysis or cleavage of the unstable β lactam ring by β lactamases could be expected kulkarni et al 2017 for those quantifiable samples a ratio at 0 52 0 06 was observed for penicillin g penicilloic g acid comparisons of the β lactams usage patterns suggested that site b tends to prescribe more third generation cephalosporins ceftriaxone instead of the first generation cephalosporins cefalexin and penicillin g while these drugs were still in frequent use in site a 3 3 5 others azoles cyclines phenicols linezolid tb drugs and antivirus phenicols cyclines and linezolid florfenicol a veterinary antibiotic showed an overall detection frequency of 50 industrial wastewater recorded the highest daily concentration up to 5 4 μg l in bs6 fig s6 exceeding the pnec at 2 μg l for florfenicol bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 for domestic associated wastewater highest concentrations and daily loads were both recorded in bw4 at 190 6 83 6 ng l and 25 5 11 3 g day respectively suggesting contributions from industrial livestock and poultry farming in site b site a showed a higher detection frequency for florfenicol in winter 80 9 than in summer 47 6 albeit at lower levels in fact illicit uses of florfenicol in livestock and fishery production are not uncommon in china due to its effectiveness and low cost yang et al 2021 as a result this drug has been widely detected in food and drinking water hanna et al 2018 li et al 2020 constituting major exposure pathways of animal antibiotic in humans recent study has revealed that the presence of florfenicol in urine was associated with obesity risk in children wang et al 2016 notably linezolid which belongs to the class of oxazolidinones and is used as a last line human antibiotic in china was detected frequently in four of the wwtps in both seasons with concentration ranging from mdl to 96 2 12 1 ng l in bw4 daily loads increased significantly p 0 01 in winter in wwtp 1 in site a 0 3 to 1 2 g day and wwtp 4 in site b 2 5 to 9 6 g day clinical consumption of linezolid has increased significantly in recent years in china jian et al 2020 as a critically important human medicine who has warned that resistance will increase if linezolid use continues at current levels or increases in particular linezolid was among one of the frequently prescribed antibiotics for hospitalised covid 19 patients in the first phase of the pandemic cong et al 2021 which might have accelerated resistance development for cyclines overall detection frequencies for doxycycline and oxytetracycline were 56 and 17 respectively doxycycline presented in industrial wastewater in summer daily loads 1 4 0 7 g day as a result of drug production in domestic associated wastewater highest doxycycline concentration was recorded at 16 5 8 6 ng l mql in as3 azoles tb drugs and antiretrovirals due to its wide application metronidazole is among one of the most prevalent antibiotics detected in the present study and showed significant correlations with almost all drug families xie et al 2015 seasonal trends were observed for both sites p value 0 01 and 0 05 for site a and b respectively among which wwtp 1 in site a increased the most from 1 4 0 3 g day in summer to 5 8 2 7 g day in winter temperature dependent degradation of metronidazole approx 20 40 has been reported holton et al 2022a which may have contributed to decreased loads detected in summer metronidazole also presented in industrial wastewater at concentrations ranging between 1 7 and 130 3 ng l the metronidazole hydroxy metronidazole ratio showed site and season specific patterns fig s7 in site a average ratio was 6 6 0 8 and 3 6 0 6 in summer and winter respectively in site b the ratios varied considerably in wwtp 4 recorded at 18 1 10 2 in summer and 11 6 5 6 in winter while domestic wwtp 5 showed comparable levels in both seasons 4 0 1 5 in summer and 3 3 2 3 in winter the ratios calculated in this study were constantly higher than that reported by holton et al 2022a at 1 56 and 0 64 in south africa wastewater samples notably the highest parent metabolite ratio observed in wwtp 4 in site b suggested a largely unmetabolised portion of metronidazole which is indicative of poor animal farming practice and or direct disposal of unused drug first line tb drugs ethambutol isoniazid and its acid metabolite and a metabolite of pyrazinamide have been detected in 100 32 9 78 6 and 42 9 of all domestic associated wastewater respectively in general site a showed an overall higher tb drug pndls 3 5 mg day 1000 inh compared to site b 2 1 mg day 1000 inh this is consistent with the nationwide surveillance data where reported incidence of tuberculosis per 100 000 people was 31 25 in jiangsu and 45 79 in zhejiang in 2019 wang qian 2021 an antiretroviral lamivudine has been found present in 87 of domestic associated wastewater similarly to tb drug patterns pndls of lamivudine in site a were higher than in site b 3 4 community wide antibiotic consumption estimation back calculations estimating population normalised daily intake were performed for 17 compounds using correction factors and pndls where applicable consumption estimates were calculated for both parent aa and metabolite fig 5 comparable parent metabolite estimates no statistical differences p 0 05 were observed for sdz asdz smx asmx ofx dmofx and cli dmcli while mtz hmtz spy aspy and clr dmclr showed inconsistent estimates statistical differences p 0 05 in general the parent estimations gave higher consumption levels compared to their metabolites this is consistent with the observations by holton et al 2022b where antimicrobials excreted in an unchanged form were often observed to over estimate daily intake due to biotransformation via glucuronide cleavage or direct disposal of unused drug practices or topical applications not involving metabolic pathways of aa degradation as the prescription or consumption of antibiotics in the study area is not precisely monitored it should be noted that the following assumptions may be speculative table 2 lists the predicted mass of antibiotics consumed in the communities and comparisons between different areas in china a previous catchment study has validated that the acetyl metabolites of sulfonamides and the unchanged form of tmp were typically better at estimating community antibiotic consumption holton et al 2022b after correction a ratio at 4 9 2 9 was observed for smx tmp which is closer to the expected co prescription pattern for smx tmp at 5 1 both spy and aspy were considered as sulfasalazine metabolites and the higher spy estimate could be due to the glucuronide cleavage and biotransformation from sulfasalazine the averaged estimated sulfasalazine daily intake using spy was 150 3 mg day 1000 inh similar to the consumption level at 131 6 mg day 1000 inh reported in a case study in south china zhou et al 2013 the unchanged mtz showed a 4 times higher consumption estimate than hmtz as suggested in the previous study hmtz should be considered as a better predictor when comparing to prescription data using a correction factor of 3 66 after applying the corresponding correction factors ofx remained the most popular quinolone consumed especially in site a cip and nor were more preferred in site b than site a it is interesting to note that ofx cf 1 25 and dmofx cf 29 23 showed good concordance 20 variation after correction as quinolones are largely excreted in the unchanged form parent ofx estimation is more favoured due to its high detection frequency in wastewater sample overall quinolone consumption levels in the study sites were generally lower than that reported in other areas in china table 2 cli and dmcli estimates were also consistent at 14 variation however cli was observed largely unmetabolised in wwtp 4 in site b which could overestimate the daily intake as validated in previous study dmcli should be used for predicting cli intake holton et al 2022b mean consumption value at 89 6 mg day 1000 inh was similar to the cli level reported in a case study in north china at 90 mg day 1000 inh zhang et al 2019 statistically significant difference p 0 002 was observed for clr and dmclr estimates using cfs of 2 92 and 18 2 respectively an overestimation of dmclr was verified in the previous study holton et al 2022b therefore the unchanged parent was preferred for predicating clr consumption and the calculated mean value was 49 7 mg day 1000 inh this level was comparable to clr usage in south china and 5 times lower than its usage in north china table 2 3 5 limitations two limitations should be considered for the back calculated daily intake although this study has discussed stability of the analytes with regards to temporal variations using holton et al 2022b observations potential degradation transformation during in sewer transport introduces uncertainties in consumption estimation gracia lor et al 2017 mean residence time of wastewater in sewers varied according to the population size while the current calculation assumed that the losses from toilets to wwtps were the same across all sites this may cause an underestimation in consumption for certain compounds which underwent longer sewer residence times another limitation is the potential impact of covid 19 pandemic on seasonal antibiotic usage patterns it was clear that during both sampling campaigns covid 19 measures were strictly in place in the study regions especially for the management of antibiotics commonly used for respiratory tract infections data not shown further data triangulation will be conducted using local medicine diary record data collected during the sampling period to explore the impact of covid 19 measures on amr at the community level 4 conclusions wastewater based epidemiology wbe was applied for the first time in eastern china for the estimation of community wide exposure to antibiotics including the analysis of both parent and metabolic consumption biomarkers in wastewater the main conclusions are as follows 1 environmental sample determined aa concentrations and daily loads allowed direct comparison between catchments of different population sizes results indicated that the population sizes showed a strong correlation with both concentrations and daily loads and site b represented higher community wide exposure level to antibiotics which is consistent with trends reported from the national antimicrobial surveillance network at the provincial level 2 who aware access watch and reserve metric analysis suggested that there is more conservative use of antibiotics in site a the access group accounted for 42 and 20 of total antibiotics detected in site a and b respectively which do not reach the target indicator proposed by who of 60 this indicates that antibiotic stewardship policies need to be optimised in the study regions the high level of the reported watch group up to 88 5 was mainly due to the contribution of quinolones and macrolides 3 paired parent metabolites analysis from one wwtp revealed the potential inappropriate use of antibiotics in one community at site b evidenced by the higher parent metabolite ratios for both clindamycin and metronidazole compared to other communities high levels of veterinary antibiotic residues in site b may potentially reflect poor animal farming practice in the area 4 emissions of antibiotic residues from manufacturing processes have been observed in this study when entering the local wwtp after discharge from the production site the highest concentrations for specific antibiotics were well above the predicted no effect concentrations pnecmic and the highest daily mass loads exceeded the overall load from the community serving over 600 000 population 5 correction factors accounting for aa metabolism were applied to the environmental data to estimate community consumption levels holton et al 2022b comparable parent metabolite estimates were observed for sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole and their acetyl metabolites ofloxacin and clindamycin and their desmethyl metabolites indicating the potential for using either parent or metabolite biomarkers for consumption estimation in contrast inconsistent estimates were observed for metronidazole and its hydroxy metabolite sulfapyridine and its acetyl metabolite and clarithromycin and its desmethyl metabolite additional local clinical data on consumption e g prescription records medicine diaries etc are needed to further validate the suitability of these biomarkers credit authorship contribution statement like xu conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation writing original draft writing review editing jinxin zang

15685,wastewater based epidemiology wbe has potential to identify the epidemiological links between people animals and the environment as part of antimicrobial resistance amr surveillance in this study we investigated six wastewater treatment plants wwtps serving six communities located in two regions in eastern china site a in zhejiang and site b in jiangsu province to assess the public use of antimicrobial agents aa fifty antimicrobials and 24 of their metabolites were quantified using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms spatiotemporal trends were established for measured concentrations daily loads and population normalised daily loads daily aa mass loads varied between 1 6 g day and 324 6 g day reflecting the wwtp scales with macrolides and β lactams showing the highest overall environmental burden at 223 7 g day and 173 7 g day respectively emissions of antibiotic residues from manufacturing have been observed with the peak daily load 12 fold higher than the overall load from a community serving a population of over 600 000 community exposure levels of 225 2 156 2 mg day 1000 inhabitant and 351 9 133 5 mg day 1000 inhabitant were recorded in site a and b respectively paired parent metabolites analysis identified a large proportion 64 78 of un metabolised metronidazole and clindamycin at site b indicating improper disposal of unused drugs either in the community or in livestock production consumption levels calculated via wbe suggested relatively low antimicrobial usage in eastern china compared to other areas in china this first application of wbe in eastern china to assess the community wide exposure to aas has potential to inform regional antimicrobial stewardship graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology antibiotic antimicrobial eastern china antimicrobial resistance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antimicrobial resistance amr has been identified by the world health organisation who as one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity a recent comprehensive study of the global burden of amr reported an estimated 4 95 million deaths associated with bacterial amr in 2019 murray et al 2022 in addition the covid 19 pandemic has also caused an unforeseen impact on amr particularly in developing countries ghosh et al 2021 this is partially due to the widespread use of antibiotics to treat covid 19 patients regardless of severity of illness in the first phase of the pandemic cong et al 2021 while global and coordinated action plans are required in order to address the spread of amr the lack of surveillance data in many locations is one of the major challenges in need of resolution murray et al 2022 compared to the traditional clinical surveillance systems a wastewater based approach could be a promising tool especially for low and middle income countries because of lower resource demand larsson and flach 2021 wastewater based epidemiology wbe is a new epidemiology approach that can be applied for environmental surveillance of amr to identify epidemiological links between humans animals and the environment sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 wastewater represents a complex matrix containing a wide range of chemical and biological markers including city stressors e g toxicants and infectious agents and physiological processes e g specific disease linked proteins antibiotic resistance genes and metabolites choi et al 2018 kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a some recent studies have successfully applied wbe to investigate amr status both regionally and nationally for example quinolones and quinolone resistance gene loads have been monitored in wastewaters across seven european countries castrignanò et al 2020b antibiotic use has been estimated during a flu season in eight densely populated areas in beijing china zhang et al 2019 wbe combined with local prescription data has been applied in southwest england to quantify antimicrobials usage holton et al 2022b parent compounds active antimicrobial agents aas are usually selected as biomarkers however the inclusion of aa metabolites in wbe analyses adds a further dimension to amr exposure assessment the ratios between parent drugs and their corresponding metabolites in wastewater can also be used to verify aa consumption levels and direct disposal of unused hence unmetabolised drugs kasprzyk hordern et al 2021b in the context of an ecological risk assessment metabolites can be found at high concentrations with high toxicity mobility and persistence in the environment singh et al 2021 it is therefore advisable to include key metabolites where possible to fully understand the overall environmental burden of antibiotics for example the human metabolite sulfoxide clindamycin has been detected in influent samples to obtain accurate estimates of clindamycin input loads ávila et al 2021 marx et al 2015 oertel et al 2014 recent studies in china have shown the potential to use sulfonamide quinolone and macrolide parent drugs and metabolites to estimate the nationwide consumption level gao et al 2022 han et al 2022 there are several considerations for the application of wbe to assess community wide exposure to antimicrobials firstly in order to capture the dynamics of wastewater a flow or time proportional sampling strategy should be adopted secondly daily flow rates of influent are essential to convert the measured concentration into daily mass loads thirdly the population size in the wwtp catchment is key to allowing direct comparison between different communities finally the in sewer stability and in sample stability of the selected biomarkers should be considered for instance longer sewer residence times could lead to degradation transformation of oxidative stress biomarkers gracia lor et al 2017 o brien et al 2019 to date a few studies have reported mass loads of aas per capita in wwtps in china gao et al 2022 han et al 2022 wang et al 2018 yuan et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 two of which have included metabolite biomarkers in the consumption estimation due to dense populations an intensive livestock production industry and extensive antibiotic use eastern china has been identified as a hotspot for amr cai et al 2022b two economically and epidemiologically distinct residential areas zhejiang province site a and jiangsu province site b located in eastern china were selected in the present study the study sites were selected to facilitate the use of existing epidemiology study cohorts to explore the potential long term effects of antibiotic use and exposure to environmental antibiotic residues seventy four aas including both parent aas and their metabolites were monitored in the surveyed communities in two sampling campaigns accounting for different seasons the aim of this study is to assess the spatiotemporal community wide public exposure to aas public intake vs total environmental burden using a wbe approach this has potential to inform antimicrobial stewardship interventions in the local area 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials a total of 50 aas and 24 major metabolites were targeted in the present study the selected aas covered a wide range of antibiotic classes including β lactams sulfonamides and trimethoprim macrolides and lincomycin quinolones azoles phenicols cyclines nitrofurans and tuberculosis tb drugs two antiretrovirals emtricitabine and lamivudine were included due to their significant association with tb and hiv coinfection a total of 21 stable isotope labelled internal standards istd were used for the quantification of the target compounds a

as wet and dry seasons in the study areas wwtp 1 3 are grouped as as summer and aw winter in site a while wwtp 4 6 are grouped as bs summer and bw winter in site b in order to obtain a representative influent sample a flow proportional composite sampling strategy was adopted by using an auto sampler jh 8000d qingdao to collect 10 ml of the influents at regular 15 min time intervals for 24 h on the day of collection 50 ml of the composite wastewater samples were spiked in duplicate with 50 ng of an internal standard mixture 50 μl of 1 mg l mix samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and frozen 20 ⁰c for shipment to the uk and processing 2 3 sample preparation and analysis solid phase extraction spe was conducted at fudan university using sample preparation protocol developed by

originpro 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection frequency classification and distribution of antimicrobials a total of 39 out of 74 aas were detected in all samples both mixed type wastewater and domestic wastewater showed similar detection frequencies 73 and industrial wastewater showed a lower detection frequency 14 overall detection frequency and concentration range for each aa in the sampling sites excluding industrial wastewater are shown in fig 1 in general macrolides and sulfonamides showed the highest detection frequencies followed by quinolones and other aas β lactams were found at the lowest detection frequencies 20 40 in influent samples from all wwtps the majority of analytes recorded a concentration range between 10 and 100 ng l in the influents with site a showed a slightly lower mean value at 44 0 55 3 ng l than site b 63 9 116 0 ng l highest concentration range 500 ng l was seen for ceftriaxone and roxithromycin and the latter varied the most in the two sites numbers of aas detected daily are provided in fig s2 according to the who aware access watch and reserve metrics access group antibiotics 9 in total accounted for 11 5 52 5 of all antibiotics detected while watch group antibiotics 11 in total accounted for 46 9 88 5 fig s3 a target indicator proposed by who specifies a country level target of at least 60 of overall antibiotic consumption from the access group who 2021 higher percentage of the watch group observed is mainly due to the contribution of quinolones and macrolides indicating that these drugs need to be prioritised for antibiotic stewardship table s3 shows the differences in ab classification in the study areas the levels calculated in wastewaters are commensurate with hospital antibiotic use in china hsia et al 2019 for instance who watch group antibiotics accounted for up to 82 2 of all antibiotic therapies in children wang et al 2020 proportional abundances for each drug class across all sites seasons are provided in fig s4 3 2 overall spatial temporal trends for concentrations daily mass loads and pndls spatiotemporal week averaged antibiotic by drug class concentrations daily mass loads and population normalised daily loads are presented in fig 2 industrial wastewater wwtp 6 showed the highest overall concentration as a result of drug manufacturing mainly due to the contribution of sulfonamide and amphenicol seasonal increases in winter were seen for all domestic associated wastewater among which wwtp 5 in site b increased the most 220 flow rate varied considerably according to the capacity of each wwtp ranging from 2 4 106 l day in bw5 to 1 4 108 l day in bs4 fig s5 overall daily mass loads varied between 1 6 g day and 324 6 g day as a result of changing flows fig 2 spatiotemporal trends of pndls are presented in fig 2 site b showed a higher community exposure level 351 9 133 5 mg day 1000 inh than site a 225 2 156 2 mg day 1000 inh higher mass loads at 672 182 mg day 1000 inh have been reported in guangdong south china zhou et al 2013 and at 630 42 mg day 1000 inh in wuxi city east china yuan et al 2015 wwtp 4 in site b which served the largest population in the area and represented the most complex influent compositions recorded the highest pndls at 422 6 126 5 mg day 1000 inh compared to other wwtps correlation analysis on the population size with overall concentration and daily load is shown in fig 3 a antibiotic residue levels and daily mass loads were driven by community size as evidenced by the strong and significant positive correlations pearson s r 0 95 p 0 05 between these parameters this observation is consistent with previous studies elder et al 2021 kasprzyk hordern et al 2021a correlation analysis on the weekly average was performed to explore the potential of co prescribing patterns metronidazole cefalexin clindamycin and clarithromycin as well as their metabolites showed significant correlations p 0 05 with more than 35 of all analytes indicating their popularities as broad spectrum antibiotics for co prescribing with other drug classes fig 3b table s4 3 3 drug class observations spatiotemporal trends have been subdivided by drug classes for the following data interpretation fig 4 results classified by wwtps are provided in supplementary material fig s6 3 3 1 quinolones and their metabolic consumption markers nine out of 19 quinolones including metabolites were detected in influents across all sampling sites among which ofloxacin showed the highest abundance in both sites influent ofloxacin concentration exceeding predicted no effect concentration pnec derived from minimal inhibitory concentration mic data at 500 ng l bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 was observed in as1 fig s6 with daily loads increasing accordingly from 5 4 g day to 15 7 and 17 9 g day this indicates that quinolone resistance could potentially be selected for in sewer and across the wastewater treatment process especially when activated sludge or sequencing batch reactor treatment is adopted castrignanò et al 2020a norfloxacin is the second prevalent quinolone in wastewater influent detected in all domestic associated wws average daily loads of norfloxacin ranged from 20 1 mg day in aw3 to 3 9 1 5 g day in bw4 no noticeable seasonality was observed for either ofloxacin p value 0 46 or norfloxacin p value 0 78 lomefloxacin showed a lower overall detection frequency at 48 among which 30 was quantifiable regardless of the relatively low detection frequency lomefloxacin presented consistently in all bw5 samples with an average influent concentration at 37 3 24 4 ng l fig s6 this level is 19 fold higher than the average value 2 0 1 2 ng l from other influent samples the use of lomefloxacin norfloxacin and ofloxacin has been banned in food producing animals in china since 2016 maprc 2015 as a reserve group antibiotic that should be treated as a last line option the high level of lomefloxacin in bw5 may indicate an overuse or misuse of this drug in the community gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were only sporadically detected across the sampling sites and not present in pure domestic wws gatifloxacin was found only in summer samples at 3 7 1 1 ng l while moxifloxacin showed a higher detection frequency at 15 and was present in both seasons moxifloxacin drug production in site b may have also contributed to its presence in the influent in contrast a lower concentration range between 0 6 and 6 7 ng l has been reported in european wws castrignanò et al 2020b enrofloxacin a veterinary antibiotic was found consistently in 57 30 quantifiable of all samples daily influent concentration ranged between 0 25 ng l and 93 7 9 7 ng l in bs4 as expected wwtp 4 in site b represented the highest environmental enrofloxacin residues presumably due to the contribution from veterinary settings such as pig chicken and sheep farming notably enrofloxacin was the most frequently detected veterinary antibiotic in manure based fertilizers in the sample region qian et al 2016 ciprofloxacin is an access group human antibiotic but is also preferred as veterinary medicine in china this drug was present in 64 29 quantifiable of all samples enrofloxacin is metabolised to a large extent into active ciprofloxacin in most species trouchon and lefebvre 2016 a ratio between ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin at 0 34 was reported in animals rao et al 2002 which is comparable with the ratio observed at 0 38 0 19 in bs4 higher ratios at 0 81 0 25 and 8 6 5 3 were recorded in bw4 and bw5 suggesting that high prevalence of ciprofloxacin in winter samples originated from human consumption direct disposal as well as its formation as a metabolite of enrofloxacin ofloxacin n oxide was detected largely below the quantification limit therefore has been excluded for parent metabolite analysis ofx dmofx ratio ofloxacin desmethyl ofloxacin varied considerably across sampling sites and seasons fig s7 ranging from 8 8 5 3 in bs5 to 57 3 29 4 in as1 this is not uncommon for a high ofx dmofx ratio as the median human excretion rate urine and faeces of dmofx is 3 56 holton et al 2022b a case study of wastewater from a hospital inpatient department reported at least one magnitude lower level of metabolite compared to ofloxacin cai et al 2022a wwtp 1 in site a recorded the highest ofx dmofx ratios in both seasons fig s7 likely due to the contribution from the production of ofloxacin eye drops in this site 3 3 2 sulfonamides trimethoprim and their metabolic consumption markers sulfonamide antibiotics and their metabolites were detected consistently across all sampling sites as sulfapyridine is not licensed in china as human or veterinary medicine the presence of this drug is only considered as an active metabolite of human anti inflammatory sulfasalazine liu et al 2017 yang et al 2011 for industrial wastewater wwtp 6 in site b fig s6 trimethoprim and sulfadiazine are the two predominant drugs present in both seasons trimethoprim was detected as high as up to 8 6 0 4 μg l in bs6 nearly 350 fold higher than the average concentration of trimethoprim 24 5 14 3 ng l in domestic associated wws it should be noted that the concentration level reached the estimated upper boundary for the minimal selective concentration for trimethoprim resistant bacteria bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 sulfadiazine was also found at 2 62 0 27 μg l on the same day 830 fold higher than the average concentration found mql to 9 8 ng l in other types of wws this highlights the importance of acknowledging pharmaceutical factories as potential major contributors of antibiotics entering the environment interestingly a strong positive correlation pearson s r 0 94 p 1 0 10 5 was found between trimethoprim and sulfadiazine in industrial wastewater indicating the potential concurrent mass production of these two drugs in local manufacturing plants both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim showed seasonality and the daily load of the latter increased significantly p 0 05 in winter as sulfonamides are generally thermally stable holton et al 2022a usage patterns may correspond to disease seasonality co prescribing patterns were observed for sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim as co trimoxazole as evidenced by the significant positive correlations pearson s r 0 70 and 0 53 in site a and b respectively p 0 004 between the two drugs results showed a ratio of 2 4 1 2 for smx tmp in wastewater containing domestic sewage the value is within the range between 1 1 and 3 3 for the theoretical ratio of smx tmp in raw wastewater indicating that human consumption excretion of co trimoxazole is the main origin for the presence of these two drugs in the study areas thiebault 2020 sulfadiazine showed the lowest detection frequency 64 compared to other sulfonamides average daily influent concentrations of sulfapyridine ranged from 18 0 7 9 ng l bw5 to 96 8 21 0 ng l bs4 much lower levels of sulfapyridine have been reported in previous case studies where this drug was either not detectable or present at very low concentrations ranging between 0 4 and 2 2 ng l in wastewater influents chen et al 2015 hanna et al 2018 these variations reflect the regional difference in the usage patterns of sulfasalazine smx asmx n acetyl smx and spy aspy n acetyl spy are discussed here to verify consumption levels vs direct disposal of unused drugs sulfadiazine and its metabolite were only present sporadically and have been excluded for paired parent metabolite analysis in general both smx asmx and spy aspy showed consistent ratios across the sampling sites fig s7 ranging from 0 5 to 1 2 and from 1 1 to 2 4 respectively this is somewhat expected as the acetyl metabolites of sulfonamides are excreted as a large proportion of the drug 22 40 where parent compounds excreted at a relatively lower portion 15 37 holton et al 2022b no seasonal patterns were observed for the ratios regardless of a higher antibiotic consumption in winter indicating rational uses of these drugs in the area 3 3 3 macrolides lincomycin and their metabolic consumption markers distinctive clindamycin usage patterns were found in the two sites significant seasonal increases in winter were seen in site a p value 0 001 0 01 0 05 for wwtp 1 2 and 3 respectively while no such trends were observed in site b concentration of clindamycin in domestic wastewater in site b were recorded at 5 8 3 0 ng l in nanjing jiangsu province clindamycin was found in influent at similar concentrations 10 ng l in december 2019 chen et al 2020 suggesting a relatively low clinical use of clindamycin in jiangsu nevertheless this drug has been frequently detected in animal faeces in jiangsu guo et al 2016 indicating that the high level of clindamycin in wwtp 4 93 6 14 1 ng l in site b could be attributable to its veterinary use paired parent metabolite analysis showed that cli dmcli clindamycin n desmethyl clindamycin varied significantly fig s7 in summer and winter p 0 01 potential explanations are 1 temperature dependent degradation of both clindamycin and its metabolite holton et al 2022a or 2 in sewer transformation of metabolite to clindamycin in summer ávila et al 2021 notably clindamycin was found largely unmetabolised in bs4 evidenced by the consistent higher level of parent metabolite ratio 16 9 9 6 compared to other sites 6 1 0 9 this could be attributed to the imprudent use of clindamycin in animal husbandry in site b erythromycin clarithromycin and roxithromycin were detected in 98 6 of domestic associated ww erythromycin and roxithromycin are mainly used as human antibiotics but also have limited usage in animals while clarithromycin is human use only wang et al 2016 seasonal increases in winter were seen for all macrolides albeit at various extents comparable pndls were observed for both erythromycin and clarithromycin in the two sites roxithromycin by contrast was 11 times higher in site b pndlb 124 5 mg day 1000 inh than in site a pndla 11 1 mg day inh this clearly indicated the distinctive usage patterns for macrolides nationwide surveillance data carss china antimicrobial resistance surveillance system has revealed that bacterial resistance rate to erythromycin is the highest in jiangsu compared to all other provinces in china suggesting a history for the overuse of erythromycin and lower effectiveness in killing bacteria in clinical settings in site b carss 2022 this could explain why roxithromycin which is pharmacologically similar to erythromycin was much more preferred in site b than site a worryingly potential overuse of roxithromycin was also observed in site b for instance a concentration level lower than 50 ng l has been reported in influent samples in nanjing capital city in jiangsu in winter 2019 chen et al 2020 while much higher levels ranging between 402 6 ng l and 1304 9 ng l were recorded in site b fig s6 the highest level detected exceeded pnecmic for roxithromycin at 1 μg l bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 meaning that resistance selection could occur during wastewater transport and across the treatment process furthermore a previous study investigating 23 veterinary antibiotics in jiangsu province has reported roxithromycin albeit at low concentration levels as the most frequently detected macrolide up to 90 in manure and manure amended soils guo et al 2016 the extensive use of roxithromycin in site b may have accelerated resistance development and induced multi drug resistance to macrolides paired parent metabolite analysis showed that clr dmclr clarithromycin n desmethyl clarithromycin ratios were consistent across sampling sites and seasons fig s7 2 2 0 6 in site a and 2 0 0 5 in site b the ratios are comparable with previous study where influent clr dmclr ratio was reported at 1 85 0 55 in south africa samples holton et al 2022a in contrast ery dmery erythromycin n desmethyl erythromycin showed spatial patterns recorded at 1 4 0 7 in site a and 2 3 0 4 and 5 9 3 4 in wwtp 4 and 5 in site b respectively a ratio of approx 1 1 in wastewater influent has been reported previously holton et al 2022a erythromycin is well known for its variable bioavailability 18 45 after oral administration which may lead to differing extents of human metabolism 3 3 4 beta lactams and their metabolic consumption markers first and third generation cephalosporins cefalexin and ceftriaxone were detected in influents cefalexin showed an overall detection frequency of 42 8 in site a among which 33 3 presented in summer and 52 4 in winter cefalexin has been reported in surface waters in zhejiang at concentrations up to 283 ng l yuyang et al 2021 due to the lack of oral absorption for ceftriaxone this drug can only be given as an injection either intramuscularly or intravenously therefore the use of this drug in healthcare facilities was considered as the sole source detection frequency for ceftriaxone increased from 10 0 in summer to 22 9 in winter highest concentration recorded in the present study was at 518 4 96 9 ng l in bw4 in site b ceftriaxone was only observed in wwtp 4 with daily loads increasing from 56 4 12 3 g day in summer to 69 5 13 3 g day in winter the temporal trends observed can be attributed to both seasonal change in temperature where thermal degradation of ceftriaxone was expected holton et al 2022a and potential increased prescription in treating seasonal infectious diseases such as respiratory tract infections ceftriaxone is one of the most frequently prescribed antibiotics for hospitalised covid 19 patients accounting for 17 8 of total usage cong et al 2021 because of its poor oral bioavailability penicillin g is generally given intramuscularly or intravenously as a salt solution penicillin g was detected frequently in domestic wastewater in site a with no seasonal pattern observed although penicillin g parent compound was not seen in site b its primary metabolite penicilloic g acid was measurable in winter samples weekly average 193 8 71 3 ng l in bw4 to 206 1 157 6 ng l in bw5 similarly amoxicilloic acid presented in 80 of all winter samples while its parent compound amoxicillin was mdl given that they are reported to be the most commonly misused antibiotic groups in china li 2014 the overall low detection frequencies of cephalosporins and penicillins were likely to be mainly due to their instability in natural aquatic environments where chemical hydrolysis or cleavage of the unstable β lactam ring by β lactamases could be expected kulkarni et al 2017 for those quantifiable samples a ratio at 0 52 0 06 was observed for penicillin g penicilloic g acid comparisons of the β lactams usage patterns suggested that site b tends to prescribe more third generation cephalosporins ceftriaxone instead of the first generation cephalosporins cefalexin and penicillin g while these drugs were still in frequent use in site a 3 3 5 others azoles cyclines phenicols linezolid tb drugs and antivirus phenicols cyclines and linezolid florfenicol a veterinary antibiotic showed an overall detection frequency of 50 industrial wastewater recorded the highest daily concentration up to 5 4 μg l in bs6 fig s6 exceeding the pnec at 2 μg l for florfenicol bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 for domestic associated wastewater highest concentrations and daily loads were both recorded in bw4 at 190 6 83 6 ng l and 25 5 11 3 g day respectively suggesting contributions from industrial livestock and poultry farming in site b site a showed a higher detection frequency for florfenicol in winter 80 9 than in summer 47 6 albeit at lower levels in fact illicit uses of florfenicol in livestock and fishery production are not uncommon in china due to its effectiveness and low cost yang et al 2021 as a result this drug has been widely detected in food and drinking water hanna et al 2018 li et al 2020 constituting major exposure pathways of animal antibiotic in humans recent study has revealed that the presence of florfenicol in urine was associated with obesity risk in children wang et al 2016 notably linezolid which belongs to the class of oxazolidinones and is used as a last line human antibiotic in china was detected frequently in four of the wwtps in both seasons with concentration ranging from mdl to 96 2 12 1 ng l in bw4 daily loads increased significantly p 0 01 in winter in wwtp 1 in site a 0 3 to 1 2 g day and wwtp 4 in site b 2 5 to 9 6 g day clinical consumption of linezolid has increased significantly in recent years in china jian et al 2020 as a critically important human medicine who has warned that resistance will increase if linezolid use continues at current levels or increases in particular linezolid was among one of the frequently prescribed antibiotics for hospitalised covid 19 patients in the first phase of the pandemic cong et al 2021 which might have accelerated resistance development for cyclines overall detection frequencies for doxycycline and oxytetracycline were 56 and 17 respectively doxycycline presented in industrial wastewater in summer daily loads 1 4 0 7 g day as a result of drug production in domestic associated wastewater highest doxycycline concentration was recorded at 16 5 8 6 ng l mql in as3 azoles tb drugs and antiretrovirals due to its wide application metronidazole is among one of the most prevalent antibiotics detected in the present study and showed significant correlations with almost all drug families xie et al 2015 seasonal trends were observed for both sites p value 0 01 and 0 05 for site a and b respectively among which wwtp 1 in site a increased the most from 1 4 0 3 g day in summer to 5 8 2 7 g day in winter temperature dependent degradation of metronidazole approx 20 40 has been reported holton et al 2022a which may have contributed to decreased loads detected in summer metronidazole also presented in industrial wastewater at concentrations ranging between 1 7 and 130 3 ng l the metronidazole hydroxy metronidazole ratio showed site and season specific patterns fig s7 in site a average ratio was 6 6 0 8 and 3 6 0 6 in summer and winter respectively in site b the ratios varied considerably in wwtp 4 recorded at 18 1 10 2 in summer and 11 6 5 6 in winter while domestic wwtp 5 showed comparable levels in both seasons 4 0 1 5 in summer and 3 3 2 3 in winter the ratios calculated in this study were constantly higher than that reported by holton et al 2022a at 1 56 and 0 64 in south africa wastewater samples notably the highest parent metabolite ratio observed in wwtp 4 in site b suggested a largely unmetabolised portion of metronidazole which is indicative of poor animal farming practice and or direct disposal of unused drug first line tb drugs ethambutol isoniazid and its acid metabolite and a metabolite of pyrazinamide have been detected in 100 32 9 78 6 and 42 9 of all domestic associated wastewater respectively in general site a showed an overall higher tb drug pndls 3 5 mg day 1000 inh compared to site b 2 1 mg day 1000 inh this is consistent with the nationwide surveillance data where reported incidence of tuberculosis per 100 000 people was 31 25 in jiangsu and 45 79 in zhejiang in 2019 wang qian 2021 an antiretroviral lamivudine has been found present in 87 of domestic associated wastewater similarly to tb drug patterns pndls of lamivudine in site a were higher than in site b 3 4 community wide antibiotic consumption estimation back calculations estimating population normalised daily intake were performed for 17 compounds using correction factors and pndls where applicable consumption estimates were calculated for both parent aa and metabolite fig 5 comparable parent metabolite estimates no statistical differences p 0 05 were observed for sdz asdz smx asmx ofx dmofx and cli dmcli while mtz hmtz spy aspy and clr dmclr showed inconsistent estimates statistical differences p 0 05 in general the parent estimations gave higher consumption levels compared to their metabolites this is consistent with the observations by holton et al 2022b where antimicrobials excreted in an unchanged form were often observed to over estimate daily intake due to biotransformation via glucuronide cleavage or direct disposal of unused drug practices or topical applications not involving metabolic pathways of aa degradation as the prescription or consumption of antibiotics in the study area is not precisely monitored it should be noted that the following assumptions may be speculative table 2 lists the predicted mass of antibiotics consumed in the communities and comparisons between different areas in china a previous catchment study has validated that the acetyl metabolites of sulfonamides and the unchanged form of tmp were typically better at estimating community antibiotic consumption holton et al 2022b after correction a ratio at 4 9 2 9 was observed for smx tmp which is closer to the expected co prescription pattern for smx tmp at 5 1 both spy and aspy were considered as sulfasalazine metabolites and the higher spy estimate could be due to the glucuronide cleavage and biotransformation from sulfasalazine the averaged estimated sulfasalazine daily intake using spy was 150 3 mg day 1000 inh similar to the consumption level at 131 6 mg day 1000 inh reported in a case study in south china zhou et al 2013 the unchanged mtz showed a 4 times higher consumption estimate than hmtz as suggested in the previous study hmtz should be considered as a better predictor when comparing to prescription data using a correction factor of 3 66 after applying the corresponding correction factors ofx remained the most popular quinolone consumed especially in site a cip and nor were more preferred in site b than site a it is interesting to note that ofx cf 1 25 and dmofx cf 29 23 showed good concordance 20 variation after correction as quinolones are largely excreted in the unchanged form parent ofx estimation is more favoured due to its high detection frequency in wastewater sample overall quinolone consumption levels in the study sites were generally lower than that reported in other areas in china table 2 cli and dmcli estimates were also consistent at 14 variation however cli was observed largely unmetabolised in wwtp 4 in site b which could overestimate the daily intake as validated in previous study dmcli should be used for predicting cli intake holton et al 2022b mean consumption value at 89 6 mg day 1000 inh was similar to the cli level reported in a case study in north china at 90 mg day 1000 inh zhang et al 2019 statistically significant difference p 0 002 was observed for clr and dmclr estimates using cfs of 2 92 and 18 2 respectively an overestimation of dmclr was verified in the previous study holton et al 2022b therefore the unchanged parent was preferred for predicating clr consumption and the calculated mean value was 49 7 mg day 1000 inh this level was comparable to clr usage in south china and 5 times lower than its usage in north china table 2 3 5 limitations two limitations should be considered for the back calculated daily intake although this study has discussed stability of the analytes with regards to temporal variations using holton et al 2022b observations potential degradation transformation during in sewer transport introduces uncertainties in consumption estimation gracia lor et al 2017 mean residence time of wastewater in sewers varied according to the population size while the current calculation assumed that the losses from toilets to wwtps were the same across all sites this may cause an underestimation in consumption for certain compounds which underwent longer sewer residence times another limitation is the potential impact of covid 19 pandemic on seasonal antibiotic usage patterns it was clear that during both sampling campaigns covid 19 measures were strictly in place in the study regions especially for the management of antibiotics commonly used for respiratory tract infections data not shown further data triangulation will be conducted using local medicine diary record data collected during the sampling period to explore the impact of covid 19 measures on amr at the community level 4 conclusions wastewater based epidemiology wbe was applied for the first time in eastern china for the estimation of community wide exposure to antibiotics including the analysis of both parent and metabolic consumption biomarkers in wastewater the main conclusions are as follows 1 environmental sample determined aa concentrations and daily loads allowed direct comparison between catchments of different population sizes results indicated that the population sizes showed a strong correlation with both concentrations and daily loads and site b represented higher community wide exposure level to antibiotics which is consistent with trends reported from the national antimicrobial surveillance network at the provincial level 2 who aware access watch and reserve metric analysis suggested that there is more conservative use of antibiotics in site a the access group accounted for 42 and 20 of total antibiotics detected in site a and b respectively which do not reach the target indicator proposed by who of 60 this indicates that antibiotic stewardship policies need to be optimised in the study regions the high level of the reported watch group up to 88 5 was mainly due to the contribution of quinolones and macrolides 3 paired parent metabolites analysis from one wwtp revealed the potential inappropriate use of antibiotics in one community at site b evidenced by the higher parent metabolite ratios for both clindamycin and metronidazole compared to other communities high levels of veterinary antibiotic residues in site b may potentially reflect poor animal farming practice in the area 4 emissions of antibiotic residues from manufacturing processes have been observed in this study when entering the local wwtp after discharge from the production site the highest concentrations for specific antibiotics were well above the predicted no effect concentrations pnecmic and the highest daily mass loads exceeded the overall load from the community serving over 600 000 population 5 correction factors accounting for aa metabolism were applied to the environmental data to estimate community consumption levels holton et al 2022b comparable parent metabolite estimates were observed for sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole and their acetyl metabolites ofloxacin and clindamycin and their desmethyl metabolites indicating the potential for using either parent or metabolite biomarkers for consumption estimation in contrast inconsistent estimates were observed for metronidazole and its hydroxy metabolite sulfapyridine and its acetyl metabolite and clarithromycin and its desmethyl metabolite additional local clinical data on consumption e g prescription records medicine diaries etc are needed to further validate the suitability of these biomarkers credit authorship contribution statement like xu conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation writing original draft writing review editing jinxin zang

15686,particulate composition provides important information for understanding the changes in underwater light fields and primary productivity in this study a semianalytical algorithm based on rayleigh corrected reflectance at 678 nm and 748 nm on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images was used to estimate the ratio of chlorophyll a to total suspended solids chla tss which characterizes the particulate composition of the great lakes the long term spatial and temporal characteristics of chla tss in the great lakes from 2000 to 2020 were obtained the results demonstrated that lake superior had the highest average chla tss values 5 79 0 76 µg mg while lake erie had the lowest average chla tss values 2 93 0 76 µg mg the mann kendall test showed that the chla tss of the great lakes all showed an increasing trend notably in lake michigan with 88 23 pixels showing significant increasing trend climatic and hydrological factors dominated the intra annual variation of chla tss with contribution rates ranging from 71 47 to 92 54 through the annual chla tss change pattern analysis it was found that the contribution of wind speed to the annual variation in chla tss was slight changes in temperature played a major role in the interannual variability of chla tss in lake superior and ontario runoff and settlement were the major contributors in lake huron and michigan while cropland dominated the chla tss interannual variability in lake erie furthermore the significantly low values of chla tss in spring had the potential to predict the occurrence of blooms in western lake erie and the spatial distribution of chla tss could help predict the location of blooms in the next few days graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords particulate composition chla tss great lakes modis influencing factors data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction particulate composition is a key factor in determining the refractive index and it affects the underwater light field wozniak et al 2010 xue et al 2020 inconsistent optical properties will be observed with different particulate compositions under the same particulate concentration astoreca et al 2012 woźniak et al 2022 the increase in the proportion of organic particles will lead to a decrease in the refractive index and a decrease in the backscattering ratio twardowski et al 2001 whitmire et al 2007 the change in the underwater light field leads to a change in the photosynthesis efficiency which further influences the primary productivity and significantly affects the aquatic ecological environment furthermore organic and inorganic particles impact aquatic ecosystems in different ways kratzer et al 2020 liu et al 2019 a study xue et al 2020 has shown that particulate composition can reflect the process of eutrophication and indicate the risk of algal blooms to a certain extent thus understanding the long term variation in the particulate composition of water helps to evaluate lake water quality and environmental functions the laurentian great lakes are the world s largest water area approximately 244 160 km2 and having a drainage area of 765 990 km2 johns 2017 historically climate warming human activities and economic development have gradually caused the deterioration of the ecological environment of the great lakes binding et al 2007 millie et al 2009 smith et al 2020 the great lakes have increasingly faced water quality problems due to a huge population explosion in the basin de pinto et al 1986 in the past 200 years the population living in the great lakes basin has increased from approximately 300 000 to 105 million wang et al 2012 in the mid to late 1960s serious eutrophication problems in the lower reaches of the great lakes were recorded in particular some parts of lake michigan and lake huron have attracted wide attention from many scientists de pinto et al 1986 schelske claire et al 1983 harmful algal blooms have been observed recently despite strict regulatory policies michalak et al 2013 in recent years remote sensing technology has been widely used to monitor long term changes in water quality in the great lakes binding et al 2012 son and wang 2019 wynne et al 2010 based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris the interannual bloom intensity in western lake erie since 2002 was quantified stumpf et al 2016 stumpf et al 2012 son and wang 2019 analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in turbidity in the great lakes since 2012 based on visible infrared imager radiometer suite images and the results showed that the seasonal patterns of lake superior michigan huron and ontario were apparently different from those of lake erie similarly the variations in chla and transparency in the great lakes since 2012 were also analyzed and there was strong interannual variation in most of the great lakes son and wang 2020 water clarity results monitored by multiple sensors showed that there was an increasing trend in lake ontario huron and michigan while clarity in lake superior remained stable over three sensor periods 1978 1985 1998 2004 2005 2014 binding et al 2015 however studies that only focus on the concentration of a single water quality parameter cannot fully explain the changes in optical properties and water quality of the great lakes assessing long term changing characteristics of particulate composition in the great lakes basin will help to understand changes in primary production sediment transport and carbon cycling in the great lakes however there is still a lack of an assessment of the particulate composition characteristics of the great lakes regarding the characterization of particulate composition wozniak et al 2010 adopted the ratio of particulate organic carbon poc to tss for the particulate composition characteristics in the nearshore marine environment at imperial beach california neukermans et al 2012 quantified particulate composition as the ratio of poc to the sum of poc and particulate inorganic carbon pic in coastal and offshore waters around europe similarly chla tss has also been widely applied to characterize particulate composition neukermans et al 2016 sun et al 2013 woźniak et al 2022 xue et al 2020 chla tss is a parameter that can be estimated relatively accurately using remote sensing techniques and it characterizes the proportion of phytoplankton in total suspended solids here chla tss a parameter often used to characterize the composition of organic and inorganic particles was used to study the particulate composition of the great lakes the purposes of this study were to 1 calibrate and validate the developed chla tss estimation algorithm for the laurentian great lakes 2 obtain the spatial and temporal variation patterns of chla tss in the great lakes over the past 20 years and 3 improve our understanding of the factors causing the spatial temporal changes in particulate composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 in situ dataset the dataset collected from three public datasets was used to calibrate and validate the particulate composition estimation algorithm the reflectance data of the pixel corresponding to the latitude and longitude within the same day as the measured data were extracted 544 match ups were sorted out of which 2 3 n 363 of the data were used to calibrate the algorithm and the remaining 1 3 n 181 was used to validate the algorithm the distribution of the three datasets is shown in

reflectance rrc is obtained by removing gaseous absorption and rayleigh scattering effects in seadas 7 5 cao et al 2017 pixels with rrc 1640 greater than 0 0215 were considered cloud pixels and masked liu et al 2021 modis images from 2000 to 2020 were used to map the chla tss of the great lakes in addition images during the freezing period were excluded and annual averages were calculated using images from april to october each year fig 2 shows the temporal distribution of modis images used in this study a total of 5549 images for the great lakes were selected 2 3 chla tss estimation algorithm a semianalytical algorithm xu22 for chla tss estimation was selected for the great lakes xu et al 2022 based on the significant correlations between phytoplankton absorption coefficient aph λ and chla and between backscattering coefficient bb λ and tss aph λ bb λ was applied to estimate chla tss especially at 650 700 nm according to the modis band settings aph 678 bb 678 was applied for the great lakes furthermore to obtain the relationship between aph 678 bb 678 and reflectance another wavelength λ2 that can ignore aph λ2 was chosen here λ2 748 nm two other existing semianalytical algorithms xue20 xue et al 2020 sun13 sun et al 2013 and an empirical algorithm to indirectly calculate chla tss based on estimated chla and tss were selected for comparison the coefficients of the algorithms were calibrated via the calibration dataset 2 4 environmental data era5 land is a replay of the land component of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era5 climate reanalysis model muñoz sabater 2019 grid monthly average data of temperature precipitation wind speed runoff and snowmelt from 2000 2020 were selected with a spatial resolution of 0 1 the monthly average temperature and wind speed over these examined lakes were extracted to calculate the annual average values monthly average precipitation runoff and snowmelt from the drainage basin for each lake were used to calculate the annual average values and the basin boundary was determined based on the data from sciencebase https www sciencebase gov the european space agency climate change initiative land cover product cci lc provides global annual land cover data from 1982 to the present at a resolution of 300 m http maps elie ucl ac be cci according to the land categories defined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the categories in cci lc cci lc data were grouped into 6 types cropland forest grassland wetland settlement and others changes in the proportions of five major land use types cropland forest grassland wetland and settlement from the drainage basin for each lake from 2000 to 2020 were applied to analyze the drivers of change in the particulate composition in lakes 2 5 statistical analysis and accuracy assessment the nonparametric mann kendall mk test was adopted to determine the change trend of the chla tss from 2000 2020 in the great lakes li et al 2020 the z value statistic was used to represent the monotonic trend of time series data a value of z 0 indicates an increasing trend while z 0 indicates a decreasing trend according to the results of the mk test at the 0 05 significance level z 1 96 was determined as a significance change and z 1 96 was labeled as an insignificant change linear regression was performed to obtain the change rate through the annual chla tss series du et al 2022 correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between environmental variables and particulate composition multiple general linear model glm analyses were adopted to calculate the relative contributions of environmental factors tao et al 2015 the variance inflation factor was used to exclude collinear variables the significance level was labeled significant p 0 05 or not significant p 0 05 the accuracy of the estimation algorithm was assessed by unbiased mean absolute percent error umape root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse as shown in eqs 1 3 1 umape 1 n i 1 n x i y i 0 5 x i y i 100 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 3 nrmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 max x i min x i 100 where xi and yi are the in situ measurement and estimation values from rrc λ respectively 3 results 3 1 the calibration and validation of the chla tss estimation algorithm the accuracy comparison of the four algorithms is listed in table 1 the performance of xu22 algorithm was significantly better than two semianalytical algorithms xue20 and sun13 and an empirical algorithm for indirect estimation of chla tss with the highest consistency r2 0 54 the smallest rmse 0 66 µg mg nrmse 13 44 and umape 34 69 further the scatterplots of estimated values and measured chla tss of the xu22 algorithm with the best performance are displayed in fig 3 although there was an overestimation at low values the estimated and measured chla tss were approximately distributed along a 1 1 line indicating that the xu22 algorithm was acceptable for estimating particulate composition in the great lakes two sites with long term chla tss records we4 in lake erie and sb1 in saginaw bay were adopted to further evaluate the robustness of the xu22 algorithm for long term monitoring and the observed trends from modis data and the measured values are shown in fig 4 the observation frequency from modis data was higher than that from in situ chla tss measurements visually the modis derived chla tss compared well with the in situ chla tss values modis derived chla tss showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing from may to october which was consistent with the pattern observed from measured chla tss data however it was also unfortunate that some extremely high values were not captured by modis observations 3 2 spatial distribution characterization of chla tss the chla tss derived from modis data during the period from 2000 to 2020 was averaged to characterize the chla tss spatial distribution in the great lakes as illustrated in fig 5 a lake superior had the highest average chla tss values 5 79 0 76 µg mg followed by lake huron 5 19 0 91 µg mg lake michigan 4 99 0 65 µg mg and lake ontario 4 45 0 42 µg mg while lake erie had the lowest average chla tss values 2 93 0 76 µg mg of the three regions of eutrophication in the great lakes chla tss of western erie was the smallest 2 33 0 72 µg mg followed by saginaw bay 2 96 1 27 µg mg and the chla tss in green bay was the largest 4 16 0 86 µg mg specifically the chla tss gradually increased from the west to the east of lake erie there was no obvious difference in the spatial distribution of lake ontario which was only slightly higher in the east in lake huron the chla tss values in saginaw bay and around st mary s river were lower than those in the central area and georgian bay the chla tss of green bay in lake michigan was lower than that in the offshore area lake superior showed extremely high chla tss in most areas with only relatively low values of chla tss in black bay and nipigon bay in the north the spatial distribution of the standard deviation of the interannual variation was calculated to represent the spatial heterogeneity of chla tss variation as shown in fig 5b the largest chla tss variations were observed in western lake superior southern michigan and southern huron in contrast the changes in chla tss in lake erie and ontario were small with s d 0 35 µg mg this result suggested that there were significant variability differences not only among the five lakes but also within the lake 3 3 long term changing characteristics of chla tss in the great lakes the average annual change trend from 2000 to 2020 is described in fig 6 the interannual variation characteristics of chla tss between two adjacent lakes with hydrological flow were more similar in lake erie the interannual variation characteristics of chla tss were similar to those in lake huron and ontario with correlation coefficients r of 0 60 p 0 01 and 0 77 p 0 01 respectively however the changing trend in chla tss in lake erie was different from the changes in lake michigan and superior with a relatively low correlation coefficient especially in lake superior where the correlation coefficient was only 0 23 p 0 05 the ratio of chla tss in lake erie and ontario both remained at a relatively low level during 2002 2012 and increased rapidly from 2012 in particular the chla tss in the western erie was the smallest in 2003 and had maintained a high value since 2006 similarly the chla tss values in lake huron michigan and superior all had the lowest values in 2003 and peaked in 2004 and 2013 for the two eutrophic regions saginaw bay and green bay the chla tss reached a minimum in 2003 and a maximum in 2015 and 2011 respectively the mk test was applied to find the change trend of chla tss and the results showed that the chla tss of the five lakes presented an increasing trend during 2000 2020 especially in lake michigan showing a significant upward trend z 1 96 the annual average chla tss change rate in lake michigan was the largest rising at a rate of 0 0564 µg mg yr followed by lake ontario and huron with 0 0316 µg mg yr and 0 024 µg mg yr respectively in addition regionally western erie and green bay showed significant trends increasing at rates of 0 0248 µg mg yr and 0 046 µg mg yr respectively while saginaw bay showed no significant upward trend z 1 96 compared to the 2000s the mean values of chla tss in the five lakes increased in the 2010s the spatial distribution of the chla tss change trend and change rate during the period from 2000 to 2020 for the great lakes is shown in fig 7 overall 35 21 of the pixels in the great lakes showed a significant increase in chla tss but only 3 73 of the pixels exhibited a significant decrease specifically 44 24 of the pixels in lake erie presented a significant increase in chla tss from 2000 to 2020 mainly located in the western and central parts of lake erie these pixels rose at a rate of 0 036 µg mg yr a total of 38 24 of the pixels in lake huron increased significantly with an interannual change rate of 0 065 µg mg yr located in northern lake huron and saginaw bay the significantly increased pixels accounted for 88 23 of lake michigan covering nearly the entire lake and the interannual variation rate of these pixels even reached 0 087 µg mg yr in some instances however nearly 90 of the pixels in lake ontario and superior had a weak interannual trend of increasing or decreasing which was not statistically significant 4 discussion 4 1 the evaluation of algorithm performance in this study the performance of xu22 algorithm was better than other three algorithms thus it was applied for chla tss estimation of the great lakes the dataset used in this study was collected from 2000 to 2020 and covered four seasons the collected dataset covered a large range with chla ranging from 0 4 to 101 44 µg l tss from 0 5 to 75 4 mg l and chla tss from 0 08 to 9 6 µg mg which helped to strengthen the robustness of the algorithm meanwhile the validation results demonstrated that despite the overestimation of chla tss in the range of 0 1 µg mg the estimation accuracy of xu22 algorithm with a umape of 35 03 rmse of 0 65 µg mg and nrmse of 14 64 was acceptable compared to some previous studies sun et al 2013 xu et al 2022 xue et al 2020 however it was still necessary to collect more regional datasets to calibrate and validate the algorithm the temporal applicability of the algorithm was essential to determine whether such an algorithm was suitable for long term monitoring of water quality fig 3 shows that the temporal trend obtained through the in situ monitoring site was consistent with the temporal variation derived through remote sensing monitoring son and wang 2019 reported that the turbidity of lake michigan and lake huron showed an obvious decreasing trend which indicated an apparent decrease in tss to a certain extent furthermore there was evidence of a significant increase in chla concentration in lake michigan and a decrease in phytoplankton production in lake huron barbiero et al 2011 son and wang 2020 therefore a significant increasing trend of chla tss in lake michigan and a nonsignificant increasing trend in lake huron could be derived based on their research which is consistent with our results obtained in lake michigan and huron in both lake erie and superior there were no evident changes in chla concentration and transparency son and wang 2020 which is in line with our result of insignificant variation in chla tss retrieved by modis images in addition the slight changes in lake ontario and lake superior between 2001 and 2011 found in this research have also been reported by other studies binding et al 2015 reavie et al 2014 4 2 the environmental driving factors for the chla tss changing pattern 4 2 1 the environmental driving factors for intra annual variation in chla tss temperature wind speed precipitation and runoff are often considered to be the main factors affecting the changes in suspended particulate matter in lakes hill et al 2000 michalak et al 2013 shi et al 2015 xu et al 2021 the glm regression results shown in fig 8 showed that the above four environmental factors could explain 71 47 92 54 of the variation in the monthly average chla tss of the great lakes indicating that changes in climatic and hydrological conditions dominated the intra annual variation of chla tss specifically temperature explained more than 24 of the intra annual variation in chla tss in two lakes at relatively low latitudes lake erie and ontario furthermore the influence of temperature on the chla tss in the great lakes was mainly from january to june with a correlation coefficient greater than 0 61 and the increase of temperature promoted the increase of phytoplankton liu et al 2011 robarts and zohary 1987 however as shown in fig 9 chla tss showed a second peak in september or october while the temperature continued to decrease suggesting that temperature may no longer be the dominant factor during this period the second peak in chla tss corresponded to peaks in precipitation lake michigan and ontario or troughs in wind speed lake erie huron and superior with correlation more than 0 58 indicating that wind speed and rainfall might be more important for chla tss changes since july the contribution of wind speed to the monthly variation of chla tss was 21 49 6 06 on the one hand low wind speed was more conducive to phytoplankton floating and nutrient release deng et al 2020 on the other hand sediment resuspension was weak at low wind speed xu et al 2021 which explained the negative correlation between wind speed and chla tss our results indicated that only the monthly mean runoff in lake huron had a large contribution to chla tss which could explain 27 77 of the variation moreover precipitation which affects runoff was positively correlated with chla tss with a contribution of 25 73 16 10 especially in lake michigan the contribution of precipitation could reach 51 35 increased precipitation not only reduces tss concentration lei et al 2020 xue et al 2020 but also could bring nutrients into lakes to promote phytoplankton growth tong and chen 2002 xu et al 2021 in addition changes in the frequency and timing of snowmelt events can greatly alter the timing of runoff into the great lakes suriano and leathers 2017 snowmelt generally only occurs in a certain month or months between january and april suriano and leathers 2017 the increase in snowmelt led to a decrease in the tss concentration and brought more nutrients into lakes for example in lake ontario the average snowmelt in march reached 0 0017 m of water equivalent and the chla tss in march increased by 27 37 compared with that in february moreover due to the difference in latitude of the five lakes the peak of snowmelt in most of the basin occurs in march while the peak of snowmelt near lake superior occurs in april suriano and leathers 2017 which sometimes resulted in higher chla tss in april than in may in lake superior 4 2 2 the relationship between interannual variation in chla tss and environmental variables according to 4 2 1 it could be concluded that climatic and hydrological conditions collaboratively affect the monthly variation of chla tss in the great lakes further glm was applied to analyze the contribution of 10 variables such as temperature precipitation and land use to the interannual chla tss as shown in fig 10 glm results demonstrated that the contribution of wind speed to chla tss was small no more than 9 21 the annual average runoff precipitation and snowmelt all contributed significantly to the interannual chla tss indicating that the input from land sources was an important reason for the variation in chla tss in lake superior where human activities was sparse temperature contributed 28 94 to the annual chla tss variation in contrast in lake erie ontario michigan and huron land use had a more significant impact on chla tss with a contribution rate greater than 33 85 in the great lakes basin land use types varied widely among the five subbasins the lake erie watershed was dominated by cropland while forest accounted for more than 82 in the lake superior watershed meanwhile in the past 20 years the developed landscape cropland settlement in the five subbasins has been increasing while the natural landscape has been decreasing and this changing pattern was found to be consistent with the increasing trend of the chla tss in the five lakes the contribution of the developed landscape to the interannual variation in chla tss in the great lakes could reach 46 43 with the increase of settlement in the watershed the positive effect of settlement on chla tss was gradually significant the correlation coefficient changed from 0 11 p 0 05 to 0 47 p 0 05 from lake superior where the average annual percentage of settlement was only 0 24 to lake erie with an annual average of 7 77 the increase in settlement is associated with nutrient enrichment in lakes stimulating phytoplankton production and biomass michael beman et al 2005 tong and chen 2002 in addition erosion of urban riverbeds would lead to a reduction in sediment flow into lakes le et al 2015 therefore the increase in settlement in the great lakes basin would lead to an increase in chla tss interestingly cropland exhibited a negative correlation with chla tss in lake erie 0 48 and michigan 0 15 but a slight positive correlation in the remaining three lakes li et al 2020 found that the relationship between cropland and water quality varied with regional scale agricultural fertilization produces a large amount of nutrients lee et al 2009 but the large amount of cropland also increases the risk of soil erosion shi et al 2017 therefore it has two sided effect on the ratio of chla tss especially in the lake erie basin where the cropland area exceeded 70 the contribution of cropland to the interannual chla tss could reach 27 39 furthermore the relationship between cropland and chla tss might be affected by local geographic conditions climate etc dai et al 2017 the images used in this study to calculate the annual mean chla tss were collected from april to october when was the time of the most precipitation in the great lakes basin precipitation has the potential to increase the probability of soil erosion in cropland ding et al 2016 shi et al 2017 thereby affecting the particulate composition in the lake in an indirect way the contribution ratio of the natural landscape forest grassland wetland to the interannual variation in chla tss ranged from 7 20 to 18 86 in different lakes the natural landscape was negatively correlated with chla tss with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 11 p 0 05 to 0 46 p 0 05 which agreed well with the previous finding across gulf coast estuaries le et al 2015 the interception of surface runoff by plant roots enables forests and grasslands to effectively reduce the nutrient loadings required for phytoplankton growth moreno et al 2006 ouyang et al 2010 potentially resulting in a reduction in chla tss in addition the residual contributions ranged from 3 01 to 51 09 in the five lakes indicating the possibility of other unconsidered factors such as mussel invasion or policy governance affecting the interannual change in chla tss binding et al 2015 du et al 2022 4 3 the relationship between particulate composition and algal blooms in western lake erie eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems has become a serious problem due to increased anthropogenic nutrient loadings liu et al 2019 michalak et al 2013 smith 2003 western lake erie has experienced a recurrence of dense cyanobacterial blooms since the 2000s stumpf et al 2016 the years of 2003 2004 and 2008 2011 were considered to be bloom years in lake erie ho and michalak 2015 especially 2011 which experienced extremely serious harmful algal blooms stumpf et al 2012 blooms in western lake erie usually peak in late august or early september ho and michalak 2015 wynne and stumpf 2015 xue et al 2020 found that particulate composition could indicate the risk of eutrophication and algal blooms in inland lakes as displayed in fig 11 since 2002 when frequent algal blooms were observed in this year the chla tss in the spring and in november and december of the previous year were significantly lower than those in the years with no frequent algal bloom reoccurrence 2000 and 2001 with a mean chla tss of 2 16 µg mg in addition in the year with severe algal blooms the value of chla tss in one month before the algal bloom often showed a significantly low value thus if the chla tss in western lake erie was significantly lower in november and december of the previous year and the spring of that year the possibility of algal blooms in that year needs to be considered a large amount of nutrients produced by agricultural activities in spring in the western lake erie watershed entered the lake with the sediment providing the nutrients needed for algae growth making the western lake erie meet the necessary conditions of large algal biomass michalak et al 2013 stumpf et al 2012 therefore in summer when the weather conditions and other factors were suitable algal blooms would occur furthermore if the chla tss in one month suddenly drops significantly during the rapid algal growth in the summer of that year it meant that a large amount of suspended sediment appears on the water surface in addition to further promoting the growth of phytoplankton by the nutrients carried by the suspended sediment the accumulation of sediment affects the light attenuation of the underwater light field he et al 2017 lei et al 2020 due to the demand of phytoplankton for light the movement of phytoplankton to regions with stronger light fields regions with higher chla tss leads to the local mass accumulation of phytoplankton klausmeier and litchman 2001 thus special attention should be given to the possibility of severe blooms in the next month the spatial relationship between algal blooms and changes in particulate composition was also analyzed fig 12 illustrates the spatial distribution of chla tss during an algal bloom event in western lake erie from october 2 to 9 2011 the location where the bloom occurred was tightly fitted to the outside of the plume the wind speed in the bay was obviously lower than that outside the bay which is theoretically more suitable for the accumulation of algal blooms wang et al 2022 however algal blooms were rarely seen in the bay furthermore from the spatial distribution of algal blooms on october 6 and october 7 even if the wind blew into the bay southeast wind the algal blooms expanded minimally into the bay mouth with lower chla tss furthermore it can be seen from the image on october 2 in fig 12b that sporadic algal blooms occurred at both p1 and p2 locations interestingly the algal blooms at the p1 location did not spread and lasted for only two days while the bloom at the p2 location continued until october 9th the chla tss ratio near p1 was significantly lower than that near p2 according to the image comparison of the same time on october 4 16 30 gmt and october 6 16 20 gmt the high values near p1 on the 6th were more scattered and more eastward than on the 4th it can be inferred that due to the influence of the surrounding large scale high scattering substances at p1 the phytoplankton may not obtain enough light conditions and move to the farther p2 position with the combined effect of the wind the relationship between changes in the spatial distribution of blooms and chla tss during the period of algal blooms provide support for the prediction of bloom locations in the next few days 5 conclusions 1 compared with xue20 sun13 and an empirical indirect algorithm xu22 was more robust in estimating chla tss in the great lakes 2 the chla tss in the great lakes showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2020 especially in lake michigan increasing at a rate of 0 0564 µg mg yr 3 climatic and hydrological conditions dominated the intra annual variation of chla tss in the great lakes explaining 71 47 92 45 of the variation in monthly mean chla tss on the interannual scale the contribution of temperature was prominent in lake superior and changes in land use were more likely to explain the interannual variability of chla tss in lake erie ontario michigan and huron than climate and hydrological changes 4 the chla tss in spring in bloom years in western lake erie was significantly lower than that in nonbloom years declaration of competing interest the authors

15686,particulate composition provides important information for understanding the changes in underwater light fields and primary productivity in this study a semianalytical algorithm based on rayleigh corrected reflectance at 678 nm and 748 nm on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis images was used to estimate the ratio of chlorophyll a to total suspended solids chla tss which characterizes the particulate composition of the great lakes the long term spatial and temporal characteristics of chla tss in the great lakes from 2000 to 2020 were obtained the results demonstrated that lake superior had the highest average chla tss values 5 79 0 76 µg mg while lake erie had the lowest average chla tss values 2 93 0 76 µg mg the mann kendall test showed that the chla tss of the great lakes all showed an increasing trend notably in lake michigan with 88 23 pixels showing significant increasing trend climatic and hydrological factors dominated the intra annual variation of chla tss with contribution rates ranging from 71 47 to 92 54 through the annual chla tss change pattern analysis it was found that the contribution of wind speed to the annual variation in chla tss was slight changes in temperature played a major role in the interannual variability of chla tss in lake superior and ontario runoff and settlement were the major contributors in lake huron and michigan while cropland dominated the chla tss interannual variability in lake erie furthermore the significantly low values of chla tss in spring had the potential to predict the occurrence of blooms in western lake erie and the spatial distribution of chla tss could help predict the location of blooms in the next few days graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords particulate composition chla tss great lakes modis influencing factors data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction particulate composition is a key factor in determining the refractive index and it affects the underwater light field wozniak et al 2010 xue et al 2020 inconsistent optical properties will be observed with different particulate compositions under the same particulate concentration astoreca et al 2012 woźniak et al 2022 the increase in the proportion of organic particles will lead to a decrease in the refractive index and a decrease in the backscattering ratio twardowski et al 2001 whitmire et al 2007 the change in the underwater light field leads to a change in the photosynthesis efficiency which further influences the primary productivity and significantly affects the aquatic ecological environment furthermore organic and inorganic particles impact aquatic ecosystems in different ways kratzer et al 2020 liu et al 2019 a study xue et al 2020 has shown that particulate composition can reflect the process of eutrophication and indicate the risk of algal blooms to a certain extent thus understanding the long term variation in the particulate composition of water helps to evaluate lake water quality and environmental functions the laurentian great lakes are the world s largest water area approximately 244 160 km2 and having a drainage area of 765 990 km2 johns 2017 historically climate warming human activities and economic development have gradually caused the deterioration of the ecological environment of the great lakes binding et al 2007 millie et al 2009 smith et al 2020 the great lakes have increasingly faced water quality problems due to a huge population explosion in the basin de pinto et al 1986 in the past 200 years the population living in the great lakes basin has increased from approximately 300 000 to 105 million wang et al 2012 in the mid to late 1960s serious eutrophication problems in the lower reaches of the great lakes were recorded in particular some parts of lake michigan and lake huron have attracted wide attention from many scientists de pinto et al 1986 schelske claire et al 1983 harmful algal blooms have been observed recently despite strict regulatory policies michalak et al 2013 in recent years remote sensing technology has been widely used to monitor long term changes in water quality in the great lakes binding et al 2012 son and wang 2019 wynne et al 2010 based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris the interannual bloom intensity in western lake erie since 2002 was quantified stumpf et al 2016 stumpf et al 2012 son and wang 2019 analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in turbidity in the great lakes since 2012 based on visible infrared imager radiometer suite images and the results showed that the seasonal patterns of lake superior michigan huron and ontario were apparently different from those of lake erie similarly the variations in chla and transparency in the great lakes since 2012 were also analyzed and there was strong interannual variation in most of the great lakes son and wang 2020 water clarity results monitored by multiple sensors showed that there was an increasing trend in lake ontario huron and michigan while clarity in lake superior remained stable over three sensor periods 1978 1985 1998 2004 2005 2014 binding et al 2015 however studies that only focus on the concentration of a single water quality parameter cannot fully explain the changes in optical properties and water quality of the great lakes assessing long term changing characteristics of particulate composition in the great lakes basin will help to understand changes in primary production sediment transport and carbon cycling in the great lakes however there is still a lack of an assessment of the particulate composition characteristics of the great lakes regarding the characterization of particulate composition wozniak et al 2010 adopted the ratio of particulate organic carbon poc to tss for the particulate composition characteristics in the nearshore marine environment at imperial beach california neukermans et al 2012 quantified particulate composition as the ratio of poc to the sum of poc and particulate inorganic carbon pic in coastal and offshore waters around europe similarly chla tss has also been widely applied to characterize particulate composition neukermans et al 2016 sun et al 2013 woźniak et al 2022 xue et al 2020 chla tss is a parameter that can be estimated relatively accurately using remote sensing techniques and it characterizes the proportion of phytoplankton in total suspended solids here chla tss a parameter often used to characterize the composition of organic and inorganic particles was used to study the particulate composition of the great lakes the purposes of this study were to 1 calibrate and validate the developed chla tss estimation algorithm for the laurentian great lakes 2 obtain the spatial and temporal variation patterns of chla tss in the great lakes over the past 20 years and 3 improve our understanding of the factors causing the spatial temporal changes in particulate composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 in situ dataset the dataset collected from three public datasets was used to calibrate and validate

liu et al 2021 modis images from 2000 to 2020 were used to map the chla tss of the great lakes in addition images during the freezing period were excluded and annual averages were calculated using

λ and chla and between backscattering coefficient bb λ and tss aph λ bb λ was applied to estimate chla tss especially at 650 700 nm according to the modis band settings aph 678 bb 678 was applied for the great lakes furthermore to obtain the relationship between aph 678 bb 678 and reflectance another wavelength λ2 that can ignore aph λ2 was chosen here λ2 748 nm two other existing semianalytical algorithms xue20 xue et al 2020 sun13 sun et al 2013 and an empirical algorithm to indirectly calculate chla tss based on estimated chla and tss were selected for comparison the coefficients of the

composition in lakes 2 5 statistical analysis and accuracy assessment the nonparametric mann kendall mk test was adopted to determine the change trend of the chla tss from 2000 2020 in the great lakes li et al 2020 the z value statistic was used to represent the monotonic trend of time series data a value of z 0 indicates an increasing trend while z 0 indicates a decreasing trend according to the results of the mk test at the 0 05 significance level z 1 96 was determined as a significance change and z 1 96 was labeled as an insignificant change linear regression was performed to obtain the change rate through the annual chla tss series du et al 2022 correlation analysis was used to investigate the relationship between environmental variables and particulate composition multiple general linear model glm analyses were adopted to calculate the relative contributions of environmental factors tao et al 2015 the variance inflation factor was used to exclude collinear variables the significance level was labeled significant p 0 05 or not significant p 0 05 the accuracy of the estimation algorithm was assessed by unbiased mean absolute percent error umape root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse as shown in eqs 1 3 1 umape 1 n i 1 n x i y i 0 5 x i y i 100 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 3 nrmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 max x i min x i 100 where xi and yi are the in situ measurement and estimation values from rrc λ respectively 3 results 3 1 the calibration and validation of the chla tss estimation algorithm the accuracy comparison of the four algorithms is listed in table 1 the performance of xu22 algorithm was significantly better than two semianalytical algorithms xue20 and sun13 and an empirical algorithm for indirect estimation of chla tss with the highest consistency r2 0 54 the smallest rmse 0 66 µg mg nrmse 13 44 and umape 34 69 further the scatterplots of estimated values and measured chla tss of the xu22 algorithm with the best performance are displayed in fig 3 although there was an overestimation at low values the estimated and measured chla tss were approximately distributed along a 1 1 line indicating that the xu22 algorithm was acceptable for estimating particulate composition in the great lakes two sites with long term chla tss records we4 in lake erie and sb1 in saginaw bay were adopted to further evaluate the robustness of the xu22 algorithm for long term monitoring and the observed trends from modis data and the measured values are shown in fig 4 the observation frequency from modis data was higher than that from in situ chla tss measurements visually the modis derived chla tss compared well with the in situ chla tss values modis derived chla tss showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing from may to october which was consistent with the pattern observed from measured chla tss data however it was also unfortunate that some extremely high values were not captured by modis observations 3 2 spatial distribution characterization of chla tss the chla tss derived from modis data during the period from 2000 to 2020 was averaged to characterize the chla tss spatial distribution in the great lakes as illustrated in fig 5 a lake superior had the highest average chla tss values 5 79 0 76 µg mg followed by lake huron 5 19 0 91 µg mg lake michigan 4 99 0 65 µg mg and lake ontario 4 45 0 42 µg mg while lake erie had the lowest average chla tss values 2 93 0 76 µg mg of the three regions of eutrophication in the great lakes chla tss of western erie was the smallest 2 33 0 72 µg mg followed by saginaw bay 2 96 1 27 µg mg and the chla tss in green bay was the largest 4 16 0 86 µg mg specifically the chla tss gradually increased from the west to the east of lake erie there was no obvious difference in the spatial distribution of lake ontario which was only slightly higher in the east in lake huron the chla tss values in saginaw bay and around st mary s river were lower than those in the central area and georgian bay the chla tss of green bay in lake michigan was lower than that in the offshore area lake superior showed extremely high chla tss in most areas with only relatively low values of chla tss in black bay and nipigon bay in the north the spatial distribution of the standard deviation of the interannual variation was calculated to represent the spatial heterogeneity of chla tss variation as shown in fig 5b the largest chla tss variations were observed in western lake superior southern michigan and southern huron in contrast the changes in chla tss in lake erie and ontario were small with s d 0 35 µg mg this result suggested that there were significant variability differences not only among the five lakes but also within the lake 3 3 long term changing characteristics of chla tss in the great lakes the average annual change trend from 2000 to 2020 is described in fig 6 the interannual variation characteristics of chla tss between two adjacent lakes with hydrological flow were more similar in lake erie the interannual variation characteristics of chla tss were similar to those in lake huron and ontario with correlation coefficients r of 0 60 p 0 01 and 0 77 p 0 01 respectively however the changing trend in chla tss in lake erie was different from the changes in lake michigan and superior with a relatively low correlation coefficient especially in lake superior where the correlation coefficient was only 0 23 p 0 05 the ratio of chla tss in lake erie and ontario both remained at a relatively low level during 2002 2012 and increased rapidly from 2012 in particular the chla tss in the western erie was the smallest in 2003 and had maintained a high value since 2006 similarly the chla tss values in lake huron michigan and superior all had the lowest values in 2003 and peaked in 2004 and 2013 for the two eutrophic regions saginaw bay and green bay the chla tss reached a minimum in 2003 and a maximum in 2015 and 2011 respectively the mk test was applied to find the change trend of chla tss and the results showed that the chla tss of the five lakes presented an increasing trend during 2000 2020 especially in lake michigan showing a significant upward trend z 1 96 the annual average chla tss change rate in lake michigan was the largest rising at a rate of 0 0564 µg mg yr followed by lake ontario and huron with 0 0316 µg mg yr and 0 024 µg mg yr respectively in addition regionally western erie and green bay showed significant trends increasing at rates of 0 0248 µg mg yr and 0 046 µg mg yr respectively while saginaw bay showed no significant upward trend z 1 96 compared to the 2000s the mean values of chla tss in the five lakes increased in the 2010s the spatial distribution of the chla tss change trend and change rate during the period from 2000 to 2020 for the great lakes is shown in fig 7 overall 35 21 of the pixels in the great lakes showed a significant increase in chla tss but only 3 73 of the pixels exhibited a significant decrease specifically 44 24 of the pixels in lake erie presented a significant increase in chla tss from 2000 to 2020 mainly located in the western and central parts of lake erie these pixels rose at a rate of 0 036 µg mg yr a total of 38 24 of the pixels in lake huron increased significantly with an interannual change rate of 0 065 µg mg yr located in northern lake huron and saginaw bay the significantly increased pixels accounted for 88 23 of lake michigan covering nearly the entire lake and the interannual variation rate of these pixels even reached 0 087 µg mg yr in some instances however nearly 90 of the pixels in lake ontario and superior had a weak interannual trend of increasing or decreasing which was not statistically significant 4 discussion 4 1 the evaluation of algorithm performance in this study the performance of xu22 algorithm was better than other three algorithms thus it was applied for chla tss estimation of the great lakes the dataset used in this study was collected from 2000 to 2020 and covered four seasons the collected dataset covered a large range with chla ranging from 0 4 to 101 44 µg l tss from 0 5 to 75 4 mg l and chla tss from 0 08 to 9 6 µg mg which helped to strengthen the robustness of the algorithm meanwhile the validation results demonstrated that despite the overestimation of chla tss in the range of 0 1 µg mg the estimation accuracy of xu22 algorithm with a umape of 35 03 rmse of 0 65 µg mg and nrmse of 14 64 was acceptable compared to some previous studies sun et al 2013 xu et al 2022 xue et al 2020 however it was still necessary to collect more regional datasets to calibrate and validate the algorithm the temporal applicability of the algorithm was essential to determine whether such an algorithm was suitable for long term monitoring of water quality fig 3 shows that the temporal trend obtained through the in situ monitoring site was consistent with the temporal variation derived through remote sensing monitoring son and wang 2019 reported that the turbidity of lake michigan and lake huron showed an obvious decreasing trend which indicated an apparent decrease in tss to a certain extent furthermore there was evidence of a significant increase in chla concentration in lake michigan and a decrease in phytoplankton production in lake huron barbiero et al 2011 son and wang 2020 therefore a significant increasing trend of chla tss in lake michigan and a nonsignificant increasing trend in lake huron could be derived based on their research which is consistent with our results obtained in lake michigan and huron in both lake erie and superior there were no evident changes in chla concentration and transparency son and wang 2020 which is in line with our result of insignificant variation in chla tss retrieved by modis images in addition the slight changes in lake ontario and lake superior between 2001 and 2011 found in this research have also been reported by other studies binding et al 2015 reavie et al 2014 4 2 the environmental driving factors for the chla tss changing pattern 4 2 1 the environmental driving factors for intra annual variation in chla tss temperature wind speed precipitation and runoff are often considered to be the main factors affecting the changes in suspended particulate matter in lakes hill et al 2000 michalak et al 2013 shi et al 2015 xu et al 2021 the glm regression results shown in fig 8 showed that the above four environmental factors could explain 71 47 92 54 of the variation in the monthly average chla tss of the great lakes indicating that changes in climatic and hydrological conditions dominated the intra annual variation of chla tss specifically temperature explained more than 24 of the intra annual variation in chla tss in two lakes at relatively low latitudes lake erie and ontario furthermore the influence of temperature on the chla tss in the great lakes was mainly from january to june with a correlation coefficient greater than 0 61 and the increase of temperature promoted the increase of phytoplankton liu et al 2011 robarts and zohary 1987 however as shown in fig 9 chla tss showed a second peak in september or october while the temperature continued to decrease suggesting that temperature may no longer be the dominant factor during this period the second peak in chla tss corresponded to peaks in precipitation lake michigan and ontario or troughs in wind speed lake erie huron and superior with correlation more than 0 58 indicating that wind speed and rainfall might be more important for chla tss changes since july the contribution of wind speed to the monthly variation of chla tss was 21 49 6 06 on the one hand low wind speed was more conducive to phytoplankton floating and nutrient release deng et al 2020 on the other hand sediment resuspension was weak at low wind speed xu et al 2021 which explained the negative correlation between wind speed and chla tss our results indicated that only the monthly mean runoff in lake huron had a large contribution to chla tss which could explain 27 77 of the variation moreover precipitation which affects runoff was positively correlated with chla tss with a contribution of 25 73 16 10 especially in lake michigan the contribution of precipitation could reach 51 35 increased precipitation not only reduces tss concentration lei et al 2020 xue et al 2020 but also could bring nutrients into lakes to promote phytoplankton growth tong and chen 2002 xu et al 2021 in addition changes in the frequency and timing of snowmelt events can greatly alter the timing of runoff into the great lakes suriano and leathers 2017 snowmelt generally only occurs in a certain month or months between january and april suriano and leathers 2017 the increase in snowmelt led to a decrease in the tss concentration and brought more nutrients into lakes for example in lake ontario the average snowmelt in march reached 0 0017 m of water equivalent and the chla tss in march increased by 27 37 compared with that in february moreover due to the difference in latitude of the five lakes the peak of snowmelt in most of the basin occurs in march while the peak of snowmelt near lake superior occurs in april suriano and leathers 2017 which sometimes resulted in higher chla tss in april than in may in lake superior 4 2 2 the relationship between interannual variation in chla tss and environmental variables according to 4 2 1 it could be concluded that climatic and hydrological conditions collaboratively affect the monthly variation of chla tss in the great lakes further glm was applied to analyze the contribution of 10 variables such as temperature precipitation and land use to the interannual chla tss as shown in fig 10 glm results demonstrated that the contribution of wind speed to chla tss was small no more than 9 21 the annual average runoff precipitation and snowmelt all contributed significantly to the interannual chla tss indicating that the input from land sources was an important reason for the variation in chla tss in lake superior where human activities was sparse temperature contributed 28 94 to the annual chla tss variation in contrast in lake erie ontario michigan and huron land use had a more significant impact on chla tss with a contribution rate greater than 33 85 in the great lakes basin land use types varied widely among the five subbasins the lake erie watershed was dominated by cropland while forest accounted for more than 82 in the lake superior watershed meanwhile in the past 20 years the developed landscape cropland settlement in the five subbasins has been increasing while the natural landscape has been decreasing and this changing pattern was found to be consistent with the increasing trend of the chla tss in the five lakes the contribution of the developed landscape to the interannual variation in chla tss in the great lakes could reach 46 43 with the increase of settlement in the watershed the positive effect of settlement on chla tss was gradually significant the correlation coefficient changed from 0 11 p 0 05 to 0 47 p 0 05 from lake superior where the average annual percentage of settlement was only 0 24 to lake erie with an annual average of 7 77 the increase in settlement is associated with nutrient enrichment in lakes stimulating phytoplankton production and biomass michael beman et al 2005 tong and chen 2002 in addition erosion of urban riverbeds would lead to a reduction in sediment flow into lakes le et al 2015 therefore the increase in settlement in the great lakes basin would lead to an increase in chla tss interestingly cropland exhibited a negative correlation with chla tss in lake erie 0 48 and michigan 0 15 but a slight positive correlation in the remaining three lakes li et al 2020 found that the relationship between cropland and water quality varied with regional scale agricultural fertilization produces a large amount of nutrients lee et al 2009 but the large amount of cropland also increases the risk of soil erosion shi et al 2017 therefore it has two sided effect on the ratio of chla tss especially in the lake erie basin where the cropland area exceeded 70 the contribution of cropland to the interannual chla tss could reach 27 39 furthermore the relationship between cropland and chla tss might be affected by local geographic conditions climate etc dai et al 2017 the images used in this study to calculate the annual mean chla tss were collected from april to october when was the time of the most precipitation in the great lakes basin precipitation has the potential to increase the probability of soil erosion in cropland ding et al 2016 shi et al 2017 thereby affecting the particulate composition in the lake in an indirect way the contribution ratio of the natural landscape forest grassland wetland to the interannual variation in chla tss ranged from 7 20 to 18 86 in different lakes the natural landscape was negatively correlated with chla tss with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 11 p 0 05 to 0 46 p 0 05 which agreed well with the previous finding across gulf coast estuaries le et al 2015 the interception of surface runoff by plant roots enables forests and grasslands to effectively reduce the nutrient loadings required for phytoplankton growth moreno et al 2006 ouyang et al 2010 potentially resulting in a reduction in chla tss in addition the residual contributions ranged from 3 01 to 51 09 in the five lakes indicating the possibility of other unconsidered factors such as mussel invasion or policy governance affecting the interannual change in chla tss binding et al 2015 du et al 2022 4 3 the relationship between particulate composition and algal blooms in western lake erie eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems has become a serious problem due to increased anthropogenic nutrient loadings liu et al 2019 michalak et al 2013 smith 2003 western lake erie has experienced a recurrence of dense cyanobacterial blooms since the 2000s stumpf et al 2016 the years of 2003 2004 and 2008 2011 were considered to be bloom years in lake erie ho and michalak 2015 especially 2011 which experienced extremely serious harmful algal blooms stumpf et al 2012 blooms in western lake erie usually peak in late august or early september ho and michalak 2015 wynne and stumpf 2015 xue et al 2020 found that particulate composition could indicate the risk of eutrophication and algal blooms in inland lakes as displayed in fig 11 since 2002 when frequent algal blooms were observed in this year the chla tss in the spring and in november and december of the previous year were significantly lower than those in the years with no frequent algal bloom reoccurrence 2000 and 2001 with a mean chla tss of 2 16 µg mg in addition in the year with severe algal blooms the value of chla tss in one month before the algal bloom often showed a significantly low value thus if the chla tss in western lake erie was significantly lower in november and december of the previous year and the spring of that year the possibility of algal blooms in that year needs to be considered a large amount of nutrients produced by agricultural activities in spring in the western lake erie watershed entered the lake with the sediment providing the nutrients needed for algae growth making the western lake erie meet the necessary conditions of large algal biomass michalak et al 2013 stumpf et al 2012 therefore in summer when the weather conditions and other factors were suitable algal blooms would occur furthermore if the chla tss in one month suddenly drops significantly during the rapid algal growth in the summer of that year it meant that a large amount of suspended sediment appears on the water surface in addition to further promoting the growth of phytoplankton by the nutrients carried by the suspended sediment the accumulation of sediment affects the light attenuation of the underwater light field he et al 2017 lei et al 2020 due to the demand of phytoplankton for light the movement of phytoplankton to regions with stronger light fields regions with higher chla tss leads to the local mass accumulation of phytoplankton klausmeier and litchman 2001 thus special attention should be given to the possibility of severe blooms in the next month the spatial relationship between algal blooms and changes in particulate composition was also analyzed fig 12 illustrates the spatial distribution of chla tss during an algal bloom event in western lake erie from october 2 to 9 2011 the location where the bloom occurred was tightly fitted to the outside of the plume the wind speed in the bay was obviously lower than that outside the bay which is theoretically more suitable for the accumulation of algal blooms wang et al 2022 however algal blooms were rarely seen in the bay furthermore from the spatial distribution of algal blooms on october 6 and october 7 even if the wind blew into the bay southeast wind the algal blooms expanded minimally into the bay mouth with lower chla tss furthermore it can be seen from the image on october 2 in fig 12b that sporadic algal blooms occurred at both p1 and p2 locations interestingly the algal blooms at the p1 location did not spread and lasted for only two days while the bloom at the p2 location continued until october 9th the chla tss ratio near p1 was significantly lower than that near p2 according to the image comparison of the same time on october 4 16 30 gmt and october 6 16 20 gmt the high values near p1 on the 6th were more scattered and more eastward than on the 4th it can be inferred that due to the influence of the surrounding large scale high scattering substances at p1 the phytoplankton may not obtain enough light conditions and move to the farther p2 position with the combined effect of the wind the relationship between changes in the spatial distribution of blooms and chla tss during the period of algal blooms provide support for the prediction of bloom locations in the next few days 5 conclusions 1 compared with xue20 sun13 and an empirical indirect algorithm xu22 was more robust in estimating chla tss in the great lakes 2 the chla tss in the great lakes showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2020 especially in lake michigan increasing at a rate of 0 0564 µg mg yr 3 climatic and hydrological conditions dominated the intra annual variation of chla tss in the great lakes explaining 71 47 92 45 of the variation in monthly mean chla tss on the interannual scale the contribution of temperature was prominent in lake superior and changes in land use were more likely to explain the interannual variability of chla tss in lake erie ontario michigan and huron than climate and hydrological changes 4 the chla tss in spring in bloom years in western lake erie was significantly lower than that in nonbloom years declaration of competing interest the authors

15687,the presence of heavy metals alters the colloidal stability and deposition of nanoplastics nps in urban waters such processes are important to assess the mobility and fate of nps and their associated heavy metals up to date few studies have reported the impact of heavy metals on the colloidal behaviors of nps and the involved mechanisms in the study time resolved dynamic light scattering dls and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d methods were used to assess the aggregation and deposition kinetics of polystyrene nanospheres with divalent heavy metals for comparison carboxyl modified polystyrene nanospheres were used results reveal that heavy metals destabilized nps more significantly than calcium ions spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis propose that heavy metals destabilized nps via inner sphere coordination with carboxyl groups and cation π interactions further leading to the formation of different dimensional aggregates qcm d results suggest that the deposition rate irreversibility and film compactness of nps on silica surfaces first increased but further decreased as heavy metal concentration increased such deposition behaviors depended on the bridging effects between nps and silica and aggregation induced diffusion limitation in that case the destabilization and retention ability of heavy metals for nps were related to their electronegativity and hydration shell thickness in urban waters the presence of natural organic matter nom decreased the destabilization and retention ability of heavy metals whereas heavy metals with environmentally relevant concentrations still enhanced the aggregation and deposition of nps compared with other environmental cations this study highlights the impact of heavy metal property on the colloidal behaviors of nps thus deepening our understanding of the mobility and fate of nps associated with heavy metals in urban waters graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics aggregation deposition qcm d heavy metals urban water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the production of plastics including polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps exceeds 300 million tons per year most of which are ultimately released into natural environments barnes et al 2009 wright and kelly 2017 nanoplastics nps commonly referring to plastic debris less than 100 nm in diameter are a major class of emerging persistent contaminants alimi et al 2018 gigault et al 2016 lehner et al 2019 primary nps such as exfoliant beads in personal care products and cleansers inevitably enter the waste stream hernandez et al 2017 while secondary nps originate from the breakage of bulk plastics due to aging processes such as mechanical abrasion radiation and biological degradation da costa et al 2016 ter halle et al 2016 nps discharged from wastewater are an important source of plastic debris for example it is estimated that 8 trillion pieces of plastic debris in effluents penetrate wastewater treatment plants wwtp and enter the aquatic systems rochman et al 2015 the small size and high mobility of nps result in low removal efficiency of nps in filter systems carr et al 2016 horton et al 2017 liu et al 2018 in addition sewage sludge containing nps can be discharged into agricultural soils as biosolids murphy et al 2016 wei et al 2019 the nps discharged from wwtps cause a serious biotoxicity and bioaccumulation risk zhu et al 2020a furthermore due to their strong adsorption capabilities nps act as carriers for other pollutants in wastewater including organic chemicals e g polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons liu et al 2018 and heavy metals brennecke et al 2016 as a result the enhanced mobility and transport of chemicals in aquatic systems improve their environmental risks chen et al 2018 ren et al 2021 therefore it is essential to evaluate the mobility and fate of nps associated with co occurring pollutants in urban water as well as their environmental risks the colloidal stability and deposition are important processes affecting the mobility and fate of such nps associated with contaminants alimi et al 2018 da costa et al 2016 these processes are significantly influenced by the environmental background and the surface chemistry of nps particle particle attachment efficiency and the aqueous aggregation of nps significantly increase with increasing monovalent and divalent ionic strength owing to charge screening or bridging effects liu et al 2019c shams et al 2020 aging under uv radiations and oxidation alters the colloidal stability of nps by strengthening the surface negative charges or enhancement in bridging effects liu et al 2019c wang et al 2020 moreover the presence of naturally occurring organic macromolecules in water significantly affects the colloidal stability of nps via intermolecular surface charge accumulation or steric hindrance shams et al 2020 xu et al 2021 unlike the aggregation in bulk solution the deposition behavior represents the environmental process of np approaching onto collector surfaces such as grain in the wwtp system dai et al 2016 huangfu et al 2018 qcm d system has previously been applied to probe this deposition process of nps quevedo and tufenkji 2012 due to the suppression of the electrical double layer the deposition of nps increases with the particle collector attachment efficiency alimi et al 2018 xu et al 2021 early studies revealed the colloidal behaviors and deposition of nps followed the dlvo theory and schulze hardy rule derjaguin and landau 1993 elimelech et al 2013 however contaminants in urban water such as polar organic compounds and heavy metals will change the colloidal behaviors of nps via specific interactions that could not be explained by the dlvo theory or schulze hardy rule liu et al 2019a wang et al 2021 yan et al 2021 for example a recent study found that the presence of dissolved black carbon in water enhanced the deposition of nps due to specific π π interactions xu et al 2021 which was in contrast to the impact of humic acid according with the dlvo theory therefore the effect of specific interactions of nps with co occurring contaminants in urban water on their colloidal stability and deposition requires careful and comprehensive investigation heavy metals e g cd ii cu ii pb ii and zn ii are primary pollutants in urban water with a high sorption affinity for nps through coulombic force ion exchange and other specific interactions brennecke et al 2016 holmes et al 2012 shen et al 2021 therefore nps are considered as potential carriers in wwtp systems to improve the mobility and environmental risks of heavy metals compared to environmental cations heavy metals affect the colloidal stability and deposition of nanomaterials in water in different ways due to the specific interactions for example compared to na or ca2 heavy metals with the same valence state significantly enhance the aggregation and retention of nanomaterials in a porous medium xia et al 2017 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2016 this phenomenon was related to hofmeister s effects and some specific interactions yang et al 2016 zhang and cremer 2006 these interactions are different for different heavy metals varying in hydration shells or electronegativity however the impacts of interaction mechanisms with heavy metals on the stability of nps and formation of aggregates remains unclear despite that the sorption affinities of nps have been extensively reported but little is known about the property and concentration of heavy metals that determine the deposition and mobility of nps these gaps lead to bias in understanding the fate of nps associated with heavy metals in urban water this study hypothesizes that the aqueous aggregation and deposition of nps with heavy metals differ from typical environmental cations due to the specific interactions associated with the properties of heavy metals and np surface characteristics in the study we investigate the aqueous aggregation kinetics of fresh and carboxyl modified ps nanospheres in the presence of common environmental cations nacl and cacl2 and heavy metals pb ii cu ii cd ii and zn ii via time resolved dynamic light scattering dls measurements polystyrene nps are used as representative nps due to their large production e g up to multiple million tons and widespread occurrence in waters in addition the coexisting aromatic rings and acidic groups in polystyrene polymer are favorable to explore their mechanisms of aggregation and deposition carboxyl modified ps is also used to compare the involved mechanisms four heavy metals pb ii cu ii cd ii and zn ii are selected for analysis as they are commonly detected in urban wastewater fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir is employed to study the specific interactions while transmission electron microscopy tem is used to observe the microscopic configurations of np aggregates a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d system and in situ force spectra in atomic force microscope afm are used to investigate the deposition kinetics of nps in the presence of heavy metals and viscoelastic properties of the deposition layer formed on the silica surface the different urban waters with environmentally relevant concentrations of heavy metals were used to identify the stability of nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemical agents fresh polyethylene nanospheres fnps and carbonylated polyethylene nanospheres cnps were purchased from hugebio technology company shanghai china a large portion of plastic debris present in water does not retain its initial chemical state and exhibits different colloidal behaviors carboxyl groups are acidic moieties that are dominantly present on plastic surfaces during aging liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c song et al 2017 three different

environmentally relevant heavy metals 0 5 mm pb or 0 4 mm zn were present in the three waters the components in such waters approached to those around the industrial sites in urban systems all other

mixed with 1 mm heavy metals for more than 2 h then freeze dried and stored for tem analysis the heavy metal concentration and pretreatment time ensured the complete aggregation of nps 2 3 aggregation kinetics aqueous aggregation kinetics were determined by dls measurements for kinetic experiments 1 ml np suspensions were sonicated and a constant mass of divalent heavy metals was added to the suspension to obtain cation concentrations from 0 1 to 30 mm this concentration range was used to compare the difference between the destabilized abilities of various heavy metals in addition the urban waters containing the heavy metals with environmentally relevant concentrations were also used the ph of suspensions in the presence and absence of cations was maintained at around 6 8 using 0 1 m hcl or naoh to ensure the heavy metals were not hydrolyzed the added acid or base solutions did not exceed 2 μl to avoid affecting the ionic strength the 1 ml nps suspensions with a specific concentration of cations were transferred to a quartz cuvette and immediately placed in the dls cell to monitor the intensity weighted average particle hydrodynamic diameter d h at 30 second intervals the aggregation experiments were repeated three times and standard deviations sd were obtained in addition the hamaker constants and dlvo interactions were determined and shown in text s2 and s3 si the initial aggregation rate constants of colloids were proportional to the increasing rate of d h over time eq 1 chen and elimelech 2006 in this study the initial aggregation rate was determined by the linear increase in d h over the time from t 0 to that when d h reached 1 5 d h the attachment efficiency α was determined as the initial rate of nps aggregation and normalized according to the rate of aggregation under diffusion limited conditions eq 2 chen and elimelech 2006 as a result the α value was calculated as the initial slope of increase in d h at a specific cation concentration and normalized to the initial slope under fast aggregation conditions 1 k a 1 n 0 d d h t dt t 0 2 α 1 w k k fast 1 n 0 d d h t dt t 0 1 n 0 fast d d h t dt t 0 fast where n0 represents the colloidal number concentration 2 4 deposition and release experiments using qcm d the deposition and release kinetics of nps colloids on a silica surface were investigated by a qcm d system q sense explorer biolin scientific ab sweden equipped with a crystal sensor sio2 qsx 303 the quartz sensor was pretreated before each experiment jin et al 2021 before deposition experiments the crystal sensor sio2 qsx 303 was preconditioned as followings 1 uv ozone treatment for 10 min 2 immersing the sensor surfaces in 2 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solution for 30 min 3 keeping wet surface and rinsing with milli q water 4 drying under a nitrogen atmosphere 5 another 10 minute uv ozone treatment the electrolyte solutions as background fluids were first injected into the qcm d system chamber at a specific flow rate of 0 1 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump reglo digital ism 596 ismatec switzerland before injecting the samples di water was used as background fluid to stabilize the system until the normalized third overtone frequency shift δf 3 was less than 0 3 hz in 10 min the nps suspensions with constant heavy metal concentrations were prepared as test solutions different heavy metal cations coexisted in the injection flow at varying concentrations in some cases backgrounding cations and nom coexisted in solutions the tested solutions were injected into the chamber and the real time frequency shift δf and energy dissipation δd of samples were recorded the δf and δd represented the deposited mass and viscoelastic characteristics of nps on the silica surface especially f d ratios were calculated to probe the deposition film characteristics when sample deposition reached equilibrium the injection flow was switched to milli q water to release the nps associated with heavy metals from the deposited layer the changes in δf due to elution represented the release percentage the deposition experiments were repeated three times and standard deviations sd were obtained to further explore the interactions with silica the afm as well as a colloidal probe were used to probe the force spectra details of afm tests have been shown in text s4 si 3 results and discussions 3 1 structural properties of nps tem images and dls results fig s1 and s3 showed that both fnps and cnps exhibited spherical morphology with particle sizes of 100 nm the zeta potential ζ mv of cnps was 53 mv fig s2a significantly higher than that of fnps 48 mv indicating that the carboxyl groups on cnps were dissociated at ph 6 8 and attained additional negative charge and a larger hydration shell chen et al 2015 liu et al 2019c the high ζ of both fnps and cnps i e less than 40 mv indicated their high aqueous colloidal stability chowdhury et al 2015 li et al 2008 the smaller contact angles θ glycerol of cnps table s1 indicated its higher hydrophilicity due to the higher content of acidic groups ftir results fig s2b showed that the absorbance peak of both fnps and cnps at 1600 1620 cm 1 corresponded to c c stretching while peaks at 1490 and 1451 cm 1 were attributed to monosubstituted aromatic vibrations gong et al 2022 xu et al 2021 bands at 754 and 711 cm 1 represented aromatic ch vibrations conforming to the presence of polyethylene polymer luo et al 2019 a broad peak at 1700 1725 cm 1 corresponding to c o stretching guan et al 2006 kaiser and guggenberger 2000 yang et al 2016 appeared in cnps spectra but not in fnps ftir results confirmed that carboxyl groups were not initially present on fnps they were successfully introduced to cnps during modification xrd results fig s2c showed the peaks at 18 6 represented the crystalline domains in polymer chains of polyethylene sarkar et al 2021 in addition the results from raman spectra fig s2d suggested that the characteristic peaks at 620 793 1000 1157 1448 and 1600 cm 1 represented the ring stretching ch cc stretching modes as well as the main structures of polyethylene nps sobhani et al 2019 3 2 aggregation kinetics of fresh and carboxyl modified nps 3 2 1 aggregation in nacl and cacl2 solutions aggregation profiles of fnps and cnps were established in nacl and cacl2 electrolyte solutions as shown in fig s3 and s4 the d h of fnps and cnps were significantly improved with increasing nacl and cacl2 concentrations the α values of fnps and cnps representing the probability of collisions resulting in attachment to the total number of collisions improved and approached unity with increasing electrolyte concentration fig 1 for example when the nacl concentration increased from 40 mm to 200 mm the α of fnps correspondingly increased from 0 05 to 0 98 according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory colloidal aggregation followed the reaction limited and diffusion limited regions alimi et al 2018 derjaguin and landau 1993 lin et al 1989 wang et al 2013 an α value of less than 1 indicated that repulsive forces in nps colloids dominated the reaction limited regime while the α value approached unity because the energy barrier of the electrostatic double layer edl of nps was eliminated allowing mass transfer to dominate the diffusion limited regime the ccc values were obtained from aggregation profiles representing the minimum electrolyte concentration where colloids were destabilized and α reached unity fig 1 it was observed that the cccca values for both fnps and cnps were significantly lower than the corresponding cccna values suggesting that ca2 exhibited a greater destabilized ability since divalent cations possessed a higher charge density to neutralize negative charges than monovalent cations huangfu et al 2013 liu et al 2019c the aggregation profiles of both fnps and cnps were significantly different in nacl and cacl2 electrolytes in a diffusion limited regime k fast the fast aggregation rates of cnps in nacl and cacl2 solutions were 1 9 and 2 3 nm s 1 respectively and both were significantly higher than those of fnps fig s3 and s4 these results suggested that cnps contained more favorable and reactive sites for cation attachment during aggregate formation moreover the cccna of cnps 780 mm was significantly higher than that of fnps 320 mm fig 1a whereas the cccca of cnps 20 mm was lower than that of fnps 80 mm fig 1b this inverse trend in ccc values of fnps and cnps was attributed to the differences in aggregation mechanisms of na and ca2 especially na improved the aqueous aggregation of nps only by suppressing the edl and decreasing the electrostatic repulsion among colloids therefore compared to fnps the greater negative charge of cnps required a higher na concentration to suppress the edl and induce aggregate formation however except for charge neutralization divalent ca2 was favorable to enhancing cnps aggregation by bridging with carboxyl groups liu et al 2019c qu et al 2010 therefore the observed differences in the aqueous aggregation of cnps and fnps depended on the edl suppression and specific interactions such as bridging effects 3 2 2 aggregation in divalent heavy metal solutions aggregation kinetics of fnps and cnps with heavy metals were significantly different from na or ca2 results showed that heavy metals achieved the aggregation of both fnps and cnps at lower solution concentrations than na or ca2 fig s5 and s6 for example both fnps and cnps formed aggregates of more than 600 nm in solutions containing less than 10 mm of heavy metals as a result the ccc values of all heavy metals for fnps and cnps were significantly lower these results indicated that the widespread occurrence of heavy metals as ubiquitous contaminants in urban water significantly promoted the destabilization of aqueous plastic debris in addition the ccc values of heavy metals for cnps were all lower than those of fnps indicating that cnps was more thermodynamically unstable than fnps in the presence of heavy metals as specific interactions dominated the aggregation mechanism fnps and cnps exhibited different aggregation kinetics in the presence of different heavy metal cations when the cation concentrations were below 2 mm pb ii and cu ii induced obvious cnps aggregation whereas the d h of cnps did not change with cd ii and zn ii figs 2 a and b the ccc values of heavy metals were ranked in the following order figs 2c and d cccpb 7 5 mm ccccu 10 mm ccccd 15 5 mm ccczn 28 mm for fnps and cccpb 2 8 mm ccccu 4 mm ccccd 7 4 mm ccczn 8 9 mm for cnps under similar conditions the electrophoretic mobility of nps decreased kinetically and was different in the presence of various heavy metals fig s7 according to the dlvo theory cations with the same valency should exhibit similar capabilities to neutralize surface negative charges it is observed that the negative ζ of fnps and cnps both increased significantly as increasing heavy metal concentration fig s8 whereas the changes in ζ varied for different divalent heavy metals fig 3 a and b the increase in ζ was ranked in the following order pb ii cu ii cd ii zn ii consistent with the observed trend in ccc values dlvo calculation results fig s9 also showed that the energy barriers of nps were different among the four heavy metals suggesting the abilities of different heavy metals to pass through the edl were significantly distinct previous studies demonstrated that specific interactions such as inner sphere coordination between cations and oxygen containing groups on carbonaceous polymers penetrate the edl and neutralize surface negative charges more effectively than outer sphere interactions pham et al 2009 xia et al 2017 based on the schulze hardy rule the ccchm to cccna ratios should range from z 2 to z 6 considering that spherical colloids were well dispersed without specific interactions elimelech et al 2013 petosa et al 2010 in the present study the ccchm to cccna ratios were all lower than z 6 collectively these results indicated that different edl suppression capacities of divalent heavy metals induced the observed differences in ccc values this variation in charge screening occurred due to specific interactions rather than electrostatic forces when the specific interactions were related to chemical bonding the differences in the ccc value of heavy metals with varying atomic properties were expected 3 2 3 mechanism of aqueous nps aggregation with heavy metals ftir was used to explore the specific interactions between nps and heavy metal cations in the presence of heavy metals the broad absorption peak at 1725 cm 1 c o stretching exhibited a significant shift in cnps spectra fig 3c for example in the presence of pb ii and zn ii cations the peak at 1725 cm 1 shifted to 1767 and 1745 cm 1 respectively in addition in the presence of pb ii the appearance of an adsorption peak at 1235 cm 1 in cnps spectra corresponded to co me bonds vibrations with carboxylates attributed to the formation of bidentate mononuclear ligands guan et al 2006 kaiser and guggenberger 2000 these results indicated that heavy metal cations interacted with nps via inner sphere coordination liu et al 2019c yang et al 2016 the complexation with heavy metals favored high energy sites such as carboxyl groups and further led to the aggregation of nps in that case the cnps with more carboxy groups provided more reactive sites than fnps as a result cnps showed lower ccc values than fnps furthermore the absorption peaks at 1604 cm 1 and 1495 1425 cm 1 representing monosubstituted benzenes vibration within aromatic π delocalized systems gong et al 2022 xu et al 2021 shifted obviously in the presence of heavy metals for instance the absorption peak at 1604 cm 1 shifted to 1598 and 1623 cm 1 in the presence of pb ii and zn ii cations respectively suggesting that heavy metal cations changed the vibration energy of c c stretching and conjugated with π delocalized systems of nps via cation π interactions yang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 such interactions passed through edl and promoted the charge screening by heavy metals to destabilize the nps the differences in the ccc value of heavy metals are also reasonably explained dipole water molecules around the outer shell of heavy metal cations extend the interaction distance with acidic groups or benzene rings thereby lowering the bonding energy xu et al 2005 yang et al 2016 this process is consistent with the hofmeister effect in which cations with a larger atomic radius and thinner hydration shells can more favorably undergo inner sphere coordination xia et al 2017 in the present study the hydration shell thickness of heavy metal cations was ranked in the following order pb 2 83 å cu 3 25 å cd 3 41 å zn 3 49 å nightingale jr 1959 it is known that weakly hydrated heavy metals can more favorably form bridges and aggregate with plastic debris via inner sphere interactions however it was observed that despite cu exhibiting a lower ccc value its hydration shell thickness 3 25 å was larger than that of ca 3 10 å this suggested that in addition to hydrated shell thickness other properties also affect the specific interactions of heavy metals the inner sphere coordination and cation π complexes followed donor acceptor and charge transfer interactions where energy was dependent on the electronegativity of cations over the aromatic plane center ma and dougherty 1997 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2016 it is thus proposed that the electronegativity of heavy metals reflecting the intrinsic electronic density and distribution determined their specific interactions with nps fig 3d showed that the electronegativities of heavy metals were different and negatively correlated with their ccc values indicating that heavy metals with higher electronegativity showed stronger interactions with nps further confirming their higher destabilized ability due to more significant edl suppression or bridging therefore it can be concluded that both the hydration shell thickness and electronegativity of heavy metals determined their specific interactions with nps and subsequently their aqueous aggregation 3 2 4 microcosmic configuration of nps aggregates with heavy metals tem imaging was used to observe changes in the microcosmic configuration of aqueous aggregates in the presence of heavy metals as shown in fig 4 in the presence of pb ii cnps first formed one dimensional 1d tube like structures via particle particle combination along a 1d axis fig 4a this deformation of cnps potentially occurred due to the bridging effect between heavy metals and surface carboxyl groups subsequently these 1d tube like colloids combined along another dimensional axis to form 2d edge to edge piece like aggregates fig 4b which further assembled to form large sandwich like aggregates via face to face interactions figs 4c and d via cation π interactions previous studies demonstrated that aromatic rings in carbonaceous polymers were stacked due to the π cation π structure duan et al 2012 yang et al 2016 in addition the results of raman spectra fig s10 further supported such mechanisms the intensity of peaks at around 1000 cm 1 of cnps significantly increased when the pb was present indicating the larger aggregates of nps formed with heavy metals xu et al 2020a the peak at 3050 cm 1 of nps representing the aromatic rings disappeared due to the strong binding of cation π interactions cole et al 2013 such observations suggested the spatial aggregates of nps grew along with the stacking of 3d face to face structures to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the configuration of aqueous nps aggregates with heavy metals and these novel findings may have a high significance in understanding the fate and mobility of plastic debris in aquatic environments 3 3 deposition kinetics of nps 3 3 1 deposition kinetics in divalent heavy metal solutions the deposition kinetics of fnps and cnps on a silica surface was tested by qcm d in the absence of heavy metals fnps and cnps were not deposited on the silica surface due to their negatively charged surface representative frequency shift δf curves for fnps and cnps were observed over time in the presence of 0 5 mm heavy metals as shown in figs s11 and s12 such deposition on the silica surface was partly attributed to the decreasing energy barrier against silica due to edl suppression by heavy metals in addition the divalent heavy metals bridged nps colloids and the silica surface via inner sphere coordination promoting their deposition these deposition processes included both fast and slow rate regions fig 5 a and b suggesting that nps deposited to form an initial layer while steric effects later inhibited the process after the accumulation of more aggregates eita 2011 xu et al 2020b deposition rates r d were determined to reveal the deposition attachment efficiency and mass transfer to the surface hwang et al 2013 yi and chen 2013 the r d of fnps and cnps in the presence of 0 5 mm heavy metals were ranked in the following order pb ii cu ii cd ii zn ii demonstrating a consistent trend to the ranked order of electronegativity this confirmed that the higher electronegativity of heavy metals led to the formation of stronger complexes between nps and the silica surface and a higher deposition rate the only exception was cu which exhibited a higher electronegativity than zn but showed a lower cnps deposition rate fig 5b this phenomenon can be explained as cu ii causing a faster cnps aggregation than zn ii resulting in the formation of larger nps aggregates with a lower diffusion coefficient and deposition rate following the stokes einstein equation overall these results suggest that the deposition of nps was determined by the electronegativity of heavy metals the r d of cnps was significantly higher than that of fnps as shown in fig 5 the carboxyl groups on cnps acted as reactive sites for complexation with heavy metals and deposition on the silica surface with increasing heavy metal concentrations the changes in r d were non monotonic following a bell shaped distribution figs 6 a and b for example the r d of fnps increased from 13 3 10 3 hz s 1 to 122 8 hz s 1 with increasing pb ii concentrations from 0 1 mm to 1 mm then decreased to 9 7 hz s 1 with a further increase in pb ii concentration to 10 mm similar trends were reported for the deposition of other nanoparticles huangfu et al 2018 hwang et al 2013 quevedo et al 2013 xu et al 2020b initial increases in heavy metal concentration enhanced edl suppression and bridging effects while further increases in heavy metal concentration yet hindered the combination of nps with silica due to the restriction of hydrated shells such mechanisms were supported by the results of atomic force microscope afm fig s13 adhesion forces between fnps and silica surface representing the interaction strength contributing to the deposition first increased but then decreased as increasing pb concentration from 0 to 10 mm this trend of changes in adhesion force was consistent with those in r d moreover the larger aggregation of fnps and cnps under higher heavy metal concentration fig 2 resulted in a decrease in mass transfer when this reduction in mass transfer outweighed the increased attachment of nps on the silica surface the r d value decreased accordingly similar to ccc the critical deposition concentration cdc refers to the minimum concentration at which the maximum r d is reached describing the effect of heavy metals on the deposition of nps the heavy metals cdc values for both fnps and cnps were ranked in the following order cdcpb cdccu cdccd cdczn negatively correlating with the electronegativity in addition the cdc values of heavy metals for cnps were lower than those for fnps as shown in figs 6a and b under low heavy metal concentration conditions i e below the cdc the attachment of nps onto silica was the dominant mechanism however under high heavy metal concentration conditions i e above the cdc the mass transfer of nps dominated and aggregation hindered the deposition of nps this mechanism also explained the observed phenomenon that when cation concentration was higher than the cdc the heavy metals with the stronger aggregation capability showed less deposition of both fnps and cnps figs 6a and b 3 3 2 release of nps from the silica surface with increasing heavy metal concentrations the release percentage of fnps and cnps initially decreased and then increased significantly figs 6c and d for example with an increase in pb ii concentration from 0 1 mm to 1 mm the release percentage of fnps and cnps initially decreased to zero from 32 1 and 33 5 respectively then increased to 100 these results suggested that the nps undergo irreversible deposition under low heavy metal concentration whereas detachment from the silica surface was more favorable under higher heavy metal concentrations this phenomenon was observed because the deposition onto the silica surface at low heavy metal concentrations largely depended on specific interactions with heavy metals more thermodynamically stable than non specific interactions coward et al 2018 wagai and mayer 2007 zhu et al 2020b however under high cation concentration nps were significantly aggregated and favored deposition via non specific interactions this is supported by previous studies revealing that the colloidal aggregation reduces the availability of reactive sites with aggregates interacting with mineral surfaces through van der waals forces huangfu et al 2018 liao et al 2017 it was also observed that heavy metals with higher electronegativity exhibited lower critical concentrations to reach the minimum release percentage this trend was consistent with that of the ccc and cdc for heavy metals suggesting that heavy metals with higher electronegativity were better able to combine irreversibly with nps and silica under low concentrations however higher concentrations of heavy metals with higher electronegativity resulted in more significant aggregation of nps thereby increasing the release of nps from the silica surface in addition the release percentages of cnps were lower than those of fnps suggesting that although cnps aggregated more significantly than fnps the high content of carboxyl groups on cnps still formed a strong complex with silica 3 3 3 viscoelastic properties of the deposition layer the viscoelastic properties of fnps and cnps deposition layers in the presence of heavy metals were also investigated the ratio of dissipation energy to frequency shift δd δf was calculated fig s14 the relatively high δd δf indicated a swollen and soft deposition layer while a relatively low δd δf suggested a rigid and compact layer huangfu et al 2018 jin et al 2021 xu et al 2020b with increasing heavy metal cation concentrations the δd δf values of both fnps and cnps initially decreased to a minimum level then increased significantly thereafter figs 7 a and b the slopes of δd versus δf were constant for fnps and cnps at low cation concentrations while an increasing trend was observed over time under high concentrations fig s14 these results are well explained by the mechanisms discussed above the initial deposition of nps on the silica surface relied on bridging with heavy metals via specific interactions these interactions were the atomic range force that penetrated the hydrated shell resulting in the formation of a compact layer on the silica surface however once an initial layer of nps was deposited across the reactive sites on the silica surface aggregates with extended structures gradually were developed and formed a soft deposition layer chowdhury et al 2015 furman et al 2013 hwang et al 2013 therefore under low heavy metal concentrations nps deposited as a primary compact layer through specific interactions when obvious np aggregation occurred these large aggregates were partially deposited onto the primary layer forming patches and loosening and swelling the deposition layer fig 7c similar to the trend observed for ccc and cdc heavy metals with higher electronegativity reached their minimum δd δf values at lower critical concentrations this phenomenon occurred because heavy metals with higher electronegativity preferentially formed bridges with nps via specific interactions leading to the formation of compact deposition layers moreover no significant differences in the δd δf values of fnps and cnps were observed suggesting that carboxyl groups on nps surfaces did not affect the viscoelastic properties of the deposition layer 3 4 colloidal behaviors of nps in urban waters different water matrix including heavy metal nom and also other ions were employed to explore the aggregation and deposition behavior of nps especially the heavy metal concentrations in waters were environmentally relevant natural organic matters nom commonly existed in urban waters and will affect the colloidal behaviors of nps significantly the aggregation and deposition rates of nps in water 1 and 2 including around 2 mg c l 1 nom and 0 4 mm pb were obviously decreased compared to those without nom fig 8 in particular the disaggregation of fnps in water 1 and 2 containing nom over time was observed though the initial its d h was high due to presence of heavy metals and extra ca2 the results suggested the nom as negatively charged macromolecules relieved the destabilization of nps due to association with heavy metals such phenomenon resulted from the facts that nom might improve the colloidal stability of nps via charge accumulation and steric hindrance huangfu et al 2013 xu et al 2021 it should also be noted that compared to that without heavy metals the waters with heavy metals still raised the destabilization of nps even though nom was present the results suggested that the presence of heavy metals with environmentally relevant concentrations will significantly affect the mobility of nps in real urban water systems it is also observed that the coexisting backgrounding ions not significantly changed the impacts of heavy metals cations for example the stability of nps in water 3 containing 0 3 mm zn and around 100 mm na and 45 mm ca2 approached to that in solution only containing zn fig 8 in addition the trends of destabilization in waters corresponded to above conclusions for instance the presence of pb in water 2 led to the aggregation of nps and resulted in the higher deposition rates and irreversibility than that of zn due its higher electronegativity furthermore the impacts of nom in waters on destabilization of cnps were more significant than fnps this result implied that the stability of nps associated heavy metals will be higher in urban waters over time 3 5 environmental implications in urban waters this study provides important insights into the aggregation and deposition of nps with heavy metals in urban waters our findings suggested that fresh ps nps could more effectively carry heavy metals in wwtp effluent while carboxyl modified ps nps associated with heavy metals settle enter the sewage sludges and are discharged as biosolids more easily the fate of nps associated with heavy metals in the aqueous solid interface depends on the tradeoff of attachment i e bridging by cations and mass transfer i e aggregation in addition experiments on urban water identified the enhanced effects of heavy metals on the destabilization and deposition of nps despite of coexistence of nom and backgrounding ions such information can be further used to assess and understand the mobility and fate of nps associated with contaminants in wwtp systems or natural environments it is also highlighted that sorption capacity alone may not be an effective standard to assess the change in mobility of pollutants carried by nps in addition the electronegativity or polarity properties of pollutants in urban water should be considered when evaluating the fate of nps associated with heavy metals or polar chemicals capable of specific interactions with nps as a potential water treatment approach the same principle can be used to design inorganic coagulants and collector grains for the removal of nps however this study is limited to the observations of destabilization of nps in urban waters and the deposition of nps on the silica surface further studies should be extended to the colloidal behaviors of nps in real urban water systems including more complex components and substrates for instance the microbes or other particles in urban waters should be considered to evaluate the stability of nps while the deposition of nps on the municipal sludge or fe mn oxides as substrates should also be further tested the selection of ps nps in the study was to explore the corresponding mechanisms whereas the real distribution and characters of nps in real urban waters should be further explored and more plastic types should also be evaluated to comprehensively explore the mobility and fate of nps associated with heavy metals 4 conclusions in this study 1 we probed the impacts of heavy metals varying with property on the aggregation of nano scale plastics in aqueous solutions and the involved interaction mechanisms while observed the microscopic configurations of np aggregates in the presence of heavy metals 2 we explored the deposition kinetics of nps in heavy metal containing urban water in addition the deposition irreversibility and deposition layer characteristics were studied since these processes are important in evaluating the fate of nps and are barely reported the main conclusions include 1 carboxyl groups enhanced the colloidal stability of ps nps in a monovalent electrolyte solution and improved the aggregation of ps nps in the presence of ca2 or heavy metals 2 the ccc values of heavy metals were an order of magnitude lower than those of environmental cations the electronegativity and ionic radii or hydration shell thickness of different heavy metals at the same valency state were used to determine differences in the aggregation kinetics of ps nps via specific interactions i e inner sphere coordination and cation π interactions 3 differences in the deposition of nps on the grain collector occurred due to variations in surface attachment and mass transfer relating to the electronegativity of heavy metals and the aggregation state of nps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

15687,the presence of heavy metals alters the colloidal stability and deposition of nanoplastics nps in urban waters such processes are important to assess the mobility and fate of nps and their associated heavy metals up to date few studies have reported the impact of heavy metals on the colloidal behaviors of nps and the involved mechanisms in the study time resolved dynamic light scattering dls and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d methods were used to assess the aggregation and deposition kinetics of polystyrene nanospheres with divalent heavy metals for comparison carboxyl modified polystyrene nanospheres were used results reveal that heavy metals destabilized nps more significantly than calcium ions spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis propose that heavy metals destabilized nps via inner sphere coordination with carboxyl groups and cation π interactions further leading to the formation of different dimensional aggregates qcm d results suggest that the deposition rate irreversibility and film compactness of nps on silica surfaces first increased but further decreased as heavy metal concentration increased such deposition behaviors depended on the bridging effects between nps and silica and aggregation induced diffusion limitation in that case the destabilization and retention ability of heavy metals for nps were related to their electronegativity and hydration shell thickness in urban waters the presence of natural organic matter nom decreased the destabilization and retention ability of heavy metals whereas heavy metals with environmentally relevant concentrations still enhanced the aggregation and deposition of nps compared with other environmental cations this study highlights the impact of heavy metal property on the colloidal behaviors of nps thus deepening our understanding of the mobility and fate of nps associated with heavy metals in urban waters graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastics aggregation deposition qcm d heavy metals urban water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the production of plastics including polyethylene pe and polystyrene ps exceeds 300 million tons per year most of which are ultimately released into natural environments barnes et al 2009 wright and kelly 2017 nanoplastics nps commonly referring to plastic debris less than 100 nm in diameter are a major class of emerging persistent contaminants alimi et al 2018 gigault et al 2016 lehner et al 2019 primary nps such as exfoliant beads in personal care products and cleansers inevitably enter the waste stream hernandez et al 2017 while secondary nps originate from the breakage of bulk plastics due to aging processes such as mechanical abrasion radiation and biological degradation da costa et al 2016 ter halle et al 2016 nps discharged from wastewater are an important source of plastic debris for example it is estimated that 8 trillion pieces of plastic debris in effluents penetrate wastewater treatment plants wwtp and enter the aquatic systems rochman et al 2015 the small size and high mobility of nps result in low removal efficiency of nps in filter systems carr et al 2016 horton et al 2017 liu et al 2018 in addition sewage sludge containing nps can be discharged into agricultural soils as biosolids murphy et al 2016 wei et al 2019 the nps discharged from wwtps cause a serious biotoxicity and bioaccumulation risk zhu et al 2020a furthermore due to their strong adsorption capabilities nps act as carriers for other pollutants in wastewater including organic chemicals e g polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons liu et al 2018 and heavy metals brennecke et al 2016 as a result the enhanced mobility and transport of chemicals in aquatic systems improve their environmental risks chen et al 2018 ren et al 2021 therefore it is essential to evaluate the mobility and fate of nps associated with co occurring pollutants in urban water as well as their environmental risks the colloidal stability and deposition are important processes affecting the mobility and fate of such nps associated with contaminants alimi et al 2018 da costa et al 2016 these processes are significantly influenced by the environmental background and the surface chemistry of nps particle particle attachment efficiency and the aqueous aggregation of nps significantly increase with increasing monovalent and divalent ionic strength owing to charge screening or bridging effects liu et al 2019c shams et al 2020 aging under uv radiations and oxidation alters the colloidal stability of nps by strengthening the surface negative charges or enhancement in bridging effects liu et al 2019c wang et al 2020 moreover the presence of naturally occurring organic macromolecules in water significantly affects the colloidal stability of nps via intermolecular surface charge accumulation or steric hindrance shams et al 2020 xu et al 2021 unlike the aggregation in bulk solution the deposition behavior represents the environmental process of np approaching onto collector surfaces such as grain in the wwtp system dai et al 2016 huangfu et al 2018 qcm d system has previously been applied to probe this deposition process of nps quevedo and tufenkji 2012 due to the suppression of the electrical double layer the deposition of nps increases with the particle collector attachment efficiency alimi et al 2018 xu et al 2021 early studies revealed the colloidal behaviors and deposition of nps followed the dlvo theory and schulze hardy rule derjaguin and landau 1993 elimelech et al 2013 however contaminants in urban water such as polar organic compounds and heavy metals will change the colloidal behaviors of nps via specific interactions that could not be explained by the dlvo theory or schulze hardy rule liu et al 2019a wang et al 2021 yan et al 2021 for example a recent study found that the presence of dissolved black carbon in water enhanced the deposition of nps due to specific π π interactions xu et al 2021 which was in contrast to the impact of humic acid according with the dlvo theory therefore the effect of specific interactions of nps with co occurring contaminants in urban water on their colloidal stability and deposition requires careful and comprehensive investigation heavy metals e g cd ii cu ii pb ii and zn ii are primary pollutants in urban water with a high sorption affinity for nps through coulombic force ion exchange and other specific interactions brennecke et al 2016 holmes et al 2012 shen et al 2021 therefore nps are considered as potential carriers in wwtp systems to improve the mobility and environmental risks of heavy metals compared to environmental cations heavy metals affect the colloidal stability and deposition of nanomaterials in water in different ways due to the specific interactions for example compared to na or ca2 heavy metals with the same valence state significantly enhance the aggregation and retention of nanomaterials in a porous medium xia et al 2017 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2016 this phenomenon was related to hofmeister s effects and some specific interactions yang et al 2016 zhang and cremer 2006 these interactions are different for different heavy metals varying in hydration shells or electronegativity however the impacts of interaction mechanisms with heavy metals on the stability of nps and formation of aggregates remains unclear despite that the sorption affinities of nps have been extensively reported but little is known about the property and concentration of heavy metals that determine the deposition and mobility of nps these gaps lead to bias in understanding the fate of nps associated with heavy metals in urban water this study hypothesizes that the aqueous aggregation and deposition of nps with heavy metals differ from typical environmental cations due to the specific interactions associated with the properties of heavy metals and np surface characteristics in the study we investigate the aqueous aggregation kinetics of fresh and carboxyl modified ps nanospheres in the presence of common environmental cations nacl and cacl2 and heavy metals pb ii cu ii cd ii and zn ii via time resolved dynamic light scattering dls measurements polystyrene nps are used as representative nps due to their large production e g up to multiple million tons and widespread occurrence in waters in addition the coexisting aromatic rings and acidic groups in polystyrene polymer are favorable to explore their mechanisms of aggregation and deposition carboxyl modified ps is also used to compare the involved mechanisms four heavy metals pb ii cu ii cd ii and zn ii are selected for analysis as they are commonly detected in urban wastewater fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir is employed to study the specific interactions while transmission electron microscopy tem is used to observe the microscopic configurations of np aggregates a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d system and in situ force spectra in atomic force microscope afm are used to investigate the deposition kinetics of nps in the presence of heavy metals and viscoelastic properties of the deposition layer formed on the silica surface the different urban waters with environmentally relevant concentrations of heavy metals were used to identify the stability of nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemical agents fresh polyethylene nanospheres fnps and carbonylated polyethylene nanospheres cnps were purchased from hugebio technology company shanghai china a large portion of plastic debris present in water does not retain its initial chemical state and exhibits different colloidal behaviors carboxyl groups are acidic moieties that are dominantly present on plastic surfaces during aging liu et al 2019a 2019b 2019c song et al 2017 three different urban waters were obtained water 1 contained 100 mm na and 2 mg c l 1 nom water 2 contained 100 mm na 45 mm ca2 and 2 mg c l 1 nom and water 3 only contained 100 mm na and 45 mm ca2 the environmentally relevant heavy metals 0 5 mm pb or 0 4 mm zn were present in the three waters the components in such waters approached to those around the industrial sites in urban systems all other chemicals and reagents were reagent grade with a purity of 99 aladdin ltd and all aqueous samples were prepared in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm 1 2 2 characterizations fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tensor 27 bruker germany was employed to explore the changes in surface functional groups of fnps and cnps in the presence of different heavy metals zeta potential and hydrodynamic properties of nps were monitored using a time resolved dynamic light scattering dls zetasizer nano malvern panalytical uk x ray diffraction xrd rigaku smartlab 9kw japan spectrometer was used to probe the crystallinity of nps contact angle analyzer dataphysics co germany was employed to explore the hydrophilic property details of determining the contact angles were shown in text s1 supplementary information si the morphology and aggregate conformations were characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem talos f200s fei us briefly to observe the aggregates the samples of nps were pre mixed with 1 mm heavy metals for more than 2 h then freeze dried and stored for tem analysis the heavy metal concentration and pretreatment time ensured the complete aggregation of nps 2 3 aggregation kinetics aqueous aggregation kinetics were determined by dls measurements for kinetic experiments 1 ml np suspensions were sonicated and a constant mass of divalent heavy metals was added to the suspension to obtain cation concentrations from 0 1 to 30 mm this concentration range was used to compare the difference between the destabilized abilities of various heavy metals in addition the urban waters containing the heavy metals with environmentally relevant concentrations were also used the ph of suspensions in the presence and absence of cations was maintained at around 6 8 using 0 1 m hcl or naoh to ensure the heavy metals were not hydrolyzed the added acid or base solutions did not exceed 2 μl to avoid affecting the ionic strength the 1 ml nps suspensions with a specific concentration of cations were transferred to a quartz cuvette and immediately placed in the dls cell to monitor the intensity weighted average particle hydrodynamic diameter d h at 30 second intervals the aggregation experiments were repeated three times and standard deviations sd were obtained in addition the hamaker constants and dlvo interactions were determined and shown in text s2 and s3 si the initial aggregation rate constants of colloids were proportional to the increasing rate of d h over time eq 1 chen and elimelech 2006 in this study the initial aggregation rate was determined by the linear increase in d h over the time from t 0 to that when d h reached 1 5 d h the attachment efficiency α was determined as the initial rate of nps aggregation and normalized according to the rate of aggregation under diffusion limited conditions eq 2 chen and elimelech 2006 as a result the α value was calculated as the initial slope of increase in d h at a specific cation concentration and normalized to the initial slope under fast aggregation conditions 1 k a 1 n 0 d d h t dt t 0 2 α 1 w k k fast 1 n 0 d d h t dt t 0 1 n 0 fast d d h t dt t 0 fast where n0 represents the colloidal number concentration 2 4 deposition and release experiments using qcm d the deposition and release kinetics of nps colloids on a silica surface were investigated by a qcm d system q sense explorer biolin scientific ab sweden equipped with a crystal sensor sio2 qsx 303 the quartz sensor was pretreated before each experiment jin et al 2021 before deposition experiments the crystal sensor sio2 qsx 303 was preconditioned as followings 1 uv ozone treatment for 10 min 2 immersing the sensor surfaces in 2 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solution for 30 min 3 keeping wet surface and rinsing with milli q water 4 drying under a nitrogen atmosphere 5 another 10 minute uv ozone treatment the electrolyte solutions as background fluids were first injected into the qcm d system chamber at a specific flow rate of 0 1 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump reglo digital ism 596 ismatec switzerland before injecting the samples di water was used as background fluid to stabilize the system until the normalized third overtone frequency shift δf 3 was less than 0 3 hz in 10 min the nps suspensions with constant heavy metal concentrations were prepared as test solutions different heavy metal cations coexisted in the injection flow at varying concentrations in some cases backgrounding cations and nom coexisted in solutions the tested solutions were injected into the chamber and the real time frequency shift δf and energy dissipation δd of samples were recorded the δf and δd represented the deposited mass and viscoelastic characteristics of nps on the silica surface especially f d ratios were calculated to probe the deposition film characteristics when sample deposition reached equilibrium the injection flow was switched to milli q water to release the nps associated with heavy metals from the deposited layer the changes in δf due to elution represented the release percentage the deposition experiments were repeated three times and standard deviations sd were obtained to further explore the interactions with silica the afm as well as a colloidal probe were used to probe the force spectra details of afm tests have been shown in text s4 si 3 results and discussions 3 1 structural properties of nps tem images and dls results fig s1 and s3 showed that both fnps and cnps exhibited spherical morphology with particle sizes of 100 nm the zeta potential ζ mv of cnps was 53 mv fig s2a significantly higher than that of fnps 48 mv indicating that the carboxyl groups on cnps were dissociated at ph 6 8 and attained additional negative charge and a larger hydration shell chen et al 2015 liu et al 2019c the high ζ of both fnps and cnps i e less than 40 mv indicated their high aqueous colloidal stability chowdhury et al 2015 li et al 2008 the smaller contact angles θ glycerol of cnps table s1 indicated its higher hydrophilicity due to the higher content of acidic groups ftir results fig s2b showed that the absorbance peak of both fnps and cnps at 1600 1620 cm 1 corresponded to c c stretching while peaks at 1490 and 1451 cm 1 were attributed to monosubstituted aromatic vibrations gong et al 2022 xu et al 2021 bands at 754 and 711 cm 1 represented aromatic ch vibrations conforming to the presence of polyethylene polymer luo et al 2019 a broad peak at 1700 1725 cm 1 corresponding to c o stretching guan et al 2006 kaiser and guggenberger 2000 yang et al 2016 appeared in cnps spectra but not in fnps ftir results confirmed that carboxyl groups were not initially present on fnps they were successfully introduced to cnps during modification xrd results fig s2c showed the peaks at 18 6 represented the crystalline domains in polymer chains of polyethylene sarkar et al 2021 in addition the results from raman spectra fig s2d suggested that the characteristic peaks at 620 793 1000 1157 1448 and 1600 cm 1 represented the ring stretching ch cc stretching modes as well as the main structures of polyethylene nps sobhani et al 2019 3 2 aggregation kinetics of fresh and carboxyl modified nps 3 2 1 aggregation in nacl and cacl2 solutions aggregation profiles of fnps and cnps were established in nacl and cacl2 electrolyte solutions as shown in fig s3 and s4 the d h of fnps and cnps were significantly improved with increasing nacl and cacl2 concentrations the α values of fnps and cnps representing the probability of collisions resulting in attachment to the total number of collisions improved and approached unity with increasing electrolyte concentration fig 1 for example when the nacl concentration increased from 40 mm to 200 mm the α of fnps correspondingly increased from 0 05 to 0 98 according to the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory colloidal aggregation followed the reaction limited and diffusion limited regions alimi et al 2018 derjaguin and landau 1993 lin et al 1989 wang et al 2013 an α value of less than 1 indicated that repulsive forces in nps colloids dominated the reaction limited regime while the α value approached unity because the energy barrier of the electrostatic double layer edl of nps was eliminated allowing mass transfer to dominate the diffusion limited regime the ccc values were obtained from aggregation profiles representing the minimum electrolyte concentration where colloids were destabilized and α reached unity fig 1 it was observed that the cccca values for both fnps and cnps were significantly lower than the corresponding cccna values suggesting that ca2 exhibited a greater destabilized ability since divalent cations possessed a higher charge density to neutralize negative charges than monovalent cations huangfu et al 2013 liu et al 2019c the aggregation profiles of both fnps and cnps were significantly different in nacl and cacl2 electrolytes in a diffusion limited regime k fast the fast aggregation rates of cnps in nacl and cacl2 solutions were 1 9 and 2 3 nm s 1 respectively and both were significantly higher than those of fnps fig s3 and s4 these results suggested that cnps contained more favorable and reactive sites for cation attachment during aggregate formation moreover the cccna of cnps 780 mm was significantly higher than that of fnps 320 mm fig 1a whereas the cccca of cnps 20 mm was lower than that of fnps 80 mm fig 1b this inverse trend in ccc values of fnps and cnps was attributed to the differences in aggregation mechanisms of na and ca2 especially na improved the aqueous aggregation of nps only by suppressing the edl and decreasing the electrostatic repulsion among colloids therefore compared to fnps the greater negative charge of cnps required a higher na concentration to suppress the edl and induce aggregate formation however except for charge neutralization divalent ca2 was favorable to enhancing cnps aggregation by bridging with carboxyl groups liu et al 2019c qu et al 2010 therefore the observed differences in the aqueous aggregation of cnps and fnps depended on the edl suppression and specific interactions such as bridging effects 3 2 2 aggregation in divalent heavy metal solutions aggregation kinetics of fnps and cnps with heavy metals were significantly different from na or ca2 results showed that heavy metals achieved the aggregation of both fnps and cnps at lower solution concentrations than na or ca2 fig s5 and s6 for example both fnps and cnps formed aggregates of more than 600 nm in solutions containing less than 10 mm of heavy metals as a result the ccc values of all heavy metals for fnps and cnps were significantly lower these results indicated that the widespread occurrence of heavy metals as ubiquitous contaminants in urban water significantly promoted the destabilization of aqueous plastic debris in addition the ccc values of heavy metals for cnps were all lower than those of fnps indicating that cnps was more thermodynamically unstable than fnps in the presence of heavy metals as specific interactions dominated the aggregation mechanism fnps and cnps exhibited different aggregation kinetics in the presence of different heavy metal cations when the cation concentrations were below 2 mm pb ii and cu ii induced obvious cnps aggregation whereas the d h of cnps did not change with cd ii and zn ii figs 2 a and b the ccc values of heavy metals were ranked in the following order figs 2c and d cccpb 7 5 mm ccccu 10 mm ccccd 15 5 mm ccczn 28 mm for fnps and cccpb 2 8 mm ccccu 4 mm ccccd 7 4 mm ccczn 8 9 mm for cnps under similar conditions the electrophoretic mobility of nps decreased kinetically and was different in the presence of various heavy metals fig s7 according to the dlvo theory cations with the same valency should exhibit similar capabilities to neutralize surface negative charges it is observed that the negative ζ of fnps and cnps both increased significantly as increasing heavy metal concentration fig s8 whereas the changes in ζ varied for different divalent heavy metals fig 3 a and b the increase in ζ was ranked in the following order pb ii cu ii cd ii zn ii consistent with the observed trend in ccc values dlvo calculation results fig s9 also showed that the energy barriers of nps were different among the four heavy metals suggesting the abilities of different heavy metals to pass through the edl were significantly distinct previous studies demonstrated that specific interactions such as inner sphere coordination between cations and oxygen containing groups on carbonaceous polymers penetrate the edl and neutralize surface negative charges more effectively than outer sphere interactions pham et al 2009 xia et al 2017 based on the schulze hardy rule the ccchm to cccna ratios should range from z 2 to z 6 considering that spherical colloids were well dispersed without specific interactions elimelech et al 2013 petosa et al 2010 in the present study the ccchm to cccna ratios were all lower than z 6 collectively these results indicated that different edl suppression capacities of divalent heavy metals induced the observed differences in ccc values this variation in charge screening occurred due to specific interactions rather than electrostatic forces when the specific interactions were related to chemical bonding the differences in the ccc value of heavy metals with varying atomic properties were expected 3 2 3 mechanism of aqueous nps aggregation with heavy metals ftir was used to explore the specific interactions between nps and heavy metal cations in the presence of heavy metals the broad absorption peak at 1725 cm 1 c o stretching exhibited a significant shift in cnps spectra fig 3c for example in the presence of pb ii and zn ii cations the peak at 1725 cm 1 shifted to 1767 and 1745 cm 1 respectively in addition in the presence of pb ii the appearance of an adsorption peak at 1235 cm 1 in cnps spectra corresponded to co me bonds vibrations with carboxylates attributed to the formation of bidentate mononuclear ligands guan et al 2006 kaiser and guggenberger 2000 these results indicated that heavy metal cations interacted with nps via inner sphere coordination liu et al 2019c yang et al 2016 the complexation with heavy metals favored high energy sites such as carboxyl groups and further led to the aggregation of nps in that case the cnps with more carboxy groups provided more reactive sites than fnps as a result cnps showed lower ccc values than fnps furthermore the absorption peaks at 1604 cm 1 and 1495 1425 cm 1 representing monosubstituted benzenes vibration within aromatic π delocalized systems gong et al 2022 xu et al 2021 shifted obviously in the presence of heavy metals for instance the absorption peak at 1604 cm 1 shifted to 1598 and 1623 cm 1 in the presence of pb ii and zn ii cations respectively suggesting that heavy metal cations changed the vibration energy of c c stretching and conjugated with π delocalized systems of nps via cation π interactions yang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 such interactions passed through edl and promoted the charge screening by heavy metals to destabilize the nps the differences in the ccc value of heavy metals are also reasonably explained dipole water molecules around the outer shell of heavy metal cations extend the interaction distance with acidic groups or benzene rings thereby lowering the bonding energy xu et al 2005 yang et al 2016 this process is consistent with the hofmeister effect in which cations with a larger atomic radius and thinner hydration shells can more favorably undergo inner sphere coordination xia et al 2017 in the present study the hydration shell thickness of heavy metal cations was ranked in the following order pb 2 83 å cu 3 25 å cd 3 41 å zn 3 49 å nightingale jr 1959 it is known that weakly hydrated heavy metals can more favorably form bridges and aggregate with plastic debris via inner sphere interactions however it was observed that despite cu exhibiting a lower ccc value its hydration shell thickness 3 25 å was larger than that of ca 3 10 å this suggested that in addition to hydrated shell thickness other properties also affect the specific interactions of heavy metals the inner sphere coordination and cation π complexes followed donor acceptor and charge transfer interactions where energy was dependent on the electronegativity of cations over the aromatic plane center ma and dougherty 1997 xu et al 2020 yang et al 2016 it is thus proposed that the electronegativity of heavy metals reflecting the intrinsic electronic density and distribution determined their specific interactions with nps fig 3d showed that the electronegativities of heavy metals were different and negatively correlated with their ccc values indicating that heavy metals with higher electronegativity showed stronger interactions with nps further confirming their higher destabilized ability due to more significant edl suppression or bridging therefore it can be concluded that both the hydration shell thickness and electronegativity of heavy metals determined their specific interactions with nps and subsequently their aqueous aggregation 3 2 4 microcosmic configuration of nps aggregates with heavy metals tem imaging was used to observe changes in the microcosmic configuration of aqueous aggregates in the presence of heavy metals as shown in fig 4 in the presence of pb ii cnps first formed one dimensional 1d tube like structures via particle particle combination along a 1d axis fig 4a this deformation of cnps potentially occurred due to the bridging effect between heavy metals and surface carboxyl groups subsequently these 1d tube like colloids combined along another dimensional axis to form 2d edge to edge piece like aggregates fig 4b which further assembled to form large sandwich like aggregates via face to face interactions figs 4c and d via cation π interactions previous studies demonstrated that aromatic rings in carbonaceous polymers were stacked due to the π cation π structure duan et al 2012 yang et al 2016 in addition the results of raman spectra fig s10 further supported such mechanisms the intensity of peaks at around 1000 cm 1 of cnps significantly increased when the pb was present indicating the larger aggregates of nps formed with heavy metals xu et al 2020a the peak at 3050 cm 1 of nps representing the aromatic rings disappeared due to the strong binding of cation π interactions cole et al 2013 such observations suggested the spatial aggregates of nps grew along with the stacking of 3d face to face structures to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the configuration of aqueous nps aggregates with heavy metals and these novel findings may have a high significance in understanding the fate and mobility of plastic debris in aquatic environments 3 3 deposition kinetics of nps 3 3 1 deposition kinetics in divalent heavy metal solutions the deposition kinetics of fnps and cnps on a silica surface was tested by qcm d in the absence of heavy metals fnps and cnps were not deposited on the silica surface due to their negatively charged surface representative frequency shift δf curves for fnps and cnps were observed over time in the presence of 0 5 mm heavy metals as shown in figs s11 and s12 such deposition on the silica surface was partly attributed to the decreasing energy barrier against silica due to edl suppression by heavy metals in addition the divalent heavy metals bridged nps colloids and the silica surface via inner sphere coordination promoting their deposition these deposition processes included both fast and slow rate regions fig 5 a and b suggesting that nps deposited to form an initial layer while steric effects later inhibited the process after the accumulation of more aggregates eita 2011 xu et al 2020b deposition rates r d were determined to reveal the deposition attachment efficiency and mass transfer to the surface hwang et al 2013 yi and chen 2013 the r d of fnps and cnps in the presence of 0 5 mm heavy metals were ranked in the following order pb ii cu ii cd ii zn ii demonstrating a consistent trend to the ranked order of electronegativity this confirmed that the higher electronegativity of heavy metals led to the formation of stronger complexes between nps and the silica surface and a higher deposition rate the only exception was cu which exhibited a higher electronegativity than zn but showed a lower cnps deposition rate fig 5b this phenomenon can be explained as cu ii causing a faster cnps aggregation than zn ii resulting in the formation of larger nps aggregates with a lower diffusion coefficient and deposition rate following the stokes einstein equation overall these results suggest that the deposition of nps was determined by the electronegativity of heavy metals the r d of cnps was significantly higher than that of fnps as shown in fig 5 the carboxyl groups on cnps acted as reactive sites for complexation with heavy metals and deposition on the silica surface with increasing heavy metal concentrations the changes in r d were non monotonic following a bell shaped distribution figs 6 a and b for example the r d of fnps increased from 13 3 10 3 hz s 1 to 122 8 hz s 1 with increasing pb ii concentrations from 0 1 mm to 1 mm then decreased to 9 7 hz s 1 with a further increase in pb ii concentration to 10 mm similar trends were reported for the deposition of other nanoparticles huangfu et al 2018 hwang et al 2013 quevedo et al 2013 xu et al 2020b initial increases in heavy metal concentration enhanced edl suppression and bridging effects while further increases in heavy metal concentration yet hindered the combination of nps with silica due to the restriction of hydrated shells such mechanisms were supported by the results of atomic force microscope afm fig s13 adhesion forces between fnps and silica surface representing the interaction strength contributing to the deposition first increased but then decreased as increasing pb concentration from 0 to 10 mm this trend of changes in adhesion force was consistent with those in r d moreover the larger aggregation of fnps and cnps under higher heavy metal concentration fig 2 resulted in a decrease in mass transfer when this reduction in mass transfer outweighed the increased attachment of nps on the silica surface the r d value decreased accordingly similar to ccc the critical deposition concentration cdc refers to the minimum concentration at which the maximum r d is reached describing the effect of heavy metals on the deposition of nps the heavy metals cdc values for both fnps and cnps were ranked in the following order cdcpb cdccu cdccd cdczn negatively correlating with the electronegativity in addition the cdc values of heavy metals for cnps were lower than those for fnps as shown in figs 6a and b under low heavy metal concentration conditions i e below the cdc the attachment of nps onto silica was the dominant mechanism however under high heavy metal concentration conditions i e above the cdc the mass transfer of nps dominated and aggregation hindered the deposition of nps this mechanism also explained the observed phenomenon that when cation concentration was higher than the cdc the heavy metals with the stronger aggregation capability showed less deposition of both fnps and cnps figs 6a and b 3 3 2 release of nps from the silica surface with increasing heavy metal concentrations the release percentage of fnps and cnps initially decreased and then increased significantly figs 6c and d for example with an increase in pb ii concentration from 0 1 mm to 1 mm the release percentage of fnps and cnps initially decreased to zero from 32 1 and 33 5 respectively then increased to 100 these results suggested that the nps undergo irreversible deposition under low heavy metal concentration whereas detachment from the silica surface was more favorable under higher heavy metal concentrations this phenomenon was observed because the deposition onto the silica surface at low heavy metal concentrations largely depended on specific interactions with heavy metals more thermodynamically stable than non specific interactions coward et al 2018 wagai and mayer 2007 zhu et al 2020b however under high cation concentration nps were significantly aggregated and favored deposition via non specific interactions this is supported by previous studies revealing that the colloidal aggregation reduces the availability of reactive sites with aggregates interacting with mineral surfaces through van der waals forces huangfu et al 2018 liao et al 2017 it was also observed that heavy metals with higher electronegativity exhibited lower critical concentrations to reach the minimum release percentage this trend was consistent with that of the ccc and cdc for heavy metals suggesting that heavy metals with higher electronegativity were better able to combine irreversibly with nps and silica under low concentrations however higher concentrations of heavy metals with higher electronegativity resulted in more significant aggregation of nps thereby increasing the release of nps from the silica surface in addition the release percentages of cnps were lower than those of fnps suggesting that although cnps aggregated more significantly than fnps the high content of carboxyl groups on cnps still formed a strong complex with silica 3 3 3 viscoelastic properties of the deposition layer the viscoelastic properties of fnps and cnps deposition layers in the presence of heavy metals were also investigated the ratio of dissipation energy to frequency shift δd δf was calculated fig s14 the relatively high δd δf indicated a swollen and soft deposition layer while a relatively low δd δf suggested a rigid and compact layer huangfu et al 2018 jin et al 2021 xu et al 2020b with increasing heavy metal cation concentrations the δd δf values of both fnps and cnps initially decreased to a minimum level then increased significantly thereafter figs 7 a and b the slopes of δd versus δf were constant for fnps and cnps at low cation concentrations while an increasing trend was observed over time under high concentrations fig s14 these results are well explained by the mechanisms discussed above the initial deposition of nps on the silica surface relied on bridging with heavy metals via specific interactions these interactions were the atomic range force that penetrated the hydrated shell resulting in the formation of a compact layer on the silica surface however once an initial layer of nps was deposited across the reactive sites on the silica surface aggregates with extended structures gradually were developed and formed a soft deposition layer chowdhury et al 2015 furman et al 2013 hwang et al 2013 therefore under low heavy metal concentrations nps deposited as a primary compact layer through specific interactions when obvious np aggregation occurred these large aggregates were partially deposited onto the primary layer forming patches and loosening and swelling the deposition layer fig 7c similar to the trend observed for ccc and cdc heavy metals with higher electronegativity reached their minimum δd δf values at lower critical concentrations this phenomenon occurred because heavy metals with higher electronegativity preferentially formed bridges with nps via specific interactions leading to the formation of compact deposition layers moreover no significant differences in the δd δf values of fnps and cnps were observed suggesting that carboxyl groups on nps surfaces did not affect the viscoelastic properties of the deposition layer 3 4 colloidal behaviors of nps in urban waters different water matrix including heavy metal nom and also other ions were employed to explore the aggregation and deposition behavior of nps especially the heavy metal concentrations in waters were environmentally relevant natural organic matters nom commonly existed in urban waters and will affect the colloidal behaviors of nps significantly the aggregation and deposition rates of nps in water 1 and 2 including around 2 mg c l 1 nom and 0 4 mm pb were obviously decreased compared to those without nom fig 8 in particular the disaggregation of fnps in water 1 and 2 containing nom over time was observed though the initial its d h was high due to presence of heavy metals and extra ca2 the results suggested the nom as negatively charged macromolecules relieved the destabilization of nps due to association with heavy metals such phenomenon resulted from the facts that nom might improve the colloidal stability of nps via charge accumulation and steric hindrance huangfu et al 2013 xu et al 2021 it should also be noted that compared to that without heavy metals the waters with heavy metals still raised the destabilization of nps even though nom was present the results suggested that the presence of heavy metals with environmentally relevant concentrations will significantly affect the mobility of nps in real urban water systems it is also observed that the coexisting backgrounding ions not significantly changed the impacts of heavy metals cations for example the stability of nps in water 3 containing 0 3 mm zn and around 100 mm na and 45 mm ca2 approached to that in solution only containing zn fig 8 in addition the trends of destabilization in waters corresponded to above conclusions for instance the presence of pb in water 2 led to the aggregation of nps and resulted in the higher deposition rates and irreversibility than that of zn due its higher electronegativity furthermore the impacts of nom in waters on destabilization of cnps were more significant than fnps this result implied that the stability of nps associated heavy metals will be higher in urban waters over time 3 5 environmental implications in urban waters this study provides important insights into the aggregation and deposition of nps with heavy metals in urban waters our findings suggested that fresh ps nps could more effectively carry heavy metals in wwtp effluent while carboxyl modified ps nps associated with heavy metals settle enter the sewage sludges and are discharged as biosolids more easily the fate of nps associated with heavy metals in the aqueous solid interface depends on the tradeoff of attachment i e bridging by cations and mass transfer i e aggregation in addition experiments on urban water identified the enhanced effects of heavy metals on the destabilization and deposition of nps despite of coexistence of nom and backgrounding ions such information can be further used to assess and understand the mobility and fate of nps associated with contaminants in wwtp systems or natural environments it is also highlighted that sorption capacity alone may not be an effective standard to assess the change in mobility of pollutants carried by nps in addition the electronegativity or polarity properties of pollutants in urban water should be considered when evaluating the fate of nps associated with heavy metals or polar chemicals capable of specific interactions with nps as a potential water treatment approach the same principle can be used to design inorganic coagulants and collector grains for the removal of nps however this study is limited to the observations of destabilization of nps in urban waters and the deposition of nps on the silica surface further studies should be extended to the colloidal behaviors of nps in real urban water systems including more complex components and substrates for instance the microbes or other particles in urban waters should be considered to evaluate the stability of nps while the deposition of nps on the municipal sludge or fe mn oxides as substrates should also be further tested the selection of ps nps in the study was to explore the corresponding mechanisms whereas the real distribution and characters of nps in real urban waters should be further explored and more plastic types should also be evaluated to comprehensively explore the mobility and fate of nps associated with heavy metals 4 conclusions in this study 1 we probed the impacts of heavy metals varying with property on the aggregation of nano scale plastics in aqueous solutions and the involved interaction mechanisms while observed the microscopic configurations of np aggregates in the presence of heavy metals 2 we explored the deposition kinetics of nps in heavy metal containing urban water in addition the deposition irreversibility and deposition layer characteristics were studied since these processes are important in evaluating the fate of nps and are barely reported the main conclusions include 1 carboxyl groups enhanced the colloidal stability of ps nps in a monovalent electrolyte solution and improved the aggregation of ps nps in the presence of ca2 or heavy metals 2 the ccc values of heavy metals were an order of magnitude lower than those of environmental cations the electronegativity and ionic radii or hydration shell thickness of different heavy metals at the same valency state were used to determine differences in the aggregation kinetics of ps nps via specific interactions i e inner sphere coordination and cation π interactions 3 differences in the deposition of nps on the grain collector occurred due to variations in surface attachment and mass transfer relating to the electronegativity of heavy metals and the aggregation state of nps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

15688,this study investigated the effect of polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics on the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci in ultrapure water at ph 6 0 0 1 in the absence of microplastics the uv inactivation of the studied bacteria exhibited an initial resistance followed by a faster inactivation of free dispersed bacteria while in the presence of microplastics these 2 regimes were followed by an additional regime of slower or no inactivation related to microplastic associated bacteria i e bacteria aggregated with microplastics resulting in shielding bacteria from uv indicated by tailing at higher uv fluences the magnitude of the negative effect of microplastics varied with different microplastics type particle size and bacteria gram negative and gram positive results showed that when the uv transmittance of the microplastic containing water was not taken into account in calculating uv fluences the effect of microplastics as protectors of bacteria was overestimated a uv fluence based double exponential microbial inactivation model accounting for both free and microplastic associated bacteria could describe well the disinfection data the present study elucidated the effect of microplastics on the performance of uv disinfection and the approach used herein to prove this concept may guide future research on the investigation of the possible effect of other particles including nanoplastics with different characteristics on the exposure response curve for the inactivation of various microorganisms by physical and chemical disinfection processes in different water and wastewater matrices graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics disinfection wastewater treatment antimicrobial resistance 1 introduction millions of tons of plastics are produced annually to meet the needs of modern society from which the majority ends up in landfills or the natural environment as plastic waste geyer et al 2017 this has resulted in the presence of plastics of different sizes in various environmental compartments worldwide ateia et al 2022 koelmans et al 2019 for example plastic debris at the micro size 1 5000 µm lim 2021 called microplastics have been detected globally in air gasperi et al 2018 soil boots et al 2019 scheurer and bigalke 2018 zhang and liu 2018 wastewater blair et al 2019 park et al 2020 seawater collignon et al 2012 drinking water and surface waters such as lakes and rivers koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2018 yonkos et al 2014 and are considered as emerging contaminants amato lourenço et al 2020 blair et al 2019 browne et al 2007 the presence of microplastics in various environmental matrices has initiated concerns related to their possible adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem campanale et al 2020 de souza machado et al 2018 green et al 2017 prata 2018 the last decade wastewater treatment plants wwtps received great attention as significant sources for microplastics in the aquatic environment cheng et al 2021 liu et al 2021 murphy et al 2016 park et al 2020 ziajahromi et al 2017 for this reason there was an increasing interest in investigating the presence of microplastics in wwtps for example microplastics of polyethelene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc have been detected in influents and effluents of wwtps worldwide 0 0 5 6 mg l cheng et al 2021 edo et al 2020 grbić et al 2020 park et al 2020 yang et al 2019 this indicates clearly that wwtps are a pathway for microplastics connecting the anthropogenic activity and the aquatic environment wei et al 2021 ziajahromi et al 2017 the detection of microplastics in both influents and effluents of wwtps suggests the presence of microplastics in all wastewater treatment stages and processes taking place in wwtps similar observations were reported for drinking water treatment plants and processes sarkar et al 2021 shen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the current study dealt with the effect of microplastics on water treatment performance recently the effect of microplastics on biological wastewater treatment processes was studied liu et al 2019 wei et al 2021 2019 zhang et al 2020 it was reported that in a short time of 2 h microplastics such as polyester pe and pvc do not affect significantly the activities of ammonium oxidizing bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria denitrifiers and polyphosphate accumulating organisms and hence it was concluded that microplastics do not affect the performance of biological wastewater treatment in terms of nitrogen and phosphorous removal efficiencies liu et al 2019 on the other hand in a longer time of 264 d pvc microplastics were reported to negatively affect the anaerobic granural sludge treatment process in terms of chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency and methane production zhang et al 2020 furthermore pe microplastics were shown to inhibit the aerobic and anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge due to the reduction of key bacteria through oxidative stress and or the release of toxic chemicals and due to the induction of reactive oxygen species respectively wei et al 2021 2019 other water treatment processes such as membrane filtration are also negatively affected by microplastics because of fouling mechanisms enfrin et al 2020 2019 li et al 2021 the present study focused on the effect of microplastics on the process of disinfection it is known that particles may affect the efficiency of uv disinfection by absorbing scattering and or blocking uv light resulting in lower amount of light available for disinfection reduced available uv energy and or shielding microorganisms respectively christensen and linden 2003 qualls et al 1983 for example it was reported that suspended particles in wastewater can negatively affect the uv inactivation of microorganisms by increasing the uv absorbance of the water and by shielding microorganisms from uv light christensen and linden 2003 emerick et al 1999 to this end the current study investigated if microplastics in water cause similar phenomena limited work has been done so far on the effect of microplastics on water disinfection efficiency enfrin et al 2019 to the best of the authors knowledge the only reported study on this topic evaluated the effect of 2 types of microplastics i e granular polyethylene microplastic and fibrous polyamide microplastic on the time based inactivation of e coli by ultraviolet uv irradiation and chlorine in water shen et al 2021 in this study the results were interpreted based on the exposure of bacteria to the disinfecting agent i e for uv disinfection the uv fluence mj cm2 which is the product of the average uv intensity mw cm2 and exposure time s and can be corrected with the uv transmittance uvt of the water matrix this is of utmost importance in differentiating between possible interaction of microplastics with uv at 254 nm which can be taken into account by correcting the uv fluence by the uvt of the water and interaction of microplastics with bacteria e g protection of bacteria by microplastics moreover the effect of other microplastics with different behavior in water e g pvc or pe of different particle size on the uv inactivation of other fecal indicator bacteria e g gram positive bacteria such as enterococci has not been investigated yet although microplastics were reported as hotspots of antibiotic resistance genes liu et al 2021 their effect on the uv inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria has not been studied so far these are important to better understand the impact of different microplastics on the performance of uv disinfection and their possible contribution to the spread of antibiotic resistance in water through lower inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria the present study investigated the effect of 3 microplastics on the uv inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci in ultrapure water at ph 6 0 0 1 and room temperature 25 1 c the objectives of the study were to i evaluate the effect of the concentration of microplastics on the uv inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci ii investigate the effect of polyethylene 125 µm deposited at the surface of water polyethylene 40 48 µm well mixed in water and polyvinyl chloride 250 µm deposited at the bottom of the petri dish microplastics on the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci iii explore and differentiate the effect of microplastics uv and microplastics bacteria interactions on uv disinfection performance iv develop a uv fluence based double exponential microbial inactivation model to predict the inactivation of free bacteria and microplastic associated bacteria and v calculate uv fluence requirements for 1 5 log reductions of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci in both the absence and presence of microplastics this paper is a proof of concept study that may guide future research on the investigation of the possible effect of different particles including nanoplastics with different characteristics on the exposure response curve for the inactivation of other microbial targets by physical and or chemical disinfection processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents polyethylene microplastics ultra high molecular weight surface modified powder average particle size 125 µm pe1 and particle size 40 48 µm pe2 were purchased from sigma aldrich mo usa polyvinyl chloride microplastics unplasticised powder particle size 250 µm pvc were purchased from goodfellow cambridge limited england uk the selection of polyethylene pe1 and pe2 and polyvinyl chlorine pvc plastics was based on their frequent detection in the environment alimi et al 2018 rochman et al 2013 the particle size of pe1 and pvc microplastics i e 125 µm and 250 µm respectively is within the particle size range of the microplastics with the highest abundance in wastewater i e 100 500 µm zhang et al 2020 the lower particle size of pe2 microplastics i e 40 48 µm allowed for better mixing and hence the incorporation of the uvt of the pe2 microplastic containing water in the calculation of uv fluence information about the microplastics used in the study is presented in table 1 details on other chemicals and reagents used in this study are given in text s1 2 2 multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci the e coli and enterococci bacteria were isolated from raw wastewater collected at the inlet of a wwtp in cyprus through the inoculation of 0 1 ml of wastewater on chromocult coliform agar cca and slanetz and bartley agar sba respectively which were spiked with the three antibiotics of interest i e trimethoprim ciprofloxacin and ampicillin followed by incubation at 44 c for 24 h for e coli and 37 c for 48 h for enterococci bacterial stocks of the cultivated multidrug resistant bacteria to the aforementioned antibiotics were recultivated on tryptic soy agar tsa prior to uv disinfection experiments 4 recultivated colonies were selected and inoculated into sterile tubes containing 10 ml of tryptic soy broth tsb and then incubated overnight at 37 c the formed pellet was collected by centrifugation at 3500 rcf for 15 min and then resuspended in a phosphate buffered saline pbs solution the initial concentration of antibiotic resistant bacteria spiked in water for disinfection experiments was in line with their concentration in wastewaters i e 104 105 cfu 100 ml balachandran et al 2021 pepper et al 2018 details regarding the selection of the concentrations of the antibiotics are given in text s2 2 3 uv disinfection experiments in the presence of microplastics a bench scale collimated beam apparatus trojan technologies trojanuv london ontario canada coupled with a low pressure uv lamp emitting at 254 nm was used to study the uv fluence based inactivation kinetics for multidrug resistant bacteria in the absence and in the presence of microplastics the petri factor which is the ratio of the average uv intensity over the area of the petri dish to the central uv intensity was determined as 0 91 indicating a well designed collimated beam apparatus bolton and linden 2003 experiments were conducted in milli q water at ph 6 0 0 1 and room temperature 25 1 c to prove the concept of the effect of microplastics on the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of bacteria ultrapure water milli q without buffer ph 6 0 was used to rule out a possible effect of wastewater constituents and or buffer ions on microplastics and or on the inactivation of bacteria and hence to ensure that the observed effect is only related to the interaction of microplastics with bacteria and or microplastics with uv light microplastics pe1 pe2 or pvc were individually added in a glass petri dish of external diameter of 6 0 cm and height of 3 5 cm followed by the addition of 59 95 ml water and the spiking of 0 05 ml of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci solution the concentration of microplastics was 0 25 1 0 g l which is in agreement with the concentrations of microplastics used in reported studies on the interaction between microplastics and chemical pollutants in water atugoda et al 2021 chen et al 2021 elizalde velázquez et al 2020 liu et al 2020 in addition to being in line with the aforementioned studies these concentrations of microplastics were used to have a measurable difference in uvt between water and microplastic containing water which is essential to prove the concept of the effect of microplastics on uv disinfection the solution containing bacteria and microplastics was stirred using magnetic stirrer for 2 h to allow a possible interaction between microplastics and bacteria then a 10 ml sample was taken to measure the uvt of the solution at 254 nm and the initial concentration of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci i e before their exposure to uv prior to exposing the water to uv the central uv intensity at the same height with the surface of the water was measured using a radiometer the distance from the surface of the water to the uv lamp was 45 cm to initiate a disinfection experiment the 50 ml solution was exposed to uv by placing the petri dish on a magnetic stirrer beneath the collimated beam experiments were performed at several uv fluences i e 0 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 8 5 10 0 12 5 15 0 and 18 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant e coli and 0 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 0 12 5 15 0 18 0 and 20 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant enterococci the required exposure time s to achieve the targeted uv fluence mj cm2 was calculated by the uvt of the water with or without microplastics the internal diameter of the petri dish 5 6 cm the volume of the solution 50 ml and the central uv intensity mw cm2 bolton and linden 2003 chowdhury et al 2020 venditto et al 2022 experiments were conducted in triplicate and the averages with standard deviations are presented the 95 prediction interval of the uv fluence based microbial inactivation kinetic model used in this study was calculated using sigmaplot software 2 4 analytical methods the cultivable multidrug resistant bacteria were enumerated by the membrane filtration method novo and manaia 2010 details on bacteria enumeration are given in text s3 the uvt of water at 254 nm was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer jasco v 530 and the uv intensity at 254 nm was recorded by a uvc light meter lutron electronic uvc 254a an ezdo pl 600 ph meter was used to measure the ph 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the concentration of microplastics on uv disinfection performance initially the effect of concentration of microplastics on the uv inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci was assessed experiments were performed at different concentrations of pe1 microplastics i e 0 25 g l 0 5 g l and 1 0 g l at a uv fluence of 10 0 mj cm2 and 15 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively the results in the presence of microplastics were compared with the results in the absence of microplastics control or 0 0 g l fig 1 shows no effect of pe1 microplastics on the uv inactivation of the studied bacteria at concentrations of 0 25 g l and 0 5 g l as the same reduction of bacteria in the presence and in the absence of microplastics was observed this was consistent for both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci figs 1a and b at the highest pe1 concentration used 1 0 g l the log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli decreased from 5 5 to 2 5 at 1 0 g l pe1 microplastics a lower disinfection performance was also observed for multidrug resistant enterococci i e the log reduction decreased from 5 5 without microplastics to 3 5 with microplastics these observations indicate a negative effect of microplastics on the uv disinfection performance which resulted in a 3 log and 2 log lower reduction of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively due to the presence of 1 0 g l pe1 microplastics compared with their absence it is worth noting that preliminary experiments showed no difference in the concentration of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci before without microplastics and after the 2 h mixing with microplastics figs s1a and b indicating no reduction of bacteria due to microplastics alone i e before their exposure to uv this shows clearly that microplastics at 1 0 g l affected negatively the performance of uv disinfection figs 1 and s1 this observation is in line with the known negative effect of suspended solids on the efficiency of uv disinfection of secondary effluent wastewater azimi et al 2012 it is also well documented in the literature that particles in water cause tailing phenomena at high uv fluences azimi et al 2012 to examine if microplastics cause a similar tailing effect experiments at different uv fluences were required 3 2 effect of uv fluence on uv disinfection performance in the presence of pe1 microplastics to evaluate the effect of uv fluence on the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci experiments were performed at different uv fluences i e 0 0 18 0 mj cm2 and 0 0 20 0 mj cm2 respectively in the absence and in the presence of pe1 microplastics for the tests in the presence of microplastics the concentration of pe1 microplastics was kept constant at 1 0 g l fig 1 the developed uv fluence response curves for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci in the absence and in the presence of pe1 microplastics are presented in figs 2 a and 3 a respectively lower inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli was observed in the presence than the absence of pe1 microplastics for example at a uv fluence of 8 5 mj cm2 the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli decreased from 3 5 log without microplastics to 2 0 log with microplastics fig 2a at the highest uv fluence applied in the absence of pe1 microplastics 10 0 mj cm2 the difference in inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli was the highest i e 2 5 log and 5 5 log reduction in the presence and in the absence of pe1 microplastics respectively a lower inactivation was also seen in the case of multidrug resistant enterococci the log reduction of multidrug resistant enterococci decreased from 3 5 to 2 0 at a uv fluence of 12 5 mj cm2 and from 5 5 to 3 5 at uv fluence of 15 0 mj cm2 in the absence and in the presence of pe1 microplastics respectively results of experiments at higher uv fluences in the presence of pe1 microplastics showed tailing effect i e a slower kinetic regime which has not been observed in the absence of microplastics figs 2a and 3a this tailing was observed for both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci the aforementioned negative effect of pe1 microplastics on the efficiency of the process of uv disinfection may be due to the interaction of microplastics with uv light i e consumption of the uv irradiation by microplastics and or the interaction of microplastics with bacteria i e bacteria aggregated with microplastics resulting in shielding bacteria from uv it should be noted that the uvt of water in the absence and in the presence of pe1 microplastics was similar i e 99 7 and 98 5 respectively table 1 the reason for this similarity in uvt is that pe1 microplastics have lower density than water i e 0 94 g ml versus 1 00 g ml causing pe1 microplastics to be deposited at the surface of the water in the cuvette and hence a similar measurement of uvt by the spectrophotometer was recorded this means that the interaction of pe1 microplastics and uv light was not captured during the uvt measurement and therefore it was not taken into account when calculating the uv fluence considering this we could not differentiate if the observed negative effect of pe1 microplastics on the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci was due to the interaction of pe1 microplastics with uv and or with bacteria it is known that the accurate measurement of uv fluence is important for the interpretation of results obtained by uv experiments almuhtaram et al 2021 the presence of particles in water generally increases the uv absorbance of water and hence decreases the uvt which is one of the factors affecting the uv fluence measurement christensen and linden 2003 however the effect of microplastics on the inactivation of bacteria in the domain of uv fluence corrected by the uvt of the microplastic containing water has not been investigated yet shen et al 2021 this is essential to elucidate the role of microplastics in decreasing the uv inactivation of bacteria in water and requires the use of a microplastic that allows for the incorporation of uvt in calculating the uv fluence 3 3 effect of pe2 microplastics on uv disinfection performance to get insights into the reason for the observed negative effect of microplastics on the uv disinfection performance an identical set of experiments was performed using a microplastic of lower particle size i e pe2 table 1 although the 2 polyethylene microplastics used in the study pe1 and pe2 have the same density the lower particle size of pe2 microplastics allowed for a good dispersion of the microplastics in water under mixing and the interaction of pe2 microplastics and uv light at 254 nm could be captured by the uvt measurement and used for the calculation of uv fluence i e uvt of 86 4 in the presence of pe2 microplastics and 99 7 in the absence of pe2 microplastics table 1 figs 2b and 3b show the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively in the presence of pe2 microplastics compared with the absence of pe2 microplastics a similar uv fluence based inactivation of the studied bacteria without and with pe2 microplastics was observed at a uv fluence range of 2 5 8 5 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant e coli and 2 5 12 5 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant enterococci interestingly the log reduction decreased at the highest uv fluence i e from 5 5 to 4 5 multidrug resistant e coli and from 5 5 log to 4 0 log multidrug resistant enterococci in the absence and in the presence of pe2 microplastics respectively a tailing was observed for both bacteria at higher uv fluences figs 2b and 3b considering that in the case of pe2 microplastics the interaction of microplastics and uv was taken into account by uvt table 1 the findings suggest that the 1 log lower inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and the 1 5 log lower inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci are due to a possible protection of bacteria by microplastics the aforementioned observation of the negative effect of pe2 microplastics indicates that only a small fraction of the multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci was associated with microplastics i e 1 log for e coli and 1 5 log for enterococci this is in agreement with the similar inactivation with and without pe2 microplastics at uv fluence 10 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant e coli and uv fluence 15 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant enterococci and the tailing effect at higher uv fluences i e free bacteria were inactivated first followed by a slower or no inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria this is in line with reported studies on the inactivation of fecal indicator bacteria e g e coli fecal coliforms and enterococci by several chemical disinfecting agents such as peracetic acid performic acid and ferrate vi where the small fraction of bacteria 1 2 log that was associated with particles such as total suspended solids in wastewaters i e particle associated bacteria exhibited slower exposure based inactivation than free dispersed bacteria indicated by tailing at higher exposure values campo et al 2020 maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2020 2019 this was also reported for the uv disinfection of wastewater containing suspended solids e g bioflocs azimi et al 2012 the results suggest a similar phenomenon in the case of microplastics i e the multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci aggregated with microplastics i e microplastic associated multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci resulting in shielding these bacteria from the uv irradiation leading to a slower inactivation than free bacteria it is worth noting that the differentiation between the two possible reasons for the negative effect of microplastics on uv disinfection can only be made in the domain of uv fluence corrected by the uvt of the water with or without microplastics this is important because the water containing pe2 microplastics has a lower uvt than the water without pe2 microplastics table 1 and therefore a longer exposure time is needed to deliver the same uv fluence in the presence than in the absence of pe2 microplastics to further elucidate this we performed experiments in the presence of pe2 microplastics where the uv fluence was calculated using the uvt of the water without pe2 microplastics uvtcontrol instead of the uvt in the presence of pe2 microplastics uvtpe2 and we compared the results with the ones obtained by the experiment without microplastics control based on the hypothesis of 2 different reasons for the negative effect of microplastics on uv disinfection i e microplastics uv and microplastics bacteria interactions this experiment should have given different results i e higher inactivation of bacteria at uvtpe2 than uvtcontrol since the first indicates the effect of pe2 bacteria interaction only and the later includes both the effects of pe2 uv and pe2 bacteria interactions results are shown in fig 4 when the uvtcontrol was used to calculate the uv fluence the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli decreased from 5 5 log to 3 5 log in the absence of pe2 microplastics control and in the presence of pe2 microplastics uvtcontrol respectively this 2 log difference in the reduction of bacteria is two times higher than the difference in inactivation when the uvtpe2 was used to calculate the uv fluence 1 log lower reduction from 5 5 log to 4 5 log fig 4a this suggests that the pe2 bacteria interaction i e protection of bacteria by pe2 microplastics and the pe2 uv interaction consumption of uv by pe2 microplastics are responsible for 1 log lower inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli each fig 4a this observation is consistent with the results obtained for multidrug resistant enterococci at uvtcontrol with pe2 microplastics a 2 log lower reduction than the absence of pe2 microplastics was observed while the inactivation decreased by 1 5 log at uvtpe2 fig 4b to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first time that the effect of microplastics on disinfection was clarified in this manner showing that microplastics may interact with bacteria in water and that these microplastic associated bacteria have slower inactivation kinetics compared with the free bacteria it was also clearly shown herein that no incorporation of the uvt in calculating the uv fluence may result in overestimation of the effect of microplastics as protectors of bacteria figs 4a and b 3 4 effect of pvc microplastics on uv disinfection performance to expand the study to another commonly found type of microplastic in water similar experiments were performed using pvc figs 2c and 3c show the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively in the presence of pvc microplastics compared with their absence in the case of multidrug resistant e coli for up to a uv fluence of 8 5 mj cm2 no effect of pvc microplastics was observed interestingly at a higher uv fluence of 10 0 mj cm2 the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli decreased from 5 5 log to 3 5 log due to the presence of pvc microplastics fig 2c a similar trend was observed for the inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci i e no effect of pvc microplastics for up to 12 5 mj cm2 while at a uv fluence of 15 0 mj cm2 the inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci decreased from 5 5 log to 4 5 log without and with pvc microplastics respectively fig 3c at higher uv fluences a tailing was observed for both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci it should be noted that pvc microplastics had different behavior than pe microplastics in water i e pvc microplastics have higher density than water i e 1 38 g ml versus 1 00 g ml resulting in their deposition at the bottom of the petri dish that being said the observed effect of pvc microplastics on uv disinfection is due to a possible interaction of bacteria with pvc microplastics or protection of bacteria by pvc microplastics despite the fact that the measured uvt in the presence of pvc microplastics is similar to their absence i e 99 5 and 99 7 respectively table 1 since the uv irradiation occurs from the top to the bottom using a collimated beam the uv light may interact with the pvc microplastics only after it is transmitted through the water sample significantly the pvc results figs 2c and 3c are consistent with the results obtained using pe2 microplastics figs 2b and 3b where a negative effect of microplastics on the uv disinfection was only observed at a uv fluence of 10 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant e coli and 15 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant enterococci the results of both pe2 and pvc microplastics suggest that a fraction of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci was associated with microplastics leading to their slower inactivation than free bacteria which was indicated by a tailing effect this is consistent with the fact that no difference in the inactivation of the studied bacteria with and without pvc or pe2 microplastics was observed at uv fluence 8 5 mj cm2 for e coli and uv fluence 12 5 mj cm2 for enterococci i e rapid inactivation of free bacteria followed by a slower or no inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria figs 2 and 3 the results are in line with the slower uv inactivation of particle associated microorganisms than free microorganisms due to the presence for example of total suspended solids 1 2 µm in wastewater azimi et al 2012 christensen and linden 2003 emerick et al 2000 hu et al 2007 interestingly the magnitude of the effect of solids on the uv inactivation of bacteria varied with the size of the particles azimi et al 2012 taking this into account and considering that in the uv fluence domain the effect of microplastics on uv disinfection depends predominantly on the interaction of microplastics with bacteria i e microplastic associated bacteria the different effect of microplastics observed herein figs 2b c 3b and c may be due to either their different type i e polyethylene versus polyvinyl chloride or their different particle size i e 40 48 µm versus 250 µm or both 3 5 inactivation kinetic modeling in the absence and presence of microplastics in the absence of microplastics the uv inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci which were free dispersed bacteria in water exhibited an initial resistance followed by a faster inactivation figs 2 and 3 to describe both inactivation regimes a uv fluence based inactivation model that includes a parameter m describing initial resistance of bacteria to uv shoulder effects m 1 was used eq 1 balachandran et al 2021 haas and joffe 1994 1 n n 0 e k f uv fluence m where n0 and n are the concentrations of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci cfu 100 ml initially and after exposure to uv respectively uv fluence also known as uv dose is the exposure of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci to uv mj cm2 and kf is a uv fluence based inactivation rate constant for free multidrug resistant bacteria cm2 mj m in the presence of microplastics the aforementioned inactivation regimes were followed by a tailing phase i e a slower or no inactivation of the microplastic associated bacteria the biphasic behavior due to the different uv inactivation kinetics of free and microplastic associated bacteria was described with a uv fluence based double exponential microbial inactivation model eq 2 manoli et al 2019 santoro et al 2015 2 n n 0 1 β e k f uv fluence m β e k mp uv fluence where β is the fraction of the microplastic associated bacteria and kmp is a uv fluence based inactivation rate constant for microplastic associated multidrug resistant bacteria cm2 mj the inactivation model parameters kf and m in the absence of microplastics eq 1 and β kf m and kmp in the presence of microplastics eq 2 were fitted simultaneously by excel solver with the aim to minimize the difference between experimental and model predicted inactivation data the determined parameters are presented in table 2 interestingly a similar initial resistance was observed in the absence and in the presence of different microplastics for example at a uv fluence of 5 0 mj cm2 a log reduction of 1 was seen without and with microplastics for multidrug resistant e coli this was consistent for all microplastics used in the study i e pe1 pe2 and pvc microplastics significantly the initial resistance of multidrug resistant e coli to uv that was observed herein for up to 5 0 mj cm2 was in reasonable agreement with the initial resistance of e coli to uv of up to 4 0 mj cm2 without microplastics reported earlier sun et al 2016 in the case of multidrug resistant enterococci the initial resistance which was similar for all microplastics and without microplastics was up to 7 5 mj cm2 the findings suggest that the studied microplastics did not affect the initial resistance of bacteria to uv to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first study to draw the abovementioned conclusion this observation is in agreement with the inactivation model parameter m which was determined as higher than 1 in both the absence and the presence of microplastics indicating shoulder effects table 2 the phenomenon of initial resistance of bacteria to uv observed herein m 1 is in line with the initial resistance of bacteria to disinfecting agents in the absence of microplastics e g e coli fecal coliforms and enterococci to peracetic acid campo et al 2020 maffettone et al 2020 e coli fecal coliforms enterococci pseudomonas aeruginosa and total heterotrophs to ozone iakovides et al 2021 enterococci to performic acid maffettone et al 2020 and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci to peracetic acid balachandran et al 2021 campo et al 2020 phenomena of initial resistance were also reported for uv disinfection without microplastics e g e coli and bacillus subtilis spores hijnen et al 2006 sun et al 2016 this is not always the case though for example no shoulder effects were observed for the inactivation of fecal coliforms by ferrate vi manoli et al 2020 and murine norovirus did not exhibit initial resistance to uv peracetic acid ferrate vi and performic acid maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2020 the inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria by uv in water varied with different microplastics and bacteria figs 2 and 3 for example the pvc microplastic associated multidrug resistant e coli had faster inactivation than enterococci i e kmp of 0 270 cm2 mj and 0 229 cm2 mj respectively on the other hand no uv inactivation of pe2 microplastic associated e coli was seen while the observed inactivation of pe2 microplastic associated enterococci was slower than pvc microplastic associated enterococci i e kmp of 0 147 cm2 mj these findings suggest that the magnitude of the effect of microplastics on uv disinfection depended on the characteristics of both microplastics e g pe 40 48 µm and pvc 250 µm and bacteria gram negative e coli and gram positive enterococci which have structural differences such as the presence versus the absence of an outer lipid membrane respectively balachandran et al 2021 the model used herein could describe well all 3 regimes of the uv inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria in the presence of microplastics eq 2 i e initial resistance at lower uv fluences followed by a faster inactivation of free bacteria followed by tailing at higher uv fluences due to the slow inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria figs 2 and 3 importantly the microbial inactivation models eqs 1 and 2 predicted well the inactivation of the studied bacteria in both the absence and presence of microplastics r2 0 993 fig 5 the good prediction of the model allowed for the calculation of model predicted uv fluences to achieve 1 5 log reductions of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci in the absence and in the presence of pe1 pe2 or pvc microplastics the results are shown in table 3 in the case of pe1 microplastics where the uv fluence could not be corrected by the uvt higher uv fluences were required compared to the absence of microplastics for 2 5 log reductions of multidrug resistant e coli and 1 5 log reductions for multidrug resistant enterococci for pe2 and pvc microplastics where the uvt was incorporated in calculating uv fluence higher uv fluence requirements than the absence of microplastics were determined for 5 log reduction only which is related to the slower inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria than free bacteria for example to achieve a 5 log reduction the uv fluence requirement increased from 9 8 mj cm2 without microplastics to 17 5 mj cm2 with pvc microplastics for multidrug resistant e coli and from 14 5 mj cm2 without microplastics to 20 5 mj cm2 with pvc microplastics for multidrug resistant enterococci table 3 in the presence of pe2 microplastics a 5 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli was not calculated due to tailing i e no further reduction of bacteria was observed at a uv fluence 10 0 mj cm2 fig 2b and table 3 for a 5 log reduction of multidrug resistant enterococci 2 times higher uv fluence was required in the presence of pe2 microplastics than the absence of microplastics table 3 these results indicate that a certain uv fluence to achieve 5 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci in the absence of microplastics does not guarantee the same reduction of these bacteria in the presence of pe2 or pvc microplastics due to aggregation of bacteria with microplastics resulting in shielding bacteria from uv 4 conclusions the findings of this investigation allowed for the following conclusions microplastics negatively affected the uv inactivation kinetics of bacteria in water this was indicated by an additional inactivation regime in the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of both bacteria studied the additional regime which was observed after the initial resistance and fast inactivation of free bacteria was related to the slow or no inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria known as tailing effect the magnitude of the negative effect of microplastics on the uv disinfection performance varied with different microplastics pe2 40 48 µm and pvc 250 µm and bacteria multidrug resistant e coli gram negative and enterococci gram positive and was described well by a uv fluence based double exponential microbial inactivation model it was shown that when the uvt of the microplastic containing water was not taken into account in calculating uv fluence the effect of microplastics as protectors of bacteria was overestimated this is important considering that an accurate measurement of uvt of microplastic containing water is not trivial due to the unique behavior of microplastics in water i e deposited at the surface of water well mixed in water deposited at the bottom of the petri dish the findings suggest that microplastics may contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance in the environment in terms of lower uv inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the presence than in the absence of microplastics in water this paper is a proof of concept study on the effect of microplastics on the efficiency of uv disinfection of water i e microplastic associated bacteria exhibited slower uv inactivation than free bacteria the approach used herein to elucidate the effect of microplastics on the inactivation of bacteria may guide future research on the effect of other particles at the nano and micro size including nanoplastics and other engineered nanoparticles with different characteristics that have been studied for water treatment applications on the exposure response curve for the inactivation of various microorganisms by physical and chemical disinfecting agents in water wastewater it is worth noting that the effect of microplastics on the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of bacteria should eventually be evaluated in

15688,this study investigated the effect of polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics on the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci in ultrapure water at ph 6 0 0 1 in the absence of microplastics the uv inactivation of the studied bacteria exhibited an initial resistance followed by a faster inactivation of free dispersed bacteria while in the presence of microplastics these 2 regimes were followed by an additional regime of slower or no inactivation related to microplastic associated bacteria i e bacteria aggregated with microplastics resulting in shielding bacteria from uv indicated by tailing at higher uv fluences the magnitude of the negative effect of microplastics varied with different microplastics type particle size and bacteria gram negative and gram positive results showed that when the uv transmittance of the microplastic containing water was not taken into account in calculating uv fluences the effect of microplastics as protectors of bacteria was overestimated a uv fluence based double exponential microbial inactivation model accounting for both free and microplastic associated bacteria could describe well the disinfection data the present study elucidated the effect of microplastics on the performance of uv disinfection and the approach used herein to prove this concept may guide future research on the investigation of the possible effect of other particles including nanoplastics with different characteristics on the exposure response curve for the inactivation of various microorganisms by physical and chemical disinfection processes in different water and wastewater matrices graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics disinfection wastewater treatment antimicrobial resistance 1 introduction millions of tons of plastics are produced annually to meet the needs of modern society from which the majority ends up in landfills or the natural environment as plastic waste geyer et al 2017 this has resulted in the presence of plastics of different sizes in various environmental compartments worldwide ateia et al 2022 koelmans et al 2019 for example plastic debris at the micro size 1 5000 µm lim 2021 called microplastics have been detected globally in air gasperi et al 2018 soil boots et al 2019 scheurer and bigalke 2018 zhang and liu 2018 wastewater blair et al 2019 park et al 2020 seawater collignon et al 2012 drinking water and surface waters such as lakes and rivers koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2018 yonkos et al 2014 and are considered as emerging contaminants amato lourenço et al 2020 blair et al 2019 browne et al 2007 the presence of microplastics in various environmental matrices has initiated concerns related to their possible adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem campanale et al 2020 de souza machado et al 2018 green et al 2017 prata 2018 the last decade wastewater treatment plants wwtps received great attention as significant sources for microplastics in the aquatic environment cheng et al 2021 liu et al 2021 murphy et al 2016 park et al 2020 ziajahromi et al 2017 for this reason there was an increasing interest in investigating the presence of microplastics in wwtps for example microplastics of polyethelene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc have been detected in influents and effluents of wwtps worldwide 0 0 5 6 mg l cheng et al 2021 edo et al 2020 grbić et al 2020 park et al 2020 yang et al 2019 this indicates clearly that wwtps are a pathway for microplastics connecting the anthropogenic activity and the aquatic environment wei et al 2021 ziajahromi et al 2017 the detection of microplastics in both influents and effluents of wwtps suggests the presence of microplastics in all wastewater treatment stages and processes taking place in wwtps similar observations were reported for drinking water treatment plants and processes sarkar et al 2021 shen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the current study dealt with the effect of microplastics on water treatment performance recently the effect of microplastics on biological wastewater treatment processes was studied liu et al 2019 wei et al 2021 2019 zhang et al 2020 it was reported that in a short time of 2 h microplastics such as polyester pe and pvc do not affect significantly the activities of ammonium oxidizing bacteria nitrite oxidizing bacteria denitrifiers and polyphosphate accumulating organisms and hence it was concluded that microplastics do not affect the performance of biological wastewater treatment in terms of nitrogen and phosphorous removal efficiencies liu et al 2019 on the other hand in a longer time of 264 d pvc microplastics were reported to negatively affect the anaerobic granural sludge treatment process in terms of chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency and methane production zhang et al 2020 furthermore pe microplastics were shown to inhibit the aerobic and anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge due to the reduction of key bacteria through oxidative stress and or the release of toxic chemicals and due to the induction of reactive oxygen species respectively wei et al 2021 2019 other water treatment processes such as membrane filtration are also negatively affected by microplastics because of fouling mechanisms enfrin et al 2020 2019 li et al 2021 the present study focused on the effect of microplastics on the process of disinfection it is known that particles may affect the efficiency of uv disinfection by absorbing scattering and or blocking uv light resulting in lower amount of light available for disinfection reduced available uv energy and or shielding microorganisms respectively christensen and linden 2003 qualls et al 1983 for example it was reported that suspended particles in wastewater can negatively affect the uv inactivation of microorganisms by increasing the uv absorbance of the water and by shielding microorganisms from uv light christensen and linden 2003 emerick et al 1999 to this end the current study investigated if microplastics in water cause similar phenomena limited work has been done so far on the effect of microplastics on water disinfection efficiency enfrin et al 2019 to the best of the authors knowledge the only reported study on this topic evaluated the effect of 2 types of microplastics i e granular polyethylene microplastic and fibrous polyamide microplastic on the time based inactivation of e coli by ultraviolet uv irradiation and chlorine in water shen et al 2021 in this study the results were interpreted based on the exposure of bacteria to the disinfecting agent i e for uv disinfection the uv fluence mj cm2 which is the product of the average uv intensity mw cm2 and exposure time s and can be corrected with the uv transmittance uvt of the water matrix this is of utmost importance in differentiating between possible interaction of microplastics with uv at 254 nm which can be taken into account by correcting the uv fluence by the uvt of the water and interaction of microplastics with bacteria e g protection of bacteria by microplastics moreover the effect of other microplastics with different behavior in water e g pvc or pe of different particle size on the uv inactivation of other fecal indicator bacteria e g gram positive bacteria such as enterococci has not been investigated yet although microplastics were reported as hotspots of antibiotic resistance genes liu et al 2021 their effect on the uv inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria has not been studied so far these are important to better understand the impact of different microplastics on the performance of uv disinfection and their possible contribution to the spread of antibiotic resistance in water through lower inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria the present study investigated the effect of 3 microplastics on the uv inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci in ultrapure water at ph 6 0 0 1 and room temperature 25 1 c the objectives of the study were to i evaluate the effect of the concentration of microplastics on the uv inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci ii investigate the effect of polyethylene 125 µm deposited at the surface of water polyethylene 40 48 µm well mixed in water and polyvinyl chloride 250 µm deposited at the bottom of the petri dish microplastics on the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci iii explore and differentiate the effect of microplastics uv and microplastics bacteria interactions on uv disinfection performance iv develop a uv fluence based double exponential microbial inactivation model to predict the inactivation of free bacteria and microplastic associated bacteria and v calculate uv fluence requirements for 1 5 log reductions of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci in both the absence and presence of microplastics this paper is a proof of concept study that may guide future research on the investigation of the possible effect of different particles including nanoplastics with different characteristics on the exposure response curve for the inactivation of other microbial targets by physical and or chemical disinfection processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents polyethylene microplastics ultra high molecular weight surface modified powder average particle size 125 µm pe1 and particle size 40 48 µm pe2 were purchased from sigma aldrich mo usa polyvinyl chloride microplastics unplasticised powder particle size 250 µm pvc were purchased from goodfellow cambridge limited england uk the selection of polyethylene pe1 and pe2 and polyvinyl chlorine pvc plastics was based on their frequent detection in the environment alimi et al 2018 rochman et al 2013 the particle size of pe1 and pvc microplastics i e 125 µm and 250 µm respectively is within the particle size range of the microplastics with the highest abundance in wastewater i e 100 500 µm zhang et al 2020 the lower particle size of pe2 microplastics i e 40 48 µm allowed for better mixing and hence the incorporation of the uvt of the pe2 microplastic containing water in the calculation of uv fluence information about the microplastics used in the study is presented in table 1 details on other chemicals and reagents used in this study are given in text s1 2 2 multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci the e coli and enterococci bacteria were isolated from raw wastewater collected at the inlet of a wwtp in cyprus through the inoculation of 0 1 ml of wastewater on chromocult coliform agar cca and slanetz and bartley agar sba respectively which were spiked with the three antibiotics of interest i e trimethoprim ciprofloxacin and ampicillin followed by incubation at 44 c for 24 h for e coli and 37 c for 48 h for enterococci bacterial stocks of the cultivated multidrug resistant bacteria to the aforementioned antibiotics were recultivated on tryptic soy agar tsa prior to uv disinfection experiments 4 recultivated colonies were selected and inoculated into sterile tubes containing 10 ml of tryptic soy broth tsb and then incubated overnight at 37 c the formed pellet was collected by centrifugation at 3500 rcf for 15 min and then resuspended in a phosphate buffered saline pbs solution the initial concentration of antibiotic resistant bacteria spiked in water for disinfection experiments was in line with their concentration in wastewaters i e 104 105 cfu 100 ml balachandran et al 2021 pepper et al 2018 details regarding the selection of the concentrations of the antibiotics are given in text s2 2 3 uv disinfection experiments in the presence of microplastics a bench scale collimated beam apparatus trojan technologies trojanuv london ontario canada coupled with a low pressure uv lamp emitting at 254 nm was used to study the uv fluence based inactivation kinetics for multidrug resistant bacteria in the absence and in the presence of microplastics the petri factor which is the ratio of the average uv intensity over the area of the petri dish to the central uv intensity was determined as 0 91 indicating a well designed collimated beam apparatus bolton and linden 2003 experiments were conducted in milli q water at ph 6 0 0 1 and room temperature 25 1 c to prove the concept of the effect of microplastics on the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of bacteria ultrapure water milli q without buffer ph 6 0 was used to rule out a possible effect of wastewater constituents and or buffer ions on microplastics and or on the inactivation of bacteria and hence to ensure that the observed effect is only related to the interaction of microplastics with bacteria and or microplastics with uv light microplastics pe1 pe2 or pvc were individually added in a glass petri dish of external diameter of 6 0 cm and height of 3 5 cm followed by the addition of 59 95 ml water and the spiking of 0 05 ml of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci solution the concentration of microplastics was 0 25 1 0 g l which is in agreement with the concentrations of microplastics used in reported studies on the interaction between microplastics and chemical pollutants in water atugoda et al 2021 chen et al 2021 elizalde velázquez et al 2020 liu et al 2020 in addition to being in line with the aforementioned studies these concentrations of microplastics were used to have a measurable difference in uvt between water and microplastic containing water which is essential to prove the concept of the effect of microplastics on uv disinfection the solution containing bacteria and microplastics was stirred using magnetic stirrer for 2 h to allow a possible interaction between microplastics and bacteria then a 10 ml sample was taken to measure the uvt of the solution at 254 nm and the initial concentration of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci i e before their exposure to uv prior to exposing the water to uv the central uv intensity at the same height with the surface of the water was measured using a radiometer the distance from the surface of the water to the uv lamp was 45 cm to initiate a disinfection experiment the 50 ml solution was exposed to uv by placing the petri dish on a magnetic stirrer beneath the collimated beam experiments were performed at several uv fluences i e 0 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 8 5 10 0 12 5 15 0 and 18 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant e coli and 0 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 0 12 5 15 0 18 0 and 20 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant enterococci the required exposure time s to achieve the targeted uv fluence mj cm2 was calculated by the uvt of the water with or without microplastics the internal diameter of the petri dish 5 6 cm the volume of the solution 50 ml and the central uv intensity mw cm2 bolton and linden 2003 chowdhury et al 2020 venditto et al 2022 experiments were conducted in triplicate and the averages with standard deviations are presented the 95 prediction interval of the uv fluence based microbial inactivation kinetic model used in this study was calculated using sigmaplot software 2 4 analytical methods the cultivable multidrug resistant bacteria were enumerated by the membrane filtration method novo and manaia 2010 details on bacteria enumeration are given in text s3 the uvt of water at 254 nm was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer jasco v 530 and the uv intensity at 254 nm was recorded by a uvc light meter lutron electronic uvc 254a an ezdo pl 600 ph meter was used to measure the ph 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the concentration of microplastics on uv disinfection performance initially the effect of concentration of microplastics on the uv inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci was assessed experiments were performed at different concentrations of pe1 microplastics i e 0 25 g l 0 5 g l and 1 0 g l at a uv fluence of 10 0 mj cm2 and 15 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively the results in the presence of microplastics were compared with the results in the absence of microplastics control or 0 0 g l fig 1 shows no effect of pe1 microplastics on the uv inactivation of the studied bacteria at concentrations of 0 25 g l and 0 5 g l as the same reduction of bacteria in the presence and in the absence of microplastics was observed this was consistent for both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci figs 1a and b at the highest pe1 concentration used 1 0 g l the log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli decreased from 5 5 to 2 5 at 1 0 g l pe1 microplastics a lower disinfection performance was also observed for multidrug resistant enterococci i e the log reduction decreased from 5 5 without microplastics to 3 5 with microplastics these observations indicate a negative effect of microplastics on the uv disinfection performance which resulted in a 3 log and 2 log lower reduction of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively due to the presence of 1 0 g l pe1 microplastics compared with their absence it is worth noting that preliminary experiments showed no difference in the concentration of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci before without microplastics and after the 2 h mixing with microplastics figs s1a and b indicating no reduction of bacteria due to microplastics alone i e before their exposure to uv this shows clearly that microplastics at 1 0 g l affected negatively the performance of uv disinfection figs 1 and s1 this observation is in line with the known negative effect of suspended solids on the efficiency of uv disinfection of secondary effluent wastewater azimi et al 2012 it is also well documented in the literature that particles in water cause tailing phenomena at high uv fluences azimi et al 2012 to examine if microplastics cause a similar tailing effect experiments at different uv fluences were required 3 2 effect of uv fluence on uv disinfection performance in the presence of pe1 microplastics to evaluate the effect of uv fluence on the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci experiments were performed at different uv fluences i e 0 0 18 0 mj cm2 and 0 0 20 0 mj cm2 respectively in the absence and in the presence of pe1 microplastics for the tests in the presence of microplastics the concentration of pe1 microplastics was kept constant at 1 0 g l fig 1 the developed uv fluence response curves for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci in the absence and in the presence of pe1 microplastics are presented in figs 2 a and 3 a respectively lower inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli was observed in the presence than the absence of pe1 microplastics for example at a uv fluence of 8 5 mj cm2 the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli decreased from 3 5 log without microplastics to 2 0 log with microplastics fig 2a at the highest uv fluence applied in the absence of pe1 microplastics 10 0 mj cm2 the difference in inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli was the highest i e 2 5 log and 5 5 log reduction in the presence and in the absence of pe1 microplastics respectively a lower inactivation was also seen in the case of multidrug resistant enterococci the log reduction of multidrug resistant enterococci decreased from 3 5 to 2 0 at a uv fluence of 12 5 mj cm2 and from 5 5 to 3 5 at uv fluence of 15 0 mj cm2 in the absence and in the presence of pe1 microplastics respectively results of experiments at higher uv fluences in the presence of pe1 microplastics showed tailing effect i e a slower kinetic regime which has not been observed in the absence of microplastics figs 2a and 3a this tailing was observed for both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci the aforementioned negative effect of pe1 microplastics on the efficiency of the process of uv disinfection may be due to the interaction of microplastics with uv light i e consumption of the uv irradiation by microplastics and or the interaction of microplastics with bacteria i e bacteria aggregated with microplastics resulting in shielding bacteria from uv it should be noted that the uvt of water in the absence and in the presence of pe1 microplastics was similar i e 99 7 and 98 5 respectively table 1 the reason for this similarity in uvt is that pe1 microplastics have lower density than water i e 0 94 g ml versus 1 00 g ml causing pe1 microplastics to be deposited at the surface of the water in the cuvette and hence a similar measurement of uvt by the spectrophotometer was recorded this means that the interaction of pe1 microplastics and uv light was not captured during the uvt measurement and therefore it was not taken into account when calculating the uv fluence considering this we could not differentiate if the observed negative effect of pe1 microplastics on the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci was due to the interaction of pe1 microplastics with uv and or with bacteria it is known that the accurate measurement of uv fluence is important for the interpretation of results obtained by uv experiments almuhtaram et al 2021 the presence of particles in water generally increases the uv absorbance of water and hence decreases the uvt which is one of the factors affecting the uv fluence measurement christensen and linden 2003 however the effect of microplastics on the inactivation of bacteria in the domain of uv fluence corrected by the uvt of the microplastic containing water has not been investigated yet shen et al 2021 this is essential to elucidate the role of microplastics in decreasing the uv inactivation of bacteria in water and requires the use of a microplastic that allows for the incorporation of uvt in calculating the uv fluence 3 3 effect of pe2 microplastics on uv disinfection performance to get insights into the reason for the observed negative effect of microplastics on the uv disinfection performance an identical set of experiments was performed using a microplastic of lower particle size i e pe2 table 1 although the 2 polyethylene microplastics used in the study pe1 and pe2 have the same density the lower particle size of pe2 microplastics allowed for a good dispersion of the microplastics in water under mixing and the interaction of pe2 microplastics and uv light at 254 nm could be captured by the uvt measurement and used for the calculation of uv fluence i e uvt of 86 4 in the presence of pe2 microplastics and 99 7 in the absence of pe2 microplastics table 1 figs 2b and 3b show the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively in the presence of pe2 microplastics compared with the absence of pe2 microplastics a similar uv fluence based inactivation of the studied bacteria without and with pe2 microplastics was observed at a uv fluence range of 2 5 8 5 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant e coli and 2 5 12 5 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant enterococci interestingly the log reduction decreased at the highest uv fluence i e from 5 5 to 4 5 multidrug resistant e coli and from 5 5 log to 4 0 log multidrug resistant enterococci in the absence and in the presence of pe2 microplastics respectively a tailing was observed for both bacteria at higher uv fluences figs 2b and 3b considering that in the case of pe2 microplastics the interaction of microplastics and uv was taken into account by uvt table 1 the findings suggest that the 1 log lower inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and the 1 5 log lower inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci are due to a possible protection of bacteria by microplastics the aforementioned observation of the negative effect of pe2 microplastics indicates that only a small fraction of the multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci was associated with microplastics i e 1 log for e coli and 1 5 log for enterococci this is in agreement with the similar inactivation with and without pe2 microplastics at uv fluence 10 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant e coli and uv fluence 15 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant enterococci and the tailing effect at higher uv fluences i e free bacteria were inactivated first followed by a slower or no inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria this is in line with reported studies on the inactivation of fecal indicator bacteria e g e coli fecal coliforms and enterococci by several chemical disinfecting agents such as peracetic acid performic acid and ferrate vi where the small fraction of bacteria 1 2 log that was associated with particles such as total suspended solids in wastewaters i e particle associated bacteria exhibited slower exposure based inactivation than free dispersed bacteria indicated by tailing at higher exposure values campo et al 2020 maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2020 2019 this was also reported for the uv disinfection of wastewater containing suspended solids e g bioflocs azimi et al 2012 the results suggest a similar phenomenon in the case of microplastics i e the multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci aggregated with microplastics i e microplastic associated multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci resulting in shielding these bacteria from the uv irradiation leading to a slower inactivation than free bacteria it is worth noting that the differentiation between the two possible reasons for the negative effect of microplastics on uv disinfection can only be made in the domain of uv fluence corrected by the uvt of the water with or without microplastics this is important because the water containing pe2 microplastics has a lower uvt than the water without pe2 microplastics table 1 and therefore a longer exposure time is needed to deliver the same uv fluence in the presence than in the absence of pe2 microplastics to further elucidate this we performed experiments in the presence of pe2 microplastics where the uv fluence was calculated using the uvt of the water without pe2 microplastics uvtcontrol instead of the uvt in the presence of pe2 microplastics uvtpe2 and we compared the results with the ones obtained by the experiment without microplastics control based on the hypothesis of 2 different reasons for the negative effect of microplastics on uv disinfection i e microplastics uv and microplastics bacteria interactions this experiment should have given different results i e higher inactivation of bacteria at uvtpe2 than uvtcontrol since the first indicates the effect of pe2 bacteria interaction only and the later includes both the effects of pe2 uv and pe2 bacteria interactions results are shown in fig 4 when the uvtcontrol was used to calculate the uv fluence the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli decreased from 5 5 log to 3 5 log in the absence of pe2 microplastics control and in the presence of pe2 microplastics uvtcontrol respectively this 2 log difference in the reduction of bacteria is two times higher than the difference in inactivation when the uvtpe2 was used to calculate the uv fluence 1 log lower reduction from 5 5 log to 4 5 log fig 4a this suggests that the pe2 bacteria interaction i e protection of bacteria by pe2 microplastics and the pe2 uv interaction consumption of uv by pe2 microplastics are responsible for 1 log lower inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli each fig 4a this observation is consistent with the results obtained for multidrug resistant enterococci at uvtcontrol with pe2 microplastics a 2 log lower reduction than the absence of pe2 microplastics was observed while the inactivation decreased by 1 5 log at uvtpe2 fig 4b to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first time that the effect of microplastics on disinfection was clarified in this manner showing that microplastics may interact with bacteria in water and that these microplastic associated bacteria have slower inactivation kinetics compared with the free bacteria it was also clearly shown herein that no incorporation of the uvt in calculating the uv fluence may result in overestimation of the effect of microplastics as protectors of bacteria figs 4a and b 3 4 effect of pvc microplastics on uv disinfection performance to expand the study to another commonly found type of microplastic in water similar experiments were performed using pvc figs 2c and 3c show the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci respectively in the presence of pvc microplastics compared with their absence in the case of multidrug resistant e coli for up to a uv fluence of 8 5 mj cm2 no effect of pvc microplastics was observed interestingly at a higher uv fluence of 10 0 mj cm2 the inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli decreased from 5 5 log to 3 5 log due to the presence of pvc microplastics fig 2c a similar trend was observed for the inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci i e no effect of pvc microplastics for up to 12 5 mj cm2 while at a uv fluence of 15 0 mj cm2 the inactivation of multidrug resistant enterococci decreased from 5 5 log to 4 5 log without and with pvc microplastics respectively fig 3c at higher uv fluences a tailing was observed for both multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci it should be noted that pvc microplastics had different behavior than pe microplastics in water i e pvc microplastics have higher density than water i e 1 38 g ml versus 1 00 g ml resulting in their deposition at the bottom of the petri dish that being said the observed effect of pvc microplastics on uv disinfection is due to a possible interaction of bacteria with pvc microplastics or protection of bacteria by pvc microplastics despite the fact that the measured uvt in the presence of pvc microplastics is similar to their absence i e 99 5 and 99 7 respectively table 1 since the uv irradiation occurs from the top to the bottom using a collimated beam the uv light may interact with the pvc microplastics only after it is transmitted through the water sample significantly the pvc results figs 2c and 3c are consistent with the results obtained using pe2 microplastics figs 2b and 3b where a negative effect of microplastics on the uv disinfection was only observed at a uv fluence of 10 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant e coli and 15 0 mj cm2 for multidrug resistant enterococci the results of both pe2 and pvc microplastics suggest that a fraction of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci was associated with microplastics leading to their slower inactivation than free bacteria which was indicated by a tailing effect this is consistent with the fact that no difference in the inactivation of the studied bacteria with and without pvc or pe2 microplastics was observed at uv fluence 8 5 mj cm2 for e coli and uv fluence 12 5 mj cm2 for enterococci i e rapid inactivation of free bacteria followed by a slower or no inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria figs 2 and 3 the results are in line with the slower uv inactivation of particle associated microorganisms than free microorganisms due to the presence for example of total suspended solids 1 2 µm in wastewater azimi et al 2012 christensen and linden 2003 emerick et al 2000 hu et al 2007 interestingly the magnitude of the effect of solids on the uv inactivation of bacteria varied with the size of the particles azimi et al 2012 taking this into account and considering that in the uv fluence domain the effect of microplastics on uv disinfection depends predominantly on the interaction of microplastics with bacteria i e microplastic associated bacteria the different effect of microplastics observed herein figs 2b c 3b and c may be due to either their different type i e polyethylene versus polyvinyl chloride or their different particle size i e 40 48 µm versus 250 µm or both 3 5 inactivation kinetic modeling in the absence and presence of microplastics in the absence of microplastics the uv inactivation of multidrug resistant e coli and enterococci which were free dispersed bacteria in water exhibited an initial resistance followed by a faster inactivation figs 2 and 3 to describe both inactivation regimes a uv fluence based inactivation model that includes a parameter m describing initial resistance of bacteria to uv shoulder effects m 1 was used eq 1 balachandran et al 2021 haas and joffe 1994 1 n n 0 e k f uv fluence m where n0 and n are the concentrations of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci cfu 100 ml initially and after exposure to uv respectively uv fluence also known as uv dose is the exposure of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci to uv mj cm2 and kf is a uv fluence based inactivation rate constant for free multidrug resistant bacteria cm2 mj m in the presence of microplastics the aforementioned inactivation regimes were followed by a tailing phase i e a slower or no inactivation of the microplastic associated bacteria the biphasic behavior due to the different uv inactivation kinetics of free and microplastic associated bacteria was described with a uv fluence based double exponential microbial inactivation model eq 2 manoli et al 2019 santoro et al 2015 2 n n 0 1 β e k f uv fluence m β e k mp uv fluence where β is the fraction of the microplastic associated bacteria and kmp is a uv fluence based inactivation rate constant for microplastic associated multidrug resistant bacteria cm2 mj the inactivation model parameters kf and m in the absence of microplastics eq 1 and β kf m and kmp in the presence of microplastics eq 2 were fitted simultaneously by excel solver with the aim to minimize the difference between experimental and model predicted inactivation data the determined parameters are presented in table 2 interestingly a similar initial resistance was observed in the absence and in the presence of different microplastics for example at a uv fluence of 5 0 mj cm2 a log reduction of 1 was seen without and with microplastics for multidrug resistant e coli this was consistent for all microplastics used in the study i e pe1 pe2 and pvc microplastics significantly the initial resistance of multidrug resistant e coli to uv that was observed herein for up to 5 0 mj cm2 was in reasonable agreement with the initial resistance of e coli to uv of up to 4 0 mj cm2 without microplastics reported earlier sun et al 2016 in the case of multidrug resistant enterococci the initial resistance which was similar for all microplastics and without microplastics was up to 7 5 mj cm2 the findings suggest that the studied microplastics did not affect the initial resistance of bacteria to uv to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first study to draw the abovementioned conclusion this observation is in agreement with the inactivation model parameter m which was determined as higher than 1 in both the absence and the presence of microplastics indicating shoulder effects table 2 the phenomenon of initial resistance of bacteria to uv observed herein m 1 is in line with the initial resistance of bacteria to disinfecting agents in the absence of microplastics e g e coli fecal coliforms and enterococci to peracetic acid campo et al 2020 maffettone et al 2020 e coli fecal coliforms enterococci pseudomonas aeruginosa and total heterotrophs to ozone iakovides et al 2021 enterococci to performic acid maffettone et al 2020 and antibiotic resistant e coli and enterococci to peracetic acid balachandran et al 2021 campo et al 2020 phenomena of initial resistance were also reported for uv disinfection without microplastics e g e coli and bacillus subtilis spores hijnen et al 2006 sun et al 2016 this is not always the case though for example no shoulder effects were observed for the inactivation of fecal coliforms by ferrate vi manoli et al 2020 and murine norovirus did not exhibit initial resistance to uv peracetic acid ferrate vi and performic acid maffettone et al 2020 manoli et al 2020 the inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria by uv in water varied with different microplastics and bacteria figs 2 and 3 for example the pvc microplastic associated multidrug resistant e coli had faster inactivation than enterococci i e kmp of 0 270 cm2 mj and 0 229 cm2 mj respectively on the other hand no uv inactivation of pe2 microplastic associated e coli was seen while the observed inactivation of pe2 microplastic associated enterococci was slower than pvc microplastic associated enterococci i e kmp of 0 147 cm2 mj these findings suggest that the magnitude of the effect of microplastics on uv disinfection depended on the characteristics of both microplastics e g pe 40 48 µm and pvc 250 µm and bacteria gram negative e coli and gram positive enterococci which have structural differences such as the presence versus the absence of an outer lipid membrane respectively balachandran et al 2021 the model used herein could describe well all 3 regimes of the uv inactivation of multidrug resistant bacteria in the presence of microplastics eq 2 i e initial resistance at lower uv fluences followed by a faster inactivation of free bacteria followed by tailing at higher uv fluences due to the slow inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria figs 2 and 3 importantly the microbial inactivation models eqs 1 and 2 predicted well the inactivation of the studied bacteria in both the absence and presence of microplastics r2 0 993 fig 5 the good prediction of the model allowed for the calculation of model predicted uv fluences to achieve 1 5 log reductions of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci in the absence and in the presence of pe1 pe2 or pvc microplastics the results are shown in table 3 in the case of pe1 microplastics where the uv fluence could not be corrected by the uvt higher uv fluences were required compared to the absence of microplastics for 2 5 log reductions of multidrug resistant e coli and 1 5 log reductions for multidrug resistant enterococci for pe2 and pvc microplastics where the uvt was incorporated in calculating uv fluence higher uv fluence requirements than the absence of microplastics were determined for 5 log reduction only which is related to the slower inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria than free bacteria for example to achieve a 5 log reduction the uv fluence requirement increased from 9 8 mj cm2 without microplastics to 17 5 mj cm2 with pvc microplastics for multidrug resistant e coli and from 14 5 mj cm2 without microplastics to 20 5 mj cm2 with pvc microplastics for multidrug resistant enterococci table 3 in the presence of pe2 microplastics a 5 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli was not calculated due to tailing i e no further reduction of bacteria was observed at a uv fluence 10 0 mj cm2 fig 2b and table 3 for a 5 log reduction of multidrug resistant enterococci 2 times higher uv fluence was required in the presence of pe2 microplastics than the absence of microplastics table 3 these results indicate that a certain uv fluence to achieve 5 log reduction of multidrug resistant e coli or enterococci in the absence of microplastics does not guarantee the same reduction of these bacteria in the presence of pe2 or pvc microplastics due to aggregation of bacteria with microplastics resulting in shielding bacteria from uv 4 conclusions the findings of this investigation allowed for the following conclusions microplastics negatively affected the uv inactivation kinetics of bacteria in water this was indicated by an additional inactivation regime in the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of both bacteria studied the additional regime which was observed after the initial resistance and fast inactivation of free bacteria was related to the slow or no inactivation of microplastic associated bacteria known as tailing effect the magnitude of the negative effect of microplastics on the uv disinfection performance varied with different microplastics pe2 40 48 µm and pvc 250 µm and bacteria multidrug resistant e coli gram negative and enterococci gram positive and was described well by a uv fluence based double exponential microbial inactivation model it was shown that when the uvt of the microplastic containing water was not taken into account in calculating uv fluence the effect of microplastics as protectors of bacteria was overestimated this is important considering that an accurate measurement of uvt of microplastic containing water is not trivial due to the unique behavior of microplastics in water i e deposited at the surface of water well mixed in water deposited at the bottom of the petri dish the findings suggest that microplastics may contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance in the environment in terms of lower uv inactivation of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the presence than in the absence of microplastics in water this paper is a proof of concept study on the effect of microplastics on the efficiency of uv disinfection of water i e microplastic associated bacteria exhibited slower uv inactivation than free bacteria the approach used herein to elucidate the effect of microplastics on the inactivation of bacteria may guide future research on the effect of other particles at the nano and micro size including nanoplastics and other engineered nanoparticles with different characteristics that have been studied for water treatment applications on the exposure response curve for the inactivation of various microorganisms by physical and chemical disinfecting agents in water wastewater it is worth noting that the effect of microplastics on the uv fluence response curve for the inactivation of bacteria should eventually be evaluated in

15689,previous studies mostly focused on the responses of anaerobic granular sludge ags to one kind of microplastics during wastewater treatment however a wide variety of microplastics has been detected in wastewater the multiple microplastics induced stress on ags and the effectively mitigating strategy still remain unavailable herein this work comprehensively excavated the influences of multiple microplastics i e polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp coexisting in the wastewater on ags system from macroscopic to microcosmic aspects experimental results illustrated that microplastics decreased ags granule size increased cell inactivation and caused deteriorative methane recovery from wastewater as such this study then put great emphasis on proposing a mitigating strategy using hydrochar and disclosing the role of hydrochar in overcoming the stress induced by coexisting microplastics to ags system physiological characterization and microbial community analysis demonstrated that hydrochar effectively mitigated the reductions in methane production by 50 6 and cell viability by 68 8 of microplastics bearing ags and reduced the toxicity of microplastics to microbial community in the ags mechanisms investigation by fluorescence tagging and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy with fluorescence regional integration eem fri analysis revealed that hydrochar adsorbed accumulated microplastics and enhanced microplastics bearing ags to secrete extracellular polymeric substance eps with more humic acid generation thus reducing the direct contact between microplastics and ags in addition hydrochar weakened the ags intracellular oxidative stress induced by microplastics thereby completely eliminating the inhibition of microplastics on acidification efficiency of ags and partially mitigating the suppression on methanation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords multiple microplastics anaerobic granular sludge hydrochar overcoming adsorption inhibition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic digestion has been used globally in industrial domestic wastewater treatment for decades which is economically beneficial due to low energy consumption but considerable renewable energy recovery in the form of biogas ge et al 2010 latif et al 2011 extensive laboratorial experiments on various sources of wastewaters have been conducted based on anaerobic floc sludge kyazze et al 2006 zhang et al 2006 however anaerobic floc sludge possessed no qualifications to retain biomass with a high level because of its poor settleability shin et al 2019 this might cause a critical problem in the capability and stability of wastewater treatment application of anaerobic granular sludge ags represents an efficient solution to overcome this problem ags is an aggregate of microbial community with multilayered architecture that typically includes billions of individual cells of different species pol et al 2004 in comparison with anaerobic floc sludge ags has a high settling velocity to keep high biomass concentration and allows for a high organic loading rate due to its intrinsic structure akutsu et al 2009 recently ags technology has been successfully introduced to the treatment of diverse types of organic wastewater e g food beet sugar and papermaking industry wastewater showing great abilities to remove high strength soluble organics and recover energy jules and lier 2008 lim et al 2014 kongjan et al 2019 salem et al 2017 normally wastewater is regarded as the collection of various compounds including not only lots of organic matter but also various pollutants wastewater treatment by ags as a biological process is dependent on numerous anaerobic microbes in ags and thus is likely to be controlled by various existing pollutants in the wastewater the effects of the emerging pollutants such as metal oxide nanoparticles single multi wall carbon nanotubes and azo dyes have been of special interest in wastewater treatment of ags ambuchi et al 2017 dai et al 2016 he et al 2017 li et al 2015 mu et al 2012 in fact owing to the mass production and extensive application of plastic products a large amount of microplastics e g polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc also enters industrial domestic wastewater murphy et al 2016 drawing much attention due to their potential environmental risk according to the literature a dose dependent inhibition on ags ability was observed when exposed to pet microplastics zhang et al 2020a high concentration of pet microplastics induced toxicity toward anaerobic microorganisms in ags causing massive cell death moreover exposure to pvc microplastics has also been proven to decrease cod removal and methane production from wastewater by ags which was associated with the accumulation of microplastics on ags zhang et al 2020b considering the negative impacts of these microplastics on ags it is of paramount importance to find effective ways to reduce the direct contact between microplastics and ags in the wastewater thereby alleviating microplastic negative impacts research on potential use of material in adsorbing microplastics is only at the very early stage a recent case study wang et al 2020 has demonstrated that biochar exhibited a high adsorption efficiency and potential for microplastics in the wastewater owing to its porous structure with a variety of functional groups however biochar production requires high energy input but low in yield because of high carbonization temperature 300 700 c creamer et al 2014 wang et al 2017 distinct from biochar hydrochar is prepared in a closed water mixture under mild conditions 180 260 c guo et al 2017 this hydrothermal carbonization process makes hydrochar form porous structure and provides abundant functional groups as a cost effective novel material hydrochar has been used extensively in soil amendment and contaminants adsorption such as volatile organic compounds heavy metals dyes and pharmaceuticals fang et al 2018 fernandez et al 2015 gronwald et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2014 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge little information is currently available on the potential use of hydrochar in adsorbing microplastics and thus overcoming the potential microplastics induced impacts on microbial processes previous studies mostly focused on the impacts of sole kind of microplastics on ags during wastewater treatment actually a wide variety of microplastics were detected in wastewater as such this work comprehensively investigated the impacts of multiple microplastics i e pet ps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp typically coexisting in the wastewater on ags system during wastewater treatment more importantly this work aimed to explore whether hydrochar can be utilized to overcome coexisting microplastic induced stress on ags performance furthermore the mechanisms of hydrochar interacting with microplastics to reduce their biotoxicity toward ags were elucidated in detail based on various biochemical methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 microparticles sources and hydrochar preparation four kinds of microplastics typically coexisting in wastewater i e pet ps pe and pp used in this study were obtained from zhongcheng co ltd since the size of microplastics mostly detected in wastewater was 100 200 μm xu et al 2019 the collected microplastics were white sphere with the size of 150 μm hydrochar for experiment was prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of corn stover briefly corn stover was dried and cut up 2 mm then was soaked in the deionized water with the mass ratio of 1 10 and placed into a pressurized reactor at 260 for 60 min after reactor cooling hydrochar was harvested through vacuum filtration and washed using tetrahydrofuran 10 ml g hydrochar to remove bio oil attached on it finally hydrochar was dried and ground into particle for usage 2 2 effects of microplastics on ags performance and its mitigation by hydrochar microplastics exposure tests were achieved in an array of serum bottles contained with synthetic wastewater whose components were as mentioned in the supporting information si each bottle was inoculated 2g tss l of ags being obtained from a laboratorial up flow anaerobic sludge blanket the pet ps pe and pp have been detected in the real wastewater with the proportion of 36 15 42 and 8 respectively ziajahromi et al 2017 in this study therefore 75 mg l of pet 36 ps 15 pe 42 and pp 8 was added in the exposure group to assess the impacts of coexisting microplastics in contrast control group was with no microplastics addition each bottle was flushed with n2 to empty o2 sealed and incubated at 35 the cumulative ch4 production in each bottle was monitored until it stopped rising the ch4 production was determined by biogas composition and volume as detailed in the si according to our previous publication wei et al 2018 at the end the effluent of each case was characterized via excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra duetta horiba canada mitigation test was conducted using the mitigation group in which 75 mg l of microplastics and 2 g l of hydrochar were initially added in the ags system other procedures were the same as microplastics exposure group besides to confirm whether ags performance was affected by hydrochar hydrochar group was also performed by only dosing hydrochar in the ags system each group had three repetitions in this study 2 3 ags characterization and microbial community analysis size distribution of ags samples from each case was analyzed by a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 uk the percentages of live and dead cells in ags were measured by using live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 as the methods described in the si scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6700f japan as detailed in the si was applied to accomplish the observation of the ags morphology microbial community in ags was analyzed through illumina miseq sequencing as described in the si the eps in ags was extracted using heating method according to mu et al 2012 briefly after sifting the water ags was washed with nacl solution 0 05 for three times the ags was then resuspended in nacl solution 20 ml and heated at 60 for 30 min the eps were obtained by filtering through 0 45 μm membrane excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra were analyzed to characterize the eps of ags in detail the eps extracted from each case was diluted 5 times prior to the comparison of eem fluorescence spectra with the normalized fluorescence regional integration fri analysis being utilized to identify the components of eps quantitatively kang et al 2015 the normalized integration volume φ i beneath each fluorescence region of eem spectra was calculated to measure the cumulative fluorescence response of organics substances in eps extraction solutions which can be obtained by the eq 1 1 φ i e x e m i λ e x λ e m δ λ e x δ λ e m where δ λ e x refers to the excitation wavelength interval 5 nm in this work δ λ e m refers to the emission wavelength interval 5 nm in this work and i λ e x λ e m is the fluorescence intensity au at each excitation emission wavelength pair 2 4 evaluation on physicochemical characteristics of hydrochar the chemical composition of hydrochar prepared was measured by x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf delta premium usa brunauer emmett teller bet method was applied to analyzed bet surface area total volume of pores and average diameter of pares of hydrochar the functional groups in hydrochar were visualized by fourier transform infrared spectroscope ftir nexus 870 2 5 visualization of microplastics accumulating on the ags and hydrochar the absorption and accumulation of microplastics on the ags and hydrochar were visualized through fluorescence tagging method erni cassola et al 2017 briefly nile red solution was obtained by dissolving nile red n3013 sigma aldrich in methanol with 1 μg ml the ags or hydrochar sample was placed on a standard glass slide and then covered by the prepared nile red solution 2 3 drops the stained sample was put in dark at 60 c for 10 min then observed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope equipped with an annex digital camera zeiss axioskop 40 at the wavelength of 460 excitation nm and 525 emission nm 2 6 measurement of stress induced by ros generation reactive oxygen species ros as an indicator can reflect the level of oxidative stress the concentration of lactate dehydrogenase ldh released into the extracellular environment indicates the integrity of cell membrane thus intracellular ros level and extracellular ldh concentration at the end of test in each group were measured to examine the stress induced by microplastics and hydrochar s mitigation role the assay methods of ros and ldh levels were shown in si 2 7 determination of hydrochar affecting acidification and methanation of microplastics bearing ags model intermediates were used to subsequently explore the impacts of hydrochar on the two key steps i e acidification and methanation of wastewater treatment by ags exposed to microplatics experimental procedure of acidification impact test was similar to that of mitigation tests above except for the addition of 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid besa 50 mmol l to suppress the possible interference of methanation process the concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfa after 2 days were measured according to the method described in the si to indicate the role of hydrochar in affecting acidification of microplastics bearing ags sodium acetate was used as model intermediate to conduct methanation impact test which also was the similar with that of alleviation test above except that glucose 2000 mg cod l in synthetic wastewater was replaced by sodium acetate methane production after 8 days was determined to evaluate the hydrochar function in methanation process 3 results 3 1 response of ags to multiple microplastics induced stress the ags was exposed to wastewater with coexisting microplastics i e pet ps pe and pp to evaluate the influences of microplastics on ags ability as revealed by alterations in methane production from wastewater the comparisons in cumulative methane production between ags and microplastics bearing ags during the whole microplastic exposure test were presented in fig 1 a inhibition of cumulative methane production from wastewater by microplastics was clearly observed inhibition degree of cumulative methane production of ags dynamically increased with the prolonging of microplastic exposure time in the control without the presence of microplastics cumulative methane production from wastewater remained stable over 17 days anaerobic treatment after 17 days exposure coexisting microplastics exhibited a highest inhibition rate of 15 9 0 1 on methane production of ags besides the effluent from ags system with and without microplastic exposure was characterized by eem fluorescence spectra and shown in fig 1b it is reported that soluble microbial byproduct like substances are representative in region i ex em 250 450 280 380 nm while non biodegradable humic acid like substances locate in region ii ex em 250 450 380 600 nm chen et al 2003 the effluent from ags system with microplastic exposure contained more soluble microbial byproduct like substances compared to that in the control these soluble microbial byproduct like substances probably were the remaining glucose and intermediate metabolites that were not converted to methane this indicated that microplastic exposure suppressed the conversion of cod to methane which aligned with the methane production results variations in physical and physiological properties of microplastics bearing ags were also evaluated on the basis of granule size and live dead cells amounts specially the size distribution of ags in fig 1c showed that granule size of microplastics bearing ags moved toward the smaller size compared to control ags table s1 in si listed the medium particle diameter dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter calculated from size distribution profiles after microplastic exposure ags exhibited significant decreases in both dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter of 1128 23 p 5 9e 05 and 1165 17 μm p 1 67e 05 compared to control ags having the dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter of 1434 19 and 1546 21 μm the toxicity of microplastics toward microorganisms in ags was assayed by live dead staining test as seen in fig 1d reduction in live cells and increase in dead cells were examined upon microplastic exposure which explained why microplastics bearing ags biological ability for wastewater treatment decreased 3 2 hydrochar mitigated the inhibited performance of microplastics bearing ags the potential capacity of hydrochar in alleviating the toxicity of microplastics to ags was evaluated in fig 2 a hydrochar without microplastic exposure posed no obvious effect on methane production by ags and thus served as a reference control to exclude the impact of hydrochar itself in hydrochar amendment with microplastic exposure the reduction in methane production was also observed but reduction rate was less than the only microplastics treated ags throughout the whole microplastic exposure period 7 9 0 1 production of methane was decreased in microplastics bearing ags system along with hydrochar amendment this reduction is almost one half in microplastics bearing ags without hydrochar 15 9 0 1 in addition to the impact on methane production hydrochar caused phenotypic changes in morphology and cell viability of microplastics bearing ags fig 2b c as seen in sem images fig 2c control ags showed a smooth and solid shape while microplastics made granule smaller and even broken hydrochar amendment reduced granule breakage and only a fine fissure appeared on the surface of microplastics bearing ags different structural features of ags also were observed at greater magnification although ags in all case was colonized by considerable cocci bacillus and thin filament microcolony microplastics reduced the amount of thin filament microcolony in ags which was considered as methanogens macleod et al 1990 besides control ags was densely packed aggregate but microplastics induced granule to become loose in comparison to microplastics bearing ags it was observed that increased thin filament microcolony colonized in microplastics bearing ags with hydrochar amendment which appeared to be a little more compacted in case of live dead cells in ags shown in fig 2b microplastics increased dead cells in ags from 4 3 0 1 control to 16 2 0 4 whereas hydrochar addition decreased dead cells to 8 0 0 2 these finds suggested that hydrochar effectively reduce the negative impacts of microplastics on ags the ags ability for wastewater treatment is generally closely linked to its microbial community composition the differences of the microbiome results in the control ags and microplastics bearing ags with and without hydrochar amendment were analyzed by illumina sequencing technique and presented in fig 3 fig 3a showed principal coordinate analysis pcoa profile in accordance to unweighted unifrac distances with pc1 and pc2 representing 93 02 and 5 75 of the variance respectively a clear shift was observed in microbial community of the control ags microplastics bearing ags as well as microplastics bearing ags with hydrochar amendment but microbial community in microplastics bearing ags with hydrochar amendment was closer to that in control ags compared to microplastics bearing ags the microbial community distributions on the phylum level were displayed in fig 3b archaea were the dominant microbes in control ags with the proportion of about 58 6 microplastics exposure remarkably reduced archaea abundance to 33 1 while hydrochar amendment recovered archaea abundance to 50 4 it is well known that methanogens belong to archaea this indicated that microplastics induced toxicity to methanogens which would be mitigated by hydrochar the most abundant bacterial phyla in three groups of ags were chloroflexi bacteroidota caldatribacteriota firmicutes and actinobacteriota these dominant phyla accounted for 78 1 67 4 and 71 5 of the total bacterial community in control ags microplastics bearing ags and microplastics bearing ags with hydrochar amendment respectively most of these bacterial phyla are functional in the degradation of organic substances with the vfa and h2 production ariesyady et al 2007 zheng et al 2013 this result suggested that microplastics had negative impact on microorganisms possibly related to organics degradation but hydrochar partially alleviated this negative impact the similar trends in microbial shift at the genus level were also observed in fig 3c showing that microplastics decreased the relative abundances of specific key microbial genus associated with acidification and methanation but hydrochar addition could decrease their reduction for instance the most dominant methanogen was methanobacterium sp which is known as hydrogenotrophic methanogen sundberg et al 2013 a reduction of 39 1 and 18 9 was observed in the microplastics bearing ags without and with hydrochar compared to control ags similarly candidatus caldatribacterium which was considered as organics degrader with vfas production ao et al 2019 was also less abundant in the microplastics bearing ags than control ags in contrast hydrochar addition partially increased its abundance in the microplastics bearing ags the results in both microbial community diversity and composition attested to the role of hydrochar in mitigating the toxicity of microplastics to ags 3 3 adsorption characteristics of microplastics on ags and hydrochar to further explore how hydrochar alleviated the microplastics stress to ags hydrochar were characterized by xrf bet and sem quantitative chemical analysis in table 1 presented that hydrochar was mainly comprised by c 81 5 and o 16 3 elements with a small number of other elements i e k 1 3 cl 0 4 si 0 2 s 0 2 p 0 03 ca 0 03 and fe 0 01 etc the hysteresis loops in the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were shown in fig s1 demonstrating that hydrochar had porous structure whose average pore diameter was 25 5 nm bet surface area and total volume of pores were calculated as 5 7 m2 g and 0 04 cm3 g the morphological observation in sem images fig 4 a also showed that the surface of the hydrochar was porous probably providing abundant adsorption sites for microplastics overall such porous structure with high surface area would make hydrochar possess adsorption potential for microplastics to confirm the adsorption capacity of hydrochar for microplastics ags and hydrochar were collected from microplastics bearing ags with hydrochar amendment reactor at the end of test the microplastics on ags and hydrochar were observed as fluorescence images in fig 4b c obviously both ags and hydrochar surfaces were covered by lots of microplastics with red fluorescence but the amount of microplastics adsorbed and accumulated on hydrochar seemed more than that on ags ftir spectra in the wavenumber range of 500 4000 cm 1 of hydrochar before and after microplastic exposure in fig 4d further disclosed the adsorption of microplastics on hydrochar it can be seen that hydrochar processed abundant functional groups two distinct and sharp peaks at 3322 cm 1 and 2902 cm 1 are classified as o h and c h groups respectively qiu et al 2014 ma et al 2014 the bands at 1679 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 stem from the stretching vibrations of co and n h or c n groups respectively deng and ting 2005 the peak at 1091 cm 1 is closely related to the deformation or vibration of c o c or c o groups chakravarty et al 2010 yang et al 2015 the peak shifts at these active functional groups were apparent regarding the ftir spectra of hydrochar exposed to microplastics revealing that the microplastics was adsorbed on hydrochar through the interaction with these functional groups 3 4 hydrochar stimulated eps secretion of microplastics bearing ags the eps excreted by microorganisms as an important component of ags are high molecular weight organic compounds eps normally adhered on the cell surface thereby building a barrier for protecting ags from the stress of adverse environment luongo and zhang 2010 sheng et al 2010 eps of ags from control ags and microplastics bearing ags with and without hydrochar amendment were extracted and characterized by eem fluorescence spectra the main fluorescence regions of eps in each case were presented in fig 5 a as mentioned above region i ex em 250 450 280 380 nm represents soluble microbial byproduct like substances region ii ex em 250 450 380 600 nm is on behalf of nonbiodegradable humic acid like substances these two components of eps located at each fluorescence region were quantified using fir analysis expressed as the normalized integration volume φ i as depicted in fig 5b the φ i values in both region i and region ii were strongly influenced under the shock of microplastics showing a reduction to the different extent compared to those of control ags several previous studies also found the quenching on fluorescence intensity of eps induced by the presence of metal ions and nanoparticles xu et al 2016 in contrast hydrochar with and without microplastic exposure enhanced the φ i values in both region i and region ii but the φ i values in these two regions in the case of hydrochar with microplastics exposure were highest these finds indicated that microplastic exposure restrained eps production of ags strikingly hydrochar itself can enhance ags to secrete eps and hydrochar and microplastics could synergistically further enhance eps production reinforcing the protection to ags it is reported liu et al 2020 that humic acid located at region ii could decrease microplastics affinity for cells by forming a corona on microplastics surface thereby effectively alleviating the adverse effect of microplastics thus hydrochar amendment largely increased humic acid generation of microplastics bearing ags probably weakening microplastics toxicity 3 5 hydrochar reduced the ros stress induced by microplastics pollutants with small particle size e g metal oxide nanoparticles microplastics and nanoplastics have been found to enable to adsorb on the cell surface and upregulating the intracellular ros even at the anaerobic environment mu and chen 2011 wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a it is elucidated that excessive intracellular ros enables to destroy cell membrane and trigger redox sensitive signaling pathways xia et al 2008 resulting in cytotoxicity and even the damages of cell viability xiao et al 2003 lab scale toxicology tests have demonstrated that excessive intracellular ros induced by micro nano plastics caused cytotoxicity towards algae anaerobe and invertebrate bhattacharya et al 2010 wei et al 2019 jeong et al 2016 in this study a 16 9 increase in the intracellular ros level was presented in fig 6 a when ags exposed to coexisting microplastics in contrast hydrochar itself had no effect on ros level in ags but its addition effectively mitigated the enhancement of intracellular ros level in ags induced by microplastics by 50 3 the concentration of ldh released out of the cell is commonly served as indicator of the integrity of cell membrane aligning with the change in intracellular ros level the results of extracellular ldh measurement revealed that microplastic exposure caused an increase in the amount of extracellular ldh however hydrochar amendment reduced the concentration of extracellular ldh in the microplastics bearing ags by 20 1 compared to that in the microplastics bearing ags without hydrochar addition the variations in both intracellular ros level and extracellular ldh concentration suggested that hydrochar was capable of serving as a remedial agent to alleviate the stress induced by ros to ags when exposed to multiple microplastics 3 6 hydrochar alleviated the microplastics suppressions on acidification and methanation of ags during wastewater treatment transformation of organic matter to methane by ags goes through two important biological processes they are acidification and methanation as such the efficiencies of these two individual steps determine the ultimate performance of wastewater treatment the impacts of hydrochar on acidification and methanation efficiencies of microplastics bearing ags were illustrated in fig 6b c for acidification step the presence of microplastics caused negative impact on its efficiencies compared to the control ags fig 6b representing a decrease of 16 9 however hydrochar itself enabled to improve acidification efficiency of ags when ags exposed to microplastics hydrochar addition mitigated the inhibition of microplastics to acidification step achieving the similar performance of ags in the control group without microplastic and hydrochar as seen in fig 6c an inhibitory effect on methanation step was also observed when ags exposed to microplastics the inhibition of microplastics on methanation 54 8 0 1 was significantly p 1 29e 10 stronger than acidification 16 9 0 1 indicating that methanogens were more susceptible to the toxicity of microplastics although hydrochar itself had insignificant p 0 4852 effect on methanation efficiency of ags when ags exposed to microplastics hydrochar addition could reduce the inhibition degree of microplastics to methanation efficiency showing 89 5 of ags methanation efficiency without microplastic exposure thus the positive effects of hydrochar on acidification and methanation steps of microplastics bearing ags likely contributed to great alleviation of overall performance of ags exposed to microplastics 4 discussion to date microplastics are widely spread in numerous water environments including surface water eriksen et al 2013 ground water ren et al 2021 oceans lusher et al 2014 rain abbasi 2021 and even sea ice kelly et al 2020 monitoring efforts have revealed that the abundant microplastics coexist in wastewater sun et al 2019 thus which is regarded to be a significant transmitter of microplastics from urban system into the aquatic environment carr et al 2016 this study emphasized the inhibition of co existing microplastics pet ps pe and pp in the wastewater on ags system for wastewater treatment for the first time to overcome the toxicity of microplastics to ags this study proposed an effective strategy based on hydrochar amendment the mitigation mechanisms could be explained by the following factors or any combination of these factors 1 the porous structure with abundant functional groups made hydrochar adsorb lots of microplastics on its surface reducing the direct contact between microplastics and ags 2 hydrochar enhanced ags to secrete eps reinforcing the protection to ags against microplastic disruption especially more humic acid in eps decreased microplastics affinity for cells weakening the toxicity of microplastics 3 intracellular oxidative stress in the microplastics bearing ags was mitigated by hydrochar amendment and 4 hydrochar amendment completely eliminated the inhibition of microplastics on acidification efficiency of ags and partially improved methanation efficiency of microplastics bearing ags carbon based materials have been successfully involved in mitigating the toxic impacts of environmental pollutants to plants via adsorption function for example biochar could bond cd and pb with its mineral phases to reduce cd level in rice tissues and pb content in root tissue which made a significant contribution to mitigate heavy metal pollution from rice agriculture bian et al 2014 abbas et al 2019 also found that biochar amendment effectively reduced the phyto toxic effect of agnps on rice growth by decreasing ag bioaccumulation in rice root and shoot tissues previous publications found that carbon based materials derived from different biomass sources had different capacity in adsorbing pollutants from aqueous systems nzediegwu et al 2021 taskin et al 2019 hence hydrochar produced from different feedstocks may possess different properties for microplastics adsorption additionally the production details of pyrolysis temperature and time are important determinants of micropores and surface functional groups sun et al 2014 since different types of microplastics coexist in the wastewater have diverse functional groups it is favorable to develop a sorbent that can capture all types of microplastics simultaneously as such optimization efforts would be needed to obtain a most efficient hydrochar to ensure the strongest adsorption capacity for various microplastics existence in the wastewater to reduce their accumulation on the ags surface note that there is no positive correlation between the hydrochar dosage and the pollutant removal percentage from the perspective of adsorption effect wu et al 2021 accordingly it would be essential to excavate the proper dosage of hydrochar in the system forming an economical way to mitigate microplastics toxicity notably material recycle is a necessary step for maintaining the reusability of hydrochar and reducing the subsequent risk of the adsorbed microplastics to the environment till now numerous efforts have been done to select the optimal regeneration method for carbon based materials which might be determined by the type of pollutant the stability of the material and the economic and energy costs the extensively applied techniques include filtration da na and awad 2017 solvent recycle jiang et al 2018 and thermal recycling hwang et al 2020 the mechanistic investigations regarding microplastics adsorption have attributed the relationship between carbon based materials and microplastics to hydrogen bond interactions π π interactions and electrostatic interactions wang et al 2021 thus the recovery of carbon based materials can be easily accomplished by being rinsed with solvent or being heated for microplastics desorption specially experimental results indicated that the carbon based materials that have been washed with ethanol to remove microplastics still maintained stable adsorption capability of microplastics compared to the freshly prepared materials sun et al 2020 similar to thermal treatment wang et al 2021 as such hydrochar particles adhered by microplastics would be recycled by being rinsed with solvent or being heated for microplastics desorption overall the hydrochar amendment is an economical and environmental friendly strategy in effectively mitigating the toxicity of microplastics to ags wastewater treatment systems 5 conclusion this study provided a first insight into the inhibitory effects of co existing multiple microplastics pet ps pe and pp in the wastewater on ags wastewater treatment system microplastics bearing ags showed decreased granule size increased cell inactivation and deteriorative methane recovery ability from wastewater hydrochar amendment effectively mitigated the reductions in menthane production granule size and cell viability of microplastics bearing ags and reduced the toxicity of microplastics to microbial community in the ags lots of microplastics adsorbed and accumulated on hydrochar surface due to its porous structure with abundance functional groups hydrochar enhanced the microplastics bearing ags to secrete eps with more humic acid generation intracellular ros level and extracellular ldh concentration in the microplastics bearing ags were also reduced by hydrochar amendment in addition hydrochar amendment completely eliminated the inhibition of multiple microplastics on acidification efficiency of ags whereas partially improved methanation efficiency of microplastics bearing ags declaration of

15689,previous studies mostly focused on the responses of anaerobic granular sludge ags to one kind of microplastics during wastewater treatment however a wide variety of microplastics has been detected in wastewater the multiple microplastics induced stress on ags and the effectively mitigating strategy still remain unavailable herein this work comprehensively excavated the influences of multiple microplastics i e polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp coexisting in the wastewater on ags system from macroscopic to microcosmic aspects experimental results illustrated that microplastics decreased ags granule size increased cell inactivation and caused deteriorative methane recovery from wastewater as such this study then put great emphasis on proposing a mitigating strategy using hydrochar and disclosing the role of hydrochar in overcoming the stress induced by coexisting microplastics to ags system physiological characterization and microbial community analysis demonstrated that hydrochar effectively mitigated the reductions in methane production by 50 6 and cell viability by 68 8 of microplastics bearing ags and reduced the toxicity of microplastics to microbial community in the ags mechanisms investigation by fluorescence tagging and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy with fluorescence regional integration eem fri analysis revealed that hydrochar adsorbed accumulated microplastics and enhanced microplastics bearing ags to secrete extracellular polymeric substance eps with more humic acid generation thus reducing the direct contact between microplastics and ags in addition hydrochar weakened the ags intracellular oxidative stress induced by microplastics thereby completely eliminating the inhibition of microplastics on acidification efficiency of ags and partially mitigating the suppression on methanation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords multiple microplastics anaerobic granular sludge hydrochar overcoming adsorption inhibition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic digestion has been used globally in industrial domestic wastewater treatment for decades which is economically beneficial due to low energy consumption but considerable renewable energy recovery in the form of biogas ge et al 2010 latif et al 2011 extensive laboratorial experiments on various sources of wastewaters have been conducted based on anaerobic floc sludge kyazze et al 2006 zhang et al 2006 however anaerobic floc sludge possessed no qualifications to retain biomass with a high level because of its poor settleability shin et al 2019 this might cause a critical problem in the capability and stability of wastewater treatment application of anaerobic granular sludge ags represents an efficient solution to overcome this problem ags is an aggregate of microbial community with multilayered architecture that typically includes billions of individual cells of different species pol et al 2004 in comparison with anaerobic floc sludge ags has a high settling velocity to keep high biomass concentration and allows for a high organic loading rate due to its intrinsic structure akutsu et al 2009 recently ags technology has been successfully introduced to the treatment of diverse types of organic wastewater e g food beet sugar and papermaking industry wastewater showing great abilities to remove high strength soluble organics and recover energy jules and lier 2008 lim et al 2014 kongjan et al 2019 salem et al 2017 normally wastewater is regarded as the collection of various compounds including not only lots of organic matter but also various pollutants wastewater treatment by ags as a biological process is dependent on numerous anaerobic microbes in ags and thus is likely to be controlled by various existing pollutants in the wastewater the effects of the emerging pollutants such as metal oxide nanoparticles single multi wall carbon nanotubes and azo dyes have been of special interest in wastewater treatment of ags ambuchi et al 2017 dai et al 2016 he et al 2017 li et al 2015 mu et al 2012 in fact owing to the mass production and extensive application of plastic products a large amount of microplastics e g polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps and polyvinyl chloride pvc also enters industrial domestic wastewater murphy et al 2016 drawing much attention due to their potential environmental risk according to the literature a dose dependent inhibition on ags ability was observed when exposed to pet microplastics zhang et al 2020a high concentration of pet microplastics induced toxicity toward anaerobic microorganisms in ags causing massive cell death moreover exposure to pvc microplastics has also been proven to decrease cod removal and methane production from wastewater by ags which was associated with the accumulation of microplastics on ags zhang et al 2020b considering the negative impacts of these microplastics on ags it is of paramount importance to find effective ways to reduce the direct contact between microplastics and ags in the wastewater thereby alleviating microplastic negative impacts research on potential use of material in adsorbing microplastics is only at the very early stage a recent case study wang et al 2020 has demonstrated that biochar exhibited a high adsorption efficiency and potential for microplastics in the wastewater owing to its porous structure with a variety of functional groups however biochar production requires high energy input but low in yield because of high carbonization temperature 300 700 c creamer et al 2014 wang et al 2017 distinct from biochar hydrochar is prepared in a closed water mixture under mild conditions 180 260 c guo et al 2017 this hydrothermal carbonization process makes hydrochar form porous structure and provides abundant functional groups as a cost effective novel material hydrochar has been used extensively in soil amendment and contaminants adsorption such as volatile organic compounds heavy metals dyes and pharmaceuticals fang et al 2018 fernandez et al 2015 gronwald et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2014 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge little information is currently available on the potential use of hydrochar in adsorbing microplastics and thus overcoming the potential microplastics induced impacts on microbial processes previous studies mostly focused on the impacts of sole kind of microplastics on ags during wastewater treatment actually a wide variety of microplastics were detected in wastewater as such this work comprehensively investigated the impacts of multiple microplastics i e pet ps polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp typically coexisting in the wastewater on ags system during wastewater treatment more importantly this work aimed to explore whether hydrochar can be utilized to overcome coexisting microplastic induced stress on ags performance furthermore the mechanisms of hydrochar interacting with microplastics to reduce their biotoxicity toward ags were elucidated in detail based on various biochemical methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 microparticles sources and hydrochar preparation four kinds of microplastics typically coexisting in wastewater i e pet ps pe and pp used in this study were obtained from zhongcheng co ltd since the size of microplastics mostly detected in wastewater was 100 200 μm xu et al 2019 the collected microplastics were white sphere with the size of 150 μm hydrochar for experiment was prepared by hydrothermal carbonization of corn stover briefly corn stover was dried and cut up 2 mm then was soaked in the deionized water with the mass ratio of 1 10 and placed into a pressurized reactor at 260 for 60 min after reactor cooling hydrochar was harvested through vacuum filtration and washed using tetrahydrofuran 10 ml g hydrochar to remove bio oil attached on it finally hydrochar was dried and ground into particle for usage 2 2 effects of microplastics on ags performance and its mitigation by hydrochar microplastics exposure tests were achieved in an array of serum bottles contained with synthetic wastewater whose components were as mentioned in the supporting information si each bottle was inoculated 2g tss l of ags being obtained from a laboratorial up flow anaerobic sludge blanket the pet ps pe and pp have been detected in the real wastewater with the proportion of 36 15 42 and 8 respectively ziajahromi et al 2017 in this study therefore 75 mg l of pet 36 ps 15 pe 42 and pp 8 was added in the exposure group to assess the impacts of coexisting microplastics in contrast control group was with no microplastics addition each bottle was flushed with n2 to empty o2 sealed and incubated at 35 the cumulative ch4 production in each bottle was monitored until it stopped rising the ch4 production was determined by biogas composition and volume as detailed in the si according to our previous publication wei et al 2018 at the end the effluent of each case was characterized via excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra duetta horiba canada mitigation test was conducted using the mitigation group in which 75 mg l of microplastics and 2 g l of hydrochar were initially added in the ags system other procedures were the same as microplastics exposure group besides to confirm whether ags performance was affected by hydrochar hydrochar group was also performed by only dosing hydrochar in the ags system each group had three repetitions in this study 2 3 ags characterization and microbial community analysis size distribution of ags samples from each case was analyzed by a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 uk the percentages of live and dead cells in ags were measured by using live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 as the methods described in the si scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6700f japan as detailed in the si was applied to accomplish the observation of the ags morphology microbial community in ags was analyzed through illumina miseq sequencing as described in the si the eps in ags was extracted using heating method according to mu et al 2012 briefly after sifting the water ags was washed with nacl solution 0 05 for three times the ags was then resuspended in nacl solution 20 ml and heated at 60 for 30 min the eps were obtained by filtering through 0 45 μm membrane excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectra were analyzed to characterize the eps of ags in detail the eps extracted from each case was diluted 5 times prior to the comparison of eem fluorescence spectra with the normalized fluorescence regional integration fri analysis being utilized to identify the components of eps quantitatively kang et al 2015 the normalized integration volume φ i beneath each fluorescence region of eem spectra was calculated to measure the cumulative fluorescence response of organics substances in eps extraction solutions which can be obtained by the eq 1 1 φ i e x e m i λ e x λ e m δ λ e x δ λ e m where δ λ e x refers to the excitation wavelength interval 5 nm in this work δ λ e m refers to the emission wavelength interval 5 nm in this work and i λ e x λ e m is the fluorescence intensity au at each excitation emission wavelength pair 2 4 evaluation on physicochemical characteristics of hydrochar the chemical composition of hydrochar prepared was measured by x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf delta premium usa brunauer emmett teller bet method was applied to analyzed bet surface area total volume of pores and average diameter of pares of hydrochar the functional groups in hydrochar were visualized by fourier transform infrared spectroscope ftir nexus 870 2 5 visualization of microplastics accumulating on the ags and hydrochar the absorption and accumulation of microplastics on the ags and hydrochar were visualized through fluorescence tagging method erni cassola et al 2017 briefly nile red solution was obtained by dissolving nile red n3013 sigma aldrich in methanol with 1 μg ml the ags or hydrochar sample was placed on a standard glass slide and then covered by the prepared nile red solution 2 3 drops the stained sample was put in dark at 60 c for 10 min then observed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope equipped with an annex digital camera zeiss axioskop 40 at the wavelength of 460 excitation nm and 525 emission nm 2 6 measurement of stress induced by ros generation reactive oxygen species ros as an indicator can reflect the level of oxidative stress the concentration of lactate dehydrogenase ldh released into the extracellular environment indicates the integrity of cell membrane thus intracellular ros level and extracellular ldh concentration at the end of test in each group were measured to examine the stress induced by microplastics and hydrochar s mitigation role the assay methods of ros and ldh levels were shown in si 2 7 determination of hydrochar affecting acidification and methanation of microplastics bearing ags model intermediates were used to subsequently explore the impacts of hydrochar on the two key steps i e acidification and methanation of wastewater treatment by ags exposed to microplatics experimental procedure of acidification impact test was similar to that of mitigation tests above except for the addition of 2 bromoethanesulfonic acid besa 50 mmol l to suppress the possible interference of methanation process the concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfa after 2 days were measured according to the method described in the si to indicate the role of hydrochar in affecting acidification of microplastics bearing ags sodium acetate was used as model intermediate to conduct methanation impact test which also was the similar with that of alleviation test above except that glucose 2000 mg cod l in synthetic wastewater was replaced by sodium acetate methane production after 8 days was determined to evaluate the hydrochar function in methanation process 3 results 3 1 response of ags to multiple microplastics induced stress the ags was exposed to wastewater with coexisting microplastics i e pet ps pe and pp to evaluate the influences of microplastics on ags ability as revealed by alterations in methane production from wastewater the comparisons in cumulative methane production between ags and microplastics bearing ags during the whole microplastic exposure test were presented in fig 1 a inhibition of cumulative methane production from wastewater by microplastics was clearly observed inhibition degree of cumulative methane production of ags dynamically increased with the prolonging of microplastic exposure time in the control without the presence of microplastics cumulative methane production from wastewater remained stable over 17 days anaerobic treatment after 17 days exposure coexisting microplastics exhibited a highest inhibition rate of 15 9 0 1 on methane production of ags besides the effluent from ags system with and without microplastic exposure was characterized by eem fluorescence spectra and shown in fig 1b it is reported that soluble microbial byproduct like substances are representative in region i ex em 250 450 280 380 nm while non biodegradable humic acid like substances locate in region ii ex em 250 450 380 600 nm chen et al 2003 the effluent from ags system with microplastic exposure contained more soluble microbial byproduct like substances compared to that in the control these soluble microbial byproduct like substances probably were the remaining glucose and intermediate metabolites that were not converted to methane this indicated that microplastic exposure suppressed the conversion of cod to methane which aligned with the methane production results variations in physical and physiological properties of microplastics bearing ags were also evaluated on the basis of granule size and live dead cells amounts specially the size distribution of ags in fig 1c showed that granule size of microplastics bearing ags moved toward the smaller size compared to control ags table s1 in si listed the medium particle diameter dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter calculated from size distribution profiles after microplastic exposure ags exhibited significant decreases in both dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter of 1128 23 p 5 9e 05 and 1165 17 μm p 1 67e 05 compared to control ags having the dv 0 5 and mean volume diameter of 1434 19 and 1546 21 μm the toxicity of microplastics toward microorganisms in ags was assayed by live dead staining test as seen in fig 1d reduction in live cells and increase in dead cells were examined upon microplastic exposure which explained why microplastics bearing ags biological ability for wastewater treatment decreased 3 2 hydrochar mitigated the inhibited performance of microplastics bearing ags the potential capacity of hydrochar in alleviating the toxicity of microplastics to ags was evaluated in fig 2 a hydrochar without microplastic exposure posed no obvious effect on methane production by ags and thus served as a reference control to exclude the impact of hydrochar itself in hydrochar amendment with microplastic exposure the reduction in methane production was also observed but reduction rate was less than the only microplastics treated ags throughout the whole microplastic exposure period 7 9 0 1 production of methane was decreased in microplastics bearing ags system along with hydrochar amendment this reduction is almost one half in microplastics bearing ags without hydrochar 15 9 0 1 in addition to the impact on methane production hydrochar caused phenotypic changes in morphology and cell viability of microplastics bearing ags fig 2b c as seen in sem images fig 2c control ags showed a smooth and solid shape while microplastics made granule smaller and even broken hydrochar amendment reduced granule breakage and only a fine fissure appeared on the surface of microplastics bearing ags different structural features of ags also were observed at greater magnification although ags in all case was colonized by considerable cocci bacillus and thin filament microcolony microplastics reduced the amount of thin filament microcolony in ags which was considered as methanogens macleod et al 1990 besides control ags was densely packed aggregate but microplastics induced granule to become loose in comparison to microplastics bearing ags it was observed that increased thin filament microcolony colonized in microplastics bearing ags with hydrochar amendment which appeared to be a little more compacted in case of live dead cells in ags shown in fig 2b microplastics increased dead cells in ags from 4 3 0 1 control to 16 2 0 4 whereas hydrochar addition decreased dead cells to 8 0 0 2 these finds suggested that hydrochar effectively reduce the negative impacts of microplastics on ags the ags ability for wastewater treatment is generally closely linked to its microbial community composition the differences of the microbiome results in the control ags and microplastics bearing ags with and without hydrochar amendment were analyzed by illumina sequencing technique and presented in fig 3 fig 3a showed principal coordinate analysis pcoa profile in accordance to unweighted unifrac distances with pc1 and pc2 representing 93 02 and 5 75 of the variance respectively a clear shift was observed in microbial community of the control ags microplastics bearing ags as well as microplastics bearing ags with hydrochar amendment but microbial community in microplastics bearing ags with hydrochar amendment was closer to that in control ags compared to microplastics bearing ags the microbial community distributions on the phylum level were displayed in fig 3b archaea were the dominant microbes in control ags with the proportion of about 58 6 microplastics exposure remarkably reduced archaea abundance to 33 1 while hydrochar amendment recovered archaea abundance to 50 4 it is well known that methanogens belong to archaea this indicated that microplastics induced toxicity to methanogens which would be mitigated by hydrochar the most abundant bacterial phyla in three groups of ags were chloroflexi bacteroidota caldatribacteriota firmicutes and actinobacteriota these dominant phyla accounted for 78 1 67 4 and 71 5 of the total bacterial community in control ags microplastics bearing ags and microplastics bearing ags with hydrochar amendment respectively most of these bacterial phyla are functional in the degradation of organic substances with the vfa and h2 production ariesyady et al 2007 zheng et al 2013 this result suggested that microplastics had negative impact on microorganisms possibly related to organics degradation but hydrochar partially alleviated this negative impact the similar trends in microbial shift at the genus level were also observed in fig 3c showing that microplastics decreased the relative abundances of specific key microbial genus associated with acidification and methanation but hydrochar addition could decrease their reduction for instance the most dominant methanogen was methanobacterium sp which is known as hydrogenotrophic methanogen sundberg et al 2013 a reduction of 39 1 and 18 9 was observed in the microplastics bearing ags without and with hydrochar compared to control ags similarly candidatus caldatribacterium which was considered as organics degrader with vfas production ao et al 2019 was also less abundant in the microplastics bearing ags than control ags in contrast hydrochar addition partially increased its abundance in the microplastics bearing ags the results in both microbial community diversity and composition attested to the role of hydrochar in mitigating the toxicity of microplastics to ags 3 3 adsorption characteristics of microplastics on ags and hydrochar to further explore how hydrochar alleviated the microplastics stress to ags hydrochar were characterized by xrf bet and sem quantitative chemical analysis in table 1 presented that hydrochar was mainly comprised by c 81 5 and o 16 3 elements with a small number of other elements i e k 1 3 cl 0 4 si 0 2 s 0 2 p 0 03 ca 0 03 and fe 0 01 etc the hysteresis loops in the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were shown in fig s1 demonstrating that hydrochar had porous structure whose average pore diameter was 25 5 nm bet surface area and total volume of pores were calculated as 5 7 m2 g and 0 04 cm3 g the morphological observation in sem images fig 4 a also showed that the surface of the hydrochar was porous probably providing abundant adsorption sites for microplastics overall such porous structure with high surface area would make hydrochar possess adsorption potential for microplastics to confirm the adsorption capacity of hydrochar for microplastics ags and hydrochar were collected from microplastics bearing ags with hydrochar amendment reactor at the end of test the microplastics on ags and hydrochar were observed as fluorescence images in fig 4b c obviously both ags and hydrochar surfaces were covered by lots of microplastics with red fluorescence but the amount of microplastics adsorbed and accumulated on hydrochar seemed more than that on ags ftir spectra in the wavenumber range of 500 4000 cm 1 of hydrochar before and after microplastic exposure in fig 4d further disclosed the adsorption of microplastics on hydrochar it can be seen that hydrochar processed abundant functional groups two distinct and sharp peaks at 3322 cm 1 and 2902 cm 1 are classified as o h and c h groups respectively qiu et al 2014 ma et al 2014 the bands at 1679 cm 1 and 1590 cm 1 stem from the stretching vibrations of co and n h or c n groups respectively deng and ting 2005 the peak at 1091 cm 1 is closely related to the deformation or vibration of c o c or c o groups chakravarty et al 2010 yang et al 2015 the peak shifts at these active functional groups were apparent regarding the ftir spectra of hydrochar exposed to microplastics revealing that the microplastics was adsorbed on hydrochar through the interaction with these functional groups 3 4 hydrochar stimulated eps secretion of microplastics bearing ags the eps excreted by microorganisms as an important component of ags are high molecular weight organic compounds eps normally adhered on the cell surface thereby building a barrier for protecting ags from the stress of adverse environment luongo and zhang 2010 sheng et al 2010 eps of ags from control ags and microplastics bearing ags with and without hydrochar amendment were extracted and characterized by eem fluorescence spectra the main fluorescence regions of eps in each case were presented in fig 5 a as mentioned above region i ex em 250 450 280 380 nm represents soluble microbial byproduct like substances region ii ex em 250 450 380 600 nm is on behalf of nonbiodegradable humic acid like substances these two components of eps located at each fluorescence region were quantified using fir analysis expressed as the normalized integration volume φ i as depicted in fig 5b the φ i values in both region i and region ii were strongly influenced under the shock of microplastics showing a reduction to the different extent compared to those of control ags several previous studies also found the quenching on fluorescence intensity of eps induced by the presence of metal ions and nanoparticles xu et al 2016 in contrast hydrochar with and without microplastic exposure enhanced the φ i values in both region i and region ii but the φ i values in these two regions in the case of hydrochar with microplastics exposure were highest these finds indicated that microplastic exposure restrained eps production of ags strikingly hydrochar itself can enhance ags to secrete eps and hydrochar and microplastics could synergistically further enhance eps production reinforcing the protection to ags it is reported liu et al 2020 that humic acid located at region ii could decrease microplastics affinity for cells by forming a corona on microplastics surface thereby effectively alleviating the adverse effect of microplastics thus hydrochar amendment largely increased humic acid generation of microplastics bearing ags probably weakening microplastics toxicity 3 5 hydrochar reduced the ros stress induced by microplastics pollutants with small particle size e g metal oxide nanoparticles microplastics and nanoplastics have been found to enable to adsorb on the cell surface and upregulating the intracellular ros even at the anaerobic environment mu and chen 2011 wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a it is elucidated that excessive intracellular ros enables to destroy cell membrane and trigger redox sensitive signaling pathways xia et al 2008 resulting in cytotoxicity and even the damages of cell viability xiao et al 2003 lab scale toxicology tests have demonstrated that excessive intracellular ros induced by micro nano plastics caused cytotoxicity towards algae anaerobe and invertebrate bhattacharya et al 2010 wei et al 2019 jeong et al 2016 in this study a 16 9 increase in the intracellular ros level was presented in fig 6 a when ags exposed to coexisting microplastics in contrast hydrochar itself had no effect on ros level in ags but its addition effectively mitigated the enhancement of intracellular ros level in ags induced by microplastics by 50 3 the concentration of ldh released out of the cell is commonly served as indicator of the integrity of cell membrane aligning with the change in intracellular ros level the results of extracellular ldh measurement revealed that microplastic exposure caused an increase in the amount of extracellular ldh however hydrochar amendment reduced the concentration of extracellular ldh in the microplastics bearing ags by 20 1 compared to that in the microplastics bearing ags without hydrochar addition the variations in both intracellular ros level and extracellular ldh concentration suggested that hydrochar was capable of serving as a remedial agent to alleviate the stress induced by ros to ags when exposed to multiple microplastics 3 6 hydrochar alleviated the microplastics suppressions on acidification and methanation of ags during wastewater treatment transformation of organic matter to methane by ags goes through two important biological processes they are acidification and methanation as such the efficiencies of these two individual steps determine the ultimate performance of wastewater treatment the impacts of hydrochar on acidification and methanation efficiencies of microplastics bearing ags were illustrated in fig 6b c for acidification step the presence of microplastics caused negative impact on its efficiencies compared to the control ags fig 6b representing a decrease of 16 9 however hydrochar itself enabled to improve acidification efficiency of ags when ags exposed to microplastics hydrochar addition mitigated the inhibition of microplastics to acidification step achieving the similar performance of ags in the control group without microplastic and hydrochar as seen in fig 6c an inhibitory effect on methanation step was also observed when ags exposed to microplastics the inhibition of microplastics on methanation 54 8 0 1 was significantly p 1 29e 10 stronger than acidification 16 9 0 1 indicating that methanogens were more susceptible to the toxicity of microplastics although hydrochar itself had insignificant p 0 4852 effect on methanation efficiency of ags when ags exposed to microplastics hydrochar addition could reduce the inhibition degree of microplastics to methanation efficiency showing 89 5 of ags methanation efficiency without microplastic exposure thus the positive effects of hydrochar on acidification and methanation steps of microplastics bearing ags likely contributed to great alleviation of overall performance of ags exposed to microplastics 4 discussion to date microplastics are widely spread in numerous water environments including surface water eriksen et al 2013 ground water ren et al 2021 oceans lusher et al 2014 rain abbasi 2021 and even sea ice kelly et al 2020 monitoring efforts have revealed that the abundant microplastics coexist in wastewater sun et al 2019 thus which is regarded to be a significant transmitter of microplastics from urban system into the aquatic environment carr et al 2016 this study emphasized the inhibition of co existing microplastics pet ps pe and pp in the wastewater on ags system for wastewater treatment for the first time to overcome the toxicity of microplastics to ags this study proposed an effective strategy based on hydrochar amendment the mitigation mechanisms could be explained by the following factors or any combination of these factors 1 the porous structure with abundant functional groups made hydrochar adsorb lots of microplastics on its surface reducing the direct contact between microplastics and ags 2 hydrochar enhanced ags to secrete eps reinforcing the protection to ags against microplastic disruption especially more humic acid in eps decreased microplastics affinity for cells weakening the toxicity of microplastics 3 intracellular oxidative stress in the microplastics bearing ags was mitigated by hydrochar amendment and 4 hydrochar amendment completely eliminated the inhibition of microplastics on acidification efficiency of ags and partially improved methanation efficiency of microplastics bearing ags carbon based materials have been successfully involved in mitigating the toxic impacts of environmental pollutants to plants via adsorption function for example biochar could bond cd and pb with its mineral phases to reduce cd level in rice tissues and pb content in root tissue which made a significant contribution to mitigate heavy metal pollution from rice agriculture bian et al 2014 abbas et al 2019 also found that biochar amendment effectively reduced the phyto toxic effect of agnps on rice growth by decreasing ag bioaccumulation in rice root and shoot tissues previous publications found that carbon based materials derived from different biomass sources had different capacity in adsorbing pollutants from aqueous systems nzediegwu et al 2021 taskin et al 2019 hence hydrochar produced from different feedstocks may possess different properties for microplastics adsorption additionally the production details of pyrolysis temperature and time are important determinants of micropores and surface functional groups sun et al 2014 since different types of microplastics coexist in the wastewater have diverse functional groups it is favorable to develop a sorbent that can capture all types of microplastics simultaneously as such optimization efforts would be needed to obtain a most efficient hydrochar to ensure the strongest adsorption capacity for various microplastics existence in the wastewater to reduce their accumulation on the ags surface note that there is no positive correlation between the hydrochar dosage and the pollutant removal percentage from the perspective of adsorption effect wu et al 2021 accordingly it would be essential to excavate the proper dosage of hydrochar in the system forming an economical way to mitigate microplastics toxicity notably material recycle is a necessary step for maintaining the reusability of hydrochar and reducing the subsequent risk of the adsorbed microplastics to the environment till now numerous efforts have been done to select the optimal regeneration method for carbon based materials which might be determined by the type of pollutant the stability of the material and the economic and energy costs the extensively applied techniques include filtration da na and awad 2017 solvent recycle jiang et al 2018 and thermal recycling hwang et al 2020 the mechanistic investigations regarding microplastics adsorption have attributed the relationship between carbon based materials and microplastics to hydrogen bond interactions π π interactions and electrostatic interactions wang et al 2021 thus the recovery of carbon based materials can be easily accomplished by being rinsed with solvent or being heated for microplastics desorption specially experimental results indicated that the carbon based materials that have been washed with ethanol to remove microplastics still maintained stable adsorption capability of microplastics compared to the freshly prepared materials sun et al 2020 similar to thermal treatment wang et al 2021 as such hydrochar particles adhered by microplastics would be recycled by being rinsed with solvent or being heated for microplastics desorption overall the hydrochar amendment is an economical and environmental friendly strategy in effectively mitigating the toxicity of microplastics to ags wastewater treatment systems 5 conclusion this study provided a first insight into the inhibitory effects of co existing multiple microplastics pet ps pe and pp in the wastewater on ags wastewater treatment system microplastics bearing ags showed decreased granule size increased cell inactivation and deteriorative methane recovery ability from wastewater hydrochar amendment effectively mitigated the reductions in menthane production granule size and cell viability of microplastics bearing ags and reduced the toxicity of microplastics to microbial community in the ags lots of microplastics adsorbed and accumulated on hydrochar surface due to its porous structure with abundance functional groups hydrochar enhanced the microplastics bearing ags to secrete eps with more humic acid generation intracellular ros level and extracellular ldh concentration in the microplastics bearing ags were also reduced by hydrochar amendment in addition hydrochar amendment completely eliminated the inhibition of multiple microplastics on acidification efficiency of ags whereas partially improved methanation efficiency of microplastics bearing ags declaration of
