11835,the current research was performed to evaluate the water quality index wqi from the south sikkim district india in the eastern himalayan region due to the rapid development of the tourism industry in the region water scarcity has become one of the significant issues in some parts of the south sikkim district the lack of sufficient spring water to meet their drinking water needs has forced the local people to depend on alternate sources such as surface or rainwater the main aim of the current research is to determine the acceptability of drinking water sources using the water quality index wqi values the bureau of indian standard bis 2012 was used to evaluate the wqi and evaluate the quality of water for the water sources physicochemical parameters such as potential of hydrogen ph hardness alkalinity iron fe fluoride f chloride cl nitrate no3 and turbidity were analysed using standard devices and found that water is safe for drinking purpose the presence of all these parameters did not affect the water quality as all are below the permissible limit the water delivered after conventional treatment to individual households by local administration is free from contaminants and suitable for drinking based on wqi values surface waterfalls under the projected area of south sikkim district into two categories excellent water and good water ranging from 0 to 50

water quality in sikkim varies from excellent to highly poor depending upon the seasons though presence of microbial activity in water is a matter of concern but ph of water found within permissible limit very few cases ph was observed slightly more than 8 5 however there is a paucity of studies that evaluate the water quality through the water quality index in the indian himalayan region of south sikkim sharma et al 2020 adimalla and qian 2019 assessed the water quality and associated human risk in the agricultural region of nanganur from south india they found that 61 percent of water samples contain nitrate exceeding the world health organisation who limit they estimate wqi due to excess nitrate and found it in the range of 92 295 with an average of 153 the health risks of children and infants due to excessive intake of groundwater contaminated with nitrates are 1 15 times and 1 75 times that of adults adimalla and qian 2019 adimalla et al 2018 studied the acceptability of groundwater for drinking purposes and for irrigation in the chinnakodur region from southern india and found that around 60 percent and 36 percent of groundwater samples could be categorised under

assessed by wqi and gis and it was discovered that approximately 76 percent of the area fell under the excellent very good and good category for drinking purposes while the remaining 24 percent fell below the poor category according to the wqi classification khan and jhariya 2017 the prediction accuracy of the results obtained is about 97 05 percent reflecting the capabilities of the technology used khan and jhariya 2017 the current study area is semi urban and rural where local people rely on surface water for drinking and domestic purposes some of the recent literature addresses the spring issues in india and nepal while some research the other regions water quality parameters adhikari et al 2021 babaei semiromi et al 2011 brown et al 1972 chandra et al 2017 there is a considerable amount of research has been carried out on the water quality parameters in a majority of the northeast india rivers puinyabati et al 2013 kar 2014 dutta and kar 2014 but there is a paucity of literature on the south sikkim region concerning wqi the paper evaluates the feasibility of surface water for human consumption using physicochemical data from drinking water standards and calculated wqi values in the given context the paper s objectives relies on two aspects a to find out the wqi in the south sikkim district of eastern himalayas and b to assess water quality at the source and suggested various points to develop a sustainable water management system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the south sikkim district is one of the major commercial and transport centres of the indian state of sikkim the district is covered by infinite terraces of agricultural grounds and stepped slopes intercepted by spring patched forests waterfalls and majestic mountains it is bounded by the latitude 27 14 20 n and longitude 88 18 15 e with an area of about 750 km2 as per the 2011 census report the total population of the south sikkim district is 1 46 742 and lies at an altitude between 400 m and 2000 m cgwb 2019 there are various climatic conditions in this region and the average annual precipitation is recorded at 162 5 cm mainly three seasons are observed i e summer between the months of april and june rainy season between the months of july and september and winter season the longest spanning the months of october to march average maximum temperature observed 17 27 c and a minimum of 02 21 c district profile south sikkim district census handbook sikkim five major areas ravangla melli temi jorethang and namchi under the south sikkim district have been identified to collect and analyse water samples the location of the study area on perennial and seasonal springs is presented in fig 1 2 2 methodology for selecting and testing water samples a total of 250 samples were randomly taken in different parts of the ravangla melli temi jorethang and namchi area to analyse the wqi values the methodology of work is framed in detailed at fig 2 the water sources for testing were chosen based on two criteria 1 sources of water used for drinking purpose and 2 water sources that are functional and operational all over the year as proposed by previous studies jakariya et al 2007 thakur and gupta 2016 the water samples of springs were selected based on the random way based on the information provided by the government of sikkim a colour comparator uses the testing procedures of ph iron nitrate arsenic and fluoride the colour comparator consisted of two parts 1 colour chart and 2 comparator unit there are four different colour charts for the above four parameters the required colour chart can be inserted in the comparator unit and the colour comparator can be used to test that particular parameter the colour chart can be easily removed and replaced with other parameters colour chart to use the same comparator unit for matching the test colour of other parameters the quality of water is analysed by testing the water at the source levels seasonal variation in water quality was observed during the collection and testing of water measuring ph value is very important to identify acidity or alkalinity dutta et al 2021 the presence of solids in water increases the turbidity of a water sample the other parameters like hardness alkalinity chloride nitrate iron fluoride also affect water quality and the presence of more than desirable concentrations can cause harmful diseases such as keratosis melanosis fluorosis methemoglobinemia blue baby disease the ph tds value is measured using a portable ph tds meter the other parameters turbidity hardness alkalinity chloride nitrate iron and fluoride values are measured immediately after collecting the samples using a portable multi parameter field test kit arsenic were also tested through using the field test kit as used in the earlier studies jakariya et al 2007 thakur and gupta 2016 2019 2020 thakur et al 2021 later some samples were also tested at environmental engineering lab nit sikkim to validate the field test kit results the hardness alkalinity and chloride were measured by titration method and iron is measured by spectrophotometric method finally the wqi values were determined using the water quality parameters 3 water distribution in south sikkim district people of the south sikkim district depend exclusively on surface water sources the central ground water board had earlier initiated to identify the potential fracture zones and evaluate groundwater quantity extracted from a successful borehole cgwb 2019 however water is supplied by tapping spring water sources at higher altitudes and transmitting raw water through gravity from these sources to lower altitudes this water is finally distributed through a zonal distribution system to consumer points village communities on the hill slopes rely primarily on springs or almost perennial springs for their drinking water supply additionally the state government s public works department pwd has implemented schemes for water supply the urban part of the south sikkim district like namchi ravangla melli temi jorethang collects water from the bermeilly khola 40 km from the city selaylay rabi khola doi khola rothak charchorey respectively however alternative water sources are also available under the smart city project by the government of india the upgradation of the water supply project is currently under process cgwb 2019 raw water is collected in a storage tank and filtered using gravity feed pressure filters after screening then it is supplied to various villages institutions industrial areas located at the same level or lower heights by gravity these water sources in the area are situated at different elevations springwater movement is mainly regulated by structural arrangements such as joint fracture fissure cracks the altitude of the identified water sources varies from 1100 to 5400 m above mean sea level during the water sample collection the discharge of the source water was found from 30 lpm to 100 lpm phed uses 65 150 mm dia ductile iron di or galvanized iron gi pipes to bring water from the source for most towns the filtered water is supplied to various zonal towns built in rcc with a storage capacity of 50 000 l 100000 l depending on the town s population currently 15 65 mm diameter gi pipelines are used to distribute water for continuous supply to the consumer the water received at consumer point is primarily fresh ph varies from 6 5 to 8 significantly less amount of calcium and magnesium salt is present free from arsenic and organic impurities and safe from fluoride nitrate people usually prefer warm water for drinking purposes due to colder climate conditions which is also helpful for removing various contaminants however in very few cases the presence of low concentration iron is observed in addition to the systems executed by the public works department pwd or the public health engineering department phed govt of sikkim other local water supply arrangements have been set up by gram panchayats and other local agencies for this purpose perennial springs are generally tapped south sikkim is also blessed with the teesta river at melli downstream and a small stretch of rangit river at nhpc dam site jorethang and triveni spcb sikkim monitored the river water quality throughout the year they have successfully implemented the national water quality monitoring programme nwmp to systematically observe water quality to know the nature and magnitude of degradations to the quality of water in the water bodies fig 3 confirms that the river water is comparatively fresh as per bis guidelines the water can be used for agriculture washing clothes and utensils as well as for various other purposes however it can be used for drinking purposes only after necessary treatment 4 results and discussion 4 1 geology and hydrogeology of spring aquifers in south sikkim due to the mountain slopes most of the precipitation will cause surface runoff creating streams springs and kholas as one of the primary water supply sources spring water must be supplemented with rainwater harvesting technology the arrangement of the metamorphic zones and structural features indicate that the zones were folded as a northerly plunging antiform with a bulk compositional variation resulting in mineralogy changes that can be seen even at the scale of a thin section in some garnet zone rocks das gupta et al 2004 groundwater dependent ecosystems include springs wetlands rivers and lakes and are threatened by multiple land use activities and also persistent climate change klove et al 2011 in villages where spring water does not discharge quickly it is recommended to clean spring water channels and increase the size of collection wells and water tanks to increase production also undeveloped perennial spring water is used for sustainable water supply in various regions the spring water that appears in the southern zone is mainly gravity and is found at different altitudes spring water movement is mainly controlled by joints fractures cracks fractures and other structural adjustments and the impact of groundwater in the surface ecosystems is not well studied klove et al 2011 all the springs in the area are perennial local families generally make the arrangements themselves by paying a monthly fee to the village plumber the water sources are usually nearby public water springs or public water tanks the plumber is tasked with the responsibility of maintaining the pipes and checking the availability of water interestingly the villagers also expressed great satisfaction with the present system and did not want any government intervention there is clear evidence that springs have dried up and temporal and spatial changes in rainfall patterns however in the field research people did not express serious concerns about the water shortage in addition traditional knowledge and beliefs are also maintained to protect natural spring water springs are believed to flow from where the goddess lives such sites are called devithan tiwari 2012 most of the spring water is fresh and soft but iron has been observed in some cases near the namchi area in an interesting study on spring flows in micro watersheds in indian himalayas dass et al 2021 assessed water scarcity poverty anthropogenic and climatic factors and limited scope of alternative livelihoods the resilience at the community level in the himalayas protecting spring water at the community level through various methods can be mapping spring water through hydrogeology restoring protecting and increasing charging monitoring and managing springs and dissemination outreach and sharing of knowledge niti aayog 2018 in order to understand the hydrogeological process and evaluate the flow pattern and storage dynamics of the aquifer the water balance correlation flow duration master recession curves analysis and geological studies were applied to assess aquifer storage flow regimes and dynamics of aquifer storage dass et al 2021 women are important stakeholders with the community s involvement in building the capacity in introductory geology hydrology and water management a conscious effort is made to form women led water users groups and involve them in replenishment activities and decision making niti aayog 2018 there is a reduction in the temporal spread of rainfall and increased intensity of decline in winter rain due to climate change which causes the drying up of spring water sources and preservation of seeds during the warm winter is becoming risky and subtropical villages of drought prone zones are more vulnerable tambe et al 2011 4 2 water quality index wqi analysis while several indicators assess the drinking water security in a region debnath 2019 the water quality index wqi is easier to calculate in the present work eight essential parameters of water quality are selected to analyse the wqi while selecting the parameters for our assessment of the water quality we placed importance on those that were particularly problematic for drinking water and were also easy to measure through field test kits among the eight parameters ph hardness alkalinity iron fluoride and chloride measure the chemical aspects of water quality nitrate is a proxy for the biological contents in water and turbidity is an important measure of the physical characteristics of the tested water the average values of each parameter are indicated in table 1 along with the bureau of indian standard bis 2012 the wqi has been computed using the standard values of drinking water suggested by the bureau of indian standard these are then taken to evaluate the wqi of the water as detailed through the equations below the proportionality constant k value is calculated using the following equation chandra et al 2017 i k 1 i 1 n 1 s n where sn is standard permissible for nth parameter calculate unit weight for the nth parameter ii w n k s n where wn is the unit weight for the nth parameter and sn is the standard value for nth parameters the quality rating qn for nth parameter is calculated using the formula iii q n 100 v n v i o s n v i o qn is the quality rating for the nth parameter whereas vn is the estimated value of the nth parameter of the given sampling station vio is the ideal value of nth parameter in pure water and sn is the standard permissible value of the nth parameter finally the water quality index wqi is evaluated by using the following formula iv w q i w n q n w n the average values of ph hardness alkalinity iron fluoride chloride nitrate and turbidity are presented in table 1 the weighted arithmetic water quality index wawqi method classifies water quality depending on purity by utilising the commonly measured water quality parameters tyagi et al 2013 chandra et al 2017 the calculated wqi value is divided into five types from excellent water to water not suitable for drinking table 2 the proportionality constant k is determined based on the results received from the site by using equation i quality rating is measured by the estimated value of raw water and the superior value of pure water except for ph the ideal values for all parameters are assumed as zero as these parameters affect water quality the overall wqi values are determined by summation of all individual wqi values of each parameter the calculated wqi values of five areas are shown in fig 4 it can be observed from the graph that water is safe for drinking purposes for all five areas according to the water quality rating given in table 2 relatively jorethang and ravangla have better water quality than the other areas in the study after exploring the various indices of water quality the purpose of wqi is to give a specific value to the source s water quality and reduce the number of parameters to a simple expression which will result in an easy understanding of the water quality data analysis during the field visit some of the serious issues are identified in the water supply distribution system like seepage problem storage reservoirs use of old gravity main without air valves frequent damages of pipelines due to landslides and heavy rainfall water leakage laying of water pipes haphazardly with the drainage system unmetered water connections and lack of maintenance there is no existing strategy to promote the water conservation technology methodology re use and re cycle the used water rainwater harvesting using the emerging technologies like co polymer based cross wave technology after a detailed literature study field testing and meeting with various stakeholders the following proposals are being given to address water scarcity problems first awareness generation is essential and it should be launched from the grassroots level in addition professional courses may be planned to draw the interest of practitioners second the pre and post assessment of the socio economic survey water quality health survey and beneficiary s opinion reflect positively in achievements of anticipated benefits and impacts third water harvesting in hilly areas is a method of conserving water in order to promote technology the entire area may be divided into three parts depending on the availability of water a areas with perennial water sources b areas with seasonal water sources and c rainfed areas are entirely dependent on rainfall fourth the flows from perennial water springs largely go to waste however its collection and storage in suitably designed tanks ponds can make a tremendous water resource to solve drinking and household water needs and irrigation in the region fifth all over the bamboo drip irrigation system is best suited and cost effective and readily useable technic for poor farmers of the hilly region sixth jack well construction may be encouraged in the vicinity of the rivers seventh in locations where faecal contamination has occurred at the consumer end it is necessary to take the appropriate precautionary measures to avoid any adverse health effects last but not least the development of new technologies for water management with the help of ngos and government organizations and spread these technologies in needy persons 5 conclusion this study confirms that currently the supplied water to the community level in the district of south sikkim is of good quality and can be used for drinking cooking or other daily use purposes according to the wqi level melli jorethang and ravangla have an excellent quality of water remi and namchi area also has good quality of water the district faces a severe water shortage problem being the most populated district after east sikkim there is a need of significant improvement in the distribution of water supply through various channels such as awareness seepage problem and storage of conservation reservoirs unmetered connections and lack of proper maintenance technology promotion on water availability based on the needy areas could be an important issue to tackle the water scarcity there are some limitations of the study for example it could have been ideal to take different samples on season wise and then propose some locally feasible mitigation measure but due to the technical constraint it has not done and it can be a future insight despite the limitations the present study s findings will encourage policymakers and the public to realize the consequences of the receding supply of mountain water and look for possible solutions before any severe crisis occurs the findings also help to maintain sustainable water management practices in the hilly region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the research is undertaken under the project innovative and sustainable decision support system for drinking water security in indian himalayan region of sikkim and west bengal funded by the ministry of environment forest and climate change

between the months of april and june rainy season between the months of july and september and winter season the longest spanning the months of october to march average maximum temperature observed 17 27 c and a minimum of 02 21 c district profile south sikkim district census handbook sikkim five major areas ravangla melli temi jorethang and namchi under the south sikkim district have been identified to collect and analyse water samples the location of the study area on perennial and seasonal springs is presented in fig 1 2 2 methodology for selecting and testing water samples a total of 250 samples were randomly taken in different parts of the ravangla melli temi jorethang and namchi area to analyse the wqi values the methodology of work is framed in detailed at fig 2 the water sources for testing were chosen based on two criteria 1 sources of water used for drinking purpose and 2 water sources that are functional and operational all over the year as proposed by previous studies jakariya et al 2007 thakur and gupta 2016 the water samples of springs were selected based on the random way based on the information provided by the government of sikkim a colour comparator uses the testing procedures of ph iron nitrate arsenic and fluoride the colour comparator consisted of two parts 1 colour chart and 2 comparator unit there are four different colour charts for the above four parameters the required colour chart can be inserted in the comparator unit and the colour comparator can be used to test that particular parameter the colour chart can be easily removed and replaced with other parameters colour chart to use the same comparator unit for matching the test colour of other parameters the quality of water is analysed by testing the water at the source levels seasonal variation in water quality was observed during the collection and testing of water measuring ph value is very important to identify acidity or alkalinity dutta et al 2021 the presence of solids in water increases the turbidity of a water sample the other parameters like hardness alkalinity chloride nitrate iron fluoride also affect water quality and the presence of more than desirable concentrations can cause harmful diseases such as keratosis melanosis fluorosis methemoglobinemia blue baby disease the ph tds value is measured using a portable ph tds meter the other parameters turbidity hardness alkalinity chloride nitrate iron and fluoride values are measured immediately after collecting the samples using a portable multi parameter field test kit arsenic were also tested through using the field test kit as used in the earlier studies jakariya et al 2007 thakur and gupta 2016 2019 2020 thakur et al 2021 later some samples were also tested at environmental engineering lab nit sikkim to validate the field test kit results the hardness alkalinity and chloride were measured by titration method and iron is measured by spectrophotometric method finally the wqi values were determined using the water quality parameters 3 water distribution in south sikkim district people of the south sikkim district depend exclusively on surface water sources the central ground water board had earlier initiated to identify the potential fracture zones and evaluate groundwater quantity extracted from a successful borehole cgwb 2019 however water is supplied by tapping spring water sources at higher altitudes and transmitting raw water through gravity from these sources to lower altitudes this water is finally distributed through a zonal distribution system to consumer points village communities on the hill slopes rely primarily on springs or almost perennial springs for their drinking water supply additionally the state government s public works department pwd has implemented schemes for water supply the urban part of the south sikkim district like namchi ravangla melli temi jorethang collects water from the bermeilly khola 40 km from the city selaylay rabi khola doi khola rothak charchorey respectively however alternative water sources are also available under the smart city project by the government of india the upgradation of the water supply project is currently under process cgwb 2019 raw water is collected in a storage tank and filtered using gravity feed pressure filters after screening then it is supplied to various villages institutions industrial areas located at the same level or lower heights by gravity these water sources in the area are situated at different elevations springwater movement is mainly regulated by structural arrangements such as joint fracture fissure cracks the altitude of the identified water sources varies from 1100 to 5400 m above mean sea level during the water sample collection the discharge of the source water was found from 30 lpm to 100 lpm phed uses 65 150 mm dia ductile iron di or galvanized iron gi pipes to bring water from the source for most towns the filtered water is supplied to various zonal towns built in rcc with a storage capacity of 50 000 l 100000 l depending on the town s population currently 15 65 mm diameter gi pipelines are used to distribute water for continuous supply to the consumer the water received at consumer point is primarily fresh ph varies from 6 5 to 8 significantly less amount of calcium and magnesium salt is present free from arsenic and organic impurities and safe from fluoride nitrate people usually prefer warm water for drinking purposes due to colder climate conditions which is also helpful for removing various contaminants however in very few cases the presence of low concentration iron is observed in addition to the systems executed by the public works department pwd or the public health engineering department phed govt of sikkim other local water supply arrangements have been set up by gram panchayats and other local agencies for this purpose perennial springs are generally tapped south sikkim is also blessed with the teesta river at melli downstream and a small stretch of rangit river at nhpc dam site jorethang and triveni spcb sikkim monitored the river water quality throughout the year they have successfully implemented the national water quality monitoring programme nwmp to systematically observe water quality to know the nature and magnitude of degradations to the quality of water in the water bodies fig 3 confirms that the river water is comparatively fresh as per bis guidelines the water can be used for agriculture washing clothes and utensils as well as for various other purposes however it can be used for drinking purposes only after necessary treatment 4 results and discussion 4 1 geology and hydrogeology of spring aquifers in south sikkim due to the mountain slopes most of the precipitation will cause surface runoff creating streams springs and kholas as one of the primary water supply sources spring water must be supplemented with rainwater harvesting technology the arrangement of the metamorphic zones and structural features indicate that the zones were folded as a northerly plunging antiform with a bulk compositional variation resulting in mineralogy changes that can be seen even at the scale of a thin section in some garnet zone rocks das gupta et al 2004 groundwater dependent ecosystems include springs wetlands rivers and lakes and are threatened by multiple land use activities and also persistent climate change klove et al 2011 in villages where spring water does not discharge quickly it is recommended to clean spring water channels and increase the size of collection wells and water tanks to increase production also undeveloped perennial spring water is used for sustainable water supply in various regions the spring water that appears in the southern zone is mainly gravity and is found at different altitudes spring water movement is mainly controlled by joints fractures cracks fractures and other structural adjustments and the impact of groundwater in the surface ecosystems is not well studied klove et al 2011 all the springs in the area are perennial local families generally make the arrangements themselves by paying a monthly fee to the village plumber the water sources are usually nearby public water springs or public water tanks the plumber is tasked with the responsibility of maintaining the pipes and checking the availability of water interestingly the villagers also expressed great satisfaction with the present system and did not want any government intervention there is clear evidence that springs have dried up and temporal and spatial changes in rainfall patterns however in the field research people did not express serious concerns about the water shortage in addition traditional knowledge and beliefs are also maintained to protect natural spring water springs are believed to flow from where the goddess lives such sites are called devithan tiwari 2012 most of the spring water is fresh and soft but iron has been observed in some cases near the namchi area in an interesting study on spring flows in micro watersheds in indian himalayas dass et al 2021 assessed water scarcity poverty anthropogenic and climatic factors and limited scope of alternative livelihoods the resilience at the community level in the himalayas protecting spring water at the community level through various methods can be mapping spring water through hydrogeology restoring protecting and increasing charging monitoring and managing springs and dissemination outreach and sharing of knowledge niti aayog 2018 in order to understand the hydrogeological process and evaluate the flow pattern and storage dynamics of the aquifer the water balance correlation flow duration master recession curves analysis and geological studies were applied to assess aquifer storage flow regimes and dynamics of aquifer storage dass et al 2021 women are important stakeholders with the community s involvement in building the capacity in introductory geology hydrology and water management a conscious effort is made to form women led water users groups and involve them in replenishment activities and decision making niti aayog 2018 there is a reduction in the temporal spread of rainfall and increased intensity of decline in winter rain due to climate change which causes the drying up of spring water sources and preservation of seeds during the warm winter is becoming risky and subtropical villages of drought prone zones are more vulnerable tambe et al 2011 4 2 water quality index wqi analysis while several indicators assess the drinking water security in a region debnath 2019 the water quality index wqi is easier to calculate in the present work eight essential parameters of water quality are selected to analyse the wqi while selecting the parameters for our assessment of the water quality we placed importance on those that were particularly problematic for drinking water and were also easy to measure through field test kits among the eight parameters ph hardness alkalinity iron fluoride and chloride measure the chemical aspects of water quality nitrate is a proxy for the biological contents in water and turbidity is an important measure of the physical characteristics of the tested water the average values of each parameter are indicated in table 1 along with the bureau of indian standard bis 2012 the wqi has been computed using the standard values of drinking water suggested by the bureau of indian standard these are then taken to evaluate the wqi of the water as detailed through the equations below the proportionality constant k value is calculated using the following equation chandra et al 2017 i k 1 i 1 n 1 s n where sn is standard permissible for nth parameter calculate unit weight for the nth parameter ii w n k s n where wn is the unit weight for the nth parameter and sn is the standard value for nth parameters the quality rating qn for nth parameter is calculated using the formula iii q n 100 v n v i o s n v i o qn is the quality rating for the nth parameter whereas vn is the estimated value of the nth parameter of the given sampling station vio is the ideal value of nth parameter in pure water and sn is the standard permissible value of the nth parameter finally the water quality index wqi is evaluated by using the following formula iv w q i w n q n w n the average values of ph hardness alkalinity iron fluoride chloride nitrate and turbidity are presented in table 1 the weighted arithmetic water quality index wawqi method classifies water quality depending on purity by utilising the commonly measured water quality parameters tyagi et al 2013 chandra et al 2017 the calculated wqi value is divided into five types from excellent water to water not suitable for drinking table 2 the proportionality constant k is determined based on the results received from the site by using equation i quality rating is measured by the estimated value of raw water and the superior value of pure water except for ph the ideal values for all parameters are assumed as zero as these parameters affect water quality the overall wqi values are determined by summation of all individual wqi values of each parameter the calculated wqi values of five areas are shown in fig 4 it can be observed from the graph that water is safe for drinking purposes for all five areas according to the water quality rating given in table 2 relatively jorethang and ravangla have better water quality than the other areas in the study after exploring the various indices of water quality the purpose of wqi is to give a specific value to the source s water quality and reduce the number of parameters to a simple expression which will result in an easy understanding of the water quality data analysis during the field visit some of the serious issues are identified in the water supply distribution system like seepage problem storage reservoirs use of old gravity main without air valves frequent damages of pipelines due to landslides and heavy rainfall water leakage laying of water pipes haphazardly with the drainage system unmetered water connections and lack of maintenance there is no existing strategy to promote the water conservation technology methodology re use and re cycle the used water rainwater harvesting using the emerging technologies like co polymer based cross wave technology after a detailed literature study field testing and meeting with various stakeholders the following proposals are being given to address water scarcity problems first awareness generation is essential and it should be launched from the grassroots level in addition professional courses may be planned to draw the interest of practitioners second the pre and post assessment of the socio economic survey water quality health survey and beneficiary s opinion reflect positively in achievements of anticipated benefits and impacts third water harvesting in hilly areas is a method of conserving water in order to promote technology the entire area may be divided into three parts depending on the availability of water a areas with perennial water sources b areas with seasonal water sources and c rainfed areas are entirely dependent on rainfall fourth the flows from perennial water springs largely go to waste however its collection and storage in suitably designed tanks ponds can make a tremendous water resource to solve drinking and household water needs and irrigation in the region fifth all over the bamboo drip irrigation system is best suited and cost effective and readily useable technic for poor farmers of the hilly region sixth jack well construction may be encouraged in the vicinity of the rivers seventh in locations where faecal contamination has occurred at the consumer end it is necessary to take the appropriate precautionary measures to avoid any adverse health effects last but not least the development of new technologies for water management with the help of ngos and government organizations and spread these technologies in needy persons 5 conclusion this study confirms that currently the supplied water to the community level in the district of south sikkim is of good quality and can be used for drinking cooking or other daily use purposes according to the wqi level melli jorethang and ravangla have an excellent quality of water remi and namchi area also has good quality of water the district faces a severe water shortage problem being the most populated district after east sikkim there is a need of significant improvement in the distribution of water supply through various channels such as awareness seepage problem and storage of conservation reservoirs unmetered connections and lack of proper maintenance technology promotion on water availability based on the needy areas could be an important issue to tackle the water scarcity there are some limitations of the study for example it could have been ideal to take different samples on season wise and then propose some locally feasible mitigation measure but due to the technical constraint it has not done and it can be a future insight despite the limitations the present study s findings will encourage policymakers and the public to realize the consequences of the receding supply of mountain water and look for possible solutions before any severe crisis occurs the findings also help to maintain sustainable water management practices in the hilly region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the research is undertaken under the project

tool swat hydrological model was studied three general circulation models gcms under two representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 were used to project future rainfall and temperature present climate and land use were used to develop the swat model future land use was generated by using land use change predictor model ca markov from present maps groundwater recharge fluctuated with changing climate and land use with an increase of annual temperature by 2 1 c and 3 7 c for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively by 2050 the annual mean precipitation increased by 2 45 and 4 47 for both scenarios resulting in an 8 rise in recharge along with a seasonal shift future land use change reduced recharge up to 38 the combined impacts of climate and land use change reduced groundwater recharge by 15 graphical abstract image 1 keywords climate change groundwater recharge land use change lower ravi river basin swat 1 introduction climate change is one of the biggest challenges for mankind in the 21st century freshwater availability will be limited due to ice melting temperature changes and sea level rise global average annual temperatures have risen to 0 87 c which has caused sea levels to rise to 52 98 cm ipcc 2019 increasing trends in the population are encouraging urbanization which is currently the main cause of land use change pakistan has the highest urbanization rate among others in south asia and as per the census conducted in 2017 about 36 4 of the country s population was living in the urban areas whereas this figure was 32 5 in the census of 1998 undp 2018 in the context of lahore the second most populous city of pakistan more than 90 of the population lives in city district area and owing to factors like rapid urbanization the establishment of new industrial zones and residential towns etc more and more people relocate rana and bhatti 2018 humanity is striving to make life easier which puts stress on natural resources supply dipping into those which are needed to fulfil the requirements of the future the influence of climate change and changing land use patterns have serious consequences on the water resources of different systems for different regions liaqat et al 2021 yang et al 2019 it is imperative to consider future climate change and land use change patterns before any water resource schemes are planned afzal and ragab 2019 pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries susceptible to the consequences of climate change and may face extreme weather events like droughts and floods ipcc 2019 pakistan has faced several floods in recent years in 2010 record breaking rains hit the northern province khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab causing massive flooding in almost all areas of pakistan about 2000 people died leaving 20 million people affected by the disaster shah et al 2018 river ravi is one of the major rivers flowing through lahore the river remained a great source of domestic water supplies and agriculture for years basharat and rizvi 2011 after the partition of the sub continent into india and pakistan in 1960 a treaty was signed between two countries giving the rights of eastern rivers to india river ravi was one of these and is now facing the problem of drying up in low flow spells occurring from october until may no significant discharge is released to the river from the indian border these low flow conditions have many consequences including but not restricted to environmental mahmood et al 2011 and groundwater replenishment processes malana and khosa 2011 generally runoffs are generated from rainfall in the upper mountainous reaches of the ravi river basin and run through plain areas to join the indus river which is the largest river system in pakistan the runoff from the upper reaches significantly impacts the irrigation and household water systems downstream the forest area is reduced due to larger lumber demands while continuous urbanization adds pressure to the groundwater recharge reduced inflows to water reservoirs also put stress on groundwater recharge making its extraction alarming as compared to annual recharge basharat and rizvi 2011 the groundwater level in lrrb especially in the densely populated city of lahore is extraordinarily depleting owing to rapid abstraction as compared to the recharge according to water and sanitation agency lahore lwasa the annual depletion rate has been estimated to be about 0 57 1 35 m due to unregulated abstraction and no recharging efforts the maximum water table depth in 2011 was 45 m with an annual groundwater withdrawal of about 1161 mcm million cubic meters currently the recharge to groundwater is estimated at 1013 mcm including inflows from boundaries in comparison to the abstracted amount of 1161 mcm on annual basis which provided a difference of 15 between abstraction and recharge river ravi was the major source of groundwater recharge to the aquifer till 2000 but its flow has come to an almost dead level due to dams constructed upstream in the indian territory such regulatory flows have significantly reduced recharge in the river which is a serious issue concerning the water demands in the future with drastic depletion rate in groundwater level basharat 2020 in the case of shortages of surface water supplies groundwater becomes the only lifeline for survival in many parts of the world cook et al 2018 rapid population growth urbanization inconsiderate water distribution and consumption practices in pakistan have an adverse effect on the quantity as well as the quality of groundwater resources in addition the region is unsustainable in terms of freshwater resources and is already prone to severe water stress ali 2021 the recharge is contributed through river water which is mainly contributed by heavy precipitations in the monsoon season this shallow aquifer is also replenished by the seepage from lakes rivers and irrigation canals which may take groundwater polluting agents along ahmad et al 2001 gabriel and khan 2010 considered climate change combined with urban water management for a sustainable aquifer groundwater flow model modflow was developed for the study area the results showed an unsustainable aquifer consequently they proposed different management options for the stressed aquifer of lahore city in pakistan it was concluded that the aquifer is highly pressurized with low recharge and extraordinary abstractions basharat and rizvi 2011 studied the contours and groundwater levels from the depth of water table in lahore city in 2009 to visualize the present groundwater flow directions the map showed a depression of about 36 m deep within a radius of about 25 km under lahore city this is caused by concentrated pumping and the least recharge to the aquifer muhammad et al 2015 studied groundwater vulnerability assessment in lahore city using the drastic model according to his findings areas under high risk moderate risk and no risks were 28 8 46 3 and 10 4 respectively mahmood et al 2011 conducted quantitative measurements of groundwater depressions using geographical information system gis there was a depression zone in groundwater level below 38 m and its expansion at an average rate of 24 5 km squared per year was identified apart from climate change land use changes significantly affect the hydrological cycle of a basin the rapid urbanization in lahore city was studied by bhalli and ghaffar 2015 the land use generated maps revealed that the areal expansion is mainly attributed to the loss of agricultural land and its conversion to urban areas an increase of about 40 81 was seen in the urban areas with a significant reduction in the agricultural land area of about 12 98 from 2000 to 2014 fahad et al 2021 reported the impacts of land use changes on the water cycle specifically concentrating upon the mean annual runoff of the region hydrological models are vital tools to study the effects of land use change on the hydrological cycle karvonen et al 1999 groundwater systems can be better understood using computer based numerical models as hydrological models are best predictive for handling groundwater in aquifers yao et al 2015 one example of a hydrological model is the soil and water assessment tool swat it has been used extensively worldwide for hydrological modeling it acts as a multi functional model with optimization of fewer parameters as compared to many in other hydrological models the swat model predominantly analyses the relationship between precipitation and consequently generated runoff rostamian et al 2008 impacts of climate change on hydrological cycle x zhang srinivasan and hao 2007 impacts of land use change on the water cycle of a basin l zhang et al 2020 and sediment load kuti and ewemoje 2021 the swat model can also be coupled with other hydrological models to simulate the impacts of land use patterns of landscape functions senent aparicio et al 2020 the core of this hydrological study is to assess the influence of future climate change and land use change on the water balance of the lrrb which is yet to be explored climate change is responsible for alterations in amount and the allocation of precipitation and regional temperature thereby having direct impacts on catchment runoff the hydrological system of the basin is analyzed based on historical meteorological data and a hydrological model named swat is utilized for hydrological simulations and impacts of climate change land use change and a combination of both on groundwater recharge in the basin considering climate change and land use change scenarios this study is an essential contribution towards the hydrological response of ravi river to craft management strategies for sustainable consumption of groundwater resources in the region and preservation of the ecosystem the results of this research have shown that the future climate in the area is going to alter the set of gcms used to project the future climate revealed that the rise in future annual temperature in the study area under rcp4 5 was expected to be 2 1 c whereas for rcp 8 5 it was 3 7 c the future annual precipitation is expected to increase by 2 45 and 4 47 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively the rise in precipitation resulted in an 8 rise in recharge along with a seasonal shift the future land use change reduced recharge up to 38 the combined impacts of climate and land use change reduced groundwater recharge by 15 2 materials and method 2 1 study area ravi river originates from the himalayas in the multhan tehsil of kangra district himachal pradesh india it is a perennial river of the province punjab which was divided into pakistan and india after their independence in 1947 as reported by the water commission of india commission 2019 the annual flow in india is about 11 52 million acre feet maf most of this water is stored in madhopur headworks in india and approximately 4 54 maf is released downstream across the country boundary in pakistan punjab irrigation department 2016 at the entrance in pakistan there is a gauging station at jassar the river course from jassar till the joining into the chenab river is considered as lrrb with a catchment area of 680 km2 the upper reach of the basin has ample urban cover while the remaining part is densely irrigated land and patchy forest area the location map of lrrb in north east pakistan is shown in fig 1 the basic inputs to the swat model are the digital elevation model dem land use soil and slope maps the upper reach of the basin has higher altitudes as compared to the lower with flat slopes the soil of the basin is broadly classified as sandy loam the major land use classes are crops grasslands urban and water fig 2 represents the spatial inputs for lrrb pakistan the principal data used in model simulation includes daily precipitation temperature humidity wind speed solar radiation and discharge data for the baseline period 1991 2005 the meteorological data was obtained from the pakistan meteorological department lahore office through personal communication while the discharge data for balloki barrage station was obtained from punjab irrigation department refer to fig 1 the dem was obtained from the united states department of geological survey for the hydrological model a soil map for the model was downloaded from food and agriculture organization fao punjab land use department statistics were used to generate supervised classification land use maps of the study area for the years 2000 2007 and 2012 the general methodology is shown in fig 3 2 2 downscaling and bias correction of gcm data generally gcms have a coarse resolution and are unable to represent the fine scale processes franklin et al 2013 this resolution is not enough to analyze the impacts precisely therefore the gcm data before use requires downscaling for a specific area it is recommended to have several climate observation station points for areas with a sudden change in topography or heterogeneous land use types wilby et al 2004 gcms are frequently used for future projections of climate and yet possess certain uncertainty based on their initial conditions and implementation processes asseng et al 2013 several gcms are recommended for reliable estimation of climate parameters in the future mendes et al 2017 qmap technique of statistical downscaling and bias correction of raw data of all the three gcms namely community climate system model ccsm4 max planck institute earth system model mpi and model for interdisciplinary research on climate miroc5 was utilized in this study as they have shown satisfactory results in the region aslam et al 2020 bias correction of gcm data is equally important for water resources especially impacts studies in which coarse resolution gcm data is translated into high temporal and spatial resolution data maraun et al 2010 it can be done by several methods one of the statistical downscaling and bias correction methods is quantile mapping qmap in this technique the quantiles for observed and gcm data are compared by interpolation through a transfer function between the corresponding quantiles linear approximation of the qmap function is used for the consequential modifications this corresponds to a linear mapping function defined through the points of grids aslam et al 2020 different climate change scenarios were developed as they better represent the uncertain future mäkelä et al 2020 above mentioned gcms were coupled with the hydrological model to generate future scenarios under two rcps namely 4 5 and 8 5 2 3 ca markov land use model cellular automata and the markov ca markov is used to simulate the future quantitative as well as spatial characteristics of land use in lrrb for years 2030 and 2050 based on the land use data sets of 2000 2007 and 2012 markov is a process defined as the state of a system that can be predicted at a time state by taking a certain time as the basis by generating a matrix of transition probabilities from one cover class to the other hyandye and martz 2017 different combinations and multiple category land use changes can be simulated by using the ca markov module the basics of this projection include the generation of a transition probability matrix ca markov module utilizes this matrix for analysis of future land use conditions memarian et al 2012 a transition area matrix expresses the total area expected to be changed in the next time step the conditional probability expresses the belonging of a pixel to a certain category of the class in a land use map the outputs of the process are referred to as conditional probability maps as the probability is conditional to their current state subedi et al 2013 ca markov performs a chain analysis in integrated geographic information system software this helps in the generation of a transition matrix between past land use maps and estimates the probabilities of change in future projections of land use the spatial visualization of land use map is also possible using this model 2 4 hydrological model swat the hydrological model used in the simulation of groundwater recharge is swat it is a semi distributed process based hydrological model with the capability to operate and simulate under different climate and land use scenarios it can generate long term hydrological changes using the inputs based on daily as well as monthly time steps consequently the model is preferred in impact assessment studies involving climate change land use change and policy management etc bhatta et al 2019 eq 1 shows the basic water balance equation governed by the model as expressed by nasiri et al 2020 1 s w t sw o i 1 t r d a y q s u r f a c e e a w s e e p q g w where swt mm represents the final soil water content sw0 mm represents the initial soil water content time in days is shown as t rday mm is the amount of precipitation on an ith day qsurface mm is the amount of surface runoff on that particular day ea mm is the amount of evapotranspiration wseep mm is the amount of water that enters the vadose zone from the soil profile and qgw represents the amount of water contributing to the groundwater recharge in mm swat model uses two methods to calculate the runoff of a certain watershed first is the runoff curve number method which is developed by the soil conservation service scs united states department of agriculture and the second is the green ampt infiltration method green w h ampt 1911 the runoff curve method is used in this study as proven to be better than the green ampt infiltration method senent aparicio et al 2020 the potential evapotranspiration is calculated by the conventional penman monteith equation the soil evaporation is dependent upon soil depth soil moisture and potential evapotranspiration while vegetation transpiration is a function of the growth status of vegetation evapotranspiration leaf area index and soil root depth the kinematic storage model presented by sloan and moore 1984 calculates the inflow through the soil the model considers the hydrological conductance of soil its slope and the spatial and temporal changes of the soil moisture the model calculates the base flow using eq 2 as follows 2 q gw i q gw i 1 exp α gw δt w rchrg 1 exp α gw δt where the term qgw i mm represents the groundwater flow into the river on a given day i similarly qgw i 1 is the flow on the day i 1 αgw is the constant for base flow recession in time δt which is time step 1 day and wrchrg mm is the amount of water contributing to the groundwater recharge 2 5 swat model setup the first step in the model setup was watershed delineation the number of sub basins and stream networks was decided based on a threshold input area this area signifies the drainage pattern required to start the stream processing the model performance and number of sub basins have an inverse relationship if the number of sub basins is increased the performance of the model can be compromised romanowicz et al 2005 the outlet of the whole basin was taken just downstream of balloki barrage swat divided the whole basin into 45 sub basins hydraulic response units hru are the smallest units representing an area with unique land use and soil features the model calculates the runoff for each hru and takes the sum of each to estimate the total runoff from the basin the basic entities for hru generation include land use maps soil maps and slopes the available land use data was used to carry out supervised classification and present land use maps were generated as the area was flat the slope was divided into two classes namely 0 5 and greater than 5 fao 1995 to avoid the formation of too many and smaller hrus a 10 threshold value was set for all land use soil and slope respectively to optimize the number of hrus the swat model usually recommends a value ranging between 5 and 20 larose et al 2007 this enhances the computational efficiency of the model the model generated 133 hrus and 45 sub basins in the basin the outputs were used to compare the observed data downstream of the balloki barrage for the calibration and validation of the swat model 2 6 groundwater recharge scenarios to comprehend the impacts of climate change and land use change on groundwater recharge this study was divided into four scenarios the first case is the baseline in which current climate and land use were incorporated in the hydrological model to get the baseline recharge in the watershed secondly with the baseline monthly average recharge future recharge for only climate change scenarios was found by the input of future climate in the calibrated model this was done for all three gcms individually the recharge to groundwater was studied for two rcp scenarios the input to the model was sub divided into two future periods namely 2030s 2021 2040 and 2050s 2041 2060 the third scenario was developed by keeping the baseline climate and incorporating the land use change in the model for this purpose the current land use was generated by supervised classification for the study area the generated maps were used as inputs to the land use change model the land use change model was used to generate future changes in the land use for the study area land use change maps for the years 2030 and 2050 were generated after the development of future land use maps the swat model was run with baseline climate and future land use map once for each of the above listed years the fourth scenario for assessing the impacts on groundwater recharge was developed by a combination of climate and land use changes the distribution of a specific future climate with a specific future land use was developed the future climate range was taken from the year 2021 2060 while land use maps were used for the years 2030 and 2050 the combinations were the mean average climate of 2021 2040 with a land use map of 2030 and mean average climate of 2041 2060 and land use of 2050 swat model was run for these combinations this process helped in the assessment of groundwater recharge under land use and climate change collectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 calibration and validation of swat model sensitivity analysis for the swat model parameters was carried out in this study as recommended by larbi et al 2020 the most sensitive model parameters associated with the groundwater along with their default values and the fitted values for calibration are enlisted in table 1 the deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp is the fraction of water percolating from the root zone and contributing to the deep aquifer recharge in contrast the groundwater revap coefficient gw revap is associated with the water that moves from the shallow aquifer to the partially saturated overlying zone it is identical to capillary action in which water diffuses into the upper unsaturated soil layers a part of this coefficient can also be the water taken up by the deep rooted plants that absorb water from the shallow aquifer miskewitz 2007 although the saturated zone of soil is not very shallow for lrrb but the root depth is significant and the majority of land cover is agricultural type hence the calibrated value was higher than the default the delay time gw delay is the time water takes to join the deep aquifer test wells have been utilized in various studies to estimate the delay time and it was recommended that the same values of the variable can be used for neighboring watersheds with similar geological conditions campbell 1986 the gwmnq represents the limiting water depth in the shallow aquifer for which the return flow would occur groundwater replenishes if the water depth in an aquifer is more than this variable curve number cn2 is an important variable reported as soil conservation service scs runoff curve number it depends on land use type soil water interaction conditions and permeability of soil in the basin bauwe et al 2016 each land use class in lrrb fig 2 as per the supervised classification map corresponds to a specific curve number value the agricultural area of the watershed comprises of close seeded contoured and terraced rotational crops grass with wild herbs and fruit tree farms awan and ismaeel 2014 the urbanized area is heavily dominated by residential districts with average impervious areas rana and bhatti 2018 the cn2 value for the agricultural area is estimated to be 37 and for urban area 51 the calculated mean value for watershed is 40 8 however the model was calibrated at 39 as the variable depends upon a number of other factors like soil conditions and elevation of the watershed etc several researchers have highlighted inconsistencies in this variable and have devised methods of improving it for agricultural dominated watersheds rajib and merwade 2016 wang et al 2008 the cn2 enlisted table 1 is the watershed mean value table 2 represents the monthly water balance components of the basin including surface runoff surf q potential evapotranspiration pet and evapotranspiration et for the baseline period the performance evaluation of the swat model for surface runoff simulated for the baseline period between 1991 and 2005 is represented in table 3 the difference was 3 71 in annual mean precipitation and 3 38 in the surface runoff the model performance was further adjudicated by three statistical indicators namely nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse percentage bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 as represented in table 4 the statistical parameters represent a significant improvement in modelling due to improvements during calibration and validation the r2 score improved from 0 83 to 0 87 with a significant reduction of pbias by 2 46 for that monthly period fig 4 represents the comparison of simulated and observed discharge at balloki barrage discharge station and the corresponding evaluation of the model s hydrological response for calibration and validation periods 3 2 gcm output data the major inputs of the swat model for future impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge are meteorological datasets the output of all three gcms after bias correction was analyzed and compared with present data the mean monthly variations of the climate parameters namely maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation were compared for both rcp scenarios with the baseline data in fig 5 ccsm4 showed a reduction of 2 97 c in february rcp8 5 had a maximum rise of 4 76 c in october the 2030s for rcp4 5 the maximum temperature suggested colder winters and hotter summers the overall rain of the basin exhibited an increasing trend our findings are similar to dahal et al 2020 who reported that the minimum temperature for kathmandu valley nepal is projected to be significantly higher than that of the future maximum temperature for various climate models interestingly the peak rainfall season was seen to be shifting a month later from august to september the rainfall with this shift was seen to rise to 126 7 mms for rcp 4 5 and to 134 75 mm for rcp 8 5 in the 2030s in the 2050s the average rise was 169 84 mm and specifically september it was 175 39 mm for the similar region liaqat et al 2021 has shown that future precipitation is going to increase under various land use and climate change scenarios in contrast mpi depicted a rising trend in temperatures throughout the year with a maximum rise of 4 13 c in july for rcp8 5 in the 2050s under both rcp scenarios the rainfall trends decreased for both scenarios and future periods during the winter season similarly to ccsm4 the seasonal shift was prominent however the increase in rainfall was 50 mms lower than the ccsm4 projections miroc5 projected a rise in temperature in the initial and final months while slightly decreasing during the middle months the maximum rise of 4 91 c was projected in april as the minimum temperature for rcp8 5 in the 2050s the overall assessment of the future projections depicts a rise in seasonal temperatures the selection of gcms was justified as the projection variation was reflected more or less uniformly in the ensemble mean for both rcp scenarios the variation of rainfall was prominent as compared to present baseline data with a rise in the average annual rainfall the average monthly changes in climatic parameters for these gcms along with their ensemble mean under both rcp scenarios and two future periods are shown in fig 5 3 3 future land use maps the future maps for the years 2030 and 2050 were generated from the ca markov land use model using present land use maps and are represented in fig 6 there there was a significant change in land use classes the difference in the areas for each class was one of the indicators of how the land use is going to change in the future it was predominantly seen that agricultural land was decreasing and urbanization was increasing the reduction in agricultural land by 6 74 in 2030 and 10 38 in 2050 was projected rana and bhatti 2018 also showed that the population of lahore is expected to increase in the future there was negligible change in the remaining classes throughout the projection period hence the agricultural land is projected to be converted in urban areas the figures that follow represent the corresponding values of the transformation by year 2030 and 2050 3 4 groundwater recharge under different scenarios as per section 2 7 the baseline recharge in the basin combined with the resultant recharge under climate change scenario is shown in fig 7 by average monthly time series charts the monthly trend of recharge projected by ccsm4 for both rcp scenarios was the same as the trend of baseline recharge the recharge was projected to increase under changed climate conditions an increase in recharge by 2 62 and 6 21 was observed for the 2030s and 2050s for rcp 4 5 using ccsm4 projections respectively under rcp8 5 in comparison to baseline recharge a rise of 12 9 and 20 44 in recharge was projected for 2030s and 2050s respectively these comparisons are drawn for peak recharge values for the month of august in the basin this gcm projected increased rainfall in the basin with a consequent a rise in the recharge values the miroc5 gcm forecasted decrease in recharge for peak month under rcp4 5 and rise for rcp8 5 for the future periods the reduction of recharge in the month of august was 11 for the 2030s and 16 87 for 2050s under rcp4 5 whereas the increase in recharge for the same month was 11 44 for 2030s and 8 17 for 2050s mpi showed an overall reduction in monthly recharge to about 17 under both scenarios the rcp4 5 showed more reduction than rcp 8 5 the peaks showed significant shifts from august to september and recharge was seen to percolate with the same temporal rates as in baseline recharge the ensemble of three depicted a maximum rise in recharge by 8 82 for rcp4 5 and 14 3 for rcp8 5 in august hence the overall results of the climate change scenario evaluate an increase in recharge in the basin for upcoming years the results are in line with usman et al 2020 who showed an increasing trend in water level recharge in a similar region in pakistan fig 8 represents the spatial variation of recharge for the base line period the future land use change impacts on groundwater recharge are shown through average monthly time series charts in fig 9 and spatial charts in fig 10 it is evident that as urbanization keeps on increasing the recharge is going to decrease this is the reason that continuous fall in recharge is seen by the lapse of time there was no change in the recharge patterns throughout the year however the decrease in peaks was observed for all the future land use considerations for the land use of 2030 with the same climatic conditions as in the baseline a reduction in recharge to about 33 was projected similarly for 2050 a decline was seen in recharge amounting to 42 consequently presuming that land use is going to impact more than climate change urbanization increases employ changes in recharging areas too the spatial charts show the variation of the difference of recharge in the basin as compared to the baseline recharge more evidently the conversion of agricultural lands to urban areas is going to reduce groundwater percolation hence the overall results of land use change scenarios evaluate a drastic reduction in recharge in the basin for upcoming years the fourth scenario incorporating both land use change for the 2030s and 2050s and climate change using the ensemble output of climate from gcms showed significant impacts on groundwater recharge and are represented in figs 11 and 12 as projected in these scenarios separately the slight increase in recharge was dwarfed by a significant reduction due to land use change scenarios hence the combined impacts on recharge showed an overall reduction in groundwater recharge the recharge in the 2030s was decreased by 27 69 and 41 87 for 2050s under rcp4 5 while a reduction of 32 in 2030s and 44 85 in 2050s was observed for the rcp8 5 scenario the spatial variation depicted the same it was seen that combined changes in climate and land use will hamper groundwater recharge the most the monthly variation in the recharge under these scenarios fig 11 is in line with the findings of awan and ismaeel 2014 the summary of results is represented in table 5 4 discussions and conclusions the planning and development program for groundwater of lahore city is governed by lwasa currently the long term sustainability of groundwater is under serious threat as no plan is in action to compare recharge and abstractions there are no legislations on groundwater abstractions and almost all the household and industrial needs are fulfilled through groundwater thereby making the aquifer overstressed the future demands of groundwater will grow with rapid urbanization and population surge there are no serious efforts taken into consideration to help recharging to the aquifer through surface water bodies such as the ravi river extensive withdrawals will cause a tremendous decline in groundwater levels additionally climate change will pose serious threats to the natural mechanisms of recharge combined with rapid urbanization in the years to come the projected future climate was incorporated in a calibrated hydrological model swat for the estimation of groundwater recharge the estimated recharge was found different from the current recharge the recharge is estimated to be increased in the monsoon months july and august while it will decrease in the dry season a rise in recharge was projected in the winter season owing to larger precipitations the increase in recharge under the rcp 4 5 scenario was 4 46 while for rcp 8 5 it was 9 48 the minimum recharge in the northern portion of the watershed is due to urbanized lahore city the recharge was seen to decrease under land use change as it showed a continuous decline while going from the land use of 2030 2050 on average a reduction of 36 in the recharge was seen in recharge under land use change finally the impacts of both climate change and land use change were seen on groundwater recharge the combined input revealed that recharge will decrease as compared to the present conditions by 15 as projected in this research urbanization will be more critical aiding reduction in recharge with additional pressure on the aquifer groundwater mining can be reduced by effective management policies and implementing strict rules on users regarding over exploitations pakistan needs to adopt appropriate strategic policies and regulation plans to aid artificial recharging through the ravi river especially during wet seasons where enormous quantities of water flow through the riverbed small structures inside the riverbed can be constructed for keeping the flowing water stagnant to help its percolation to join the underground reservoir techniques like rainwater harvesting in addition to low urban development planning and adopting climate change strategies may lead to the sustainable aquifer in the ravi river for the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest 
11836,climate and land use change significantly impact the hydrological cycle and water resources groundwater recharge of the lower ravi river basin lrrb pakistan using the soil and water assessment tool swat hydrological model was studied three general circulation models gcms under two representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 were used to project future rainfall and temperature present climate and land use were used to develop the swat model future land use was generated by using land use change predictor model ca markov from present maps groundwater recharge fluctuated with changing climate and land use with an increase of annual temperature by 2 1 c and 3 7 c for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively by 2050 the annual mean precipitation increased by 2 45 and 4 47 for both scenarios resulting in an 8 rise in recharge along with a seasonal shift future land use change reduced recharge up to 38 the combined impacts of climate and land use change reduced groundwater recharge by 15 graphical abstract image 1 keywords climate change groundwater recharge land use change lower ravi river basin swat 1 introduction climate change is one of the biggest challenges for mankind in the 21st century freshwater availability will be limited due to ice melting temperature changes and sea level rise global average annual temperatures have risen to 0 87 c which has caused sea levels to rise to 52 98 cm ipcc 2019 increasing trends in the population are encouraging urbanization which is currently the main cause of land use change pakistan has the highest urbanization rate among others in south asia and as per the census conducted in 2017 about 36 4 of the country s population was living in the urban areas whereas this figure was 32 5 in the census of 1998 undp 2018 in the context of lahore the second most populous city of pakistan more than 90 of the population lives in city district area and owing to factors like rapid urbanization the establishment of new industrial zones and residential towns etc more and more people relocate rana and bhatti 2018 humanity is striving to make life easier which puts stress on natural resources supply dipping into those which are needed to fulfil the requirements of the future the influence of climate change and changing land use patterns have serious consequences on the water resources of different systems for different regions liaqat et al 2021 yang et al 2019 it is imperative to consider future climate change and land use change patterns before any water resource schemes are planned afzal and ragab 2019 pakistan is one of the most vulnerable countries susceptible to the consequences of climate change and may face extreme weather events like droughts and floods ipcc 2019 pakistan has faced several floods in recent years in 2010 record breaking rains hit the northern province khyber pakhtunkhwa and punjab causing massive flooding in almost all areas of pakistan about 2000 people died leaving 20 million people affected by the disaster shah et al 2018 river ravi is one of the major rivers flowing through lahore the river remained a great source of domestic water supplies and agriculture for years basharat and rizvi 2011 after the partition of the sub continent into india and pakistan in 1960 a treaty was signed between two countries giving the rights of eastern rivers to india river ravi was one of these and is now facing the problem of drying up in low flow spells occurring from october until may no significant discharge is released to the river from the indian border these low flow conditions have many consequences including but not restricted to environmental mahmood et al 2011 and groundwater replenishment processes malana and khosa 2011 generally runoffs are generated from rainfall in the upper mountainous reaches of the ravi river basin and run through plain areas to join the indus river which is the largest river system in pakistan the runoff from the upper reaches significantly impacts the irrigation and household water systems downstream the forest area is reduced due to larger lumber demands while continuous urbanization adds pressure to the groundwater recharge reduced inflows to water reservoirs also put stress on groundwater recharge making its extraction alarming as compared to annual recharge basharat and rizvi 2011 the groundwater level in lrrb especially in the densely populated city of lahore is extraordinarily depleting owing to rapid abstraction as compared to the recharge according to water and sanitation agency lahore lwasa the annual depletion rate has been estimated to be about 0 57 1 35 m due to unregulated abstraction and no recharging efforts the maximum water table depth in 2011 was 45 m with an annual groundwater withdrawal of about 1161 mcm million cubic meters currently the recharge to groundwater is estimated at 1013 mcm including inflows from boundaries in comparison to the abstracted amount of 1161 mcm on annual basis which provided a difference of 15 between abstraction and recharge river ravi was the major source of groundwater recharge to the aquifer till 2000 but its flow has come to an almost dead level due to dams constructed upstream in the indian territory such regulatory flows have significantly reduced recharge in the river which is a serious issue concerning the water demands in the future with drastic depletion rate in groundwater level basharat 2020 in the case of shortages of surface water supplies groundwater becomes the only lifeline for survival in many parts of the world cook et al 2018 rapid population growth urbanization inconsiderate water distribution and consumption practices in pakistan have an adverse effect on the quantity as well as the quality of groundwater resources in addition the region is unsustainable in terms of freshwater resources and is already prone to severe water stress ali 2021 the recharge is contributed through river water which is mainly contributed by heavy precipitations in the monsoon season this shallow aquifer is also replenished by the seepage from lakes rivers and irrigation canals which may take groundwater polluting agents along ahmad et al 2001 gabriel and khan 2010 considered climate change combined with urban water management for a sustainable aquifer groundwater flow model modflow was developed for the study area the results showed an unsustainable aquifer consequently they proposed different management options for the stressed aquifer of lahore city in pakistan it was concluded that the aquifer is highly pressurized with low recharge and extraordinary abstractions basharat and rizvi 2011 studied the contours and groundwater levels from the depth of water table in lahore city in 2009 to visualize the present groundwater flow directions the map showed a depression of about 36 m deep within a radius of about 25 km under lahore city this is caused by concentrated pumping and the least recharge to the aquifer muhammad et al 2015 studied groundwater vulnerability assessment in lahore city using the drastic model according to his findings areas under high risk moderate risk and no risks were 28 8 46 3 and 10 4 respectively mahmood et al 2011 conducted quantitative measurements of groundwater depressions using geographical information system gis there was a depression zone in groundwater level below 38 m and its expansion at an average rate of 24 5 km squared per year was identified apart from climate change land use changes significantly affect the hydrological cycle of a basin the rapid urbanization in lahore city was studied by bhalli and ghaffar 2015 the land use generated maps revealed that the areal expansion is mainly attributed to the loss of agricultural land and its conversion to urban areas an increase of about 40 81 was seen in the urban areas with a significant reduction in the agricultural land area of about 12 98 from 2000 to 2014 fahad et al 2021 reported the impacts of land use changes on the water cycle specifically concentrating upon the mean annual runoff of the region hydrological models are vital tools to study the effects of land use change on the hydrological cycle karvonen et al 1999 groundwater systems can be better understood using computer based numerical models as hydrological models are best predictive for handling groundwater in aquifers yao et al 2015 one example of a hydrological model is the soil and water assessment tool swat it has been used extensively worldwide for hydrological modeling it acts as a multi functional model with optimization of fewer parameters as compared to many in other hydrological models the swat model predominantly analyses the relationship between precipitation and consequently generated runoff rostamian et al 2008 impacts of climate change on hydrological cycle x zhang srinivasan and hao 2007 impacts of land use change on the water cycle of a basin l zhang et al 2020 and sediment load kuti and ewemoje 2021 the swat model can also be coupled with other hydrological models to simulate the impacts of land use patterns of landscape functions senent aparicio et al 2020 the core of this hydrological study is to assess the influence of future climate change and land use change on the water balance of the lrrb which is yet to be explored climate change is responsible for alterations in amount and the allocation of precipitation and regional temperature thereby having direct impacts on catchment runoff the hydrological system of the basin is analyzed based on historical meteorological data and a hydrological model named swat is utilized for hydrological simulations and impacts of climate change land use change and a combination of both on groundwater recharge in the basin considering climate change and land use change scenarios this study is an essential contribution towards the hydrological response of ravi river to craft management strategies for sustainable consumption of groundwater resources in the region and preservation of the ecosystem the results of this research have shown that the future climate in the area is going to alter the set of gcms used to project the future climate revealed that the rise in future annual temperature in the study area under rcp4 5 was expected to be 2 1 c whereas for rcp 8 5 it was 3 7 c the future annual precipitation is expected to increase by 2 45 and 4 47 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively the rise in precipitation resulted in an 8 rise in recharge along with a seasonal shift the future land use change reduced recharge up to 38 the combined impacts of climate and land use change reduced groundwater recharge by 15 2 materials and method 2 1 study area ravi river originates from the himalayas in the multhan tehsil of kangra district himachal pradesh india it is a perennial river of the province punjab which was divided into pakistan and india after their independence in 1947 as reported by the water commission of india commission 2019 the annual flow in india is about 11 52 million acre feet maf most of this water is stored in madhopur headworks in india and approximately 4 54 maf is released downstream across the country boundary in pakistan punjab irrigation department 2016 at the entrance in pakistan there is a gauging station at jassar the river course from jassar till the joining into the chenab river is considered as lrrb with a catchment area of 680 km2 the upper reach of the basin has ample urban cover while the remaining part is densely irrigated land and patchy forest area the location map of lrrb in north east pakistan is shown in fig 1 the basic inputs to the swat model are the digital elevation model dem land use soil and slope maps the upper reach of the basin has higher altitudes as compared to the lower with flat slopes the soil of the basin is broadly classified as sandy loam the major land use classes are crops grasslands urban and water fig 2 represents the spatial inputs for lrrb pakistan the principal data used in model simulation includes daily precipitation temperature humidity wind speed solar radiation and discharge data for the baseline period 1991 2005 the meteorological data was obtained from the pakistan meteorological department lahore office through personal communication while the discharge data for balloki barrage station was obtained from punjab irrigation department refer to fig 1 the dem was obtained from the united states department of geological survey for the hydrological model a soil map for the model was downloaded from food and agriculture organization fao punjab land use department statistics were used to generate supervised classification land use maps of the study area for the years 2000 2007 and 2012 the general methodology is shown in fig 3 2 2 downscaling and bias correction of gcm data generally gcms have a coarse resolution and are unable to represent the fine scale processes franklin et al 2013 this resolution is not enough to analyze the impacts precisely therefore the gcm data before use requires downscaling for a specific area it is recommended to have several climate observation station points for areas with a sudden change in topography or heterogeneous land use types wilby et al 2004 gcms are frequently used for future projections of climate and yet possess certain uncertainty based on their initial conditions and implementation processes asseng et al 2013 several gcms are recommended for reliable estimation of climate parameters in the future mendes et al 2017 qmap technique of statistical downscaling and bias correction of raw data of all the three gcms namely community climate system model ccsm4 max planck institute earth system model mpi and model for interdisciplinary research on climate miroc5 was utilized in this study as they have shown satisfactory results in the region aslam et al 2020 bias correction of gcm data is equally important for water resources especially impacts studies in which coarse resolution gcm data is translated into high temporal and spatial resolution data maraun et al 2010 it can be done by several methods one of the statistical downscaling and bias correction methods is quantile mapping qmap in this technique the quantiles for observed and gcm data are compared by interpolation through a transfer function between the corresponding quantiles linear approximation of the qmap function is used for the consequential modifications this corresponds to a linear mapping function defined through the points of grids aslam et al 2020 different climate change scenarios were developed as they better represent the uncertain future mäkelä et al 2020 above mentioned gcms were coupled with the hydrological model to generate future scenarios under two rcps namely 4 5 and 8 5 2 3 ca markov land use model cellular automata and the markov ca markov is used to simulate the future quantitative as well as spatial characteristics of land use in lrrb for years 2030 and 2050 based on the land use data sets of 2000 2007 and 2012 markov is a process defined as the state of a system that can be predicted at a time state by taking a certain time as the basis by generating a matrix of transition probabilities from one cover class to the other hyandye and martz 2017 different combinations and multiple category land use changes can be simulated by using the ca markov module the basics of this projection include the generation of a transition probability matrix ca markov module utilizes this matrix for analysis of future land use conditions memarian et al 2012 a transition area matrix expresses the total area expected to be changed in the next time step the conditional probability expresses the belonging of a pixel to a certain category of the class in a land use map the outputs of the process are referred to as conditional probability maps as the probability is conditional to their current state subedi et al 2013 ca markov performs a chain analysis in integrated geographic information system software this helps in the generation of a transition matrix between past land use maps and estimates the probabilities of change in future projections of land use the spatial visualization of land use map is also possible using this model 2 4 hydrological model swat the hydrological model used in the simulation of groundwater recharge is swat it is a semi distributed process based hydrological model with the capability to operate and simulate under different climate and land use scenarios it can generate long term hydrological changes using the inputs based on daily as well as monthly time steps consequently the model is preferred in impact assessment studies involving climate change land use change and policy management etc bhatta et al 2019 eq 1 shows the basic water balance equation governed by the model as expressed by nasiri et al 2020 1 s w t sw o i 1 t r d a y q s u r f a c e e a w s e e p q g w where swt mm represents the final soil water content sw0 mm represents the initial soil water content time in days is shown as t rday mm is the amount of precipitation on an ith day qsurface mm is the amount of surface runoff on that particular day ea mm is the amount of evapotranspiration wseep mm is the amount of water that enters the vadose zone from the soil profile and qgw represents the amount of water contributing to the groundwater recharge in mm swat model uses two methods to calculate the runoff of a certain watershed first is the runoff curve number method which is developed by the soil conservation service scs united states department of agriculture and the second is the green ampt infiltration method green w h ampt 1911 the runoff curve method is used in this study as proven to be better than the green ampt infiltration method senent aparicio et al 2020 the potential evapotranspiration is calculated by the conventional penman monteith equation the soil evaporation is dependent upon soil depth soil moisture and potential evapotranspiration while vegetation transpiration is a function of the growth status of vegetation evapotranspiration leaf area index and soil root depth the kinematic storage model presented by sloan and moore 1984 calculates the inflow through the soil the model considers the hydrological conductance of soil its slope and the spatial and temporal changes of the soil moisture the model calculates the base flow using eq 2 as follows 2 q gw i q gw i 1 exp α gw δt w rchrg 1 exp α gw δt where the term qgw i mm represents the groundwater flow into the river on a given day i similarly qgw i 1 is the flow on the day i 1 αgw is the constant for base flow recession in time δt which is time step 1 day and wrchrg mm is the amount of water contributing to the groundwater recharge 2 5 swat model setup the first step in the model setup was watershed delineation the number of sub basins and stream networks was decided based on a threshold input area this area signifies the drainage pattern required to start the stream processing the model performance and number of sub basins have an inverse relationship if the number of sub basins is increased the performance of the model can be compromised romanowicz et al 2005 the outlet of the whole basin was taken just downstream of balloki barrage swat divided the whole basin into 45 sub basins hydraulic response units hru are the smallest units representing an area with unique land use and soil features the model calculates the runoff for each hru and takes the sum of each to estimate the total runoff from the basin the basic entities for hru generation include land use maps soil maps and slopes the available land use data was used to carry out supervised classification and present land use maps were generated as the area was flat the slope was divided into two classes namely 0 5 and greater than 5 fao 1995 to avoid the formation of too many and smaller hrus a 10 threshold value was set for all land use soil and slope respectively to optimize the number of hrus the swat model usually recommends a value ranging between 5 and 20 larose et al 2007 this enhances the computational efficiency of the model the model generated 133 hrus and 45 sub basins in the basin the outputs were used to compare the observed data downstream of the balloki barrage for the calibration and validation of the swat model 2 6 groundwater recharge scenarios to comprehend the impacts of climate change and land use change on groundwater recharge this study was divided into four scenarios the first case is the baseline in which current climate and land use were incorporated in the hydrological model to get the baseline recharge in the watershed secondly with the baseline monthly average recharge future recharge for only climate change scenarios was found by the input of future climate in the calibrated model this was done for all three gcms individually the recharge to groundwater was studied for two rcp scenarios the input to the model was sub divided into two future periods namely 2030s 2021 2040 and 2050s 2041 2060 the third scenario was developed by keeping the baseline climate and incorporating the land use change in the model for this purpose the current land use was generated by supervised classification for the study area the generated maps were used as inputs to the land use change model the land use change model was used to generate future changes in the land use for the study area land use change maps for the years 2030 and 2050 were generated after the development of future land use maps the swat model was run with baseline climate and future land use map once for each of the above listed years the fourth scenario for assessing the impacts on groundwater recharge was developed by a combination of climate and land use changes the distribution of a specific future climate with a specific future land use was developed the future climate range was taken from the year 2021 2060 while land use maps were used for the years 2030 and 2050 the combinations were the mean average climate of 2021 2040 with a land use map of 2030 and mean average climate of 2041 2060 and land use of 2050 swat model was run for these combinations this process helped in the assessment of groundwater recharge under land use and climate change collectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 calibration and validation of swat model sensitivity analysis for the swat model parameters was carried out in this study as recommended by larbi et al 2020 the most sensitive model parameters associated with the groundwater along with their default values and the fitted values for calibration are enlisted in table 1 the deep aquifer percolation fraction rchrg dp is the fraction of water percolating from the root zone and contributing to the deep aquifer recharge in contrast the groundwater revap coefficient gw revap is associated with the water that moves from the shallow aquifer to the partially saturated overlying zone it is identical to capillary action in which water diffuses into the upper unsaturated soil layers a part of this coefficient can also be the water taken up by the deep rooted plants that absorb water from the shallow aquifer miskewitz 2007 although the saturated zone of soil is not very shallow for lrrb but the root depth is significant and the majority of land cover is agricultural type hence the calibrated value was higher than the default the delay time gw delay is the time water takes to join the deep aquifer test wells have been utilized in various studies to estimate the delay time and it was recommended that the same values of the variable can be used for neighboring watersheds with similar geological conditions campbell 1986 the gwmnq represents the limiting water depth in the shallow aquifer for which the return flow would occur groundwater replenishes if the water depth in an aquifer is more than this variable curve number cn2 is an important variable reported as soil conservation service scs runoff curve number it depends on land use type soil water interaction conditions and permeability of soil in the basin bauwe et al 2016 each land use class in lrrb fig 2 as per the supervised classification map corresponds to a specific curve number value the agricultural area of the watershed comprises of close seeded contoured and terraced rotational crops grass with wild herbs and fruit tree farms awan and ismaeel 2014 the urbanized area is heavily dominated by residential districts with average impervious areas rana and bhatti 2018 the cn2 value for the agricultural area is estimated to be 37 and for urban area 51 the calculated mean value for watershed is 40 8 however the model was calibrated at 39 as the variable depends upon a number of other factors like soil conditions and elevation of the watershed etc several researchers have highlighted inconsistencies in this variable and have devised methods of improving it for agricultural dominated watersheds rajib and merwade 2016 wang et al 2008 the cn2 enlisted table 1 is the watershed mean value table 2 represents the monthly water balance components of the basin including surface runoff surf q potential evapotranspiration pet and evapotranspiration et for the baseline period the performance evaluation of the swat model for surface runoff simulated for the baseline period between 1991 and 2005 is represented in table 3 the difference was 3 71 in annual mean precipitation and 3 38 in the surface runoff the model performance was further adjudicated by three statistical indicators namely nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse percentage bias pbias and coefficient of determination r2 as represented in table 4 the statistical parameters represent a significant improvement in modelling due to improvements during calibration and validation the r2 score improved from 0 83 to 0 87 with a significant reduction of pbias by 2 46 for that monthly period fig 4 represents the comparison of simulated and observed discharge at balloki barrage discharge station and the corresponding evaluation of the model s hydrological response for calibration and validation periods 3 2 gcm output data the major inputs of the swat model for future impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge are meteorological datasets the output of all three gcms after bias correction was analyzed and compared with present data the mean monthly variations of the climate parameters namely maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation were compared for both rcp scenarios with the baseline data in fig 5 ccsm4 showed a reduction of 2 97 c in february rcp8 5 had a maximum rise of 4 76 c in october the 2030s for rcp4 5 the maximum temperature suggested colder winters and hotter summers the overall rain of the basin exhibited an increasing trend our findings are similar to dahal et al 2020 who reported that the minimum temperature for kathmandu valley nepal is projected to be significantly higher than that of the future maximum temperature for various climate models interestingly the peak rainfall season was seen to be shifting a month later from august to september the rainfall with this shift was seen to rise to 126 7 mms for rcp 4 5 and to 134 75 mm for rcp 8 5 in the 2030s in the 2050s the average rise was 169 84 mm and specifically september it was 175 39 mm for the similar region liaqat et al 2021 has shown that future precipitation is going to increase under various land use and climate change scenarios in contrast mpi depicted a rising trend in temperatures throughout the year with a maximum rise of 4 13 c in july for rcp8 5 in the 2050s under both rcp scenarios the rainfall trends decreased for both scenarios and future periods during the winter season similarly to ccsm4 the seasonal shift was prominent however the increase in rainfall was 50 mms lower than the ccsm4 projections miroc5 projected a rise in temperature in the initial and final months while slightly decreasing during the middle months the maximum rise of 4 91 c was projected in april as the minimum temperature for rcp8 5 in the 2050s the overall assessment of the future projections depicts a rise in seasonal temperatures the selection of gcms was justified as the projection variation was reflected more or less uniformly in the ensemble mean for both rcp scenarios the variation of rainfall was prominent as compared to present baseline data with a rise in the average annual rainfall the average monthly changes in climatic parameters for these gcms along with their ensemble mean under both rcp scenarios and two future periods are shown in fig 5 3 3 future land use maps the future maps for the years 2030 and 2050 were generated from the ca markov land use model using present land use maps and are represented in fig 6 there there was a significant change in land use classes the difference in the areas for each class was one of the indicators of how the land use is going to change in the future it was predominantly seen that agricultural land was decreasing and urbanization was increasing the reduction in agricultural land by 6 74 in 2030 and 10 38 in 2050 was projected rana and bhatti 2018 also showed that the population of lahore is expected to increase in the future there was negligible change in the remaining classes throughout the projection period hence the agricultural land is projected to be converted in urban areas the figures that follow represent the corresponding values of the transformation by year 2030 and 2050 3 4 groundwater recharge under different scenarios as per section 2 7 the baseline recharge in the basin combined with the resultant recharge under climate change scenario is shown in fig 7 by average monthly time series charts the monthly trend of recharge projected by ccsm4 for both rcp scenarios was the same as the trend of baseline recharge the recharge was projected to increase under changed climate conditions an increase in recharge by 2 62 and 6 21 was observed for the 2030s and 2050s for rcp 4 5 using ccsm4 projections respectively under rcp8 5 in comparison to baseline recharge a rise of 12 9 and 20 44 in recharge was projected for 2030s and 2050s respectively these comparisons are drawn for peak recharge values for the month of august in the basin this gcm projected increased rainfall in the basin with a consequent a rise in the recharge values the miroc5 gcm forecasted decrease in recharge for peak month under rcp4 5 and rise for rcp8 5 for the future periods the reduction of recharge in the month of august was 11 for the 2030s and 16 87 for 2050s under rcp4 5 whereas the increase in recharge for the same month was 11 44 for 2030s and 8 17 for 2050s mpi showed an overall reduction in monthly recharge to about 17 under both scenarios the rcp4 5 showed more reduction than rcp 8 5 the peaks showed significant shifts from august to september and recharge was seen to percolate with the same temporal rates as in baseline recharge the ensemble of three depicted a maximum rise in recharge by 8 82 for rcp4 5 and 14 3 for rcp8 5 in august hence the overall results of the climate change scenario evaluate an increase in recharge in the basin for upcoming years the results are in line with usman et al 2020 who showed an increasing trend in water level recharge in a similar region in pakistan fig 8 represents the spatial variation of recharge for the base line period the future land use change impacts on groundwater recharge are shown through average monthly time series charts in fig 9 and spatial charts in fig 10 it is evident that as urbanization keeps on increasing the recharge is going to decrease this is the reason that continuous fall in recharge is seen by the lapse of time there was no change in the recharge patterns throughout the year however the decrease in peaks was observed for all the future land use considerations for the land use of 2030 with the same climatic conditions as in the baseline a reduction in recharge to about 33 was projected similarly for 2050 a decline was seen in recharge amounting to 42 consequently presuming that land use is going to impact more than climate change urbanization increases employ changes in recharging areas too the spatial charts show the variation of the difference of recharge in the basin as compared to the baseline recharge more evidently the conversion of agricultural lands to urban areas is going to reduce groundwater percolation hence the overall results of land use change scenarios evaluate a drastic reduction in recharge in the basin for upcoming years the fourth scenario incorporating both land use change for the 2030s and 2050s and climate change using the ensemble output of climate from gcms showed significant impacts on groundwater recharge and are represented in figs 11 and 12 as projected in these scenarios separately the slight increase in recharge was dwarfed by a significant reduction due to land use change scenarios hence the combined impacts on recharge showed an overall reduction in groundwater recharge the recharge in the 2030s was decreased by 27 69 and 41 87 for 2050s under rcp4 5 while a reduction of 32 in 2030s and 44 85 in 2050s was observed for the rcp8 5 scenario the spatial variation depicted the same it was seen that combined changes in climate and land use will hamper groundwater recharge the most the monthly variation in the recharge under these scenarios fig 11 is in line with the findings of awan and ismaeel 2014 the summary of results is represented in table 5 4 discussions and conclusions the planning and development program for groundwater of lahore city is governed by lwasa currently the long term sustainability of groundwater is under serious threat as no plan is in action to compare recharge and abstractions there are no legislations on groundwater abstractions and almost all the household and industrial needs are fulfilled through groundwater thereby making the aquifer overstressed the future demands of groundwater will grow with rapid urbanization and population surge there are no serious efforts taken into consideration to help recharging to the aquifer through surface water bodies such as the ravi river extensive withdrawals will cause a tremendous decline in groundwater levels additionally climate change will pose serious threats to the natural mechanisms of recharge combined with rapid urbanization in the years to come the projected future climate was incorporated in a calibrated hydrological model swat for the estimation of groundwater recharge the estimated recharge was found different from the current recharge the recharge is estimated to be increased in the monsoon months july and august while it will decrease in the dry season a rise in recharge was projected in the winter season owing to larger precipitations the increase in recharge under the rcp 4 5 scenario was 4 46 while for rcp 8 5 it was 9 48 the minimum recharge in the northern portion of the watershed is due to urbanized lahore city the recharge was seen to decrease under land use change as it showed a continuous decline while going from the land use of 2030 2050 on average a reduction of 36 in the recharge was seen in recharge under land use change finally the impacts of both climate change and land use change were seen on groundwater recharge the combined input revealed that recharge will decrease as compared to the present conditions by 15 as projected in this research urbanization will be more critical aiding reduction in recharge with additional pressure on the aquifer groundwater mining can be reduced by effective management policies and implementing strict rules on users regarding over exploitations pakistan needs to adopt appropriate strategic policies and regulation plans to aid artificial recharging through the ravi river especially during wet seasons where enormous quantities of water flow through the riverbed small structures inside the riverbed can be constructed for keeping the flowing water stagnant to help its percolation to join the underground reservoir techniques like rainwater harvesting in addition to low urban development planning and adopting climate change strategies may lead to the sustainable aquifer in the ravi river for the future

palm empty fruit bunches was in two different dimension namely microcrystalline mcc and nanocrystalline cellulose ncc the physicochemical properties of the membrane were evaluated in this study it was found that the hydrophilicity of the membrane was elevated by the presence of cellulose filler this also led to reduce the porosity of the membrane but on the other hand increase the pure water flux

antifouling properties of pvdf membranes which could prolong life span of the membrane unfortunately the effect of cellulose dimension and size is not mentioned in previous studies nevertheless the particle size of the filler also affects the properties and performance of the membrane kang et al 2016 song et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to study the effect of particle size of cellulose fiber toward the properties of resulted pvdf cellulose composite this study performed an extraction of cellulose from opefb with two different dimension size namely microcrystalline and nanocrystalline cellulose both of cellulose were used as filler on pvdf membrane and evaluate their performance on the physical properties and separation ability toward ha sample 2 experimental 2 1 materials oil palm empty fruit bunch was obtained from indonesian palm oil plantation in kalimantan polyvinylidene fluoride solef pvdf was purchased from solvay with molecular weight 300 kda n n dimethylacetamide dmac merck sodium hypochlorite bratachem sodium hydroxide merck sulfuric acid merck were other chemicals used in this research 2 2 extraction of micro and nano cellulose from oil palm empty fruit bunches the cellulose extraction procedure was followed our previous work saputra et al 2021 the pretreated of opefb by alkalization and bleaching reagent was further hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid 45 for 45 min at 45 c to acquire mcc the ncc was obtained by treating of mcc with 10 h2so4 via ultrasonication method the ncc product was washed until reaching neutral ph and dried using freeze drying machine 2 3 fabrication of pvdf cellulose membranes fabrication membrane using phase inversion following our previous work pramono et al 2019 the cellulose mcc or ncc was dispersed in dmac for 10 min afterward peg400 and pvdf were subsequently added into the suspension and stirred for 24 h at 60 c the dope solution was casted on glass plate and immersed in water coagulant bath the membrane was collected and stored in glycerin solution for further analysis the composition of each components on preparation of the membranes is shown in table 1 2 4 characterization the membranes were characterized using following instruments and methods such as atr ftir sem water contact angle and porosity measurement the functional group of the sample was analyzed using atr ftir in addition the polymorph α and β phases in pvdf were also identified using this instrument which recorded from 500 to 4000 cm 1 the β phases faction f β was calculated using eq 1 1 f β a β 1 26 a α a β aα and aβ are the absorption peak of α and β phases at 763 cm 1 and 840 cm 1 respectively water contact angle was measured to evaluate hydrophilicity properties of membrane by dropping water on the membrane surfaces the image was captured with super macro camera and analyzed with imagej software membrane porosity was measured with gravimetric method the membranes were immersed in water and wiped carefully to remove the excess water the membrane wet weight wwet and thickness l were measured afterward then membranes were dried in oven at 60 c for 24 h the dry membrane was weighted wdry and thickness ldry of dry membranes was measured the membrane porosity was calculated using eq 2 floros et al 2020 2 ε w w e t w d r y a l d r y ρ cross section and top view of surface membranes were investigated by using sem the membrane was immersed in liquid nitrogen and further fractured immediately 2 5 study of membrane performances the membrane performance was analyzed in three stages namely the determination of pure water flux rejection and anti fouling frr determination of pure water flux was carried out by installing a membrane sample with a diameter of 5 cm in a stirred cell with a dead end system the stirred cell was filled with distilled water as feed and compaction was conducted for 15 min at a pressure of 2 bar then the permeate was collected and the water flux denoted as j1 was determined by eq 3 rejection of the membrane was performed in the next stage by changing the feed using a 100 mg l 1 humic acid solution and compacting again for 15 min the membrane rejection is determined by eq 4 3 j v a t 4 r 1 c p c r 100 where j is pure water flux l m 2 h v is the permeate volume l a is surface area m2 and t is time measurement h concentration of permeate cp and retention cr was measured using uv vis spectrophotometer with the absorption at 203 5 nm determination of the anti fouling properties of the membrane was conducted at the last stage by measuring the flux recovery ratio frr after performing steps one and two the membrane was washed with tap water the membrane was mounted on a stirred cell and the feed was filled with distilled water the apparatus was operated by activating stirring without being pressured for 15 min to release the remaining humic acid deposited on the membrane surface afterward the feed was discarded and replaced with new distilled water the permeate was collected and the flux j2 the membrane frr was then determined by eq 5 5 f r r j 2 j 1 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction of cellulose from opefb micro crystalline and nano crystalline cellulose were extracted from opefb waste through several steps as shown in fig 1 a opefb as raw material was alkalized using sodium hydroxide bleached using sodium hypochlorite and hydrolyzed using h2so4 the process produces a microcrystalline cellulose extract further treatment by ultrasonically dispersing mcc with the addition of sulfuric acid was able to transform mcc into ncc this is supported by several characterizations such as ftir and psa fig 1 b shows the atr ftir spectra of mcc and ncc it is clear that the typical absorption intensity of carbonyl which is usually found in opefb is not found in both materials which indicates that the cellulose was extracted successfully the most striking difference between the two mcc and ncc spectra is that there is a shift in the wave number of the o h vibration and the sharper c o c absorption found in the ncc the mcc sample had a particle size of 175 5 nm while the ncc sample had a particle size of 53 1 nm the decrease in particle size is caused by the process of breaking the bonds of the cellulose polymer into smaller fragments due to hydrolysis by sulfuric acid assisted by ultrasonic waves csiszar et al 2021 mazela et al 2020 3 2 fabrication of pvdf cellulose membranes pvdf cellulose membrane was fabricated using the phase inversion method fig 2 a shows the stages of membrane fabrication starting with the dispersion of mcc or ncc in dmac next the membrane was imprinted in a coagulant bath the initial characterization of the membrane was to identify the functional groups present in the membrane using atr ftir fig 2 b shows the atr ftir spectra of the pvdf pmc and pnc membranes absorption at 3030 and 2980 cm 1 indicates symmetrical and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the c h group the absorption at 1401 1177 and 1067 cm 1 is the deformation vibration of the c f group when compared with pure pvdf pvdf membrane containing cellulose has an absorption in the wave number region of 3332 cm 1 which indicates the o h vibration of the cellulose from the atr ftir analysis it can also be calculated the value of the beta fraction of pvdf after the addition of cellulose fig 2 c shows that the value of the beta fraction increases with the addition of mcc and ncc this indicates that the presence of cellulose as a filler is able to orient the pvdf polymer structure to a more polar β phase pvdf fig 3 shows the tga curves of pvdf pristine and pvdf cellulose membranes the presence of cellulose in the pvdf membrane initiates degradation since the beginning of combustion caused by the presence of water evaporated content bound to the cellulose the degradation of the pvdf polymer matrix occurs in the temperature range of 440 720 c with two stages of degradation the initiation of degradation in stage one occurred at a temperature of about 440 c which was applied to the pvdf membrane without cellulose modification the temperature of the first stage of degradation has increased in the modified cellulose membrane the highest temperature increase was achieved for the addition of 0 5 ncc and 1 mcc to 460 c the increase in degradation temperature was caused by the intermolecular interaction of the cellulose polymer on the pvdf matrix meanwhile the second stage of degradation occurred at relatively the same temperature namely in the range of 520 720 c the presence of intermolecular cellulose interactions in the membrane matrix slows down the degradation process this also lead by the presence of long chain crystalline and amorphous region of cellulose which contribute to improve the thermal stability of the membranes poletto et al 2014 from the data it was found that the pristine membrane burned out at a temperature of 680 c while the modified cellulose membrane was reached at a higher temperature 3 3 hydrophilicity and porosity of the membranes several tests were carried out to determine the surface properties of the membrane both pvdf membranes and modified products with cellulose to support their performance in the filtration process analyzing of surface properties is carried out by measuring the water contact angle of the membrane surfaces the water contact angle of the mcc and ncc modified pvdf membrane is shown in fig 4 a the data reveals that the entire membrane resulting from the phase inversion produces relatively hydrophilic properties as indicated by the value of the water contact angle which is smaller than 90 the addition of mcc and ncc resulted in a smaller contact angle than the unmodified membrane this indicates that the resulting membrane is more hydrophilic the increase in hydrophilicity is in line with the expectations of this study because a higher hydrophilicity membrane has the potential to provide better anti fouling properties further tests were carried out to determine the porosity of the membrane using the gravimetric method the membrane porosity data are shown in fig 4 b the results showed that the addition of cellulose in the pvdf membrane decreased the porosity of the membrane the addition of 0 5 wt cellulose in the dope solution resulted in a smaller porosity than 1 wt this is possible in the process of phase inversion and compaction of the membrane the process of filling the cavity in the membrane occurs so that the total pores in the cross section of the membrane decrease so that the porosity of the membrane becomes smaller the hydrophilic nature of hydroxyl group on cellulose polymer induce the phase transfer rate during the membrane formation the increasing of cellulose concentration lead repulsion effect of hydrophilic hydrophobic toward pvdf causing and improvement of porosity jin et al 2019 lv et al 2018 ma et al 2017 3 4 pure water flux analysis preliminary testing of membrane performance is carried out by measuring the permeability to pure water or without additives the permeability or pure water flux data are shown in fig 5 the data shows that the addition of cellulose to the pvdf membrane increases the pure water flux the average pure water flux from the pvdf membrane without modification was around 16 76 l m 2 h 1 and the highest value was obtained for the addition of 1 w w ncc which was 31 22 l m 2 h 1 the addition of cellulose to the membrane was able to increase the water flux by almost 100 and this showed a fairly good performance the membranes flux value was influenced by boththe hydrophilicity and porosity of the membrane higher hydrophilicity makes it easier for the membrane to interact with water and water permeation will be faster too so the water flux will be greater ma et al 2017 y wang et al 2021 in addition the presence of membrane porosity also plays a vital role in determining the membrane pure water flux value 3 5 analysis of membrane performance toward filtration of humic acid analysis of membrane filtration performance was carried out in 100 mg l 1 humic acid solution humic acid is a natural organic substance that is often a contaminant in groundwater and tap water rivers the membrane filtration performance against humic acid was determined from the value of the water flux and the percentage of humic acid rejection which the measurement results are shown in fig 6 the data shows that the addition of cellulose to the pvdf membrane increases the water flux as in the measurement of pure water flux the presence of cellulose in the membrane matrix increases the hydrophilicity of the membrane and has an impact on the ease of permeation of water into the membrane structure the rejection percentage of pvdf and polyblend pvdf cellulose mcc and ncc membranes showed a fairly good performance which resulted in a rejection percentage of above 90 the presence of cellulose in the membrane can increase the percentage of rejection or selectivity of the membrane the rejection value of the pvdf membrane without modification was 96 while the modified mcc membrane experienced an increase in the rejection value up to 98 and 99 at the addition of 0 5 and 1 w w respectively the addition of ncc to the pvdf membrane also resulted in an increase in the rejection ability of the membrane reaching 98 the problem that often arises in the use of hydrophobic polymers as filtration membranes is the occurrence of fouling on the membrane surface modification of the membrane that aims to increase the hydrophilicity of the surface is considered effective to overcome the problem of fouling in this study the addition of cellulose to the pvdf membrane was able to increase the hydrophilicity of the membrane and this also had an impact on its anti fouling properties the anti fouling properties of the membrane were determined by measuring the flux recovery ratio frr which is shown in fig 7 the frr of unmodified pvdf membrane was 86 and increased after the membrane was modified with cellulose the frr value of the modified membrane was able to produce frr 90 and the highest value was obtained at the addition of 1 mcc which was 96 this frr data is in line with the hydrophilicity of the membrane which was confirmed from the water contact angle data the relatively hydrophilic surface is able to reduce the interaction and accumulation of humic acid particles on the membrane surface hebbar et al 2018 thus humic acid molecules are more easily released in the washing process which also has an impact on the water flux value which is still high from the membrane performance test it can be seen that the modified pvdf with cellulose has the potential as a filtration membrane as indicated by high water flux rejection percentage 90 and good frr comparison of the membrane performance including rejection and frr of humic acid was depicted in table 2 the study shows that our result is comparable with other findings for example pmc1 has rejection of humic acid by 99 which is higher than previous study which involved metal oxide or grafting polymer technique to the pvdf membrane moreover the frr value of pmc1 reached 96 higher than pvdf sulfonated go sri abirami saraswathi et al 2020 or pvdf peg tio2 younas et al 2017 the result indicates that the pmc1 membrane is highly potential to be applied in water containing humic acid purification 3 6 analysis of membrane surface and cross section based on membrane performance analysis it was found that pmc1 membrane has better performance than other membranes thus for further analysis of membrane morphology pvdf and pmc1 membranes were selected fig 8 shows sem images of the surface and cross section of the membrane no significant differences were observed in both the surface morphology of the pvdf and pmc1 membranes however the cross sectional observations shown in fig 8 c and d indicate that the membrane in general consists of three areas namely the surface area finger like and sponge like the pvdf membrane has a relatively straight and wide finger like structure compared to the pmc1 membrane however the thickness of the finger like portion of the pmc1 membrane was greater than that of the pvdf membrane in addition the finger like structure of the pmc1 membrane is tortuous this is what affects the performance of the membrane where pmc1 membrane has a better performance than other membranes 4 conclusion cellulose extraction from opefb waste has been successfully carried out through the stages of alkalization bleaching and hydrolysis further treatment of mcc resulted in ncc with a particle size of about 53 1 nm both cellulose mcc and ncc were used as pvdf membrane fillers which were successfully fabricated using the phase inversion method the presence of cellulose in the pvdf membrane can increase the beta fraction of pvdf pnc1 beta fraction 0 6 as a result the hydrophilicity of the membrane containing cellulose is increasing as evidenced by the measurement of the water contact angle which is smaller than 90 in addition cellulose is also able to reduce the porosity of the membrane from 92 pvdf to 63 pnc0 5 which can support the performance of the membrane the results of pure water flux measurements showed that the presence of cellulose for example 1 of ncc increased water permeability to be 31 22 l m 2 h 1 due to an increase in hydrophilicity the membrane performance test using the humic acid model showed that the cellulose modified pvdf membrane had a rejection percentage exceeding 90 frr analysis showed that the pvdf membrane containing 1 mcc pmc1 had better performance than other membranes which was supported by both surface and cross sectional morphology observations accordingly this membrane showed its highly potential to be used for treating water containing organic pollutants therefore the real river or industrial water sample

substance one of which is membrane technology in this present study we have successfully fabricated pvdf and pvdf cellulose membranes through phase inversion method the cellulose extracted from oil palm empty fruit bunches was in two different dimension namely microcrystalline mcc and nanocrystalline cellulose ncc the physicochemical properties of the membrane were evaluated in this study it was found that the hydrophilicity of the membrane was elevated by the presence of cellulose filler this also led to reduce the porosity of the membrane but on the other hand increase the pure water flux the study revealed that by incorporating 1 of mcc pmc1 improved the rejection performance toward ha above 90 in addition pmc1 membrane has a higher flux recovery ratio frr value than other membranes thus for further applications especially in water treatment pmc1 membranes are highly recommended graphical abstract image 1 keywords cellulose pvdf humic acid membrane technology water treatment 1 introduction during the dry season peatland fires occur in indonesia especially in sumatra island which contribute significantly to the water pollution caused by the presence of water soluble organic matter wsom such as humic like substance fujii et al 2021 although humic acid ha is a non toxic organic compound which naturally occurring in soil this compound could decrease the quality of drinking water owing to its unpleasant taste odor and color rajaei et al 2021 sutzkover gutman et al 2010 moreover this compound becomes hazardous mater on the chlorinated water due to the production of disinfectant by products dbps limiting amount of dissolved oxygen in aquatic environment islam et al 2020 in addition ha also initiates pipeline fouling during the drinking water production therefore

used as microfiltration and ultrafiltration membrane due to its excellent chemical resistance good mechanical properties high thermal stability and easy to fabricate kang et al 2014 lv et al 2018 ma et al 2017 teow et al 2020 however the hydrophobic polymer backbone of pvdf leads a fouling on the membrane surfaces which increase the operation cost and shorten the life span of the membrane kang et al 2014 liu et al 2011 in recent study modifications of pvdf membrane have been carried out one of which by adding hydrophilic polymer as membrane filler kang et al 2014 lv et al 2018 ma et al 2017 teow et al 2020 hydroxyl groups of hydrophilic polymers could increase hydrophilicity of pvdf membrane that could decreases the fouling effect ma et al 2017 y wang et al 2021 cellulose c6h10o5 n is

pujiasih et al has been successfully isolated cellulose from opefb through alkalization bleaching and hydrolysis process many works reported that the pvdf membranes reinforced cellulose has good performance like high flux low contact angle high porosity and great rejection lotfikatouli et al 2021 lv et al 2018 ma et al 2017 teow et al 2020 y wang et al 2021 cellulose also improves the antifouling properties of pvdf membranes which could prolong life span of the membrane unfortunately the effect of cellulose dimension and size is not mentioned in previous studies nevertheless the particle size of the filler also affects the properties and performance of the membrane kang et al 2016 song et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to study the effect of particle size of cellulose fiber toward the properties of resulted pvdf cellulose composite this study performed an extraction of cellulose from opefb with two different dimension size namely microcrystalline and nanocrystalline cellulose both of cellulose were used as filler on pvdf membrane and evaluate their performance on the physical properties and separation ability toward ha sample 2 experimental 2 1 materials oil palm empty fruit bunch was obtained from indonesian palm oil plantation in kalimantan polyvinylidene fluoride solef pvdf was purchased from solvay with molecular weight 300 kda n n dimethylacetamide dmac merck sodium hypochlorite bratachem sodium hydroxide merck sulfuric acid merck were other chemicals used in this research 2 2 extraction of micro and nano cellulose from oil palm empty fruit bunches the cellulose extraction procedure was followed our previous work saputra et al 2021 the pretreated of opefb by alkalization and bleaching reagent was further hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid 45 for 45 min at 45 c to acquire mcc the ncc was obtained by treating of mcc with 10 h2so4 via ultrasonication method the ncc product was washed until reaching neutral ph and dried using freeze drying machine 2 3 fabrication of pvdf cellulose membranes fabrication membrane using phase inversion following our previous work pramono et al 2019 the cellulose mcc or ncc was dispersed in dmac for 10 min afterward peg400 and pvdf were subsequently added into the suspension and stirred for 24 h at 60 c the dope solution was casted on glass plate and immersed in water coagulant bath the membrane was collected and stored in glycerin solution for further analysis the composition of each components on preparation of the membranes is shown in table 1 2 4 characterization the membranes were characterized using following instruments and methods such as atr ftir sem water contact angle and porosity measurement the functional group of the sample was analyzed using atr ftir in addition the polymorph α and β phases in pvdf were also identified using this instrument which recorded from 500 to 4000 cm 1 the β phases faction f β was calculated using eq 1 1 f β a β 1 26 a α a β aα and aβ are the absorption peak of α and β phases at 763 cm 1 and 840 cm 1 respectively water contact angle was measured to evaluate hydrophilicity properties of membrane by dropping water on the membrane surfaces the image was captured with super macro camera and analyzed with imagej software membrane porosity was measured with gravimetric method the membranes were immersed in water and wiped carefully to remove the excess water the membrane wet weight wwet and thickness l were measured afterward then membranes were dried in oven at 60 c for 24 h the dry membrane was weighted wdry and thickness ldry of dry membranes was measured the membrane porosity was calculated using eq 2 floros et al 2020 2 ε w w e t w d r y a l d r y ρ cross section and top view of surface membranes were investigated by using sem the membrane was immersed in liquid nitrogen and further fractured immediately 2 5 study of membrane performances the membrane performance was analyzed in three stages namely the determination of pure water flux rejection and anti fouling frr determination of pure water flux was carried out by installing a membrane sample with a diameter of 5 cm in a stirred cell with a dead end system the stirred cell was filled with distilled water as feed and compaction was conducted for 15 min at a pressure of 2 bar then the permeate was collected and the water flux denoted as j1 was determined by eq 3 rejection of the membrane was performed in the next stage by changing the feed using a 100 mg l 1 humic acid solution and compacting again for 15 min the membrane rejection is determined by eq 4 3 j v a t 4 r 1 c p c r 100 where j is pure water flux l m 2 h v is the permeate volume l a is surface area m2 and t is time measurement h concentration of permeate cp and retention cr was measured using uv vis spectrophotometer with the absorption at 203 5 nm determination of the anti fouling properties of the membrane was conducted at the last stage by measuring the flux recovery ratio frr after performing steps one and two the membrane was washed with tap water the membrane was mounted on a stirred cell and the feed was filled with distilled water the apparatus was operated by activating stirring without being pressured for 15 min to release the remaining humic acid deposited on the membrane surface afterward the feed was discarded and replaced with new distilled water the permeate was collected and the flux j2 the membrane frr was then determined by eq 5 5 f r r j 2 j 1 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction of cellulose from opefb micro crystalline and nano crystalline cellulose were extracted from opefb waste through several steps as shown in fig 1 a opefb as raw material was alkalized using sodium hydroxide bleached using sodium hypochlorite and hydrolyzed using h2so4 the process produces a microcrystalline cellulose extract further treatment by ultrasonically dispersing mcc with the addition of sulfuric acid was able to transform mcc into ncc this is supported by several characterizations such as ftir and psa fig 1 b shows the atr ftir spectra of mcc and ncc it is clear that the typical absorption intensity of carbonyl which is usually found in opefb is not found in both materials which indicates that the cellulose was extracted successfully the most striking difference between the two mcc and ncc spectra is that there is a shift in the wave number of the o h vibration and the sharper c o c absorption found in the ncc the mcc sample had a particle size of 175 5 nm while the ncc sample had a particle size of 53 1 nm the decrease in particle size is caused by the process of breaking the bonds of the cellulose polymer into smaller fragments due to hydrolysis by sulfuric acid assisted by ultrasonic waves csiszar et al 2021 mazela et al 2020 3 2 fabrication of pvdf cellulose membranes pvdf cellulose membrane was fabricated using the phase inversion method fig 2 a shows the stages of membrane fabrication starting with the dispersion of mcc or ncc in dmac next the membrane was imprinted in a coagulant bath the initial characterization of the membrane was to identify the functional groups present in the membrane using atr ftir fig 2 b shows the atr ftir spectra of the pvdf pmc and pnc membranes absorption at 3030 and 2980 cm 1 indicates symmetrical and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the c h group the absorption at 1401 1177 and 1067 cm 1 is the deformation vibration of the c f group when compared with pure pvdf pvdf membrane containing cellulose has an absorption in the wave number region of 3332 cm 1 which indicates the o h vibration of the cellulose from the atr ftir analysis it can also be calculated the value of the beta fraction of pvdf after the addition of cellulose fig 2 c shows that the value of the beta fraction increases with the addition of mcc and ncc this indicates that the presence of cellulose as a filler is able to orient the pvdf polymer structure to a more polar β phase pvdf fig 3 shows the tga curves of pvdf pristine and pvdf cellulose membranes the presence of cellulose in the pvdf membrane initiates degradation since the beginning of combustion caused by the presence of water evaporated content bound to the cellulose the degradation of the pvdf polymer matrix occurs in the temperature range of 440 720 c with two stages of degradation the initiation of degradation in stage one occurred at a temperature of about 440 c which was applied to the pvdf membrane without cellulose modification the temperature of the first stage of degradation has increased in the modified cellulose membrane the highest temperature increase was achieved for the addition of 0 5 ncc and 1 mcc to 460 c the increase in degradation temperature was caused by the intermolecular interaction of the cellulose polymer on the pvdf matrix meanwhile the second stage of degradation occurred at relatively the same temperature namely in the range of 520 720 c the presence of intermolecular cellulose interactions in the membrane matrix slows down the degradation process this also lead by the presence of long chain crystalline and amorphous region of cellulose which contribute to improve the thermal stability of the membranes poletto et al 2014 from the data it was found that the pristine membrane burned out at a temperature of 680 c while the modified cellulose membrane was reached at a higher temperature 3 3 hydrophilicity and porosity of the membranes several tests were carried out to determine the surface properties of the membrane both pvdf membranes and modified products with cellulose to support their performance in the filtration process analyzing of surface properties is carried out by measuring the water contact angle of the membrane surfaces the water contact angle of the mcc and ncc modified pvdf membrane is shown in fig 4 a the data reveals that the entire membrane resulting from the phase inversion produces relatively hydrophilic properties as indicated by the value of the water contact angle which is smaller than 90 the addition of mcc and ncc resulted in a smaller contact angle than the unmodified membrane this indicates that the resulting membrane is more hydrophilic the increase in hydrophilicity is in line with the expectations of this study because a higher hydrophilicity membrane has the potential to provide better anti fouling properties further tests were carried out to determine the porosity of the membrane using the gravimetric method the membrane porosity data are shown in fig 4 b the results showed that the addition of cellulose in the pvdf membrane decreased the porosity of the membrane the addition of 0 5 wt cellulose in the dope solution resulted in a smaller porosity than 1 wt this is possible in the process of phase inversion and compaction of the membrane the process of filling the cavity in the membrane occurs so that the total pores in the cross section of the membrane decrease so that the porosity of the membrane becomes smaller the hydrophilic nature of hydroxyl group on cellulose polymer induce the phase transfer rate during the membrane formation the increasing of cellulose concentration lead repulsion effect of hydrophilic hydrophobic toward pvdf causing and improvement of porosity jin et al 2019 lv et al 2018 ma et al 2017 3 4 pure water flux analysis preliminary testing of membrane performance is carried out by measuring the permeability to pure water or without additives the permeability or pure water flux data are shown in fig 5 the data shows that the addition of cellulose to the pvdf membrane increases the pure water flux the average pure water flux from the pvdf membrane without modification was around 16 76 l m 2 h 1 and the highest value was obtained for the addition of 1 w w ncc which was 31 22 l m 2 h 1 the addition of cellulose to the membrane was able to increase the water flux by almost 100 and this showed a fairly good performance the membranes flux value was influenced by boththe hydrophilicity and porosity of the membrane higher hydrophilicity makes it easier for the membrane to interact with water and water permeation will be faster too so the water flux will be greater ma et al 2017 y wang et al 2021 in addition the presence of membrane porosity also plays a vital role in determining the membrane pure water flux value 3 5 analysis of membrane performance toward filtration of humic acid analysis of membrane filtration performance was carried out in 100 mg l 1 humic acid solution humic acid is a natural organic substance that is often a contaminant in groundwater and tap water rivers the membrane filtration performance against humic acid was determined from the value of the water flux and the percentage of humic acid rejection which the measurement results are shown in fig 6 the data shows that the addition of cellulose to the pvdf membrane increases the water flux as in the measurement of pure water flux the presence of cellulose in the membrane matrix increases the hydrophilicity of the membrane and has an impact on the ease of permeation of water into the membrane structure the rejection percentage of pvdf and polyblend pvdf cellulose mcc and ncc membranes showed a fairly good performance which resulted in a rejection percentage of above 90 the presence of cellulose in the membrane can increase the percentage of rejection or selectivity of the membrane the rejection value of the pvdf membrane without modification was 96 while the modified mcc membrane experienced an increase in the rejection value up to 98 and 99 at the addition of 0 5 and 1 w w respectively the addition of ncc to the pvdf membrane also resulted in an increase in the rejection ability of the membrane reaching 98 the problem that often arises in the use of hydrophobic polymers as filtration membranes is the occurrence of fouling on the membrane surface modification of the membrane that aims to increase the hydrophilicity of the surface is considered effective to overcome the problem of fouling in this study the addition of cellulose to the pvdf membrane was able to increase the hydrophilicity of the membrane and this also had an impact on its anti fouling properties the anti fouling properties of the membrane were determined by measuring the flux recovery ratio frr which is shown in fig 7 the frr of unmodified pvdf membrane was 86 and increased after the membrane was modified with cellulose the frr value of the modified membrane was able to produce frr 90 and the highest value was obtained at the addition of 1 mcc which was 96 this frr data is in line with the hydrophilicity of the membrane which was confirmed from the water contact angle data the relatively hydrophilic surface is able to reduce the interaction and accumulation of humic acid particles on the membrane surface hebbar et al 2018 thus humic acid molecules are more easily released in the washing process which also has an impact on the water flux value which is still high from the membrane performance test it can be seen that the modified pvdf with cellulose has the potential as a filtration membrane as indicated by high water flux rejection percentage 90 and good frr comparison of the membrane performance including rejection and frr of humic acid was depicted in table 2 the study shows that our result is comparable with other findings for example pmc1 has rejection of humic acid by 99 which is higher than previous study which involved metal oxide or grafting polymer technique to the pvdf membrane moreover the frr value of pmc1 reached 96 higher than pvdf sulfonated go sri abirami saraswathi et al 2020 or pvdf peg tio2 younas et al 2017 the result indicates that the pmc1 membrane is highly potential to be applied in water containing humic acid purification 3 6 analysis of membrane surface and cross section based on membrane performance analysis it was found that pmc1 membrane has better performance than other membranes thus for further analysis of membrane morphology pvdf and pmc1 membranes were selected fig 8 shows sem images of the surface and cross section of the membrane no significant differences were observed in both the surface morphology of the pvdf and pmc1 membranes however the cross sectional observations shown in fig 8 c and d indicate that the membrane in general consists of three areas namely the surface area finger like and sponge like the pvdf membrane has a relatively straight and wide finger like structure compared to the pmc1 membrane however the thickness of the finger like portion of the pmc1 membrane was greater than that of the pvdf membrane in addition the finger like structure of the pmc1 membrane is tortuous this is what affects the performance of the membrane where pmc1 membrane has a better performance than other membranes 4 conclusion cellulose extraction from opefb waste has been successfully carried out through the stages of alkalization bleaching and hydrolysis further treatment of mcc resulted in ncc with a particle size of about 53 1 nm both cellulose mcc and ncc were used as pvdf membrane fillers which were successfully fabricated using the phase inversion method the presence of cellulose in the pvdf membrane can increase the beta fraction of pvdf pnc1 beta fraction 0 6 as a result the hydrophilicity of the membrane containing cellulose is increasing as evidenced by the measurement of the water contact angle which is smaller than 90 in addition cellulose is also able to reduce the porosity of the membrane from 92 pvdf to 63 pnc0 5 which can support the performance of the membrane the results of pure water flux measurements showed that the presence of cellulose for example 1 of ncc increased water permeability to be 31 22 l m 2 h 1 due to an increase in hydrophilicity the membrane performance test using the humic acid model showed that the cellulose modified pvdf membrane had a rejection percentage exceeding 90 frr analysis showed that the pvdf membrane containing 1 mcc pmc1 had better performance than other membranes which was supported by both surface and cross sectional morphology observations accordingly this membrane showed its highly potential to be used for treating water containing organic pollutants therefore the real river or industrial water sample

11838,the afram plains watershed is one of the major watersheds located at the lower part of the volta basin in ghana with high groundwater usage dependency on groundwater is a fast growing concern in the plains due to the unreliable supply of surface water this has put the groundwater resources under intense pressure and has necessitated the need for sustainable management of the groundwater resources this study aimed to estimate the recharge spatial distribution and potential recharge zones of groundwater at different scales in the afram plains area using the soil and water assessment tool swat model and geography information system gis approach the swat model was set up 1983 2016 calibrated 1983 1990 and validated 1991 1997 using digital elevation model soil land use climate datasets and discharge data the gis approach was used to produce thematic maps for eight contributing factors rainfall elevation land cover land use lineaments drainage geology soil and slope for mapping the recharge zones the results showed that about 1 65 19 3 mm of the swat simulated mean annual rainfall 1176 9 mm is converted into groundwater recharge in the watershed the potential recharge zones categorized as very poor poor moderate and high zones have area coverages of 0 58 20 8 km2 22 4 798 km2 60 9 2169 km2 and 16 2 576 km2 respectively the potential recharge zones after validation over boreholes and wells data indicated that the afram plains area is dominated by the moderate potential zone graphical abstract image 1 keywords swat groundwater groundwater potential

aquifer s as well as the informative trend of the replenishment of the aquifers remote sensing techniques can enable the estimation of the potential recharge zones to unequivocally achieve the united nation s sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 the use of advanced techniques are required to intensify research in the water sector however plausible impacts of land use and climate change may pose a threat to the recharge of groundwater groundwater recharge depletion is one of the current challenges facing majority of aquifers throughout the world however the battle to meet the increasing water demands has compelled many cities and communities all over the world to use groundwater to complement demand the dependency of the people living around the afram plains on groundwater is a fast growing concern in the plains where hydrogeological dynamics of the terrain has not been well studied the available source of water supply to the inhabitants of the afram plains area is centered on groundwater the sustainability of the groundwater resource in the afram plains is dwindling as over abstraction supervenes recharge however the afram plains area has been recognized as one of the poorest districts in ghana of which agriculture is its main economic activity the plains also lost physical access to the other parts of the country making it a peninsula district yidana and ophori 2008 the high competition among water users in the plains for domestic use farming and livestock is an issue that has to be investigated using groundwater modelling tools such modelling endeavours can characterize the groundwater conditions such as potential recharge zones and recharge rates in the watershed of the afram plains area however proper recharge estimation modellings are useful elements for groundwater management data scarcity has been a major limitation to conduct groundwater recharge modelling in ghana which constrained several experts to develop models for proper groundwater

this research is to estimate the groundwater recharge and the potential recharge zones in the afram plains area of ghana using swat and remote sensing techniques this would serve as a framework for monitoring and management of groundwater in the afram plains area 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the afram plains area is located in the lower volta river basin in the eastern region of ghana it is sited between latitude 6 6080 and 7 1300 n and longitude 0 0542 and 0 4926 e fig 1 the afram plains area has a geographical area of 5446 km2 as the largest district in the region with an undulating land surface ranging between 60 and 120 m above mean sea level the area is bounded to the north by the obosum river to the east by the volta lake and the south west and south by the afram river agyare et al 2017 the average annual rainfall in the afram plains area ranges between 1150 and 1650 mm however the highest rainfall ever recorded in the afram plains area occurred in 1986 with an annual maximum depth of 1832 mm and a minimum depth of 546 mm which also occurred in 1987 agyare et al 2017 wet season in the afram plains area starts from april to october and dry season from november to late march some water demands are met during the wettest rainy period from may to september the climate within the year traverses between warm and hot with annual mean temperatures of about 36 6 36 8 c which generally peaks up around february to late march before the start of the rainfall season relative humidity is generally between 70 and 80 throughout the year agyare et al 2017 the transitional savannah forest has been recently dominated by grasses due to clearing of lands for activities such as farming cattle grazing and production of charcoal 2 2 soil types geology and hydrogeology the soil types found in the afram plains area are plinthosols fluvisols regosols lixisols luvisols and leptosols obuobie and barry 2010 lixisols are the most dominant soil type found in the area the afram plains area is predominantly overlain by late precambrian to ordovician aged sedimentary rocks belonging to the voltaian supergroup davies and cobbing 2002 locally rocks in the area are members of the upper middle voltaian beds of the obosum formation they are composed of sandstones shales siltstones and conglomerates majority of these rocks are tectonically stable except those exposed along the eastern fringe of the voltaian supergroup which have been affected by n s striking folds davies and cobbing 2002 however at a few kilometers away from this zone of folding the sediments appear to be flat lying showing no intrusive suites with a few large faults the sandstones and conglomerates around the east west fringe of the area are capped by well drained sandy soils whereas the well cemented feldspathic sandstones at the western domain are capped by ferricrete duricrust davies and cobbing 2002 also the basal shales outcropping at the southern peripheral are overlain by thick poorly drained clayey soils the aquifer systems are characterized by semi confined aquifers with low permeability and secondary permeability within fractured zones acheampong and hess 1998 davies and cobbing 2002 the lithology of the southern voltaian aquifers is grouped into five divisional rock regions fig 2 c which include feldspathic sandstone siltstone arkose and mudstone fractured shale and grey sandstone sandstone and massive conglomerate quartzitic sandstone and conglomerate and unfractured shale and sandstone acheampong and hess 1998 davies and cobbing 2002 this indicates that shale mudstone sandstone conglomerate siltstone and limestone are the main rock units within aquifers of the afram plains area the aquifer of the southeastern division consists of fractured shale and grey sandstone fig 2c due to low permeabilities in this division the groundwater potential varies between poor and moderate with drilling depth of boreholes between 50 and 100 m the success rate of drilling is about 50 yidana and ophori 2008 the water in this region is saline and not preferable for many purposes in the area the central division of the rocks region consists of quartzitic sandstones and conglomerates aquifer properties are based on fracturing and weathering of these rocks with the success rate of drilling a wet well reaching about 50 with a good groundwater quality for many domestic purposes borehole depths are characterized by an average of 55 m with yields of 10 960 l min the static water levels of boreholes in the area range from 1 to 20 m and the aquifers have transmissivities in the range of 1 71 6 m2 day acheampong and hess 1998 the southwestern division composes of unfractured shale and sandstone with poorly defined hydrogeological properties in the area fig 2c and d in the sandstone and massive conglomerate division groundwater basically occurs within the fractured and weathered areas with about 66 of drilling projects in the division prolific aquifers identified in the feldspathic sandstone siltstone arkose and mudstone division aquifers are characterized by high degrees of deep fracture systems and weathering with approximately 66 borehole drilling success rate yidana and ophori 2008 according to acheampong and hess 1998 groundwater recharge in the afram plains area is centered within the mid section of the area due to the undulating topography of the area there seems to be a hydraulic connection between surface water and groundwater resources in the area where surface water bodies are recharging and feeding the groundwater aquifers fig 2d but this needs detailed hydrogeological investigation to confirm it 3 materials and methods 3 1 spatial data the spatial datasets used to setup the swat model for the watershed included digital elevation model dem soil and land use land cover shuttle radar topographic mission digital elevation model was downloaded from the consultative group on international agricultural research consortium for spatial information cgiar csi 2018 with 30 m 30 m resolution the land use land cover and the soil data were obtained from landsat image

satellite imagery with 30 30 m resolution supervised classification using the spectral angle mapper sam algorithm in envi 5 3 was used to classify the images after spectral signatures of the various classes were generated six classes were developed they were based on the ghana land use and land cover classification scheme for visual classification of remote sensing data öztekin et al 2008 the afram plains soil and geological maps were extracted from the soil and geological maps of ghana and converted from polygon to raster using the conversion tool in the arcgis interface these maps were reclassified a weight of 12 0 12 was assigned to the reclassified soil raster map luvisols and lixisols soils dominate the soil formation in the afram plains area fig 2b 3 2 meteorological and discharge datasets climatic datasets were obtained from the ghana meteorological agency gmet the data included solar radiation temperature relative humidity precipitation and wind speed to augment the limited spatial distribution of the stations datasets for the simulation 24 gridded data for all the five parameters were obtained from the global weather data for period 1979 2014 globalweather tamu edu the missing or skipped station data were filled with 99 0 the value 99 0 tells swat weather generator to compute values to replace the missing data gaps during the simulation time daily discharge data for the period 1983 1997 was collected from the hydrological service department hsd 3 3 hydrological modelling using the swat model 3 3 1 swat model setup the steps of the swat model setup for the afram plains watershed fig 3 was performed by following the stepwise procedures outlined in the swat user manual and by various researchers e g arnold et al 2012a b dile et al 2016 abbaspour et al 2017 the dem was used to delineate the slopes and the watershed into 61 sub basins in the qswat interface three slope classes were used in the watershed creation 0 5 5 8 and 8 999 hydrological response units hrus were created using multiple hru option by land use slope and soil in all 61 hrus were created with a defined slope land and soil threshold of 10 the model was simulated for 17 years 1980 1997 with 3 years as model warm up period dile and srinivasan 2014 dile et al 2016 3 3 2 groundwater recharge simulation swat model simulation considers two types of aquifer systems shallow and deep aquifers at each hru arnold et al 1993 in swat shallow aquifer reaches a depth of about 2 20 m with deep aquifer above 20 m arnold et al 1993 arnold et al 2012a b this study considered groundwater recharge as the amount of water that occurs as a result of infiltration through percolation from the soil profile and it is calculated by swat as 1 w rchg j 1 exp 1 δ gw w seep exp 1 δ gw w rch g i 1 where w r c h g i 1 and w r c h g i are the amount of water recharging the aquifer on day i 1 mm and i mm whereas w s e e p and δ g w are the amount of water from the soil profile entering the vadose zone and the time of delay or drainage time in days respectively w r c h g is the total amount of water recharge neitsch et al 2005 the amount of recharge partition that enters into shallow and deep aquifers are simulated in the swat model using the following equations 2 w rcg sh w rchg d p rech 3 d p rech β deep w rchg where w r c g s h is the amount recharge to shallow aquifer on a day i mm d p r e c h is the amount to recharge to the deep aquifer on a day i mm and β d e e p is the percolation coefficient of the aquifer neitsch et al 2005 3 3 3 calibration and evaluation of the model calibration and validation of the swat model parameters were based on manual and sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 algorithm dile et al 2016 using daily discharge data from aframso river gauge station for the period between 1983 and 1997 the model was calibrated and validated with the data from 1983 to 1990 and 1991 to 1997 respectively during the manual calibration of the swat model very few parameters were performed which included curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 alpha bf baseflow alpha factor and esco soil evaporation compensation factor during the sufi2 iterations simulation nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was also selected as an objective function with a behavioural threshold of 0 25 and 200 simulations per each iteration for the calibration of the parameters it is desirable that the model should reflect the biophysical conditions of the study area therefore the swat model performance was evaluated using these statistical methods nse coefficient of determination r2 and pbias nse is a statistical method that has been widely used for determining the magnitude of the simulated values as compared to the observed flow nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse

sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to evaluate the model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the swat model were carried out using sequence uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 algorithm in the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 2007 one at a time oat sensitivity method was used during the sufi2 iterations to scan the parameters of high sensitivity however the significance and high sensitivity parameters were assessed using the p values and t stat values respectively the larger the absolute value of the t stat the more sensitive the parameter whereas the p values were used to determine the significance of the sensitivity of the parameters and where the p value become close to zero the more significant the parameter khalida et al 2016 3 4 groundwater potential zones mapping in this study soil land use land cover slope rainfall elevation drainage density and lineament density were used as the input parameters for groundwater potential zones identification fig 4 these parameters characteristics control the recharge storage and movement of groundwater this method was in line with studies conducted by several researchers who considered similar inputs factors bhowmick and ojha 2019 kindie et al 2019 rani et al 2019 arnous et al 2020 berhanu and hatiye 2020 dar et al 2020 ouchar et al 2020 bhattacharya et al 2021 3 4 1 rainfall the daily rainfall data collected was converted into average annual rainfall which was used to generate the spatial distribution of rainfall using inverse weight distance iwd tool in the arcgis interface the rainfall map prepared was further classified into five classes of area coverage that is very low 40 72 low 21 46 moderate 32 17 high 4 98 and very high 0 67 fig 5 a a weight value of 14 0 14 was assigned to it siddi raju et al 2019 3 4 2 elevation the elevation of the study area was extracted from the elevation map of ghana in the arcgis environment the map created was categorized into four classes very low 50 100 m low 100 150 m moderate 150 200 m and high 200 250 m fig 5b a weight of 11 0 11 was assigned to the elevation map during groundwater potential zone calculation the study area is a plain and therefore high priority was given to the low elevation areas due to the influence on surface runoff infiltration thapa et al 2017 commented that plain areas are associated with low elevations which induces a longer retention period of surface runoff to cause high infiltration of recharge to groundwater 3 4 3 drainage density dd the drainage density of the watershed was generated from the srtm dem with 30 30 m resolution through arcgis interface using line density command the drainage density map was reclassified in five classes very low low moderate high and very high and assigned a weighted value of 11 0 11 fig 5c during the analytical hierarchy process ahp method 7 dd le a where le is the total length of all the rivers and streams and a is the total of the drainage basin or the watershed 3 4 4 slope the slope map was prepared from the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem 30 30 m resolution using slope command from the arcgis interface the slope of the study area was classified into five classes which varies in percentages from 0 to 27 and thus from very good to very poor fig 6 b weighted value of 11 0 11 to it during the ahp method the very good area is nearly flat due to the terrain nature of afram plains which influences more infiltration rates this was in line with a study conducted by chowdhury et al 2008 3 4 5 lineament density ld the srtm dem was used to extract the lineament networks using pci geomatica trial version lineament density km km2 map was then prepared in arcgis using the line density command the map was reclassified into five classes very poor 635 47 km2 poor 815 15 km2 moderate 1048 57 km2 high 1148 34 km2 whiles very high class covers 439 94 km2 fig 6a a weight of 12 0 12 was assigned to the raster map according to the ahp method for the calculation of groundwater potential zones low weight was assigned to low lineament density and high weight were assigned to the high lineaments due to the influence of infiltration by high lineaments 8 ld le a where le is the total length of all lineaments and a is the unit area 3 4 6 geological map the afram plains area s geological map was extracted from the geological map of ghana and converted from polygon to raster using the conversion tool in the arcgis interface this map was reclassified a weight of 18 0 18 was assigned to the reclassified geological raster map fig 6 c the geological setting of the study area is greatly dominated by mainly shale mudstone beds mainly sandy pebble beds followed by calcareous sands along the eastern border of the volta lake basaltic andesitic trachytic lava agglomerate tuff jasper were also found with the calcareous sands along the eastern border however mainly sandstones were also found in the south western corridor of the study area acheampong and hess 1998 davies and cobbing 2002 3 5 analytical hierarchy process and weighted overlay multi criteria analysis evaluation of analytical hierarchy process was employed das and mukhopadhyay 2018 argaz et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 the most influential thematic factors for groundwater potential zoning were examined and assigned weightage based on the hydrological prevailing conditions within the study area the assigned weights for each thematic map were used as inputs during the weighted overlay saaty s scale of 1 9 was used to rank the classes of the thematic maps saaty 1977 table 1 the classes which were deduced as equal important were assigned a value of 1 while the 9 was assigned to classes of extremely important to groundwater potential occurrence storage and movement for saaty s scale 1 to 9 of importance see saaty 1977 4 results and discussion 4 1 land use land cover the major land use land cover classes identified in the study area with their spatial distributions were bare land open spaces roads and rocks 1278 70 km2 with 24 of the total land coverage farmlands cropland fallow land and plantation 883 90 km2 with an area cover of 16 forest forest and forest plantation 1505 80 km2 constituted the most dominant land use land cover with an area of coverage 28 settlements urban and rural communities 58 79 km2 is the least class constituting 1 trees and shrubs 560 55 km2 10 and water bodies volta lake rivers and streams 1158 55 km2 also aggregated to 21 of the watershed fig 2a general observation depicted that the spatial distribution of the bare land and rocks and farmlands were observed within the central and along the volta lake and the afram river part of the afram plains area the forested areas were also dominant in the north western part of the plains settlements which constituted the urban and rural communities were also observed docketed all over the plains trees and shrubs were also dominant along the water bodies within the plains 4 2 swat model sensitivity calibration and uncertainty analysis a total of five parameters were chosen for the afram river simulations after performing sensitivity analysis table 2 the groundwater delay time gw delay was found to be the most sensitive parameter among the five parameters selected the gw delay t stat value was recorded at 3 6 with approximate differences of 0 53 and 2 08 for cn2 and esco parameters respectively the alpha bf and gwqwmin p values recorded showed less significance in the watershed modelling as compared to the most sensitivity parameters evaluating the monthly observed flow using the 95ppu in figs 7 and 8 provided the statistics for nse r factor and p factor in table 3 during the calibration period 1983 1990 the model recorded the p factor and r factor of 0 81 and 1 27 respectively the p factor and r factor obtained during the validation period were 0 75 and 1 21 respectively the per cent of observed data enveloped together by the 95ppu during both calibration and validation were 81 and 75 which were within the recommended acceptable performance of a model abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour 2015 the objective function statistical results showed that nse values were 0 89 and 0 80 for the calibration period 1983 1990 and the validation period 1991 1997 respectively the nse value saw an improvement during the sufi2 calibration of 0 09 0 89 as against 0 80 recorded during the swat model calibration a similar significant increase in calibration performed by sufi2 results were reported by koycegiz and buyuyildiz 2019 the nse values recorded were very good according to the recommended range by moriasi et al 2007 koycegiz and buyuyildiz 2019 and kwarteng et al 2020 the calibrated and validated r2 values obtained were 0 90 and 0 80 respectively according to mylevaganam et al 2015 high r2 values indicate fewer errors with the observed data with a recommended acceptable value of r2 0 5 the r2 values obtained in this study were very good the pbias was 0 7 in calibration and 3 1 in the validation the positive and negative pbias values indicated the model bias towards underestimation and overestimation respectively gupta et al 1999 the pbias value of 0 70 recorded for the streamflow calibration was within the very good range pbias 10 according to obuobie 2008 the swat model simulates low and high flows as underestimation and overestimation respectively the underestimation recorded in the calibration could be as a result of more water contributing to base flow from more than one shallow aquifer to the base flow of the adjacent streams within the study area watershed the results obtained for the pbias nse and r2 were very good and according to moriasi et al 2007 koycegiz and buyuyildiz 2019 and kwarteng et al 2020 table 4 the results of hydrological simulations are satisfactory pbias 25 nse 0 5 and r2 0 6 these statistics results show that the swat model was able to simulate the hydro biophysical parameters of the afram plains and therefore the model is considered for further hydrological studies in the watershed 4 3 mean monthly and annual distribution of swat simulated rainfall and recharge in fig 9 the simulated mean monthly 1983 1997 distribution of the hydrological components from the swat model simulation showed that throughout the year the highest mean monthly rainfalls were recorded in june 159 24 mm july 176 54 mm september 165 97 mm and october 163 40 mm the highest rainfall was found in july the groundwater recharge gw rchg was steady from late february through to may and after which it recorded sharp high peaks in july september and october it was further observed that the for monthly and annnual gw rchg increased as rainfall peaks and declines as rainfall recedes figs 9 and 10 analytically it is valid to mention that the rainfall in afram plains starts in april to october with about four to five months of the dry season which was also reported by agyare et al 2017 4 4 spatial distribution of groundwater recharge the spatial distribution of swat simulated rainfall and recharge at monthly scale over the afram plains watershed is shown in fig 11 according to fig 11a the spatial monthly mean rainfall values recorded range between 81 53 and 115 32 mm the distribution of the rainfall over the watershed showed that some communities within the northwest and southeastern part of the afram plains district experience high rainfall as compared to those closer to the volta lake fig 11a the analysis showed that the groundwater recharge gw rchg component of the spatial results ranged between less than 0 01 103 70 mm fig 11b it was further found out that the spatial results of the gw rchg distribution within the watershed were coinciding with the precipitation and the water yield values distributed over the watershed moreover the lower spatial gw rchg results observed in the northwestern were in line with davies and cobbing 2002 and yidana and ophori 2008 studies which showed that areas around maame krobo through kwasi fante is dominated by mudstone siltstone arkose and feldspathic sandstone are considered as a poor recharge zone with about as a result of the underlined cemented layer of 60 m deep furthermore the high recharge observed in northeastern found within the sandstone regions which include donkokrom somsei adiemmra kwasi kuma and abomosarefo according to yidana and ophori 2008 and agyare et al 2017 these areas experience moderate to high aquifer recharge with 66 successful rate of drilling of a wet well however the simulated reach flow out 15 results which corresponded to the observed data was found in the draw outlet 5th subbasin which is located at obosum river in the northern part of the afram plains watershed this confirms that a greater percentage of the surface runoffs were being discharged in the northern part of the watershed it is essential to determine the amount of rainfall distribution that goes into groundwater recharge the aquifer in afram plains is considered a semi confined aquifer system with a low primary permeability and secondary permeability around fractured zones acheampong and hess 1998 davies and cobbing 2002 therefore the simulation and calibration were defined based on aquifer behaviours and as well as observations the analysis of the average annual hydrological components simulated from the model baseline ran as the proportion of the precipitation over the watershed as shown in fig 12 this was in line with a study conducted to estimate groundwater recharge in the upper basin white volta basin by obuobie 2008 during the model simulation period it was observed that 66 57 of the mean annual rainfall 1176 90 mm was lost to the actual evapotranspiration in the watershed the water yield component comprises about 45 of the mean annual rainfall 530 69 mm of which lateral flow accounts for 0 19 while q surf and q gw account for 14 54 and 28 71 respectively the amount of the mean rainfall to the groundwater recharge w rchg in the watershed is about 32 85 386 64 mm of which 1 65 19 33 mm recharge the deep aquifer system the amount 32 85 to recharge groundwater w rchg comprises both deep and shallow aquifer recharge in the watershed neitsch et al 2005 2011 the swat model simulated the amount to the deep aquifer recharge as 1 65 19 33 mm this result obtained could have been validated with the aquifer percolation coefficient of the area in the watershed the simulated et of 66 57 rainfall as the highest value obtained is an indication that the highest water loss in the afram plains is dominated by et the seasonal growth of crops and vegetations can be attributed to the highest et value obtained the results observed from the various parameters is the representation of the relationship between the swat model hydrological components however these results obtained from the model were in line with various studies conducted in the upper part of the volta basin whereas afram plains are in the lower part of the basin martin 2006 obuobie 2008 4 5 groundwater potential zone and validation after the analytical hierarchy process and the weighted overly procedure the final groundwater potential zoning map fig 12 revealed four zones which include very poor poor moderate and high the total area without the volta lake water body of the groundwater potentials map produced is 3562 64 km2 the very poor and poor groundwater potential zone covered 0 58 and 22 39 of the study area respectively the moderate and the high groundwater potential zone cover about 60 87 and 16 16 of the study area respectively from fig 12 a significant amount of the very poor was observed concentrating at the center of the watershed with less scattered zones throughout the map the results showed that moderate groundwater potential areas are seen dominated the area however observations from the map fig 12 showed that the high groundwater potential areas coincided the very low and low drainage density flat areas of the slope map 1 57 5 10 and the nearly gentle flat areas of the elevation map ranging 50 100 m and as well as the very high lineament density areas areas of moderate groundwater potentials were also found in the slope per cent of 1 57 5 10 very low drainage density very high lineament density and elevation 50 150 m these observations consisted of studies conducted by other researchers manap et al 2011 rahmati et al 2014 further findings also revealed that the high rainfall areas coincided with the high groundwater potential areas moreover the central part of the plains is dominated by high elevations and slope experiences poor groundwater potentials the groundwater potential zones map was verified with 29 boreholes and hand dug wells yield data fashae et al 2013 argaz et al 2019 kindie et al 2019 the existing groundwater yield data of the boreholes and hand dug wells coordinates were superimposed on the groundwater potentials map showed that the very poor class of the groundwater potential zones recorded nil indicating that none of the hand dug wells or boreholes was found yielding water within those potentials areas out of the 29 boreholes and hand dug wells points superimposed on the map 10 34 50 matched with poor groundwater potentials zones 17 58 60 recorded in the moderate groundwater potential zones and 2 6 9 were also found within the high groundwater potentials zones the moderate groundwater potential zones recorded the highest number of yielding boreholes and hand dug wells in the study area this was in line with a study conducted by davies and cobbing 2002 according to davies and cobbing 2002 the north eastern and central part of the afram plains aquifer system groundwater potential is moderate whiles the southern and western part ranges from moderate to low the 58 60 of the number yielding boreholes and hand dug wells which matched the moderate groundwater potential class showed that the groundwater potential zones map and the boreholes and hand dug wells have a good correlation agreement this indicates that the groundwater potential is dominated by the moderate class it is therefore recommended that projects earmarked to drill more boreholes should be sited within the high potential zones for the communities within those zones however caution should be taken to avoid over abstraction 5 conclusions the fundamental focus of this research was to estimate groundwater recharge due to the immense pressure on groundwater as a result of insufficient surface water to meet demands for domestic and irrigation purposes in the afram plains area the following conclusions are drawn from the study the swat model estimated the mean monthly rainfall 1983 1997 to groundwater recharge w rchg to about 32 85 386 64 mm with 1 65 19 33 mm recharging the deep aquifer the mean monthly and annual swat simulations showed that the groundwater recharge increases as rainfall reaches its peak in the rainy seasons and decreases as rainfall subsides between late november and march the spatial results of the swat model showed a correlation of the high groundwater recharge zones coinciding with high rainfall zones the groundwater potential zones indicated that groundwater potentials in afram plains is moderate with an area coverage of 2168 52 km2 the spatial groundwater recharge results from the swat model coincided with the remote sensing results that are moderate and high groundwater potential zones findings from this study can be used by stakeholders for policy development to ensure restoring and protection of water related resources in the study area and nationally hence to ensure that the sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 achievement does not dwindle in the area in the analysis it was found in the afram plains that the groundwater delay time gw delay is the most sensitive

11838,the afram plains watershed is one of the major watersheds located at the lower part of the volta basin in ghana with high groundwater usage dependency on groundwater is a fast growing concern in the plains due to the unreliable supply of surface water this has put the groundwater resources under intense pressure and has necessitated the need for sustainable management of the groundwater resources this study aimed to estimate the recharge spatial distribution and potential recharge zones of groundwater at different scales in the afram plains area using the soil and water assessment tool swat model and geography information system gis approach the swat model was set up 1983 2016 calibrated 1983 1990 and validated 1991 1997 using digital elevation model soil land use climate datasets and discharge data the gis approach was used to produce thematic maps for eight contributing factors rainfall elevation land cover land use lineaments drainage geology soil and slope for mapping the recharge zones the results showed that about 1 65 19 3 mm of the swat simulated mean annual rainfall 1176 9 mm is converted into groundwater recharge in the watershed the potential recharge zones categorized as very poor poor moderate and high zones have area coverages of 0 58 20 8 km2 22 4 798 km2 60 9 2169 km2 and 16 2 576 km2 respectively the potential recharge zones after validation over boreholes and wells data indicated that the afram plains area is dominated by the moderate potential zone graphical abstract image 1 keywords swat groundwater groundwater potential zone remote sensing techniques afram plains 1 introduction using soil and water assessment tool swat techniques and remote sensing for groundwater recharge estimation is a way of simplifying the complexities of groundwater modelling into groundwater resources development and sustainable management the occurrence of groundwater is dependent upon the geology which includes slope lithology rock types soil types and elevation topography lineament geomorphology and rainfall lone et al 2016 however precipitation enters into the soil stratum to fill the empty soil voids and percolates deep into the aquifer media kindie et al 2019 sunkari et al 2021 and is stored as groundwater globally groundwater has been considered the world s most freshwater resource for domestic use and the replenishment of the ecosystem through baseflow senanayake et al 2016 khader 2017 pranav et al 2017 sunkari et al 2018 2019 recent studies have shown that groundwater management requires the use of the current techniques of ingenuity to mimic the behaviour of aquifers and deterioration due to overexploitation sunkari et al 2020 in this regard the vulnerability of groundwater studies have been extensively conducted by many researchers all over the world using various methods such as swat drastic model susceptibility index si geographic information system gis and an analytic hierarchy process ahp hamza et al 2006 2010 agarwal et al 2013 sener and davraz 2013 mostert 2014 agyare et al 2017 mahrez et al 2017 shakoor et al 2018 krogulec et al 2019 the afram plains area is part of the lower volta basin in ghana in this area agyare et al 2017 studied the groundwater vulnerability but with less attention on recharge estimation recharge estimation is an indication of the amount of water within the aquifer s as well as the informative trend of the replenishment of the aquifers remote sensing techniques can enable the estimation of the potential recharge zones to unequivocally achieve the united nation s sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 the use of advanced techniques are required to intensify research in the water sector however plausible impacts of land use and climate change may pose a threat to the recharge of groundwater groundwater recharge depletion is one of the current challenges facing majority of aquifers throughout the world however the battle to meet the increasing water demands has compelled many cities and communities all over the world to use groundwater to complement demand the dependency of the people living around the afram plains on groundwater is a fast growing concern in the plains where hydrogeological dynamics of the terrain has not been well studied the available source of water supply to the inhabitants of the afram plains area is centered on groundwater the sustainability of the groundwater resource in the afram plains is dwindling as over abstraction supervenes recharge however the afram plains area has been recognized as one of the poorest districts in ghana of which agriculture is its main economic activity the plains also lost physical access to the other parts of the country making it a peninsula district yidana and ophori 2008 the high competition among water users in the plains for domestic use farming and livestock is an issue that has to be investigated using groundwater modelling tools such modelling endeavours can characterize the groundwater conditions such as potential recharge zones and recharge rates in the watershed of the afram plains area however proper recharge estimation modellings are useful elements for groundwater management data scarcity has been a major limitation to conduct groundwater recharge modelling in ghana which constrained several experts to develop models for proper groundwater management and policy implementation several methods and techniques have been used to estimate groundwater or aquifer recharge and potential recharge zones conventionally the cumulative rainfall departure crd chloride mass balance cmb extended model for aquifer recharge and moisture transport through unsaturated hardrock earth groundwater modelling gm water balance water table fluctuation wtf and saturated volume fluctuation svf methods were commonly used to estimate aquifer recharge xu and beekman 2003 lee et al 2006 these methods and approaches are always not suitable for the complex modelling of groundwater recharge and potential recharge zones in recent times advanced models have been developed for groundwater recharge modelling and potential recharge zones delineation these models include swat modflow model loukika et al 2020 analytical hierarchy process ahp dar et al 2020 das and mukhopadhyay 2018 remote sensing and gis adeyeye et al 2019 arnous et al 2020 berhanu and hatiye 2020 bhowmick and ojha 2019 ouchar et al 2020 and artificial neural networks ann naghibi et al 2018 these modelling techniques often involve different datasets which are not available at the basin catchment or watershed scale also some of these modelling techniques also require sophisticated software time consuming expensive computer programs and computationally demanding the main aim of this research is to estimate the groundwater recharge and the potential recharge zones in the afram plains area of ghana using swat and remote sensing techniques this would serve as a framework for monitoring and management of groundwater in the afram plains area 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the afram plains area is located in the lower volta river basin in the eastern region of ghana it is sited between latitude 6 6080 and 7 1300 n and longitude 0 0542 and 0 4926 e fig 1 the afram plains area has a geographical area of 5446 km2 as the largest district in the region with an undulating land surface ranging between 60 and 120 m above mean sea level the area is bounded to the north by the obosum river to the east by the volta lake and the south west and south by the afram river agyare et al 2017 the average annual rainfall in the afram plains area ranges between 1150 and 1650 mm however the highest rainfall ever recorded in the afram plains area occurred in 1986 with an annual maximum depth of 1832 mm and a minimum depth of 546 mm which also occurred in 1987 agyare et al 2017 wet season in the afram plains area starts from april to october and dry season from november to late march some water demands are met during the wettest rainy period from may to september the climate within the year traverses between warm and hot with annual mean temperatures of about 36 6 36 8 c which generally peaks up around february to late march before the start of the rainfall season relative humidity is generally between 70 and 80 throughout the year agyare et al 2017 the transitional savannah forest has been recently dominated by grasses due to clearing of lands for activities such as farming cattle grazing and production of charcoal 2 2 soil types geology and hydrogeology the soil types found in the afram plains area are plinthosols fluvisols regosols lixisols luvisols and leptosols obuobie and barry 2010 lixisols are the most dominant soil type found in the area the afram plains area is predominantly overlain by late precambrian to ordovician aged sedimentary rocks belonging to the voltaian supergroup davies and cobbing 2002 locally rocks in the area are members of the upper middle voltaian beds of the obosum formation they are composed of sandstones shales siltstones and conglomerates majority of these rocks are tectonically stable except those exposed along the eastern fringe of the voltaian supergroup which have been affected by n s striking folds davies and cobbing 2002 however at a few kilometers away from this zone of folding the sediments appear to be flat lying showing no intrusive suites with a few large faults the sandstones and conglomerates around the east west fringe of the area are capped by well drained sandy soils whereas the well cemented feldspathic sandstones at the western domain are capped by ferricrete duricrust davies and cobbing 2002 also the basal shales outcropping at the southern peripheral are overlain by thick poorly drained clayey soils the aquifer systems are characterized by semi confined aquifers with low permeability and secondary permeability within fractured zones acheampong and hess 1998 davies and cobbing 2002 the lithology of the southern voltaian aquifers is grouped into five divisional rock regions fig 2 c which include feldspathic sandstone siltstone arkose and mudstone fractured shale and grey sandstone sandstone and massive conglomerate quartzitic sandstone and conglomerate and unfractured shale and sandstone acheampong and hess 1998 davies and cobbing 2002 this indicates that shale mudstone sandstone conglomerate siltstone and limestone are the main rock units within aquifers of the afram plains area the aquifer of the southeastern division consists of fractured shale and grey sandstone fig 2c due to low permeabilities in this division the groundwater potential varies between poor and moderate with drilling depth of boreholes between 50 and 100 m the success rate of drilling is about 50 yidana and ophori 2008 the water in this region is saline and not preferable for many purposes in the area the central division of the rocks region consists of quartzitic sandstones and conglomerates aquifer properties are based on fracturing and weathering of these rocks with the success rate of drilling a wet well reaching about 50 with a good groundwater quality for many domestic purposes borehole depths are characterized by an average of 55 m with yields of 10 960 l min the static water levels of boreholes in the area range from 1 to 20 m and the aquifers have transmissivities in the range of 1 71 6 m2 day acheampong and hess 1998 the southwestern division composes of unfractured shale and sandstone with poorly defined hydrogeological properties in the area fig 2c and d in the sandstone and massive conglomerate division groundwater basically occurs within the fractured and weathered areas with about 66 of drilling projects in the division prolific aquifers identified in the feldspathic sandstone siltstone arkose and mudstone division aquifers are characterized by high degrees of deep fracture systems and weathering with approximately 66 borehole drilling success rate yidana and ophori 2008 according to acheampong and hess 1998 groundwater recharge in the afram plains area is centered within the mid section of the area due to the undulating topography of the area there seems to be a hydraulic connection between surface water and groundwater resources in the area where surface water bodies are recharging and feeding the groundwater aquifers fig 2d but this needs detailed hydrogeological investigation to confirm it 3 materials and methods 3 1 spatial data the spatial datasets used to setup the swat model for the watershed included digital elevation model dem soil and land use land cover shuttle radar topographic mission digital elevation model was downloaded from the consultative group on international agricultural research consortium for spatial information cgiar csi 2018 with 30 m 30 m resolution the land use land cover and the soil data were obtained from landsat image classification and the council for scientific and industrial research soil research institute csir sri kwadaso respectively the land use land cover of the study area was analyzed through the use of satellite imagery with 30 30 m resolution supervised classification using the spectral angle mapper sam algorithm in envi 5 3 was used to classify the images after spectral signatures of the various classes were generated six classes were developed they were based on the ghana land use and land cover classification scheme for visual classification of remote sensing data öztekin et al 2008 the afram plains soil and geological maps were extracted from the soil and geological maps of ghana and converted from polygon to raster using the conversion tool in the arcgis interface these maps were reclassified a weight of 12 0 12 was assigned to the reclassified soil raster map luvisols and lixisols soils dominate the soil formation in the afram plains area fig 2b 3 2 meteorological and discharge datasets climatic datasets were obtained from the ghana meteorological agency gmet the data included solar radiation temperature relative humidity precipitation and wind speed to augment the limited spatial distribution of the stations datasets for the simulation 24 gridded data for all the five parameters were obtained from the global weather data for period 1979 2014 globalweather tamu edu the missing or skipped station data were filled with 99 0 the value 99 0 tells swat weather generator to compute values to replace the missing data gaps during the simulation time daily discharge data for the period 1983 1997 was collected from the hydrological service department hsd 3 3 hydrological modelling using the swat model 3 3 1 swat model setup the steps of the swat model setup for the afram plains watershed fig 3 was performed by following the stepwise procedures outlined in the swat user manual and by various researchers e g arnold et al 2012a b dile et al 2016 abbaspour et al 2017 the dem was used to delineate the slopes and the watershed into 61 sub basins in the qswat interface three slope classes were used in the watershed creation 0 5 5 8 and 8 999 hydrological response units hrus were created using multiple hru option by land use slope and soil in all 61 hrus were created with a defined slope land and soil threshold of 10 the model was simulated for 17 years 1980 1997 with 3 years as model warm up period dile and srinivasan 2014 dile et al 2016 3 3 2 groundwater recharge simulation swat model simulation considers two types of aquifer systems shallow and deep aquifers at each hru arnold et al 1993 in swat shallow aquifer reaches a depth of about 2 20 m with deep aquifer above 20 m arnold et al 1993 arnold et al 2012a b this study considered groundwater recharge as the amount of water that occurs as a result of infiltration through percolation from the soil profile and it is calculated by swat as 1 w rchg j 1 exp 1 δ gw w seep exp 1 δ gw w rch g i 1 where w r c h g i 1 and w r c h g i are the amount of water recharging the aquifer on day i 1 mm and i mm whereas w s e e p and δ g w are the amount of water from the soil profile entering the vadose zone and the time of delay or drainage time in days respectively w r c h g is the total amount of water recharge neitsch et al 2005 the amount of recharge partition that enters into shallow and deep aquifers are simulated in the swat model using the following equations 2 w rcg sh w rchg d p rech 3 d p rech β deep w rchg where w r c g s h is the amount recharge to shallow aquifer on a day i mm d p r e c h is the amount to recharge to the deep aquifer on a day i mm and β d e e p is the percolation coefficient of the aquifer neitsch et al 2005 3 3 3 calibration and evaluation of the model calibration and validation of the swat model parameters were based on manual and sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 algorithm dile et al 2016 using daily discharge data from aframso river gauge station for the period between 1983 and 1997 the model was calibrated and validated with the data from 1983 to 1990 and 1991 to 1997 respectively during the manual calibration of the swat model very few parameters were performed which included curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 alpha bf baseflow alpha factor and esco soil evaporation compensation factor during the sufi2 iterations simulation nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was also selected as an objective function with a behavioural threshold of 0 25 and 200 simulations per each iteration for the calibration of the parameters it is desirable that the model should reflect the biophysical conditions of the study area therefore the swat model performance was evaluated using these statistical methods nse coefficient of determination r2 and pbias nse is a statistical method that has been widely used for determining the magnitude of the simulated values as compared to the observed flow nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse

sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to evaluate the model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the swat model were carried out using sequence uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 algorithm in the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 2007 one at a time oat sensitivity method was used during the sufi2 iterations to scan the parameters of high sensitivity however the significance and high sensitivity parameters were assessed using the p values and t stat values respectively the larger the absolute value of the t stat the more sensitive the parameter whereas the p values were used to determine the significance of the sensitivity of the parameters and where the p value become close to zero the more significant the parameter khalida et al 2016 3 4 groundwater potential zones mapping in this study soil land use land cover slope rainfall elevation drainage density and lineament density were used as the input parameters for groundwater potential zones identification fig 4 these parameters characteristics control the recharge storage and movement of groundwater this method was in line with studies conducted by several researchers who considered similar inputs factors bhowmick and ojha 2019 kindie et al 2019 rani et al 2019 arnous et al 2020 berhanu and hatiye 2020 dar et al 2020 ouchar et al 2020 bhattacharya et al 2021 3 4 1 rainfall the daily rainfall data collected was converted into average annual rainfall which was used to generate the spatial distribution of rainfall using inverse weight distance iwd tool in the arcgis interface the rainfall map prepared was further classified into five classes of area coverage that is very low 40 72 low 21 46 moderate 32 17 high 4 98 and very high 0 67 fig 5 a a weight value of 14 0 14 was assigned to it siddi raju et al 2019 3 4 2 elevation the elevation of the study area was extracted from the elevation map of ghana in the arcgis environment the map created was categorized into four classes very low 50 100 m low 100 150 m moderate 150 200 m and high 200 250 m fig 5b a weight of 11 0 11 was assigned to the elevation map during groundwater potential zone calculation the study area is a plain and therefore high priority was given to the low elevation areas due to the influence on surface runoff infiltration thapa et al 2017 commented that plain areas are associated with low elevations which induces a longer retention period of surface runoff to cause high infiltration of recharge to groundwater 3 4 3 drainage density dd the drainage density of the watershed was generated from the srtm dem with 30 30 m resolution through arcgis interface using line density command the drainage density map was reclassified in five classes very low low moderate high and very high and assigned a weighted value of 11 0 11 fig 5c during the analytical hierarchy process ahp method 7 dd le a where le is the total length of all the rivers and streams and a is the total of the drainage basin or the watershed 3 4 4 slope the slope map was prepared from the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem 30 30 m resolution using slope command from the arcgis interface the slope of the study area was classified into five classes which varies in percentages from 0 to 27 and thus from very good to very poor fig 6 b weighted value of 11 0 11 to it during the ahp method the very good area is nearly flat due to the terrain nature of afram plains which influences more infiltration rates this was in line with a study conducted by chowdhury et al 2008 3 4 5 lineament density ld the srtm dem was used to extract the lineament networks using pci geomatica trial version lineament density km km2 map was then prepared in arcgis using the line density command the map was reclassified into five classes very poor 635 47 km2 poor 815 15 km2 moderate 1048 57 km2 high 1148 34 km2 whiles very high class covers 439 94 km2 fig 6a a weight of 12 0 12 was assigned to the raster map according to the ahp method for the calculation of groundwater potential zones low weight was assigned to low lineament density and high weight were assigned to the high lineaments due to the influence of infiltration by high lineaments 8 ld le a where le is the total length of all lineaments and a is the unit area 3 4 6 geological map the afram plains area s geological map was extracted from the geological map of ghana and converted from polygon to raster using the conversion tool in the arcgis interface this map was reclassified a weight of 18 0 18 was assigned to the reclassified geological raster map fig 6 c the geological setting of the study area is greatly dominated by mainly shale mudstone beds mainly sandy pebble beds followed by calcareous sands along the eastern border of the volta lake basaltic andesitic trachytic lava agglomerate tuff jasper were also found with the calcareous sands along the eastern border however mainly sandstones were also found in the south western corridor of the study area acheampong and hess 1998 davies and cobbing 2002 3 5 analytical hierarchy process and weighted overlay multi criteria analysis evaluation of analytical hierarchy process was employed das and mukhopadhyay 2018 argaz et al 2019 arulbalaji et al 2019 the most influential thematic factors for groundwater potential zoning were examined and assigned weightage based on the hydrological prevailing conditions within the study area the assigned weights for each thematic map were used as inputs during the weighted overlay saaty s scale of 1 9 was used to rank the classes of the thematic maps saaty 1977 table 1 the classes which were deduced as equal important were assigned a value of 1 while the 9 was assigned to classes of extremely important to groundwater potential occurrence storage and movement for saaty s scale 1 to 9 of importance see saaty 1977 4 results and discussion 4 1 land use land cover the major land use land cover classes identified in the study area with their spatial distributions were bare land open spaces roads and rocks 1278 70 km2 with 24 of the total land coverage farmlands cropland fallow land and plantation 883 90 km2 with an area cover of 16 forest forest and forest plantation 1505 80 km2 constituted the most dominant land use land cover with an area of coverage 28 settlements urban and rural communities 58 79 km2 is the least class constituting 1 trees and shrubs 560 55 km2 10 and water bodies volta lake rivers and streams 1158 55 km2 also aggregated to 21 of the watershed fig 2a general observation depicted that the spatial distribution of the bare land and rocks and farmlands were observed within the central and along the volta lake and the afram river part of the afram plains area the forested areas were also dominant in the north western part of the plains settlements which constituted the urban and rural communities were also observed docketed all over the plains trees and shrubs were also dominant along the water bodies within the plains 4 2 swat model sensitivity calibration and uncertainty analysis a total of five parameters were chosen for the afram river simulations after performing sensitivity analysis table 2 the groundwater delay time gw delay was found to be the most sensitive parameter among the five parameters selected the gw delay t stat value was recorded at 3 6 with approximate differences of 0 53 and 2 08 for cn2 and esco parameters respectively the alpha bf and gwqwmin p values recorded showed less significance in the watershed modelling as compared to the most sensitivity parameters evaluating the monthly observed flow using the 95ppu in figs 7 and 8 provided the statistics for nse r factor and p factor in table 3 during the calibration period 1983 1990 the model recorded the p factor and r factor of 0 81 and 1 27 respectively the p factor and r factor obtained during the validation period were 0 75 and 1 21 respectively the per cent of observed data enveloped together by the 95ppu during both calibration and validation were 81 and 75 which were within the recommended acceptable performance of a model abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour 2015 the objective function statistical results showed that nse values were 0 89 and 0 80 for the calibration period 1983 1990 and the validation period 1991 1997 respectively the nse value saw an improvement during the sufi2 calibration of 0 09 0 89 as against 0 80 recorded during the swat model calibration a similar significant increase in calibration performed by sufi2 results were reported by koycegiz and buyuyildiz 2019 the nse values recorded were very good according to the recommended range by moriasi et al 2007 koycegiz and buyuyildiz 2019 and kwarteng et al 2020 the calibrated and validated r2 values obtained were 0 90 and 0 80 respectively according to mylevaganam et al 2015 high r2 values indicate fewer errors with the observed data with a recommended acceptable value of r2 0 5 the r2 values obtained in this study were very good the pbias was 0 7 in calibration and 3 1 in the validation the positive and negative pbias values indicated the model bias towards underestimation and overestimation respectively gupta et al 1999 the pbias value of 0 70 recorded for the streamflow calibration was within the very good range pbias 10 according to obuobie 2008 the swat model simulates low and high flows as underestimation and overestimation respectively the underestimation recorded in the calibration could be as a result of more water contributing to base flow from more than one shallow aquifer to the base flow of the adjacent streams within the study area watershed the results obtained for the pbias nse and r2 were very good and according to moriasi et al 2007 koycegiz and buyuyildiz 2019 and kwarteng et al 2020 table 4 the results of hydrological simulations are satisfactory pbias 25 nse 0 5 and r2 0 6 these statistics results show that the swat model was able to simulate the hydro biophysical parameters of the afram plains and therefore the model is considered for further hydrological studies in the watershed 4 3 mean monthly and annual distribution of swat simulated rainfall and recharge in fig 9 the simulated mean monthly 1983 1997 distribution of the hydrological components from the swat model simulation showed that throughout the year the highest mean monthly rainfalls were recorded in june 159 24 mm july 176 54 mm september 165 97 mm and october 163 40 mm the highest rainfall was found in july the groundwater recharge gw rchg was steady from late february through to may and after which it recorded sharp high peaks in july september and october it was further observed that the for monthly and annnual gw rchg increased as rainfall peaks and declines as rainfall recedes figs 9 and 10 analytically it is valid to mention that the rainfall in afram plains starts in april to october with about four to five months of the dry season which was also reported by agyare et al 2017 4 4 spatial distribution of groundwater recharge the spatial distribution of swat simulated rainfall and recharge at monthly scale over the afram plains watershed is shown in fig 11 according to fig 11a the spatial monthly mean rainfall values recorded range between 81 53 and 115 32 mm the distribution of the rainfall over the watershed showed that some communities within the northwest and southeastern part of the afram plains district experience high rainfall as compared to those closer to the volta lake fig 11a the analysis showed that the groundwater recharge gw rchg component of the spatial results ranged between less than 0 01 103 70 mm fig 11b it was further found out that the spatial results of the gw rchg distribution within the watershed were coinciding with the precipitation and the water yield values distributed over the watershed moreover the lower spatial gw rchg results observed in the northwestern were in line with davies and cobbing 2002 and yidana and ophori 2008 studies which showed that areas around maame krobo through kwasi fante is dominated by mudstone siltstone arkose and feldspathic sandstone are considered as a poor recharge zone with about as a result of the underlined cemented layer of 60 m deep furthermore the high recharge observed in northeastern found within the sandstone regions which include donkokrom somsei adiemmra kwasi kuma and abomosarefo according to yidana and ophori 2008 and agyare et al 2017 these areas experience moderate to high aquifer recharge with 66 successful rate of drilling of a wet well however the simulated reach flow out 15 results which corresponded to the observed data was found in the draw outlet 5th subbasin which is located at obosum river in the northern part of the afram plains watershed this confirms that a greater percentage of the surface runoffs were being discharged in the northern part of the watershed it is essential to determine the amount of rainfall distribution that goes into groundwater recharge the aquifer in afram plains is considered a semi confined aquifer system with a low primary permeability and secondary permeability around fractured zones acheampong and hess 1998 davies and cobbing 2002 therefore the simulation and calibration were defined based on aquifer behaviours and as well as observations the analysis of the average annual hydrological components simulated from the model baseline ran as the proportion of the precipitation over the watershed as shown in fig 12 this was in line with a study conducted to estimate groundwater recharge in the upper basin white volta basin by obuobie 2008 during the model simulation period it was observed that 66 57 of the mean annual rainfall 1176 90 mm was lost to the actual evapotranspiration in the watershed the water yield component comprises about 45 of the mean annual rainfall 530 69 mm of which lateral flow accounts for 0 19 while q surf and q gw account for 14 54 and 28 71 respectively the amount of the mean rainfall to the groundwater recharge w rchg in the watershed is about 32 85 386 64 mm of which 1 65 19 33 mm recharge the deep aquifer system the amount 32 85 to recharge groundwater w rchg comprises both deep and shallow aquifer recharge in the watershed neitsch et al 2005 2011 the swat model simulated the amount to the deep aquifer recharge as 1 65 19 33 mm this result obtained could have been validated with the aquifer percolation coefficient of the area in the watershed the simulated et of 66 57 rainfall as the highest value obtained is an indication that the highest water loss in the afram plains is dominated by et the seasonal growth of crops and vegetations can be attributed to the highest et value obtained the results observed from the various parameters is the representation of the relationship between the swat model hydrological components however these results obtained from the model were in line with various studies conducted in the upper part of the volta basin whereas afram plains are in the lower part of the basin martin 2006 obuobie 2008 4 5 groundwater potential zone and validation after the analytical hierarchy process and the weighted overly procedure the final groundwater potential zoning map fig 12 revealed four zones which include very poor poor moderate and high the total area without the volta lake water body of the groundwater potentials map produced is 3562 64 km2 the very poor and poor groundwater potential zone covered 0 58 and 22 39 of the study area respectively the moderate and the high groundwater potential zone cover about 60 87 and 16 16 of the study area respectively from fig 12 a significant amount of the very poor was observed concentrating at the center of the watershed with less scattered zones throughout the map the results showed that moderate groundwater potential areas are seen dominated the area however observations from the map fig 12 showed that the high groundwater potential areas coincided the very low and low drainage density flat areas of the slope map 1 57 5 10 and the nearly gentle flat areas of the elevation map ranging 50 100 m and as well as the very high lineament density areas areas of moderate groundwater potentials were also found in the slope per cent of 1 57 5 10 very low drainage density very high lineament density and elevation 50 150 m these observations consisted of studies conducted by other researchers manap et al 2011 rahmati et al 2014 further findings also revealed that the high rainfall areas coincided with the high groundwater potential areas moreover the central part of the plains is dominated by high elevations and slope experiences poor groundwater potentials the groundwater potential zones map was verified with 29 boreholes and hand dug wells yield data fashae et al 2013 argaz et al 2019 kindie et al 2019 the existing groundwater yield data of the boreholes and hand dug wells coordinates were superimposed on the groundwater potentials map showed that the very poor class of the groundwater potential zones recorded nil indicating that none of the hand dug wells or boreholes was found yielding water within those potentials areas out of the 29 boreholes and hand dug wells points superimposed on the map 10 34 50 matched with poor groundwater potentials zones 17 58 60 recorded in the moderate groundwater potential zones and 2 6 9 were also found within the high groundwater potentials zones the moderate groundwater potential zones recorded the highest number of yielding boreholes and hand dug wells in the study area this was in line with a study conducted by davies and cobbing 2002 according to davies and cobbing 2002 the north eastern and central part of the afram plains aquifer system groundwater potential is moderate whiles the southern and western part ranges from moderate to low the 58 60 of the number yielding boreholes and hand dug wells which matched the moderate groundwater potential class showed that the groundwater potential zones map and the boreholes and hand dug wells have a good correlation agreement this indicates that the groundwater potential is dominated by the moderate class it is therefore recommended that projects earmarked to drill more boreholes should be sited within the high potential zones for the communities within those zones however caution should be taken to avoid over abstraction 5 conclusions the fundamental focus of this research was to estimate groundwater recharge due to the immense pressure on groundwater as a result of insufficient surface water to meet demands for domestic and irrigation purposes in the afram plains area the following conclusions are drawn from the study the swat model estimated the mean monthly rainfall 1983 1997 to groundwater recharge w rchg to about 32 85 386 64 mm with 1 65 19 33 mm recharging the deep aquifer the mean monthly and annual swat simulations showed that the groundwater recharge increases as rainfall reaches its peak in the rainy seasons and decreases as rainfall subsides between late november and march the spatial results of the swat model showed a correlation of the high groundwater recharge zones coinciding with high rainfall zones the groundwater potential zones indicated that groundwater potentials in afram plains is moderate with an area coverage of 2168 52 km2 the spatial groundwater recharge results from the swat model coincided with the remote sensing results that are moderate and high groundwater potential zones findings from this study can be used by stakeholders for policy development to ensure restoring and protection of water related resources in the study area and nationally hence to ensure that the sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 achievement does not dwindle in the area in the analysis it was found in the afram plains that the groundwater delay time gw delay is the most sensitive

introduction the coastal areas worldwide are fast becoming hubs of social economic activities this has led to an increase in the population of these areas and hence the demand for freshwater for domestic use agriculture industrial other activities has also increased gopalakrishnan et al 2020 cardona et al 2004 the availability of surface and groundwater is greatly affected by climatological conditions of the arid to semi arid coastal areas hassan et al 2022 various natural and anthropogenic activities have also degraded the already scarce surface water resources hussain 2021 murdoch et al 2000 ntengwe 2006 bilotta and brazier 2008 this has increased groundwater extraction in coastal areas worldwide i pla et al 2014 in semi arid to arid coastal areas surface water flow to the sea is in small quantities leading to the inland flow of saline seawater bear et al 1999 seawater intrusion is one of the significant problems that influence the sustainable management of groundwater resources leghouchi et al 2009 in the coastal areas fresh groundwater resources are present landwards and the saline groundwater towards the coast the extent of seawater intrusion into the land varies from region to region depending on climatological conditions therefore the demarcation of saline and fresh groundwater resources is one of the main goals for sustainable groundwater development in coastal areas this has led to an increase in exploration and the assessment of groundwater quality using sophisticated techniques obiefuna and sheriff 2011 sheriff et al 2006 surface geophysical techniques are very effective in delineating the groundwater resources for sustainable management and are considered one of the easiest suitable and economical it is also an appropriate method for assessing the groundwater quality for domestic agricultural and industrial use and environmental studies hassan et al 2019 2020 loke et al 2013 such techniques are used in different environments and sedimentary regimes worldwide gao et al 2018 telford et al 1990 these are applied to investigate the subsurface groundwater potential the nature of aquifers and the quality of the groundwater in the vicinity of rivers seas and oceans where seawater intrusion is one of the major concerns todd 2004 the electrical resistivity method has been used by various researchers to study the salinity of groundwater and is effectively used for delineating the saline fresh water interface in aquifers near the coastal areas hasan et al 2017 zarroca et al 2011 electrical resistivity survey also termed as vertical electrical soundings ves it is a 1d survey and assesses physical properties like the subsurface resistivity porosity saturation of water in the subsurface and salinity resistivity values for saline and freshwater zones are different loke et al 2013 with an increase in the salinity of the groundwater the resistivity values decrease hence this method can effectively identify zones of high salinity and demarcation of the freshwater aquifer can easily be executed batayneh 2006 hamdan and vafidis 2013 electrical resistivity measurements are taken at the ground and the resistivity is calculated in the case of a homogenous soil this resistivity is equal to the true resistivity values for heterogeneous layers the calculated resistivity is not equal to the true resistivity and is termed as apparent resistivity and is used to estimate the true resistivity of the subsurface materials mostafa et al 2018 such measurements are termed electrical resistivity soundings ers true resistivity measurements can be directly conducted by in situ dc resistivity meter rekapalli et al 2015 pirou et al 2019 ers is done by using specific arrangements of arrays and is particularly helpful in areas where well data does not exist ers is effectively used to map the subsurface resistivity however where similar lithologies exist an overlap of electrical resistivity values may exist for fresh saline water in aquifers hasan et al 2020 to clear the ambiguities parameters like dar zarrouk are also estimated from ers data henriet 1976 d z parameters namely the longitudinal unit conductance s and transverse resistance t along with longitudinal and transverse resistivities have been used in various studies for saline and freshwater demarcation singh et al 2004 pakistan is a

global climatic changes and the rainfall pattern has been fluctuating furthermore the flow of water in the rivers of pakistan has been decreased due to various reasons and has caused a shortage of surface water resources in pakistan all this has led to groundwater use in pakistan which is continuously increasing ul haq et al 2021 khan et al 2008 rahman 1996 the study area uthal is located in the south of balochistan pakistan and is present at a distance of 13 26 km landwards from miani hor it is a swampy lagoon along the coast of the lasbela district balochistan pakistan uthal lies in porali plain in balochistan with its altitude between 20 and 75 m above mean sea level it is a semi arid area and has seen rapid growth in population in the last few decades this has led to an increase in water consumption with groundwater being the primary source khair et al 2015 as the study area is located near the coast the continuous groundwater extraction may lead to seawater intruding deeper into the land as the surface water is already scanty in this area and the continuous threat of seawater intrusion also exists it is essential to assess groundwater quality in this study ers data of 25 points are acquired and subsurface resistivity values are estimated the d z parameters are also calculated to demarcate saline and freshwater zones 2 location and geology of the study area the study area uthal is in the lasbela district balochistan and extends from 25 743400 to 25 86000 n latitude and 66 55000 to 66 66000 e longitude fig 1 a uthal is located in the porali plain an alluvial plain of the porali river towards the east the study area is bounded by the mor and pab ranges in its north lies the bela plain and on the west is the harro range the southern part is the lower parts of the porali plain which ends at sarinda lake the main formations in uthal are of ferozabad group with three formations kharrari malikhore anjira sembar formation and bela volcanics while the recent alluvial deposits cover the plains fig 1b bashir 2012 anwar 1991 fatmi et al 1990 the soil in uthal consists of fine sand and loose clay farid et al 2014 the eastern side is covered by alluvium from the kharrari river and in the hilly areas rock fragments are also present at the surface hamza and ali 2019 uthal has an arid climate and the summer months are extremely hot with mild and dry winters khan 2019 the field survey was conducted during mar april which is mostly very hot and dry uthal physiography comprises three features hills mountains on the east and west an alluvial plain in the central part and a coast on the south the study area has no perennial river only ephemeral streams are present in the area with khantara being the largest flowing from north to

areas of high relief and a sub parallel pattern in the plains ahmed et al 2013 the evaporation rate is very high and groundwater recharge is low 3 materials and methods 3 1 electrical resistivity soundings electrical resistivity sounding ers technique was used in the study area to obtain resistivity of the subsurface material it computes the subsurface resistivity distribution as a function of the physical properties of the subsurface materials bahammou et al 2021 store et al 2000 the subsurface resistivity is related to the electric current that flows through the subsurface materials this method determines the vertical variations of resistivities in the subsurface with depth such measurements are carried out where the subsurface layers are assumed to be almost horizontal and have little lateral variation the subsurface resistivity depends on the mineralization porosity permeability and fluid nature in the pore spaces akhter and hasan 2016 the resistivity in the subsurface varies from formation to formation and also within the same formation sharma 1997 the resistivity value increases with the grain size and also increases with compact rocks having fine grained textures the resistivity of water bearing formations depends on the nature of water with lower resistivity for saline water the resistivity values for formation also decrease due to an increase in clay content therefore such surveys can effectively mark the saline zones or high clay contents the resistivity data were collected with pasi model 16 gl n for 25 points fig 2 and apparent resistivity was estimated the apparent resistivities are based on ohm s law eq 1 as given below 1 v ir the electrical resistivity data is acquired by sending current i into the ground with two current electrodes and measuring the potential drop δv across the two potential electrodes with earth being the resistor the values of resistance obtained at each point are specific for the spacing of the four electrodes at that point and correcting factor which is known as the geometric factor k generates the apparent resistivity ρa as given in eq 2 reynolds 2011 2 ρ a k δ v i it is termed apparent resistivity because the value is the average of all the layer resistivities generated from the ers data the arrangement of these four electrodes can be done in several ways terms as array or configurations the commonly used configurations are schlumberger wenner pile dipole and pole pole the present study was conducted by the schlumberger configuration as it gives greater depth of investigation as compared to the wenner configuration in the schlumberger configuration the potential electrodes mn are placed inside and the current electrodes ab are placed symmetrically outside in an array fig 3 a the potential electrode spacing mn is kept small and the current electrode spacing ab is gradually increased penetration of current to deeper layers reynolds 2011 the voltage across the potential electrodes is measured as a function of the subsurface material that offers resistance to the current flow for large current electrode spacing the potential electrode spacing is also increased to get a better signal to noise ratio of the voltage measured telford et al 1990 the current electrode spacing ab 2 is plotted along with the apparent resistivity data on a logarithmic paper and by curve matching done by software ipi2win bobachev 2002 and resistivity values estimated the resistivity values thus obtained are converted into the true layer resistivity in units of ohm meter ωm by correlating with available lithologic logs ebong 2014 the depth of penetration and investigation is half electrode spacing ab 2 and in this study ab 2 is 150 m the resistivity values thus estimated are used to differentiate between the subsurface materials as they are dependent on the physical properties of the lithologies and the nature of the water present in the pores this method can also provide a good estimation of the subsurface resistivity where well data is not available and can be used to generate 1d resistivity models that can be later converted to 2d or 3d models balasubramanian 2018 qadir et

conductance s in units mho transverse unit resistance t in ωm2 longitudinal resistivity rs ωm and transverse resistivity rt ωm are important in identifying the saline and freshwater zones in coastal and near coastal areas hasan et al 2019 batayneh 2013 their analysis can provide an easy and convincing solution for understanding the quality of water in aquifers saline or fresh from the surface geophysical data the dar zarrouk parameters are calculated for a model having n layers with thickness h and true resistivity values ρ estimated from the ers curve matching to get a better fit between the geophysical data and the subsurface parameters in this study d z parameters are calculated for removing ambiguities about the presence of saline water in the subsurface aquifers these parameters are calculated by the following equations eqs 3 6 for a section that has n layers with thickness h1 h2 hn and resistivities ρ1 ρ2 ρn respectively fig 4 the total thickness is the sum of the layer thickness h1 h2 hn h 3 s ρ 1 h 1 ρ 2 h 2 ρ n h n i 1 n ρ i h i 4 t ρ 1 h 1 ρ 2 h 2 i 1 n ρ i h i 5 r s h s 6 r t t s 4 results and discussion the ers data was obtained by keeping the electrode spacing at 5 00 m and the total spread length of 300 m for the data points the distance mn potential electrode spacing was increased from 0 5 to 20 m the distance ab 2 current electrode spacing fig 3 was increased gradually from 1 5 to 150 m the potential drop was then measured by sending the current through the current electrodes across the potential electrodes the investigation depth depends on the electrode spacing and the subsurface conductivities with the depth being directly proportional to the spacing and inversely to the conductivity of the materials in the subsurface the interpretation was done by repeated curve matching five geoelectrical layers table 1 were identified based on the resistivity method however due to the inhomogeneity and isotropy of the subsurface lithologies some limitations are expected in the estimation of subsurface lithologies from the resistivity method alone to overcome these limitations lithology log data were collected from the drilled borehole well a and well b fig 7 and correlated with the nearby ers stations 4 1 interpretation of ers data the first geoelectrical layer is from the surface down to a maximum depth of 15 m in east shows a resistivity variation from 600 ωm to 2600 ωm fig 5a this layer is composed of surficial material with three high resistivity zones on the southeast southwest and east the thickness of this layer is 01 15 m fig 6a the second geoelectrical layer shows a resistivity variation from 50 to 11 500 ωm fig 5b very high values are observed on the study area s far northwest indicating dry surface conditions the lower resistivity values are observed in the southeast which is closer to the coast in the central area resistivity values are uniformly distributed this layer shows the presence of unconsolidated sand the zone indicated the presence of freshwater very near the surface in the form of small lenses the thickness of the layer is from 01 to 21 m fig 6b the third geoelectrical layer shows an almost even distribution of resistivity values from 0 to 200 ωm fig 5c representing dry sand and clay layer on the southwest higher values are seen and a small pocket in the north also has a higher resistivity value thickness varies from 01 to 60 m fig 6c the fourth geoelectrical layer shows resistivity variation from 75 to 100 ωm fig 5d this layer has a thickness between 25 and 110 m fig 6d and is composed mainly of sand with fresh water this layer forms the major water bearing zone of the survey area the fifth geoelectrical layer has a resistivity distribution from 48 to 90 ωm fig 5e the lower resistivity values are observed in the southeast indicating some amount of saline water there whereas the rest of the area indicates the presence of a freshwater zone the layer thickness varies from 40 to 110 m fig 6e this layer is also comprised of recent sand and clay deposits the lithology data was collected from the local tube well owners and plotted on the log plot the lithologs from well a located at 250 41 18 n 66 36 11 e and well b located at 250 54 53 n 27 31 e are shown in fig 7 the lithologies estimated from the ers curves from the apparent resistivity ρa were matched with the lithologs for the nearby points ers curve with lithologies is shown in fig 8 the geophysical methods of electrical resistivity sounding ers are widely used to delineate the groundwater zones and also to demarcate the fresh saline waters in the subsurface the ers data can distribute the subsurface strata into several layers each with a specific resistivity value and delineate the fresh and saline water zones associated as done in this study figs 5 and 6 the five geoelectrical layers identified by the data are in the quaternary sediments comprising of unconsolidated material clay sand and gravel as resistivity values of lithologies are similar overlapping and intermixing of resistivity values are observed therefore to get a more reliable solution dar zarrouk d z parameters are applied for the identification of fresh saline water zones 4 2 the dar zarrouk d z parameters the dar zarrouk d z parameters longitudinal unit conductance s mho transverse unit resistance t ωm2 longitudinal resistivity rs ωm and transverse resistivity rt ωm are helpful in providing solutions for the delineation of saline fresh groundwater zones batayneh 2013 the d z parameters remove the ambiguities in the ers data interpretation where the overlapping of similar lithologies are present henriet 1976 hassan et al 2019 these parameters delineate the groundwater conditions and the hydrological characteristics from ers data batayneh 2013 maillet 1947 thus can delineate fresh saline groundwater zones without overlapping the longitudinal unit conductance s transverse unit resistance t longitudinal resistance rs and transverse resistivity rt are calculated from the surface geoelectrical data table 2 the values of longitudinal conductance s are between 0 1 and 1 65 mho fig 9 a and the transverse unit resistance t is greater than 25 000 ωm2 fig 9b the longitudinal resistivity rs is from 50 to 1350 ωm fig 9c and the transverse resistivity rt is from 22 to 1150 ωm fig 9d the lower values of less than 2 mho for s and greater than 8000 ωm2 for t indicate the presence of freshwater as given by singh et al 2004 for the coastal aquifers and by hasan et al 2020 therefore the d z parameters result shows that the groundwater zones of the study area are freshwater zones and match the ers data results 5 conclusions as the study area uthal lies near the coastal area of balochistan with an arid climate and the population here depends on the groundwater resources for their day to day uses as well the crops that they grow for their livelihood this study therefore aimed at understanding the subsurface distribution of resistivities and identification of saline water zones in the areas and to identify whether the seawater has intruded these terrains for this the surface geoelectrical data of 25 points was obtained schlumberger configuration and true resistivities of the subsurface and 1d depth model were obtained five geoelectrical layers were obtained with a thin 01 15 m first layer consisting of unconsolidated dry surface material having true resistivity between 600 and 2600 ωm the second layer 01 21 m consists mainly of sand with lenses of freshwater near the surface and hard rock fragments and very dry conditions towards the northwest of the study area having resistivity variation from 50 to 11 500 ωm the third layer 01 60 m shows an overall uniform distribution of resistivity of up to 200 ωm and is comprised mainly of sand and clay with fresh water the fourth layer 25 110 m was the main water producing zone and had fresh water in sand with resistivities of 75 100 ωm the last layer comprised of sand and clay 40 110 m and showed a freshwater zone with resistivity in the range of 48 75 ωm the dar zarrouk parameters indicated the presence of fresh water in the area s ranging from 0 5 mho to 1 65 mho and t 25 000 ωm2 indicates that the area has freshwater aquifer and seawater has not intruded the longitudinal resistivity rs and the transverse resistivity rt are from 50 to 1350 ωm and 22 to above 1150 ωm respectively the results indicate that at present freshwater in the study area and saline water is present only in near surface pockets due to dry conditions and there is no seawater in the study area thick fresh groundwater aquifers are of sand and sand clay within the study area good pumping practices would ensure

system using the schlumberger array the data was acquired with a maximum current electrode spacing of 300 m the geoelectrical parameters measured were analyzed by ipi2win software by curve matching

data and dar zarrouk parameters show no occurrence of seawater intrusion graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater electrical resistivity survey dar zarrouk parameters arid region saline water 1 introduction the coastal areas worldwide are fast becoming hubs of social economic activities this has led to an increase in the population of these areas and hence the demand for freshwater for domestic use agriculture industrial other activities has also increased gopalakrishnan et al 2020 cardona et al 2004 the availability of surface and groundwater is greatly affected by climatological conditions of the arid to semi arid coastal areas hassan et al 2022 various natural and anthropogenic activities have also degraded the already scarce surface water resources hussain 2021 murdoch et al 2000 ntengwe 2006 bilotta and brazier 2008 this has increased groundwater extraction in coastal areas worldwide i pla et al 2014 in semi arid to arid coastal areas surface water flow to the sea is in small quantities leading to the inland flow of saline seawater bear et al 1999 seawater intrusion is one of the significant problems that influence the sustainable management of groundwater resources leghouchi et al 2009 in the coastal areas fresh groundwater resources are present landwards and the saline groundwater towards the coast the extent of seawater intrusion into the land varies from region to region depending on climatological conditions therefore the demarcation of saline and fresh groundwater resources is one of the main goals for sustainable groundwater development in coastal areas this has led to an increase in exploration and the assessment of groundwater quality using sophisticated techniques obiefuna and sheriff 2011 sheriff et al 2006 surface geophysical techniques are very effective in delineating the groundwater resources for sustainable management and are considered one of the easiest suitable and economical it is also an appropriate method for assessing the groundwater quality for domestic agricultural and industrial use and environmental studies hassan et al 2019 2020 loke et al 2013 such techniques are used in different environments and sedimentary regimes worldwide gao et al 2018 telford et al 1990 these are applied to investigate the subsurface groundwater potential the nature of aquifers and the quality of the groundwater in the vicinity of rivers seas and oceans where seawater intrusion is one of the major concerns todd 2004 the electrical resistivity method has been used by various researchers to study the salinity of groundwater and is effectively used for delineating the saline fresh water interface in aquifers near the coastal areas hasan et al 2017 zarroca et al 2011 electrical resistivity survey also termed as vertical electrical soundings ves it is a 1d survey and assesses physical properties like the subsurface resistivity porosity saturation of water in the subsurface and salinity resistivity values for saline and freshwater zones are different loke et al 2013 with an increase in the salinity of the groundwater the resistivity values decrease hence this method can effectively identify zones of high salinity and demarcation of the freshwater aquifer can easily be executed batayneh 2006 hamdan and vafidis 2013 electrical resistivity measurements are taken at the ground and the resistivity is calculated in the case of a homogenous soil this resistivity is equal to the true resistivity values for heterogeneous layers the calculated resistivity is not equal to the true resistivity and is termed as apparent resistivity and is used to estimate the true resistivity of the subsurface materials mostafa et al 2018 such measurements are termed electrical resistivity soundings ers true resistivity measurements can be directly conducted by in situ dc resistivity meter rekapalli et al 2015 pirou et al 2019 ers is done by using specific arrangements of arrays and is particularly helpful in areas where well data does not exist ers is effectively used to map the subsurface resistivity however where similar lithologies exist an overlap of electrical resistivity values may exist for fresh saline water in aquifers hasan et al 2020 to clear the ambiguities parameters like dar zarrouk are also estimated from ers data henriet 1976 d z parameters namely the longitudinal unit conductance s and transverse resistance t along with longitudinal and transverse resistivities have been used in various studies for saline and freshwater demarcation singh et al 2004 pakistan is a

9d the lower values of less than 2 mho for s and greater than 8000 ωm2 for t indicate the presence of freshwater as given by singh et al 2004 for the coastal aquifers and by hasan et al 2020 therefore the d z parameters result shows that the groundwater zones of the study area are freshwater zones and match the ers data results 5 conclusions as the study area uthal lies near the coastal area of balochistan with an arid climate and the population here depends on the groundwater resources for their day to day uses as well the crops that they grow for their livelihood this study therefore aimed at understanding the subsurface distribution of resistivities and identification of saline water zones in the areas and to identify whether the seawater has intruded these terrains for this the surface geoelectrical data of 25 points was obtained schlumberger configuration and true resistivities of the subsurface and 1d depth model were obtained five geoelectrical layers were obtained with a thin 01 15 m first layer consisting of unconsolidated dry surface material having true resistivity between 600 and 2600 ωm the second layer 01 21 m consists mainly of sand with lenses of freshwater near the surface and hard rock fragments and very dry conditions towards the northwest of the study area having resistivity variation from 50 to 11 500 ωm the third layer 01 60 m shows an overall uniform distribution of resistivity of up to 200 ωm and is comprised mainly of sand and clay with fresh water the fourth layer 25 110 m was the main water producing zone and had fresh water in sand with resistivities of 75 100 ωm the last layer comprised of sand and clay 40 110 m and showed a freshwater zone with resistivity in the range of 48 75 ωm the dar zarrouk parameters indicated the presence of fresh water in the area s ranging from 0 5 mho to 1 65 mho and t 25 000 ωm2 indicates that the area has freshwater aquifer and seawater has not intruded the longitudinal resistivity rs and the transverse resistivity rt are from 50 to 1350 ωm and 22 to above 1150 ωm respectively the results indicate that at present freshwater in the study area and saline water is present only in near surface pockets due to dry conditions and there is no seawater in the study area thick fresh groundwater aquifers are of sand and sand clay within the study area good pumping practices would ensure the availability of freshwater for the domestic and agricultural uses of the area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
