destructive impacts on the groundwater quality requiring the continuous monitoring of groundwater quality especially for coastal arid and semi arid regions as well as small islands where groundwater and desalinated water are the main sources of water supply due to the lack of freshwater here optimal design of gmn is a crucial step in sustainable groundwater management and at the same time a significant challenge for specialists a gmn will be optimal if it provides relatively accurate information about the actual groundwater condition with the minimum number of monitoring wells gmn can be optimized by methods such as entropy theory genetic algorithms machine learning as well as msanos software most of them require a large number of monitoring data and they are very time consuming 1 2 in other words in these methods the more data there is the more accurate the optimization result will be literature indicates that these methods are highly efficient unless there is a limitation of the monitoring data number however the problem with these methods is that sometimes the optimization results of these methods indicate that the number and location of selected monitoring wells are inappropriate 3 4 in this situation despite spending a lot of time and money the collected data give a rudimentary understanding of groundwater quality furthermore these methods are incapable of determining the optimal number of monitoring stations and consequently this number is often selected empirically or based on available data and related budget constraint another method for optimal design of the monitoring network requiring less monitoring data is to apply a monitoring priority map indicating the most important areas to monitor in this method geographic information system is used to generate various spatial data layers of factors which have significant effects on groundwater quality then a spatial multicriteria decision is developed to obtain the weights of the factors overlay the data layers and generate a groundwater monitoring priority map 5 this method will be very efficient as long as geological and hydrodynamic information is available esquivel et al 2015 designed the groundwater level monitoring network for toluca valley aquifer mexico they considered six factors including decline and rise in groundwater levels the rate of decrease in groundwater levels vertical hydraulic gradient cracks and well density to prepare a monitoring priority map 6 singh and katpatal 2017 designed an optimal groundwater level monitoring network for wainganga basin india they considered nine factors including command and non command areas geology geomorphologic unit land use land cover lineament density groundwater level fluctuation recharge slope and soil media to generate monitoring priority map 7 they determined the optimal number of monitoring wells by trial and error and their location using multi criteria analysis in their study there is no correlation between the monitoring priority score and the density of the proposed monitoring wells in each area preziosi et al 2013 designed a groundwater quality monitoring network for a pilot area in central italy they considered different factors of hydrogeological setting groundwater vulnerability and natural and anthropogenic contamination levels to produce a monitoring priority map in their study the number of monitoring wells was not optimized and it was selected based on budget related constraint 8 besides the location of the wells was determined by an inaccurate method called point distance analysis reviewing the limited studies on the design of the gmn using the monitoring priority map specifies that the main focus of these studies has been on providing a more precise monitoring priority map a simple and efficient method has yet to be established to determine the optimal number and location of monitoring wells taking into account the risk of groundwater contamination recently azadi et al 2020 have proposed gamma test method to determine the optimal number and location of monitoring stations gamma test is a nonlinear modeling tool which can be used to determine the minimum number of required data to create a smooth model 9 in this method the monitoring network is determined such that with the minimum amount of monitoring data the spatial distribution of the desired parameter can be modeled with the maximum possible accuracy 10 this method in which only the latitude and longitude of the monitoring stations are analyzed is suitable for when the purpose is to prepare the zoning map of monitoring parameter in an area with the minimum amount of monitoring data however when the purpose is the groundwater quality monitoring based on the risk of groundwater contamination the geological and hydrodynamic parameters of the area as well as the damaging effects of human activities and industries should be considered in determining the location of monitoring wells to solve this problem this paper presents the idea of using a combination of gamma test and monitoring priority map for the optimal design of gmn there is evidence that applying galdit index is a popular method to provide an aquifer vulnerability map to seawater intrusion in coastal areas 11 12 the galdit index considering six parameters of aquifer type g aquifer hydraulic conductivity a the height of groundwater level relative to the sea level l distance from the shore d impact of existing status of seawater intrusion i and aquifer thickness t efficiently describes the seawater intrusion risk in coastal aquifers 13 this indicator only takes into account the effect of seawater intrusion on the increase in groundwater salinity while saline effluent injection into groundwater from different industries can exacerbate the groundwater salinity for this reason this paper uses fp galdit index a combination of the galdt index and the factors of f and p to generate the priority map of groundwater salinity monitoring for the first time this study provides a method to determine the number and location of optimal groundwater monitoring wells based on the monitoring priority map and gamma test the proposed method was applied to design an optimal groundwater salinity monitoring network for kish island persian gulf in recent years excessive extraction of groundwater leading to extensive seawater intrusion into the aquifer as well as injection of desalination plant concentrate of various industries into shallow wells have caused the increase in the groundwater salinity hence designing an optimal groundwater salinity monitoring network is needed for better mapping of salinity distribution and managing of groundwater resources on kish island for this purpose the map of groundwater salinity monitoring priority or aquifer vulnerability is first required to determine for kish island after providing the monitoring priority map for kish island the optimal number of monitoring wells was determined using gamma test finally a novel algorithm was applied to select monitoring wells using the monitoring priority map and gamma test result the algorithm was defined such that the monitoring well density is proportional to the monitoring priority in different regions and the total number of monitoring wells is equal to the optimal number 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview fig 1 illustrates the methodology flowchart used in this paper to determine the optimal number and location of groundwater salinity monitoring wells as seen the optimal network of groundwater monitoring is designed in a four step process at the first step the map of aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion was developed using the galdit index at the second step the priority map of groundwater salinity monitoring was provided for this purpose the factors of mean groundwater ec fluctuation f and distance from industries discharging saline effluents p were first mapped then the monitoring priority map was obtained by overlaying the map of galdit index f and p at the third step the optimal number of monitoring wells was specified the data of latitude longitude and the monitoring priority score of all existing wells were extracted then using these data and gamma test the minimum number of required wells for salinity monitoring was determined at the fourth step the optimal location of the monitoring wells was specified based on the gamma test result and the monitoring priority map this step was performed using a simple and efficient algorithm that will be described in section 2 6 2 2 study area kish island with more than 91 km2 area is an important tourist destination in the persian gulf region this island is located about 18 km off the southern coast of iran from 53 53 to 54 04 e and 26 29 to 26 35 n fig 2 persian gulf waters with total dissolved solids tds of about 40 g l surround the groundwater resource of kish island 14 geological formations and the topography of the bedrock surface cause underground waters to flow from the center to the shoreline of the island and the hydraulic connection of the aquifer and sea to change along the coastline fig 3 the geology of kish island consists of two main layers the upper layer with 1 10 4 mean hydraulic conductivity contains condensed sand along with traces of crushed coral and the bottom layer with 1 10 6 m s mean hydraulic conductivity contains clay with lenses of silt ataie ashtiani 2010 fig 4 b indicates the groundwater level in november 2009 the two aforementioned geological layers and the depth of one well in a cross section of kish island the thickness of the upper permeable layer decreases from the center of the island to the shores most of the seasonal precipitation penetrates into the upper permeable layer and stops at the boundary of the marl layer according to previous studies the groundwater lens on the island due to its proximity to the coastline is always affected by seawater intrusion the average depth of wells on kish island is 12 5 m and the average distance between the ground level and the water level of the wells was about 11 m on kish island more than 244 wells are in operation in various sectors such as irrigation and drinking so that total annual groundwater consumption was estimated at roughly 3 7 mcm yr in 2018 as the kish island is enclosed with persian gulf waters and the well density is high in the coastal strip increase in groundwater salinity due to the seawater intrusion is a significant environmental issue also more than 10 desalination plants discharge about 5500 m3 yr saline effluent with the electrical conductivity ec between 6200 and 97 000 μs cm into the aquifer of kish island although the kish island s groundwater is of great importance an optimal plan for groundwater salinity monitoring has yet to be established only in three sampling periods during 2009 2010 the water level and ec of some wells have been measured hence an optimal network for groundwater monitoring seems more and more necessary to design for kish island 2 3 determining the map of aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion one of the useful indicators to evaluate and quantify the vulnerability of the coastal aquifers to seawater intrusion is the galdit index 15 galdit index which was first developed by chachadi and lobo ferrerou 2001 considers the effect of six hydrogeological factors on seawater intrusion risk the first factor is g which has a significant effect on the boundary interface of saline water and freshwater in unconfined aquifers if the groundwater level is reduced by 1 m the boundary interface of saline water and freshwater will raise by about 40 m 16 since the cone of depression in a confined aquifer is larger than that of in an unconfined aquifer for the same pumping rate the vulnerability of confined aquifer to seawater intrusion is higher than that of unconfined aquifer 17 bounded aquifer is another type of aquifer whose recharge and or impervious boundary is parallel to the coast 18 19 the lowest risk of seawater intrusion is considered for this type of aquifer 18 the second factor is a which affects the shape of depression cone during pumping the more the hydraulic conductivity the wider the depression cone and consequently the more the vulnerability to seawater intrusion 20 tidal pumping a natural phenomenon occurring in coastal areas can exacerbate the seawater intrusion in regions with high hydraulic conductivity 21 the third effective factor is l which provides a hydraulic pressure against the seawater intrusion 22 the salinity intrusion risk is higher in areas where the groundwater level is lower than the sea level 17 ghyben herzberg showed that the height of the fresh groundwater column at each point is about 40 m per each meter of fresh groundwater above sea level 23 d is the fourth factor in galdit index obviously as the distance from the coastline decreases the aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion increases the fifth factor is i which provides a proper understanding of the current condition of the seawater intrusion chemical components of groundwater such as tds ec and major cations and anions are usually used as a sign of the seawater intrusion 17 the sixth effective factor is t the higher the saturation aquifer thickness the higher the salinity intrusion risk 24 the aquifer thickness depends on the physical and geological conditions of the bedrock calculating the galdit index is started by identifying the effect of each factor on seawater intrusion for the study area then the values of each factor are scored between 1 lowest impact to 10 maximum impact based on the effect of different ranges of each factor on the seawater intrusion afterward the map of each factor is created next a weight is assigned to each map based on the relative importance of each factor in seawater intrusion finally the vulnerability is mapped by overlaying the weighted map of the factors 2 4 determining the map of groundwater monitoring priority as mentioned before the galdit index only indicates aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion while the destructive effect of human activities and industries on groundwater salinity must be considered for the monitoring priority map hence two factors of f and p are considered as indicators for the effect of human activities and industries on groundwater salinity f factor represents the quantitative and qualitative changes of groundwater this parameter induces the effect of anthropogenic activities and natural aquifer recharge due to rainfall not only groundwater ec but also its fluctuation is important to determine groundwater monitoring priority without parameter f we cannot achieve a correct map of groundwater monitoring priority if in a place groundwater ec is low but ec fluctuation is high this place has to be prioritized for monitoring because it has the potential to be saline in the future besides as the value of the p factor decreases the priority of groundwater monitoring increases then the map of each factor is created the values in each map are scored between 1 lowest impact to 10 highest impact based on the effect of different ranges of each factor on the increase in groundwater salinity next the map of each factor is created finally the monitoring priority map is created by overlaying the map of f p and galdit index with equal weights 2 5 determining the minimum number of required monitoring wells using gamma test gamma test is an analytical tool and allows users to specify the minimum number of required datasets of independent variables to model a dependent variable directly from the datasets and before modeling 25 27 the primary assumption of gamma test is that the variation of the dependent variable for two considered datasets must be relative to the variation of independent variables unless there are two reasons 1 inadequacy of datasets 2 noise in the measurements 25 the results of the gamma test are obtained based on the calculation of a statistical parameter named gamma the gamma statistic is calculated in a four step process at the first step datasets are defined as x i y i 1 i m where m is the number of datasets xi is the vector of independent variables and yi is the scalar of the dependent variable at the second step the kth nearest neighbors x n i k must be determined for each vector xi the value of k varies from 1 to p a number between 10 and 20 is usually a suitable choice for p at the third step the delta function for the vector of independent variables and the gamma function for the dependent variable scalar are computed according to eqs 1 and 2 respectively 25 26 28 1 δ m k 1 m i 1 m x n i k x i 2 1 k p 2 γ m k 1 2 m i 1 m y n i k y i 2 1 k p where represents the euclidean distance and y n i k is equal to the values of y corresponding to each of x n i k at the fourth step a linear regression model with the equation of γ aδ gt is fitted on the points p δm k γm k the parameters a and gt are the slope and the intercept of the regression line respectively gt represents the gamma statistic as long as the gamma statistic is small in relation to the variance of the dependent variable the dependent variable will be predictable by a smooth model of independent variables 29 the value of gamma statistic and consequently the modeling accuracy are sensitive to the number of datasets the increase in the number of datasets up to the minimum required number for modeling decreases the value of gamma statistic or increases the modeling accuracy but afterward the increase in the number of datasets have no noticeable effect on the value of gamma statistic and modeling accuracy 25 26 therefore to determine the minimum number of required datasets the graph of the gamma statistic is plotted against the number of datasets the number of datasets after which the graph is stabilized to an asymptote is the minimum required data to model the considered dependent variable in this study the gamma test was conducted using wingamma software to determine the optimal number of groundwater monitoring wells for kish island the latitude and longitude of 244 existing wells as independent variables and the monitoring priority score of wells as the dependent variable were considered 2 6 determining the optimal location of monitoring wells anessential step in the optimal design of gmn is to specify the optimal location of monitoring wells it should be mentioned that designers prefer to select monitoring wells among existing wells after generating a monitoring priority map existing wells can be assigned a number as a monitoring priority score provided monitoring wells are selected based on the monitoring priority score all wells will be located in highly vulnerable areas while no well is located in the vast areas whose monitoring priority score is less than the other areas therefore in addition to monitoring priority score the equitable distribution of the monitoring wells is essential 8 30 to consider the simultaneous effect of these two parameters and select wells from existing wells the flowchart shown in fig 5 can be applied at first the study area is divided into n sub areas on the basis of the monitoring priority score then the distribution factor x is defined as follows eq 3 for each sub area 3 x w a p where w is the number of required monitoring wells in each sub area a is the area of each sub area p is the mean monitoring priority score calculated for each sub area then as observed in eqs 4 and 5 the number of required monitoring wells in each sub area is calculated such that firstly the distribution factor is equal in all sub areas and secondly the total number of wells is equal to the minimum number of required monitoring wells computed by gamma test 4 w 1 a 1 p 1 w 2 a 2 p 2 w n a n p n 5 w 1 w 2 w n m i n i m u m n u m b e r o f r e q u i r e d m o n i t o r i n g w e l l s several states may be obtained in this process 1 if the number of required wells is equal to the number of existing wells in a sub area the existing wells will be selected as monitoring wells 2 if the number of required wells in a sub area is equal to 1 and more than one well exist a well with the highest monitoring priority score will be chosen as monitoring well 3 if the number of required wells is greater than the number of existing wells in a sub area in addition to selecting the existing wells as monitoring wells the required wells will be constructed in the sites whose monitoring priority score is higher than the others 4 if the number of required wells in a sub area is more than 1 and less than the number of existing wells this sub area will be divided into several sub areas and again the number of required wells will be calculated for each sub area 3 results and discussion 3 1 determining the vulnerability map to seawater intrusion for kish island a four step process was conducted to calculate the galdit index which is an indicator of coastal aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion at the first step six effective factors on the seawater intrusion risk were investigated for kish island the first effective factor in the galdit index is g based on the morphology of impermeable underground layer and permeability of the coastal strip the kish island s aquifer is divided into three types bounded aquifer unconfined and leaky unconfined the second factor is a based on the collected data from boreholes the aquifer permeability is less than 4 m d in most areas of kish island the third factor is l for this factor the average difference between groundwater and the sea level through three monitoring periods was specified for different points on kish island the fourth factor is d obviously the middle area and the coastal strip of the island have the least and most probability of seawater intrusion respectively the fifth factor is i for this factor the average water ec of wells in the coastal strips at a distance of less than 600 m from the shoreline was applied the sixth factor is t which was determined based on the morphology of the impermeable underground layer and average groundwater level in different parts of the island after identifying the galdit factors for kish island at the second step the values of each factor were scored between 1 lowest impact to 10 the highest impact based on the effect of different ranges of each factor on the seawater intrusion table 1 then the map of each factor was created based on the assigned scores fig 6 at the third step according to the kish island s conditions and considering the literature a weight was assigned to each factor table 2 these weights indicate the relative importance of the factors as shown in table 2 the l and d factors have the highest and g and i factors have the lowest weight finally the summation of weighted maps of the aforementioned effective factors was obtained as galdit index map for kish island fig 7 as seen in fig 7 the coastal strip and the center of the island generally have the highest and the lowest seawater intrusion risk respectively furthermore the seawater intrusion risk is high in the eastern and southeastern parts of the island 3 2 the priority map of groundwater salinity monitoring for kish island a three step process was conducted to determine the monitoring priority map for kish island at the first step the effect of f and p factors was identified for kish island based on the findings due to the lack of a centralized and comprehensive water supply system on kish island 13 industries including hotels entertainment and construction apply groundwater as the main source of water supply and feed water to their desalination plants these industries discharge saline effluent directly into the groundwater through shallow wells according to the field observations and mclin s 1986 study the adverse impact of these wells is maximum up to a radius of 200 m 31 for radial distances more than 200 m the adverse impact decreases the second effective factor in determining the priority of groundwater salinity monitoring is f to identify this factor the ec fluctuations through three monitoring periods were specified for different points on kish island at the second step the values of f and p factors were scored between 1 lowest impact to 10 the highest impact based on the effect of different ranges of each factor on the seawater intrusion table 3 then based on the assigned scores the map of each factor was created fig 8 at the third step the maps of galdit index f and p were combined to determine the priority map of groundwater salinity monitoring fig 9 shows the priority map of groundwater salinity monitoring for kish island as observed the monitoring priority in the eastern northwestern and southwestern part of the island is much greater than the other parts 3 3 determining the number of required wells using gamma test after generating the priority map of groundwater salinity monitoring for kish island all 244 existing wells were assigned a score for groundwater monitoring priority the latitude and longitude of all 244 existing wells as independent variables and their monitoring priority scores as dependent variable were considered then the gamma test was applied to determine the minimum number of required wells for groundwater salinity monitoring on kish island as shown in fig 10 the gamma statistic graph is approximately smoothed for datasets more than 110 therefore at least 110 wells must be monitored on kish island to achieve sufficient data to model the groundwater salinity of the whole island 3 4 optimal location of monitoring wells 3 4 1 selecting the location of monitoring wells using priority score after determining the minimum number of salinity monitoring wells 110 wells the optimal location of monitoring wells is needed to determine among existing wells so long as the monitoring wells are selected based on the highest priority scores the location of monitoring wells will be according to the green circles in fig 11 as observed the spatial distribution of monitoring wells is uneven and no monitoring well is located in the wide areas of the island with low priority score moreover in some northern areas of the island the density of the proposed wells is high and their distances are too low while monitoring can be performed with a less number of wells in those areas as a result the priority score alone is an inappropriate criterion to find the optimal location of monitoring wells 3 4 2 selecting the location of monitoring wells using distribution factor the proposed method in this study was applied to determine the optimal location of 110 monitoring wells among existing wells using the parameters of monitoring priority score and uniform distribution of monitoring wells simultaneously for this purpose kish island was first divided into five sub areas based on the monitoring priority score then the number of wells in each sub area was calculated such that the distribution factor is equal for all sub areas and the total number of monitoring wells is equal to 110 since the computed number of monitoring wells in each sub area was larger than one and less than the number of existing wells the process of dividing each sub area was continued until the exact location of the monitoring wells was determined fig 12 shows the optimal location of the monitoring wells with green triangles as seen proposed monitoring wells have a proper distribution on the whole island this proves the importance of such a planning protocol for effective environmental monitoring to show the necessity of using hydrogeological information along with gamma test in determining the optimal monitoring network the result of this study is compared with the result of ref 10 in which the gamma test alone was applied to determine the optimal monitoring network fig 13 shows the optimal groundwater monitoring network proposed by the gamma test alone as seen the proposed network does not have a good distribution throughout the island in the east south and a part of the north of the island a lack of monitoring wells is observed although gamma test can be a good method for the initial design of monitoring network in the absence of timely data and hydrogeological information its combination with the monitoring priority map and using the distribution factor is an efficient method for designing the monitoring network the proposed algorithm in this study is feasible to determine the optimal gmn among existing wells by considering the cumulative effects of industries human activities and natural factors on the groundwater quality not only for coastal areas but also for areas where a groundwater monitoring priority map is available 3 5 applicability of the method in industry damaging environmental impacts and the deterioration of groundwater resource associated with different industries is a significant problem on the one hand industries use a significant amount of groundwater in different processes such as cooling cleaning and facilitating waste discharge on the other hand extremely high water quality is required for some purposes in addition highly toxic wastewater with a high potential for contaminating groundwater resource is commonly produced therefore due to the extent of industrial activities considering preventative measure is vital to manage the adverse environmental impacts of industries based on the polluter pays principle a company causing environmental damage must implement appropriate preventative or remedial measures and cover all the related costs since the remediation of groundwater contamination is a long and costly process stakeholders prefers to take necessary measures to avoid the groundwater pollution in this regard groundwater monitoring is an effective management step that if optimally designed can identify potential adverse impacts of industrial activities at the lowest cost before leading to irreversible damage to the groundwater resource the method proposed in this study helps stakeholders to design an optimal groundwater monitoring network in and around their operations based on the geological and hydrodynamic parameters of area as well as damaging effects of desired industrial activities the main aim of this method is to present an optimal monitoring network consisting an adequate number of wells that are installed at optimal locations to achieve holistic and representative information about the quality of up and down gradient groundwater of the facilities 4 conclusions this paper which presents a practical approach to design the gmn solves two major researchers issues during the design of gmn including firstly the minimum number of required wells to monitor and secondly the optimal location of monitoring wells the method proposed in this paper was successfully applied for the optimal design of groundwater salinity monitoring network on kish island persian gulf for this purpose the monitoring priority map of the island was created based on the combination of three factors including f p and galdit index as a result the monitoring priority in the eastern northwestern and southwestern part of the island was much greater than the other parts then gamma test was applied to determine the minimum number of required wells for groundwater salinity monitoring on kish island based on the results at least 110 wells must be monitored on kish island to achieve sufficient data to model the groundwater salinity of the whole island finally a practical algorithm was applied to determine the optimal location of 110 monitoring wells among existing wells using the proposed method which considers the detrimental effects of industries human activities and natural factors on the groundwater quality optimal gmn could be designed for areas where initial data of aquifer hydrogeological characteristics and wells are available besides one could significantly reduce the high cost of monitoring programs and optimize the cost efficiency of the programs credit authorship contribution statement hamid amiri

described in section 2 6 2 2 study area kish island with more than 91 km2 area is an important tourist destination in the persian gulf region this island is located about 18 km off the southern coast of iran from 53 53 to 54 04 e and 26 29 to 26 35 n fig 2 persian gulf waters with total dissolved solids tds of about 40 g l surround the groundwater resource of kish island 14 geological formations and the topography of the bedrock surface cause underground waters to flow from the center to the shoreline of the island and the hydraulic connection of the aquifer and sea to change along the coastline fig 3 the geology of kish island consists of two main layers the upper layer with 1 10 4 mean hydraulic conductivity contains condensed sand along with traces of crushed coral and the bottom layer with 1 10 6 m s mean hydraulic conductivity contains clay with lenses of silt ataie ashtiani 2010 fig 4 b indicates the groundwater level in november 2009 the two aforementioned geological layers and the depth of one well in a cross section of kish island the thickness of the upper permeable layer decreases from the center of the island to the shores most of the seasonal precipitation penetrates into the upper permeable layer and stops at the boundary of the marl layer according to previous studies the groundwater lens on the island due to its proximity to the coastline is always affected by seawater intrusion the average depth of wells on kish island is 12 5 m and the average distance between the ground level and the water level of the wells was about 11 m on kish island more than 244 wells are in operation in various sectors such as irrigation and drinking so that total annual groundwater consumption was estimated at roughly 3 7 mcm yr in 2018 as the kish island is enclosed with persian gulf waters and the well density is high in the coastal strip increase in groundwater salinity due to the seawater intrusion is a significant environmental issue also more than 10 desalination plants discharge about 5500 m3 yr saline effluent with the electrical conductivity ec between 6200 and 97 000 μs cm into the aquifer of kish island although the kish island s groundwater is of great importance an optimal plan for groundwater salinity monitoring has yet to be established only in three sampling periods during 2009 2010 the water level and ec of some wells have been measured hence an optimal network for groundwater monitoring seems more and more necessary to design for kish island 2 3 determining the map of aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion one of the useful indicators to evaluate and quantify the vulnerability of the coastal aquifers to seawater intrusion is the galdit index 15 galdit index which was first developed by chachadi and lobo ferrerou 2001 considers the effect of six hydrogeological factors on seawater intrusion risk the first factor is g which has a significant effect on the boundary interface of saline water and freshwater in unconfined aquifers if the groundwater level is reduced by 1 m the boundary interface of saline water and freshwater will raise by about 40 m 16 since the cone of depression in a confined aquifer is larger than that of in an unconfined aquifer for the same pumping rate the vulnerability of confined aquifer to seawater intrusion is higher than that of unconfined aquifer 17 bounded aquifer is another type of aquifer whose recharge and or impervious boundary is parallel to the coast 18 19 the lowest risk of seawater intrusion is considered for this type of aquifer 18 the second factor is a which affects the shape of depression cone during pumping the more the hydraulic conductivity the wider the depression cone and consequently the more the vulnerability to seawater intrusion 20 tidal pumping a natural phenomenon occurring in coastal areas can exacerbate the seawater intrusion in regions with high hydraulic conductivity 21 the third effective factor is l which provides a hydraulic pressure against the seawater intrusion 22 the salinity intrusion risk is higher in areas where the groundwater level is lower than the sea level 17 ghyben herzberg showed that the height of the fresh groundwater column at each point is about 40 m per each meter of fresh groundwater above sea level 23 d is the fourth factor in galdit index obviously as the distance from the coastline decreases the aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion increases the fifth factor is i which provides a proper understanding of the current condition of the seawater intrusion chemical components of groundwater such as tds ec and major cations and anions are usually used as a sign of the seawater intrusion 17 the sixth effective factor is t the higher the saturation aquifer thickness the higher the salinity intrusion risk 24 the aquifer thickness depends on the physical and geological conditions of the bedrock calculating the galdit index is started by identifying the effect of each factor on seawater intrusion for the study area then the values of each factor are scored between 1 lowest impact to 10 maximum impact based on the effect of different ranges of each factor on the seawater intrusion afterward the map of each factor is created next a weight is assigned to each map based on the relative importance of each factor in seawater intrusion finally the vulnerability is mapped by overlaying the weighted map of the factors 2 4 determining the map of groundwater monitoring priority as mentioned before the galdit index only indicates aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion while the destructive effect of human activities and industries on groundwater salinity must be considered for the monitoring priority map hence two factors of f and p are considered as indicators for the effect of human activities and industries on groundwater salinity f factor represents the quantitative and qualitative changes of groundwater this parameter induces the effect of anthropogenic activities and natural aquifer recharge due to rainfall not only groundwater ec but also its fluctuation is important to determine groundwater monitoring priority without parameter f we cannot achieve a correct map of groundwater monitoring priority if in a place groundwater ec is low but ec fluctuation is high this place has to be prioritized for monitoring because it has the potential to be saline in the future besides as the value of the p factor decreases the priority of groundwater monitoring increases then the map of each factor is created the values in each map are scored between 1 lowest impact to 10 highest impact based on the effect of different ranges of each factor on the increase in groundwater salinity next the map of each factor is created finally the monitoring priority map is created by overlaying the map of f p and galdit index with equal weights 2 5 determining the minimum number of required monitoring wells using gamma test gamma test is an analytical tool and allows users to specify the minimum number of required datasets of independent variables to model a dependent variable directly from the datasets and before modeling 25 27 the primary assumption of gamma test is that the variation of the dependent variable for two considered datasets must be relative to the variation of independent variables unless there are two reasons 1 inadequacy of datasets 2 noise in the measurements 25 the results of the gamma test are obtained based on the calculation of a statistical parameter named gamma the gamma statistic is calculated in a four step process at the first step datasets are defined as x i y i 1 i m where m is the number of datasets xi is the vector of independent variables and yi is the scalar of the dependent variable at the second step the kth nearest neighbors x n i k must be determined for each vector xi the value of k varies from 1 to p a number between 10 and 20 is usually a suitable choice for p at the third step the delta function for the vector of independent variables and the gamma function for the dependent variable scalar are computed according to eqs 1 and 2 respectively 25 26 28 1 δ m k 1 m i 1 m x n i k x i 2 1 k p 2 γ m k 1 2 m i 1 m y n i k y i 2 1 k p where represents the euclidean distance and y n i k is equal to the values of y corresponding to each of x n i k at the fourth step a linear regression model with the equation of γ aδ gt is fitted on the points p δm k γm k the parameters a and gt are the slope and the intercept of the regression line respectively gt represents the gamma statistic as long as the gamma statistic is small in relation to the variance of the dependent variable the dependent variable will be predictable by a smooth model of independent variables 29 the value of gamma statistic and consequently the modeling accuracy are sensitive to the number of datasets the increase in the number of datasets up to the minimum required number for modeling decreases the value of gamma statistic or increases the modeling accuracy but afterward the increase in the number of datasets have no noticeable effect on the value of gamma statistic and modeling accuracy 25 26 therefore to determine the minimum number of required datasets the graph of the gamma statistic is plotted against the number of datasets the number of datasets after which the graph is stabilized to an asymptote is the minimum required data to model the considered dependent variable in this study the gamma test was conducted using wingamma software to determine the optimal number of groundwater monitoring wells for kish island the latitude and longitude of 244 existing wells as independent variables and the monitoring priority score of wells as the dependent variable were considered 2 6 determining the optimal location of monitoring wells anessential step in the optimal design of gmn is to specify the optimal location of monitoring wells it should be mentioned that designers prefer to select monitoring wells among existing wells after generating a monitoring priority map existing wells can be assigned a number as a monitoring priority score provided monitoring wells are selected based on the monitoring priority score all wells will be located in highly vulnerable areas while no well is located in the vast areas whose monitoring priority score is less than the other areas therefore in addition to monitoring priority score the equitable distribution of the monitoring wells is essential 8 30 to consider the simultaneous effect of these two parameters and select wells from existing wells the flowchart shown in fig 5 can be applied at first the study area is divided into n sub areas on the basis of the monitoring priority score then the distribution factor x is defined as follows eq 3 for each sub area 3 x w a p where w is the number of required monitoring wells in each sub area a is the area of each sub area p is the mean monitoring priority score calculated for each sub area then as observed in eqs 4 and 5 the number of required monitoring wells in each sub area is calculated such that firstly the distribution factor is equal in all sub areas and secondly the total number of wells is equal to the minimum number of required monitoring wells computed by gamma test 4 w 1 a 1 p 1 w 2 a 2 p 2 w n a n p n 5 w 1 w 2 w n m i n i m u m n u m b e r o f r e q u i r e d m o n i t o r i n g w e l l s several states may be obtained in this process 1 if the number of required wells is equal to the number of existing wells in a sub area the existing wells will be selected as monitoring wells 2 if the number of required wells in a sub area is equal to 1 and more than one well exist a well with the highest monitoring priority score will be chosen as monitoring well 3 if the number of required wells is greater than the number of existing wells in a sub area in addition to selecting the existing wells as monitoring wells the required wells will be constructed in the sites whose monitoring priority score is higher than the others 4 if the number of required wells in a sub area is more than 1 and less than the number of existing wells this sub area will be divided into several sub areas and again the number of required wells will be calculated for each sub area 3 results and discussion 3 1 determining the vulnerability map to seawater intrusion for kish island a four step process was conducted to calculate the galdit index which is an indicator of coastal aquifer vulnerability to seawater intrusion at the first step six effective factors on the seawater intrusion risk were investigated for kish island the first effective factor in the galdit index is g based on the morphology of impermeable underground layer and permeability of the coastal strip the kish island s aquifer is divided into three types bounded aquifer unconfined and leaky unconfined the second factor is a based on the collected data from boreholes the aquifer permeability is less than 4 m d in most areas of kish island the third factor is l for this factor the average difference between groundwater and the sea level through three monitoring periods was specified for different points on kish island the fourth factor is d obviously the middle area and the coastal strip of the island have the least and most probability of seawater intrusion respectively the fifth factor is i for this factor the average water ec of wells in the coastal strips at a distance of less than 600 m from the shoreline was applied the sixth factor is t which was determined based on the morphology of the impermeable underground layer and average groundwater level in different parts of the island after identifying the galdit factors for kish island at the second step the values of each factor were scored between 1 lowest impact to 10 the highest impact based on the effect of different ranges of each factor on the seawater intrusion table 1 then the map of each factor was created based on the assigned scores fig 6 at the third step according to the kish island s conditions and considering the literature a weight was assigned to each factor table 2 these weights indicate the relative importance of the factors as shown in table 2 the l and d factors have the highest and g and i factors have the lowest weight finally the summation of weighted maps of the aforementioned effective factors was obtained as galdit index map for kish island fig 7 as seen in fig 7 the coastal strip and the center of the island generally have the highest and the lowest seawater intrusion risk respectively furthermore the seawater intrusion risk is high in the eastern and southeastern parts of the island 3 2 the priority map of groundwater salinity monitoring for kish island a three step process was conducted to determine the monitoring priority map for kish island at the first step the effect of f and p factors was identified for kish island based on the findings due to the lack of a centralized and comprehensive water supply system on kish island 13 industries including hotels entertainment and construction apply groundwater as the main source of water supply and feed water to their desalination plants these industries discharge saline effluent directly into the groundwater through shallow wells according to the field observations and mclin s 1986 study the adverse impact of these wells is maximum up to a radius of 200 m 31 for radial distances more than 200 m the adverse impact decreases the second effective factor in determining the priority of groundwater salinity monitoring is f to identify this factor the ec fluctuations through three monitoring periods were specified for different points on kish island at the second step the values of f and p factors were scored between 1 lowest impact to 10 the highest impact based on the effect of different ranges of each factor on the seawater intrusion table 3 then based on the assigned scores the map of each factor was created fig 8 at the third step the maps of galdit index f and p were combined to determine the priority map of groundwater salinity monitoring fig 9 shows the priority map of groundwater salinity monitoring for kish island as observed the monitoring priority in the eastern northwestern and southwestern part of the island is much greater than the other parts 3 3 determining the number of required wells using gamma test after generating the priority map of groundwater salinity monitoring for kish island all 244 existing wells were assigned a score for groundwater monitoring priority the latitude and longitude of all 244 existing wells as independent variables and their monitoring priority scores as dependent variable were considered then the gamma test was applied to determine the minimum number of required wells for groundwater salinity monitoring on kish island as shown in fig 10 the gamma statistic graph is approximately smoothed for datasets more than 110 therefore at least 110 wells must be monitored on kish island to achieve sufficient data to model the groundwater salinity of the whole island 3 4 optimal location of monitoring wells 3 4 1 selecting the location of monitoring wells using priority score after determining the minimum number of salinity monitoring wells 110 wells the optimal location of monitoring wells is needed to determine among existing wells so long as the monitoring wells are selected based on the highest priority scores the location of monitoring wells will be according to the green circles in fig 11 as observed the spatial distribution of monitoring wells is uneven and no monitoring well is located in the wide areas of the island with low priority score moreover in some northern areas of the island the density of the proposed wells is high and their distances are too low while monitoring can be performed with a less number of wells in those areas as a result the priority score alone is an inappropriate criterion to find the optimal location of monitoring wells 3 4 2 selecting the location of monitoring wells using distribution factor the proposed method in this study was applied to determine the optimal location of 110 monitoring wells among existing wells using the parameters of monitoring priority score and uniform distribution of monitoring wells simultaneously for this purpose kish island was first divided into five sub areas based on the monitoring priority score then the number of wells in each sub area was calculated such that the distribution factor is equal for all sub areas and the total number of monitoring wells is equal to 110 since the computed number of monitoring wells in each sub area was larger than one and less than the number of existing wells the process of dividing each sub area was continued until the exact location of the monitoring wells was determined fig 12 shows the optimal location of the monitoring wells with green triangles as seen proposed monitoring wells have a proper distribution on the whole island this proves the importance of such a planning protocol for effective environmental monitoring to show the necessity of using hydrogeological information along with gamma test in determining the optimal monitoring network the result of this study is compared with the result of ref 10 in which the gamma test alone was applied to determine the optimal monitoring network fig 13 shows the optimal groundwater monitoring network proposed by the gamma test alone as seen the proposed network does not have a good distribution throughout the island in the east south and a part of the north of the island a lack of monitoring wells is observed although gamma test can be a good method for the initial design of monitoring network in the absence of timely data and hydrogeological information its combination with the monitoring priority map and using the distribution factor is an efficient method for designing the monitoring network the proposed algorithm in this study is feasible to determine the optimal gmn among existing wells by considering the cumulative effects of industries human activities and natural factors on the groundwater quality not only for coastal areas but also for areas where a groundwater monitoring priority map is available 3 5 applicability of the method in industry damaging environmental impacts and the deterioration of groundwater resource associated with different industries is a significant problem on the one hand industries use a significant amount of groundwater in different processes such as cooling cleaning and facilitating waste discharge on the other hand extremely high water quality is required for some purposes in addition highly toxic wastewater with a high potential for contaminating groundwater resource is commonly produced therefore due to the extent of industrial activities considering preventative measure is vital to manage the adverse environmental impacts of industries based on the polluter pays principle a company causing environmental damage must implement appropriate preventative or remedial measures and cover all the related costs since the remediation of groundwater contamination is a long and costly process stakeholders prefers to take necessary measures to avoid the groundwater pollution in this regard groundwater monitoring is an effective management step that if optimally designed can identify potential adverse impacts of industrial activities at the lowest cost before leading to irreversible damage to the groundwater resource the method proposed in this study helps stakeholders to design an optimal groundwater monitoring network in and around their operations based on the geological and hydrodynamic parameters of area as well as damaging effects of desired industrial activities the main aim of this method is to present an optimal monitoring network consisting an adequate number of wells that are installed at optimal locations to achieve holistic and representative information about the quality of up and down gradient groundwater of the facilities 4 conclusions this paper which presents a practical approach to design the gmn solves two major researchers issues during the design of gmn including firstly the minimum number of required wells to monitor and secondly the optimal location of monitoring wells the method proposed in this paper was successfully applied for the optimal design of groundwater salinity monitoring network on kish island persian gulf for this purpose the monitoring priority map of the island was created based on the combination of three factors including f p and galdit index as a result the monitoring priority in the eastern northwestern and southwestern part of the island was much greater than the other parts then gamma test was applied to determine the minimum number of required wells for groundwater salinity monitoring on kish island based on the results at least 110 wells must be monitored on kish island to achieve sufficient data to model the groundwater salinity of the whole island finally a practical algorithm was applied to determine the optimal location of 110 monitoring wells among existing wells using the proposed method which considers the detrimental effects of industries human activities and natural factors on the groundwater quality optimal gmn could be designed for areas where initial data of aquifer hydrogeological characteristics and wells are available besides one could significantly reduce the high cost of monitoring programs and optimize the cost efficiency of the programs credit authorship contribution statement hamid amiri

8766,poland has significant geothermal water resources and the study presents a list of 29 undeveloped but existing intakes of ready thermal waters with temperatures ranging from 21 to 86 c in this study important issues related to the hitherto unused intakes of geothermal waters will be discussed in a comprehensive manner a review has been made with regard to the location of geothermal water resources in poland where there are already wells but not yet exploited list of all undeveloped geothermal water intakes estimated calculations were made for 29 wells of thermal power mw and thermal energy gwh year and estimated exergy kj kg analysis for selected intakes in the context of air protection calculations were made related to the estimated reduction of harmful air pollutants if the geothermal intakes presented in the article were to be used presents the results for coagulation for water from a selected geothermal water intake from which it was possible to remove the total iron content from the water with high efficiency this is the proposed method of treating geothermal water supported by the results of the researcher s own research the thermal energy that these sources can generate amounts to a total of approximately 247 5 gwh year moreover this energy would allow to heat about 8250 single family houses covering a total area of 350 000 square meters the problem of geothermal water quality was discussed and the results were presented after it had been subjected to the coagulation process coagulation has been proposed as an effective method to remove undesirable compounds from geothermal water before it enters the installation a satisfactory total iron removal effect at the level of 99 was obtained thanks to the use of highly polymerized aluminum coagulants in combination with filtration keywords geothermal water intakes heating potential geothermal water resources 1 introduction geothermal energy is the earth s internal heat accumulated in rocks and in the waters filling pores and rock crevices geothermal energy is included in the category of renewable energy because its source the hot interior of the globe is practically inexhaustible typically hot thermal waters are found at considerable depths but in some places on earth especially in areas of increased volcanic activity e g in iceland hot water appears at relatively shallow depths or even comes to the surface of the earth in the form of hot springs geysers 1 thermal waters and the energy they contain have been the subject of special interest in poland for over 20 years related to the possibilities of their use for heating balneology and recreation it is very difficult to reliably define and document thermal water deposits and to arrive at decision on the means of their use development or the lack of such possibility over 7000 deep boreholes including research and scientific ones were made thanks to which the deep geological structure of poland was examined and the deposits of thermal waters were identified in poland there are rich deposits of thermal waters that are associated with three main tectonic units the western european palaeozoic platform and the sudetes and carpathians together with their foothills the areas of podhale have been identified to the extent that it is possible to determine deposit and design parameters many areas such as the sudetes still require exploration 2 3 poland is a country with a high demand for thermal energy alternative sources of energy both heat and electricity are sought after due to the need to protect the environment governments support investments in clean energy for the use of thermal water energy to be economically viable a detailed analysis of the geological and hydrogeological conditions of their occurrence should be performed it is also necessary to define the market of potential customers considering the features of thermal waters in poland it can be concluded that they have a very different temperature thus can be used in heating domestic hot water recreation balneology and perhaps in the future will also serve as a source of electricity 2 4 5 the parameters of geothermal water and the recipient s demand for heat predetermine the choice of a geothermal installation system the demand for heat both daily and annual can be variable mainly due to the seasons 6 therefore having such concept in mind it is worth properly designing a heat source with a set of transmission devices incorporated there are three basic types of geothermal systems to be taken into account considering the share of geothermal energy in satisfying heating needs the systems are either monovalent bivalent or combined 7 8 a characteristic feature of a monovalent system fig 1 is that the source of supply is only a geothermal heating plant the installed power in the source is adjusted to the highest heat demand at night calculated for the variable outside temperature in this scenario the installed capacity in the source is adapted to the maximum heat power demand resulting from the calculated outdoor temperature 9 this system due to the excess power beyond the peak load has a significant disadvantage consisting in the low use of the available power of the geothermal source which leads to an increase in the overall cost of acquired heat the decision upon using such a system is justified in case of high temperature of geothermal water approx 100 c and or descending use of thermal energy for various technological processes 10 as per the bivalent system it is used when the geothermal heating plant acts as the primary source supported by a peak boiler e g gas or oil only in the period of the highest heat demand such a system allows for better use of the available geothermal power throughout the whole heating period 11 indeed for most of the year the thermal needs are met by the geothermal heating plant and the system with the peak boiler is activated at isolated circumstances the latter being an existing old outdated boiler house fig 2 it should be noted that a bivalent system is more expensive than the monovalent one 10 12 the third combined system can be applied when the recipients are supplied by a geothermal heating plant low temperature heating and the rest of the heat demand is provided by a conventional boiler room traditional heating such combination makes it possible to use the power of geothermal source to a much greater extent and reduce the costs of heat production fig 3 the two systems are functioning only in the colder periods of the heating season outside of this term when conventional boilers are being shut down the geothermal heating plant takes over to supply the production of heat for heating and domestic hot water the basic elements of heating systems with the carrier as a connecting factor are central heat sources supplying heat to the system and the heating network this in turn performs the function of transporting heat from the source to heat nodes which consecutively mediate in the transfer of heat energy from network water into the installations of internal recipients additional elements of geothermal installations when compared to traditional heat plants are the heat exchangers heat pumps and possibly conventional boilers with either bivalent or combined systems heat exchangers can be described as those which exchange heat between geothermal and heating network water the necessity to use a heat exchanger between the two circulations results from the corrosive influence of geothermal waters on individual elements of the installation due to mineralization its direct use for heating purposes is not feasible inadvisable therefore heat exchangers used in geothermal installations are essentially made of titanium and its mixtures which significantly reduces the aggressive impact of geothermal waters on the construction materials the solutions for running transmission pipelines between the production well and heat exchangers correlate with its construction for conventional heating installations rotary pumps are an important element of the pipelines which allow used water to be pumped back into the bed forcing its flow between the heads of the production and absorption wells due to impurities fine rock particles impurities from the transmission pipeline of geothermal water it is filtered in front of the heat exchangers in order to protect the installation the filtering process is repeated downstream of the injection pumps to prevent the phenomenon of clogging silting of the aquifer sometimes filtration is not sufficient because the water can contain compounds that are difficult to remove and will quickly clog the filter therefore geothermal water should be treated with chemical methods e g coagulation before it reaches the filter 1 10 for the purposes of the article a literature search was carried out to determine the number of existing geothermal wells in poland which are not currently exploited so far there is no such statement in the literature then on the basis of the found data thermal power and thermat energy calculations were made and an exergetic analysis was carried out for geothermal intakes in the temperature range of 21 86 c additionally due to the high iron content in some intakes it was decided to conduct research on removing iron from geothermal water coagulation with polyaluminium chlorides was used as a method of iron removal the research results are presented as geothermal development is low carbon estimates of the annual reduction in gas emissions have been made 2 poland s exploitation resources according to a study by the pga polish geothermal association poland has rich deposits of thermal waters with temperatures of 27 125 c the areas with high geothermal potential are the areas of the polish lowlands and the region of the tunnel valley in poland geothermal energy is used mainly for recreational balneological and heating purposes in the areas of the polish lowlands it is possible to use water with a temperature even above 100 c and high efficiency of the source reaching even 300 m3 h corrosion of the geothermal installation may be a problem in some areas combined with a high tds total dissolved solids value sometimes even 300 g dm3 especially in the zone where salt diapirs occur the reservoirs are mainly made of sandstone locally also of carbonates the main geothermal water resources of the polish lowlands lie in the horizons of the mesozoic groundwater paleozoic aquifers are characterized by lower resource values 14 15 geothermal waters primarily accumulate in the lower jurassic and lower cretaceous formations but significant geothermal energy resources are also reserved in the upper jurassic middle jurassic upper triassic and lower triassic rocks the most interesting and promising areas are in warsaw mogilno łódzka in the central part of poland and szczecin in the north western part of the polish lowlands basin the use of thermal waters for heating purposes in individual voivodships and cities of central poland should be based primarily on the resources of the lower jurassic aquifer 16 17 the temperature field of the lower jurassic formation in the polish lowlands varies significantly from typical for subsurface waters outcrops direct regeneration zones to 120 c in the deep axial part of the łódz basin area to the north and north east of konin city in the warsaw łódź and szczecin basins temperatures exceed 50 c in most of the lower jurassic aquifer the potential discharge of the well exceeds 100 m3 h the largest discharges approx 300 450 m3 h are expected for the north eastern part of the łódź basin in szczecin warsaw and the rest of łódz basins as well as in the kujawy block the flow can be estimated to be around 250 350 m3 h the tds of lower jurassic groundwater ranges from a few to over 200 g dm3 in the axial parts of the basins the predicted thermal power of geothermal doublets results up to 30 50 mwth 2 the temperature depends largely on the depth of the aquifer in the north west part of the łódź basin konin area and in the north west part of the szczecin basin temperatures increase to over 50 c due to structural depressions occurring the central parts of those regions the highest temperatures of over 90 c were detected in the vicinity of konin therefore the prospective area where we shall find the lower cretaceous aquifer can be limited however it is likely to come across large discharges of potential wells of over 100 m3 h locally even over 300 m3 h moreover the tds values do not exceed 40 g dm3 18 19 the subsequent example of a region having a considerable hydro geothermal potential in poland is the area of podhale located specifically in the carpathian geothermal province podhale is in fact considered an area where we can find the best reservoir and exploitation properties of geothermal waters 3 the aquifer being presently exploited which is also the interest of prospective study lies within the limestones and dolomites of the middle triassic and the overlying middle eocene carbonates namely at depths of 1 3 7 km 15 18 those formations are found all over the area of podhale spreading over the territory of slovakia 20 the maximum temperatures of main aquifer reservoir that is at depth of 2 3 2 km can reach up to 90 95 c interestingly in the deeper parts of the system at a depth of 4 5 4 8 km the measured temperatures of the formation arrive at 120 128 c the rates of artesian flow from individual wells fluctuate from a few to 550 m3 h however the tds of geothermal waters range 0 1 3 2 g dm3 21 it is worth mentioning that in the region of podhale thermal waters are mainly used for heating purposes with the total power of the geothermal heating system being approx 40 8 mwth nonetheless the total installed capacity of the heating plant can be even 80 5 mwth 21 the adoption of geothermal energy in the remaining areas of the carpathians is rather unlikely and narrowed to limited areas the carpathian foredeep geothermal province is estimated to have a smaller geothermal potential as evidenced by the numerous boreholes made in these regions smaller resources of about 20 m3 h and lower temperatures determine the use of these waters more for recreational and balneological purposes rather than for heating an exception is the cenomanian aquifer as throughout its range we may find large discharges of up to 250 m3 h groundwater temperatures in cenomania reservoirs vary widely from 30 to 100 c the best reservoir parameters of cenomanian sandstones have developed in the central part of the carpathian foredeep 14 22 in the sudeten geothermal region south western poland the waters occur specifically in the crystalline formations of the mountains at the moment the waters of this region are being utilized in several localities mainly for balneotherapy 4 23 in the areas with outstanding hydro geothermal conditions we have indicated main structures for the use of binary technologies 18 the region which results to be the most promising for the use of hydro geothermal energy including electricity production is the podhale whereas when considering the polish lowlands the best opportunities for the use of geothermal waters in binary systems are found in its central part esentially in the konin area where the temperature of water accumulated in the lower jurassic reservoir exceeds 90 c 24 due to the occurrence of geothermal anomalies the sudetes region appears to be a suitable place to locate binary system in this area specifically in cieplice water at a temperature of 86 7 c is being collected at a depth of 2002 5 m 25 as of december 31 2018 there are 135 thermal curative and brine water deposits in poland additionally the total amount of approved exploitation resources of all intakes results to be 5984 thousand m3 h aforementioned information in details can be found in the below table thermal waters occur below the surface of 80 of poland s territory see table 1 fig 4 presents temperature defined holes in poland at a depth of 1500 m the main constraints exploitation of sources result from extraction conditions primarily due to the economic angle of such operation presently there are six municipal geothermal heating plants in poland table 2 in the last three years three local geothermal heating systems were additionally put into operation in order to supply individual public buildings with heat in addition thermal waters are used in 19 recreation centers 12 geothermal spas one salt works and one fish farm 27 28 the most important factors affecting the efficiency of geothermal chp operation come down to hydrogeological parameters i e water temperature mineralization resource height reservoir pressure and depth of occurrence out of the above criteria temperature and fertility are the most important 16 3 list of undeveloped wells in poland and the benefits of using them for the purpose of this study a detailed analysis of the unused and yet undeveloped existing thermal water intakes was prepared by authors 31 32 for the 29 well locations the data has been systematized by the following the name of the well the type of intake water mineralization in the source water temperature at the outflow from the deposit and intake efficiency see table 3 5 then the calculations were done considering thermal power qg thermal energy qr number of heated homes per year and area of heated objects 27 the study presents all calculations and gives examples of geothermal installations that could be made with this type of resources presently however the intakes do not serve any purpose which is essentially due to the lack of funds and investors to engage on the project 31 3 1 thermal parameters calculations the study of all 29 underdeveloped geothermal wells resulted in estimating thermal power and energy that a geothermal heating boiler station can produce the following was required for such estimation mass m of the water from the deposit temperature t1 of the water from the intake bore and temperature t2 of the return water pumped into the absorbent hole exchangeable for a retention tank in case of unavailability for the sake of the calculation it was assumed that the temperature of the return water for all intakes is precisely 20 c another assumption was that heat efficiency of the geothermal sources is being assessed when treating them as the lower heat source for the heat pumps the factors insignificant to the study concern heat losses during the transfer as well as the method for receiving heat from the source therefore the formula for calculating heat

the annual demand d for thermal energy for a detached house with a useable area of approximately 150 m2 is 30 mwh thus the heating boiler station will be able to supply sufficient amount of heat based on the equation 3 s q r d 1220 therefore the described heating boiler station can provide heating for 1220 detached houses assuming that the demand for heat in buildings with normal thermal insulation is at a level of 80 w m2 one could state that the power in the above mentioned heating boiler station will supply heat to facilities with an area n of over 52 km 2 as per below 4 n p a 52238 m 2 amidst 29 undeveloped intakes eight were selected that present the highest thermal energy qr gwh year namely solely the eight most abundant ones give a thermal power qg total of 221 1 gwh year while the sum for all 29 sources is 247 4 gwh year this indicates that eight intakes represent 89 of thermal energy of all investigated resources when examining those 8 most significant intakes we arrive at a calculation that 7371 houses with a total area of 315 526 m2 can be heated while considering all 29 would accordingly allow for heating of 8246 houses with a total area of 353 009 m2 fig 5 shows the annual thermal efficiency of 8 selected geothermal water intakes with the highest qr thermal potential the increasing demand for primary energy due to economic development and population growth on earth causes the depletion of conventional energy resources such as fossil fuels however what poses greater threat to humanity is not the depletion of natural resources of conventional fuels but the global contamination of natural environment with products of their combustion dust sulfur oxides nitrogen and carbon without introducing remedial measures consisting in saving energy replacing traditional carriers with more environmentally friendly ones it will be difficult to stop the further degradation of the world around us 3 2 estimation of the annual gas emissions table 4 presents annual emission at a detached house with approx 150 m2 of living space in which the energy standard is about 90 kwh m2 year and has thermal insulation for selected fuels 5 33 34 according to the estimation the thermal energy supply for 1220 houses from furmanowa will result in co2 emissions decrease by 7666 t year as juxtaposed with emissions from coal fired heating houses and by 15060 t of co2 year for houses heated by natural gas as presented in table 5 it is very difficult to imagine the huge amounts of co2 and other gaseous pollutants that end up in the air we breathe unfortunately with the current calculation of the average way of life on earth we would need at least 2 5 globe to survive 3 3 exergy analysis exergy concept can be defined as the maximum work amount obtainable from a system when it is an equilibrium condition with the environment this definition is one of the most useful concepts in analyzing energy systems applying this definition makes it possible to assess the quantity and quality of energy flows of a system an exergy balance equation for an energy system could be written as follows 35 5 m e x i e q i e w i m e x e e q e e w e e d here m is mass flow rate kg s ex is specific exergy kj kg e refers to exergy rate kw also subscripts i e q w and d refer to inlet exit heat work and destruction respectively based on different exergy aspects it is divided into four different types kinetic potential chemical and physical in this study just physical exergy has been considered and others are considered insignificant the specific exergy can be calculated as below 35 6 e x p h k h h 0 k t 0 s s 0 k h h o t is the excess of the specific enthalpy of thermal water over its value at the ambient temperature tot s s o t is the excess of water specific entropy over its value at ambient temperature however the exergy can be written 7 e m e x the exergy assessment has been done for all case studies to compare the inlet flow potential of each geofluid case coming from production wells the values of exergy and specific exergy for all cases are presented in table 6 according to the exergy calculations mrówki zawadka poronin łabędź and furmanowa have the highest specific exergy values respectively however the highest value of exergy is related to mrówki furmanowa poronin łabędź and zawadka in order as the mass flow rate has a direct impact on exergy value then it can be found that it had significant impact on exergy values 3 4 geothermal water treatment methods the energy of geothermal waters can be used in heating and domestic hot water installations in individual installations for recreational and balneological purposes and in agriculture among others for heating greenhouses crops and soil 36 other applications of geothermal waters are fish and algae breeding drying and pasteurization melting snow and ice from pavements and roadways as well as heating airport runways geothermal waters have a rich composition and can be the basis for the production of medications and cosmetics they can recover co2 nacl and other chemicals often geothermal water is fit for consumption and can be used as drinking water pores fractures fissures and faults in the earth s crust also contain geothermal waters in poland geothermal or thermal waters are characterized by a temperature above 20 c before using the water for various purposes geothermal water should be purified 23 37 the coagulation process consists in adding a coagulant to water which removes undesirable compounds it is commonly used for the removal of colloids and suspensions the most frequently used coagulants are iron and aluminum compounds it is very important to choose a coagulant that will achieve the desired cleansing effect at the lowest dose 38 40 high coagulation efficiency allows to reduce the need for oxidizing or disinfecting agents thermal water is highly varied in composition due to its contact with rocks and minerals and usually has high salinity it is required to treat such water before it ends up in a heat exchanger or other geothermal installation one of the compounds that undoubtedly needs to be removed are iron compounds most often occurring as bicarbonates or sulfates depending on the forms of its occurrence aeration liming coagulation and filtration can be applied iron particles occur at the level of colloidal fragmentation and the destabilization of such a system often occurs only by adding chemical coagulants 13 41 3 4 1 water coagulation for selected intakes due to the need to purify geothermal waters tests were carried out on the effectiveness of reducing the iron content in geothermal water from a selected water intake the tests were carried out on water from an undeveloped water intake in wołczyn viia number 23 on the map in fig 3 coagulation was carried out using pre hydrolyzed aluminum coagulants known under the trade names flokor 1 2a and flokor dm17h in doses of 20 and 50 g m3 and flokor dm17h at a dose of 30 g m3 the temperature in the intake was 37 c the ionic analysis was carried out and the coagulant additive was evaluated according to its impact on the ionic content of water in accordance with pourbaix s graph i e the graph of potential ph for the iron compounds the solid forms of iron occur when the medium reaches ph values of 7 the tests performed for the model waters with increased salinity and temperatures indicate that the applied coagulants accrue the highest effectiveness levels de ironing within the ph range of 7 9 8 1 42 43 considering that the water sample had a ph 6 51 it was essential to increase the ph level up to the required range five series of tests were carried out which allowed for obtaining five results for each trial it means that each point on the graph is the arithmetic mean of five measurement results fig 6 presents the results related to the effectiveness of reducing iron and manganese from geothermal water from the wołczyn water intake the results are presented for raw water and water subjected to coagulation with two coagulants in different doses the amendment of ph was generated with the use of 0 1 m naoh wołczyn intake water was yellowish brown in color with 1000 mg pt dm3 thereby it shall become less intensive moreover it included an increased amount of total iron i e 66 2 mg dm3 it can be noticed that in the raw water decantated after sedimentation for 30 min the total iron content is much lower about 1 4 mg dm3 it can be noticed that both coagulants combined with filtration ensure iron reduction 0 005 mg dm3 however when taking into account the complexity of iron manganese removal and color reduction the addition of flokor 1 2a at a dose of 50 g m3 provided the best results the content of mn decreased from 1 13 mg dm3 raw water filtrate to 1 0 mg dm3 the iron content decreased from 0 8 mg dm3 raw filtrate to 0 005 mg dm3 color from 94 mg pt dm3 raw filtrate dropped to 22 mg pt dm3 the results are satisfactory for reducing the iron content by 99 3 manganese by 11 5 and the color by 76 5 raw compared to flokor 1 2a at a dose of 50 g m3 4 discussion the adopted method of utilization of the used cooled thermal waters to a large extent influences the amount of investment and operational expenditure related to the activity of the thermal plant are injection wells according to the polish market rates the drilling cost at about 2000 below sea level amounts to approximately pln 12 14 million 44 therefore out of 28 geothermal plants in poland in operation only seven have thermal water forced into the rock mass additionally another factor determining high operating costs related to the operation of salted thermal water in a closed system would be corrosion and clogging of the geothermal installation problems related to the absorbency of wells and deposits often require the implementation of costly repair procedures even with temporary shutdown of the well from exploitation the costs of one off technical operations to improve the absorptivity of deep geothermal wells are estimated at approx 200 250 thousand at geothermal plants operating in an open system the water used is discharged into surface watercourses or to the sewage system which generates other environmental costs 25 45 as per the principle of rational deposit management it is one of the basic factors that should not determine the amount of exploited thermal water resources and the means of operation the injection of used thermal waters into the rock mass is a practice that has been used in the world since the seventies of the last century and is considered the most optimal hydrodynamic and environmental method of utilization of cooled waters it ensures the renewable resources and the stability of the deposit parameters however this goal can be achieved on the condition that the highest possible values of basic hydrogeological parameters porosity permeability are available for absorptive purposes most importantly as the ratio between the production capacity and the absorptive capacity of the wells is 1 0 4 0 6 on average 1 15 24 many years of polish industrial experience related to the injection of water into carbonate collectors indicate that this process usually does not encounter any major operational difficulties although it is largely dependent on the chemical composition and physical properties of water what is more difficult is the injection of water into the pore structures usually of sandstone nature limited rock absorptivity with high salinity of thermal waters usually determines the efficiency of the entire geothermal system and thus also the amount of renewable energy obtained in geothermal plants extracting relatively low saline water up to several g dm3 albeit with high efficiency several dozen or even several hundred m3 h and in recreational facilities and balneological facilities exploiting resources at low efficiency up to several m3 h the system of exploitation of the deposit resources is usually open the used water is discharged into the surface watercourse based on a water permit or discharged to the sewage system it is the simplest and most certainly the cheapest solution to the problem of water utilization although not always beneficial in the context of sustainable management of groundwater and surface water resources especially that thermal waters apart from increased salinity often contain elevated concentrations of microelements incl boron barium strontium fluorides bromides and heavy metals 17 28 the conditions to be met when discharging sewage into waters or into the ground and on substances particularly harmful to the water environment item as well as the ordinance of the minister of the environment on the requirements relate to inland waters being the environment of fish life in natural conditions and the requirements resulting from fees for the use of the environment increased water salinity and the content of inter alia boron barium strontium fluorides and metal bromides often determine limitations in this scope 15 24 28 the possibility of direct use of thermal waters for the production of drinking or economic water is strictly dependent on the physical properties and chemical composition of the water waters with mineralization below 1000 mg dm3 usually succeed to meet the requirements for drinking waters depending on the turbidity and content of organic substances the water may be subject to possible coagulation or microfiltration ultrafiltration and filtration on multilayer beds and disinfection before being directed to the water supply network 15 the deficit of ordinary waters in many regions of the world means that desalination and the use of thermal waters are more and more often perceived as a beneficial way of securing high quality water for drinking purposes irrigation of crops and at the same time limiting the negative impact resulting from the discharge of the waters into surface watercourses 46 47 the method of utilizing the extracted and cooled water is a complex problem requiring detailed considerations in the field of reservoir engineering and environmental conditions considering economic aspects practical implementation of specific geological and environmental solutions and frequently encountering environmental and often legal limitations in recent years there has been a significant increase in the extraction and use of geothermal waters for heating and balneological purposes in poland the main problem with the use of geothermal water is the cost of water extraction and the cost of the installation economic problems can be reduced thanks to numerous government and european subsidies for clean energy geothermal energy is a developing sector in poland which is why in this study a comprehensive summary of information on poland s possibilities of managing thermal waters has been prepared 48 the profitability of an investment depends on many factors which are presented in fig 7 5 conclusions poland has at least 29 wells that can be put into production existing intakes have temperatures in the range of 21 86 c which classifies them as thermal waters that could be used in binary combined installations and above all as a lower source of a heat pump thermal energy for these intakes amounts to a total of about 247 gwh year which would allow for annual heating of over 2800 single family houses with a cubature of 150 m3 the use of thermal water as a heat source would reduce harmful gases at the level of 51 811 t co2 year 30593 kg co year 82 46 kg pm2 5 10 year 824 63 kg so2 year and 22429 kg nox year compared to the gas boiler and 101775 71 t co2 year 4190599 kg co year compared to the coal kiln additionally the proposed method of coagulation as a method of purifying thermal water before installation is very effective and can certainly be used for this purpose it should be noted that the reduction of iron content results by 99 3 manganese by 11 5 and the color by 76 5 raw compared to flokor 1 2a at a dose of 50 g m3 according to the exergy calculations mrówki zawadka poronin łabędź and furmanowa have the highest specific exergy values while the highest value of exergy is related to mrówki furmanowa poronin łabędź and zawadka investments in new energy sources in the world should

8766,poland has significant geothermal water resources and the study presents a list of 29 undeveloped but existing intakes of ready thermal waters with temperatures ranging from 21 to 86 c in this study important issues related to the hitherto unused intakes of geothermal waters will be discussed in a comprehensive manner a review has been made with regard to the location of geothermal water resources in poland where there are already wells but not yet exploited list of all undeveloped geothermal water intakes estimated calculations were made for 29 wells of thermal power mw and thermal energy gwh year and estimated exergy kj kg analysis for selected intakes in the context of air protection calculations were made related to the estimated reduction of harmful air pollutants if the geothermal intakes presented in the article were to be used presents the results for coagulation for water from a selected geothermal water intake from which it was possible to remove the total iron content from the water with high efficiency this is the proposed method of treating geothermal water supported by the results of the researcher s own research the thermal energy that these sources can generate amounts to a total of approximately 247 5 gwh year moreover this energy would allow to heat about 8250 single family houses covering a total area of 350 000 square meters the problem of geothermal water quality was discussed and the results were presented after it had been subjected to the coagulation process coagulation has been proposed as an effective method to remove undesirable compounds from geothermal water before it enters the installation a satisfactory total iron removal effect at the level of 99 was obtained thanks to the use of highly polymerized aluminum coagulants in combination with filtration keywords geothermal water intakes heating potential geothermal water resources 1 introduction geothermal energy is the earth s internal heat accumulated in rocks and in the waters filling pores and rock crevices geothermal energy is included in the category of renewable energy because its source the hot interior of the globe is practically inexhaustible typically hot thermal waters are found at considerable depths but in some places on earth especially in areas of increased volcanic activity e g in iceland hot water appears at relatively shallow depths or even comes to the surface of the earth in the form of hot springs geysers 1 thermal waters and the energy they contain have been the subject of special interest in poland for over 20 years related to the possibilities of their use for heating balneology and recreation it is very difficult to reliably define and document thermal water deposits and to arrive at decision on the means of their use development or the lack of such possibility over 7000 deep boreholes including research and scientific ones were made thanks to which the deep geological structure of poland was examined and the deposits of thermal waters were identified in poland there are rich deposits of thermal waters that are associated with three main tectonic units the western european palaeozoic platform and the sudetes and carpathians together with their foothills the areas of podhale have been identified to the extent that it is possible to determine deposit and design parameters many areas such as the sudetes still require exploration 2 3 poland is a country with a high demand for thermal energy alternative sources of energy both heat and electricity are sought after due to the need to protect the environment governments support investments in clean energy for the use of thermal water energy to be economically viable a detailed analysis of the geological and hydrogeological conditions of their occurrence should be performed it is also necessary to define the market of potential customers considering the features of thermal waters in poland it can be concluded that they have a very different temperature thus can be used in heating domestic hot water recreation balneology and perhaps in the future will also serve as a source of electricity 2 4 5 the parameters of geothermal water and the recipient s demand for heat predetermine the choice of a geothermal installation system the demand for heat both daily and annual can be variable mainly due to the seasons 6 therefore having such concept in mind it is worth properly designing a heat source with a set of transmission devices incorporated there are three basic types of geothermal systems to be taken into account considering the share of geothermal energy in satisfying heating needs the systems are either monovalent bivalent or combined 7 8 a characteristic feature of a monovalent system fig 1 is that the source of supply is only a geothermal heating plant the installed power in the source is adjusted to the highest heat demand at night calculated for the variable outside temperature in this scenario the installed capacity in the source is adapted to the maximum heat power demand resulting from the calculated outdoor temperature 9 this system due to the excess power beyond the peak load has a significant disadvantage consisting in the low use of the available power of the geothermal source which leads to an increase in the overall cost of acquired heat the decision upon using such a system is justified in case of high temperature of geothermal water approx 100 c and or descending use of thermal energy for various technological processes 10 as per the bivalent system it is used when the geothermal heating plant acts as the primary source supported by a peak boiler e g gas or oil only in the period of the highest heat demand such a system allows for better use of the available geothermal power throughout the whole heating period 11 indeed for most of the year the thermal needs are met by the geothermal heating plant and the system with the peak boiler is activated at isolated circumstances the latter being an existing old outdated boiler house fig 2 it should be noted that a bivalent system is more expensive than the monovalent one 10 12 the third combined system can be applied when the recipients are supplied by a geothermal heating plant low temperature heating and the rest of the heat demand is provided by a conventional boiler room traditional heating such combination makes it possible to use the power of geothermal source to a much greater extent and reduce the costs of heat production fig 3 the two systems are functioning only in the colder periods of the heating season outside of this term when conventional boilers are being shut down the geothermal heating plant takes over to supply the production of heat for heating and domestic hot water the basic elements of heating systems with the carrier as a connecting factor are central heat sources supplying heat to the system and the heating network this in turn performs the function of transporting heat from the source to heat nodes which consecutively mediate in the transfer of heat energy from network water into the installations of internal recipients additional elements of geothermal installations when compared to traditional heat plants are the heat exchangers heat pumps and possibly conventional boilers with either bivalent or combined systems heat exchangers can be described as those which exchange heat between geothermal and heating network water the necessity to use a heat exchanger between the two circulations results from the corrosive influence of geothermal waters on individual elements of the installation due to mineralization its direct use for heating purposes is not feasible inadvisable therefore heat exchangers used in geothermal installations are essentially made of titanium and its mixtures which significantly reduces the aggressive impact of geothermal waters on the construction materials the solutions for running transmission pipelines between the production well and heat exchangers correlate with its construction for conventional heating installations rotary pumps are an important element of the pipelines which allow used water to be pumped back into the bed forcing its flow between the heads of the production and absorption wells due to impurities fine rock particles impurities from the transmission pipeline of geothermal water it is filtered in front of the heat exchangers in order to protect the installation the filtering process is repeated downstream of the injection pumps to prevent the phenomenon of clogging silting of the aquifer sometimes filtration is not sufficient because the water can contain compounds that are difficult to remove and will quickly clog the filter therefore geothermal water should be treated with chemical methods e g coagulation before it reaches the filter 1 10 for the purposes of the article a literature search was carried out to determine the number of existing geothermal wells in poland which are not currently exploited so far there is no such statement in the literature then on the basis of the found data thermal power and thermat energy calculations were made and an exergetic analysis was carried out for geothermal intakes in the temperature range of 21 86 c additionally due to the high iron content in some intakes it was decided to conduct research on removing iron from geothermal water coagulation with polyaluminium chlorides was used as a method of iron removal the research results are presented as geothermal development is low carbon estimates of the annual reduction in gas emissions have been made 2 poland s exploitation resources according to a study by the pga polish geothermal association poland has rich deposits of thermal waters with temperatures of 27 125 c the areas with high geothermal potential are the areas of the polish lowlands and the region of the tunnel valley in poland geothermal energy is used mainly for recreational balneological and heating purposes in the areas of the polish lowlands it is possible to use water with a temperature even above 100 c and high efficiency of the source reaching even 300 m3 h corrosion of the geothermal installation may be a problem in some areas combined with a high tds total dissolved solids value sometimes even 300 g dm3 especially in the zone where salt diapirs occur the reservoirs are mainly made of sandstone locally also of carbonates the main geothermal water resources of the polish lowlands lie in the horizons of the mesozoic groundwater paleozoic aquifers are characterized by lower resource values 14 15 geothermal waters primarily accumulate in the lower jurassic and lower cretaceous formations but significant geothermal energy resources are also reserved in the upper jurassic middle jurassic upper triassic and lower triassic rocks the most interesting and promising areas are in warsaw mogilno łódzka in the central part of poland and szczecin in the north western part of the polish lowlands basin the use of thermal waters for heating purposes in individual voivodships and cities of central poland should be based primarily on the resources of the lower jurassic aquifer 16 17 the temperature field of the lower jurassic formation in the polish lowlands varies significantly from typical for subsurface waters outcrops direct regeneration zones to 120 c in the deep axial part of the łódz basin area to the north and north east of konin city in the warsaw łódź and szczecin basins temperatures exceed 50 c in most of the lower jurassic aquifer the potential discharge of the well exceeds 100 m3 h the largest discharges approx 300 450 m3 h are expected for the north eastern part of the łódź basin in szczecin warsaw and the rest of łódz basins as well as in the kujawy block the flow can be estimated to be around 250 350 m3 h the tds of lower jurassic groundwater ranges from a few to over 200 g dm3 in the axial parts of the basins the predicted thermal power of geothermal doublets results up to 30 50 mwth 2 the temperature depends largely on the depth of the aquifer in the north west part of the łódź basin konin area and in the north west part of the szczecin basin temperatures increase to over 50 c due to structural depressions occurring the central parts of those regions the highest temperatures of over 90 c were detected in the vicinity of konin therefore the prospective area where we shall find the lower cretaceous aquifer can be limited however it is likely to come across large discharges of potential wells of over 100 m3 h locally even over 300 m3 h moreover the tds values do not exceed 40 g dm3 18 19 the subsequent example of a region having a considerable hydro geothermal potential in poland is the area of podhale located specifically in the carpathian geothermal province podhale is in fact considered an area where we can find the best reservoir and exploitation properties of geothermal waters 3 the aquifer being presently exploited which is also the interest of prospective study lies within the limestones and dolomites of the middle triassic and the overlying middle eocene carbonates namely at depths of 1 3 7 km 15 18 those formations are found all over the area of podhale spreading over the territory of slovakia 20 the maximum temperatures of main aquifer reservoir that is at depth of 2 3 2 km can reach up to 90 95 c interestingly in the deeper parts of the system at a depth of 4 5 4 8 km the measured temperatures of the formation arrive at 120 128 c the rates of artesian flow from individual wells fluctuate from a few to 550 m3 h however the tds of geothermal waters range 0 1 3 2 g dm3 21 it is worth mentioning that in the region of podhale thermal waters are mainly used for heating purposes with the total power of the geothermal heating system being approx 40 8 mwth nonetheless the total installed capacity of the heating plant can be even 80 5 mwth 21 the adoption of geothermal energy in the remaining areas of the carpathians is rather unlikely and narrowed to limited areas the carpathian foredeep geothermal province is estimated to have a smaller geothermal potential as evidenced by the numerous boreholes made in these regions smaller resources of about 20 m3 h and lower temperatures determine the use of these waters more for recreational and balneological purposes rather than for heating an exception is the cenomanian aquifer as throughout its range we may find large discharges of up to 250 m3 h groundwater temperatures in cenomania reservoirs vary widely from 30 to 100 c the best reservoir parameters of cenomanian sandstones have developed in the central part of the carpathian foredeep 14 22 in the sudeten geothermal region south western poland the waters occur specifically in the crystalline formations of the mountains at the moment the waters of this region are being utilized in several localities mainly for balneotherapy 4 23 in the areas with outstanding hydro geothermal conditions we have indicated main structures for the use of binary technologies 18 the region which results to be the most promising for the use of hydro geothermal energy including electricity production is the podhale whereas when considering the polish lowlands the best opportunities for the use of geothermal waters in binary systems are found in its central part esentially in the konin area where the temperature of water accumulated in the lower jurassic reservoir exceeds 90 c 24 due to the occurrence of geothermal anomalies the sudetes region appears to be a suitable place to locate binary system in this area specifically in cieplice water at a temperature of 86 7 c is being collected at a depth of 2002 5 m 25 as of december 31 2018 there are 135 thermal curative and brine water deposits in poland additionally the total amount of approved exploitation resources of all intakes results to be 5984 thousand m3 h aforementioned information in details can be found in the below table thermal waters occur below the surface of 80 of poland s territory see table 1 fig 4 presents temperature defined holes in poland at a depth of 1500 m the main constraints exploitation of sources result from extraction conditions primarily due to the economic angle of such operation presently there are six municipal geothermal heating plants in poland table 2 in the last three years three local geothermal heating systems were additionally put into operation in order to supply individual public buildings with heat in addition thermal waters are used in 19 recreation centers 12 geothermal spas one salt works and one fish farm 27 28 the most important factors affecting the efficiency of geothermal chp operation come down to hydrogeological parameters i e water temperature mineralization resource height reservoir pressure and depth of occurrence out of the above criteria temperature and fertility are the most important 16 3 list of undeveloped wells in poland and the benefits of using them for the purpose of this study a detailed analysis of the unused and yet undeveloped existing thermal water intakes was prepared by authors 31 32 for the 29 well locations the data has been systematized by the following the name of the well the type of intake water mineralization in the source water temperature at the outflow from the deposit and intake efficiency see table 3 5 then the calculations were done considering thermal power qg thermal energy qr number of heated homes per year and area of heated objects 27 the study presents all calculations and gives examples of geothermal installations that could be made with this type of resources presently however the intakes do not serve any purpose which is essentially due to the lack of funds and investors to engage on the project 31 3 1 thermal parameters calculations the study of all 29 underdeveloped geothermal wells resulted in estimating thermal power and energy that a geothermal heating boiler station can produce the following was required for such estimation mass m of the water from the deposit temperature t1 of the water from the intake bore and temperature t2 of the return water pumped into the absorbent hole exchangeable for a retention tank in case of unavailability for the sake of the calculation it was assumed that the temperature of the return water for all intakes is precisely 20 c another assumption was that heat efficiency of the geothermal sources is being assessed when treating them as the lower heat source for the heat pumps the factors insignificant to the study concern heat losses during the transfer as well as the method for receiving heat from the source therefore the formula for calculating heat power is the following 1 q g m c p δ t where q g thermal power w m mass flow of flowing water kg s c p average specific heat of water j kgk t 1 t 2 designed supply and return temperatures k 3 1 1

the annual demand d for thermal energy for a detached house with a useable area of approximately 150 m2 is 30 mwh thus the heating boiler station will be able to supply sufficient amount of heat based on the equation 3 s q r d 1220 therefore the described heating boiler station can provide heating for 1220 detached houses assuming that the demand for heat in buildings with normal thermal insulation is at a level of 80 w m2 one could state that the power in the above mentioned heating boiler station will supply heat to facilities with an area n of over 52 km 2 as per below 4 n p a 52238 m 2 amidst 29 undeveloped intakes eight were selected that present the highest thermal energy qr gwh year namely solely the eight most abundant ones give a thermal power qg total of 221 1 gwh year while the sum for all 29 sources is 247 4 gwh year this indicates that eight intakes represent 89 of thermal energy of all investigated resources when examining those 8 most significant intakes we arrive at a calculation that 7371 houses with a total area of 315 526 m2 can be heated while considering all 29 would accordingly allow for heating of 8246 houses with a total area of 353 009 m2 fig 5 shows the annual thermal efficiency of 8 selected geothermal water intakes with the highest qr thermal potential the increasing demand for primary energy due to economic development and population growth on earth causes the depletion of conventional energy resources such as fossil fuels however what poses greater threat to humanity is not the depletion of natural resources of conventional fuels but the global contamination of natural environment with products of their combustion dust sulfur oxides nitrogen and carbon without introducing remedial measures consisting in saving energy replacing traditional carriers with more environmentally friendly ones it will be difficult to stop the further degradation of the world around us 3 2 estimation of the annual gas emissions table 4 presents annual emission at a detached house with approx 150 m2 of living space in which the energy standard is about 90 kwh m2 year and has thermal insulation for selected fuels 5 33 34 according to the estimation the thermal energy supply for 1220 houses from furmanowa will result in co2 emissions decrease by 7666 t year as juxtaposed with emissions from coal fired heating houses and by 15060 t of co2 year for houses heated by natural gas as presented in table 5 it is very difficult to imagine the huge amounts of co2 and other gaseous pollutants that end up in the air we breathe unfortunately with the current calculation of the average way of life on earth we would need at least 2 5 globe to survive 3 3 exergy analysis exergy concept can be defined as the maximum work amount obtainable from a system when it is an equilibrium condition with the environment this definition is one of the most useful concepts in analyzing energy systems applying this definition makes it possible to assess the quantity and quality of energy flows of a system an exergy balance equation for an energy system could be written as follows 35 5 m e x i e q i e w i m e x e e q e e w e e d here m is mass flow rate kg s ex is specific exergy kj kg e refers to exergy rate kw also subscripts i e q w and d refer to inlet exit heat work and destruction respectively based on different exergy aspects it is divided into four different types kinetic potential chemical and physical in this study just physical exergy has been considered and others are considered insignificant the specific exergy can be calculated as below 35 6 e x p h k h h 0 k t 0 s s 0 k h h o t is the excess of the specific enthalpy of thermal water over its value at the ambient temperature tot s s o t is the excess of water specific entropy over its value at ambient temperature however the exergy can be written 7 e m e x the exergy assessment has been done for all case studies to compare the inlet flow potential of each geofluid case coming from production wells the values of exergy and specific exergy for all cases are presented in table 6 according to the exergy calculations mrówki zawadka poronin łabędź and furmanowa have the highest specific exergy values respectively however the highest value of exergy is related to mrówki furmanowa poronin łabędź and zawadka in order as the mass flow rate has a direct impact on exergy value then it can be found that it had significant impact on exergy values 3 4 geothermal water treatment methods the energy of geothermal waters can be used in heating and domestic hot water installations in individual installations for recreational and balneological purposes and in agriculture among others for heating greenhouses crops and soil 36 other applications of geothermal waters are fish and algae breeding drying and pasteurization melting snow and ice from pavements and roadways as well as heating airport runways geothermal waters have a rich composition and can be the basis for the production of medications and cosmetics they can recover co2 nacl and other chemicals often geothermal water is fit for consumption and can be used as drinking water pores fractures fissures and faults in the earth s crust also contain geothermal waters in poland geothermal or thermal waters are characterized by a temperature above 20 c before using the water for various purposes geothermal water should be purified 23 37 the coagulation process consists in adding a coagulant to water which removes undesirable compounds it is commonly used for the removal of colloids and suspensions the most frequently used coagulants are iron and aluminum compounds it is very important to choose a coagulant that will achieve the desired cleansing effect at the lowest dose 38 40 high coagulation efficiency allows to reduce the need for oxidizing or disinfecting agents thermal water is highly varied in composition due to its contact with rocks and minerals and usually has high salinity it is required to treat such water before it ends up in a heat exchanger or other geothermal installation one of the compounds that undoubtedly needs to be removed are iron compounds most often occurring as bicarbonates or sulfates depending on the forms of its occurrence aeration liming coagulation and filtration can be applied iron particles occur at the level of colloidal fragmentation and the destabilization of such a system often occurs only by adding chemical coagulants 13 41 3 4 1 water coagulation for selected intakes due to the need to purify geothermal waters tests were carried out on the effectiveness of reducing the iron content in geothermal water from a selected water intake the tests were carried out on water from an undeveloped water intake in wołczyn viia number 23 on the map in fig 3 coagulation was carried out using pre hydrolyzed aluminum coagulants known under the trade names flokor 1 2a and flokor dm17h in doses of 20 and 50 g m3 and flokor dm17h at a dose of 30 g m3 the temperature in the intake was 37 c the ionic analysis was carried out and the coagulant additive was evaluated according to its impact on the ionic content of water in accordance with pourbaix s graph i e the graph of potential ph for the iron compounds the solid forms of iron occur when the medium reaches ph values of 7 the tests performed for the model waters with increased salinity and temperatures indicate that the applied coagulants accrue the highest effectiveness levels de ironing within the ph range of 7 9 8 1 42 43 considering that the water sample had a ph 6 51 it was essential to increase the ph level up to the required range five series of tests were carried out which allowed for obtaining five results for each trial it means that each point on the graph is the arithmetic mean of five measurement results fig 6 presents the results related to the effectiveness of reducing iron and manganese from geothermal water from the wołczyn water intake the results are presented for raw water and water subjected to coagulation with two coagulants in different doses the amendment of ph was generated with the use of 0 1 m naoh wołczyn intake water was yellowish brown in color with 1000 mg pt dm3 thereby it shall become less intensive moreover it included an increased amount of total iron i e 66 2 mg dm3 it can be noticed that in the raw water decantated after sedimentation for 30 min the total iron content is much lower about 1 4 mg dm3 it can be noticed that both coagulants combined with filtration ensure iron reduction 0 005 mg dm3 however when taking into account the complexity of iron manganese removal and color reduction the addition of flokor 1 2a at a dose of 50 g m3 provided the best results the content of mn decreased from 1 13 mg dm3 raw water filtrate to 1 0 mg dm3 the iron content decreased from 0 8 mg dm3 raw filtrate to 0 005 mg dm3 color from 94 mg pt dm3 raw filtrate dropped to 22 mg pt dm3 the results are satisfactory for reducing the iron content by 99 3 manganese by 11 5 and the color by 76 5 raw compared to flokor 1 2a at a dose of 50 g m3 4 discussion the adopted method of utilization of the used cooled thermal waters to a large extent influences the amount of investment and operational expenditure related to the activity of the thermal plant are injection wells according to the polish market rates the drilling cost at about 2000 below sea level amounts to approximately pln 12 14 million 44 therefore out of 28 geothermal plants in poland in operation only seven have thermal water forced into the rock mass additionally another factor determining high operating costs related to the operation of salted thermal water in a closed system would be corrosion and clogging of the geothermal installation problems related to the absorbency of wells and deposits often require the implementation of costly repair procedures even with temporary shutdown of the well from exploitation the costs of one off technical operations to improve the absorptivity of deep geothermal wells are estimated at approx 200 250 thousand at geothermal plants operating in an open system the water used is discharged into surface watercourses or to the sewage system which generates other environmental costs 25 45 as per the principle of rational deposit management it is one of the basic factors that should not determine the amount of exploited thermal water resources and the means of operation the injection of used thermal waters into the rock mass is a practice that has been used in the world since the seventies of the last century and is considered the most optimal hydrodynamic and environmental method of utilization of cooled waters it ensures the renewable resources and the stability of the deposit parameters however this goal can be achieved on the condition that the highest possible values of basic hydrogeological parameters porosity permeability are available for absorptive purposes most importantly as the ratio between the production capacity and the absorptive capacity of the wells is 1 0 4 0 6 on average 1 15 24 many years of polish industrial experience related to the injection of water into carbonate collectors indicate that this process usually does not encounter any major operational difficulties although it is largely dependent on the chemical composition and physical properties of water what is more difficult is the injection of water into the pore structures usually of sandstone nature limited rock absorptivity with high salinity of thermal waters usually determines the efficiency of the entire geothermal system and thus also the amount of renewable energy obtained in geothermal plants extracting relatively low saline water up to several g dm3 albeit with high efficiency several dozen or even several hundred m3 h and in recreational facilities and balneological facilities exploiting resources at low efficiency up to several m3 h the system of exploitation of the deposit resources is usually open the used water is discharged into the surface watercourse based on a water permit or discharged to the sewage system it is the simplest and most certainly the cheapest solution to the problem of water utilization although not always beneficial in the context of sustainable management of groundwater and surface water resources especially that thermal waters apart from increased salinity often contain elevated concentrations of microelements incl boron barium strontium fluorides bromides and heavy metals 17 28 the conditions to be met when discharging sewage into waters or into the ground and on substances particularly harmful to the water environment item as well as the ordinance of the minister of the environment on the requirements relate to inland waters being the environment of fish life in natural conditions and the requirements resulting from fees for the use of the environment increased water salinity and the content of inter alia boron barium strontium fluorides and metal bromides often determine limitations in this scope 15 24 28 the possibility of direct use of thermal waters for the production of drinking or economic water is strictly dependent on the physical properties and chemical composition of the water waters with mineralization below 1000 mg dm3 usually succeed to meet the requirements for drinking waters depending on the turbidity and content of organic substances the water may be subject to possible coagulation or microfiltration ultrafiltration and filtration on multilayer beds and disinfection before being directed to the water supply network 15 the deficit of ordinary waters in many regions of the world means that desalination and the use of thermal waters are more and more often perceived as a beneficial way of securing high quality water for drinking purposes irrigation of crops and at the same time limiting the negative impact resulting from the discharge of the waters into surface watercourses 46 47 the method of utilizing the extracted and cooled water is a complex problem requiring detailed considerations in the field of reservoir engineering and environmental conditions considering economic aspects practical implementation of specific geological and environmental solutions and frequently encountering environmental and often legal limitations in recent years there has been a significant increase in the extraction and use of geothermal waters for heating and balneological purposes in poland the main problem with the use of geothermal water is the cost of water extraction and the cost of the installation economic problems can be reduced thanks to numerous government and european subsidies for clean energy geothermal energy is a developing sector in poland which is why in this study a comprehensive summary of information on poland s possibilities of managing thermal waters has been prepared 48 the profitability of an investment depends on many factors which are presented in fig 7 5 conclusions poland has at least 29 wells that can be put into production existing intakes have temperatures in the range of 21 86 c which classifies them as thermal waters that could be used in binary combined installations and above all as a lower source of a heat pump thermal energy for these intakes amounts to a total of about 247 gwh year which would allow for annual heating of over 2800 single family houses with a cubature of 150 m3 the use of thermal water as a heat source would reduce harmful gases at the level of 51 811 t co2 year 30593 kg co year 82 46 kg pm2 5 10 year 824 63 kg so2 year and 22429 kg nox year compared to the gas boiler and 101775 71 t co2 year 4190599 kg co year compared to the coal kiln additionally the proposed method of coagulation as a method of purifying thermal water before installation is very effective and can certainly be used for this purpose it should be noted that the reduction of iron content results by 99 3 manganese by 11 5 and the color by 76 5 raw compared to flokor 1 2a at a dose of 50 g m3 according to the exergy calculations mrówki zawadka poronin łabędź and furmanowa have the highest specific exergy values while the highest value of exergy is related to mrówki furmanowa poronin łabędź and zawadka investments in new energy sources in the world should

8767,textile industry is one of the major water consuming sectors therefore developing methods for reusing water is essential processes including reverse osmosis ro have gained momentum recently and been widely used however concentrated streams brine generated from ro must be managed properly in this study a pilot scale brine treatment system containing ozone oxidation nanofiltration nf ro and ion exchange iex was developed and operated to recover a high quality process water and salt solution to be reused in dyeing processes it was revealed that 77 of the water and 66 of the salt solution as nacl can be recovered and brine discharge can be reduced with full scale operation for one year it is possible to achieve cost savings by 176 256 usd with 115 000 m3 reused water and by 37 000 usd with 680 tons of recovered nacl recovery of brine makes it possible to achieve sustainable production and zero liquid discharge concepts graphical abstract image 1 keywords ro brine treatment salt recovery textile brine textile wastewater zero liquid discharge water recovery 1 introduction water is an indispensable natural resource for all organisms and most of the water needs are met from freshwater resources 1 as known with the population growth and accordingly the significant increase in water demand for both domestic consumption and agricultural and industrial applications may lead to a rapid depletion of water resources unfortunately this may cause water scarcity in the future 2 3 moreover water security is one of the sustainable development goals sdgs of the united nations necessary actions such as minimizing water use and water pollution as well as improving industrial processes to allow reuse of treated wastewater would serve this goal 4 as the increases in industrial water consumption and industrial wastewater generation have become a significant environmental problem the recycling and reuse of wastewater is an important phenomenon for the protection of water resources 5 6 textile industry is one of the industries with high water consumption on average 230 270 tons of water is used to produce 1 ton of textile material 7 according to the world bank report approximately 20 of the wastewater from industries originates from the textile industry 8 among the processes of the textile industry water and chemicals are consumed most in the wet processing finishing 9 in addition to many different chemicals a significant amount of salt and dyestuff are used in these processes the wastewater from the finishing process contains mainly metals organic matters toxic substances and surfactants 10 11 this wastewater is usually rich in color chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolved solids tds and salinity the dyeing process which is operated under wet processing accounts for more than 80 of the total wastewater generation 7 9 due to the use of high amounts of water in textile processes the wastewater of the textile industry must be treated and reused effectively 4 9 10 however the recycled wastewater quality parameters may vary depending on the processes applied in a textile mill for example iron in bleaching hardness in dyeing and color in washing processes are crucial parameters 12 reusability of recycled wastewater in a textile process is one of the key issues focused 4 12 14 membrane processes including reverse osmosis ro have been remarkable and promising technologies for water recovery and reuse 15 17 they have been widely used to treat industrial wastewaters including the wastewater of textile industry to remove impurities such as color cod and salt 18 20 despite some advantages concentrated stream brine resulting from membrane processes has become a significant environmental challenge to be managed brine can cause significant environmental problems if discharged to the environment due to its high concentrations of salt organic matter and other substances therefore the disposal management of brine has been one of the top concerns in recent years 21 brine has traditionally been managed through sewage discharge deep well injection ocean sea discharge and evaporation ponds recently these practices have become untenable due to environmental risks stricter discharge standards high management costs 22 23 and the emerging of innovative concepts such as recovery potential of valuable substances from brine streams 24 it is also of high importance to prevent discharges of brine streams for implementing zero liquid discharge zld approach 23 25 countries have employed varying methods for the management of ro concentrates depending on national legislations or regional situations turkey has no regulations on concentrate management yet some enterprises tackle this problem by either diverting concentrated streams to inlets of wastewater treatment plants wwtp or discharging them into sewers if any however these methods often cause negative effects such as salinization and chemical contamination in the receiving bodies in the long term moreover accumulation of salts in treatment plants may decrease treatment efficiency in the long run the recovery of salts such as nacl and na2so4 from ro brine and the reuse of them in textile production would be an innovative circular economy approach there are many studies on the treatment of textile industry wastewater by nanofiltration nf and ro 9 26 however the number of studies on the recovery of valuable substances or salt solutions from brine streams resulting from such processes is quite few as an example yuzer et al 12 revealed that the nf applied brine could be reused in dyeing processes after applying some treatment methods such as softening this study aimed to recover high quality water and salt solution from the ro brine of a textile mill currently the wastewater of textile mill is treated with conventional processes including physicochemical and biological methods then ultrafiltration uf and ro processes are applied to obtain a reusable water at full scale the ro process led to the generation of a highly concentrated and polluted brine stream the pilot scale brine treatment system used in this study was equipped with ozone oxidation nf ro and iex units the recovered salt solution mainly included sodium chloride and sodium sulfate the treatment performance of the pilot scale system was assessed in terms of permeate production and reusability of the produced salt solution in dyeing processes of the textile mill moreover expected environmental impacts of the brine treatment system were estimated to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study in the literature on the recovery and reuse of textile ro brine at pilot scale 2 methods 2 1 textile mill the subject integrated textile mill is located in luleburgaz kirklareli turkey the company mainly produces polyester yarn and cotton home textiles it consumes an average of 6000 m3 day groundwater for processes household uses and other needs cleaning gardening etc an average of 5000 m3 day wastewater is treated in a wwtp installed in the company site to satisfy discharge standards by physicochemical and biological treatment following the conventional treatment approximately 60 of the treated wastewater was subjected to advanced treatment which consisted of uf and ro processes for water recovery fig 1 as part of the study the retentate brine generated by ro was treated in a pilot scale treatment system 2 2 pilot system the textile pilot system tps for brine treatment was operated for about six months fig 2 shows the scheme of the process applied for water and salt recovery from ro brine the pilot scale plant had a capacity of 2 4 m3 day the tps consisted of pre treatment concentration and softening stages the pre treatment stage was basically applied to remove impurities such as color cod sulfate and total hardness th in the ro brine influent of tps and included an ozone oxidation unit and a two stage nf unit an ro unit was installed to concentrate the pre treated brine a cationic iex column was used to obtain a softened product stream all units of the tps were operated in batch mode for each unit 24 samples were collected from the feed permeate and concentrate streams of the membrane processes and their average impurity concentrations were determined ozone oxidation was employed to oxidize at least partially organic residues and to remove color the oxidation system consisted of an ozone tank 750 l an ozone generator an activated carbon and an ultraviolet light uv unit the use of the activated carbon and uv units aimed to remove the residual ozone and to protect the membranes the ozone oxidation system was operated with a contact time of 3 h and the ozone dosage applied to the treated water was 0 4 g o3 l as the main target was to produce salt solutions mainly rich in monovalent salts which could be reused in dyeing processes initially nanofiltration 1 nf1 was employed to separate monovalent ions such as na and cl from divalent ions such as mg2 and ca2 also it was aimed to eliminate such impurities as color cod sulfate and total hardness rejection at the maximum level in this context although there are many studies in literature testing many nf membranes such as nf270 dow filmtec usa 27 29 nf90 dow filmtec usa 16 29 and trisep ts40 30 to separate divalent ions from monovalent ions in this study nfg synder filtration usa membrane was chosen based on the preliminary lab scale experiments nfg is a much less common membrane because of the moderate divalent ion rejection efficiency however it provides a higher level of monovalent ion passage into permeate table 1 based on design calculations a two stage nf configuration was run where each stage consisted of two pressure vessels with two membrane elements at each in this way nf1 was operated with an 80 water recovery rate under 10 bar operating pressure the rejected stream of the nf1 process was subjected to nanofiltration 2 nf2 to obtain additional monovalent ion passage a single stage nf configuration was run in the nf2 which consisted of one pressure vessel with two membrane elements the nf2 was operated with an 80 recovery rate under 10 20 bar operating pressure the nf1 and nf2 permeate streams which were rich in monovalent ions were subjected to ro processes in order to further develop the concentration of the nf permeates and to obtain a reusable concentrated salt solution all the tests targeted a high water recovery rate the membrane properties and operating conditions of the membrane units in tps are given in table 1 the system recovery rate was determined using the following equation 1 1 r v p v f x 100 where r v p and v f stand for the recovery rate permeate volume at the end of operation and feed volume at the beginning of the operation cycle respectively the recovery rate of the ro process was targeted to be 80 and the operating pressure ranged from 20 to 30 bars the concentrate stream of the ro unit was connected to a cationic iex column to allow the exchange of excess hardness cations ca2 and mg2 the volume of the wet resin column was approximately 150 l and filled with dowex hcr s s resin the regeneration of this resin was achieved principally with 10 nacl solution however during the tps operation since the resin did not reach exhausted regeneration was not performed removal efficiencies of the all monitored parameters were calculated using the following equation 2 2 r e i c f i c p i c f i x 100 where re i c p i and c f i stand for the removal efficiency of the parameter i the permeate concentration of the parameter i and the feed concentration of the parameter i respectively the overall input flow rate of the tps per operation cycle was set to 750l h cycle the ozone oxidation nf1 nf2 ro and iex processes were operated in feed tank volumes of 750 l 750 l 150 l 723 l and 145 l respectively 2 3 analytical methods cod th turbidity nitrogen compounds alkalinity and color were determined with standard methods 31 heavy metals were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms perkinelmer nexion 300xx icp ms ph conductivity total dissolved solids tds and salinity were determined using a hach hq40d portable multi meter sulfate chloride and phosphate were analyzed with an ion chromatography device dionex ics 1000 equipped with an as9 hc column 3 results discussions 3 1 characterization of full scale ro brine the characteristics of ro brine from industrial wastewaters might be quite different from brackish water and seawater brines main parameters such as tds cod color total hardness and so4 2 in the ro brine of the examined mill are given table 2 the results reveal that the ro brine generally contains high amounts of alkalinity hardness total nitrogen chloride sulfate and organics in addition to tds the data indicate no significant fluctuations in the ro brine many studies on the characterization of textile ro brine in the literature reveal similar results 32 however depending on textile processes the composition of ro brine may vary the average tds concentration in the ro brine was 5 9 g l during the operation textile wastewaters typically contain salt because salt is used in the dyeing process for fabric fixation 33 color values were generally found to be around 100 pt co the average cod th and alkalinity concentrations were 201 mg l 211 mg l and 2 436 mg l respectively the ro brine characterization revealed no significant oscillation in any of the parameters because the ro brine was generally a composite stream 3 2 performance of pilot scale brine treatment system performance of the pilot system was evaluated in terms of pre treatment and concentrate softening stages the pretreatment stage was assessed with the performances of the ozone and nf systems and the concentrate softening stage with the performances of the ro and iex systems the performances of the membranes were evaluated by analyzing the parameters of the permeate and concentrate streams 3 2 1 pre treatment stage ozonation process caused a significant reduction in the color and cod concentrations however it revealed no significant changes in the other parameters while the nf1 and nf2 permeates were rich in monovalent ions such as na and cl the retentate was rich in divalent ions such as ca2 and mg2 as well as color cod sulfate hardness and other salts the only waste stream of the tps was the highly concentrated nf2 retentate the pretreatment process results are given in table 3 the ozone oxidation on the effluent allowed a cod elimination of 74 and a color removal of 93 the cod and color concentrations in the effluent were on average 42 mg l and 7 pt co respectively the results were compared with the values of the literature in which ozone oxidation was applied directly on raw textile wastewater and it was found that cod and color removal rates were almost similar 34 35 at the nf1 unit the average tds rejection efficiency rate was found to be 16 letting 84 of the salts to pass to the permeate as desired moreover divalent ions and some other parameters revealed moderate rejection efficiency rates the average cod sulfate and th rejection rates were 31 50 and 39 respectively figure 3 the rejection efficiencies were also found to be in compliance with the manufacturer s data indicating a rejection rate of 50 for the mgso4 in the nfg since most of the color was removed by the ozonation process the nf1 permeate color remained below the detection limits similarly the cod rejection efficiency was found to be low in nf1 and an average of 31 mg l cod was detected in the nf1 permeate as shown in figure 3 fluctuations were observed in cod and color parameters this may be explained by the variations in production processes affecting organic material types and concentrations thus the color of wastewaters the nf1 was operated with a recovery rate of 80 with no significant scaling during the operation the nf2 revealed an average tds rejection efficiency of 39 the average rates of cod sulfate and th rejection were 52 53 and 60 respectively figure 4 due to precipitation and partial clogging of the pores the pore sizes and filtration efficiencies of the membranes decreased leading to a higher rejection of the ions the loss of pressure in the both nfs from the feed to the concentrate streams ranged from 1 to 2 bars the rejections of monovalent and divalent ions in the nfs are presented in figure 3 and figure 4 regarding the nf1 chloride rejection ranged between 10 and 24 averaging at 17 and sodium rejection oscillated between 10 and 32 averaging at 19 while a significant portion of the monovalent ions passed to the nf1 permeate ca2 and mg2 were moderately rejected by the nf while monovalent ions revealed higher oscillations in rejection with a standard deviation of 22 31 divalent ions revealed lower oscillations with a standard deviation of 8 11 these findings indicated that monovalent ions were rejected more than divalent ions under these feed water quality and operating conditions average ca2 and mg2 rejection rates were around 40 and 38 respectively the nf2 also revealed similar results as it was aimed to recover the highest amount of monovalent salts from the permeate of the nfs the adverse effects of divalent ions like ca2 and mg2 from the permeate of the nfs on the final product was mitigated by applying an iex process 3 2 2 concentration and softening stage the concentration step by ro process aimed to increase the tds concentration in the nf1 and nf2 permeates in order to reuse the salt solution in dyeing processes average tds rejection rate was found to be 97 throughout the experimental operation the ro membranes rejected 96 98 of the monovalent ions na and cl the average ca2 mg2 so4 2 and th rejection rates were found to be 94 96 99 and 94 respectively as expected fig 5 the monovalent ions of the ro feed were more concentrated by around 3 3 5 times table 4 although the desired monovalent ion concentration was reached to the targeted value the hardness concentration an undesired pollutant for dyeing processes 12 increased to 810 mg caco3 l on the other hand the ro permeate had a very good quality for reuse in any process in a textile mill the loss of pressure in the ro from the feed to the concentrate stream ranged from 1 to 2 bars therefore there was no need for chemical cleaning of the membranes during the operation dyeing processes in the textile industry require soft water the dyeing process in the examined textile mill required the salt solution to have a hardness less than 3 4 f on the other hand the limits for the quality parameters of the water to be used in dyeing processes have not been clearly specified so far 12 hardness in the pilot scale ro brine was further decreased from 810 to 41 mg caco3 l by operating a cationic iex process table 4 the detailed results of the tps operation are outlined in fig 6 the tps operation has three outputs i the ro permeate to be used for various processes in textile mill ii the iex effluent stream to be reused in dyeing processes and iii the nf2 retentate which is the only waste stream of the tps the nf2 retentate constitutes approximately 4 of the total input stream volume of the tps the recovered salt solution revealed an average hardness of 41 mg caco3 l about 4 french hardness indicating reusability in dyeing processes by mixing with softened groundwater it was observed that the examined textile mill generally used salt concentrations ranging from 10 to 60 g l in its dyeing process since the average tds concentration of the brine generated by the tps ro was 16 g l the recovered salt solution could be used in the dyeing processes however the recovered salt solution contained moderate rates of cod and color these parameters could cause problems in various dyeing processes and further studies are needed on such problems 3 2 3 environmental savings potential of the brine treatment system for textile mill significant amounts of water and salt solution were recovered from the brine of the textile mill ro unit which could be useful in dyeing processes considering the feed flow and tds concentration the recovery rates were determined with the following equation 3 in terms of the nacl of the tps 3 r s a l t q e f f l u e n t x t d s

8767,textile industry is one of the major water consuming sectors therefore developing methods for reusing water is essential processes including reverse osmosis ro have gained momentum recently and been widely used however concentrated streams brine generated from ro must be managed properly in this study a pilot scale brine treatment system containing ozone oxidation nanofiltration nf ro and ion exchange iex was developed and operated to recover a high quality process water and salt solution to be reused in dyeing processes it was revealed that 77 of the water and 66 of the salt solution as nacl can be recovered and brine discharge can be reduced with full scale operation for one year it is possible to achieve cost savings by 176 256 usd with 115 000 m3 reused water and by 37 000 usd with 680 tons of recovered nacl recovery of brine makes it possible to achieve sustainable production and zero liquid discharge concepts graphical abstract image 1 keywords ro brine treatment salt recovery textile brine textile wastewater zero liquid discharge water recovery 1 introduction water is an indispensable natural resource for all organisms and most of the water needs are met from freshwater resources 1 as known with the population growth and accordingly the significant increase in water demand for both domestic consumption and agricultural and industrial applications may lead to a rapid depletion of water resources unfortunately this may cause water scarcity in the future 2 3 moreover water security is one of the sustainable development goals sdgs of the united nations necessary actions such as minimizing water use and water pollution as well as improving industrial processes to allow reuse of treated wastewater would serve this goal 4 as the increases in industrial water consumption and industrial wastewater generation have become a significant environmental problem the recycling and reuse of wastewater is an important phenomenon for the protection of water resources 5 6 textile industry is one of the industries with high water consumption on average 230 270 tons of water is used to produce 1 ton of textile material 7 according to the world bank report approximately 20 of the wastewater from industries originates from the textile industry 8 among the processes of the textile industry water and chemicals are consumed most in the wet processing finishing 9 in addition to many different chemicals a significant amount of salt and dyestuff are used in these processes the wastewater from the finishing process contains mainly metals organic matters toxic substances and surfactants 10 11 this wastewater is usually rich in color chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolved solids tds and salinity the dyeing process which is operated under wet processing accounts for more than 80 of the total wastewater generation 7 9 due to the use of high amounts of water in textile processes the wastewater of the textile industry must be treated and reused effectively 4 9 10 however the recycled wastewater quality parameters may vary depending on the processes applied in a textile mill for example iron in bleaching hardness in dyeing and color in washing processes are crucial parameters 12 reusability of recycled wastewater in a textile process is one of the key issues focused 4 12 14 membrane processes including reverse osmosis ro have been remarkable and promising technologies for water recovery and reuse 15 17 they have been widely used to treat industrial wastewaters including the wastewater of textile industry to remove impurities such as color cod and salt 18 20 despite some advantages concentrated stream brine resulting from membrane processes has become a significant environmental challenge to be managed brine can cause significant environmental problems if discharged to the environment due to its high concentrations of salt organic matter and other substances therefore the disposal management of brine has been one of the top concerns in recent years 21 brine has traditionally been managed through sewage discharge deep well injection ocean sea discharge and evaporation ponds recently these practices have become untenable due to environmental risks stricter discharge standards high management costs 22 23 and the emerging of innovative concepts such as recovery potential of valuable substances from brine streams 24 it is also of high importance to prevent discharges of brine streams for implementing zero liquid discharge zld approach 23 25 countries have employed varying methods for the management of ro concentrates depending on national legislations or regional situations turkey has no regulations on concentrate management yet some enterprises tackle this problem by either diverting concentrated streams to inlets of wastewater treatment plants wwtp or discharging them into sewers if any however these methods often cause negative effects such as salinization and chemical contamination in the receiving bodies in the long term moreover accumulation of salts in treatment plants may decrease treatment efficiency in the long run the recovery of salts such as nacl and na2so4 from ro brine and the reuse of them in textile production would be an innovative circular economy approach there are many studies on the treatment of textile industry wastewater by nanofiltration nf and ro 9 26 however the number of studies on the recovery of valuable substances or salt solutions from brine streams resulting from such processes is quite few as an example yuzer et al 12 revealed that the nf applied brine could be reused in dyeing processes after applying some treatment methods such as softening this study aimed to recover high quality water and salt solution from the ro brine of a textile mill currently the wastewater of textile mill is treated with conventional processes including physicochemical and biological methods then ultrafiltration uf and ro processes are applied to obtain a reusable water at full scale the ro process led to the generation of a highly concentrated and polluted brine stream the pilot scale brine treatment system used in this study was equipped with ozone oxidation nf ro and iex units the recovered salt solution mainly included sodium chloride and sodium sulfate the treatment performance of the pilot scale system was assessed in terms of permeate production and reusability of the produced salt solution in dyeing processes of the textile mill moreover expected environmental impacts of the brine treatment system were estimated to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first study in the literature on the recovery and reuse of textile ro brine at pilot scale 2 methods 2 1 textile mill the subject integrated textile mill is located in luleburgaz kirklareli turkey the company mainly produces polyester yarn and cotton home textiles it consumes an average of 6000 m3 day groundwater for processes household uses and other needs cleaning gardening etc an average of 5000 m3 day wastewater is treated in a wwtp installed in the company site to satisfy discharge standards by physicochemical and biological treatment following the conventional treatment approximately 60 of the treated wastewater was subjected to advanced treatment which consisted of uf and ro processes for water recovery fig 1 as part of the study the retentate brine generated by ro was treated in a pilot scale treatment system 2 2 pilot system the textile pilot system tps for brine treatment was operated for about six months fig 2 shows the scheme of the process applied for water and salt recovery from ro brine the pilot scale plant had a capacity of 2 4 m3 day the tps consisted of pre treatment concentration and softening stages the pre treatment stage was basically applied to remove impurities such as color cod sulfate and total hardness th in the ro brine influent of tps and included an ozone oxidation unit and a two stage nf unit an ro unit was installed to concentrate the pre treated brine a cationic iex column was used to obtain a softened product stream all units of the tps were operated in batch mode for each unit 24 samples were collected from the feed permeate and concentrate streams of the membrane processes and their average impurity concentrations were determined ozone oxidation was employed to oxidize at least partially organic residues and to remove color the oxidation system consisted of an ozone tank 750 l an ozone generator an activated carbon and an ultraviolet light uv unit the use of the activated carbon and uv units aimed to remove the residual ozone and to protect the membranes the ozone oxidation system was operated with a contact time of 3 h and the ozone dosage applied to the treated water was 0 4 g o3 l as the main target was to produce salt solutions mainly rich in monovalent salts which could be reused in dyeing processes initially nanofiltration 1 nf1 was employed to separate monovalent ions such as na and cl from divalent ions such as mg2 and ca2 also it was aimed to eliminate such impurities as color cod sulfate and total hardness rejection at the maximum level in this context although there are many studies in literature testing many nf membranes such as nf270 dow filmtec usa 27 29 nf90 dow filmtec usa 16 29 and trisep ts40 30 to separate divalent ions from monovalent ions in this study nfg synder filtration usa membrane was chosen based on the preliminary lab scale experiments nfg is a much less common membrane because of the moderate divalent ion rejection efficiency however it provides a higher level of monovalent ion passage into permeate table 1 based on design calculations a two stage nf configuration was run where each stage consisted of two pressure vessels with two membrane elements at each in this way nf1 was operated with an 80 water recovery rate under 10 bar operating pressure the rejected stream of the nf1 process was subjected to nanofiltration 2 nf2 to obtain additional monovalent ion passage a single stage nf configuration was run in the nf2 which consisted of one pressure vessel with two membrane elements the nf2 was operated with an 80 recovery rate under 10 20 bar operating pressure the nf1 and nf2 permeate streams which were rich in monovalent ions were subjected to ro processes in order to further develop the concentration of the nf permeates and to obtain a reusable concentrated salt solution all the tests targeted a high water recovery rate the membrane properties and operating conditions of the membrane units in tps are given in table 1 the system recovery rate was determined using the following equation 1 1 r v p v f x 100 where r v p and v f stand for the recovery rate permeate volume at the end of operation and feed volume at the beginning of the operation cycle respectively the recovery rate of the ro process was targeted to be 80 and the operating pressure ranged from 20 to 30 bars the concentrate stream of the ro unit was connected to a cationic iex column to allow the exchange of excess hardness cations ca2 and mg2 the volume of the wet resin column was approximately 150 l and filled with dowex hcr s s resin the regeneration of this resin was achieved principally with 10 nacl solution however during the tps operation since the resin did not reach exhausted regeneration was not performed removal efficiencies of the all monitored parameters were calculated using the following equation 2 2 r e i c f i c p i c f i x 100 where re i c p i and c f i stand for the removal efficiency of the parameter i the permeate concentration of the parameter i and the feed concentration of the parameter i respectively the overall input flow rate of the tps per operation cycle was set to 750l h cycle the ozone oxidation nf1 nf2 ro and iex processes were operated in feed tank volumes of 750 l 750 l 150 l 723 l and 145 l respectively 2 3 analytical methods cod th turbidity nitrogen compounds alkalinity and color were determined with standard methods 31 heavy metals were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms perkinelmer nexion 300xx icp ms ph conductivity total dissolved solids tds and salinity were determined using a hach hq40d portable multi meter sulfate chloride and phosphate were analyzed with an ion chromatography device dionex ics 1000 equipped with an as9 hc column 3 results discussions 3 1 characterization of full scale ro brine the characteristics of ro brine from industrial wastewaters might be quite different from brackish water and seawater brines main parameters such as tds cod color total hardness and so4 2 in the ro brine of the examined mill are given table 2 the results reveal that the ro brine generally contains high amounts of alkalinity hardness total nitrogen chloride sulfate and organics in addition to tds the data indicate no significant fluctuations in the ro brine many studies on the characterization of textile ro brine in the literature reveal similar results 32 however depending on textile processes the composition of ro brine may vary the average tds concentration in the ro brine was 5 9 g l during the operation textile wastewaters typically contain salt because salt is used in the dyeing process for fabric fixation 33 color values were generally found to be around 100 pt co the average cod th and alkalinity concentrations were 201 mg l 211 mg l and 2 436 mg l respectively the ro brine characterization revealed no significant oscillation in any of the parameters because the ro brine was generally a composite stream 3 2 performance of pilot scale brine treatment system performance of the pilot system was evaluated in terms of pre treatment and concentrate softening stages the pretreatment stage was assessed with the performances of the ozone and nf systems and the concentrate softening stage with the performances of the ro and iex systems the performances of the membranes were evaluated by analyzing the parameters of the permeate and concentrate streams 3 2 1 pre treatment stage ozonation process caused a significant reduction in the color and cod concentrations however it revealed no significant changes in the other parameters while the nf1 and nf2 permeates were rich in monovalent ions such as na and cl the retentate was rich in divalent ions such as ca2 and mg2 as well as color cod sulfate hardness and other salts the only waste stream of the tps was the highly concentrated nf2 retentate the pretreatment process results are given in table 3 the ozone oxidation on the effluent allowed a cod elimination of 74 and a color removal of 93 the cod and color concentrations in the effluent were on average 42 mg l and 7 pt co respectively the results were compared with the values of the literature in which ozone oxidation was applied directly on raw textile wastewater and it was found that cod and color removal rates were almost similar 34 35 at the nf1 unit the average tds rejection efficiency rate was found to be 16 letting 84 of the salts to pass to the permeate as desired moreover divalent ions and some other parameters revealed moderate rejection efficiency rates the average cod sulfate and th rejection rates were 31 50 and 39 respectively figure 3 the rejection efficiencies were also found to be in compliance with the manufacturer s data indicating a rejection rate of 50 for the mgso4 in the nfg since most of the color was removed by the ozonation process the nf1 permeate color remained below the detection limits similarly the cod rejection efficiency was found to be low in nf1 and an average of 31 mg l cod was detected in the nf1 permeate as shown in figure 3 fluctuations were observed in cod and color parameters this may be explained by the variations in production processes affecting organic material types and concentrations thus the color of wastewaters the nf1 was operated with a recovery rate of 80 with no significant scaling during the operation the nf2 revealed an average tds rejection efficiency of 39 the average rates of cod sulfate and th rejection were 52 53 and 60 respectively figure 4 due to precipitation and partial clogging of the pores the pore sizes and filtration efficiencies of the membranes decreased leading to a higher rejection of the ions the loss of pressure in the both nfs from the feed to the concentrate streams ranged from 1 to 2 bars the rejections of monovalent and divalent ions in the nfs are presented in figure 3 and figure 4 regarding the nf1 chloride rejection ranged between 10 and 24 averaging at 17 and sodium rejection oscillated between 10 and 32 averaging at 19 while a significant portion of the monovalent ions passed to the nf1 permeate ca2 and mg2 were moderately rejected by the nf while monovalent ions revealed higher oscillations in rejection with a standard deviation of 22 31 divalent ions revealed lower oscillations with a standard deviation of 8 11 these findings indicated that monovalent ions were rejected more than divalent ions under these feed water quality and operating conditions average ca2 and mg2 rejection rates were around 40 and 38 respectively the nf2 also revealed similar results as it was aimed to recover the highest amount of monovalent salts from the permeate of the nfs the adverse effects of divalent ions like ca2 and mg2 from the permeate of the nfs on the final product was mitigated by applying an iex process 3 2 2 concentration and softening stage the concentration step by ro process aimed to increase the tds concentration in the nf1 and nf2 permeates in order to reuse the salt solution in dyeing processes average tds rejection rate was found to be 97 throughout the experimental operation the ro membranes rejected 96 98 of the monovalent ions na and cl the average ca2 mg2 so4 2 and th rejection rates were found to be 94 96 99 and 94 respectively as expected fig 5 the monovalent ions of the ro feed were more concentrated by around 3 3 5 times table 4 although the desired monovalent ion concentration was reached to the targeted value the hardness concentration an undesired pollutant for dyeing processes 12 increased to 810 mg caco3 l on the other hand the ro permeate had a very good quality for reuse in any process in a textile mill the loss of pressure in the ro from the feed to the concentrate stream ranged from 1 to 2 bars therefore there was no need for chemical cleaning of the membranes during the operation dyeing processes in the textile industry require soft water the dyeing process in the examined textile mill required the salt solution to have a hardness less than 3 4 f on the other hand the limits for the quality parameters of the water to be used in dyeing processes have not been clearly specified so far 12 hardness in the pilot scale ro brine was further decreased from 810 to 41 mg caco3 l by operating a cationic iex process table 4 the detailed results of the tps operation are outlined in fig 6 the tps operation has three outputs i the ro permeate to be used for various processes in textile mill ii the iex effluent stream to be reused in dyeing processes and iii the nf2 retentate which is the only waste stream of the tps the nf2 retentate constitutes approximately 4 of the total input stream volume of the tps the recovered salt solution revealed an average hardness of 41 mg caco3 l about 4 french hardness indicating reusability in dyeing processes by mixing with softened groundwater it was observed that the examined textile mill generally used salt concentrations ranging from 10 to 60 g l in its dyeing process since the average tds concentration of the brine generated by the tps ro was 16 g l the recovered salt solution could be used in the dyeing processes however the recovered salt solution contained moderate rates of cod and color these parameters could cause problems in various dyeing processes and further studies are needed on such problems 3 2 3 environmental savings potential of the brine treatment system for textile mill significant amounts of water and salt solution were recovered from the brine of the textile mill ro unit which could be useful in dyeing processes considering the feed flow and tds concentration the recovery rates were determined with the following equation 3 in terms of the nacl of the tps 3 r s a l t q e f f l u e n t x t d s

8768,silica scaling is one of the major scaling challenges in reverse osmosis ro the safe operation practice is to keep the silica concentration below 150 mg l in ro concentrate this study addresses the effects of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium on silica scaling in a seawater ro installation used as a pretreatment to eutectic freeze crystallisation efc results showed that in the absence of antiscalant and divalent cations a sustained silica concentration of approximately 280 mg l in concentrate is possible without declining membrane permeability at a higher concentration of divalent cations the membrane permeability decreased membrane autopsy and analysing destructed membrane showed a relatively low magnesium and a high calcium concentration on the membrane after adding divalent ions into the solutions it is concluded that in absence of divalent cations and without antiscalant the limits of 150 mg l silica can be extended to 280 mg l for 6 8 h keywords membrane

l tds total dissolved solids bwro for waters with salinities between 1000 and 12000 mg l tds and swro for waters with salinity higher than 12 000 mg l tds this makes sanitary ro suitable for treatment of fresh water or tap water bwro for treatment of brackish groundwater and swro for treatment of seawater concentrate of bwro or concentrate of swro 1 2 for instance application of bwro in green houses widely occurs in many countries where horticulture is an economic pillar such as the netherlands in the western part of the netherlands about 30 of required water for horticulture is provided by bwro using brackish ground water it is predicated that in the coming years the usage of bwro will increase due to significant and rapid climate change and population increase this increases the necessity of finding techno economic solutions to i reduce the membrane scaling which is the main fouling mechanism in bwro and ii to prevent environmental damages that can occur as a consequence of discharging concentrate into the ground by inland installations 3 concentrate disposal is the most significant environmental consideration for inland bwro facilities common methods for handling ro concentrate include discharge to surface water discharge to the sewage system using an evaporation pond evaporation eutectic freeze crystallisation efc and deep well injection 4 choosing the proper method to deal with concentrate depends on the concentrate quality site location characteristics system recovery available facilities at the location and local regulations evaporation ponds provide an economic solution for concentrate treatment in hot arid areas with inexpensive land available in this method concentrate is pumped into large ponds and water slowly evaporates via direct solar energy the simplicity of this process reduces maintenance and operating costs and reduces energy input 5 in addition the produced salt can be used in industry the evaporation ponds are normally constructed in the remote area to reduce the effects of possible pollution transferred by the wind deep well injection is frequently used to dispose the concentrate by inland sites in this method concentrate is injected down a deep well into a confined aquifer which is not connected to any adjacent fresh or brackish water aquifers 4 6 however the environmental regulations are becoming stricter using deep well injection as a result of the unknown effects of concentrate on the target aquifer one of the measures to reduce these unknown effects is to avoid dosing of antiscalant however this limits the recovery of bwro to 50 or less and increases the energy consumption for producing the same amount of water evaporation and or efc is recommended for concentrate treatment when treatment methods such as evaporation ponds and deep well injection are not feasible these techniques consume vast amounts of energy and in order to be economically efficient need pretreatment processes to minimise the volume and maximise the salt concentration of their feed to prepare the bwro concentrate as feed for these techniques the installation has to work at the highest possible recovery and or alternatively thicken the concentrate before these techniques using swro furthermore when swro is applied the highest possible recovery is desirable in order to reduce the concentrate treatment costs to increase the efficiency of these techniques and obtain products salts of a high purity no antiscalant should be added into the water during the ro process es as the recovery rate increases the magnitude of concentration polarisation increases and membrane scaling can occur undesirable consequences of scaling include a decline in membrane flux water production deterioration in product water quality by increased salt passage or increased operating pressure to maintain flux with a subsequent increase in energy costs scaling is the primary fouling mechanism in bwro operating at high recovery and treatment of its concentrate biofouling and particulate fouling are less important in bwro because of the anaerobic conditions of groundwater in most cases natural and artificial screens before the ro and the fact that groundwater is directly fed to the bwro installations in aerobic conditions the absence of microorganisms and particles in the feed water of bwro results in the absence of these substances in the concentrate thus reducing the concentrate volume depends on the concentration of dissolved ions types of ions present in concentrate type of membrane and operational conditions the current research provides experimental data on the silica scaling in swro when used for reducing the concentrate volume of bwro and preparing it as the feed to the efc evaporator for optimal efficiency that is interesting because typically silica is not considered a compound of high scaling in swro because i seawater contains silica of less than 20 mg l with an average of 4 5 mg l 1 5 ii typical recovery of swro installation is rather low about 30 50 2 background silica can be found in many different forms and it is influenced by a variety of factors including temperature ph metal ions such as strontium potassium sodium aluminium and iron and ionic strength 7 8 the soluble form of silica is initially monomeric as it contains only one silicon atom 9 and is called monosilicic acid the silica dissolution involves a chemical reaction or hydrolysis in an excess of water 10 1 s i o 2 2 h 2 o s i o h 4 many studies are performed on the silica solubility in water at temperatures between 0 and 100 c a solubility of 70 mg l is reported for anhydrous nonporous amorphous silica at 25 c and a solubility of 100 140 mg l for the common forms of silica 10 kempter et al 8 reported a solubility of 6 mg l for crystalline silica and 180 mg l for amorphous silica monosilicic acid which is a weak acid remains in the monomeric state for long periods in water at 25 c as long as the concentration is below 2 mm around 300 mg l but usually polymerises rapidly at higher concentrations due to the condensation reaction 10 12 it polymerises by dehydration to form si o si anhydride bonds dimer from and as a result respectively dimers two subunits linked and oligomers a finite number of subunits linked are formed 13 finally colloidal polymers and particulate silica will be formed the dimerisation reaction is shown below 2 s i o h 4 o h s i o o h 3 h 2 o 3 s i o o h 3 s i o h 4 o h 3 s i o s i o h 3 o h d i m e r i z a t i o n in the literature it is shown that each type of membrane reacts differently with silica ro is typically suitable for removing dissolved silica and ultrafiltration for colloidal silica depending on whether the polymerisation of silica occurs on the interface surface of the membrane or in the bulk solution the silica fouling can be classified into respectively precipitation fouling or scaling and particulate fouling scaling occurs when monomeric silica polymerises at the membrane surface and therefore scaling is enhanced by a high rejection of dissolved silica by the ro membrane particulate fouling of silica occurs as a result of silica colloids accumulating after they are formed in the bulk solution and at the membrane surface therefore ultrafiltration is typically used to remove non reactive silica because removing silica scaling from ro membrane surface is not possible with current cleaning mechanisms and without damaging the membrane it is preferred to prevent silica scaling the conventional method to control silica scaling system is by operating the ro system at low recovery and limiting the silica concentration to less than 150 mg l as sio2 14 the industrial guideline suggests a maximum concentration of 120 mg l as sio2 in the concentrate flow at 25 c 14 by dosing of a dedicated antiscalant against silica scaling the system can operate with a silica concentration up to 300 mg l sio2 8 15 16 however dosing antiscalant reduces the purity of salts produced by efc evaporators when these techniques are applied to treat the ro concentrate with an ensuing decrease in the salts value moreover the pressure retarded osmosis process is more susceptible for silica scaling wang et al 16 reported that silica scaling during the pressure retarded osmosis process can occur at a concentration as low as 10 mg l they found that the precipitation and deposition of silica mainly occurred at the interface between the rejection layer and the support layer they showed that low ph using an acidic draw solution can be an effective method for silica scaling control the scaling mechanism of silica remains difficult to understand kempter et al 17 investigated the adsorption and the formation of silica scale on ro membrane surfaces by means of time resolved atomic force microscopy results show that the first step of silica precipitation without additives is the formation of colloidal particles in the range of 20 30 nm in the bulk solution which deposit onto the membrane surface over time the surface is densely covered with sio2 particles tong et al 18 investigated the relationship between membrane surface properties and silica scaling in ro they showed that the rate of silica scaling was independent of both the membrane hydrophilicity and the free energy for heterogeneous nucleation but depended on the membrane surface charge their results show that positively charged membranes significantly facilitated silica scaling whereas a more negative membrane surface charge leads to reduced scaling tong et al 18 suggested that deposition of positive species on the membrane can enhance silica scaling this finding is confirmed by sheikholeslami et al 9 they state that the formation kinetics of polymeric silica from monosilic acid is catalysed by hydroxide ions accelerated by the presence of salts such as cacl2 and mgcl2 and influenced by the ph calcium can stimulate the formation of filterable silica size 0 45 μm in low concentration silica solution and magnesium can stimulate the formation of filterable silica polymers in high silica concentration 19 20 presence of other ions such as aluminium in feed water of ro can also enhance the silica scaling the use of aluminium sulphate alum coagulation prior to reverse osmosis ro was investigated by gabelich et al 21 they showed that the coagulation process with alum causes membrane fouling this resulted from the reaction of soluble aluminium with ambient silica h4sio2 and forming kaolinite within the ro unit lunevich et al 22 explain that the presence of aluminium on silicate species has three effects i aluminium ions connected to silicate ii aluminium ions forced rearrangement of species into smaller groups and iii it is likely that some silicate species precipitated as aluminium silicate their study also suggests that sodium ions prevent silica deposition on the membrane surface while the presence of aluminium is of high importance for the formation of silica scaling it is not considered in this study since the original water used in this experiment was groundwater in which no aluminium was detected most naturally occurring aluminium compounds have very low solubility between ph 6 and 9 therefore dissolved forms rarely occur in natural waters in concentrations exceeding 0 01 mg l 23 compared to aluminium there is a higher chance that calcium and magnesium occurring in groundwater together with silica typically hardness scaling mainly calcium and magnesium is considered reversible whereas silica and silicate scaling as irreversible silica scaling in the light form can be removed from the membrane by using ammonium bifluoride but redissolving silica in the severe form will damage the membrane 15 24 when both the hardness ions and silica are present in water silica scaling can be enhanced koo et al 12 found that an increase in calcium and magnesium concentration resulted in the increase of the polymerisation rate of silica sheikholeslami 9 et al reported that the ca mg ratio did not affect the solubility limit of the silica but influences the rate of polymerisation separate measures should be taken to prevent or reduce the scale formation of salts formed due to the hardness ions or silica kempter et al 17 showed that within 24 h experiment virtually no polymerisation occurs up to 400 mg l initial silica in hard water 28 german hardness temperature of 40 c ph 7 and without any additives above the supersaturation level of 400 mg l an immediate precipitation occurs in ro systems operating at ph above 9 hydroxide of cations such as calcium magnesium strontium potassium and sodium are capable of undergoing reaction with silica 14 25 among the resulting products magnesium silicate scaling mgsio3 is more likely to scale the membrane which is dense and strenuous to be removed 26 although commonly referred to as mgsio3 magnesium silicate is hypothesised to be present in water treatment systems as a result of a multistep process resulting in a mixture of a variety of chemical species containing magnesium and silica 14 the first step is the formation of magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 the hydroxide salt reacts with monomeric silicate anion and or polymeric silica to form magnesium silicate 26 the formation of silica scaling species can be mitigated by removing silica ions or the hardness ions from the feed water of ro silica removal techniques include dosing lime or dosing coagulants such as aluminium or iron electrocoagulation adsorption ion exchange and seeded precipitation 27 however the most common pretreatment method in water and wastewater treatment is to apply ion exchange softeners to remove hardness ions and ph increase to alleviate silica scaling additionally it is possible to reduce the ph and consequently risks of calcium and magnesium scaling the literature only reveals limited information regarding the effects of calcium and magnesium on silica scaling in ro without using antiscalant particularly in combination with ion exchange softeners the current study aims to investigate the scaling potentials of the ro installation at a high silica concentration without using antiscalant and in the absence of divalent hardness cations to this aim the concentrate from a bwro installation which was directly applied on groundwater is collected passed through an ion exchange column and fed to a swro in addition the effects of increasing the concentration of calcium and magnesium on the formation of silica complexes are investigated this is performed by stepwise increase of the concentration factor of the feed water of the swro this study contributes to an efficient treatment of industrial brine containing silica magnesium and calcium as well as understanding the role of hardness ions in initiation of silica scaling in swro 3 material and methods fig 1 shows a schematic view of the experimental setup the concentrate of an existing bwro system 1 was passed through a cation ion exchange column iex filled with amberlite irc747 dupont resins to remove multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 and fe3 the effluent of iex was collected in a tank after which it was fed to swro swc2540 from hydranautics as a means to decrease its volume and prepare it to be used by the efc unit the concentrate was collected on the same day in six ibc tanks of each 1000l from a brackish groundwater ro system operating at recovery of around 50 without adding any antiscalant an iex column filled with amberlite irc747 was used to remove the hardness ions from the concentrate amberlite irc747 resin has a macroporous structure its polystyrenic matrix cross linked with divinylbenzene contains amino phosphonic groups the chemical nature of these groups is such that they form complexes with metal ions according to the manufacturer this resin features high operating capacity for calcium and is especially useful when treating brine the softened effluent of iex 2 entered a 3 m3 container and was used as the feed water for the ro in the setup swc2540 from hydranautics was used to thicken the effluent of iex swc2540 is an swro membrane and made of composite polyamide membrane with a minimum slat rejection of 99 at ph 7 the membrane zeta potential is 21 2 mv 28 the initiation of scaling was predicted by measuring the mass transfer coefficient mtc at a constant flux 15 l h m2 and a constant element recovery 8 three experiments were performed during which the parameters for determining the membrane s mtc were measured at a specific feed concentration and in several steps for a period of about 8 h to maintain constant feed composition during this 8 h trajectory permeate and concentrate streams of ro were recirculated back into the feed tank while the temperature was kept constant using a cooling spiral after the constant feed composition process permeate was discharged and the feed solution was allowed to build up a higher concentration next the experiment was continued with a new concentration fig 2 the solution diffusion model one of the theories that describe the transport of mass through the ro membranes describes the performance of a perfect non defected membrane at given conditions the membrane mtc remains constant until fouling occurs i e mtc indicates the membrane permeability for water mtc is based on the membrane characteristics such as the thickness and porosity and can be estimated by using equation 4 16 29 jw is the water flux qp is the permeate flow amem

experiment the system was operated with demineralised water for about 24 h to recover the initial mtc membrane cleaning and operating of membrane at constant conditions feed concentration temperature and flux ensure that mtc changes only with the membrane fouling i e in the given conditions mtc can be used as an indicator of membrane fouling table 1 represents the effluent of cationic iex i e the initial feed concentration in each experiment the initial conditions table 1 are not exactly the same in all experiments because the iex capacity decreases in time consequently the value of ca2 and mg2 concentration is lowest in experiment 01 and highest in experiment 03 it can be seen that during the concentration mode the concentration of all ions including calcium and magnesium increases additionally we inspect the membrane visually destructed the membrane and analysed the results and used a model to investigate the reason of mtc decrease whether it is because of membrane fouling and to determine the nature of fouling the visual inspection is performed with the electronic microscope since the visual inspection does not reveal any information about the nature of fouling two equal sized membrane pieces from different locations are cut and destructed thereafter their elemental ions are determined and compared information from the destruction method gives only local information about the detected ions found but not about the type of scaling therefore a geochemical model phreeqc is used to calculate the saturation indexes the saturation indexes are used to make a prediction about the type of scaling on the membrane surface more detailed explanation about the methods used in this study can be found in the results and discussion section 4 results and discussion 4 1 permeate water no divalent ions or silica were detected in the ro permeate the salinity of permeate increased at the higher thickening factors the highest measured ec in permeate was 1380 μs cm that is mainly caused by the presence of sodium chlorite and species of inorganic carbon 4 2 mtc mtc can be used as an indication tool for determining the initiation of membrane fouling to determine the initiation of membrane fouling we performed experiments with swro and used the obtained results to calculate the mtc the calculated mtc s are presented in fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 the initial water composition for each experiment is mentioned in table 1 mtc starts at different values in each figure figs 3 fig 4 and fig 5 because of the different thickening factor of feed solution in the recirculation mode as explained mtc is calculated using the measured ec of solution which is caused by an inaccurate calculation of the osmotic pressure however during each recirculation mode the salt concentration remains constant and therefore the osmotic pressure in each recirculation mode remains the same this means that if no fouling occurs the mtc in each recirculation mode should not change i e a straight horizontal mtc line indicates no fouling and or scaling figs 3 and 4 show that the mtc decline was not significant up to thickening factor five cf 3 5 indicating that no detectable fouling or scaling occurred in experiment 1 and experiment 2 these graphs show a slight decrease of mtc at higher thickening factor contrary to experiment 1 and 2 fig 5 shows a rapid decrease of mtc at cf 3 5 in experiment 3 fig 6 compares the mtc of three membranes the graph shows that the mtc decreases due to the increase in concentration of calcium and magnesium while not significant there is an mtc decrease in experiment 02 compared to experiment 01 the mtc decrease becomes remarkable in experiment 03 when the concentration of calcium and magnesium are respectively 50 and 74 mg l in the initial state the decrease of mtc indicates the initiation of membrane fouling by a continued membrane process scaling of membrane occurs discontinued processes such as closed circuit reverse osmosis ccro 31 32 can offer a solution to postpone the scaling this type of process can further reduce the concentrate volume further until it meets the criteria needed in order for it to be treated by the final processes such as efc and evaporation at the given conditions the mtc decrease is typically the result of membrane fouling to have visual evidence if the membrane is fouled autopsy was performed on each membrane first the unravelled membrane is scanned with the naked eye then the suspected parts to fouling are identified and finally are inspected under an electron microscope fig 7 shows a very small part of the membrane l 65 μm x b 50 μm under the electron microscope the figure shows that the diameter of the largest observed fouling spot was about 15 μm the nature of the fouling scaling could not be determined neither by the mtc figures figs 3 fig 4 and fig 5 nor by the observation of fouling under the microscope fig 7 therefore two pieces of membrane b 10 cm by h 10 cm from the element in experiment 03 were destructed by hydrofluoric hf in the laboratory and under standard protocols astm d6357 table 2 shows the concentration of elements achieved form destructing the membrane coupon coupon 01 was obtained from a part of membrane that seemed to be fouled and coupon 02 from a part which seemed glassy compared to other parts of the membrane the results from table 2 show that respectively sulphur silicon and calcium have the highest concentration the high sulphur s concentration is originated from the membrane material itself because the support layer of most polyamide membrane is made of polysulphide expectedly the concentration of silica in coupon 02 with a glassy part inside is higher than coupon 01 this is an indication of the local silica scaling on the membrane the higher calcium concentration in coupon 01 could be an indication of local calcium precipitation in another attempt to determine the type of fouling phreeqc is used to detect which substances could cause the mtc declination phreeqc is a computer program designed to perform a wide variety of aqueous geochemical calculations and processes in natural waters or laboratory experiments 33 it has different database models one of which has to be used based on the input data and purpose of the modelling one of these databases called phreeqc which uses ion association and debye hückel expressions to account for the non ideality of the aqueous solutions this type of aqueous model is adequate at low ionic strength but may break down at higher ionic strengths in the range of seawater and above in sodium chloride dominated systems such as this study the phreeqc database is reliable at higher ionic strengths 34 table 3 shows the input values for the phreeqc simulation which is a dataset of four samples from the ro concentrate in experiment 03 at concentration factors 1 2 51 3 06 3 28 and 3 49 the temperature and ph used for simulation are measured during the experiments while the ion concentration is analysed with ion chromatography ic after the experiments most of the ions are more concentrated after a concentration step but the increase is lower than expected from the concentration factor the reason for these lower values is twofold ions are not rejected 100 by the membrane and pass to the permeate side of the membrane this is mainly the case at higher concentrations and for monovalent ions the other reason is that ions are transformed into the solid precipitate the phreeqc output includes different parameters among which saturation index si that determines which scaling can be formed on the membrane fig 8 illustrates the si variations by increasing the concentration factor for the ease of visibility salts with low saturation index are removed from fig 8 based on the results from fig 8 three important groups of species could be distinguished 1 species that have only silica molecules in their chemical formulations such as chalcedony quartz and silicic acid sio2 a the si value of this group increases by increasing the cf up to cf 3 28 and then decreases by further increase 2 species with magnesium and silica in their chemical formulation such as sepiolite and talc the si values of this group show a fast increase with the increase of the cf in the last concentration step the si does not further increase indicating the start of scaling this is confirmed by the results found by amjad et al 26 they found that among hydroxides of cations the magnesium silicate scaling mgsio3 is more likely to scale the membrane and more strenuous to be removed when precipitated because of their dense structure it is observed that talc has a very high supersaturation but the si increases with each concentration step only the last concentration step shows a constant si indicating that the ions for this salt are no longer accumulating and scaling occurs this agrees with the mtc decrease at the highest concentration of experiment 03 furthermore the si of seplolite does not further increase at the last concentration step so also this silica component will be scaling in this experiment 3 it appears that no calcium silica precipitates were formed during the experiment however dolomite which is composed of the calcium magnesium and carbonate is a possible scaling component 5 conclusions the main aim of this study was to determine the effects of calcium and magnesium in silica scaling of reverse osmosis ro the effects of other ions such as aluminium and iron are not considered in this study this is mainly because the original groundwater did not contain aluminium the concentration of iron approximated 3 mg l in this water which was reduced to 0 1 mg l after the iex and virtually zero before the swro in fact in the absence of any antiscalant no membrane mass transfer mtc decrease was observed up to a silica concentration of 280 mg sio2 l at low concentration of calcium and magnesium indicating no membrane fouling this is of course only valid for the timeframe where each experiment is conducted about 8 h increasing the calcium and magnesium concentration resulted in the decline of mass transfer coefficient mtc by the membrane analysing different membrane coupons from the experiment with a sudden decrease in mtc showed a high concentration of silica on some parts of the membrane and calcium on the other parts simulation with phreeqc software and results from membrane destruction pointed out that the formation potential of magnesium silica species is higher than calcium silica species at the given conditions and confirmed the findings of previous studies however the related mechanisms should be more widely investigated the current study reveals that silica scaling can be enhanced by magnesium ions probably by talc and or sepiolite formation under conditions similar to those in this study it is probably helpful to use the closed circuit reverse osmosis ccro techniques instead of continued conventional ro to reduce the concentrate volume without enhancing silica scaling using of ccro is the topic of our next study related to silica our forthcoming follow up study related to silica addresses the use of the closed circuit reverse osmosis ccro techniques instead of continued conventional ro to reduce the concentrate volume without enhancing silica scaling we also advise

8768,silica scaling is one of the major scaling challenges in reverse osmosis ro the safe operation practice is to keep the silica concentration below 150 mg l in ro concentrate this study addresses the effects of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium on silica scaling in a seawater ro installation used as a pretreatment to eutectic freeze crystallisation efc results showed that in the absence of antiscalant and divalent cations a sustained silica concentration of approximately 280 mg l in concentrate is possible without declining membrane permeability at a higher concentration of divalent cations the membrane permeability decreased membrane autopsy and analysing destructed membrane showed a relatively low magnesium and a high calcium concentration on the membrane after adding divalent ions into the solutions it is concluded that in absence of divalent cations and without antiscalant the limits of 150 mg l silica can be extended to 280 mg l for 6 8 h keywords membrane

typical recovery of swro installation is rather low about 30 50 2 background silica can be found in many different forms and it is influenced by a variety of factors including temperature ph metal ions such as strontium potassium sodium aluminium and iron and ionic strength 7 8 the soluble form of silica is initially monomeric as it contains only one silicon atom 9 and is called monosilicic

solubility of 6 mg l for crystalline silica and 180 mg l for amorphous silica monosilicic acid which is a weak acid remains in the monomeric state for long periods in water at 25 c as long as the concentration is below 2 mm around 300 mg l but usually polymerises rapidly at higher concentrations due to the condensation reaction 10 12 it polymerises by dehydration to form si o si anhydride

silica polymerises at the membrane surface and therefore scaling is enhanced by a high rejection of dissolved silica by the ro membrane particulate fouling of silica occurs as a result of silica colloids accumulating after they are formed in the bulk solution and at the membrane surface therefore ultrafiltration is typically used to remove non reactive silica because removing silica scaling from ro membrane surface is not possible with current cleaning mechanisms and without damaging the membrane it is preferred to prevent silica scaling the conventional method to control silica scaling system is by operating the ro system at low recovery and limiting the silica concentration to less than 150 mg l as sio2 14 the industrial guideline suggests a maximum concentration of 120 mg l as sio2 in the concentrate flow at 25 c 14 by dosing of a dedicated antiscalant against silica scaling the system can operate with a silica concentration up to 300 mg l sio2 8 15 16 however dosing antiscalant reduces the purity of salts produced by efc evaporators when these techniques are applied to treat the ro concentrate with an ensuing decrease in the salts value moreover the pressure retarded osmosis process is more susceptible for silica scaling wang et al 16 reported that silica scaling during the pressure retarded osmosis process can occur at a concentration as low as 10 mg l they found that the precipitation and deposition of silica mainly occurred at the interface between the rejection layer and the support layer they showed that low ph using an acidic draw solution can be an effective method for silica scaling control the scaling mechanism of silica remains difficult to understand kempter et al 17 investigated the adsorption and the formation of silica scale on ro membrane surfaces by means of time resolved atomic force microscopy results show that the first step of silica precipitation without additives is the formation of colloidal particles in the range of 20 30 nm in the bulk solution which deposit onto the membrane surface over time the surface is densely covered with sio2 particles tong et al 18 investigated the relationship between membrane surface properties and silica scaling in ro they showed that the rate of silica scaling was independent of both the membrane hydrophilicity and the free energy for heterogeneous nucleation but depended on the membrane surface charge their results show that positively charged membranes significantly facilitated silica scaling whereas a more negative membrane surface charge leads to reduced scaling tong et al 18 suggested that deposition of positive species on the membrane can enhance silica scaling this finding is confirmed by sheikholeslami et al 9 they state that the formation kinetics of polymeric silica from monosilic acid is catalysed by hydroxide ions accelerated by the presence of salts such as cacl2 and mgcl2 and influenced by the ph calcium can stimulate the formation of filterable silica size 0 45 μm in low concentration silica solution and magnesium can stimulate the formation of filterable silica polymers in high silica concentration 19 20 presence of other ions such as aluminium in feed water of ro can also enhance the silica scaling the use of aluminium sulphate alum coagulation prior to reverse osmosis ro was investigated by gabelich et al 21 they showed that the coagulation process with alum causes membrane fouling this resulted from the reaction of soluble aluminium with ambient silica h4sio2 and forming kaolinite within the ro unit lunevich et al 22 explain that the presence of aluminium on silicate species has three effects i aluminium ions connected to silicate ii aluminium ions forced rearrangement of species into smaller groups and iii it is likely that some silicate species precipitated as aluminium silicate their study also suggests that sodium ions prevent silica deposition on the membrane surface while the presence of aluminium is of high importance for the formation of silica scaling it is not considered in this study since the original water used in this experiment was groundwater in which no aluminium was detected most naturally occurring aluminium compounds have very low solubility between ph 6 and 9 therefore dissolved forms rarely occur in natural waters in concentrations exceeding 0 01 mg l 23 compared to aluminium there is a higher chance that calcium and magnesium occurring in groundwater together with silica typically hardness scaling mainly calcium and magnesium is considered reversible whereas silica and silicate scaling as irreversible silica scaling in the light form can be removed from the membrane by using ammonium bifluoride but redissolving silica in the severe form will damage the membrane 15 24 when both the hardness ions and silica are present in water silica scaling can be enhanced koo et al 12 found that an increase in calcium and magnesium concentration resulted in the increase of the polymerisation rate of silica sheikholeslami 9 et al reported that the ca mg ratio did not affect the solubility limit of the silica but influences the rate of polymerisation separate measures should be taken to prevent or reduce the scale formation of salts formed due to the hardness ions or silica kempter et al 17 showed that within 24 h experiment virtually no polymerisation occurs up to 400 mg l initial silica in hard water 28 german hardness temperature of 40 c ph 7 and without any additives above the supersaturation level of 400 mg l an immediate precipitation occurs in ro systems operating at ph above 9 hydroxide of cations such as calcium magnesium strontium potassium and sodium are capable of undergoing reaction with silica 14 25 among the resulting products magnesium silicate scaling mgsio3 is more likely to scale the membrane which is dense and strenuous to be removed 26 although commonly referred to as mgsio3 magnesium silicate is hypothesised to be present in water treatment systems as a result of a multistep process resulting in a mixture of a variety of chemical species containing magnesium and silica 14 the first step is the formation of magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 the hydroxide salt reacts with monomeric silicate anion and or polymeric silica to form magnesium silicate 26 the formation of silica scaling species can be mitigated by removing silica ions or the hardness ions from the feed water of ro silica removal techniques include dosing lime or dosing coagulants such as aluminium or iron electrocoagulation adsorption ion exchange and seeded precipitation 27 however the most common pretreatment method in water and wastewater treatment is to apply ion exchange softeners to remove hardness ions and ph increase to alleviate silica scaling additionally it is possible to reduce the ph and consequently risks of calcium and magnesium scaling the literature only reveals limited information regarding the effects of calcium and magnesium on silica scaling in ro without using antiscalant particularly in combination with ion exchange softeners the current study aims to investigate the scaling potentials of the ro installation at a high silica concentration without using antiscalant and in the absence of divalent hardness cations to this aim the concentrate from a bwro installation which was directly applied on groundwater is collected passed through an ion exchange column and fed to a swro in addition the effects of increasing the concentration of calcium and magnesium on the formation of silica complexes are investigated this is performed by stepwise increase of the concentration factor of the feed water of the swro this study contributes to an efficient treatment of industrial brine containing silica magnesium and calcium as well as understanding the role of hardness ions in initiation of silica scaling in swro 3 material and methods fig 1 shows a schematic view of the experimental setup the concentrate of an existing bwro system 1 was passed through a cation ion exchange column iex filled with amberlite irc747 dupont resins to remove multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 and fe3 the effluent of iex was collected in a tank after which it was fed to swro swc2540 from hydranautics as a means to decrease its volume and prepare it to be used by the efc unit the concentrate was collected on the same day in six ibc tanks of each 1000l from a brackish groundwater ro system operating at recovery of around 50 without adding any antiscalant an iex column filled with amberlite irc747 was used to remove the hardness ions from the concentrate amberlite irc747 resin has a macroporous structure its polystyrenic matrix cross linked with divinylbenzene contains amino phosphonic groups the chemical nature of these groups is such that they form complexes with metal ions according to the manufacturer this resin features high operating capacity for calcium and is especially useful when treating brine the softened effluent of iex 2 entered a 3 m3 container and was used as the feed water for the ro in the setup swc2540 from hydranautics was used to thicken the effluent of iex swc2540 is an swro membrane and made of composite polyamide membrane with a minimum slat rejection of 99 at ph 7 the membrane zeta potential is 21 2 mv 28 the initiation of scaling was predicted by measuring the mass transfer coefficient mtc at a constant flux 15 l h m2 and a constant element recovery 8 three experiments were performed during which the parameters for determining the membrane s mtc were measured at a specific feed concentration and in several steps for a period of about 8 h to maintain constant feed composition during this 8 h trajectory permeate and concentrate streams of ro were recirculated back into the feed tank while the temperature was kept constant using a cooling spiral after the constant feed composition process permeate was discharged and the feed solution was allowed to build up a higher concentration next the experiment was continued with a new concentration fig 2 the solution diffusion model one of the theories that describe the transport of mass through the ro membranes describes the performance of a perfect non defected membrane at given conditions the membrane mtc remains constant until fouling occurs i e mtc indicates the membrane permeability for water mtc is based on the membrane characteristics such as the thickness and porosity and can be estimated by using equation 4 16 29 jw is the water flux qp is the permeate flow amem

experiment the system was operated with demineralised water for about 24 h to recover the initial mtc membrane cleaning and operating of membrane at constant conditions feed concentration temperature and flux ensure that mtc changes only with the membrane fouling i e in the given conditions mtc can be used as an indicator of membrane fouling table 1 represents the effluent of cationic iex i e the initial feed concentration in each experiment the initial conditions table 1 are not exactly the same in all experiments because the iex capacity decreases in time consequently the value of ca2 and mg2 concentration is lowest in experiment 01 and highest in experiment 03 it can be seen that during the concentration mode the concentration of all ions including calcium and magnesium increases additionally we inspect the membrane visually destructed the membrane and analysed the results and used a model to investigate the reason of mtc decrease whether it is because of membrane fouling and to determine the nature of fouling the visual inspection is performed with the electronic microscope since the visual inspection does not reveal any information about the nature of fouling two equal sized membrane pieces from different locations are cut and destructed thereafter their elemental ions are determined and compared information from the destruction method gives only local information about the detected ions found but not about the type of scaling therefore a geochemical model phreeqc is used to calculate the saturation indexes the saturation indexes are used to make a prediction about the type of scaling on the membrane surface more detailed explanation about the methods used in this study can be found in the results and discussion section 4 results and discussion 4 1 permeate water no divalent ions or silica were detected in the ro permeate the salinity of permeate increased at the higher thickening factors the highest measured ec in permeate was 1380 μs cm that is mainly caused by the presence of sodium chlorite and species of inorganic carbon 4 2 mtc mtc can be used as an indication tool for determining the initiation of membrane fouling to determine the initiation of membrane fouling we performed experiments with swro and used the obtained results to calculate the mtc the calculated mtc s are presented in fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 the initial water composition for each experiment is mentioned in table 1 mtc starts at different values in each figure figs 3 fig 4 and fig 5 because of the different thickening factor of feed solution in the recirculation mode as explained mtc is calculated using the measured ec of solution which is caused by an inaccurate calculation of the osmotic pressure however during each recirculation mode the salt concentration remains constant and therefore the osmotic pressure in each recirculation mode remains the same this means that if no fouling occurs the mtc in each recirculation mode should not change i e a straight horizontal mtc line indicates no fouling and or scaling figs 3 and 4 show that the mtc decline was not significant up to thickening factor five cf 3 5 indicating that no detectable fouling or scaling occurred in experiment 1 and experiment 2 these graphs show a slight decrease of mtc at higher thickening factor contrary to experiment 1 and 2 fig 5 shows a rapid decrease of mtc at cf 3 5 in experiment 3 fig 6 compares the mtc of three membranes the graph shows that the mtc decreases due to the increase in concentration of calcium and magnesium while not significant there is an mtc decrease in experiment 02 compared to experiment 01 the mtc decrease becomes remarkable in experiment 03 when the concentration of calcium and magnesium are respectively 50 and 74 mg l in the initial state the decrease of mtc indicates the initiation of membrane fouling by a continued membrane process scaling of membrane occurs discontinued processes such as closed circuit reverse osmosis ccro 31 32 can offer a solution to postpone the scaling this type of process can further reduce the concentrate volume further until it meets the criteria needed in order for it to be treated by the final processes such as efc and evaporation at the given conditions the mtc decrease is typically the result of membrane fouling to have visual evidence if the membrane is fouled autopsy was performed on each membrane first the unravelled membrane is scanned with the naked eye then the suspected parts to fouling are identified and finally are inspected under an electron microscope fig 7 shows a very small part of the membrane l 65 μm x b 50 μm under the electron microscope the figure shows that the diameter of the largest observed fouling spot was about 15 μm the nature of the fouling scaling could not be determined neither by the mtc figures figs 3 fig 4 and fig 5 nor by the observation of fouling under the microscope fig 7 therefore two pieces of membrane b 10 cm by h 10 cm from the element in experiment 03 were destructed by hydrofluoric hf in the laboratory and under standard protocols astm d6357 table 2 shows the concentration of elements achieved form destructing the membrane coupon coupon 01 was obtained from a part of membrane that seemed to be fouled and coupon 02 from a part which seemed glassy compared to other parts of the membrane the results from table 2 show that respectively sulphur silicon and calcium have the highest concentration the high sulphur s concentration is originated from the membrane material itself because the support layer of most polyamide membrane is made of polysulphide expectedly the concentration of silica in coupon 02 with a glassy part inside is higher than coupon 01 this is an indication of the local silica scaling on the membrane the higher calcium concentration in coupon 01 could be an indication of local calcium precipitation in another attempt to determine the type of fouling phreeqc is used to detect which substances could cause the mtc declination phreeqc is a computer program designed to perform a wide variety of aqueous geochemical calculations and processes in natural waters or laboratory experiments 33 it has different database models one of which has to be used based on the input data and purpose of the modelling one of these databases called phreeqc which uses ion association and debye hückel expressions to account for the non ideality of the aqueous solutions this type of aqueous model is adequate at low ionic strength but may break down at higher ionic strengths in the range of seawater and above in sodium chloride dominated systems such as this study the phreeqc database is reliable at higher ionic strengths 34 table 3 shows the input values for the phreeqc simulation which is a dataset of four samples from the ro concentrate in experiment 03 at concentration factors 1 2 51 3 06 3 28 and 3 49 the temperature and ph used for simulation are measured during the experiments while the ion concentration is analysed with ion chromatography ic after the experiments most of the ions are more concentrated after a concentration step but the increase is lower than expected from the concentration factor the reason for these lower values is twofold ions are not rejected 100 by the membrane and pass to the permeate side of the membrane this is mainly the case at higher concentrations and for monovalent ions the other reason is that ions are transformed into the solid precipitate the phreeqc output includes different parameters among which saturation index si that determines which scaling can be formed on the membrane fig 8 illustrates the si variations by increasing the concentration factor for the ease of visibility salts with low saturation index are removed from fig 8 based on the results from fig 8 three important groups of species could be distinguished 1 species that have only silica molecules in their chemical formulations such as chalcedony quartz and silicic acid sio2 a the si value of this group increases by increasing the cf up to cf 3 28 and then decreases by further increase 2 species with magnesium and silica in their chemical formulation such as sepiolite and talc the si values of this group show a fast increase with the increase of the cf in the last concentration step the si does not further increase indicating the start of scaling this is confirmed by the results found by amjad et al 26 they found that among hydroxides of cations the magnesium silicate scaling mgsio3 is more likely to scale the membrane and more strenuous to be removed when precipitated because of their dense structure it is observed that talc has a very high supersaturation but the si increases with each concentration step only the last concentration step shows a constant si indicating that the ions for this salt are no longer accumulating and scaling occurs this agrees with the mtc decrease at the highest concentration of experiment 03 furthermore the si of seplolite does not further increase at the last concentration step so also this silica component will be scaling in this experiment 3 it appears that no calcium silica precipitates were formed during the experiment however dolomite which is composed of the calcium magnesium and carbonate is a possible scaling component 5 conclusions the main aim of this study was to determine the effects of calcium and magnesium in silica scaling of reverse osmosis ro the effects of other ions such as aluminium and iron are not considered in this study this is mainly because the original groundwater did not contain aluminium the concentration of iron approximated 3 mg l in this water which was reduced to 0 1 mg l after the iex and virtually zero before the swro in fact in the absence of any antiscalant no membrane mass transfer mtc decrease was observed up to a silica concentration of 280 mg sio2 l at low concentration of calcium and magnesium indicating no membrane fouling this is of course only valid for the timeframe where each experiment is conducted about 8 h increasing the calcium and magnesium concentration resulted in the decline of mass transfer coefficient mtc by the membrane analysing different membrane coupons from the experiment with a sudden decrease in mtc showed a high concentration of silica on some parts of the membrane and calcium on the other parts simulation with phreeqc software and results from membrane destruction pointed out that the formation potential of magnesium silica species is higher than calcium silica species at the given conditions and confirmed the findings of previous studies however the related mechanisms should be more widely investigated the current study reveals that silica scaling can be enhanced by magnesium ions probably by talc and or sepiolite formation under conditions similar to those in this study it is probably helpful to use the closed circuit reverse osmosis ccro techniques instead of continued conventional ro to reduce the concentrate volume without enhancing silica scaling using of ccro is the topic of our next study related to silica our forthcoming follow up study related to silica addresses the use of the closed circuit reverse osmosis ccro techniques instead of continued conventional ro to reduce the concentrate volume without enhancing silica scaling we also advise

8769,the textile industry causes massive water pollution as far as the color of textile wastewater is the most visible source of this pollution it is the most studied however could the color of textile wastewater be only the top of the issue could the problem be recognized as an iceberg effect why is color removal not comparable to mineralization this review paper tries to summarize the recent experience in the field of enhanced textile wastewater treatment the enhancement through catalytic action for dye removals and their by products was widely discussed the basis of catalytic effects was studied for ozone h2o2 electro photo and plasma based processes the synergistic effects in hybrid aops were discussed the authors ambition was to highlight the by products accumulation problem and emphasize the need for more advanced textile wastewater treatment hoping to avoid the occurrence of a new group of dye sourced micropollutants in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords textile wastewater dye by products hybrid aops catalytic ozonation electro oxidation plasma treatment 1 textile wastewater persistent by products toxicity due to a rapidly growing human population the amount of water used in industrial processes farming and living purposes persistently increases one area where water consumption is extremely high is the textile industry in 2017 the organization for economic co operation and development oecd revealed data concerning textile manufacturing according to the oecd report the textile industry is one of the most water consuming industrial branches simultaneously the report points out the necessity of preventive and corrective actions in water management within the textile branch closing the water loops in textile processing was recommended as the most promising approach which builds a sustainable circular economy 1 the idea to reuse the same water a few times in the production plant after cleaning it with a suitable treatment is the central circular water management guideline 2 this issue creates a vast field for investigation and the main questions that researchers should ask are how many times can the same water be used within the production plant is the accumulation of refractory compounds possible during wastewater recycling what kind of refractory compounds can occur due to wastewater recycling is there any way to identify and eliminate the secondary pollution risk is it possible to propose a solution within wastewater treatment to enhance the removal of burdensome persistent refractory compounds the textile wastewater treatment was the topic of numerous literature reports fig 1 a and many of them were devoted to wastewater recycling fig 1 b however not many papers dealt with refractory compounds that can occur after the treatment and only a few literature reports concern textile dye by products 3 7 moreover there is a lack of systematic studies concerning the causes of secondary pollutants occurrence and their influence on water recycling therefore the fundamental question should be asked is textile wastewater recycling safe recent scientific 8 9 and legal 1 reports forewarn that textile wastewater must be treated and reused because of enormous water employment within the textile branch the environmental damage caused by waste elution and water deficit it has to be kept in mind that average freshwater consumption in textile processing is 150 l per 1 kg of the product 9 10 however it can be as high as 933 l per 1 kg of textile product 9 a vivid example of how extensive textile production can affect the environment was revealed by bhatia and co workers the results in this study exposed that the rivers in the textile producing region of punjab india turned into textile wastewater sewers 8 on the other hand the quality requirements for textiles become excessive because of legal regulation such as reach and independent quality assurance systems such as oeko tex fair trade and eu flower nordic swan or gots all these systems obligate the manufacturers of textiles to keep an extra high standard production level each of these standards has a list of forbidden hazardous compounds that are not allowed to be introduced into textile products on any production stage table 1 moreover the legal list of substances forbidden in textile manufacturing was established 11 however all these listed substances originate from the group of textile assistance agents and their production components it means the substances that can be produced in textile wastewater recycling are not included and they are not even known the global community affiliated with the legal structure of the european union or international organizations such as oecd can see the dramatic need for intervention in the reduction of water consumption in the textile branch from one point of view their reports stress the necessity of water recycling 1 2 11 but from the other point of view the complexity of the issue and challenges for scientists in this field should be considered textiles production needs the use of extensive chemical processing therefore textile wastewater contains residues of detergents dyes and auxiliary agents resulting in extremely high alkalinity salinity and intense color these features are especially characteristic for dyeing effluent which makes this wastewater poorly biodegradable and the bod cod ratio under 0 4 disqualifies it for biological treatment 18 21 consequently this kind of wastewater can be problematic when is send to municipal treatment plants which are mostly biological based systems it can result in malfunctions of the treatment plant and the pollution of the environment when low biodegradability is concerned chemical treatment methods can be more suitable in wastewater purification the use of advanced oxidation processes aops where the combined action of highly oxidative species namely ozone 2 07 v and hydroxyl radicals 2 8 v for pollutants removal has been highly investigated for two recent decades extensive studies on color removal from simulated 22 40 and industrial 18 21 41 48 wastewater took place however it should be noticed that only a few authors dealt with by products detection 3 7 scaling up 49 or purified wastewater recycling 26 44 50 53 this review paper presents a literature overview of novel trends in aops for textile wastewater containing dyes enhanced purification the study s main objective was to stress out the novel methods for more effective oxidative species generation the paper shows the main groups of the most promising treatment methods for textile wastewater remediation consequently the processes where ozone electric power plasma radiation and acoustics were driving forces were specified but the hybrids of those processes might be a trend of cutting edge development moreover the role of catalysts and catalytic processes were discussed the effects of classic aops were compared to catalytic aops in terms of color and colorless pollutants removal from textile wastewater as far as the iceberg effect of textile wastewater treatment in which color removal is only the top of it and the rest of it stays hidden is concerned the comprehensive discussion on the enhanced removal of burdensome refractory compounds has been raised the authors aimed to show the role of newly developed aops in more efficient by products decomposition and toxicity remediation 2 overview of novel trends in aops aops are the group of the enhanced chemical treatments where hydroxyl radicals production is the common denominator as far as a few basic aops types are assumed as ozone based electro based h2o2 based some very traditional processes can be recognized the use of conventional fenton reagent h2o2 uv and ozone based aops was referred to as effective in color removal simultaneously referring to the literature aops can successfully decompose many organic compounds 54 however treating highly polluted textile wastewater was found to be a more complex issue surprisingly some of the traditional aops namely fenton reagent h2o2 uv were referred to be ineffective in industrial textile wastewater treatment 55 considering that aops are a powerful tool for pollution remediation recent trends in further development were discussed among aops many types of techniques can be regarded as catalytic the chemically photochemically or electrochemically active substances are introduced into the primary system to increase reactive oxidative species ros but this explanation does not cover the whole substance of the issue and is not sufficient to clarify these processes crux therefore a more profound discussion on a few groups of the techniques was speared within this review study simultaneously plasma radiation ultrasounds were discussed as an interesting medium in ros generation these media were especially favorable in hybrids and the hybrids seem to be the most promising trend in novel aops hybrids allow more various oxidative species production besides conventional reactive oxygen species ros the reactive nitrogen species rns or chlorine species or sulfate radicals sr can be recognized as a purpose of hybrids or catalytic processes the last mentioned sr has been recognized as a base of a new type of aop the sr aop 56 consequently based on the recent scientific trends on aops in which various oxidative species are generated table 2 the old definition could be supposedly re discussed 2 1 ozone based techniques ozone a powerful oxidizing agent giving a base to several ozone based treatments the ozonation of organic pollutants involves two types of oxidation reactions either molecular ozone reactions ozonolysis or hydroxyl radical reactions depending on the reaction conditions such as ph and the type of pollutant 62 64 at lower ph molecular ozone reactions are predominant where organic compounds are subjected to the electrophilic attack of ozone molecules in the presence of hydroxyl anion ho at high ph 8 ozone molecules are decomposed into free radicals o2 and ho2 and subsequently produces oh which will attack organic compounds 62 65 66 the processes are classified as aops because they employ hydroxyl radicals two groups can be distinguished the conventional o3 h2o2 and o3 h2o2 uv systems and the newer catalytic and photocatalytic ozonation although the treatment of textile wastewater by ozone based aops seems to be interesting to follow there is only a minor development field the literature brings a few publications focused on a comparison of several ozone based aops used with real wastewater chung kim 28 o3 h2o2 o3 uv o3 h2o2 uv azbar et al 46 o3 h2o2 o3 uv o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 uv fenton and coagulation bilińska et al 55 o3 o3 h2o2 o3 uv o3 h2o2 uv moreover there are several works concerning the treatment of dye solutions by aops 39 67 69 only one among these works considered the influence of salts a part of the textile wastewater matrix on the aops 69 arslan et al 70 and arslan alaton et al 30 used o3 based aops to purify a mixture of dyes and textile auxiliaries which simulated industrial wastewater after dyeing the works presented above referred to the synergistic effect of enhanced ros production brought by an interaction between o3 h2o2 and uv more precise information on synergistic action in ozone based aops can be found in supplementary materials a1 two types of catalytic ozonation were studies photo assisted and without external irradiation both types of catalytic ozonation are determined by enhanced production of hydroxyl radicals in these processes however the oh radicals production in catalytic and photocatalytic ozonation is not the only explanation of these processes crux and deeper discussion is needed in recent years the ozone self decomposition resulting in hydroxyl radicals oh production has been referred to as a catalytic action region in catalytic ozonation most often 71 but the basis of this action should be discussed following the type of catalyst homogenous or heterogenic catalysis is used for basic catalytic ozonation an example of homogenous catalysts is transition metal cations such as cr3 mn2 fe2 ni2 and zn2 they are responsible for oh production from enhanced ozone decomposition when both the metal cations and ozone molecules are dissolved in the liquid phase metal cations catalytic activity was explained as indirect ozone decomposition on the complex of metal pollutant 71 the electro potential of metal cations dissolved in bulk attract the organics building of a temporary complex subsequently the adsorption of ozone molecule on this temporary complex improves the self decomposition on the other hand the metal cation s direct activity on the ozone molecule was reported as a driving force of chain reactions leading to ozone self decomposition 71 in contrast to the homogenous system in heterogenic catalytic ozonation the catalyst is a solid body in this system the catalyst s adsorption ability has a crucial role and at least one of the reagents must be adsorbed on the catalyst surface the catalytic action in the process takes place when one of the presented activities occurs ozone is adsorbed on the catalyst surface a molecule of a pollutant is adsorbed on the catalyst or both ozone and pollutant are adsorbed on the surface 72 the main substances used as heterogenic catalysts are metal oxides minerals various forms of carbon and metals on the support 73 and some novel structural materials which have become more popular recently 74 75 the most commonly used in catalysis are metal oxides tio2 mno2 fe2o3 the transition metal oxides the use of al2o3 is also widespread in catalytic ozonation the bases of the catalytic action of metal oxides lie in the adsorptive properties related to active centers on the oxide of lewis acid character s surface simultaneously the hydroxyls which cover the metal oxide s surface are also considered adsorption centers because of their ion exchange properties 71 two routes of catalytic activity have been proposed for metals on the support one is pollutant organic molecule adsorption on the catalyst active center and then its oxidation by ozone or oh the second is ozone decomposition by electron transfer through reduced or oxidized metal sites deposited on the surface of supporting material and reported as efficient 72 the specific intermolecular effects of carbon can be used as a driving force of reagent catalyst interaction therefore carbon materials graphene graphite activated carbon granular carbon carbon black were often used in catalytic ozonation 76 78 the adsorption of organics and ozone decomposition on activated carbon takes place through basic character s active centers 76 79 80 in graphene the electrostatic attraction and π π interaction contribute to the adsorption process 81 the use of uv and vis irradiation created a vast investigation ground for photocatalytic ozonation consequently metal oxide semiconductors have traced a lot of interest in recent years because of their photo activity in this application at the root is uv light having an intensity higher than the bandgap energy after the uv exposition the electrons are promoted from valence band vb to conduction band cb leaving holes in the valence band therefore photochemically generated ros enrich ozonation in this process moreover photogenerated electrons can react directly with ozone for ros generation remarkably the use of tio2 zno ceo2 nb2o5 gave promising results in uv assisted photocatalysis combined with ozonation 82 84 the use of photocatalysts exhibits potential when solar energy can be applied to develop the ozone process this direction in photocatalysis can be reflected as a recent trend however moving photocatalysis from the uv region into solar light absorption needed some developments doping of tio2 with noble metals decreased the bandgap energy and brought the light absorption from uv into the visible radiation range 85 composites of different semiconductors heterojunction is the next improvement in photocatalysis in composites both components are excited or only one of them and free photogenerated electrons are transferred from one component to the cb of the other consequently recombination of h e pairs was limited and the overall photocatalytic efficiency of the composite material increased 86 87 a similar interaction was referred to when a semiconductor is supported on a carbonic scaffold graphene graphite activated carbon carbon nanotubes carbon nitride g c3n4 88 91 photoexcited electrons and holes can be transferred between components of the catalytic system a new trend in catalytic ozonation is undeniably the use of novel materials a great field for material science appears in the environmental application of new materials as catalysts and supports particularly promising are structural materials metal organic frameworks mofs metal layered double hydroxides ldh carbon aerogels porous metal oxides or modified minerals including plasma modified 74 75 92 96 it must be concluded that structural materials have started great alternatives to more traditional oxides or activated carbon when act as catalysts earth abundant metal oxides such as co3o4 nio and mno2 have been considered more often among promising alternatives to noble materials ru ir pd pt ag and au mostly because of their cost 94 97 98 2 2 electro based techniques electrochemical processes ec are considered environmentally friendly since they use the electron as a clean and efficient reagent without demanding the addition of further chemicals with high effectiveness in the elimination of organic contaminants 99 105 electrocoagulation ecg is a phase separation technology that has been known for more than a century however it had not been extensively applied to the treatment of water and wastewaters because of its high initial investment and energy costs nevertheless in the 21st century the prices of electricity as well as power sources have substantially lowered turning the ecg into a viable alternative for environmental purposes 104 107 109 this technology involves the electro dissolution of sacrificial anodes into an aqueous medium yielding metallic ions subsequently metal hydroxides are formed by the reaction of the yielded metal ions at the anode and the hydroxide released during the water reduction to hydrogen at the cathode it should be noticed that the distribution and solubility of the metallic ions and their hydroxo complexes are dependent on ph and ionic strength these ionic metal species and hydroxo complexes react with negatively charged particles in the water to form flocs which will have the power to destabilize and aggregate the suspended particles to precipitate trap or adsorb dissolved contaminants the electrocoagulation origin in electrode processes which result in the elution of metal cations and hydroxyl anions into a reaction bulk and in this way insoluble metal hydroxides fe oh 3 or al oh 3 which are coagulants can be generated in situ 110 due to this phenomenon coagulation takes place and contrary to ozone based treatments the pollutants can be moved from the liquid into the solid phase moreover the phenomenon of electroflotation can also take place when the hydrogen bubbles evolve at the cathode attaching the coagulated particles and transporting them to the surface of the solution where they can be separated 103 105 106 109 fig 2 a represents a scheme of the electrocoagulation process therefore it is possible to state that the ecg is based on the interaction of three conventional technologies combining their mechanisms and advantages chemical coagulation flotation and electrochemistry all of these are well known processes with a long period of research and development however the deep knowledge about the relation between these technologies in an ecg system is still somehow misty more studies on the core basis of electrocoagulation are required to develop a better understanding of this process as a whole the first studies on electrochemical oxidation eo for wastewater remediation were reported in the 19th century although its extensive investigation started in the 20th century focused on the electrochemical conversion destruction of organics during the past two decades many research groups all over the world have been devoted and are still involved in the discovery of the potentials of this process due to the evident relevance in developing new technologies to preserve water resources and the environment 100 102 104 111 114 the eo is the most popular treatment of contaminants among the electrochemical processes and it can occur through two different mechanisms direct oxidation where the pollutants are diffused from the bulk solution to the surface of the anode being oxidized thereby direct charge transfer processes indirect oxidation where the pollutants are indirectly oxidized by electrochemically generated oxidants these species are generated by the oxidation of a mediator on the surface of the anode that will react with the contaminants in the bulk the main disadvantage of direct oxidation is its catalytic activity decrease due to the poisoning effect caused by the development of a polymeric film on the electrode s surface the adsorption properties of the anode surface as well as the concentration and the nature of organic compounds and even their degradation intermediates are factors that influence the electrode deactivation this problem can be avoided if oxidation is accomplished in the potential region of water discharge with simultaneous oxygen evolution or by indirect electrochemical oxidation 102 105 in the indirect oxidation process the most common oxidants electrogenerated are the reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals ozone and hydrogen peroxide as well as different active species that depend on the electrolyte used for example if nacl is applied active chlorine species like cl2 hclo and clo are produced 102 105 112 115 116 the ideal electrode material for the degradation of organic pollutants should be stable in the electrolysis medium inexpensive and highly active towards organic oxidation while lowly active towards secondary reactions e g oxygen evolution reaction oer 105 117 in 1994 comninellis established a comprehensive model of the oxidation of organics in an acidic medium comprising the competition with the o2 evolution reaction as mentioned above the nature of the electrode material influences the selectivity and the efficiency of an electrochemical process for the oxidation of organic compounds and for this reason in literature several anodic materials have been tested to find the optimum one according to the model proposed by comninellis anode materials are divided for simplicity into two classes active and non active electrodes 103 105 106 109 this scheme was slightly modified over time and the different behaviour of the anodes in eo was explained by considering two limiting cases as in the schematic model in fig 2b the anode materials were classified into two big groups depending on the mainly electrogenerated species active anodes pt iro2 and ruo2 with low o2 overpotentials where chemisorbed radicals are preferentially formed and non active anodes with high o2 overpotentials where the hydroxyl radical remains physisorbed 105 106 on the other hand varying the electrode material makes it possible to form different oxidizing species and thus modify the oxidation pathway active anodes which present low oxygen evolution overpotential are good electrocatalysts for the oer and consequently lead to selective oxidation of the organic pollutants in this way some electrode materials such as carbon and graphite platinum based iridium based oxides and ruthenium based oxides can be considered in this classification on the other hand non active anodes which present high oxygen evolution overpotential are poor electrocatalysts for the oer and direct electrochemical oxidation is expected to occur for these electrodes also they present no higher oxidation state available and the organic species are directly oxidized by an adsorbed hydroxyl radical giving complete combustion electrochemical reduction er is another electrochemical technique that can be applied to remove dissolved pollutants from wastewaters as was mentioned in a traditional eo system the cathode is polarized to a potential low enough to catalyse h2 evolution reaction her 117 it is known that despite h2 positive impact during eo is also able to quench oh and reduce the direct oxidation efficiency therefore modifying cathodic reaction to being more energetic favorable became a reliable pathway for eo application to save energy and prevent h2 production cathodic her can be also modified into an oxygen reduction reaction orr to produce h2o or h2o2 the er process has received great attention owing to its ability to produce in situ h2o2 by cathodic reduction of oxygen 106 113 118 120 the in situ generated h2o2 1 77 v is a metastable molecule with high disinfecting and oxidizing properties 120 cathodic orr triggered h2o2 production has been widely applied in the electro peroxone e peroxone process 2 3 plasma based techniques the use of plasma based techniques has recently created a new field in wastewater treatment besides solid liquid and gas plasma is the fourth state of matter generally the moment of plasma initiation is the appearance of electrical conductivity instead of insulation abilities in the substance of gas it can happen when the average kinetic energies of the chemical particles in gas exceed their ionization potential subsequently the electrically conducting flux of both positively and negatively charged ions and numerous reactive species arise as a plasma the two types of plasma of a vast range of energy between 0 2 ev and 2 mev are possible the first type is a thermal plasma of high energy produced in thermonuclear reactions the second type is a non thermal cold plasma generated in the field of electrical discharges in non thermal plasma generation most of the electric energy result in highly energetic electrons production at the same time the flux of the gas is not heated and particles energy in this flux is between 0 2 ev and 3 ev free electrons are the driving force in cold plasma 121 consequently electron collisions and electronic excitation dissociation and ionization of the gas medium particles appear massively accordingly multiple phenomena such as electrohydraulic cavitation shockwave uv irradiation are characteristics of cold plasma flux simultaneously cold plasma can produce charged and metastable particles reactive oxygen species ros as free radicals h o ho and active molecules o3 h2o2 122 123 even though the plasma flux originated in noble carrier gas ar the nitrogen species is the same possible as ros when plasma contacting air 122 the most commonly air oxygen nitrogen or argon are used as a carrier gas to produce plasma 59 cold plasma has been more often used in water and wastewater treatment as a versatile technique of multiple actions combining oxidation uv photolysis and pyrolysis and the radicals action includes it to aops from the technical point of view the non thermal plasma ntp can be produced via corona discharge dielectric barrier discharge gliding arc discharge glow discharge plasma jet and spark discharge 59 124 in reactors of various types when water and wastewater treatment is concerned the plasma phase distribution into liquids can be executed in three general ways namely electrical discharges above the liquid surface direct electrical liquid discharges and discharges in bubbles vapor in liquids 124 according to plasma distribution into liquid phase and plasma generation way many examples of plasma based treatment can be demonstrated for textile dyes of which the most interesting was presented in table 3 concluding the use of ntp for dyes the main observation is the treatment of very basic dye components methyl orange 125 129 methylene blue 122 126 127 130 132 crystal violet 133 rhodamine b 134 indygo carmine 135 and congo red 127 are the most investigated however these dyes must be assumed as archives and have negligible use for industrial textile processing therefore the investigation of such objects has a more basic nature than practical significance the new field in ntp water wastewater treatment is using catalysts for enhancement the catalytic action of metal cations was reported fe2 cu2 when using jointly to ntp the activity exhibited by metal cation was assigned to fenton like reaction due to decomposition of in situ generated h2o2 132 136 137 promising results were referred to introduction of photocatalysts tio2 138 bipo4 133 into ntp water system then jointly action between ntp and photocatalyst was observed due to photo excitation of a catalyst with plasma generated uv this can be a great source of synergy resulting more efficient plasma uv utilization the next example is titanium dioxide graphene oxide nanomaterials tio2 go was used with ntp bdb type for acetaminophen degradation 139 ceo2 fe2o3 ceo2 and zro2 ceo2 were successfully used as catalysts for phenol ntp degradation 140 at the same time iervolino and coworkers investigated the generation of a greater number of micro discharges followed by enhanced ros production when fe2o3 immobilized glass spheres were introduced into the dbd ntp system 141 these promising synergistic effects caused by catalyst involvement in ntp treatment seem to encourage further investigation in this field since the plasma can be a tool in creating nanostructured catalytic materials 121 then new possibilities open for direct indirect plasma use in wastewater treatment when plasma created catalyst used in ntp treatment system an interesting solution of dbd corona hybrid reactor configuration for non thermal plasma production just right at the place of contact surface with the wastewater was presented by hafeez and co workers 142 however the plasma was used to produce ozone and have no contact with the liquid phase in did therefore the process was the ozonation 2 4 hybrid techniques a novel trend observed in wastewater treatment is the combined use of more than one basic process this tendency can be assumed as a group of treatments of hybrid action one of the first processes proposed in this group is fenton based treatments a combination of fenton reagent electric power and uv light gave the development in wastewater purification fenton based techniques were the first of hybrids and created the testing ground for finding more advanced synergistic effects a further testing ground for hybrids is combinations of techniques that are rarely used as a single process due to their insufficiency or high cost radiation microwaves and ultrasounds are more likely used as supporting components giving satisfactory results noteworthy can be a group of fully hybrid techniques in this group the core technology cannot be distinguished and it is a combination of at least two methods with an equipollent driving force in the overall process in this group electro assisted ozonation joint electrocoagulation and ozonation can be a good example 2 4 1 fenton based hybrids conventional fenton reagent h2o2 fe works mainly due to the in situ generation of ho the reactants in a classical fenton oxidation are ferrous ions fe 2 and hydrogen peroxide and the ho radicals are produced by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide 155 the fe 2 is being reconstituted through the following stages of fenton s reaction and considered to be a catalyst many variations of the fenton process can distinguish fig 3 the first attempts of multiple actions in fenton were initiated by uv introduction 70 156 satisfying results of photo fenton is due to extra hydrogen peroxide decomposition of uv and more efficient fe 2 ions recovery the basis of fenton and photo fenton was included in supplementary materials a2 the next step in fenton development was electric power employment for acceleration following ganzenko and co workers 157 depending on the source of substrates for the process a few types of electro fenton hybridization can be distinguished electro fenton with internal h2o2 generated on the electrode through oxygen reduction reaction orr described in 2 2 and external fe2 electrochemically regenerated fe3 fe2 158 fered fenton with external addition of both reagents and electrochemical recovery of fe2 159 160 peroxi coagulation with in situ internal electro generation of both reagents 161 electrochemical peroxidation with internal fe2 electro generation from sacrificial iron steel and external h2o2 addition 162 the variation of both the abovementioned electro fenton and photo fenton is photoelectro fenton moreover sonoelectro fenton can be found as a curious variety of fenton hybrid the recent trend in fenton s hybrid has been solar fenton as well as solar photoelectro fenton hybrid fig the last mentioned solar photoelectron fenton spef was found especially investigated table 4 following brillas 163 the main driving forces in this process are internal production of h2o2 on the cathode direct oh radical formation on the anode surface through anodic oxidation ao main fenton reaction between internal h2o2 and external fe2 electro recovery of fe3 into fe2 photochemical fe2 recovery by photoreduction of fe oh 2 photodecarboxylation of fe iii carboxylate species these multiple combined actions of spef were referred to be more efficient than other related processes pef ef ao tab when spef is used for real wastewater which contains chlorine and sulfur ions the production of other ros namely peroxodisulfate s2o8 2 ion and chlorine species cl2 hclo clo was referred to be advantageous in the process 163 another possible hybrid is photocatalysis photoelectron fenton name after 163 khataee and co workers used successfully catalysts carbon nanotubes 164 and zno 165 in the photoelectro fenton process for dyes removal the experimental set used by khataee and co workers fig 4 for photocatalysis photoelectron fenton is an excellent example of how the hybrid process can be run with multiple active elements 165 most of fenton examples including the ones mentioned above are classified as homogeneous fenton this means that fe2 ions are fully dissolved in the reaction bulk but heterogeneous fenton can also be found khataee and coworkers used pyrite as a source of iron ions in their sono fenton process 166 then the iron stays in the solid phase on surface of the mineral but following brillas 163 other hetero iron catalysts such as iron oxides deposited on polymer support beads or membranes α feooh znfe2o4 nanoparticles or iron modified electrodes can be distinguished the self imposing conclusion is that very conventional chemical reaction has been firstly exposed by j h fenton in 1889 has given a wide field for exploration conclusively the fenton hybridization can be raised like a recent trend in aops 2 4 2 radiation and acoustics as supportive actions since radiation and acoustics have limited application as self standing techniques in wastewater treatment because of cost or low efficiency they appear as an up and coming supportive source of action besides the visible and uv radiation types which are used in widespread photo based treatments ionizing and non ionizing radiation should be found as a creative field of wastewater purification the oxidation of pollutants in wastewater by ionizing radiation has been explored since the 1960s the ionizing radiation sources are radioactive elements such as 60co and 137cs producing ɣ or x rays 177 and electron beam from the accelerator 178 throughout ionizing radiation pollutants can be assailed in wastewater in two ways direct radiolysis or attack of water radiolysis by products the hydroxyl radical is the essential ros coming from radiative water decomposition therefore the radiation technique includes in aops 178 the most referred supportive action of radiolysis is the positive effect on bod cod ratio increasing textile wastewaters biodegradability consequently radiolysis has been reported as a stage in the sequence before biological treatment 179 180 or post treatment 181 however in fact the synergetic effect was investigated for radiolysis coupled with ozonolysis 182 or chemical oxidants hydrogen peroxide 178 183 184 chlorine potassium persulfate 185 the meaningful examples of the use of these techniques with an explanation of the source of synergy can be found in table 5 and types of radio based were shown in fig 5 a microwaves mw are an example of non ionizing low energy radiation willingly used in wastewater treatment fig 5b however the mw energy is too low to produce ros from water like in radiolysis 186 but mw is used in hybrid techniques for enhancement purposes by causing thermal and non thermal effects the non thermal effect can be exceptionally interesting in aops when mw introduced into water are absorbed by chemical oxidant it can induce the hot spots producing oh radicals the mw energy absorption causes the vibration and rotations on the molecular level when molecular excitation is included the oxidant is keen on breaking through the polar bond producing ros 186 however the thermal effect is also causative because it improves the reactivity of the chemical reaction the hybrid of mw and uv in the presence of chemical oxidants and catalysts was referred to be successful in dyes decomposition 187 subsequently the interaction between mw and catalysts solid body was assumed to surface interaction polarization and π electrons delocalization resulting in catalyst s activation 188 189 consequently the mw is the originator of multiple synergetic actions especially when combined with chemical oxidant radical precursor catalysts or uv 56 recent examples of synergies in mw hybrids for dye decontamination were presented in table 5 the use of ultrasounds can be assumed as the next type of aop nevertheless the chemical effect does not directly from the us wave with the pollutant but rather from the us s impact in developing acoustic cavitation in liquids cavitation is an interesting phenomenon of formation growing and collapsing in an implosive way of gaseous or vapor bubbles in the liquid the implosive collapse creates the hot spots for water dissociation and ros formation 190 non inertial acoustic cavitation by us application finds a wide application in wastewater treatment 190 however the inertial hydrodynamic cavitation caused by sudden pressure drop is also possible it is an adverse effect on mechanics in rotors and pumping units the us is more likely used in hybrid techniques subsection 2 7 than a single treatment low efficiency for single us 177 the most likely in a combination of sonolysis and photocatalysis 191 the synergistic effect of sonolysis and photocatalysis was first investigated as an effect of positive us interaction with catalyst surface resulting in higher catalytic yield 191 over time the extra irradiation from the us sonoluminescence and chemiluminescence was referred to in the us uv hybrid s overall synergistic effect 192 the types of us hybridization in aops were shown in fig 5c 2 4 3 total hybrid the combustion of ozonation and electrochemical treatments creates a group of totally hybrid processes in which both components are equivalent in action no core technique can be distinguished because the ozone electro combination gives a new impact not observed when investigated separately the first progenitor in this group is ozone assisted electrocoagulation o3 and ec combination and the follow up method electrochemical ozonation electro oxidation or electrochemical reduction combined with o3 several studies integrated the ozonation process with ec process to form an electrolysis ozone eco process for the treatment of distillery industrial effluent 199 textile wastewater 101 200 202 mixed industrial wastewater from an industrial park 116 and greywater 99 120 with the use of the iron anode when ozone bubbled into the ec aqueous solution fe eco process redox reactions took place initiating an electro fenton like process 203 204 consequently the eco process exhibited higher organic removal efficiency compared with the ozonation and ecg process 199 it was revealed that the possible reactions in the fe eco process included homogeneous catalytic ozonation peroxone reactions fenton reactions molecular ozone oxidation and coagulation 204 homogeneous catalytic ozonation and fenton reactions were dominant reactions in the fe eco process under initial ph 3 and homogeneous catalytic ozonation and peroxone reactions were pivotal reactions in the fe eco process under initial ph 6 6 204 despite the structural similarities the interactions between electrolytically generated hydrolyzed metal species and ozone were not considered in the previously proposed eco process nevertheless besides al and fe electrodes most of the electrodes in the ec process could be stable electrodes such as electrodes doped by noble metals pt pd rh ru or low cost and durable earth abundant metal oxide fe ti co zn ni 112 118 121 205 208 the organic removal using the stable anodes is mainly through direct electron transfer from organic matter and water oxidation to form oh on the surface of anodes besides most studies applied iron anodes for the treatment of industrial wastewater 101 199 or greywater 99 120 in the eo or e peroxone processes nevertheless the al based electrodes are the most commonly used electrode in water and wastewater treatment 209 210 antimony doped tin oxide lead dioxide pbo2 and boron doped diamond bdd are considered non active anodes and therefore the most suitable for electrochemical combustion reactions 103 105 106 109 bdd electrodes and titanium based metal oxide electrodes are widely used 104 105 120 206 211 212 compared with other conventional anodes bdd has a higher oer and better oxidation performance 105 120 211 but its preparation is complicated and costly especially for that with a large area moreover the bdd surface is chemically inert with high surface resistance so that its applied cell voltage is increased as aforementioned several works have been published in the ec field for the depuration of the organic compound using mainly al and fe electrodes however literature is still scarce in what regards this process using other sacrificial electrodes to depurate complex synthetic mixtures and real wastewaters in the case of the eo different less costly electrodes should be tested to avoid the dependence on the expensive bdd electrodes the study of other reactor configurations able to improve efficiency while reducing energy consumption is still a field for research in both electrochemical processes 3 examples of dye decomposition by products besides pharmaceuticals preserves pesticides textile dyes are one of the most investigated groups of pollutants numerous research papers on a vast number of dyes can find literature there is no wonder if there are over 100 000 types of commercial dyes and over 800 000 tons of dye related goods are produced annually 81 for a deeper understanding it must be mentioned that dyes soluble in water include the group of colorants the same as pigments insoluble in water 213 from a chemical point of view commercial dyes are mostly synthetic compounds of the organic basin there are two fundamental classifications of colorants to follow first created to chemical structure and second related to applicability the first classification core is associated with the chemical structure of dye chromophore therefore several chemical groups can be distinguished from the simplest polyenes then azo including metal complex carbonyl indigo type anthraquinone and others the classification related to fiber applicability is more transparent more commonly used and has a practical meaning consequently the following groups were distinguished disperse for polyester acid for polyamide wool silk direct and reactive for cotton and viscose cationic for acrylic and others such as sulfur vat mordant 213 as far as this classification is meaningful it was the basis of the color index catalog this strictly defined register established jointly by the society of dyers and colourists uk and the american association of textile chemists and colorists usa allows for smoothly navigating the issue of colorants afterward all registered colorants have their systematic name following the c i generic name template the authors aimed to put more light on the issue of the need for more enhanced dye removal from the environment this paper stresses out the possibility of the toxic by products appearance as a consequence of insufficient purification keeping in mind the vast number of textile dyes it has to follow some chosen examples the methylene blue and reactive black 5 were selected as representatives 3 1 methylene blue methylene blue c i basic blue 9 is one of the thiazine dyes the oxidation of dimethyl 4 phenylenediamine drives a simple synthesis supported by sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 leading to mb production mb was used in the textile industry until the 1880s for silk dyeing the use of mb in textiles has been discontinued because of low light fastness 213 nowadays mb is mainly used in analytical applications e g microscope sample staining together with other very basic dyes such as congo red methyl orange cristal violet rhodamine b create a group of archaic colorants without a practical meaning in the textile industry even though the vast number of research papers deal with the aforementioned dyes purification these investigations give more basic than practical knowledge consequently these dyes cannot be found in industrial textile wastewater table 6 presents by products detected during mb degradation the leucomethylene blue sulfoxide m z 301 amu and the leucomethylene blue sulfone m z 317 amu were referred as the by product characteristic for the first stage of oxidative degradation originated in oh radical 215 216 following by products specified for oxidative action of oh radical were by m z 303 230 218 165 158 157 amu 215 217 a very interesting mb degradation path way was proposed by bansode and co workes 126 based on ftir analysis and lcms pattern ten by products m z 270 256 242 228 amu and other less specific were detected in this study these data were collected for 15 min of ntp treatment as far as plasma was a driving force in this treatment the multiple actions of o3 o o 2 ros ron occurred in this study based on optical emission of plasma spectrum the plasma driven by products differ from those generated by oh radical moreover the positive effect on toxicity was proven for plasma treated mb by no inhibition of growth of e coli 126 preliminary it can be concluded that depending on oxidizing agent specific by products occurred at the same time the characteristic by products the evidential through which mother pollutant could be recognized these occur in the first stage of treatment 8 10 min then non evidential by products could be found more often simple compounds such as phenol 126 214 217 moreover non evidential by products are not related to the treatment type 3 2 reactive black 5 the second example for the discussion reactive black 5 rb5 was chosen as an antitype for mb in contrast to mb rb5 is a dye of great practical meaning in the textile industry rb5 is the most popular textile dye with the highest tonnage production in the world this dye is the basic component of most industrial black dyeing products e g remazol ultra black nn remazol midnight black rgb remazol onyx rgb dystar cibacron navy dp b cibacron navy w b ciba specialty chemicals inc levafix black e b bayer group sumifix black b150 sumitomo chemical co ltd and far more more than one hundred black textile dyes are originated on the base of rb5 rb5 in a dis azo reactive dye the chromophore consists of two twin azo groups linked to aromatic sp2 hybridized atoms of carbon this colored core is equipped in two groups vinyl sulfone precursor so2ch2ch2oso3h able to the covalent bond formation with the cellulosic substrate 213 the parent compounds for rb5 synthesis are 4 2 sulfatoethyl sulfonyl aniline sodium salt p ester and 4 amino 5 hydroxynaphthalene 2 7 disulphonic acid sodium salt h acid consequently rb5 is typical representative of azo dyes based on letter acid as far as the products for the rb5 synthesis are concerned their reflections are the by products of decomposition therefore the h acid derivatives and aniline derivatives were observed as by products table 7 the characteristic of rb5 is the hydrolysis of vinyl sulphonyl reactive groups taking place during the dyeing process this adverse feature makes the low fixation level of rb5 dye followed by a high content of wasted dye in wastewater up to 40 therefore the hydrolyzed rb5 form should be expected in industrial wastewater 221 further oxidizing of rb5 in wastewater brings oxidation of azo chromophore notably the use of ozone resulted in azo bond destruction the selectivity of molecular ozone explained this in oxidation and its affinity to attract the moiety of high molecular density 23 26 222 but when hydroxyl radical is the primary oxidant in the system which is highly non selective the by products related to azo bond braking occur 218 220 the following colorless by products are derivatives of h acid and para ester 4 202 218 220 therefore it would be tough to conclude if a specific degradation pathway depends on the treatment type the presented scheme could also be observed for other similarly build azo dyes such as direct red 81 dr81 169 or reactive blue 171 223 and other azo dyes 224 the problematic issue is the low molecular weight by products such as phenol naphthol aromatic amines they were shown as resistant to ozone and ozone based aops and what is more they were proved to be able to accumulation during multiple recycling 200 however a few preliminary studies are devoted to enhanced by product removal bilińska et al 2020c 2020a lucyna bilińska et al 2019a a wide gap needs to be fulfilled in the area of enhanced by product removal the most vivid argument is low toc removal during aops while color was removed entirely 225 rb5 is one of the few dyes with the quantified value of toxicity the ec50 value was determined for this dye between 3 86 0 32 mg l 55 and 4 9 1 45 mg l 226 in the form of sodium salt at the same time it was investigated that ozone based aops o3 h2o2 o3 uv o3 and uv o3 h2o2 decreased the toxicity of rb5 in water solution and in textile wastewater 55 the promising results were also referred for catalytic ozonation 202 4 conclusions this review presents the recent trends in aops the main aim of this work was to stress out the areas for further research catalytic ozonation electrochemical oxidation and plasma were shown as the most promising core aops but then what should be considered as the broadest testing ground for further investigation is the hybrids the synergies between a few active factors were shown to be beneficial the supportive action of catalysts uv mw or us jointed with traditional techniques fenton ozonation or electrocoagulation was referred to as more effective higher efficiency in color cod toc removal was the advantage of catalytic processes and hybrids at the same time the decrease in toxicity and specific degradation pathway of treated dyes indicated the benefits of novel aops the field for development is the creation of new materials modern structural materials expanded in the nanoscale give new opportunities to create new catalysts or new electrodes it was shown not only oxygen based reactive species ros are meaningful in modern aops the traditional aops have already been redefined the generation of nitrogen sulfur chlorine reactive species has become more frequently the target of aops the most significant gap that needs to be covered seems to be plasma treatment plasma has not been often used so far in textile wastewater treatment while plasma itself allows massive production of various reactive species it can be further improved by introducing a catalyst the authors believe that novel plasma catalytic hybrid aops allow more efficient textile wastewater treatment and reuse credit

8769,the textile industry causes massive water pollution as far as the color of textile wastewater is the most visible source of this pollution it is the most studied however could the color of textile wastewater be only the top of the issue could the problem be recognized as an iceberg effect why is color removal not comparable to mineralization this review paper tries to summarize the recent experience in the field of enhanced textile wastewater treatment the enhancement through catalytic action for dye removals and their by products was widely discussed the basis of catalytic effects was studied for ozone h2o2 electro photo and plasma based processes the synergistic effects in hybrid aops were discussed the authors ambition was to highlight the by products accumulation problem and emphasize the need for more advanced textile wastewater treatment hoping to avoid the occurrence of a new group of dye sourced micropollutants in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords textile wastewater dye by products hybrid aops catalytic ozonation electro oxidation plasma treatment 1 textile wastewater persistent by products toxicity due to a rapidly growing human population the amount of water used in industrial processes farming and living purposes persistently increases one area where water consumption is extremely high is the textile industry in 2017 the organization for economic co operation and development oecd revealed data concerning textile manufacturing according to the oecd report the textile industry is one of the most water consuming industrial branches simultaneously the report points out the necessity of preventive and corrective actions in water management within the textile branch closing the water loops in textile processing was recommended as the most promising approach which builds a sustainable circular economy 1 the idea to reuse the same water a few times in the production plant after cleaning it with a suitable treatment is the central circular water management guideline 2 this issue creates a vast field for investigation and the main questions that researchers should ask are how many times can the same water be used within the production plant is the accumulation of refractory compounds possible during wastewater recycling what kind of refractory compounds can occur due to wastewater recycling is there any way to identify and eliminate the secondary pollution risk is it possible to propose a solution within wastewater treatment to enhance the removal of burdensome persistent refractory compounds the textile wastewater treatment was the topic of numerous literature reports fig 1 a and many of them were devoted to wastewater recycling fig 1 b however not many papers dealt with refractory compounds that can occur after the treatment and only a few literature reports concern textile dye by products 3 7 moreover there is a lack of systematic studies concerning the causes of secondary pollutants occurrence and their influence on water recycling therefore the fundamental question should be asked is textile wastewater recycling safe recent scientific 8 9 and legal 1 reports forewarn that textile wastewater must be treated and reused because of enormous water employment within the textile branch the environmental damage caused by waste elution and water deficit it has to be kept in mind that average freshwater consumption in textile processing is 150 l per 1 kg of the product 9 10 however it can be as high as 933 l per 1 kg of textile product 9 a vivid example of how extensive textile production can affect the environment was revealed by bhatia and co workers the results in this study exposed that the rivers in the textile producing region of punjab india turned into textile wastewater sewers 8 on the other hand the quality requirements for textiles become excessive because of legal regulation such as reach and independent quality assurance systems such as oeko tex fair trade and eu flower nordic swan or gots all these systems obligate the manufacturers of textiles to keep an extra high standard production level each of these standards has a list of forbidden hazardous compounds that are not allowed to be introduced into textile products on any production stage table 1 moreover the legal list of substances forbidden in textile manufacturing was established 11 however all these listed substances originate from the group of textile assistance agents and their production components it means the substances that can be produced in textile wastewater recycling are not included and they are not even known the global community affiliated with the legal structure of the european union or international organizations such as oecd can see the dramatic need for intervention in the reduction of water consumption in the textile branch from one point of view their reports stress the necessity of water recycling 1 2 11 but from the other point of view the complexity of the issue and challenges for scientists in this field should be considered textiles production needs the use of extensive chemical processing therefore textile wastewater contains residues of detergents dyes and auxiliary agents resulting in extremely high alkalinity salinity and intense color these features are especially characteristic for dyeing effluent which makes this wastewater poorly biodegradable and the bod cod ratio under 0 4 disqualifies it for biological treatment 18 21 consequently this kind of wastewater can be problematic when is send to municipal treatment plants which are mostly biological based systems it can result in malfunctions of the treatment plant and the pollution of the environment when low biodegradability is concerned chemical treatment methods can be more suitable in wastewater purification the use of advanced oxidation processes aops where the combined action of highly oxidative species namely ozone 2 07 v and hydroxyl radicals 2 8 v for pollutants removal has been highly investigated for two recent decades extensive studies on color removal from simulated 22 40 and industrial 18 21 41 48 wastewater took place however it should be noticed that only a few authors dealt with by products detection 3 7 scaling up 49 or purified wastewater recycling 26 44 50 53 this review paper presents a literature overview of novel trends in aops for textile wastewater containing dyes enhanced purification the study s main objective was to stress out the novel methods for more effective oxidative species generation the paper shows the main groups of the most promising treatment methods for textile wastewater remediation consequently the processes where ozone electric power plasma radiation and acoustics were driving forces were specified but the hybrids of those processes might be a trend of cutting edge development moreover the role of catalysts and catalytic processes were discussed the effects of classic aops were compared to catalytic aops in terms of color and colorless pollutants removal from textile wastewater as far as the iceberg effect of textile wastewater treatment in which color removal is only the top of it and the rest of it stays hidden is concerned the comprehensive discussion on the enhanced removal of burdensome refractory compounds has been raised the authors aimed to show the role of newly developed aops in more efficient by products decomposition and toxicity remediation 2 overview of novel trends in aops aops are the group of the enhanced chemical treatments where hydroxyl radicals production is the common denominator as far as a few basic aops types are assumed as ozone based electro based h2o2 based some very traditional processes can be recognized the use of conventional fenton reagent h2o2 uv and ozone based aops was referred to as effective in color removal simultaneously referring to the literature aops can successfully decompose many organic compounds 54 however treating highly polluted textile wastewater was found to be a more complex issue surprisingly some of the traditional aops namely fenton reagent h2o2 uv were referred to be ineffective in industrial textile wastewater treatment 55 considering that aops are a powerful tool for pollution remediation recent trends in further development were discussed among aops many types of techniques can be regarded as catalytic the chemically photochemically or electrochemically active substances are introduced into the primary system to increase reactive oxidative species ros but this explanation does not cover the whole substance of the issue and is not sufficient to clarify these processes crux therefore a more profound discussion on a few groups of the techniques was speared within this review study simultaneously plasma radiation ultrasounds were discussed as an interesting medium in ros generation these media were especially favorable in hybrids and the hybrids seem to be the most promising trend in novel aops hybrids allow more various oxidative species production besides conventional reactive oxygen species ros the reactive nitrogen species rns or chlorine species or sulfate radicals sr can be recognized as a purpose of hybrids or catalytic processes the last mentioned sr has been recognized as a base of a new type of aop the sr aop 56 consequently based on the recent scientific trends on aops in which various oxidative species are generated table 2 the old definition could be supposedly re discussed 2 1 ozone based techniques ozone a powerful oxidizing agent giving a base to several ozone based treatments the ozonation of organic pollutants involves two types of oxidation reactions either molecular ozone reactions ozonolysis or hydroxyl radical reactions depending on the reaction conditions such as ph and the type of pollutant 62 64 at lower ph molecular ozone reactions are predominant where organic compounds are subjected to the electrophilic attack of ozone molecules in the presence of hydroxyl anion ho at high ph 8 ozone molecules are decomposed into free radicals o2 and ho2 and subsequently produces oh which will attack organic compounds 62 65 66 the processes are classified as aops because they employ hydroxyl radicals two groups can be distinguished the conventional o3 h2o2 and o3 h2o2 uv systems and the newer catalytic and photocatalytic ozonation although the treatment of textile wastewater by ozone based aops seems to be interesting to follow there is only a minor development field the literature brings a few publications focused on a comparison of several ozone based aops used with real wastewater chung kim 28 o3 h2o2 o3 uv o3 h2o2 uv azbar et al 46 o3 h2o2 o3 uv o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 uv fenton and coagulation bilińska et al 55 o3 o3 h2o2 o3 uv o3 h2o2 uv moreover there are several works concerning the treatment of dye solutions by aops 39 67 69 only one among these works considered the influence of salts a part of the textile wastewater matrix on the aops 69 arslan et al 70 and arslan alaton et al 30 used o3 based aops to purify a mixture of dyes and textile auxiliaries which simulated industrial wastewater after dyeing the works presented above referred to the synergistic effect of enhanced ros production brought by an interaction between o3 h2o2 and uv more precise information on synergistic action in ozone based aops can be found in supplementary materials a1 two types of catalytic ozonation were studies photo assisted and without external irradiation both types of catalytic ozonation are determined by enhanced production of hydroxyl radicals in these processes however the oh radicals production in catalytic and photocatalytic ozonation is not the only explanation of these processes crux and deeper discussion is needed in recent years the ozone self decomposition resulting in hydroxyl radicals oh production has been referred to as a catalytic action region in catalytic ozonation most often 71 but the basis of this action should be discussed following the type of catalyst homogenous or heterogenic catalysis is used for basic catalytic ozonation an example of homogenous catalysts is transition metal cations such as cr3 mn2 fe2 ni2 and zn2 they are responsible for oh production from enhanced ozone decomposition when both the metal cations and ozone molecules are dissolved in the liquid phase metal cations catalytic activity was explained as indirect ozone decomposition on the complex of metal pollutant 71 the electro potential of metal cations dissolved in bulk attract the organics building of a temporary complex subsequently the adsorption of ozone molecule on this temporary complex improves the self decomposition on the other hand the metal cation s direct activity on the ozone molecule was reported as a driving force of chain reactions leading to ozone self decomposition 71 in contrast to the homogenous system in heterogenic catalytic ozonation the catalyst is a solid body in this system the catalyst s adsorption ability has a crucial role and at least one of the reagents must be adsorbed on the catalyst surface the catalytic action in the process takes place when one of the presented activities occurs ozone is adsorbed on the catalyst surface a molecule of a pollutant is adsorbed on the catalyst or both ozone and pollutant are adsorbed on the surface 72 the main substances used as heterogenic catalysts are metal oxides minerals various forms of carbon and metals on the support 73 and some novel structural materials which have become more popular recently 74 75 the most commonly used in catalysis are metal oxides tio2 mno2 fe2o3 the transition metal oxides the use of al2o3 is also widespread in catalytic ozonation the bases of the catalytic action of metal oxides lie in the adsorptive properties related to active centers on the oxide of lewis acid character s surface simultaneously the hydroxyls which cover the metal oxide s surface are also considered adsorption centers because of their ion exchange properties 71 two routes of catalytic activity have been proposed for metals on the support one is pollutant organic molecule adsorption on the catalyst active center and then its oxidation by ozone or oh the second is ozone decomposition by electron transfer through reduced or oxidized metal sites deposited on the surface of supporting material and reported as efficient 72 the specific intermolecular effects of carbon can be used as a driving force of reagent catalyst interaction therefore carbon materials graphene graphite activated carbon granular carbon carbon black were often used in catalytic ozonation 76 78 the adsorption of organics and ozone decomposition on activated carbon takes place through basic character s active centers 76 79 80 in graphene the electrostatic attraction and π π interaction contribute to the adsorption process 81 the use of uv and vis irradiation created a vast investigation ground for photocatalytic ozonation consequently metal oxide semiconductors have traced a lot of interest in recent years because of their photo activity in this application at the root is uv light having an intensity higher than the bandgap energy after the uv exposition the electrons are promoted from valence band vb to conduction band cb leaving holes in the valence band therefore photochemically generated ros enrich ozonation in this process moreover photogenerated electrons can react directly with ozone for ros generation remarkably the use of tio2 zno ceo2 nb2o5 gave promising results in uv assisted photocatalysis combined with ozonation 82 84 the use of photocatalysts exhibits potential when solar energy can be applied to develop the ozone process this direction in photocatalysis can be reflected as a recent trend however moving photocatalysis from the uv region into solar light absorption needed some developments doping of tio2 with noble metals decreased the bandgap energy and brought the light absorption from uv into the visible radiation range 85 composites of different semiconductors heterojunction is the next improvement in photocatalysis in composites both components are excited or only one of them and free photogenerated electrons are transferred from one component to the cb of the other consequently recombination of h e pairs was limited and the overall photocatalytic efficiency of the composite material increased 86 87 a similar interaction was referred to when a semiconductor is supported on a carbonic scaffold graphene graphite activated carbon carbon nanotubes carbon nitride g c3n4 88 91 photoexcited electrons and holes can be transferred between components of the catalytic system a new trend in catalytic ozonation is undeniably the use of novel materials a great field for material science appears in the environmental application of new materials as catalysts and supports particularly promising are structural materials metal organic frameworks mofs metal layered double hydroxides ldh carbon aerogels porous metal oxides or modified minerals including plasma modified 74 75 92 96 it must be concluded that structural materials have started great alternatives to more traditional oxides or activated carbon when act as catalysts earth abundant metal oxides such as co3o4 nio and mno2 have been considered more often among promising alternatives to noble materials ru ir pd pt ag and au mostly because of their cost 94 97 98 2 2 electro based techniques electrochemical processes ec are considered environmentally friendly since they use the electron as a clean and efficient reagent without demanding the addition of further chemicals with high effectiveness in the elimination of organic contaminants 99 105 electrocoagulation ecg is a phase separation technology that has been known for more than a century however it had not been extensively applied to the treatment of water and wastewaters because of its high initial investment and energy costs nevertheless in the 21st century the prices of electricity as well as power sources have substantially lowered turning the ecg into a viable alternative for environmental purposes 104 107 109 this technology involves the electro dissolution of sacrificial anodes into an aqueous medium yielding metallic ions subsequently metal hydroxides are formed by the reaction of the yielded metal ions at the anode and the hydroxide released during the water reduction to hydrogen at the cathode it should be noticed that the distribution and solubility of the metallic ions and their hydroxo complexes are dependent on ph and ionic strength these ionic metal species and hydroxo complexes react with negatively charged particles in the water to form flocs which will have the power to destabilize and aggregate the suspended particles to precipitate trap or adsorb dissolved contaminants the electrocoagulation origin in electrode processes which result in the elution of metal cations and hydroxyl anions into a reaction bulk and in this way insoluble metal hydroxides fe oh 3 or al oh 3 which are coagulants can be generated in situ 110 due to this phenomenon coagulation takes place and contrary to ozone based treatments the pollutants can be moved from the liquid into the solid phase moreover the phenomenon of electroflotation can also take place when the hydrogen bubbles evolve at the cathode attaching the coagulated particles and transporting them to the surface of the solution where they can be separated 103 105 106 109 fig 2 a represents a scheme of the electrocoagulation process therefore it is possible to state that the ecg is based on the interaction of three conventional technologies combining their mechanisms and advantages chemical coagulation flotation and electrochemistry all of these are well known processes with a long period of research and development however the deep knowledge about the relation between these technologies in an ecg system is still somehow misty more studies on the core basis of electrocoagulation are required to develop a better understanding of this process as a whole the first studies on electrochemical oxidation eo for wastewater remediation were reported in the 19th century although its extensive investigation started in the 20th century focused on the electrochemical conversion destruction of organics during the past two decades many research groups all over the world have been devoted and are still involved in the discovery of the potentials of this process due to the evident relevance in developing new technologies to preserve water resources and the environment 100 102 104 111 114 the eo is the most popular treatment of contaminants among the electrochemical processes and it can occur through two different mechanisms direct oxidation where the pollutants are diffused from the bulk solution to the surface of the anode being oxidized thereby direct charge transfer processes indirect oxidation where the pollutants are indirectly oxidized by electrochemically generated oxidants these species are generated by the oxidation of a mediator on the surface of the anode that will react with the contaminants in the bulk the main disadvantage of direct oxidation is its catalytic activity decrease due to the poisoning effect caused by the development of a polymeric film on the electrode s surface the adsorption properties of the anode surface as well as the concentration and the nature of organic compounds and even their degradation intermediates are factors that influence the electrode deactivation this problem can be avoided if oxidation is accomplished in the potential region of water discharge with simultaneous oxygen evolution or by indirect electrochemical oxidation 102 105 in the indirect oxidation process the most common oxidants electrogenerated are the reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals ozone and hydrogen peroxide as well as different active species that depend on the electrolyte used for example if nacl is applied active chlorine species like cl2 hclo and clo are produced 102 105 112 115 116 the ideal electrode material for the degradation of organic pollutants should be stable in the electrolysis medium inexpensive and highly active towards organic oxidation while lowly active towards secondary reactions e g oxygen evolution reaction oer 105 117 in 1994 comninellis established a comprehensive model of the oxidation of organics in an acidic medium comprising the competition with the o2 evolution reaction as mentioned above the nature of the electrode material influences the selectivity and the efficiency of an electrochemical process for the oxidation of organic compounds and for this reason in literature several anodic materials have been tested to find the optimum one according to the model proposed by comninellis anode materials are divided for simplicity into two classes active and non active electrodes 103 105 106 109 this scheme was slightly modified over time and the different behaviour of the anodes in eo was explained by considering two limiting cases as in the schematic model in fig 2b the anode materials were classified into two big groups depending on the mainly electrogenerated species active anodes pt iro2 and ruo2 with low o2 overpotentials where chemisorbed radicals are preferentially formed and non active anodes with high o2 overpotentials where the hydroxyl radical remains physisorbed 105 106 on the other hand varying the electrode material makes it possible to form different oxidizing species and thus modify the oxidation pathway active anodes which present low oxygen evolution overpotential are good electrocatalysts for the oer and consequently lead to selective oxidation of the organic pollutants in this way some electrode materials such as carbon and graphite platinum based iridium based oxides and ruthenium based oxides can be considered in this classification on the other hand non active anodes which present high oxygen evolution overpotential are poor electrocatalysts for the oer and direct electrochemical oxidation is expected to occur for these electrodes also they present no higher oxidation state available and the organic species are directly oxidized by an adsorbed hydroxyl radical giving complete combustion electrochemical reduction er is another electrochemical technique that can be applied to remove dissolved pollutants from wastewaters as was mentioned in a traditional eo system the cathode is polarized to a potential low enough to catalyse h2 evolution reaction her 117 it is known that despite h2 positive impact during eo is also able to quench oh and reduce the direct oxidation efficiency therefore modifying cathodic reaction to being more energetic favorable became a reliable pathway for eo application to save energy and prevent h2 production cathodic her can be also modified into an oxygen reduction reaction orr to produce h2o or h2o2 the er process has received great attention owing to its ability to produce in situ h2o2 by cathodic reduction of oxygen 106 113 118 120 the in situ generated h2o2 1 77 v is a metastable molecule with high disinfecting and oxidizing properties 120 cathodic orr triggered h2o2 production has been widely applied in the electro peroxone e peroxone process 2 3 plasma based techniques the use of plasma based techniques has recently created a new field in wastewater treatment besides solid liquid and gas plasma is the fourth state of matter generally the moment of plasma initiation is the appearance of electrical conductivity instead of insulation abilities in the substance of gas it can happen when the average kinetic energies of the chemical particles in gas exceed their ionization potential subsequently the electrically conducting flux of both positively and negatively charged ions and numerous reactive species arise as a plasma the two types of plasma of a vast range of energy between 0 2 ev and 2 mev are possible the first type is a thermal plasma of high energy produced in thermonuclear reactions the second type is a non thermal cold plasma generated in the field of electrical discharges in non thermal plasma generation most of the electric energy result in highly energetic electrons production at the same time the flux of the gas is not heated and particles energy in this flux is between 0 2 ev and 3 ev free electrons are the driving force in cold plasma 121 consequently electron collisions and electronic excitation dissociation and ionization of the gas medium particles appear massively accordingly multiple phenomena such as electrohydraulic cavitation shockwave uv irradiation are characteristics of cold plasma flux simultaneously cold plasma can produce charged and metastable particles reactive oxygen species ros as free radicals h o ho and active molecules o3 h2o2 122 123 even though the plasma flux originated in noble carrier gas ar the nitrogen species is the same possible as ros when plasma contacting air 122 the most commonly air oxygen nitrogen or argon are used as a carrier gas to produce plasma 59 cold plasma has been more often used in water and wastewater treatment as a versatile technique of multiple actions combining oxidation uv photolysis and pyrolysis and the radicals action includes it to aops from the technical point of view the non thermal plasma ntp can be produced via corona discharge dielectric barrier discharge gliding arc discharge glow discharge plasma jet and spark discharge 59 124 in reactors of various types when water and wastewater treatment is concerned the plasma phase distribution into liquids can be executed in three general ways namely electrical discharges above the liquid surface direct electrical liquid discharges and discharges in bubbles vapor in liquids 124 according to plasma distribution into liquid phase and plasma generation way many examples of plasma based treatment can be demonstrated for textile dyes of which the most interesting was presented in table 3 concluding the use of ntp for dyes the main observation is the treatment of very basic dye components methyl orange 125 129 methylene blue 122 126 127 130 132 crystal violet 133 rhodamine b 134 indygo carmine 135 and congo red 127 are the most investigated however these dyes must be assumed as archives and have negligible use for industrial textile processing therefore the investigation of such objects has a more basic nature than practical significance the new field in ntp water wastewater treatment is using catalysts for enhancement the catalytic action of metal cations was reported fe2 cu2 when using jointly to ntp the activity exhibited by metal cation was assigned to fenton like reaction due to decomposition of in situ generated h2o2 132 136 137 promising results were referred to introduction of photocatalysts tio2 138 bipo4 133 into ntp water system then jointly action between ntp and photocatalyst was observed due to photo excitation of a catalyst with plasma generated uv this can be a great source of synergy resulting more efficient plasma uv utilization the next example is titanium dioxide graphene oxide nanomaterials tio2 go was used with ntp bdb type for acetaminophen degradation 139 ceo2 fe2o3 ceo2 and zro2 ceo2 were successfully used as catalysts for phenol ntp degradation 140 at the same time iervolino and coworkers investigated the generation of a greater number of micro discharges followed by enhanced ros production when fe2o3 immobilized glass spheres were introduced into the dbd ntp system 141 these promising synergistic effects caused by catalyst involvement in ntp treatment seem to encourage further investigation in this field since the plasma can be a tool in creating nanostructured catalytic materials 121 then new possibilities open for direct indirect plasma use in wastewater treatment when plasma created catalyst used in ntp treatment system an interesting solution of dbd corona hybrid reactor configuration for non thermal plasma production just right at the place of contact surface with the wastewater was presented by hafeez and co workers 142 however the plasma was used to produce ozone and have no contact with the liquid phase in did therefore the process was the ozonation 2 4 hybrid techniques a novel trend observed in wastewater treatment is the combined use of more than one basic process this tendency can be assumed as a group of treatments of hybrid action one of the first processes proposed in this group is fenton based treatments a combination of fenton reagent electric power and uv light gave the development in wastewater purification fenton based techniques were the first of hybrids and created the testing ground for finding more advanced synergistic effects a further testing ground for hybrids is combinations of techniques that are rarely used as a single process due to their insufficiency or high cost radiation microwaves and ultrasounds are more likely used as supporting components giving satisfactory results noteworthy can be a group of fully hybrid techniques in this group the core technology cannot be distinguished and it is a combination of at least two methods with an equipollent driving force in the overall process in this group electro assisted ozonation joint electrocoagulation and ozonation can be a good example 2 4 1 fenton based hybrids conventional fenton reagent h2o2 fe works mainly due to the in situ generation of ho the reactants in a classical fenton oxidation are ferrous ions fe 2 and hydrogen peroxide and the ho radicals are produced by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide 155 the fe 2 is being reconstituted through the following stages of fenton s reaction and considered to be a catalyst many variations of the fenton process can distinguish fig 3 the first attempts of multiple actions in fenton were initiated by uv introduction 70 156 satisfying results of photo fenton is due to extra hydrogen peroxide decomposition of uv and more efficient fe 2 ions recovery the basis of fenton and photo fenton was included in supplementary materials a2 the next step in fenton development was electric power employment for acceleration following ganzenko and co workers 157 depending on the source of substrates for the process a few types of electro fenton hybridization can be distinguished electro fenton with internal h2o2 generated on the electrode through oxygen reduction reaction orr described in 2 2 and external fe2 electrochemically regenerated fe3 fe2 158 fered fenton with external addition of both reagents and electrochemical recovery of fe2 159 160 peroxi coagulation with in situ internal electro generation of both reagents 161 electrochemical peroxidation with internal fe2 electro generation from sacrificial iron steel and external h2o2 addition 162 the variation of both the abovementioned electro fenton and photo fenton is photoelectro fenton moreover sonoelectro fenton can be found as a curious variety of fenton hybrid the recent trend in fenton s hybrid has been solar fenton as well as solar photoelectro fenton hybrid fig the last mentioned solar photoelectron fenton spef was found especially investigated table 4 following brillas 163 the main driving forces in this process are internal production of h2o2 on the cathode direct oh radical formation on the anode surface through anodic oxidation ao main fenton reaction between internal h2o2 and external fe2 electro recovery of fe3 into fe2 photochemical fe2 recovery by photoreduction of fe oh 2 photodecarboxylation of fe iii carboxylate species these multiple combined actions of spef were referred to be more efficient than other related processes pef ef ao tab when spef is used for real wastewater which contains chlorine and sulfur ions the production of other ros namely peroxodisulfate s2o8 2 ion and chlorine species cl2 hclo clo was referred to be advantageous in the process 163 another possible hybrid is photocatalysis photoelectron fenton name after 163 khataee and co workers used successfully catalysts carbon nanotubes 164 and zno 165 in the photoelectro fenton process for dyes removal the experimental set used by khataee and co workers fig 4 for photocatalysis photoelectron fenton is an excellent example of how the hybrid process can be run with multiple active elements 165 most of fenton examples including the ones mentioned above are classified as homogeneous fenton this means that fe2 ions are fully dissolved in the reaction bulk but heterogeneous fenton can also be found khataee and coworkers used pyrite as a source of iron ions in their sono fenton process 166 then the iron stays in the solid phase on surface of the mineral but following brillas 163 other hetero iron catalysts such as iron oxides deposited on polymer support beads or membranes α feooh znfe2o4 nanoparticles or iron modified electrodes can be distinguished the self imposing conclusion is that very conventional chemical reaction has been firstly exposed by j h fenton in 1889 has given a wide field for exploration conclusively the fenton hybridization can be raised like a recent trend in aops 2 4 2 radiation and acoustics as supportive actions since radiation and acoustics have limited application as self standing techniques in wastewater treatment because of cost or low efficiency they appear as an up and coming supportive source of action besides the visible and uv radiation types which are used in widespread photo based treatments ionizing and non ionizing radiation should be found as a creative field of wastewater purification the oxidation of pollutants in wastewater by ionizing radiation has been explored since the 1960s the ionizing radiation sources are radioactive elements such as 60co and 137cs producing ɣ or x rays 177 and electron beam from the accelerator 178 throughout ionizing radiation pollutants can be assailed in wastewater in two ways direct radiolysis or attack of water radiolysis by products the hydroxyl radical is the essential ros coming from radiative water decomposition therefore the radiation technique includes in aops 178 the most referred supportive action of radiolysis is the positive effect on bod cod ratio increasing textile wastewaters biodegradability consequently radiolysis has been reported as a stage in the sequence before biological treatment 179 180 or post treatment 181 however in fact the synergetic effect was investigated for radiolysis coupled with ozonolysis 182 or chemical oxidants hydrogen peroxide 178 183 184 chlorine potassium persulfate 185 the meaningful examples of the use of these techniques with an explanation of the source of synergy can be found in table 5 and types of radio based were shown in fig 5 a microwaves mw are an example of non ionizing low energy radiation willingly used in wastewater treatment fig 5b however the mw energy is too low to produce ros from water like in radiolysis 186 but mw is used in hybrid techniques for enhancement purposes by causing thermal and non thermal effects the non thermal effect can be exceptionally interesting in aops when mw introduced into water are absorbed by chemical oxidant it can induce the hot spots producing oh radicals the mw energy absorption causes the vibration and rotations on the molecular level when molecular excitation is included the oxidant is keen on breaking through the polar bond producing ros 186 however the thermal effect is also causative because it improves the reactivity of the chemical reaction the hybrid of mw and uv in the presence of chemical oxidants and catalysts was referred to be successful in dyes decomposition 187 subsequently the interaction between mw and catalysts solid body was assumed to surface interaction polarization and π electrons delocalization resulting in catalyst s activation 188 189 consequently the mw is the originator of multiple synergetic actions especially when combined with chemical oxidant radical precursor catalysts or uv 56 recent examples of synergies in mw hybrids for dye decontamination were presented in table 5 the use of ultrasounds can be assumed as the next type of aop nevertheless the chemical effect does not directly from the us wave with the pollutant but rather from the us s impact in developing acoustic cavitation in liquids cavitation is an interesting phenomenon of formation growing and collapsing in an implosive way of gaseous or vapor bubbles in the liquid the implosive collapse creates the hot spots for water dissociation and ros formation 190 non inertial acoustic cavitation by us application finds a wide application in wastewater treatment 190 however the inertial hydrodynamic cavitation caused by sudden pressure drop is also possible it is an adverse effect on mechanics in rotors and pumping units the us is more likely used in hybrid techniques subsection 2 7 than a single treatment low efficiency for single us 177 the most likely in a combination of sonolysis and photocatalysis 191 the synergistic effect of sonolysis and photocatalysis was first investigated as an effect of positive us interaction with catalyst surface resulting in higher catalytic yield 191 over time the extra irradiation from the us sonoluminescence and chemiluminescence was referred to in the us uv hybrid s overall synergistic effect 192 the types of us hybridization in aops were shown in fig 5c 2 4 3 total hybrid the combustion of ozonation and electrochemical treatments creates a group of totally hybrid processes in which both components are equivalent in action no core technique can be distinguished because the ozone electro combination gives a new impact not observed when investigated separately the first progenitor in this group is ozone assisted electrocoagulation o3 and ec combination and the follow up method electrochemical ozonation electro oxidation or electrochemical reduction combined with o3 several studies integrated the ozonation process with ec process to form an electrolysis ozone eco process for the treatment of distillery industrial effluent 199 textile wastewater 101 200 202 mixed industrial wastewater from an industrial park 116 and greywater 99 120 with the use of the iron anode when ozone bubbled into the ec aqueous solution fe eco process redox reactions took place initiating an electro fenton like process 203 204 consequently the eco process exhibited higher organic removal efficiency compared with the ozonation and ecg process 199 it was revealed that the possible reactions in the fe eco process included homogeneous catalytic ozonation peroxone reactions fenton reactions molecular ozone oxidation and coagulation 204 homogeneous catalytic ozonation and fenton reactions were dominant reactions in the fe eco process under initial ph 3 and homogeneous catalytic ozonation and peroxone reactions were pivotal reactions in the fe eco process under initial ph 6 6 204 despite the structural similarities the interactions between electrolytically generated hydrolyzed metal species and ozone were not considered in the previously proposed eco process nevertheless besides al and fe electrodes most of the electrodes in the ec process could be stable electrodes such as electrodes doped by noble metals pt pd rh ru or low cost and durable earth abundant metal oxide fe ti co zn ni 112 118 121 205 208 the organic removal using the stable anodes is mainly through direct electron transfer from organic matter and water oxidation to form oh on the surface of anodes besides most studies applied iron anodes for the treatment of industrial wastewater 101 199 or greywater 99 120 in the eo or e peroxone processes nevertheless the al based electrodes are the most commonly used electrode in water and wastewater treatment 209 210 antimony doped tin oxide lead dioxide pbo2 and boron doped diamond bdd are considered non active anodes and therefore the most suitable for electrochemical combustion reactions 103 105 106 109 bdd electrodes and titanium based metal oxide electrodes are widely used 104 105 120 206 211 212 compared with other conventional anodes bdd has a higher oer and better oxidation performance 105 120 211 but its preparation is complicated and costly especially for that with a large area moreover the bdd surface is chemically inert with high surface resistance so that its applied cell voltage is increased as aforementioned several works have been published in the ec field for the depuration of the organic compound using mainly al and fe electrodes however literature is still scarce in what regards this process using other sacrificial electrodes to depurate complex synthetic mixtures and real wastewaters in the case of the eo different less costly electrodes should be tested to avoid the dependence on the expensive bdd electrodes the study of other reactor configurations able to improve efficiency while reducing energy consumption is still a field for research in both electrochemical processes 3 examples of dye decomposition by products besides pharmaceuticals preserves pesticides textile dyes are one of the most investigated groups of pollutants numerous research papers on a vast number of dyes can find literature there is no wonder if there are over 100 000 types of commercial dyes and over 800 000 tons of dye related goods are produced annually 81 for a deeper understanding it must be mentioned that dyes soluble in water include the group of colorants the same as pigments insoluble in water 213 from a chemical point of view commercial dyes are mostly synthetic compounds of the organic basin there are two fundamental classifications of colorants to follow first created to chemical structure and second related to applicability the first classification core is associated with the chemical structure of dye chromophore therefore several chemical groups can be distinguished from the simplest polyenes then azo including metal complex carbonyl indigo type anthraquinone and others the classification related to fiber applicability is more transparent more commonly used and has a practical meaning consequently the following groups were distinguished disperse for polyester acid for polyamide wool silk direct and reactive for cotton and viscose cationic for acrylic and others such as sulfur vat mordant 213 as far as this classification is meaningful it was the basis of the color index catalog this strictly defined register established jointly by the society of dyers and colourists uk and the american association of textile chemists and colorists usa allows for smoothly navigating the issue of colorants afterward all registered colorants have their systematic name following the c i generic name template the authors aimed to put more light on the issue of the need for more enhanced dye removal from the environment this paper stresses out the possibility of the toxic by products appearance as a consequence of insufficient purification keeping in mind the vast number of textile dyes it has to follow some chosen examples the methylene blue and reactive black 5 were selected as representatives 3 1 methylene blue methylene blue c i basic blue 9 is one of the thiazine dyes the oxidation of dimethyl 4 phenylenediamine drives a simple synthesis supported by sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 leading to mb production mb was used in the textile industry until the 1880s for silk dyeing the use of mb in textiles has been discontinued because of low light fastness 213 nowadays mb is mainly used in analytical applications e g microscope sample staining together with other very basic dyes such as congo red methyl orange cristal violet rhodamine b create a group of archaic colorants without a practical meaning in the textile industry even though the vast number of research papers deal with the aforementioned dyes purification these investigations give more basic than practical knowledge consequently these dyes cannot be found in industrial textile wastewater table 6 presents by products detected during mb degradation the leucomethylene blue sulfoxide m z 301 amu and the leucomethylene blue sulfone m z 317 amu were referred as the by product characteristic for the first stage of oxidative degradation originated in oh radical 215 216 following by products specified for oxidative action of oh radical were by m z 303 230 218 165 158 157 amu 215 217 a very interesting mb degradation path way was proposed by bansode and co workes 126 based on ftir analysis and lcms pattern ten by products m z 270 256 242 228 amu and other less specific were detected in this study these data were collected for 15 min of ntp treatment as far as plasma was a driving force in this treatment the multiple actions of o3 o o 2 ros ron occurred in this study based on optical emission of plasma spectrum the plasma driven by products differ from those generated by oh radical moreover the positive effect on toxicity was proven for plasma treated mb by no inhibition of growth of e coli 126 preliminary it can be concluded that depending on oxidizing agent specific by products occurred at the same time the characteristic by products the evidential through which mother pollutant could be recognized these occur in the first stage of treatment 8 10 min then non evidential by products could be found more often simple compounds such as phenol 126 214 217 moreover non evidential by products are not related to the treatment type 3 2 reactive black 5 the second example for the discussion reactive black 5 rb5 was chosen as an antitype for mb in contrast to mb rb5 is a dye of great practical meaning in the textile industry rb5 is the most popular textile dye with the highest tonnage production in the world this dye is the basic component of most industrial black dyeing products e g remazol ultra black nn remazol midnight black rgb remazol onyx rgb dystar cibacron navy dp b cibacron navy w b ciba specialty chemicals inc levafix black e b bayer group sumifix black b150 sumitomo chemical co ltd and far more more than one hundred black textile dyes are originated on the base of rb5 rb5 in a dis azo reactive dye the chromophore consists of two twin azo groups linked to aromatic sp2 hybridized atoms of carbon this colored core is equipped in two groups vinyl sulfone precursor so2ch2ch2oso3h able to the covalent bond formation with the cellulosic substrate 213 the parent compounds for rb5 synthesis are 4 2 sulfatoethyl sulfonyl aniline sodium salt p ester and 4 amino 5 hydroxynaphthalene 2 7 disulphonic acid sodium salt h acid consequently rb5 is typical representative of azo dyes based on letter acid as far as the products for the rb5 synthesis are concerned their reflections are the by products of decomposition therefore the h acid derivatives and aniline derivatives were observed as by products table 7 the characteristic of rb5 is the hydrolysis of vinyl sulphonyl reactive groups taking place during the dyeing process this adverse feature makes the low fixation level of rb5 dye followed by a high content of wasted dye in wastewater up to 40 therefore the hydrolyzed rb5 form should be expected in industrial wastewater 221 further oxidizing of rb5 in wastewater brings oxidation of azo chromophore notably the use of ozone resulted in azo bond destruction the selectivity of molecular ozone explained this in oxidation and its affinity to attract the moiety of high molecular density 23 26 222 but when hydroxyl radical is the primary oxidant in the system which is highly non selective the by products related to azo bond braking occur 218 220 the following colorless by products are derivatives of h acid and para ester 4 202 218 220 therefore it would be tough to conclude if a specific degradation pathway depends on the treatment type the presented scheme could also be observed for other similarly build azo dyes such as direct red 81 dr81 169 or reactive blue 171 223 and other azo dyes 224 the problematic issue is the low molecular weight by products such as phenol naphthol aromatic amines they were shown as resistant to ozone and ozone based aops and what is more they were proved to be able to accumulation during multiple recycling 200 however a few preliminary studies are devoted to enhanced by product removal bilińska et al 2020c 2020a lucyna bilińska et al 2019a a wide gap needs to be fulfilled in the area of enhanced by product removal the most vivid argument is low toc removal during aops while color was removed entirely 225 rb5 is one of the few dyes with the quantified value of toxicity the ec50 value was determined for this dye between 3 86 0 32 mg l 55 and 4 9 1 45 mg l 226 in the form of sodium salt at the same time it was investigated that ozone based aops o3 h2o2 o3 uv o3 and uv o3 h2o2 decreased the toxicity of rb5 in water solution and in textile wastewater 55 the promising results were also referred for catalytic ozonation 202 4 conclusions this review presents the recent trends in aops the main aim of this work was to stress out the areas for further research catalytic ozonation electrochemical oxidation and plasma were shown as the most promising core aops but then what should be considered as the broadest testing ground for further investigation is the hybrids the synergies between a few active factors were shown to be beneficial the supportive action of catalysts uv mw or us jointed with traditional techniques fenton ozonation or electrocoagulation was referred to as more effective higher efficiency in color cod toc removal was the advantage of catalytic processes and hybrids at the same time the decrease in toxicity and specific degradation pathway of treated dyes indicated the benefits of novel aops the field for development is the creation of new materials modern structural materials expanded in the nanoscale give new opportunities to create new catalysts or new electrodes it was shown not only oxygen based reactive species ros are meaningful in modern aops the traditional aops have already been redefined the generation of nitrogen sulfur chlorine reactive species has become more frequently the target of aops the most significant gap that needs to be covered seems to be plasma treatment plasma has not been often used so far in textile wastewater treatment while plasma itself allows massive production of various reactive species it can be further improved by introducing a catalyst the authors believe that novel plasma catalytic hybrid aops allow more efficient textile wastewater treatment and reuse credit
