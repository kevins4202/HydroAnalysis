7010,studying the spatial and temporal variations of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values δd and δ18o respectively in precipitation and groundwater in catchments with different land cover is of great significance to understanding the hydrologic cycles within the catchments this study is focused on three karst catchments banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe in guizhou province southwest china a region with a subtropical humid monsoon climate we analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in the δd and δ18o of precipitation and groundwater in these areas from september 2007 to september 2009 local meteoric water lines lmwls for the study areas and their relationships with groundwater were established the seasonal variations of δd and δ18o for both precipitation and groundwater were similar being depleted in the heavier isotopomer in the rainy season and enriched in the heavier isotopomer in the dry season the similarity of patterns between groundwater and precipitation indicates short groundwater residence times in the three catchments typical of karst terrains the isotopic values of the banzhai catchment which is covered by a thin soil layer beneath virgin forest floor had the largest variation among the three catchments the isotopic compositions of the banzhai catchment groundwater were close to those of precipitation in the rainy season and responded rapidly to it indicating that precipitation quickly recharges groundwater in this area in comparison in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments the thicker soil layers and large numbers of paddy fields and dry lands in the catchments resulted in more intense evaporation and therefore relatively higher isotopic values in the infiltration water consequently the isotopic values of spring water in these two areas were higher and varied to a lesser extent in the rainy season than those of precipitation the rayleigh fractionation model based on the correlation between the deuterium excess d and evaporation was employed in this study the model calculation results showed that the catchment evaporation was more intense in dengzhanhe than in chenqi with 14 1 and 6 4 of the water evaporated in dengzhanhe and chenqi respectively the higher percentage of evaporation in dengzhanhe was mainly due to the larger percentage of paddy fields in the catchment in contrast the effects of evaporation from free water surfaces or soil surfaces on groundwater in the virgin forest covered banzhai catchment were extremely weak based on the isotopic and high resolution continuous meteorological and discharge data the transpiration rates were estimated to be 78 for banzhai 10 4 for chenqi and 24 1 for dengzhanhe and the differences among these values are mainly attributed to differences in vegetation types in those areas these results show that the variation in stable isotopes in groundwater can be used as a key index in evaluating the effects of different land cover changes and environmental changes on the water cycle in a catchment keywords hydrogen and oxygen isotopes local meteoric water line groundwater karst catchment water cycle land cover 1 introduction the southwest china karst region is one of the largest karst areas among the major concentrated karst regions in the world a relatively large number of environmental issues have stemmed from the karst water cycle change caused by soil erosion rocky desertification and vegetation degeneration these latter environmental problems are closely related to human activities and different land uses land use plays an important role in catchment s water cycle for example different land uses can affect the hydrological process of a catchment and can affect the catchment water balance through influencing evapotranspiration bronstert et al 2002 raymond et al 2008 due to special hydrogeological conditions in karst areas e g less soil development strong karst leakage and etc ford and williams 2007 the factors that affect the catchment water cycle are varied and complex which makes the processes of precipitation and runoff in karst catchments very complicated therefore studying the water cycle pattern in karst regions under different land uses is of great significance to addressing regional environmental issues related to water cycle marfia et al 2004 in a catchment atmospheric precipitation passes through the unsaturated zone and recharges groundwater soil vegetation and lithology can all affect this recharge process clark and fritz 1997 jasechko et al 2013 studying the response of groundwater to atmospheric precipitation can provide guidance for understanding the mechanism of the complex recharge processes in a catchment since craig 1961 and dansgaard 1964 advanced the basic theory of water isotopes in the water cycle δd and δ18o have played important roles in studies of the water cycle δd and δ18o are extensively used in different scales of hydrological processes studies commonly individual rainstorm seasonal and annual scales identifying the seasonal variations of δd and δ18o in precipitation and groundwater can facilitate the evaluation of the mean groundwater residence time lindstrom and rodhe 1986 ramspacher et al 1992 research in non karst regions has shown relatively small seasonal variations of δd and δ18o in groundwater which markedly diminished and lagged the seasonal variations in precipitation indicating the groundwater residence time of generally more than one year dewalle et al 1997 δd and δ18o has also been used to examine rainstorm dynamics in catchments and then reflect the aquifer parameters under rainstorm conditions lyon et al 2009 in this study we will show that stable isotope responses in a karst terrain on multiple scales differ greatly from those in non karst terrains quantifying water cycle processes e g runoff evaporation and transpiration in a catchment is often difficult because evapotranspiration consists of both physical evaporation from surfaces and biological transpiration telmer and veizer 2000 globally research on the quantification of evapotranspiration has been mostly focused on arid and semiarid regions in china similar research is mainly concentrated on the north region whereas very few studies have examined southern regions where the climate is warm and humid and the vegetation is dense schlesinger and jasechko 2014 there are three main approaches used to study evapotranspiration field measurement models and isotopic methods sutanto et al 2014 field measurement methods are mainly based on physical parameters related to evaporation process such as humidity wind speed and solar radiation the eddy covariance ec method is the most commonly used field measurement method while the ec method is relatively accurate for fixed points it may be problematic when applied to a larger scale e g catchment scale telmer and veizer 2000 in addition some physical parameters involved in the ec method are relatively difficult and costly to acquire modeling is an extension of field measurement methods but requires validation and correction against measured data in practical applications the introduction of isotopic methods has significantly advanced quantitative research on water cycles in catchments without high accuracy meteorological instrument measurements telmer and veizer 2000 the conventional method for determining evaporation in a catchment is based on difference of δd and δ18o between groundwater and meteoric precipitation first the initial isotopic composition of groundwater in the catchment is determined the initial composition is usually taken as the values at the intersection point of the evaporation and meteoric water lines of the catchment kendall and caldwell 1998 the amount of evaporation can then be calculated gonfiantini 1986 telmer and veizer 2000 lee and veizer 2003 however the δd and δ18o in large catchments may have relatively large variation a more powerful derivative stable isotope parameter deuterium excess d is unrelated to the isotopic composition of precipitation but instead is related to its sources and subsequent processes for this reason waters with different δd and δ18o may exhibit the same d value clark and fritz 1997 huang and pang 2012 moreover the d in a catchment reflects degree of evaporation the more intense evaporation is the lower d value is dansgaard 1964 while the d value and δd and δ18o values are all related to evaporation the d value is more stable and conducive to the investigation of evaporation in a catchment than the δd and δ18o values the three catchments of banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe in guizhou southwest china each under different land uses were selected as the study areas in this project precipitation and groundwater samples were collected during two consecutive hydrological years september 2007 through september 2009 this study reveals the δd and δ18o variation patterns of karst groundwater under these different land uses and demonstrates the dynamics of water cycle processes in karst catchments 2 general information about the study areas banzhai catchment situated in the maolan national karst forest nature reserve in libo county guizhou the banzhai catchment 107 55 108 05 e 25 12 25 15 n fig 1 is part of the liujiang river system in the pearl river basin and encompasses an area of approximately 19 km2 fig 2 this catchment has a multi year 30 years annual mean temperature of 18 3 c a multi year 30 years annual mean precipitation of about 1750 mm which mainly occurs in may through october and a multi year 30 years annual mean relative humidity of 80 zhou 1987 bedrock comprises middle carboniferous dolomitic limestone c2 and lower carboniferous c1d 3 marl and shale zeng et al 2016 the soil in this area is mainly black limestone soil 0 2 m thick with a discontinuous distribution covering less than 10 of the whole catchment area it is primarily found in karst valley bottoms and is used as farmland fig 2 the soil is thin and discontinuous and surface water is absent zhou 1987 in the catchment the elevation is higher in the west and lower in the east and the landscape is a typical peak cluster karst the main groundwater aquifer is the dolomitic limestone of c2 that is 586 m thick while the underlying c1d 3 aquitard is marl and shale that is 175 m thick the aquitard is only sporadically exposed near the banzhai station the sampling site in fig 2 the carbonates that constitute aquifers are not folded but have a tabular disposition they were affected by faults which led to the development of karst fissures and conduits zeng 2009 many sink holes occur along the karst valleys these provide infiltration pathways to the aquifer essentially when precipitation falls on the banzhai catchment it infiltrates and passes through the fissures and channels of c2 and finally discharges at the mouth of banzhai catchment banzhai station the banzhai catchment has not been significantly affected by human activities therefore primary karst forest is the main land cover the entire catchment has a high forest coverage percentage greater than90 zhou 1987 zeng 2009 however most of the trees grow directly on carbonate rocks with little or no soil chenqi and dengzhanhe karst spring catchments located within the well known houzhai karst stream catchment 105 42 105 43 e 26 14 26 15 n in puding county guizhou the interconnected chenqi and dengzhanhe karst spring catchments fig 3 are parts of the wujiang river system in the yangtze river basin fig 1 the houzhai catchment has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with wet weather and abundant precipitation in warm summers this area has a multi year 30 years annual mean temperature of 15 1 c a multi year 30 years annual mean precipitation of 1315 mm and a multi year 30 years annual mean relative humidity of 78 zhao et al 2010 in addition precipitation mainly occurs in the rainy season may to october which coincides with high temperatures rainy season precipitation accounts for more than 80 of the annual total wan et al 1998 chen et al 2005 the chenqi and dengzhanhe spring catchments encompass areas of 1 31 and 2 82 km2 respectively fig 3 the lithology is the middle triassic guanling formation t2g which is mainly composed of limestone and dolomite intercalated with marl and shale zhao et al 2010 the carbonates that constitute aquifers are not folded but have a tabular disposition they were affected by faults which led to the development of karst fissures and conduits yang et al 2001 the geomorphology of both catchments is categorized as karst peak cluster valley the quaternary q limestone soil with relatively low permeability is mainly distributed in the karst valley bottoms and has been cultivated as paddy fields and dryland non irrigated cropland fig 4 the aquifers in the two catchments are the q limestone soil varying from 0 m to 15 m thick and the limestone and dolomite of t2g2 t2g3 with a thickness of 897 m fig 3 the 200 m thick underlying aquitard composed of the marl and shale of t2g1 is not exposed in the studied catchments elevations of chenqi and dengzhanhe spring catchments are higher in the northeast and lower in the southwest the lowest elevation being 1310 m the highest elevation in chenqi spring catchment it is 1524 m while in the dengzhanhe spring catchment is 1559 m zhao et al 2010 the elevations of the chenqi spring and the dengzhanhe spring are the lowest points in their own drainage areas there are sink holes and estavelles along the karst valley from the northeast to the southwest of both catchments making the karst valley the main runoff zone the chenqi and dengzhanhe springs are the final outlets in their respective karst systems the chenqi and dengzhanhe spring catchments are significantly affected by human activities with the main land use types in these catchments table 1 fig 4 include paddy fields dryland and shrubland the paddy fields 14 in the chenqi catchment are mainly distributed in the runoff area in contrast the paddy fields 19 in the dengzhanhe spring catchment are mainly distributed in its both recharge and runoff areas no matter where the paddy fields of catchments are located whether they are in the upper recharge area or lower runoff area they are in valley bottoms or the lower reaches of epikarst springs which provide good foundation for cultivation therefore the paddy fields of both catchments are mainly recharged by their upstream epikarst springs and precipitation and will recharge the groundwater beneath them and finally discharge to the catchment outlets chenqi and dengzhanhe springs respectively figs 3 and 4 however the dryland area in the chenqi spring catchment accounts for a significantly higher proportion of the total catchment area 56 than that in the dengzhanhe spring catchment 44 in both spring catchments vegetation has been severely damaged by felling and mostly degraded to shrubland severe rocky desertification of these karst areas is apparent the shrubland area accounts for 30 and 37 of the total catchment area in chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments respectively 3 research methods 3 1 sampling and analysis from september 2007 to september 2009 the groundwater in the three catchment stations was sampled once a month precipitation samples were removed from collectors immediately after each precipitation event ended some precipitation samples were discarded if samples could not be collected immediately when the rain stopped all of the samples were sealed with parafilm and stored at approximately 4 c high resolution continuous discharge and meteorological data were obtained using automatic data loggers with a multi parameter water quality meter model ctdp300 zeng et al 2016 all samples were analyzed at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry the institute of geochemistry of the chinese academy of sciences δ18o values of rainwater and groundwater samples were measured using gv isoprime continuous flow mass spectrometer cf irms the δd values of all samples were measured using the cf irms after the water sample equilibrated in a vial with h2 gas using platinum wire as the catalyst sun and liu 2010 we used national standard gbw04401 gbw04402 gbw04403 gbw04404 as our in house reference materials and their reference values are δdvsmow 0 4 δ18ovsmow 0 32 δdvsmow 64 8 δ18ovsmow 8 79 δdvsmow 189 1 δ18ovsmow 24 52 and δdvsmow 428 3 δ18ovsmow 55 16 respectively jin et al 1991 the measurements were represented by the δd and δ18o values relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and the systematic analytical errors for the δd and δ18o values were less than 2 and 0 2 respectively the standard deviation of δd and δ18o measurement is 1σ 3 2 evapotranspiration calculation using the water balance method the evapotranspiration of a catchment can be estimated through the water balance method proposed by wisler and brater 1959 which is shown in eq 1 1 et p r δ s where et is evapotranspiration p is precipitation r is runoff and s is the change in groundwater storage in this study s is close to zero because the time for calculation is two hydrological years then the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation evapotranspiration rate can be estimated by eq 2 2 et p r p 3 3 evaporation estimation using the d excess method craig 1961 discovered a specific linear relationship between δ18o and δd of global precipitation i e the global meteoric water line gmwl 3 δ d 8 δ 18 o 10 4 δ d v smow r s r st 1 1000 5 δ 18 o v smow r s r st 1 1000 where rs and rst are the d h ratio of the sample and the standard respectively in eq 4 and the 18o 16o ratio of the sample and the standard respectively in eq 5 dansgaard 1964 defined a new parameter deuterium excess 6 d δ d 8 δ 18 o it can be deduced from the gmwl that the mean d value of global precipitation is 10 which is mainly controlled by such factors as the humidity and temperature in the water vapor source area as well as evaporation friedman et al 1992 smith et al 1992 because the evaporation component undergoes evolution as described by the rayleigh process clark and fritz 1997 it is assumed that the evaporation of groundwater follows rayleigh fractionation i e 7 r s r 0 s f α 1 based on eqs 4 and 5 we use δ instead of r for convenience and thus the rayleigh fractionation is expressed by δ as is shown in eq 8 8 δ δ 0 1000 f α 1 1000 then based on eqs 6 and 8 we have 9 d δ d 0 1000 f α d 1 1000 8 δ 18 o 0 1000 f α 18 o 1 1000 δ d 0 1000 f α d 1 8 δ 18 o 0 1000 f α 18 o 1 7000 in the above equation f is the residual fraction of groundwater and α is the fractionation factor that includes both the equilibrium and the kinetic fractionation factors α 1 α ε α is an equilibrium fractionation factor related only to temperature eqs 10 and 11 and ε is a dynamic enrichment factor which is related to humidity h eqs 12 and 13 gonfiantini 1986 clark and fritz 1997 majoube 1971 δ18o0 and δd0 are the initial isotopic compositions of groundwater and d is the d excess of groundwater which is calculated from the isotopic compositions of groundwater 10 1000 ln α d 24 844 10 6 t 2 76 248 10 3 t 52 612 11 1000 ln α 18 o 1 137 10 6 t 2 0 4156 10 3 t 2 0667 12 δ ε d 12 5 1 h 1000 13 δ ε 18 o 14 2 1 h 1000 therefore based on climatic characteristics multi year average temperature and humidity zhou 1987 and the initial and current isotopic compositions of groundwater in each selected catchment the percentage of groundwater that evaporates e 1 f can be calculated using eq 9 for error analysis because the quantification is performed on the scale of two full hydrological years and the meteorological parameters temperature and humidity are multi year mean values zhou 1987 the error in the percentage of evaporated groundwater calculated using eq 9 is mainly attributed to the initial isotopic composition of groundwater the δd0 and δ18o0 values d δ d 0 1000 f α d 1 8 δ 18 o 0 1000 f α 18 o 1 7000 let a δd0 and b δ18o0 based on the error propagation equations the root mean square error rmse for the percentage of groundwater that evaporates is 14 s f f a 2 s a 2 f b 2 s b 2 15 f a f α d 1 a 1000 α d 1 f α d 2 8 b 1000 α 18 o 1 f α 18 o 2 16 f b 8 f α 18 o 2 a 1000 α d 1 f α d 2 8 b 1000 α 18 o 1 f α 18 o 2 where sa and sb are the rmses for δd0 and δ18o0 respectively therefore transpiration can be estimated by combining the evaporation through the d excess method eq 9 with evapotranspiration obtained through the water balance method eq 2 which is given in eq 17 in this paper transpiration is taken as the water loss to the atmosphere through plants including interception by plants 17 t et e 4 results and interpretation the statistical analysis shows that the δ18o values of precipitation in banzhai range from 13 66 to 1 12 with a mean value of 5 96 3 78 n 53 the δ18o values of precipitation in chenqi range from 14 47 to 3 36 with a mean value of 6 85 4 19 n 42 and the δ18o values of precipitation in dengzhanhe range from 18 39 to 1 52 with a mean value of 8 26 4 40 n 49 furthermore the δ18o values of groundwater in banzhai range from 9 71 to 5 36 with a mean value of 7 89 1 37 n 19 the δ18o values of groundwater in chenqi range from 9 31 to 6 55 with a mean value of 8 22 0 76 n 20 and the δ18o values of groundwater in dengzhanhe range from 10 18 to 6 30 with a mean value of 8 26 0 96 n 19 4 1 local meteoric water lines lmwls based on the δ18o and δd data of precipitation collected from september 2007 to september 2009 local meteoric water lines lmwls were established for the study areas due to low precipitation during the dry season and improper preservation of the samples only a relatively small number of dry season samples were collected from chenqi and dengzhanhe to better facilitate the analysis data collected from the study points in the houzhai subterranean stream catchment during the dry season are used as supplementary data for chenqi and dengzhanhe the lmwls for the study areas are as follows chenqi δd 8 77δ18o 18 59 dengzhanhe δd 8 56δ18o 18 47 and banzhai δd 7 44δ18o 4 20 fig 5 the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls for chenqi and dengzhanhe are higher than those of the gmwl proposed by craig 1961 δd 8δ18o 10 yurtsever 1975 δd 8 17δ18o 10 56 and hoefs 2009 δd 7 96 0 02 δ18o 8 86 0 17 and the meteoric water line for china proposed by zheng et al 1983 δd 7 9δ18o 8 2 in comparison the slope and intercept of the banzhai lmwl are lower than those of the meteoric water lines proposed by craig 1961 yurtsever 1975 and zheng et al 1983 these differences may occur because the aforementioned gmwls and meteoric water line for china were produced based on observational data acquired at various locations across the globe and across china respectively and are relatively homogenized results based on precipitation data from both dry and wet regions in this study data from each precipitation event is used unlike the monthly mean precipitation data used to create the global network of isotopes in precipitation the stable isotopic data for precipitation derived from precipitation events are more prone to the local effects of evaporation temperature and sampling time therefore the different slopes and intercepts of the lmwls established in this study reflect local climatic conditions in each of the catchments compared to the lmwls for chenqi and dengzhanhe the lmwl for the banzhai catchment has a lower slope and higher δd and δ18o values which can be attributed to the climatic characteristics of the catchment the banzhai catchment has a mid subtropical humid monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 18 3 c in contrast the chenqi and dengzhanhe karst spring catchments have a subtropical humid climate with an annual mean temperature of 15 1 c therefore the more intense below cloud evaporation of precipitation in banzhai results in a lower lmwl slope which is in fact an evaporation line and relatively higher δd and δ18o values in precipitation corroborated by the lower d value shown in section 4 3 the relationships between δd and δ18o of groundwater and the corresponding lmwl in each study area are shown in fig 6 for the distribution of δd and δ18o of groundwater collected during the rainy season may to october and dry season november to april of the following year the isotopic values of all groundwater samples fall near their respective lmwls indicating that groundwater in the study areas originates entirely from precipitation regardless of the season most δd and δ18o values of groundwater in the banzhai catchment fall above the lmwl and consequently the lmwl represents the evaporation line of groundwater fig 6 hence as previously noted most of the precipitation evaporated as it fell in banzhai however the groundwater in the banzhai catchment is mainly recharged by heavy precipitation events which are accompanied by weak below cloud evaporation moreover banzhai is an area with primary forest coverage of greater than 90 and evaporation from the soil surface is relatively weak thereby limiting evaporation from the catchment therefore slope of groundwater is higher than that of precipitation in banzhai because of recharged precipitation with weak below cloud evaporation and weak evaporation from the catchment most δd and δ18o values of groundwater in chenqi and dengzhanhe plot below their respective lmwls suggesting evaporation of groundwater which mainly results from the significant effects of land cover in chenqi and dengzhanhe fig 6 in these two areas paddy fields and dryland are the main land use types resulting in more intense evaporation from water and soil surfaces therefore in the catchments the isotopic compositions of groundwater not only responded to precipitation but also were influenced by land cover conditions 4 2 characteristics of seasonal variations in δd and δ18o values dansgaard 1964 derived the main factors that affect stable isotope values in precipitation from north pole observation data as the water vapor source conditions the thermal effect the precipitation effect the continental effect the altitude effect and the latitude effect etc the δd and δ18o values of precipitation are not only related to the local climate precipitation temperature etc but also closely linked to the water vapor transport process zheng et al 2009 wei and lin 1994 as shown in fig 7 the δd and δ18o values of precipitation and groundwater vary over time in the banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments the δd and δ18o values of precipitation exhibit notable seasonal variations these values are low in the rainy summer season and high in the dry winter season fig 7 this pattern occurs mainly because the research areas have a monsoon climate and water vapor in the summer originates mostly from low latitude oceanic areas this water vapor source has a relatively high humidity and easily forms strong convective weather events generating large volumes of precipitation which leads to the precipitation effect and produces isotopic depletions in summer araguas araguas et al 1998 during the winter cold and dry continental air masses are the main water vapor source for precipitation in guizhou the main water vapor sources in winter are moisture transported by the westerlies and inland recycled water vapor these systems have low humidity and produce relatively little precipitation as a result the δd and δ18o values of precipitation are higher in winter the δd and δ18o values of groundwater also exhibit notable seasonal variations in banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe the δd and δ18o values of groundwater are low in the rainy season and high in the dry season fig 7 seasonal variations in the isotopic values of groundwater are consistent with those of precipitation therefore the groundwater residence time is relatively short less than one year and runoff is discharged rapidly because the variation coefficients of δd and δ18o in banzhai are greater than those in chenqi and dengzhanhe table 2 the δd and δ18o values in banzhai vary more than those in chenqi and dengzhanhe in the rainy season the δd and δ18o values of banzhai groundwater is the closest to that of precipitation the three study areas are karst catchments with predominant fissure and conduit flows but the banzhai catchment 19 km2 is approximately 10 times larger than the chenqi 1 31 km2 and dengzhanhe 2 82 km2 catchments precipitation in the former catchment is intercepted by plants to a significantly larger extent than in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments because of the dense primary forests that grow in banzhai on the other hand the soil cover in the banzhai catchment is much thinner than in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments during rainfall events precipitation with low δd and δ18o values rapidly recharges the groundwater system in banzhai through exposed fissures and conduits and the buffering effect of soil is relatively weak because of the thin and discontinuous soil in combination these characteristics result in rapid recharge and discharge of water stored in the karst catchment as a result the δd and δ18o of groundwater in banzhai is close to that of precipitation like banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe karst catchments are also dominated by fissure and conduit flows but their δd and δ18o values of groundwater are notably higher than those of precipitation in the rainy season the difference in stable isotopes between groundwater and precipitation in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments is mainly attributed to thicker soil layers and different land uses the land use there is mainly dryland and shrubland where intense evaporation results from large expanses of exposed soil as a result when precipitation recharges groundwater it mixes with soil water that is affected by evaporation the buffering effect of soil and the groundwater has thus a heavier isotopic composition differing from that of precipitation in addition a large number of paddy fields are also distributed in both the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments and evaporation from the water surface results in heavier isotope values in the residual water because the perched water tables of the paddy fields are higher than the groundwater the heavier isotopic water in the paddy fields recharges the groundwater below and shifting isotopes to higher values in the dry season due to decreased precipitation the amount of water that infiltrates the soil and recharges groundwater is much less than in the wet season therefore precipitation plays a more significant role in replenishing the soil moisture that has been evaporated clark and fritz 1997 so that the isotopic composition of groundwater in the dry season differs from the isotopic composition of dry season precipitation 4 3 characteristics of the variations in the d value in the study areas in banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe the d values exhibit notable seasonal variations in precipitation fig 8 overall the d values are low in the rainy season and high in the dry season in banzhai the d value of precipitation ranges from 12 04 to 27 00 with a mean value of 7 57 6 42 n 43 the d value of precipitation varies from 0 96 to 23 68 with a mean value of 12 92 6 64 n 26 in chenqi and ranges from 1 07 to 23 87 with a mean value of 13 04 5 38 n 40 in dengzhanhe these trends are similar to that in chongqing li et al 2010 but are opposite to the trend of seasonal variations in the d value of precipitation in urumqi li and zhou 2007 suggesting different geographic locations and water vapor sources for precipitation fig 1 guizhou is located in a monsoon climate zone where the water vapor sources for precipitation in the dry season winter mainly consist of cold and dry air masses that are transported by the westerlies and inland re evaporated water vapor associated with continental air masses as a result overall precipitation in the dry season has high δd and δ18o values and a high d value in contrast the summer monsoon is intense in the rainy season during which water vapor mainly originates from high humidity warm and wet air masses with low d values from low latitude oceanic areas therefore the seasonal variations in the d value of precipitation in banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe are mainly caused by the difference between the water vapor sources in the rainy and dry seasons the mean d values of precipitation in chenqi and dengzhanhe are 10 higher than the value of the gmwl whereas the mean d values in banzhai are significantly lower than the value of the gmwl research has shown that precipitation that forms from recycled water vapor generated by evaporation from free water surfaces or soil surfaces has a high d value zhang 2008 while evaporation will cause the d value to be lower therefore it is likely that the relatively low d value of precipitation in banzhai is the result of below cloud evaporation of precipitation the d value of groundwater shows weak seasonal variations fig 8 in banzhai the d value ranges from 5 58 to 19 07 with a mean value of 10 85 3 11 n 19 the d value of chenqi ranges from 6 08 to 17 40 with a mean value of 9 94 2 76 n 20 the d value of dengzhanhe ranges from 0 36 to 16 96 with a mean value of 9 55 4 12 n 19 the relationship between δ18o and d of groundwater in the rainy and dry seasons in the study areas is shown in fig 9 there is a strong negative correlation between δ18o and d in the three catchments during the dry season whereas the correlation is weaker in the rainy season this may result from infiltration of large amounts of precipitation in the rainy season that mask the effects of evaporation on groundwater while evaporation effects are evident in the dry season when the amount of precipitation that infiltrates and recharges groundwater is limited although the groundwater in banzhai experienced evaporation during the dry season the effect of evaporation on the groundwater in banzhai on a full year scale is extremely weak as shown in fig 6 the negative correlation between δ18o and d reflects the influence of evaporation on groundwater therefore the isotopic composition of groundwater in chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments is closely linked to evaporation 4 4 partitioning evapotranspiration rates in the study catchments as noted above in the banzhai catchment almost all groundwater samples plot above the lmwl of banzhai which indicates that the groundwater has not experienced significant evaporation the groundwater in both the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments is affected by evaporation because most groundwater samples plot below their lmwl and are distributed along their evaporation lines fig 10 thus we discuss the effects of evaporation on groundwater only in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments the offset of isotopic composition represented by the length of the evaporation line between groundwater and its initial water the intersection of lmwl and evaporation line represents the degree of evaporation the larger the offset the higher the degree of evaporation clark and fritz 1997 huang and pang 2012 therefore the greatest groundwater evaporation in both the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments occurs in the rainy season reflecting the characteristics of the rainy season high temperatures and intense evaporation to analyze the differences between chenqi and dengzhanhe on multi year scale a two year mean of δd and δ18o of groundwater in the two catchments are used the length s2 between the two year mean of groundwater and the initial water in dengzhanhe is clearly longer than the length s1 in chenqi fig 10 therefore the degree of evaporation is stronger in dengzhanhe than in chenqi to quantify the evaporation rate in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments with different land cover patterns the evaporation of groundwater is assumed to follow rayleigh fractionation model puding has a multi year annual mean temperature of 15 1 c and a multi year annual mean humidity of 78 by using the initial and current isotopic compositions of groundwater and eq 9 the evaporation rates are calculated to be 6 in chenqi and 14 in dengzhanhe table 3 based on the error propagation eqs 14 15 and 16 the absolute errors of groundwater that evaporates are 4 and 1 for the chenqi and dengzhanhe spring catchments respectively the results obtained from calculations based on the rayleigh fractionation model are consistent with the qualitative analysis results shown in fig 10 indicating that the degree of evaporation in dengzhanhe is stronger than that in chenqi this is mainly because paddy fields account for a higher proportion of land use in dengzhanhe and evaporation from free water surfaces in the paddy fields can result in high δd and δ18o and low d values which in turn affects groundwater in the catchment through infiltration based on the high resolution continuous meteorological and discharge data collected during the studied period the evapotranspiration rates et can be calculated using eqs 1 and 2 combined with the evaporation rates e derived from the d method the transpiration rates t can be estimated as well the t is 78 for banzhai 10 4 for chenqi and 24 1 for dengzhanhe table 4 the differences among these values are mainly attributable to differences in vegetation types the strongest transpiration rates in the banzhai catchment result from the presence of primary forest with dense vegetation the transpiration rates in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments are both lower than those in the banzhai catchment because their vegetation types are mainly sparse shrubland additionally the slightly higher transpiration rates in dengzhanhe than chenqi is due to the higher percentage of shrub cover in this catchment table 1 therefore the land cover does significantly impact the catchment water cycle 4 5 comparing the t et with studies elsewhere in the world the ratio of t to et expressed as a percentage of the three catchments are 62 5 in chenqi 63 2 in dengzhanhe and 100 in banzhai table 4 these values indicate that the water cycle through evapotranspiration in karst catchments is also dominantly controlled by transpiration the global mean being 61 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 it is noteworthy that the t et values in chenqi and dengzhanhe subtropical shrublands are equal or higher than those of mediterranean shrubland 39 60 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 and semiarid shrubland 42 47 according to cavanaugh et al 2011 and 58 70 according to scott et al 2006 table 5 the relatively high values obtained by scott et al 2006 reflect only the growing season and the values are likely lower on an annual scale therefore the t et values of the studied shrublands appear to respond to differences in climatic characteristics on the other hand the t et values in the banzhai subtropical evergreen forest are higher than those of both tropical rainforest and temperate deciduous forest it is not reasonable for the t et values in a subtropical evergreen forest to be considerably higher than those in a tropical rainforest but the values are relatively comparable to global isotope based estimates derived by jasechko et al 2013 this pattern in banzhai is mainly due to a combination of a lack of high resolution precipitation samples which introduces considerable uncertainty when estimating the initial value of groundwater this process underestimates evaporation and consequently overestimates transpiration additionally many previously summarized estimates schlesinger and jasechko 2014 were made at the stand level and may underestimate transpiration paco et al 2009 therefore owing to the uncertainty in separating water cycle and the scarcity of studies in southern asia further study on the water cycle in southwestern china is needed in the future especially at the catchment scale 5 conclusions 1 lmwls are established for the study areas the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls for banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe differ from those of the gwml and the meteoric water line for china reflecting different climatic conditions for example the lmwl for the banzhai catchment has a lower slope and intercept which may be the result of below cloud evaporation of precipitation related to relatively high temperatures in the area 2 the response of the isotopic composition of groundwater to precipitation varies with land cover type in the banzhai catchment an area with a primary forest floor but relatively thin soil cover the δd and δ18o values of groundwater respond quickly to precipitation and vary to a large extent and the δd and δ18o values of groundwater are close to those of precipitation in the rainy season in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments owing to thicker soil layers with sparse vegetation and large numbers of paddy fields in the catchments the δd and δ18o shift to higher values and vary less compared with precipitation 3 the degree of evaporation in dengzhanhe is larger than chenqi and banzhai with evaporation of 14 1 in dengzhanhe 6 4 in chenqi and 0 in banzhai this difference is mainly due to the different land cover types in the three catchments 4 based on the high resolution continuous meteorological and discharge data evapotranspiration rates et were calculated combined with evaporation ratios e derived from the excess deuterium d method the transpiration ratios t were estimated as well the t values are 78 in banzhai 10 4 in chenqi and 24 1 in dengzhanhe and the differences among these areas are mainly attributable to differences in vegetation types the t et values of the three catchments are 63 in chenqi 68 in dengzhanhe and 100 in banzhai hence the characteristics of the stable isotopes of karst groundwater are strong indicators of the effects of the overlying land cover

7010,studying the spatial and temporal variations of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values δd and δ18o respectively in precipitation and groundwater in catchments with different land cover is of great significance to understanding the hydrologic cycles within the catchments this study is focused on three karst catchments banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe in guizhou province southwest china a region with a subtropical humid monsoon climate we analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in the δd and δ18o of precipitation and groundwater in these areas from september 2007 to september 2009 local meteoric water lines lmwls for the study areas and their relationships with groundwater were established the seasonal variations of δd and δ18o for both precipitation and groundwater were similar being depleted in the heavier isotopomer in the rainy season and enriched in the heavier isotopomer in the dry season the similarity of patterns between groundwater and precipitation indicates short groundwater residence times in the three catchments typical of karst terrains the isotopic values of the banzhai catchment which is covered by a thin soil layer beneath virgin forest floor had the largest variation among the three catchments the isotopic compositions of the banzhai catchment groundwater were close to those of precipitation in the rainy season and responded rapidly to it indicating that precipitation quickly recharges groundwater in this area in comparison in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments the thicker soil layers and large numbers of paddy fields and dry lands in the catchments resulted in more intense evaporation and therefore relatively higher isotopic values in the infiltration water consequently the isotopic values of spring water in these two areas were higher and varied to a lesser extent in the rainy season than those of precipitation the rayleigh fractionation model based on the correlation between the deuterium excess d and evaporation was employed in this study the model calculation results showed that the catchment evaporation was more intense in dengzhanhe than in chenqi with 14 1 and 6 4 of the water evaporated in dengzhanhe and chenqi respectively the higher percentage of evaporation in dengzhanhe was mainly due to the larger percentage of paddy fields in the catchment in contrast the effects of evaporation from free water surfaces or soil surfaces on groundwater in the virgin forest covered banzhai catchment were extremely weak based on the isotopic and high resolution continuous meteorological and discharge data the transpiration rates were estimated to be 78 for banzhai 10 4 for chenqi and 24 1 for dengzhanhe and the differences among these values are mainly attributed to differences in vegetation types in those areas these results show that the variation in stable isotopes in groundwater can be used as a key index in evaluating the effects of different land cover changes and environmental changes on the water cycle in a catchment keywords hydrogen and oxygen isotopes local meteoric water line groundwater karst catchment water cycle land cover 1 introduction the southwest china karst region is one of the largest karst areas among the major concentrated karst regions in the world a relatively large number of environmental issues have stemmed from the karst water cycle change caused by soil erosion rocky desertification and vegetation degeneration these latter environmental problems are closely related to human activities and different land uses land use plays an important role in catchment s water cycle for example different land uses can affect the hydrological process of a catchment and can affect the catchment water balance through influencing evapotranspiration bronstert et al 2002 raymond et al 2008 due to special hydrogeological conditions in karst areas e g less soil development strong karst leakage and etc ford and williams 2007 the factors that affect the catchment water cycle are varied and complex which makes the processes of precipitation and runoff in karst catchments very complicated therefore studying the water cycle pattern in karst regions under different land uses is of great significance to addressing regional environmental issues related to water cycle marfia et al 2004 in a catchment atmospheric precipitation passes through the unsaturated zone and recharges groundwater soil vegetation and lithology can all affect this recharge process clark and fritz 1997 jasechko et al 2013 studying the response of groundwater to atmospheric precipitation can provide guidance for understanding the mechanism of the complex recharge processes in a catchment since craig 1961 and dansgaard 1964 advanced the basic theory of water isotopes in the water cycle δd and δ18o have played important roles in studies of the water cycle δd and δ18o are extensively used in different scales of hydrological processes studies commonly individual rainstorm seasonal and annual scales identifying the seasonal variations of δd and δ18o in precipitation and groundwater can facilitate the evaluation of the mean groundwater residence time lindstrom and rodhe 1986 ramspacher et al 1992 research in non karst regions has shown relatively small seasonal variations of δd and δ18o in groundwater which markedly diminished and lagged the seasonal variations in precipitation indicating the groundwater residence time of generally more than one year dewalle et al 1997 δd and δ18o has also been used to examine rainstorm dynamics in catchments and then reflect the aquifer parameters under rainstorm conditions lyon et al 2009 in this study we will show that stable isotope responses in a karst terrain on multiple scales differ greatly from those in non karst terrains quantifying water cycle processes e g runoff evaporation and transpiration in a catchment is often difficult because evapotranspiration consists of both physical evaporation from surfaces and biological transpiration telmer and veizer 2000 globally research on the quantification of evapotranspiration has been mostly focused on arid and semiarid regions in china similar research is mainly concentrated on the north region whereas very few studies have examined southern regions where the climate is warm and humid and the vegetation is dense schlesinger and jasechko 2014 there are three main approaches used to study evapotranspiration field measurement models and isotopic methods sutanto et al 2014 field measurement methods are mainly based on physical parameters related to evaporation process such as humidity wind speed and solar radiation the eddy covariance ec method is the most commonly used field measurement method while the ec method is relatively accurate for fixed points it may be problematic when applied to a larger scale e g catchment scale telmer and veizer 2000 in addition some physical parameters involved in the ec method are relatively difficult and costly to acquire modeling is an extension of field measurement methods but requires validation and correction against measured data in practical applications the introduction of isotopic methods has significantly advanced quantitative research on water cycles in catchments without high accuracy meteorological instrument measurements telmer and veizer 2000 the conventional method for determining evaporation in a catchment is based on difference of δd and δ18o between groundwater and meteoric precipitation first the initial isotopic composition of groundwater in the catchment is determined the initial composition is usually taken as the values at the intersection point of the evaporation and meteoric water lines of the catchment kendall and caldwell 1998 the amount of evaporation can then be calculated gonfiantini 1986 telmer and veizer 2000 lee and veizer 2003 however the δd and δ18o in large catchments may have relatively large variation a more powerful derivative stable isotope parameter deuterium excess d is unrelated to the isotopic composition of precipitation but instead is related to its sources and subsequent processes for this reason waters with different δd and δ18o may exhibit the same d value clark and fritz 1997 huang and pang 2012 moreover the d in a catchment reflects degree of evaporation the more intense evaporation is the lower d value is dansgaard 1964 while the d value and δd and δ18o values are all related to evaporation the d value is more stable and conducive to the investigation of evaporation in a catchment than the δd and δ18o values the three catchments of banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe in guizhou southwest china each under different land uses were selected as the study areas in this project precipitation and groundwater samples were collected during two consecutive hydrological years september 2007 through september 2009 this study reveals the δd and δ18o variation patterns of karst groundwater under these different land uses and demonstrates the dynamics of water cycle processes in karst catchments 2 general information about the study areas banzhai catchment situated in the maolan national karst forest nature reserve in libo county guizhou the banzhai catchment 107 55 108 05 e 25 12 25 15 n fig 1 is part of the liujiang river system in the pearl river basin and encompasses an area of approximately 19 km2 fig 2 this catchment has a multi year 30 years annual mean temperature of 18 3 c a multi year 30 years annual mean precipitation of about 1750 mm which mainly occurs in may through october and a multi year 30 years annual mean relative humidity of 80 zhou 1987 bedrock comprises middle carboniferous dolomitic limestone c2 and lower carboniferous c1d 3 marl and shale zeng et al 2016 the soil in this area is mainly black limestone soil 0 2 m thick with a discontinuous distribution covering less than 10 of the whole catchment area it is primarily found in karst valley bottoms and is used as farmland fig 2 the soil is thin and discontinuous and surface water is absent zhou 1987 in the catchment the elevation is higher in the west and lower in the east and the landscape is a typical peak cluster karst the main groundwater aquifer is the dolomitic limestone of c2 that is 586 m thick while the underlying c1d 3 aquitard is marl and shale that is 175 m thick the aquitard is only sporadically exposed near the banzhai station the sampling site in fig 2 the carbonates that constitute aquifers are not folded but have a tabular disposition they were affected by faults which led to the development of karst fissures and conduits zeng 2009 many sink holes occur along the karst valleys these provide infiltration pathways to the aquifer essentially when precipitation falls on the banzhai catchment it infiltrates and passes through the fissures and channels of c2 and finally discharges at the mouth of banzhai catchment banzhai station the banzhai catchment has not been significantly affected by human activities therefore primary karst forest is the main land cover the entire catchment has a high forest coverage percentage greater than90 zhou 1987 zeng 2009 however most of the trees grow directly on carbonate rocks with little or no soil chenqi and dengzhanhe karst spring catchments located within the well known houzhai karst stream catchment 105 42 105 43 e 26 14 26 15 n in puding county guizhou the interconnected chenqi and dengzhanhe karst spring catchments fig 3 are parts of the wujiang river system in the yangtze river basin fig 1 the houzhai catchment has a subtropical humid monsoon climate with wet weather and abundant precipitation in warm summers this area has a multi year 30 years annual mean temperature of 15 1 c a multi year 30 years annual mean precipitation of 1315 mm and a multi year 30 years annual mean relative humidity of 78 zhao et al 2010 in addition precipitation mainly occurs in the rainy season may to october which coincides with high temperatures rainy season precipitation accounts for more than 80 of the annual total wan et al 1998 chen et al 2005 the chenqi and dengzhanhe spring catchments encompass areas of 1 31 and 2 82 km2 respectively fig 3 the lithology is the middle triassic guanling formation t2g which is mainly composed of limestone and dolomite intercalated with marl and shale zhao et al 2010 the carbonates that constitute aquifers are not folded but have a tabular disposition they were affected by faults which led to the development of karst fissures and conduits yang et al 2001 the geomorphology of both catchments is categorized as karst peak cluster valley the quaternary q limestone soil with relatively low permeability is mainly distributed in the karst valley bottoms and has been cultivated as paddy fields and dryland non irrigated cropland fig 4 the aquifers in the two catchments are the q limestone soil varying from 0 m to 15 m thick and the limestone and dolomite of t2g2 t2g3 with a thickness of 897 m fig 3 the 200 m thick underlying aquitard composed of the marl and shale of t2g1 is not exposed in the studied catchments elevations of chenqi and dengzhanhe spring catchments are higher in the northeast and lower in the southwest the lowest elevation being 1310 m the highest elevation in chenqi spring catchment it is 1524 m while in the dengzhanhe spring catchment is 1559 m zhao et al 2010 the elevations of the chenqi spring and the dengzhanhe spring are the lowest points in their own drainage areas there are sink holes and estavelles along the karst valley from the northeast to the southwest of both catchments making the karst valley the main runoff zone the chenqi and dengzhanhe springs are the final outlets in their respective karst systems the chenqi and dengzhanhe spring catchments are significantly affected by human activities with the main land use types in these catchments table 1 fig 4 include paddy fields dryland and shrubland the paddy fields 14 in the chenqi catchment are mainly distributed in the runoff area in contrast the paddy fields 19 in the dengzhanhe spring catchment are mainly distributed in its both recharge and runoff areas no matter where the paddy fields of catchments are located whether they are in the upper recharge area or lower runoff area they are in valley bottoms or the lower reaches of epikarst springs which provide good foundation for cultivation therefore the paddy fields of both catchments are mainly recharged by their upstream epikarst springs and precipitation and will recharge the groundwater beneath them and finally discharge to the catchment outlets chenqi and dengzhanhe springs respectively figs 3 and 4 however the dryland area in the chenqi spring catchment accounts for a significantly higher proportion of the total catchment area 56 than that in the dengzhanhe spring catchment 44 in both spring catchments vegetation has been severely damaged by felling and mostly degraded to shrubland severe rocky desertification of these karst areas is apparent the shrubland area accounts for 30 and 37 of the total catchment area in chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments respectively 3 research methods 3 1 sampling and analysis from september 2007 to september 2009 the groundwater in the three catchment stations was sampled once a month precipitation samples were removed from collectors immediately after each precipitation event ended some precipitation samples were discarded if samples could not be collected immediately when the rain stopped all of the samples were sealed with parafilm and stored at approximately 4 c high resolution continuous discharge and meteorological data were obtained using automatic data loggers with a multi parameter water quality meter model ctdp300 zeng et al 2016 all samples were analyzed at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry the institute of geochemistry of the chinese academy of sciences δ18o values of rainwater and groundwater samples were measured using gv isoprime continuous flow mass spectrometer cf irms the δd values of all samples were measured using the cf irms after the water sample equilibrated in a vial with h2 gas using platinum wire as the catalyst sun and liu 2010 we used national standard gbw04401 gbw04402 gbw04403 gbw04404 as our in house reference materials and their reference values are δdvsmow 0 4 δ18ovsmow 0 32 δdvsmow 64 8 δ18ovsmow 8 79 δdvsmow 189 1 δ18ovsmow 24 52 and δdvsmow 428 3 δ18ovsmow 55 16 respectively jin et al 1991 the measurements were represented by the δd and δ18o values relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and the systematic analytical errors for the δd and δ18o values were less than 2 and 0 2 respectively the standard deviation of δd and δ18o measurement is 1σ 3 2 evapotranspiration calculation using the water balance method the evapotranspiration of a catchment can be estimated through the water balance method proposed by wisler and brater 1959 which is shown in eq 1 1 et p r δ s where et is evapotranspiration p is precipitation r is runoff and s is the change in groundwater storage in this study s is close to zero because the time for calculation is two hydrological years then the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation evapotranspiration rate can be estimated by eq 2 2 et p r p 3 3 evaporation estimation using the d excess method craig 1961 discovered a specific linear relationship between δ18o and δd of global precipitation i e the global meteoric water line gmwl 3 δ d 8 δ 18 o 10 4 δ d v smow r s r st 1 1000 5 δ 18 o v smow r s r st 1 1000 where rs and rst are the d h ratio of the sample and the standard respectively in eq 4 and the 18o 16o ratio of the sample and the standard respectively in eq 5 dansgaard 1964 defined a new parameter deuterium excess 6 d δ d 8 δ 18 o it can be deduced from the gmwl that the mean d value of global precipitation is 10 which is mainly controlled by such factors as the humidity and temperature in the water vapor source area as well as evaporation friedman et al 1992 smith et al 1992 because the evaporation component undergoes evolution as described by the rayleigh process clark and fritz 1997 it is assumed that the evaporation of groundwater follows rayleigh fractionation i e 7 r s r 0 s f α 1 based on eqs 4 and 5 we use δ instead of r for convenience and thus the rayleigh fractionation is expressed by δ as is shown in eq 8 8 δ δ 0 1000 f α 1 1000 then based on eqs 6 and 8 we have 9 d δ d 0 1000 f α d 1 1000 8 δ 18 o 0 1000 f α 18 o 1 1000 δ d 0 1000 f α d 1 8 δ 18 o 0 1000 f α 18 o 1 7000 in the above equation f is the residual fraction of groundwater and α is the fractionation factor that includes both the equilibrium and the kinetic fractionation factors α 1 α ε α is an equilibrium fractionation factor related only to temperature eqs 10 and 11 and ε is a dynamic enrichment factor which is related to humidity h eqs 12 and 13 gonfiantini 1986 clark and fritz 1997 majoube 1971 δ18o0 and δd0 are the initial isotopic compositions of groundwater and d is the d excess of groundwater which is calculated from the isotopic compositions of groundwater 10 1000 ln α d 24 844 10 6 t 2 76 248 10 3 t 52 612 11 1000 ln α 18 o 1 137 10 6 t 2 0 4156 10 3 t 2 0667 12 δ ε d 12 5 1 h 1000 13 δ ε 18 o 14 2 1 h 1000 therefore based on climatic characteristics multi year average temperature and humidity zhou 1987 and the initial and current isotopic compositions of groundwater in each selected catchment the percentage of groundwater that evaporates e 1 f can be calculated using eq 9 for error analysis because the quantification is performed on the scale of two full hydrological years and the meteorological parameters temperature and humidity are multi year mean values zhou 1987 the error in the percentage of evaporated groundwater calculated using eq 9 is mainly attributed to the initial isotopic composition of groundwater the δd0 and δ18o0 values d δ d 0 1000 f α d 1 8 δ 18 o 0 1000 f α 18 o 1 7000 let a δd0 and b δ18o0 based on the error propagation equations the root mean square error rmse for the percentage of groundwater that evaporates is 14 s f f a 2 s a 2 f b 2 s b 2 15 f a f α d 1 a 1000 α d 1 f α d 2 8 b 1000 α 18 o 1 f α 18 o 2 16 f b 8 f α 18 o 2 a 1000 α d 1 f α d 2 8 b 1000 α 18 o 1 f α 18 o 2 where sa and sb are the rmses for δd0 and δ18o0 respectively therefore transpiration can be estimated by combining the evaporation through the d excess method eq 9 with evapotranspiration obtained through the water balance method eq 2 which is given in eq 17 in this paper transpiration is taken as the water loss to the atmosphere through plants including interception by plants 17 t et e 4 results and interpretation the statistical analysis shows that the δ18o values of precipitation in banzhai range from 13 66 to 1 12 with a mean value of 5 96 3 78 n 53 the δ18o values of precipitation in chenqi range from 14 47 to 3 36 with a mean value of 6 85 4 19 n 42 and the δ18o values of precipitation in dengzhanhe range from 18 39 to 1 52 with a mean value of 8 26 4 40 n 49 furthermore the δ18o values of groundwater in banzhai range from 9 71 to 5 36 with a mean value of 7 89 1 37 n 19 the δ18o values of groundwater in chenqi range from 9 31 to 6 55 with a mean value of 8 22 0 76 n 20 and the δ18o values of groundwater in dengzhanhe range from 10 18 to 6 30 with a mean value of 8 26 0 96 n 19 4 1 local meteoric water lines lmwls based on the δ18o and δd data of precipitation collected from september 2007 to september 2009 local meteoric water lines lmwls were established for the study areas due to low precipitation during the dry season and improper preservation of the samples only a relatively small number of dry season samples were collected from chenqi and dengzhanhe to better facilitate the analysis data collected from the study points in the houzhai subterranean stream catchment during the dry season are used as supplementary data for chenqi and dengzhanhe the lmwls for the study areas are as follows chenqi δd 8 77δ18o 18 59 dengzhanhe δd 8 56δ18o 18 47 and banzhai δd 7 44δ18o 4 20 fig 5 the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls for chenqi and dengzhanhe are higher than those of the gmwl proposed by craig 1961 δd 8δ18o 10 yurtsever 1975 δd 8 17δ18o 10 56 and hoefs 2009 δd 7 96 0 02 δ18o 8 86 0 17 and the meteoric water line for china proposed by zheng et al 1983 δd 7 9δ18o 8 2 in comparison the slope and intercept of the banzhai lmwl are lower than those of the meteoric water lines proposed by craig 1961 yurtsever 1975 and zheng et al 1983 these differences may occur because the aforementioned gmwls and meteoric water line for china were produced based on observational data acquired at various locations across the globe and across china respectively and are relatively homogenized results based on precipitation data from both dry and wet regions in this study data from each precipitation event is used unlike the monthly mean precipitation data used to create the global network of isotopes in precipitation the stable isotopic data for precipitation derived from precipitation events are more prone to the local effects of evaporation temperature and sampling time therefore the different slopes and intercepts of the lmwls established in this study reflect local climatic conditions in each of the catchments compared to the lmwls for chenqi and dengzhanhe the lmwl for the banzhai catchment has a lower slope and higher δd and δ18o values which can be attributed to the climatic characteristics of the catchment the banzhai catchment has a mid subtropical humid monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 18 3 c in contrast the chenqi and dengzhanhe karst spring catchments have a subtropical humid climate with an annual mean temperature of 15 1 c therefore the more intense below cloud evaporation of precipitation in banzhai results in a lower lmwl slope which is in fact an evaporation line and relatively higher δd and δ18o values in precipitation corroborated by the lower d value shown in section 4 3 the relationships between δd and δ18o of groundwater and the corresponding lmwl in each study area are shown in fig 6 for the distribution of δd and δ18o of groundwater collected during the rainy season may to october and dry season november to april of the following year the isotopic values of all groundwater samples fall near their respective lmwls indicating that groundwater in the study areas originates entirely from precipitation regardless of the season most δd and δ18o values of groundwater in the banzhai catchment fall above the lmwl and consequently the lmwl represents the evaporation line of groundwater fig 6 hence as previously noted most of the precipitation evaporated as it fell in banzhai however the groundwater in the banzhai catchment is mainly recharged by heavy precipitation events which are accompanied by weak below cloud evaporation moreover banzhai is an area with primary forest coverage of greater than 90 and evaporation from the soil surface is relatively weak thereby limiting evaporation from the catchment therefore slope of groundwater is higher than that of precipitation in banzhai because of recharged precipitation with weak below cloud evaporation and weak evaporation from the catchment most δd and δ18o values of groundwater in chenqi and dengzhanhe plot below their respective lmwls suggesting evaporation of groundwater which mainly results from the significant effects of land cover in chenqi and dengzhanhe fig 6 in these two areas paddy fields and dryland are the main land use types resulting in more intense evaporation from water and soil surfaces therefore in the catchments the isotopic compositions of groundwater not only responded to precipitation but also were influenced by land cover conditions 4 2 characteristics of seasonal variations in δd and δ18o values dansgaard 1964 derived the main factors that affect stable isotope values in precipitation from north pole observation data as the water vapor source conditions the thermal effect the precipitation effect the continental effect the altitude effect and the latitude effect etc the δd and δ18o values of precipitation are not only related to the local climate precipitation temperature etc but also closely linked to the water vapor transport process zheng et al 2009 wei and lin 1994 as shown in fig 7 the δd and δ18o values of precipitation and groundwater vary over time in the banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments the δd and δ18o values of precipitation exhibit notable seasonal variations these values are low in the rainy summer season and high in the dry winter season fig 7 this pattern occurs mainly because the research areas have a monsoon climate and water vapor in the summer originates mostly from low latitude oceanic areas this water vapor source has a relatively high humidity and easily forms strong convective weather events generating large volumes of precipitation which leads to the precipitation effect and produces isotopic depletions in summer araguas araguas et al 1998 during the winter cold and dry continental air masses are the main water vapor source for precipitation in guizhou the main water vapor sources in winter are moisture transported by the westerlies and inland recycled water vapor these systems have low humidity and produce relatively little precipitation as a result the δd and δ18o values of precipitation are higher in winter the δd and δ18o values of groundwater also exhibit notable seasonal variations in banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe the δd and δ18o values of groundwater are low in the rainy season and high in the dry season fig 7 seasonal variations in the isotopic values of groundwater are consistent with those of precipitation therefore the groundwater residence time is relatively short less than one year and runoff is discharged rapidly because the variation coefficients of δd and δ18o in banzhai are greater than those in chenqi and dengzhanhe table 2 the δd and δ18o values in banzhai vary more than those in chenqi and dengzhanhe in the rainy season the δd and δ18o values of banzhai groundwater is the closest to that of precipitation the three study areas are karst catchments with predominant fissure and conduit flows but the banzhai catchment 19 km2 is approximately 10 times larger than the chenqi 1 31 km2 and dengzhanhe 2 82 km2 catchments precipitation in the former catchment is intercepted by plants to a significantly larger extent than in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments because of the dense primary forests that grow in banzhai on the other hand the soil cover in the banzhai catchment is much thinner than in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments during rainfall events precipitation with low δd and δ18o values rapidly recharges the groundwater system in banzhai through exposed fissures and conduits and the buffering effect of soil is relatively weak because of the thin and discontinuous soil in combination these characteristics result in rapid recharge and discharge of water stored in the karst catchment as a result the δd and δ18o of groundwater in banzhai is close to that of precipitation like banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe karst catchments are also dominated by fissure and conduit flows but their δd and δ18o values of groundwater are notably higher than those of precipitation in the rainy season the difference in stable isotopes between groundwater and precipitation in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments is mainly attributed to thicker soil layers and different land uses the land use there is mainly dryland and shrubland where intense evaporation results from large expanses of exposed soil as a result when precipitation recharges groundwater it mixes with soil water that is affected by evaporation the buffering effect of soil and the groundwater has thus a heavier isotopic composition differing from that of precipitation in addition a large number of paddy fields are also distributed in both the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments and evaporation from the water surface results in heavier isotope values in the residual water because the perched water tables of the paddy fields are higher than the groundwater the heavier isotopic water in the paddy fields recharges the groundwater below and shifting isotopes to higher values in the dry season due to decreased precipitation the amount of water that infiltrates the soil and recharges groundwater is much less than in the wet season therefore precipitation plays a more significant role in replenishing the soil moisture that has been evaporated clark and fritz 1997 so that the isotopic composition of groundwater in the dry season differs from the isotopic composition of dry season precipitation 4 3 characteristics of the variations in the d value in the study areas in banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe the d values exhibit notable seasonal variations in precipitation fig 8 overall the d values are low in the rainy season and high in the dry season in banzhai the d value of precipitation ranges from 12 04 to 27 00 with a mean value of 7 57 6 42 n 43 the d value of precipitation varies from 0 96 to 23 68 with a mean value of 12 92 6 64 n 26 in chenqi and ranges from 1 07 to 23 87 with a mean value of 13 04 5 38 n 40 in dengzhanhe these trends are similar to that in chongqing li et al 2010 but are opposite to the trend of seasonal variations in the d value of precipitation in urumqi li and zhou 2007 suggesting different geographic locations and water vapor sources for precipitation fig 1 guizhou is located in a monsoon climate zone where the water vapor sources for precipitation in the dry season winter mainly consist of cold and dry air masses that are transported by the westerlies and inland re evaporated water vapor associated with continental air masses as a result overall precipitation in the dry season has high δd and δ18o values and a high d value in contrast the summer monsoon is intense in the rainy season during which water vapor mainly originates from high humidity warm and wet air masses with low d values from low latitude oceanic areas therefore the seasonal variations in the d value of precipitation in banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe are mainly caused by the difference between the water vapor sources in the rainy and dry seasons the mean d values of precipitation in chenqi and dengzhanhe are 10 higher than the value of the gmwl whereas the mean d values in banzhai are significantly lower than the value of the gmwl research has shown that precipitation that forms from recycled water vapor generated by evaporation from free water surfaces or soil surfaces has a high d value zhang 2008 while evaporation will cause the d value to be lower therefore it is likely that the relatively low d value of precipitation in banzhai is the result of below cloud evaporation of precipitation the d value of groundwater shows weak seasonal variations fig 8 in banzhai the d value ranges from 5 58 to 19 07 with a mean value of 10 85 3 11 n 19 the d value of chenqi ranges from 6 08 to 17 40 with a mean value of 9 94 2 76 n 20 the d value of dengzhanhe ranges from 0 36 to 16 96 with a mean value of 9 55 4 12 n 19 the relationship between δ18o and d of groundwater in the rainy and dry seasons in the study areas is shown in fig 9 there is a strong negative correlation between δ18o and d in the three catchments during the dry season whereas the correlation is weaker in the rainy season this may result from infiltration of large amounts of precipitation in the rainy season that mask the effects of evaporation on groundwater while evaporation effects are evident in the dry season when the amount of precipitation that infiltrates and recharges groundwater is limited although the groundwater in banzhai experienced evaporation during the dry season the effect of evaporation on the groundwater in banzhai on a full year scale is extremely weak as shown in fig 6 the negative correlation between δ18o and d reflects the influence of evaporation on groundwater therefore the isotopic composition of groundwater in chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments is closely linked to evaporation 4 4 partitioning evapotranspiration rates in the study catchments as noted above in the banzhai catchment almost all groundwater samples plot above the lmwl of banzhai which indicates that the groundwater has not experienced significant evaporation the groundwater in both the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments is affected by evaporation because most groundwater samples plot below their lmwl and are distributed along their evaporation lines fig 10 thus we discuss the effects of evaporation on groundwater only in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments the offset of isotopic composition represented by the length of the evaporation line between groundwater and its initial water the intersection of lmwl and evaporation line represents the degree of evaporation the larger the offset the higher the degree of evaporation clark and fritz 1997 huang and pang 2012 therefore the greatest groundwater evaporation in both the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments occurs in the rainy season reflecting the characteristics of the rainy season high temperatures and intense evaporation to analyze the differences between chenqi and dengzhanhe on multi year scale a two year mean of δd and δ18o of groundwater in the two catchments are used the length s2 between the two year mean of groundwater and the initial water in dengzhanhe is clearly longer than the length s1 in chenqi fig 10 therefore the degree of evaporation is stronger in dengzhanhe than in chenqi to quantify the evaporation rate in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments with different land cover patterns the evaporation of groundwater is assumed to follow rayleigh fractionation model puding has a multi year annual mean temperature of 15 1 c and a multi year annual mean humidity of 78 by using the initial and current isotopic compositions of groundwater and eq 9 the evaporation rates are calculated to be 6 in chenqi and 14 in dengzhanhe table 3 based on the error propagation eqs 14 15 and 16 the absolute errors of groundwater that evaporates are 4 and 1 for the chenqi and dengzhanhe spring catchments respectively the results obtained from calculations based on the rayleigh fractionation model are consistent with the qualitative analysis results shown in fig 10 indicating that the degree of evaporation in dengzhanhe is stronger than that in chenqi this is mainly because paddy fields account for a higher proportion of land use in dengzhanhe and evaporation from free water surfaces in the paddy fields can result in high δd and δ18o and low d values which in turn affects groundwater in the catchment through infiltration based on the high resolution continuous meteorological and discharge data collected during the studied period the evapotranspiration rates et can be calculated using eqs 1 and 2 combined with the evaporation rates e derived from the d method the transpiration rates t can be estimated as well the t is 78 for banzhai 10 4 for chenqi and 24 1 for dengzhanhe table 4 the differences among these values are mainly attributable to differences in vegetation types the strongest transpiration rates in the banzhai catchment result from the presence of primary forest with dense vegetation the transpiration rates in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments are both lower than those in the banzhai catchment because their vegetation types are mainly sparse shrubland additionally the slightly higher transpiration rates in dengzhanhe than chenqi is due to the higher percentage of shrub cover in this catchment table 1 therefore the land cover does significantly impact the catchment water cycle 4 5 comparing the t et with studies elsewhere in the world the ratio of t to et expressed as a percentage of the three catchments are 62 5 in chenqi 63 2 in dengzhanhe and 100 in banzhai table 4 these values indicate that the water cycle through evapotranspiration in karst catchments is also dominantly controlled by transpiration the global mean being 61 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 it is noteworthy that the t et values in chenqi and dengzhanhe subtropical shrublands are equal or higher than those of mediterranean shrubland 39 60 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 and semiarid shrubland 42 47 according to cavanaugh et al 2011 and 58 70 according to scott et al 2006 table 5 the relatively high values obtained by scott et al 2006 reflect only the growing season and the values are likely lower on an annual scale therefore the t et values of the studied shrublands appear to respond to differences in climatic characteristics on the other hand the t et values in the banzhai subtropical evergreen forest are higher than those of both tropical rainforest and temperate deciduous forest it is not reasonable for the t et values in a subtropical evergreen forest to be considerably higher than those in a tropical rainforest but the values are relatively comparable to global isotope based estimates derived by jasechko et al 2013 this pattern in banzhai is mainly due to a combination of a lack of high resolution precipitation samples which introduces considerable uncertainty when estimating the initial value of groundwater this process underestimates evaporation and consequently overestimates transpiration additionally many previously summarized estimates schlesinger and jasechko 2014 were made at the stand level and may underestimate transpiration paco et al 2009 therefore owing to the uncertainty in separating water cycle and the scarcity of studies in southern asia further study on the water cycle in southwestern china is needed in the future especially at the catchment scale 5 conclusions 1 lmwls are established for the study areas the slopes and intercepts of the lmwls for banzhai chenqi and dengzhanhe differ from those of the gwml and the meteoric water line for china reflecting different climatic conditions for example the lmwl for the banzhai catchment has a lower slope and intercept which may be the result of below cloud evaporation of precipitation related to relatively high temperatures in the area 2 the response of the isotopic composition of groundwater to precipitation varies with land cover type in the banzhai catchment an area with a primary forest floor but relatively thin soil cover the δd and δ18o values of groundwater respond quickly to precipitation and vary to a large extent and the δd and δ18o values of groundwater are close to those of precipitation in the rainy season in the chenqi and dengzhanhe catchments owing to thicker soil layers with sparse vegetation and large numbers of paddy fields in the catchments the δd and δ18o shift to higher values and vary less compared with precipitation 3 the degree of evaporation in dengzhanhe is larger than chenqi and banzhai with evaporation of 14 1 in dengzhanhe 6 4 in chenqi and 0 in banzhai this difference is mainly due to the different land cover types in the three catchments 4 based on the high resolution continuous meteorological and discharge data evapotranspiration rates et were calculated combined with evaporation ratios e derived from the excess deuterium d method the transpiration ratios t were estimated as well the t values are 78 in banzhai 10 4 in chenqi and 24 1 in dengzhanhe and the differences among these areas are mainly attributable to differences in vegetation types the t et values of the three catchments are 63 in chenqi 68 in dengzhanhe and 100 in banzhai hence the characteristics of the stable isotopes of karst groundwater are strong indicators of the effects of the overlying land cover

7011,economic losses caused by flash floods are expected to rise worldwide in the coming decades which is largely due to the increasing exposure of elements at risk therefore a comprehensive analysis of the economic context of the potentially affected areas is highly recommendable numerous papers have been published to date that focus on quantifying vulnerability in general and in areas affected by floods in particular however the number of studies devoted to flash flood prone areas is far lower integrated economic vulnerability assessment enables one to learn what characteristics explain trigger intensify and attenuate the exposure sensitivity and resilience of economically vulnerable populations which can be combined to achieve an integrated economic vulnerability index ievi the methodology deployed here was conducted in castilla y león northwest spain 94 223 km2 and has allowed the economic vulnerability of urban areas to be analyzed which has been primarily addressed by the estimation of economic losses or more recently including a few economic variables within social vulnerability assessments thus 118 economic variables were initially gathered and then divided into groups through a hierarchical segmentation analysis subsequently variables were combined employing a principal components analysis giving rise to the economic vulnerability factors that were subsequently aggregated to construct the ievi tolerance statistic was used as a weighting method to define the ievi whereas quintiles were chosen as a statistical criterion to map economic vulnerability as a final step latent class cluster analysis was implemented to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability our findings show that ievi scores have a high spatial variability and a high degree of complexity in the relationships among different vulnerability factors moreover they help to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability which makes the design of suitable vulnerability reduction strategies possible thereby improving the efficiency of flood risk management plans and policies keywords economic vulnerability vulnerability index flash flood risk management spatial patterns latent class cluster analysis 1 introduction over recent decades population growth inappropriate land use planning environmental degradation and increases in wealth together with the effects of global climate change have been found to be the leading causes of the increasing losses caused by the impact of natural hazards van der veen and logtmeijer 2005 mechler and bouwer 2015 regarding mountainous areas the increase in the number of flood events and associated losses are primarily due to i the increasing exposure of elements at risk fuchs et al 2015 ii natural flood frequency fluctuations schmocker fackel and naef 2010 and iii the effects of climate change huggel et al 2012 flash floods are considered to be one of the natural hazards with the highest capacity to generate risk i e the potential loss of life harm or damaged assets which could occur to a society as a result of a natural hazard event determined by combining hazard exposure and vulnerability unisdr 2016 regarding both the socio economic and human impact on a global scale barredo 2007 marchi et al 2010 borga 2013 terti et al 2015 the above is mainly due to the fact that flash flood events happen very quickly which significantly reduces the warning and response times of the population and relevant civil protection agencies creutin et al 2009 borga 2013 bodoque et al 2015 despite the efforts of practitioners decision makers stakeholders and public administrations over the last decades to reduce the effects of flash floods the number of events and associated economic and human lives losses are still increasing all over the world birkmann et al 2013 munich re 2017 this trend highlights the need to continue improving disaster risk reduction strategies traditional strategies for reducing disaster risk opt for total control and protection against flood risk which mainly involves the design and the implementation of structural mitigation measures e g deflection and retention facilities check dams levees holub and fuchs 2009 such structures are particularly difficult to maintain in mountainous regions due to the limited availability of financial resources which determines structural protection is usually accompanied by land use planning and other legal regulations e g building codes mandatory insurances risk mapping tompkins et al 2012 unisdr 2015 papathoma köhle and thaler 2018 and local structural protection mainly through an adapted construction design of elements at risk holub and hübl 2008 holub and fuchs 2009 since it is not possible to guarantee complete safety risk management is currently directed toward recognizing risk and making people aware of and prepared to live with risk birkmann et al 2013 borga 2013 the united nations has been working along these lines since the adoption of the international strategy for disaster reduction 1990 1999 and the subsequent publication of the different frameworks i e the hyogo framework for action in force until 2015 and the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction to be developed during the period 2015 2030 their primary objective is the construction of societies that are more resilient vis a vis the effects of natural hazards in order to reduce human economic and social losses unisdr 2015 to this end the development of a system of indicators of disaster risk and vulnerability is viewed as a critical requirement this approach could help decision makers to assess the potential impact of natural hazards it could also promote the formulation of appropriate policy responses and identify the most vulnerable social groups and areas eakin and luers 2006 birkmann et al 2013 allowing flood risk analysis and management to be improved frazier et al 2014 papathoma köhle 2016 numerous papers focusing on vulnerability have been published in the field of natural hazards birkmann et al 2013 martín et al 2017 wen et al 2017 regarding flash floods approaches followed so far have mainly focused on the physical dimension kappes et al 2012 zelenáková et al 2015 karagiorgos et al 2016c papathoma köhle 2016 and to a lesser extent on the social dimension of vulnerability balteanu et al 2015 aroca jimenez et al 2017 mahmood et al 2017 many flood vulnerability studies have been carried out in large settlements located close to big drainage basins of major rivers with response times of hours or even days e g elbe danube and rhine basins fekete 2009 or south atlantic division usa cutter et al 2013 this is quite a different problem than the one found at small watersheds where flash floods take place however to date research devoted to characterizing economic vulnerability due to flash floods has been scarce the characterization of this vulnerability dimension could help local decision makers to efficiently manage the available economic resources to deal with flood risk which can be limited at flash flood prone areas few 2003 mcdowell and hess 2012 khazai et al 2013 as regards the above the economic dimension of vulnerability has been mainly addressed through damage estimations i e evaluating replacement economic costs fuchs 2009 karagiorgos et al 2016a which does not necessarily reflect the economic vulnerability of a system khazai et al 2013 other authors such as van der veen and logtmeijer 2005 evaluated the economic vulnerability of a flood prone area in the netherlands through the assessment of the indirect economic costs resulting from a levee failure however as stated above economic costs estimations cannot correctly reflect the economic vulnerability of a place assessing vulnerability usually consists of the construction of vulnerability indices representing the inherent characteristics or qualities of social systems that create the potential for harm i e pre event or pre existing vulnerability cutter et al 2003 2008 de loyola hummell et al 2016 as well as considering the static nature of society i e without taking account of daily mobility or activity of people terti et al 2015 in this regard it is a common practice to include some economic variables in social vulnerability analysis cutter et al 2003 fekete 2009 frazier et al 2014 nevertheless the number of economic variables that are usually included is remarkably reduced so there can be some aspects of the economic dimension of vulnerability that are not considered including among them information related to the different economic sectors or utilities balteanu et al 2015 rahman et al 2016 debortoli et al 2017 the united nations office for disaster risk reduction unisdr defines vulnerability as the conditions determined by physical social economic and environmental factors or processes which increase the susceptibility of an individual a community assets or systems to the impacts of hazards unisdr 2016 vulnerability is a function of exposure i e the proximity of people and societal assets to the hazard sensitivity i e the level of impact the hazard has on people and societal assets and resilience i e the ability of a community and societal assets to resist absorb accommodate adapt to transform and recover from the effects of the hazard turner et al 2003 adger 2006 füssel 2007 therefore vulnerability analysis should consider all the vulnerability dimensions i e social economic physical institutional cultural and environmental and components i e exposure sensitivity and resilience to assess vulnerability holistically karagiorgos et al 2016b papathoma köhle 2016 numerous papers have been published in which only sensitivity is evaluated cutter et al 2003 nelson et al 2015 de loyola hummell et al 2016 or resilience cutter et al 2010 siebeneck et al 2015 qasim et al 2016 nevertheless the use of the integrated approach to assess vulnerability is becoming more frequent i e including all the vulnerability components in vulnerability assessment and analyzing their interactions frazier et al 2014 terti et al 2015 aroca jimenez et al 2017 lian et al 2017 which provides a holistic view of vulnerability conversely multi dimensional vulnerability assessments proposed thus far are only theoretical approaches that recommend key variables of the different vulnerability dimensions which could serve as a basis for a future methodology but they do not suggest a practical analysis method fuchs 2009 menoni et al 2012 birkmann et al 2013 thus the objective of this paper is to construct a new economic vulnerability index in urban areas prone to flash flooding using an integrated approach to assessment to do that a set of economic variables were gathered and subsequently analyzed to construct the integrated economic vulnerability index ievi this analysis was based on applying a sequential statistical multivariate methodology which included i hierarchical segmentation analysis hsa to overcome the principal components analysis pca sample size limitation ii pca to extract the vulnerability factors and iii latent class cluster analysis lcca to identify economic vulnerability patterns within the urban areas which helped us to suggest specific mitigation measures for each cluster 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the proposed methodology has been tested in the region of castilla y león which is an autonomous region of spain 94 226 km2 representing almost 20 of the country s territory and one of the largest in europe fig 1 it is located between latitudes 40 05 and 43 14 n and longitudes 1 46 and 7 05 w its relief is primarily composed of a set of high altitude plains called meseta around 800 900 m a s l bordered by large mountain ranges around 2 000 m a s l the relief produces a predominantly mediterranean climate with some continental features the above results in significant thermal and rainfall gradients from the plains to the mountain systems i e from 10 to 2 c for temperatures and from 550 to 1 800 mm for rainfall regarding socioeconomic characteristics castilla y león has a population of more than 2 5 million it is administratively divided into 2 248 urban areas of which more than 84 have a population density of 20 inhabitants per square kilometer the rural depopulation that characterizes the region is a factor in the inability of an extraordinary number of mountainous urban areas to maintain resources and provide public services or the need to cope with high costs to do so martínez and delgado 2013 on the other hand the labor dependence ratio in these areas is 0 79 i e there are 79 dependents per 100 persons of working age the ageing population the livestock and agricultural sectors crisis and the existing obstacles to generating new economic initiatives result in extremely limited economic dynamism in these urban areas which highlights the need to properly manage the available economic resources molina 2012 2 2 database construction identification of urban areas of interest and selection of economic variables the first step in implementing the general methodology fig 2 was to identify those urban areas that could be affected by flash floods a set of restrictive conditions were implemented for this purpose using arcgis v10 1 software on the one hand the urban areas that were crossed by rivers with a longitudinal slope higher than 0 01 m m 1 were discriminated bodoque et al 2015 to apply this requirement a digital terrain model with a cell size of 200 200 m provided by the spanish national geographic institute ign http centrodedescargas cnig es was employed to compute river slopes using the geospatial hydrologic modeling extension hec geohms http www hec usace army mil software hec geohms meanwhile the urban areas that were identified as areas with potential significant flood risk apsfrs and the hazard areas with low or exceptional probability of flooding return period of 500 years were selected this cartography was provided by the spanish ministry of agriculture and fisheries food and environment mapama http www mapama gob es es cartografia y sig ide descargas agua default aspx and they derive from directive 2007 60 ce regarding flood risk assessment and management as a result 39 urban areas met the above mentioned specifications for which the economic database was created in light of existing literature and considering the economic context of the region cutter et al 2003 merz et al 2010 molinari et al 2014 weis et al 2016 mahmood et al 2017 a set of 118 economic variables were initially described for each of the 39 urban territories recognized previously most variables were taken directly from public databases e g variables related to unemployment by economic sectors or related to dwellings characteristics or maintenance or estimated from geographic information e g variables related to lifelines and infrastructures such as bridges or sewage treatment plants some of them were calculated on the basis of data from public organizations e g unemployment rate or per capita income variables were subsequently standardized and a bivariate correlation test was performed to discard redundant variables i e variables with an absolute correlation coefficient above 0 9 mooi and sarstedt 2014 finally 31 variables were employed in the statistical analysis table 1 see also supplementary data and these were classified into 5 thematic groups i employment and municipal economic situation 7 variables related to the employment situation and economic indicators ii private housing and fleet 11 variables associated with the housing typology and conservation status and vehicles iii public sector 4 variables linked to public facilities iv municipal infrastructures 7 variables related to municipal facilities and infrastructures and v agricultural sector 2 variables linked to the agricultural sector which is a key factor in the economy of castilla y león 2 3 exploratory analysis of variables the statistical analysis of variables involved two steps see fig 2 which were conducted using spss ibm spss statistics v 19 it is not recommended to perform a pca when the number of urban areas of interest is not at least three times higher than the number of variables maccallum et al 1999 therefore it was necessary to previously implement a hierarchical segmentation analysis hsa to overcome this pca sample size limitation 2 3 1 segmentation of variables into groups hsa is a multivariate statistical technique with the goal of dividing a set of variables into groups mooi and sarstedt 2014 whereas a variable in a particular group should be as similar as possible to all the other variables in the same group it should likewise be as distinct as possible from variables of different groups the similarity is calculated by estimating the distance between pairs of variables variables with smaller distances between one another are more similar and variables with larger distances are more dissimilar the squared euclidean distance was used here as the distance measure i e the sum of the squared differences between variable values mooi and sarstedt 2014 on the other hand ward s method was used as a grouping method which seeks to minimize the within group variance mooi and sarstedt 2014 this method uses agglomerative hierarchical algorithms these algorithms follow a hierarchical process where initially each variable represents an individual group and they are then sequentially merged according to their similarity this method is considered to be one of the most effective especially when the sample size is small martín et al 2015 the graphical output of the hsa i e dendrogram was used to decide the optimal number of groups in which variables were going to be divided 2 3 2 identification of economic vulnerability factors once variables were divided into groups a pca was performed in each of them pca allows the number of variables initially considered to be summarized through the linear combination thereof they are called principal components or factors and explain most of the variance embedded in the original variables the kaiser meyer olkin kmo statistic and the bartlett s test of sphericity were used to test whether the variables considered were appropriate for performing the pca i e kmo 0 6 and p value 0 05 respectively mooi and sarstedt 2014 pca uses correlation matrix between variables to extract the factors variables that comprise one factor have a certain amount of correlation while factors are uncorrelated and they cover distinct and unrelated aspects mooi and sarstedt 2014 factor loadings show the correlation between factors and variables high factor loadings indicate that a variable is well represented by a specific factor on the other hand communality assesses how much of each variable variance is captured by the factors extracted variables with communality values below 0 5 were eliminated from the analysis and the process was replicated finally a least squares regression method was used to calculate factor scores mooi and sarstedt 2014 which were employed to construct the ievi 2 4 construction of the integrated economic vulnerability index ievi factor scores were standardized to a mean of zero and they took values above or below zero depending on whether urban areas exhibited the characteristics described by a factor above or below the average mooi and sarstedt 2014 traditionally factors that increase vulnerability i e factors associated to exposure and sensitivity component are introduced into indices as positive values while factors that decrease vulnerability i e factors related to resilience component are introduced as negative values frazier et al 2014 de loyola hummell et al 2016 based on the above we turned around the sign of some factor scores by multiplying them by 1 finally ievi was calculated using the eq 1 adapted from frazier et al 2014 1 ievi e s r where ievi is the integrated economic vulnerability index e is exposure s is sensitivity and r is resilience each vulnerability component was estimated according to the eq 2 adapted from frazier et al 2014 2 v c f 1 n w f p f where v c is a vulnerability component exposure sensitivity or resilience w f is the weight assigned to the f factor and p f is the factor score of the f factor for instance if a vulnerability component is comprised of three factors n 3 its value corresponds to the sum of the three factor scores multiplied by their respective weights the weighting method was based here on the tolerance statistic which is a statistical test used in regression analysis to detect collinearity mooi and sarstedt 2014 thus those vulnerability factors that were less correlated with the others had a higher weight allocated in the ievi 2 5 recognition of spatial economic vulnerability patterns latent class cluster analysis lcca was implemented using the software latent gold 4 5 it is a statistical modeling technique which was performed with the aim of pinpointing economic vulnerability patterns within the study region lcca enabled us to identify unobserved heterogeneity by dividing the urban areas of interest into clusters to do this a categorical latent variable was created which indicated the cluster to which each urban area belonged to vermunt and magidson 2002 the cluster was determined by estimating the probability of belonging to a specific cluster according to the features of the vulnerability factors five models were assessed one no sample heterogeneity to five clusters sample heterogeneity with five patterns being considered the optimal number of clusters was determined by the minimum values of the bayesian information criterion bic and the consistent akaike s information criterion caic vermunt and magidson 2002 finally the model profile i e the marginal distribution of values of each vulnerability factor within each cluster haughton et al 2009 associated with the optimal model enabled us to ascertain the economic vulnerability sources for each cluster identified 3 results 3 1 integrated economic vulnerability index ievi and vulnerability mapping the results obtained in the hsa are displayed in the dendrogram fig 3 economic variables were divided into five groups after approximately nine iterations of the hierarchical algorithms these groups contained from 3 to 9 variables although the groups were not homogeneous in terms of the number of variables they were coherent regarding the meaning of variables included thus the first group contained variables related to the potential damage to municipal facilities and the labor system the second group was associated with the individual economic situation and the potential damage to houses the third group contained variables concerning the potential damage to municipal infrastructures and utilities the fourth group was composed of variables related to housing type and state of conservation finally the fifth group was made up of municipal economic indicators performing a pca in each of the five groups identified by the hsa resulted in the extraction of 8 vulnerability factors 1 potential job losses 2 urban environment 3 economic situation of households 4 economic situation of municipalities 5 municipal infrastructures and facilities 6 potentially floodable dwellings 7 municipal investments 8 vehicle fleet factor names were assigned considering the variable loadings within each vulnerability factor which also allowed them to be categorized by vulnerability component thus exposure component was made up of factors 2 5 and 6 sensitivity component included factors 1 4 and 8 and resilience component was comprised of factors 3 and 7 the percentage of explained variance was above 50 in all vulnerability factors in addition kmo statistics were higher than 0 6 and bartlett s tests of sphericity values were statistically significant p value 0 05 correlation coefficients were shown instead of kmo values in those cases in which vulnerability factors were formed by two variables whose coefficients were also statistically significant p 0 05 table 2 factor scores associated with each vulnerability factor were mapped using the quintiles classification method i e 20th 40th 60th and 80th percentiles five classes were established i very high ii high iii medium iv low and v very low fig 4 for exposure and sensitivity factors red was the color used for the very high category and blue for the very low category however colors were reversed for resilience factors to facilitate understanding of the map using blue for the very high category and red for the very low fig 5 shows the relationships between the ievi values and their vulnerability components i e exposure sensitivity and resilience urban areas were colored according to the ievi values using the quintiles classification method described above in this case red corresponds to very high category i e very high vulnerability while blue corresponds to very low category i e very low vulnerability ievi defines values that range from 0 108 to 0 107 the urban areas with the highest ievi values being located in the west of the region león province see fig 1 and the lowest values in the east soria province see fig 1 on the other hand ievi values were decomposed into the values of the different vulnerability components which were represented using bar charts bar heights depend on the vulnerability component values and bar colors indicate the categories in which the vulnerability component values are found according to the quintiles classification method moreover bar directions indicate the vulnerability component signs which depend on whether vulnerability component values are above component average i e positive values or below component average i e negative values 3 2 spatial economic vulnerability patterns the minimum values of bic and caic determined that the optimal model was the one which considered three clusters of urban areas table 3 the above means that although we would increase the disaggregation level of clusters i e considering the model with four or five clusters of urban areas and thus the number of estimated parameters it would not significantly raise the information explained by the model the parameters associated to the selected model show that potential job losses and municipal investments factors were not statistically significant in dividing urban areas into clusters p value 0 05 so they were not considered in clusters segregation table 4 finally spatial patterns were extracted from the model profile fig 6 shows on the one hand the cluster to which each urban area belongs on the other hand the representative urban area of each cluster has an associated bar chart that depicts the profile of each recognized pattern the representative urban areas were calculated considering the number of matches between the sign of the vulnerability factors values associated to each urban area and the sign of the vulnerability factors values associated to each cluster bar values correspond to the standard deviations from the means for each vulnerability factor of each cluster moreover bar directions reveal the sign of the standard deviation values which can be positive i e higher exposure sensitivity or resilience than cluster mean values or negative i e lesser exposure sensitivity and resilience than cluster mean values thus clusters present the following characteristics cluster 1 includes 63 1 of urban areas a total of 25 and it is characterized by containing urban areas with the highest values of potentially floodable dwellings exposure factor and the lowest values of urban environment and municipal infrastructures and facilities exposure factors cluster 2 comprises 25 9 of urban areas a total of 10 and it is made up of urban areas with the highest values of urban environment and municipal infrastructures and facilities exposure factors in addition urban areas with the highest values of potentially floodable dwellings exposure factor are also found in this cluster i e standard deviation values of the potentially floodable dwellings factor of clusters 1 and 2 are very similar regarding sensitivity component this cluster contains urban areas with the highest values of economic situation of municipalities factor and the lowest values of vehicle fleet factor on the other hand this cluster presents urban areas with the highest values of economic situation of households resilience factor cluster 3 includes 11 1 of urban areas a total of 4 and it contains urban areas with the lowest values of potentially floodable dwellings exposure factor regarding sensitivity component this cluster is made up of urban areas with the highest values of vehicle fleet factor and the lowest values of economic situation of municipalities factor regarding resilience component urban areas with the lowest values of economic situation of households factor are found here according to the results described above it appears that ievi values are related to the clusters of urban areas in this regard an analysis of variance anova analysis allowed us to confirm that there were statistically significant differences between the ievi values of the urban areas of cluster 2 and the other two clusters i e clusters 1 and 3 p value 0 05 in addition urban areas of cluster 2 are the most vulnerable ievi mean value of 0 030 followed by urban areas of cluster 1 ievi mean value of 0 008 and urban areas of cluster 3 ievi mean value of 0 026 4 discussion 4 1 strengths and limitations of data sources and methodology methodologies for assessing vulnerability and constructing indices vary greatly with data availability and accuracy and the analysis context felsenstein and lichter 2014 zachos et al 2016 flash floods usually take place in mountainous rivers affecting small urban areas marchi et al 2010 the statistical information available at this scale is often limited and difficult to obtain and update periodically gaume et al 2009 ruin et al 2009 which can sometimes cause that part of the information gathered is out of date and might not be representative e g variables related to the agricultural sector see table 1 this means that the selected analysis scale can sometimes be conditioned by data availability and it does not coincide with the appropriate scale for flood risk management barnett et al 2008 cutter et al 2013 which could result in an ineffective implementation of vulnerability reduction strategies mansur et al 2016 in addition the consideration of the analysis context i e the pre existing social economic and political conditions in vulnerability assessments is one of the major challenges for vulnerability researchers rufat et al 2015 numerous studies published to date include certain variables in their analysis only because they were considered in other papers see the abovementioned references however taking into account the analysis context should entail the adaptation of the selected variables to the local characteristics not considering the analysis context can lead to the initial exclusion of representative variables or conversely to the overrepresentation of weakly influential variables rufat et al 2015 analysis context should be considered in the variables selection stage of vulnerability assessments if a reliable representation of observed conditions is pursued holand and lujala 2013 thus variables selected here were considered to be representative of castilla y león characteristics taking into account the analysis context in which the study is developed the methodology most used in the construction of vulnerability indices employs the pca to extract vulnerability factors from a set of variables initially considered which are subsequently aggregated to generate indices cutter et al 2003 frazier et al 2014 de loyola hummell et al 2016 however the pca sample size requirement is rarely considered when formulating vulnerability indices and variables are often aggregated without any previous processing balteanu et al 2015 or very few variables are considered in the analysis rahman et al 2016 thus prior implementation of a hsa allows the pca sample size limitation to be overcome and therefore to develop a robust vulnerability index that can be applied to risk mitigation planning tate 2012 therefore the methodology proposed here can be replicated to urban areas with the same problem as it allows performing the pca without renouncing to include potentially interesting variables conversely the lack of scientific consensus on a general methodology for assessing vulnerability has resulted in high variability regarding how to address each of the stages of the vulnerability index development process tate 2012 and cartographic results de loyola hummell et al 2016 papathoma köhle 2016 aroca jimenez et al 2017 consequently it is very difficult to compare the results of vulnerability assessments from different study areas in fact index scores should only be used to qualitatively contrast if an urban area is more or less vulnerable than another cutter et al 2013 moreover the development of alternative methodologies for factor weighting represent a key research need rufat et al 2015 assuming that all vulnerability factors are equal in weight has been the most used approach thus far to establish vulnerability indices cutter et al 2003 chakraborty et al 2005 although some papers have already pointed out that not all factors have the same importance in the index construction eakin and luers 2006 liu and li 2016 use of context specific weights from expert opinion survey methods could be one path toward better weighting approaches however this scheme is considered to be a time consuming and costly process by other authors rufat et al 2015 thus the weighting methodology proposed here which is based on the tolerance statistic might be regarded as a suitable alternative in this context aroca jimenez et al 2017 conversely validation of vulnerability indices is a key aspect of vulnerability analysis the aim of the validation is to test the validity of a vulnerability index and it is usually addressed by using a supplementary data set of existing information about real extreme flood events e g property damages fatalities frequency of disaster declarations fekete 2009 bakkensen et al 2017 however and particularly in the case of flash flood events these data are not usually available so validation is difficult to address in this context it is also worth highlighting that a vulnerability index constitutes a snapshot view frazier et al 2014 although vulnerability varies spatially and temporally eakin and luers 2006 rufat et al 2015 vulnerability has a very high spatial variability so it is necessary to include the spatial patterns of vulnerability in the design of risk management plans in order to make optimal decisions koks et al 2015 identification of spatial patterns of economic vulnerability carried out here through the lcca is an improvement in this regard this approach could help the competent regional authorities to conduct more effective flood risk management aroca jimenez et al 2017 regarding the temporal context monitoring those variables originally included in vulnerability assessments would be necessary eakin and luers 2006 the above would inform decision makers about how index values vary over time ge et al 2013 and it would enhance our understanding of the interactions between vulnerability factors rufat et al 2015 4 2 integrated assessment and economic vulnerability patterns economic vulnerability is usually assessed in conjunction with social vulnerability cutter et al 2003 de loyola hummell et al 2016 although the number of variables related to the economic dimension is much lower than the number of social related variables especially in assessments carried out in urban areas prone to flash flooding balteanu et al 2015 terti et al 2015 karagiorgos et al 2016b 2016c vulnerability is mainly determined at community level by diversity of economic assets access to resources and relative distribution of income adger 1999 rufat et al 2015 which means that the causes of vulnerability are fundamentally related to the economic context nevertheless no publications have been found in international literature on assessing economic vulnerability by taking into account the context identifying economic vulnerabilities is even more important in urban areas affected by flash floods due to the fact that they are usually rural populations with low availability of services infrastructures and economic resources pelling 1999 vulnerability factors obtained here are considered to reflect the economic vulnerability of the region see table 2 moreover vulnerability factor mapping helped us to establish relationships between their spatial distribution and the economic characteristics of the region see fig 4 so exposure component is composed on the one hand of the factors urban environment and municipal infrastructures and facilities fig 4b 4e they are mainly related to the potential damages caused in flood prone areas e g potential cleaning up costs of the streets affected or potential repair costs of the education infrastructures or retirement homes affected the great majority of urban areas included here act as county seats i e urban areas with basic infrastructures and services which connect smaller areas that lack them therefore infrastructure damages or service interruptions could also affect those areas that depend on these county seats which would increase consequences on the other hand the potentially floodable dwellings factor is mainly related to the potential damages at individual level fig 4f affecting main houses with only one story above ground level which usually have the lowest floors located at ground level bodoque et al 2016b the above means that dwellers cannot move their belongings to a safer place e g to the second floor of their homes to reduce potential economic consequences regarding the sensitivity component it is related firstly to the economic capacity of urban areas to deal with flood consequences through the factors potential job losses and economic situation of municipalities fig 4a and d urban areas have major significance for the services sector especially in relation to trading and tourism in this context if tourist accommodation is damaged by flash flood events weis et al 2016 not only should repair costs be considered it could also lead to the temporary loss of profits both for owners and municipalities delgado et al 2012 the same can be stated regarding the interruption of trade flows furthermore these urban areas show high unemployment rates and high municipal debt levels so they have low individual and collective economic capacity for facing possible replacement costs caused by a flash flood event fekete 2009 frazier et al 2014 which would require external financial support in the recovery process fatemi et al 2017 secondly the factor vehicle fleet fig 4h reflects the wealth level of the urban areas weis et al 2016 urban areas with the highest values in this factor correspond to the most depopulated areas characterized by low population densities high dependency rates and almost without economic activity delgado et al 2012 aroca jimenez et al 2017 so they would also need external aid and financial support in emergency and recovery processes finally the resilience component is related on the one hand to citizens capacity to cope with flash flood consequences economic situation of households factor urban areas that have the highest values in this factor fig 4c correspond to the most developed areas where industry construction and services sectors predominate in contrast to those areas where agricultural activities predominate which correspond to least economically active areas delgado et al 2012 these areas have a high capacity to resist cope with and recuperate from flash flood events due to their economic capacity for implementing preventive measures at household levels de loyola hummell et al 2016 fatemi et al 2017 on the other hand urban areas with the highest values in the factor municipal investments fig 4g are in a good economic situation so they could allocate part of the municipal budget to the implementation of mitigation measures to reduce flash flood related losses and even to develop a system of financial aid in order to help the population to overcome floods economic consequences fekete 2009 koks et al 2015 integrated economic vulnerability analysis also enables us to know how exposure sensitivity and resilience interact and their relationships with ievi values fig 5 urban areas with the highest ievi scores show the highest values of exposure but there is no predominance of certain categories of sensitivity and resilience components the above is due to the fact that there is a great variability of combinations for the intermediate categories of the ievi values so it is difficult to distinguish economic vulnerability patterns finally urban areas with the lowest ievi values show the highest levels of resilience coinciding generally with the lowest values of exposure and sensitivity components thus integrated economic vulnerability assessment allows us to suggest more effective vulnerability reduction strategies focused on reducing exposure and sensitivity and on reinforcing resilience 4 3 implications for flood risk management and policy identification of spatial patterns of economic vulnerability was the main goal of the lcca fig 6 urban areas included in the same cluster share characteristics so it can help decision makers to develop more successful flood risk management strategies at regional level different vulnerability reduction strategies can be proposed for each cluster for example in cluster 1 vulnerability reduction should be targeted towards individual protection thus in response to an emergency dwellers should try to protect their assets at risk taking them to higher positions above floor level in cluster 2 vulnerability reduction should be focused on creating a municipal system of incentives to encourage inhabitants to carry out mitigation measures at the household level holand and lujala 2013 zhou et al 2014 finally in cluster 3 vulnerability reduction should be targeted towards building municipal economic support funds to help affected inhabitants after a flash flood event during the recovery phase schelfaut et al 2011 on the other hand considering that urban areas included in cluster 2 are the most vulnerable see section 3 2 could help decision makers to set priorities in allocating the available economic resources to vulnerability reduction which should be mainly intended for encouraging the population to protect themselves as stated above thus the ievi and the identification of spatial vulnerability patterns constitute a significant step towards improving flood risk management frazier et al 2014 papathoma köhle 2016 since they enable tailored flood risk mitigation strategies to be designed for each urban area koks et al 2015 however it is necessary to effectively communicate these improvements to the different stakeholders if integrated flood risk management is expected phillips and morrow 2007 kubal et al 2009 target groups should include decision makers emergency managers disaster responders and most importantly society kubal et al 2009 the above is even more important in those areas prone to flash flooding where the response time is shorter bodoque et al 2016a karagiorgos et al 2016c vulnerability analysis can help civil protection agencies to prioritize their actions in managing emergency situations and to help insurance companies to give the most vulnerable urban areas priority in evaluating economic damages in spain the insurance compensation consortium ccs acts as the central figure of the compensation system after the occurrence of extraordinary risks including flash floods the ccs covers damages to persons and direct material damages as well as the loss of profits arising from the direct damages provided that those affected have insurance policies previously contracted with private insurance companies without requiring the official declaration of catastrophe or disaster area as happens in other countries surminski et al 2015 regarding flood risk management in spain it is worth mentioning that after the period characterized by the development of extensive infrastructure to mitigate flood risk land use planning appeared to be a rational cost effective and sustainable alternative for reducing flood risk at regional and local level however during the real estate bubble 1995 2007 spain underwent a high increase of exposure to flood risk due to the indiscriminate occupation of flood prone areas pérez morales et al 2018 when many town councils received large amounts of money from building permissions without adequately controlling the suitability of lands for urbanization the transposition of the european floods directive into the spanish legislation in 2010 was a turning point in the situation described above as a result national and regional legislation on land use planning already require developing flood risk maps in order to determine if lands are adequate to be urbanized or not so flood risk maps have become an essential tool for land use planning also in spain despite in spain there is no specific legislation on adapting buildings or infrastructures to floods however there are some briefing i e nonbinding documents that provide a series of measures to protect and recover from a flood the methodological approaches contained in these documents could be implemented at local level e g the spanish civil protection plan the flood risk management plans or the guide for vulnerability reduction of buildings against floods integrated vulnerability assessments and therefore the resulting indices can also help the appropriate allocation of economic resources which are usually limited in urban areas affected by flash floods to vulnerability reduction rufat et al 2015 unisdr 2017 and to the spatial delimitation of catastrophe zones in order to assign properly the corresponding disaster financial compensations by the public administration in addition risk reduction should be a key aspect of local development which could contribute to the revitalization of the local economy liao 2012 unisdr 2017 this point is very important in the context of castilla y león because there are many urban areas that have significant problems equipping themselves with the necessary facilities and providing basic services to the local population delgado et al 2012 which increase vulnerability rufat et al 2015 social perception and awareness determine the effectiveness of flood risk mitigation and emergency plans since they enable suitable risk communication and education plans to be devised to improve community resilience micu et al 2015 bodoque et al 2016a comprehensive flood risk management requires in addition to an integrated vulnerability analysis the drawing up of risk communication plans to inform the population about how they should proceed or how they should not when facing a flash flood event finally the participation of the population in the formulation of vulnerability reduction strategies not only reduces the possible economic damages caused by a flash flood but also increases the efficiency of flood risk management plans and enables the communities to be empowered and gain ownership unisdr 2017 which would result in an increase in community resilience 5 conclusions obtaining a truly reliable ievi requires the implementation of a robust methodology for its construction however in geographical contexts where available information is limited as usually occurs in urban areas prone to flash flooding the appropriate ratio between the number of urban areas considered and the number of variables to perform the pca is rarely taken into account application of the has previously to applying pca allows this limitation to be addressed and represents an alternative to the methodology usually used to construct vulnerability indices in these areas meanwhile the integrated vulnerability analysis allows the direction and intensity of the interactions between the different vulnerability components and between these and index scores to be ascertained the results obtained here show major complexity in these interactions and a high spatial variability of ievi values this highlights the importance of conducting integrated assessments the ievi enables the vulnerability component that should be enhanced or strengthened for each urban area to be identified this can help competent authorities to suggest more effective vulnerability reduction strategies the identification of spatial patterns by means of the lcca enables the design of more appropriate vulnerability reduction strategies for each of the differentiated clusters of urban areas which would also help to allocate economic resources more efficiently and therefore to improve frm policies and plans at the regional scale in addition the results of the lcca allows the spatial information to be synthesized into a single map this can be a very useful tool to connect the vulnerability analysis with decision

7011,economic losses caused by flash floods are expected to rise worldwide in the coming decades which is largely due to the increasing exposure of elements at risk therefore a comprehensive analysis of the economic context of the potentially affected areas is highly recommendable numerous papers have been published to date that focus on quantifying vulnerability in general and in areas affected by floods in particular however the number of studies devoted to flash flood prone areas is far lower integrated economic vulnerability assessment enables one to learn what characteristics explain trigger intensify and attenuate the exposure sensitivity and resilience of economically vulnerable populations which can be combined to achieve an integrated economic vulnerability index ievi the methodology deployed here was conducted in castilla y león northwest spain 94 223 km2 and has allowed the economic vulnerability of urban areas to be analyzed which has been primarily addressed by the estimation of economic losses or more recently including a few economic variables within social vulnerability assessments thus 118 economic variables were initially gathered and then divided into groups through a hierarchical segmentation analysis subsequently variables were combined employing a principal components analysis giving rise to the economic vulnerability factors that were subsequently aggregated to construct the ievi tolerance statistic was used as a weighting method to define the ievi whereas quintiles were chosen as a statistical criterion to map economic vulnerability as a final step latent class cluster analysis was implemented to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability our findings show that ievi scores have a high spatial variability and a high degree of complexity in the relationships among different vulnerability factors moreover they help to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability which makes the design of suitable vulnerability reduction strategies possible thereby improving the efficiency of flood risk management plans and policies keywords economic vulnerability vulnerability index flash flood risk management spatial patterns latent class cluster analysis 1 introduction over recent decades population growth inappropriate land use planning environmental degradation and increases in wealth together with the effects of global climate change have been found to be the leading causes of the increasing losses caused by the impact of natural hazards van der veen and logtmeijer 2005 mechler and bouwer 2015 regarding mountainous areas the increase in the number of flood events and associated losses are primarily due to i the increasing exposure of elements at risk fuchs et al 2015 ii natural flood frequency fluctuations schmocker fackel and naef 2010 and iii the effects of climate change huggel et al 2012 flash floods are considered to be one of the natural hazards with the highest capacity to generate risk i e the potential loss of life harm or damaged assets which could occur to a society as a result of a natural hazard event determined by combining hazard exposure and vulnerability unisdr 2016 regarding both the socio economic and human impact on a global scale barredo 2007 marchi et al 2010 borga 2013 terti et al 2015 the above is mainly due to the fact that flash flood events happen very quickly which significantly reduces the warning and response times of the population and relevant civil protection agencies creutin et al 2009 borga 2013 bodoque et al 2015 despite the efforts of practitioners decision makers stakeholders and public administrations over the last decades to reduce the effects of flash floods the number of events and associated economic and human lives losses are still increasing all over the world birkmann et al 2013 munich re 2017 this trend highlights the need to continue improving disaster risk reduction strategies traditional strategies for reducing disaster risk opt for total control and protection against flood risk which mainly involves the design and the implementation of structural mitigation measures e g deflection and retention facilities check dams levees holub and fuchs 2009 such structures are particularly difficult to maintain in mountainous regions due to the limited availability of financial resources which determines structural protection is usually accompanied by land use planning and other legal regulations e g building codes mandatory insurances risk mapping tompkins et al 2012 unisdr 2015 papathoma köhle and thaler 2018 and local structural protection mainly through an adapted construction design of elements at risk holub and hübl 2008 holub and fuchs 2009 since it is not possible to guarantee complete safety risk management is currently directed toward recognizing risk and making people aware of and prepared to live with risk birkmann et al 2013 borga 2013 the united nations has been working along these lines since the adoption of the international strategy for disaster reduction 1990 1999 and the subsequent publication of the different frameworks i e the hyogo framework for action in force until 2015 and the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction to be developed during the period 2015 2030 their primary objective is the construction of societies that are more resilient vis a vis the effects of natural hazards in order to reduce human economic and social losses unisdr 2015 to this end the development of a system of indicators of disaster risk and vulnerability is viewed as a critical requirement this approach could help decision makers to assess the potential impact of natural hazards it could also promote the formulation of appropriate policy responses and identify the most vulnerable social groups and areas eakin and luers 2006 birkmann et al 2013 allowing flood risk analysis and management to be improved frazier et al 2014 papathoma köhle 2016 numerous papers focusing on vulnerability have been published in the field of natural hazards birkmann et al 2013 martín et al 2017 wen et al 2017 regarding flash floods approaches followed so far have mainly focused on the physical dimension kappes et al 2012 zelenáková et al 2015 karagiorgos et al 2016c papathoma köhle 2016 and to a lesser extent on the social dimension of vulnerability balteanu et al 2015 aroca jimenez et al 2017 mahmood et al 2017 many flood vulnerability studies have been carried out in large settlements located close to big drainage basins of major rivers with response times of hours or even days e g elbe danube and rhine basins fekete 2009 or south atlantic division usa cutter et al 2013 this is quite a different problem than the one found at small watersheds where flash floods take place however to date research devoted to characterizing economic vulnerability due to flash floods has been scarce the characterization of this vulnerability dimension could help local decision makers to efficiently manage the available economic resources to deal with flood risk which can be limited at flash flood prone areas few 2003 mcdowell and hess 2012 khazai et al 2013 as regards the above the economic dimension of vulnerability has been mainly addressed through damage estimations i e evaluating replacement economic costs fuchs 2009 karagiorgos et al 2016a which does not necessarily reflect the economic vulnerability of a system khazai et al 2013 other authors such as van der veen and logtmeijer 2005 evaluated the economic vulnerability of a flood prone area in the netherlands through the assessment of the indirect economic costs resulting from a levee failure however as stated above economic costs estimations cannot correctly reflect the economic vulnerability of a place assessing vulnerability usually consists of the construction of vulnerability indices representing the inherent characteristics or qualities of social systems that create the potential for harm i e pre event or pre existing vulnerability cutter et al 2003 2008 de loyola hummell et al 2016 as well as considering the static nature of society i e without taking account of daily mobility or activity of people terti et al 2015 in this regard it is a common practice to include some economic variables in social vulnerability analysis cutter et al 2003 fekete 2009 frazier et al 2014 nevertheless the number of economic variables that are usually included is remarkably reduced so there can be some aspects of the economic dimension of vulnerability that are not considered including among them information related to the different economic sectors or utilities balteanu et al 2015 rahman et al 2016 debortoli et al 2017 the united nations office for disaster risk reduction unisdr defines vulnerability as the conditions determined by physical social economic and environmental factors or processes which increase the susceptibility of an individual a community assets or systems to the impacts of hazards unisdr 2016 vulnerability is a function of exposure i e the proximity of people and societal assets to the hazard sensitivity i e the level of impact the hazard has on people and societal assets and resilience i e the ability of a community and societal assets to resist absorb accommodate adapt to transform and recover from the effects of the hazard turner et al 2003 adger 2006 füssel 2007 therefore vulnerability analysis should consider all the vulnerability dimensions i e social economic physical institutional cultural and environmental and components i e exposure sensitivity and resilience to assess vulnerability holistically karagiorgos et al 2016b papathoma köhle 2016 numerous papers have been published in which only sensitivity is evaluated cutter et al 2003 nelson et al 2015 de loyola hummell et al 2016 or resilience cutter et al 2010 siebeneck et al 2015 qasim et al 2016 nevertheless the use of the integrated approach to assess vulnerability is becoming more frequent i e including all the vulnerability components in vulnerability assessment and analyzing their interactions frazier et al 2014 terti et al 2015 aroca jimenez et al 2017 lian et al 2017 which provides a holistic view of vulnerability conversely multi dimensional vulnerability assessments proposed thus far are only theoretical approaches that recommend key variables of the different vulnerability dimensions which could serve as a basis for a future methodology but they do not suggest a practical analysis method fuchs 2009 menoni et al 2012 birkmann et al 2013 thus the objective of this paper is to construct a new economic vulnerability index in urban areas prone to flash flooding using an integrated approach to assessment to do that a set of economic variables were gathered and subsequently analyzed to construct the integrated economic vulnerability index ievi this analysis was based on applying a sequential statistical multivariate methodology which included i hierarchical segmentation analysis hsa to overcome the principal components analysis pca sample size limitation ii pca to extract the vulnerability factors and iii latent class cluster analysis lcca to identify economic vulnerability patterns within the urban areas which helped us to suggest specific mitigation measures for each cluster 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the proposed methodology has been tested in the region of castilla y león which is an autonomous region of spain 94 226 km2 representing almost 20 of the country s territory and one of the largest in europe fig 1 it is located between latitudes 40 05 and 43 14 n and longitudes 1 46 and 7 05 w its relief is primarily composed of a set of high altitude plains called meseta around 800 900 m a s l bordered by large mountain ranges around 2 000 m a s l the relief produces a predominantly mediterranean climate with some continental features the above results in significant thermal and rainfall gradients from the plains to the mountain systems i e from 10 to 2 c for temperatures and from 550 to 1 800 mm for rainfall regarding socioeconomic characteristics castilla y león has a population of more than 2 5 million it is administratively divided into 2 248 urban areas of which more than 84 have a population density of 20 inhabitants per square kilometer the rural depopulation that characterizes the region is a factor in the inability of an extraordinary number of mountainous urban areas to maintain resources and provide public services or the need to cope with high costs to do so martínez and delgado 2013 on the other hand the labor dependence ratio in these areas is 0 79 i e there are 79 dependents per 100 persons of working age the ageing population the livestock and agricultural sectors crisis and the existing obstacles to generating new economic initiatives result in extremely limited economic dynamism in these urban areas which highlights the need to properly manage the available economic resources molina 2012 2 2 database construction identification of urban areas of interest and selection of economic variables the first step in implementing the general methodology fig 2 was to identify those urban areas that could be affected by flash floods a set of restrictive conditions were implemented for this purpose using arcgis v10 1 software on the one hand the urban areas that were crossed by rivers with a longitudinal slope higher than 0 01 m m 1 were discriminated bodoque et al 2015 to apply this requirement a digital terrain model with a cell size of 200 200 m provided by the spanish national geographic institute ign http centrodedescargas cnig es was employed to compute river slopes using the geospatial hydrologic modeling extension hec geohms http www hec usace army mil software hec geohms meanwhile the urban areas that were identified as areas with potential significant flood risk apsfrs and the hazard areas with low or exceptional probability of flooding return period of 500 years were selected this cartography was provided by the spanish ministry of agriculture and fisheries food and environment mapama http www mapama gob es es cartografia y sig ide descargas agua default aspx and they derive from directive 2007 60 ce regarding flood risk assessment and management as a result 39 urban areas met the above mentioned specifications for which the economic database was created in light of existing literature and considering the economic context of the region cutter et al 2003 merz et al 2010 molinari et al 2014 weis et al 2016 mahmood et al 2017 a set of 118 economic variables were initially described for each of the 39 urban territories recognized previously most variables were taken directly from public databases e g variables related to unemployment by economic sectors or related to dwellings characteristics or maintenance or estimated from geographic information e g variables related to lifelines and infrastructures such as bridges or sewage treatment plants some of them were calculated on the basis of data from public organizations e g unemployment rate or per capita income variables were subsequently standardized and a bivariate correlation test was performed to discard redundant variables i e variables with an absolute correlation coefficient above 0 9 mooi and sarstedt 2014 finally 31 variables were employed in the statistical analysis table 1 see also supplementary data and these were classified into 5 thematic groups i employment and municipal economic situation 7 variables related to the employment situation and economic indicators ii private housing and fleet 11 variables associated with the housing typology and conservation status and vehicles iii public sector 4 variables linked to public facilities iv municipal infrastructures 7 variables related to municipal facilities and infrastructures and v agricultural sector 2 variables linked to the agricultural sector which is a key factor in the economy of castilla y león 2 3 exploratory analysis of variables the statistical analysis of variables involved two steps see fig 2 which were conducted using spss ibm spss statistics v 19 it is not recommended to perform a pca when the number of urban areas of interest is not at least three times higher than the number of variables maccallum et al 1999 therefore it was necessary to previously implement a hierarchical segmentation analysis hsa to overcome this pca sample size limitation 2 3 1 segmentation of variables into groups hsa is a multivariate statistical technique with the goal of dividing a set of variables into groups mooi and sarstedt 2014 whereas a variable in a particular group should be as similar as possible to all the other variables in the same group it should likewise be as distinct as possible from variables of different groups the similarity is calculated by estimating the distance between pairs of variables variables with smaller distances between one another are more similar and variables with larger distances are more dissimilar the squared euclidean distance was used here as the distance measure i e the sum of the squared differences between variable values mooi and sarstedt 2014 on the other hand ward s method was used as a grouping method which seeks to minimize the within group variance mooi and sarstedt 2014 this method uses agglomerative hierarchical algorithms these algorithms follow a hierarchical process where initially each variable represents an individual group and they are then sequentially merged according to their similarity this method is considered to be one of the most effective especially when the sample size is small martín et al 2015 the graphical output of the hsa i e dendrogram was used to decide the optimal number of groups in which variables were going to be divided 2 3 2 identification of economic vulnerability factors once variables were divided into groups a pca was performed in each of them pca allows the number of variables initially considered to be summarized through the linear combination thereof they are called principal components or factors and explain most of the variance embedded in the original variables the kaiser meyer olkin kmo statistic and the bartlett s test of sphericity were used to test whether the variables considered were appropriate for performing the pca i e kmo 0 6 and p value 0 05 respectively mooi and sarstedt 2014 pca uses correlation matrix between variables to extract the factors variables that comprise one factor have a certain amount of correlation while factors are uncorrelated and they cover distinct and unrelated aspects mooi and sarstedt 2014 factor loadings show the correlation between factors and variables high factor loadings indicate that a variable is well represented by a specific factor on the other hand communality assesses how much of each variable variance is captured by the factors extracted variables with communality values below 0 5 were eliminated from the analysis and the process was replicated finally a least squares regression method was used to calculate factor scores mooi and sarstedt 2014 which were employed to construct the ievi 2 4 construction of the integrated economic vulnerability index ievi factor scores were standardized to a mean of zero and they took values above or below zero depending on whether urban areas exhibited the characteristics described by a factor above or below the average mooi and sarstedt 2014 traditionally factors that increase vulnerability i e factors associated to exposure and sensitivity component are introduced into indices as positive values while factors that decrease vulnerability i e factors related to resilience component are introduced as negative values frazier et al 2014 de loyola hummell et al 2016 based on the above we turned around the sign of some factor scores by multiplying them by 1 finally ievi was calculated using the eq 1 adapted from frazier et al 2014 1 ievi e s r where ievi is the integrated economic vulnerability index e is exposure s is sensitivity and r is resilience each vulnerability component was estimated according to the eq 2 adapted from frazier et al 2014 2 v c f 1 n w f p f where v c is a vulnerability component exposure sensitivity or resilience w f is the weight assigned to the f factor and p f is the factor score of the f factor for instance if a vulnerability component is comprised of three factors n 3 its value corresponds to the sum of the three factor scores multiplied by their respective weights the weighting method was based here on the tolerance statistic which is a statistical test used in regression analysis to detect collinearity mooi and sarstedt 2014 thus those vulnerability factors that were less correlated with the others had a higher weight allocated in the ievi 2 5 recognition of spatial economic vulnerability patterns latent class cluster analysis lcca was implemented using the software latent gold 4 5 it is a statistical modeling technique which was performed with the aim of pinpointing economic vulnerability patterns within the study region lcca enabled us to identify unobserved heterogeneity by dividing the urban areas of interest into clusters to do this a categorical latent variable was created which indicated the cluster to which each urban area belonged to vermunt and magidson 2002 the cluster was determined by estimating the probability of belonging to a specific cluster according to the features of the vulnerability factors five models were assessed one no sample heterogeneity to five clusters sample heterogeneity with five patterns being considered the optimal number of clusters was determined by the minimum values of the bayesian information criterion bic and the consistent akaike s information criterion caic vermunt and magidson 2002 finally the model profile i e the marginal distribution of values of each vulnerability factor within each cluster haughton et al 2009 associated with the optimal model enabled us to ascertain the economic vulnerability sources for each cluster identified 3 results 3 1 integrated economic vulnerability index ievi and vulnerability mapping the results obtained in the hsa are displayed in the dendrogram fig 3 economic variables were divided into five groups after approximately nine iterations of the hierarchical algorithms these groups contained from 3 to 9 variables although the groups were not homogeneous in terms of the number of variables they were coherent regarding the meaning of variables included thus the first group contained variables related to the potential damage to municipal facilities and the labor system the second group was associated with the individual economic situation and the potential damage to houses the third group contained variables concerning the potential damage to municipal infrastructures and utilities the fourth group was composed of variables related to housing type and state of conservation finally the fifth group was made up of municipal economic indicators performing a pca in each of the five groups identified by the hsa resulted in the extraction of 8 vulnerability factors 1 potential job losses 2 urban environment 3 economic situation of households 4 economic situation of municipalities 5 municipal infrastructures and facilities 6 potentially floodable dwellings 7 municipal investments 8 vehicle fleet factor names were assigned considering the variable loadings within each vulnerability factor which also allowed them to be categorized by vulnerability component thus exposure component was made up of factors 2 5 and 6 sensitivity component included factors 1 4 and 8 and resilience component was comprised of factors 3 and 7 the percentage of explained variance was above 50 in all vulnerability factors in addition kmo statistics were higher than 0 6 and bartlett s tests of sphericity values were statistically significant p value 0 05 correlation coefficients were shown instead of kmo values in those cases in which vulnerability factors were formed by two variables whose coefficients were also statistically significant p 0 05 table 2 factor scores associated with each vulnerability factor were mapped using the quintiles classification method i e 20th 40th 60th and 80th percentiles five classes were established i very high ii high iii medium iv low and v very low fig 4 for exposure and sensitivity factors red was the color used for the very high category and blue for the very low category however colors were reversed for resilience factors to facilitate understanding of the map using blue for the very high category and red for the very low fig 5 shows the relationships between the ievi values and their vulnerability components i e exposure sensitivity and resilience urban areas were colored according to the ievi values using the quintiles classification method described above in this case red corresponds to very high category i e very high vulnerability while blue corresponds to very low category i e very low vulnerability ievi defines values that range from 0 108 to 0 107 the urban areas with the highest ievi values being located in the west of the region león province see fig 1 and the lowest values in the east soria province see fig 1 on the other hand ievi values were decomposed into the values of the different vulnerability components which were represented using bar charts bar heights depend on the vulnerability component values and bar colors indicate the categories in which the vulnerability component values are found according to the quintiles classification method moreover bar directions indicate the vulnerability component signs which depend on whether vulnerability component values are above component average i e positive values or below component average i e negative values 3 2 spatial economic vulnerability patterns the minimum values of bic and caic determined that the optimal model was the one which considered three clusters of urban areas table 3 the above means that although we would increase the disaggregation level of clusters i e considering the model with four or five clusters of urban areas and thus the number of estimated parameters it would not significantly raise the information explained by the model the parameters associated to the selected model show that potential job losses and municipal investments factors were not statistically significant in dividing urban areas into clusters p value 0 05 so they were not considered in clusters segregation table 4 finally spatial patterns were extracted from the model profile fig 6 shows on the one hand the cluster to which each urban area belongs on the other hand the representative urban area of each cluster has an associated bar chart that depicts the profile of each recognized pattern the representative urban areas were calculated considering the number of matches between the sign of the vulnerability factors values associated to each urban area and the sign of the vulnerability factors values associated to each cluster bar values correspond to the standard deviations from the means for each vulnerability factor of each cluster moreover bar directions reveal the sign of the standard deviation values which can be positive i e higher exposure sensitivity or resilience than cluster mean values or negative i e lesser exposure sensitivity and resilience than cluster mean values thus clusters present the following characteristics cluster 1 includes 63 1 of urban areas a total of 25 and it is characterized by containing urban areas with the highest values of potentially floodable dwellings exposure factor and the lowest values of urban environment and municipal infrastructures and facilities exposure factors cluster 2 comprises 25 9 of urban areas a total of 10 and it is made up of urban areas with the highest values of urban environment and municipal infrastructures and facilities exposure factors in addition urban areas with the highest values of potentially floodable dwellings exposure factor are also found in this cluster i e standard deviation values of the potentially floodable dwellings factor of clusters 1 and 2 are very similar regarding sensitivity component this cluster contains urban areas with the highest values of economic situation of municipalities factor and the lowest values of vehicle fleet factor on the other hand this cluster presents urban areas with the highest values of economic situation of households resilience factor cluster 3 includes 11 1 of urban areas a total of 4 and it contains urban areas with the lowest values of potentially floodable dwellings exposure factor regarding sensitivity component this cluster is made up of urban areas with the highest values of vehicle fleet factor and the lowest values of economic situation of municipalities factor regarding resilience component urban areas with the lowest values of economic situation of households factor are found here according to the results described above it appears that ievi values are related to the clusters of urban areas in this regard an analysis of variance anova analysis allowed us to confirm that there were statistically significant differences between the ievi values of the urban areas of cluster 2 and the other two clusters i e clusters 1 and 3 p value 0 05 in addition urban areas of cluster 2 are the most vulnerable ievi mean value of 0 030 followed by urban areas of cluster 1 ievi mean value of 0 008 and urban areas of cluster 3 ievi mean value of 0 026 4 discussion 4 1 strengths and limitations of data sources and methodology methodologies for assessing vulnerability and constructing indices vary greatly with data availability and accuracy and the analysis context felsenstein and lichter 2014 zachos et al 2016 flash floods usually take place in mountainous rivers affecting small urban areas marchi et al 2010 the statistical information available at this scale is often limited and difficult to obtain and update periodically gaume et al 2009 ruin et al 2009 which can sometimes cause that part of the information gathered is out of date and might not be representative e g variables related to the agricultural sector see table 1 this means that the selected analysis scale can sometimes be conditioned by data availability and it does not coincide with the appropriate scale for flood risk management barnett et al 2008 cutter et al 2013 which could result in an ineffective implementation of vulnerability reduction strategies mansur et al 2016 in addition the consideration of the analysis context i e the pre existing social economic and political conditions in vulnerability assessments is one of the major challenges for vulnerability researchers rufat et al 2015 numerous studies published to date include certain variables in their analysis only because they were considered in other papers see the abovementioned references however taking into account the analysis context should entail the adaptation of the selected variables to the local characteristics not considering the analysis context can lead to the initial exclusion of representative variables or conversely to the overrepresentation of weakly influential variables rufat et al 2015 analysis context should be considered in the variables selection stage of vulnerability assessments if a reliable representation of observed conditions is pursued holand and lujala 2013 thus variables selected here were considered to be representative of castilla y león characteristics taking into account the analysis context in which the study is developed the methodology most used in the construction of vulnerability indices employs the pca to extract vulnerability factors from a set of variables initially considered which are subsequently aggregated to generate indices cutter et al 2003 frazier et al 2014 de loyola hummell et al 2016 however the pca sample size requirement is rarely considered when formulating vulnerability indices and variables are often aggregated without any previous processing balteanu et al 2015 or very few variables are considered in the analysis rahman et al 2016 thus prior implementation of a hsa allows the pca sample size limitation to be overcome and therefore to develop a robust vulnerability index that can be applied to risk mitigation planning tate 2012 therefore the methodology proposed here can be replicated to urban areas with the same problem as it allows performing the pca without renouncing to include potentially interesting variables conversely the lack of scientific consensus on a general methodology for assessing vulnerability has resulted in high variability regarding how to address each of the stages of the vulnerability index development process tate 2012 and cartographic results de loyola hummell et al 2016 papathoma köhle 2016 aroca jimenez et al 2017 consequently it is very difficult to compare the results of vulnerability assessments from different study areas in fact index scores should only be used to qualitatively contrast if an urban area is more or less vulnerable than another cutter et al 2013 moreover the development of alternative methodologies for factor weighting represent a key research need rufat et al 2015 assuming that all vulnerability factors are equal in weight has been the most used approach thus far to establish vulnerability indices cutter et al 2003 chakraborty et al 2005 although some papers have already pointed out that not all factors have the same importance in the index construction eakin and luers 2006 liu and li 2016 use of context specific weights from expert opinion survey methods could be one path toward better weighting approaches however this scheme is considered to be a time consuming and costly process by other authors rufat et al 2015 thus the weighting methodology proposed here which is based on the tolerance statistic might be regarded as a suitable alternative in this context aroca jimenez et al 2017 conversely validation of vulnerability indices is a key aspect of vulnerability analysis the aim of the validation is to test the validity of a vulnerability index and it is usually addressed by using a supplementary data set of existing information about real extreme flood events e g property damages fatalities frequency of disaster declarations fekete 2009 bakkensen et al 2017 however and particularly in the case of flash flood events these data are not usually available so validation is difficult to address in this context it is also worth highlighting that a vulnerability index constitutes a snapshot view frazier et al 2014 although vulnerability varies spatially and temporally eakin and luers 2006 rufat et al 2015 vulnerability has a very high spatial variability so it is necessary to include the spatial patterns of vulnerability in the design of risk management plans in order to make optimal decisions koks et al 2015 identification of spatial patterns of economic vulnerability carried out here through the lcca is an improvement in this regard this approach could help the competent regional authorities to conduct more effective flood risk management aroca jimenez et al 2017 regarding the temporal context monitoring those variables originally included in vulnerability assessments would be necessary eakin and luers 2006 the above would inform decision makers about how index values vary over time ge et al 2013 and it would enhance our understanding of the interactions between vulnerability factors rufat et al 2015 4 2 integrated assessment and economic vulnerability patterns economic vulnerability is usually assessed in conjunction with social vulnerability cutter et al 2003 de loyola hummell et al 2016 although the number of variables related to the economic dimension is much lower than the number of social related variables especially in assessments carried out in urban areas prone to flash flooding balteanu et al 2015 terti et al 2015 karagiorgos et al 2016b 2016c vulnerability is mainly determined at community level by diversity of economic assets access to resources and relative distribution of income adger 1999 rufat et al 2015 which means that the causes of vulnerability are fundamentally related to the economic context nevertheless no publications have been found in international literature on assessing economic vulnerability by taking into account the context identifying economic vulnerabilities is even more important in urban areas affected by flash floods due to the fact that they are usually rural populations with low availability of services infrastructures and economic resources pelling 1999 vulnerability factors obtained here are considered to reflect the economic vulnerability of the region see table 2 moreover vulnerability factor mapping helped us to establish relationships between their spatial distribution and the economic characteristics of the region see fig 4 so exposure component is composed on the one hand of the factors urban environment and municipal infrastructures and facilities fig 4b 4e they are mainly related to the potential damages caused in flood prone areas e g potential cleaning up costs of the streets affected or potential repair costs of the education infrastructures or retirement homes affected the great majority of urban areas included here act as county seats i e urban areas with basic infrastructures and services which connect smaller areas that lack them therefore infrastructure damages or service interruptions could also affect those areas that depend on these county seats which would increase consequences on the other hand the potentially floodable dwellings factor is mainly related to the potential damages at individual level fig 4f affecting main houses with only one story above ground level which usually have the lowest floors located at ground level bodoque et al 2016b the above means that dwellers cannot move their belongings to a safer place e g to the second floor of their homes to reduce potential economic consequences regarding the sensitivity component it is related firstly to the economic capacity of urban areas to deal with flood consequences through the factors potential job losses and economic situation of municipalities fig 4a and d urban areas have major significance for the services sector especially in relation to trading and tourism in this context if tourist accommodation is damaged by flash flood events weis et al 2016 not only should repair costs be considered it could also lead to the temporary loss of profits both for owners and municipalities delgado et al 2012 the same can be stated regarding the interruption of trade flows furthermore these urban areas show high unemployment rates and high municipal debt levels so they have low individual and collective economic capacity for facing possible replacement costs caused by a flash flood event fekete 2009 frazier et al 2014 which would require external financial support in the recovery process fatemi et al 2017 secondly the factor vehicle fleet fig 4h reflects the wealth level of the urban areas weis et al 2016 urban areas with the highest values in this factor correspond to the most depopulated areas characterized by low population densities high dependency rates and almost without economic activity delgado et al 2012 aroca jimenez et al 2017 so they would also need external aid and financial support in emergency and recovery processes finally the resilience component is related on the one hand to citizens capacity to cope with flash flood consequences economic situation of households factor urban areas that have the highest values in this factor fig 4c correspond to the most developed areas where industry construction and services sectors predominate in contrast to those areas where agricultural activities predominate which correspond to least economically active areas delgado et al 2012 these areas have a high capacity to resist cope with and recuperate from flash flood events due to their economic capacity for implementing preventive measures at household levels de loyola hummell et al 2016 fatemi et al 2017 on the other hand urban areas with the highest values in the factor municipal investments fig 4g are in a good economic situation so they could allocate part of the municipal budget to the implementation of mitigation measures to reduce flash flood related losses and even to develop a system of financial aid in order to help the population to overcome floods economic consequences fekete 2009 koks et al 2015 integrated economic vulnerability analysis also enables us to know how exposure sensitivity and resilience interact and their relationships with ievi values fig 5 urban areas with the highest ievi scores show the highest values of exposure but there is no predominance of certain categories of sensitivity and resilience components the above is due to the fact that there is a great variability of combinations for the intermediate categories of the ievi values so it is difficult to distinguish economic vulnerability patterns finally urban areas with the lowest ievi values show the highest levels of resilience coinciding generally with the lowest values of exposure and sensitivity components thus integrated economic vulnerability assessment allows us to suggest more effective vulnerability reduction strategies focused on reducing exposure and sensitivity and on reinforcing resilience 4 3 implications for flood risk management and policy identification of spatial patterns of economic vulnerability was the main goal of the lcca fig 6 urban areas included in the same cluster share characteristics so it can help decision makers to develop more successful flood risk management strategies at regional level different vulnerability reduction strategies can be proposed for each cluster for example in cluster 1 vulnerability reduction should be targeted towards individual protection thus in response to an emergency dwellers should try to protect their assets at risk taking them to higher positions above floor level in cluster 2 vulnerability reduction should be focused on creating a municipal system of incentives to encourage inhabitants to carry out mitigation measures at the household level holand and lujala 2013 zhou et al 2014 finally in cluster 3 vulnerability reduction should be targeted towards building municipal economic support funds to help affected inhabitants after a flash flood event during the recovery phase schelfaut et al 2011 on the other hand considering that urban areas included in cluster 2 are the most vulnerable see section 3 2 could help decision makers to set priorities in allocating the available economic resources to vulnerability reduction which should be mainly intended for encouraging the population to protect themselves as stated above thus the ievi and the identification of spatial vulnerability patterns constitute a significant step towards improving flood risk management frazier et al 2014 papathoma köhle 2016 since they enable tailored flood risk mitigation strategies to be designed for each urban area koks et al 2015 however it is necessary to effectively communicate these improvements to the different stakeholders if integrated flood risk management is expected phillips and morrow 2007 kubal et al 2009 target groups should include decision makers emergency managers disaster responders and most importantly society kubal et al 2009 the above is even more important in those areas prone to flash flooding where the response time is shorter bodoque et al 2016a karagiorgos et al 2016c vulnerability analysis can help civil protection agencies to prioritize their actions in managing emergency situations and to help insurance companies to give the most vulnerable urban areas priority in evaluating economic damages in spain the insurance compensation consortium ccs acts as the central figure of the compensation system after the occurrence of extraordinary risks including flash floods the ccs covers damages to persons and direct material damages as well as the loss of profits arising from the direct damages provided that those affected have insurance policies previously contracted with private insurance companies without requiring the official declaration of catastrophe or disaster area as happens in other countries surminski et al 2015 regarding flood risk management in spain it is worth mentioning that after the period characterized by the development of extensive infrastructure to mitigate flood risk land use planning appeared to be a rational cost effective and sustainable alternative for reducing flood risk at regional and local level however during the real estate bubble 1995 2007 spain underwent a high increase of exposure to flood risk due to the indiscriminate occupation of flood prone areas pérez morales et al 2018 when many town councils received large amounts of money from building permissions without adequately controlling the suitability of lands for urbanization the transposition of the european floods directive into the spanish legislation in 2010 was a turning point in the situation described above as a result national and regional legislation on land use planning already require developing flood risk maps in order to determine if lands are adequate to be urbanized or not so flood risk maps have become an essential tool for land use planning also in spain despite in spain there is no specific legislation on adapting buildings or infrastructures to floods however there are some briefing i e nonbinding documents that provide a series of measures to protect and recover from a flood the methodological approaches contained in these documents could be implemented at local level e g the spanish civil protection plan the flood risk management plans or the guide for vulnerability reduction of buildings against floods integrated vulnerability assessments and therefore the resulting indices can also help the appropriate allocation of economic resources which are usually limited in urban areas affected by flash floods to vulnerability reduction rufat et al 2015 unisdr 2017 and to the spatial delimitation of catastrophe zones in order to assign properly the corresponding disaster financial compensations by the public administration in addition risk reduction should be a key aspect of local development which could contribute to the revitalization of the local economy liao 2012 unisdr 2017 this point is very important in the context of castilla y león because there are many urban areas that have significant problems equipping themselves with the necessary facilities and providing basic services to the local population delgado et al 2012 which increase vulnerability rufat et al 2015 social perception and awareness determine the effectiveness of flood risk mitigation and emergency plans since they enable suitable risk communication and education plans to be devised to improve community resilience micu et al 2015 bodoque et al 2016a comprehensive flood risk management requires in addition to an integrated vulnerability analysis the drawing up of risk communication plans to inform the population about how they should proceed or how they should not when facing a flash flood event finally the participation of the population in the formulation of vulnerability reduction strategies not only reduces the possible economic damages caused by a flash flood but also increases the efficiency of flood risk management plans and enables the communities to be empowered and gain ownership unisdr 2017 which would result in an increase in community resilience 5 conclusions obtaining a truly reliable ievi requires the implementation of a robust methodology for its construction however in geographical contexts where available information is limited as usually occurs in urban areas prone to flash flooding the appropriate ratio between the number of urban areas considered and the number of variables to perform the pca is rarely taken into account application of the has previously to applying pca allows this limitation to be addressed and represents an alternative to the methodology usually used to construct vulnerability indices in these areas meanwhile the integrated vulnerability analysis allows the direction and intensity of the interactions between the different vulnerability components and between these and index scores to be ascertained the results obtained here show major complexity in these interactions and a high spatial variability of ievi values this highlights the importance of conducting integrated assessments the ievi enables the vulnerability component that should be enhanced or strengthened for each urban area to be identified this can help competent authorities to suggest more effective vulnerability reduction strategies the identification of spatial patterns by means of the lcca enables the design of more appropriate vulnerability reduction strategies for each of the differentiated clusters of urban areas which would also help to allocate economic resources more efficiently and therefore to improve frm policies and plans at the regional scale in addition the results of the lcca allows the spatial information to be synthesized into a single map this can be a very useful tool to connect the vulnerability analysis with decision

7012,tree pits are attractive stormwater control measures scms for implementation in dense urban areas because of their small footprint their potentially low cost and the co benefits they may bring through improved street tree growth while they provide street trees with passive irrigation it remains to be determined if tree pits may achieve meaningful reductions in stormwater runoff we undertook a streetscape experiment to quantify runoff retention of tree pits in a heavy clay soil with low rates of exfiltration we calibrated and validated a water balance model using the field experiment data to identify tree pit characteristics driving runoff retention performance we then applied the model to different implementation scenarios to ascertain how useful these tree pits may be at reducing runoff to return a more natural flow regime in dense urban areas the main drivers of runoff retention were identified as exfiltration rates from the tree pits and the connected impervious catchment size our results show that it is possible even in dense urban streetscapes with low conductivity heavy clay soils to achieve a 90 reduction in annual runoff and to reduce days of runoff to just 15 days per year however to achieve this tree pits need to be sized between 2 5 and 8 of the impervious catchment area depending on pit exfiltration rates in practice achieving these tree pit to catchment area ratios for a dense urban streetscape will require consideration in the planning stages of development works and is expected to be most feasible through implementation of tree pits alongside a suite of other complementary scms keywords stormwater water sensitive urban design sustainable urban drainage systems low impact design natural flow regime urban stream syndrome 1 introduction the connection of impervious areas to receiving waterways through hydraulically efficient stormwater drainage systems and the subsequent alteration of the flow regime is the primary cause of urban waterway degradation booth et al 2015 hatt et al 2004 poff and zimmerman 2010 alteration of the flow regime specifically the increase in volume and frequency of surface runoff causes erosion channel incision and degrades the habitat value of receiving waterways vietz et al 2014 leading to a loss of sensitive species poff et al 2010 walsh et al 2005b as urbanization continues to increase impervious surface cover through expansion and in fill development and the impacts upon receiving waterways become more widely understood action to reduce runoff from urban areas is gaining momentum implementation of stormwater control measures scms has been proposed to disconnect impervious areas from receiving waterways burns et al 2012 one objective of such an approach is to retain large volumes of runoff throughout the urban catchment returning the hydrological regime of the receiving waterway as close as possible to its pre development state i e to mimic the natural flow regime poff et al 1997 a range of flow characteristics have been proposed to guide such runoff retention efforts in urban areas including i reducing runoff frequency and ii reducing total runoff volume fletcher et al 2014 based on comparisons with the hydrology of natural catchments reducing the frequency of runoff events to around 15 days per year has been proposed as a target in south eastern australia walsh et al 2005a in the same region a target of retaining 77 93 of the annual runoff volume has been proposed by burns et al 2013 drawing on the hydrological analyses of zhang et al 2001 such targets based on analysis of hydrology of natural catchments in the region of interest provide useful guidance for the design and implementation of scms aimed at mitigating flow disturbance to receiving waters and highlight the importance of runoff retention walsh et al 2012 tree pits are scms that are particularly suitable for the space constraints of dense urban environments due to their inherent small size when compared to other vegetated scms such as engineered wetlands biofilter systems or roadside swales moreland city council 2013 in their simplest form tree pits may direct runoff to a single tree planted in native soil providing a source of passive irrigation alternatively more complex tree pits may employ a highly engineered imported biofiltration media and include connection to the stormwater drainage system center for watershed protection 2012 payne et al 2015 tree pits are increasingly being implemented to achieve the co benefits of greening streetscapes that would otherwise be devoid of vegetation canopy cover coutts and harris 2012 livesley et al 2016 mullaney et al 2015 indeed tree pits may increase tree canopy cover in a shorter timeframe than traditionally planted street trees grey et al 2018 tree canopy cover itself provides a runoff retention benefit through the direct interception of rainfall armson et al 2013 baptista et al 2018 berland et al 2017 livesley et al 2014 tree pits intercepting runoff from the road gutter may provide not only a source of passive irrigation for the tree but also extend their runoff retention benefit beyond just canopy interception however it remains to be determined what impact tree pits may have on mitigating runoff and under what circumstances they may be most beneficial previous work on trees in scms has focused on permeable paving morgenroth and visser 2011 structural soils bartens et al 2009 xiao and mcpherson 2011 and bioswales scharenbroch et al 2015 or as one component of the vegetation within large bioretention systems hunt et al 2006 li et al 2009 for tree pits specifically whilst there has been some work previously on their effectiveness at nutrient reduction denman et al 2016 denman et al 2006 it remains to be determined how effective they may be at runoff retention trees have the potential to evapotranspire large volumes of water creating more available storage capacity prior to the next runoff event berland et al 2017 tree water use is therefore potentially a key factor in driving retention performance of tree pits wadzuk et al 2015 other tree pit characteristics expected to influence retention performance include the infiltration rate into the pit s substrate exfiltration rate from the pit to the underlying soil winston et al 2016 and the size of the pits realtive to their catchment bratieres et al 2008 davis et al 2009 indeed the often small footprint of tree pits relative to the contributing road and roof impervious catchment areas may constrain runoff retention performance davis et al 2012 improved understanding of these factors influencing the tree pit water balance will allow for quantification of the runoff retention performance that may be expected of tree pits and may lead to development of techniques to improve performance further it will allow for the identification and planning of scenarios in which tree pits provide greatest runoff retention benefit in this study we undertook a streetscape experiment to characterise the runoff retention performance of small tree pits in a dense urban area we used these data to construct calibrate and validate a mechanistic model to simulate the water balance of a tree pit investigating what factors may improve or hinder runoff retention performance finally the model was applied to theoretical implementation scenarios to determine under what circumstances tree pits may be most effective at retaining runoff and meeting runoff volume and frequency targets 2 methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the study site was located in a residential street typical of the inner north region of greater melbourne australia as used in a companion study by grey et al 2018 the region has a temperate climate and receives an average annual rainfall of 587 mm evenly distributed across the year bureau of meteorology 2017 the predominant soil type of the study site was classified by textural analysis as per mcdonald et al 1990 as a heavy clay five replicates of three different tree pit designs were installed during winter june 2015 i a native soil tree pit soil ii a biofilter sand tree pit sand and iii a tree planted into a native soil cutout adjacent to a biofilter sand pit without a tree adjacent fig 1 installation of the soil treatment involved cutting a 1 2 m gap in the kerb removing a 1 2 m by 0 6 m rectangular section of the existing asphalt footpath giving the pit a 0 72 m2 surface area removing the native soil down to 100 mm below the road gutter extended detention depth and planting of the tree within the pit the sand treatment involved the same procedure except the native soil was removed down to a depth of 500 mm below the road gutter level and replaced with a biofiltration filter media profile consisting of from bottom to top 75 mm of gravel 25 mm of coarse sand and 300 mm of sandy loam leaving a 100 mm detention depth as per payne et al 2015 the adjacent treatment was similar to the sand treatment however instead of planting the tree within the pit receiving runoff water an additional 1 2 m by 0 6 m rectangular section of the existing asphalt footpath was removed directly adjacent and the tree was planted in the native soil of this adjacent cutout the purpose of the adjacent treatment was based upon the theory that a tree planted and growing outside of the periodically saturated pit substrates may well grow better and therefore use more water thereby improving the overall runoff retention performance of the system the trees planted into the pits were acer campestre l with a median stem diameter at the time of planting of 23 mm taken at 0 5 m above the ground 2 2 meteorological measurements and defining natural flow regime targets a climate station with rainfall gauge was installed at a height of 2 5 m on a metal sign pole at a location central to all tree pits so that climate data was captured within 250 m of all of the treatment replicates to quantify daily crop reference evapotranspiration eto fig 2 b measurements of temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were taken using a climate station and recorded on a one hour time step cr1000 data logger campbell scientific australia pty ltd garbutt aus daily eto was computed from this data using the fao penman monteith equation allen 1998 rainfall was measured using a self emptying tipping bucket with a 0 2 mm resolution fig 2a davis rainfall gauge dataflow systems ltd auckland nz distinct rainfall events were defined as having greater than 4 h between individual tips given the very short times of concentration of the catchments of each tree pit rainfall recorded during the study period was similar to the long term average to evaluate how effective tree pits may be at restoring the natural flow regime scenarios were evaluated against targets of achieving i a maximum of 15 runoff days per year walsh et al 2005a and ii an annual volumetric runoff retention of 77 93 burns et al 2013 frequency analysis of the 2016 rainfall data showed that rainfall events of 11 5 mm or greater occurred 15 times in this year thus the modeled scenario should have the capacity to retain the runoff walsh et al 2009 from a 11 5 mm rainfall event to prevent runoff being discharged downstream on more than 15 days in the year 2 3 quantification of runoff generated from the streetscape runoff generated from each rainfall event was determined from the catchment area for each tree pit an initial loss factor and measured rainfall each catchment area was defined as the connected impervious area contributing runoff that reached the road gutter and hence tree pit these areas were identified from desktop gis analysis esri global inc redlands usa and field observations of public roads and footpaths and private driveways concrete yards paths impervious areas contributing to gutter flow building roofs were not directly connected to the kerb and channel and therefore excluded pits were installed as cut outs into the footpath in a line along the gutter on both sides of the street pits were installed on grade i e not at sag points with a longitudinal fall of 2 across the approximately 500 m long study site the catchment areas that drained into individual tree pits ranged from 100 m2 to 480 m2 with a median of 200 m2 table 1 the median pit size was therefore 0 3 of its catchment range 0 15 0 72 total impervious cover was 81 of the whole study area and the impervious area contributing to runoff that reached the road gutter was 42 of the whole study area to account for initial loss due to small storages within each catchment a comparison of the theoretical runoff and the recorded increases in soil substrate water level for events small enough to be completely captured by all pits i e no bypassing occurring was undertaken summarising all events 0 6 mm indicated a median initial loss of 0 1 mm this initial loss is within the range of expected values 0 1 1 1 mm reported by van de ven et al 1992 effective rainfall on an event basis was calculated as the measured rainfall minus this 0 1 mm initial loss total runoff was then calculated from the known catchment areas and effective rainfall 2 4 quantification of runoff retention by tree pits to quantify the volume of runoff captured by each tree pit water level sensors dataflow systems ltd christchurch nz were installed in the extended detention zone above ground and soil substrate below ground for each replicate the water level sensors were 0 5 m long and installed in perforated pvc access tubes water level was recorded on a six minute time step fig 2c volume captured was calculated from the pit surface area and the sum of positive increases in the soil substrate water level that occurred during each rainfall event runoff retention was then calculated as the volume captured as a proportion of total runoff on an event basis measurements of runoff retention commenced on 08 september 2015 and were completed on 31 december 2016 2 5 statistical analysis streetscape experiment one way analysis of variance anova was used to identify differences in runoff retention total and event based among treatments and tukey s post hoc tests were used to identify significant differences at the 95 confidence interval one soil replicate was compromised early in the study and water levels in one adjacent replicate were unable to be measured due to a preferential flow path below the installed water level sensor as such these replicates were excluded from analysis i e n 13 r version 3 3 3 was used for all data analysis r core team 2017 2 6 water balance model to understand the water regime of the tree pits in detail a mechanistic model of the individual tree pit water balance was constructed the model was developed using r r core team 2017 based on a series of input parameters and equations as shown in fig 3 and described below the model outputs were runoff retention on an event basis total runoff retention and the number of runoff events not fully captured by the individual pit ranges for model input parameters were

accounted for by mulitplying the growing season kc by 0 45 based upon a ratio of initial to mid season crop coefficients for deciduous almond trees allen 1998 there is little specific literature on kc values for non crop trees with general reported values for kc ranging from 0 2 to 1 3 allen 1998 connellan 2013 as such this range was adopted for model calibration 2 6 2 model input parameters and calibration ranges the measured rainfall and eto data from the field experiment were used as the meteorological inputs into the model the model utilised a six minute timestep during rainfall events and for the two hour period following the last recorded rainfall tip and a one hour timestep otherwise where the dynamics are much more temporally damped rainfall events were considered discrete events if there was greater than four hours between tips the initial loss was reset between events the input parameters on which the model relied were catchment size initial loss exfiltration rate infiltration rate crop factor and porosity the model was run using the period of data from 08 september 2015 to 31 december 2016 the period from 08 september 2015 to 31 december 2015 was used for the purpose of model spin up and disregarded to ensure model starting parameters did not affect outputs model calibration validation sensitivity and implementation scenario analysis was undertaken using the period 01 january 2016 to 31 december 2016 the tree pits contained either the native heavy clay soil or the imported biofiltration substrate profile the saturated hydraulic conductivity of these two soil types may range from 1 to 300 mm hr 1 pachepsky and park 2015 rawls et al 1998 to account for possible increased infiltration into the tree pit soil substrate due to preferential flow pathways or edge effects of the pits an initial extended range of 1 500 mm hr 1 was adopted for model calibration garcía gutiérrez et al 2017 le coustumer et al 2007 porosity for each soil type was determined following the procedure set out in blake 2008 porosity was found to be 0 40 cm3 cm 3 for the sandy loam and 0 47 cm3 cm 3 for clay soil within the model these values were assigned as a set parameter to each pit depending upon its soil type reported soil porosity ranges from 0 39 to 0 50 cm3 cm 3 rawls et al 1998 and these values were used as the range of porosity values in the sensitivity analysis to estimate a range of pit exfiltration rates eight rainfall events were selected where the majority of pits filled the 100 mm detention depth above the soil or substrate and then drained to the bottom 100 mm of substrate i e 400 500 mm below surface level over a series of days free from any subsequent rainfall or runoff fig 4 a exfiltration rates were calculated from the water level sensors and grouped by 100 mm layers below the soil substrate surface median exfiltration rates were then calculated by layer replicate and event analysis of the median exfiltration rate during these eight events identified that the rates of exfiltration were not constant with depth but were greater in the upper layers of the pit profile to account for this changing profile of exfiltration rates a ratio of median exfiltration rates was developed for 100 mm depth intervals of each pit fig 4b the median ratio among all pits was found to be 5 4 3 2 1 corresponding to depths 0 100 mm 100 200 mm 200 300 mm 400 500 mm and 400 500 mm below the pit surface this changing profile of exfiltration rates was similar to that observed by winston et al 2016 and adopted in the model median exfiltration rates in the upper 0 100 mm depth range of the tree pits ranged from 0 4 to 52 5 mm hr 1 based on these rates the initial exfiltration rate range selected for model calibration was 0 2 to 60 mm hr 1 2 6 3 calibration and validation of model model calibration and validation performance were assessed through calculation of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 for runoff retention on an event basis models were calibrated for each individual pit table 1 using rainfall events commencing in odd numbered months a total of 99 events validation using the optimized parameters from calibration was undertaken using rainfall events commencing in even numbered months a total of 88 events 2 6 4 model sensitivity test to analyze the effect of each model input parameter on runoff retention a sensitivity analysis was undertaken individual model input variables were altered whilst holding other inputs constant at their calibrated values input variables were run at multiples of 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 0 of their calibrated values and the nse of the corresponding model output calculated if this series resulted in an input variable outside of its pre specified calibration ranges it was disregarded from analysis nse values and input variables were standardized as a proportion of their calibrated values to allow comparison among replicates 2 7 implementation scenarios to explore the role tree pits may play in reducing runoff from urban catchments we applied the model to three probable implementation scenarios based on the streetscape catchment fig 5 the as constructed whole catchment scenario has tree pits located as they were for this field experiment with application limited due to the site constraints of an existing residential street such as existing street trees vehicle crossovers and underground services this scenario contains the largest catchment sizes of the tested scenarios with the catchments including all impervious areas within the neighbourhood sub catchment including roofs and private lot impervious areas as is common practice in many urban areas the avenue planting whole catchment scenario has pits located as to create a lined avenue of trees along the entire length of the street individual pit locations were based upon trees developing 6 m diameter crowns with pits positioned so the crowns are just touching when fully grown it is assumed there are no existing site constraints limiting tree pit placement and represents what may be possible for tree pit locations if considered at the time of a development again catchments cover all impervious areas including roofs and private lot impervious areas the avenue planting public realm scenario is the same as the avenue planting whole catchment scenario except that tree pits only receive runoff from the impervious areas of the public realm such as roads and footpaths each scenario was explored using the minimum median and maximum exfiltration rates calculated from the streetscape experiment to identify likely ranges in runoff retention that may be expected in the case that the 15 runoff days per year target was not met in the above scenarios additional model runs with decreasing catchment areas were undertaken until the maximum catchment size required to meet the 15 runoff days target was identified 3 results 3 1 streetscape experiment runoff retention runoff retention of the individual streetscape experiment tree pits was low with median retention on an event basis never exceeding 60 fig 6 a as expected higher runoff retention was observed for smaller rainfall events with retention decreasing for rainfall events greater than 5 mm fig 6a there were no significant differences in mean runoff retention among treatments on an event basis p 0 42 fig 6b however there was high variability among replicates p 0 001 fig 6c runoff retention for individual events was up to 100 in some tree pits but the median retention was 30 or less mean total runoff retention was not significantly different among treatments p 0 21 figure s1 median total runoff retention was 11 of the total runoff volume range 4 33 3 2 water balance model and sensitivity analysis each individual pit was calibrated separately with a mean calibration nse of 0 71 range 0 63 0 83 table 1 figure s2 and mean validation nse of 0 69 range 0 60 0 82 table 1 figure s3 no significant differences were found among the three treatments for runoff retention among all replicates the median exfiltration rate was 6 mm hr 1 range 1 34 mm hr 1 median infiltration rate 500 mm hr 1 range 100 500 mm hr 1 and median crop factor 1 3 range 0 2 1 3 table 1 the sensitivity analysis identified exfiltration rate as having the largest influence on tree pit runoff retention fig 7 assuming a pit exfiltration rate half the calibrated value reduced nse by 18 from 0 71 to 0 58 catchment size also influenced tree pit retention with a catchment size half the calibrated value reducing nse by 11 from 0 71 to 0 63 porosity infiltration rate and crop factor had only limited influence on pit retention with changes in these factors reducing nse by 5 from 0 71 to 0 67 as there were no significant differences in runoff performance among tree pits with imported biofilter sand or native clay soils a porosity of 0 40 cm3 cm 3 i e the porosity of the sand and adjacent treatments was used to represent all three treatments in the model 3 3 implementation scenarios total runoff retention for the as constructed whole catchment scenario based on the median exfiltration rate encountered in the field experiment was 5 of runoff over the modelled 2016 year fig 8 table s1 total runoff retention was 10 for the highest exfiltration rate encountered and 2 for the lowest exfiltration rate i e range 2 10 total runoff retention increased for the avenue planting whole catchment scenario to a median of 26 range 11 46 and was highest for the avenue planting public realm scenario with a median of 49 range 24 75 the total volume of water lost through evapotranspiration over the modelled 2016 year ranged from 3 kl 0 3 of volume intercepted in the as constructed maximum exfiltration rate scenario to 111 kl 11 of volume intercepted in the avenue planting whole catchment minimum exfiltration rate scenario table s1 the total volume of water lost through exfiltration over the modelled 2016 year ranged from 134 kl 88 of volume intercepted in the as constructed minimum exfiltration rate scenario to 4 263 kl 99 of volume intercepted in the avenue planting whole catchment maximum exfiltration rate scenario table s1 with no tree pits runoff occurred from the streetscape catchment on 183 days per year for the as constructed whole catchment scenario there was no reduction in the number of runoff days per year regardless of exfiltration rate fig 8d the number of runoff days reduced for the avenue planting whole catchment scenario to a median of 91 days range 57 144 days and was lowest for the avenue planting public realm scenario with a median of 55 days range 29 99 days fig 8e fig 8f again increased runoff retention was seen for small rainfall events with retention performance decreasing as event size increased the full details on the water balance for each scenario are presented in table s1 none of the above scenarios were able to reduce the number of runoff generating days to the target of 15 per year even the best performing scenario avenue planting public realm with maximum infiltration rates recorded 29 runoff days per year in this scenario runoff was generated from an event size as small as 3 7 mm albeit with 95 volume retention of this event well below the 11 5 mm rainfall event retention capacity identified to meet the 15 day runoff frequency target total flow over the year was reduced by 75 slightly below the volume loss target range of 77 93 to achieve the flow frequency target assuming the median exfiltration rate of 6 mm hr 1 the catchment area of a tree pit was required to be reduced to 16 2 m2 corresponding to an increase in tree pit size as 4 4 of the catchment area table s2 for the minimum exfiltration rate the required catchment was 9 0 m2 tree pit area to catchment area ratio of 8 0 and for the maximum exfiltration rate 29 0 m2 tree pit area to catchment area ratio of 2 5 achieving the 15 days per year runoff frequency target resulted in total retention as a percentage of runoff of approximately 90 across the range of infiltration rates the modelled minimum tree pit area to catchment area ratios required to meet the runoff volume and frequency targets for selected exfiltration rates within the site s 1 34 mm hr 1 range are shown in table s2 4 discussion 4 1 streescape tree pit runoff retention performance runoff retention performance of the streetscape tree pits was low with a median total runoff retention of 11 being well short of the 77 93 volume retention target burns et al 2013 this low runoff retention performance was also below that of previous studies of bioretention systems achieving runoff retention in the range of 50 78 hunt et al 2006 li et al 2009 page et al 2015 however runoff retention among some individual tree pits was much higher than the median fig 6c suggesting potential for improved runoff retention performance although tree pit treatment design had no impact on runoff retention performance sensitivity analysis of the model suggests that runoff retention was highly influenced by catchment size and exfiltration rate into surrounding soils as a proportion of catchment area the streetscape tree pits were small 1 when compared to the typical range reported for existing studies of bioretention systems 2 6 davis 2008 hunt et al 2006 li et al 2009 and increasing pit size will likely improve runoff retention performance davis et al 2012 runoff retention in the model was also sensitive to soil exfiltration rate although high runoff retention can be achieved in heavy textured soils winston et al 2016 runoff retention in the tree pits was likely limited by the low median exfiltration rate 6 mm hr 1 typical of the heavy clay soils rawls et al 1998 saxton and rawls 2006 the poor runoff retention performance of the streetscape tree pits may therefore be explained by systems being both undersized and in soils with low exfiltration rates 4 2 under what scenarios will tree pits be most effective at retaining urban stormwater runoff the as constructed whole catchment scenario in the model provided only limited runoff retention due to i low tree pit area to catchment area ratios and ii low soil exfiltration rates indeed none of the implementation scenarios met the 77 93 volume retention target range burns et al 2013 or achieved a runoff frequency of 15 days of runoff per year walsh et al 2005a the poor total runoff retention of the scenarios may be explained by the small size of the pits at 0 1 1 6 of their catchment area houdeshel et al 2012 and low exfiltration rates the highest exfiltration rate scenario being 34 mm hr 1 reductions in runoff frequency were also below the target for all scenarios resulting from the low rainfall event size at which runoff began to bypass the pits fig 8 as sections of the as constructed whole catchment scenario remained untreated resulting from pit locations being heavily influenced by existing site constraints runoff frequency remained unchanged in this scenario given its binary nature i e runoff on a day is still counted as a runoff event even if the volume is reduced this is typical of a retrofit situation where many existing constraints can severely restrict implementation opportunities to meet the volume loss and runoff days targets would require tree pit area to catchment area ratios larger than those of the avenue planting public realm scenario table s2 however due to the size of the fully grown tree crowns increasing the density of tree pits beyond this scenario would be difficult therefore meeting the required tree pit area to catchment area ratios would require increasing the size of the tree pits themselves this may be feasible for the smaller tree pit areas required for higher exfiltration rates but difficult to achieve within the confined urban landscape jones and macdonald 2007 when infiltration rates are low for example meeting the volume loss and runoff days targets for the catchment sizes of the avenue planting public realm scenario 46 m2 with an exfiltration rate of 34 mm hr 1 requires a tree pit area of only 1 1 m2 tree pit area to catchment area ratio of 2 5 but this increases to 3 7 m2 or 8 4 for an exfiltration rate of 1 mm hr 1 however even in the dense urban spaces of new york city the standard street tree pit area is 4 5 m2 5 feet by 10 feet new york city 2016 indicating that this may be a feasible proposition the area and density of tree pits within a streetscape required to achieve significant runoff retention highlights the need to consider their implementation in the planning and design phases of streetscape development or re development walsh et al 2016 perhaps more importantly the smaller and more achievable tree pit areas of the avenue planting public realm scenario compared with the scenarios treating the whole catchment reinforce that meeting runoff retention targets will more likely be achieved via a treatment train of various scm types burns et al 2015 an approach where rainwater tanks capture runoff from roofs and permeable paving is used to reduce areas of impervious concrete or asphalt cover will reduce catchments required to be treated by tree pits burns et al 2015 page et al 2015 this complementary scm approach will result in smaller tree pits that provide greater flexibility for implementation and therefore a higher likelihood of achieving significant runoff retention indeed such an approach is more likely to achieve the broader urban runoff outcomes required to restore the health of urban waterways such as in catchment retention e g rainwater or stormwater harvesting evapotranspiration restoring groundwater and baseflows e g infiltration or controlled release bioretention and mitigating urban runoff peaks detention through storage burns et al 2015 hunt et al 2012 walsh et al 2016 therefore tree pits may play a significant role in reducing runoff from urban areas particularly if they are targeted at only treating the runoff from impervious surfaces in the public realm the dominant mechanism for runoff to leave the tree pits was exfiltration accounting for at least 88 of intercepted runoff in the model however the large variation in pit exfiltration rates 16 567 of the median and a changing profile of exfiltration rates with increasing depth cautions whether the runoff retained by the tree pits is truly exfiltrated into groundwater and subsequently to the baseflow of a receiving stream kaushal and belt 2012 it may be possible that preferential hydrologic pathways take exfiltrated runoff out of the catchment e g into a sewer system or alternatively offer an expedited subterraneous pathway to the receiving waterway bonneau et al 2017 bonneau et al 2018 even if all of the exfiltrated water is returned to baseflow there still remain questions over whether such a large volume of water infiltrating so close to the road pavement will have adverse impacts upon this urban infrastructure or other nearby environments locatelli et al 2017 or ultimately the receiving waterways walsh et al 2016 therefore whilst higher exfiltration rates result in increased runoff retention performance the fate of infiltrated water needs to be determined before tree pits and scms more generally can be confirmed as contributing towards restoring a more natural flow regime for urban waterways with the tree being a dominant feature of the tree pit it was expectated to contribute signficiantly to the tree pit water balance however evapotranspiration was found to make only a small contribution to runoff loss from the tree pits representing a mean loss of just 4 of total runoff volume received and retained by the tree pits table s1 this low evapotranspiration component was perhaps unsurprising due to the small tree size even at the conclusion of this study mean tree height of 3 5 m and mean canopy width of 1 3 m previous studies of bioswale and bioretention systems have found the evapotranspiration components of these systems to range from 3 to 72 hess et al 2017 li et al 2009 scharenbroch et al 2015 this large range suggests that there is potential for the evapotranspiration component of the tree pits to increase as the tree matures and subsequently increases its water usage however very little information is currently available on the contribution of trees to the water balance in scms 5 conclusions the results of this study indicate that tree pits have the potential to make a significant contribution to reducing runoff from urban areas but will require careful planning to achieve this goal within the space constraints of the city landscape sensitivity analysis of the factors affecting the tree pit water balance identified the key drivers of runoff retention peformance to be exfiltration rate and catchment size the streetscape experiment as constructed provided only limited runoff retention due to insufficient tree pit areas for the large catchment areas and low soil exfiltration rates at the site median exfiltration rate 6 mm hr 1 applying the water balance model to different tree pit implementation scenarios for the study site identified that a tree pit area to catchment area ratio of 4 4 would achieve a runoff volume reduction of 90 and a return to only 15 days runoff per year meeting targets to return a near natural flow regime burns et al 2013 walsh et al 2005a to achieve a tree pit area to catchment area ratio of 4 4 for the whole study streetscape would require implementing tree pits at the highest density feasible resulting in tree pit catchment areas of 110 m2 and increasing the tree pit area from 0 72 m2 to at least 4 8 m2 however if runoff generated from the private realm can be intercepted by other scms such as rainwater tanks and permeable paving the tree pits can be designed and scaled to treat the public streetscape only treating only the public streetscape results in tree pit catchment areas of 46 m2 and requires tree pit areas to only increase to 2 0 m2 therefore increasing the feasibility of implementation we conclude that tree pits may indeed be a useful tool to restore the natural flow regime even in low infiltration soils and dense urban environments particularly if used as part of a suite of complementary tools acknowledgements

7012,tree pits are attractive stormwater control measures scms for implementation in dense urban areas because of their small footprint their potentially low cost and the co benefits they may bring through improved street tree growth while they provide street trees with passive irrigation it remains to be determined if tree pits may achieve meaningful reductions in stormwater runoff we undertook a streetscape experiment to quantify runoff retention of tree pits in a heavy clay soil with low rates of exfiltration we calibrated and validated a water balance model using the field experiment data to identify tree pit characteristics driving runoff retention performance we then applied the model to different implementation scenarios to ascertain how useful these tree pits may be at reducing runoff to return a more natural flow regime in dense urban areas the main drivers of runoff retention were identified as exfiltration rates from the tree pits and the connected impervious catchment size our results show that it is possible even in dense urban streetscapes with low conductivity heavy clay soils to achieve a 90 reduction in annual runoff and to reduce days of runoff to just 15 days per year however to achieve this tree pits need to be sized between 2 5 and 8 of the impervious catchment area depending on pit exfiltration rates in practice achieving these tree pit to catchment area ratios for a dense urban streetscape will require consideration in the planning stages of development works and is expected to be most feasible through implementation of tree pits

channel incision and degrades the habitat value of receiving waterways vietz et al 2014 leading to a loss of sensitive species poff et al 2010 walsh et al 2005b as urbanization continues to increase impervious surface cover through expansion and in fill development and the impacts upon receiving waterways become more widely understood action to reduce runoff from urban areas is gaining momentum implementation of stormwater control measures scms has been proposed to disconnect impervious areas from receiving waterways burns et al 2012 one objective of such an approach is to retain large volumes of runoff throughout the urban catchment returning the hydrological regime of the receiving waterway as close as possible to its pre development state i e to mimic the natural flow regime poff et al 1997 a range of flow characteristics have been proposed to guide such runoff retention efforts in urban areas including i reducing runoff frequency and ii reducing total runoff volume fletcher et al 2014 based on comparisons with the hydrology of natural catchments reducing the frequency of runoff events to around 15 days per year has been proposed as a target in south eastern australia walsh et al 2005a in the same region a target of retaining 77 93 of the annual runoff volume has been proposed by burns et al 2013 drawing on the hydrological analyses of zhang et al 2001 such targets based on analysis of hydrology of natural catchments in the region of interest provide useful guidance for the design and implementation of scms aimed at mitigating flow disturbance to receiving waters and highlight the importance of runoff retention walsh et al 2012 tree pits are scms that are particularly suitable for the space constraints of dense urban environments due to their inherent small size when compared to other vegetated scms such as engineered wetlands biofilter systems or roadside swales moreland city council 2013 in their simplest form tree pits may direct runoff to a single tree planted in native soil providing a source of passive irrigation alternatively more complex tree pits may employ a highly engineered imported biofiltration media and include connection to the stormwater drainage system center for watershed protection 2012 payne et al 2015 tree pits are increasingly being implemented to achieve the co benefits of greening streetscapes that would otherwise be devoid of vegetation canopy cover coutts and harris 2012 livesley et al 2016 mullaney et al 2015 indeed tree pits may increase tree canopy cover in a shorter timeframe than traditionally planted street trees grey et al 2018 tree canopy cover itself provides a runoff retention benefit through the direct interception of rainfall armson et al 2013 baptista et al 2018 berland et al 2017 livesley et al 2014 tree pits intercepting runoff from the road gutter may provide not only a source of passive irrigation for the tree but also extend their runoff retention benefit beyond just canopy interception however it remains to be determined what impact tree pits may have on mitigating runoff and under what circumstances they may be most beneficial previous work on trees in scms has focused on permeable paving morgenroth and visser 2011 structural soils bartens et al 2009 xiao and mcpherson 2011 and bioswales scharenbroch et al 2015 or as one component of the vegetation within large bioretention systems hunt et al 2006 li et al 2009 for tree pits specifically whilst there has been some work previously on their effectiveness at nutrient reduction denman et al 2016 denman et al 2006 it remains to be determined how effective they may be at runoff retention trees have the potential to evapotranspire large volumes of water creating more available storage capacity prior to the next runoff event berland et al 2017 tree water use is therefore potentially a key factor in driving retention performance of tree pits wadzuk et al 2015 other tree pit characteristics expected to influence retention performance include the infiltration rate into the pit s substrate exfiltration rate from the pit to the underlying soil winston et al 2016 and the size of the pits realtive to their catchment bratieres et al 2008 davis et al 2009 indeed the often small footprint of tree pits relative to the contributing road and roof impervious catchment areas may constrain runoff retention performance davis et al 2012 improved understanding of these factors influencing the tree pit water balance will allow for quantification of the runoff retention performance that may be expected of tree pits and may lead to development of techniques to improve performance further it will allow for the identification and planning of scenarios in which tree pits provide greatest runoff retention benefit in this study we undertook a streetscape experiment to characterise the runoff retention performance of small tree pits in a dense urban area we used these data to construct calibrate and validate a mechanistic model to simulate the water balance of a tree pit investigating what factors may improve or hinder runoff retention performance finally the model was applied to theoretical implementation scenarios to determine under what circumstances tree pits may be most effective at retaining runoff and meeting runoff volume and frequency targets 2 methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the study site was located in a residential street typical of the inner north region of greater melbourne australia as used in a companion study by grey et al 2018 the region has a temperate climate and receives an average annual rainfall of 587 mm evenly distributed across the year bureau of meteorology 2017 the predominant soil type of the study site was classified by textural analysis as per mcdonald et al 1990 as a heavy clay five replicates of three different tree pit designs were installed during winter june 2015 i a native soil tree pit soil ii a biofilter sand tree pit sand and iii a tree planted into a native soil cutout adjacent to a biofilter sand pit without a tree adjacent fig 1 installation of the soil treatment involved cutting a 1 2 m gap in the kerb removing a 1 2 m by 0 6 m rectangular section of the existing asphalt footpath giving the pit a 0 72 m2 surface area removing the native soil down to 100 mm below the road gutter extended detention depth and planting of the tree within the pit the sand treatment involved the same procedure except the native soil was removed down to a depth of 500 mm below the road gutter level and replaced with a biofiltration filter media profile consisting of from bottom to top 75 mm of gravel 25 mm of coarse sand and 300 mm of sandy loam leaving a 100 mm detention depth as per payne et al 2015 the adjacent treatment was similar to the sand treatment however instead of planting the tree within the pit receiving runoff water an additional 1 2 m by 0 6 m rectangular section of the existing asphalt footpath was removed directly adjacent and the tree was planted in the native soil of this adjacent cutout the purpose of the adjacent treatment was based upon the theory that a tree planted and growing outside of the periodically saturated pit substrates may well grow better and therefore use more water thereby improving the overall runoff retention performance of the system the trees planted into the pits were acer campestre l with a median stem diameter at the time of planting of 23 mm taken at 0 5 m above the ground 2 2 meteorological measurements and defining natural flow regime targets a climate station with rainfall gauge was installed at a height of 2 5 m on a metal sign pole at a location central to all tree pits so that climate data was captured within 250 m of all of the treatment replicates to quantify daily crop reference evapotranspiration eto fig 2 b measurements of temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation were taken using a climate station and recorded on a one hour time step cr1000 data logger campbell scientific australia pty ltd garbutt aus daily eto was computed from this data using the fao penman monteith equation allen 1998 rainfall was measured using a self emptying tipping bucket with a 0 2 mm resolution fig 2a davis rainfall gauge dataflow systems ltd auckland nz distinct rainfall events were defined as having greater than 4 h between individual tips given the very short times of concentration of the catchments of each tree pit rainfall recorded during the study period was similar to the long term average to evaluate how effective tree pits may be at restoring the natural flow regime scenarios were evaluated against targets of achieving i a maximum of 15 runoff days per year walsh et al 2005a and ii an annual volumetric runoff retention of 77 93 burns et al 2013 frequency analysis of the 2016 rainfall data showed that rainfall events of 11 5 mm or greater occurred 15 times in this year thus the modeled scenario should have the capacity to retain the runoff walsh et al 2009 from a 11 5 mm rainfall event to prevent runoff being discharged downstream on more than 15 days in the year 2 3 quantification of runoff generated from the streetscape runoff generated from each rainfall event was determined from the catchment area for each tree pit an initial loss factor and measured rainfall each catchment area was defined as the connected impervious area contributing runoff that reached the road gutter and hence tree pit these areas were identified from desktop gis analysis esri global inc redlands usa and field observations of public roads and footpaths and private driveways concrete yards paths impervious areas contributing to gutter flow building roofs were not directly connected to the kerb and channel and therefore excluded pits were installed as cut outs into the footpath in a line along the gutter on both sides of the street pits were installed on grade i e not at sag points with a longitudinal fall of 2 across the approximately 500 m long study site the catchment areas that drained into individual tree pits ranged from 100 m2 to 480 m2 with a median of 200 m2 table 1 the median pit size was therefore 0 3 of its catchment range 0 15 0 72 total impervious cover was 81 of the whole study area and the impervious area contributing to runoff that reached the road gutter was 42 of the whole study area to account for initial loss due to small storages within each catchment a comparison of the theoretical runoff and the recorded increases in soil substrate water level for events small enough to be completely captured by all pits i e no bypassing occurring was undertaken summarising all events 0 6 mm indicated a median initial loss of 0 1 mm this initial loss is within the range of expected values 0 1 1 1 mm reported by van de ven et al 1992 effective rainfall on an event basis was calculated as the measured rainfall minus this 0 1 mm initial loss total runoff was then calculated from the known catchment areas and effective rainfall 2 4 quantification of runoff retention by tree pits to quantify the volume of runoff captured by each tree pit water level sensors dataflow systems ltd christchurch nz were installed in the extended detention zone above ground and soil substrate below ground for each replicate the water level sensors were 0 5 m long and installed in perforated pvc access tubes water level was recorded on a six minute time step fig 2c volume captured was calculated from the pit surface area and the sum of positive increases in the soil substrate water level that occurred during each rainfall event runoff retention was then calculated as the volume captured as a proportion of total runoff on an event basis measurements of runoff retention commenced on 08 september 2015 and were completed on 31 december 2016 2 5 statistical analysis streetscape experiment one way analysis of variance anova was used to identify differences in runoff retention total and event based among treatments and tukey s post hoc tests were used to identify significant differences at the 95 confidence interval one soil replicate was compromised early in the study and water levels in one adjacent replicate were unable to be measured due to a preferential flow path below the installed water level sensor as such these replicates were excluded from analysis i e n 13 r version 3 3 3 was used for all data analysis r core team 2017 2 6 water balance model to understand the water regime of the tree pits in detail a mechanistic model of the individual tree pit water balance was constructed the model was developed using r r core team 2017 based on a series of input parameters and equations as shown in fig 3 and described below the model outputs were runoff retention on an event basis total runoff retention and the number of runoff events not fully captured by the individual pit ranges for model input parameters were

accounted for by mulitplying the growing season kc by 0 45 based upon a ratio of initial to mid season crop coefficients for deciduous almond trees allen 1998 there is little specific literature on kc values for non crop trees with general reported values for kc ranging from 0 2 to 1 3 allen 1998 connellan 2013 as such this range was adopted for model calibration 2 6 2 model input parameters and calibration ranges the measured rainfall and eto data from the field experiment were used as the meteorological inputs into the model the model utilised a six minute timestep during rainfall events and for the two hour period following the last recorded rainfall tip and a one hour timestep otherwise where the dynamics are much more temporally damped rainfall events were considered discrete events if there was greater than four hours between tips the initial loss was reset between events the input parameters on which the model relied were catchment size initial loss exfiltration rate infiltration rate crop factor and porosity the model was run using the period of data from 08 september 2015 to 31 december 2016 the period from 08 september 2015 to 31 december 2015 was used for the purpose of model spin up and disregarded to ensure model starting parameters did not affect outputs model calibration validation sensitivity and implementation scenario analysis was undertaken using the period 01 january 2016 to 31 december 2016 the tree pits contained either the native heavy clay soil or the imported biofiltration substrate profile the saturated hydraulic conductivity of these two soil types may range from 1 to 300 mm hr 1 pachepsky and park 2015 rawls et al 1998 to account for possible increased infiltration into the tree pit soil substrate due to preferential flow pathways or edge effects of the pits an initial extended range of 1 500 mm hr 1 was adopted for model calibration garcía gutiérrez et al 2017 le coustumer et al 2007 porosity for each soil type was determined following the procedure set out in blake 2008 porosity was found to be 0 40 cm3 cm 3 for the sandy loam and 0 47 cm3 cm 3 for clay soil within the model these values were assigned as a set parameter to each pit depending upon its soil type reported soil porosity ranges from 0 39 to 0 50 cm3 cm 3 rawls et al 1998 and these values were used as the range of porosity values in the sensitivity analysis to estimate a range of pit exfiltration rates eight rainfall events were selected where the majority of pits filled the 100 mm detention depth above the soil or substrate and then drained to the bottom 100 mm of substrate i e 400 500 mm below surface level over a series of days free from any subsequent rainfall or runoff fig 4 a exfiltration rates were calculated from the water level sensors and grouped by 100 mm layers below the soil substrate surface median exfiltration rates were then calculated by layer replicate and event analysis of the median exfiltration rate during these eight events identified that the rates of exfiltration were not constant with depth but were greater in the upper layers of the pit profile to account for this changing profile of exfiltration rates a ratio of median exfiltration rates was developed for 100 mm depth intervals of each pit fig 4b the median ratio among all pits was found to be 5 4 3 2 1 corresponding to depths 0 100 mm 100 200 mm 200 300 mm 400 500 mm and 400 500 mm below the pit surface this changing profile of exfiltration rates was similar to that observed by winston et al 2016 and adopted in the model median exfiltration rates in the upper 0 100 mm depth range of the tree pits ranged from 0 4 to 52 5 mm hr 1 based on these rates the initial exfiltration rate range selected for model calibration was 0 2 to 60 mm hr 1 2 6 3 calibration and validation of model model calibration and validation performance were assessed through calculation of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 for runoff retention on an event basis models were calibrated for each individual pit table 1 using rainfall events commencing in odd numbered months a total of 99 events validation using the optimized parameters from calibration was undertaken using rainfall events commencing in even numbered months a total of 88 events 2 6 4 model sensitivity test to analyze the effect of each model input parameter on runoff retention a sensitivity analysis was undertaken individual model input variables were altered whilst holding other inputs constant at their calibrated values input variables were run at multiples of 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 0 of their calibrated values and the nse of the corresponding model output calculated if this series resulted in an input variable outside of its pre specified calibration ranges it was disregarded from analysis nse values and input variables were standardized as a proportion of their calibrated values to allow comparison among replicates 2 7 implementation scenarios to explore the role tree pits may play in reducing runoff from urban catchments we applied the model to three probable implementation scenarios based on the streetscape catchment fig 5 the as constructed whole catchment scenario has tree pits located as they were for this field experiment with application limited due to the site constraints of an existing residential street such as existing street trees vehicle crossovers and underground services this scenario contains the largest catchment sizes of the tested scenarios with the catchments including all impervious areas within the neighbourhood sub catchment including roofs and private lot impervious areas as is common practice in many urban areas the avenue planting whole catchment scenario has pits located as to create a lined avenue of trees along the entire length of the street individual pit locations were based upon trees developing 6 m diameter crowns with pits positioned so the crowns are just touching when fully grown it is assumed there are no existing site constraints limiting tree pit placement and represents what may be possible for tree pit locations if considered at the time of a development again catchments cover all impervious areas including roofs and private lot impervious areas the avenue planting public realm scenario is the same as the avenue planting whole catchment scenario except that tree pits only receive runoff from the impervious areas of the public realm such as roads and footpaths each scenario was explored using the minimum median and maximum exfiltration rates calculated from the streetscape experiment to identify likely ranges in runoff retention that may be expected in the case that the 15 runoff days per year target was not met in the above scenarios additional model runs with decreasing catchment areas were undertaken until the maximum catchment size required to meet the 15 runoff days target was identified 3 results 3 1 streetscape experiment runoff retention runoff retention of the individual streetscape experiment tree pits was low with median retention on an event basis never exceeding 60 fig 6 a as expected higher runoff retention was observed for smaller rainfall events with retention decreasing for rainfall events greater than 5 mm fig 6a there were no significant differences in mean runoff retention among treatments on an event basis p 0 42 fig 6b however there was high variability among replicates p 0 001 fig 6c runoff retention for individual events was up to 100 in some tree pits but the median retention was 30 or less mean total runoff retention was not significantly different among treatments p 0 21 figure s1 median total runoff retention was 11 of the total runoff volume range 4 33 3 2 water balance model and sensitivity analysis each individual pit was calibrated separately with a mean calibration nse of 0 71 range 0 63 0 83 table 1 figure s2 and mean validation nse of 0 69 range 0 60 0 82 table 1 figure s3 no significant differences were found among the three treatments for runoff retention among all replicates the median exfiltration rate was 6 mm hr 1 range 1 34 mm hr 1 median infiltration rate 500 mm hr 1 range 100 500 mm hr 1 and median crop factor 1 3 range 0 2 1 3 table 1 the sensitivity analysis identified exfiltration rate as having the largest influence on tree pit runoff retention fig 7 assuming a pit exfiltration rate half the calibrated value reduced nse by 18 from 0 71 to 0 58 catchment size also influenced tree pit retention with a catchment size half the calibrated value reducing nse by 11 from 0 71 to 0 63 porosity infiltration rate and crop factor had only limited influence on pit retention with changes in these factors reducing nse by 5 from 0 71 to 0 67 as there were no significant differences in runoff performance among tree pits with imported biofilter sand or native clay soils a porosity of 0 40 cm3 cm 3 i e the porosity of the sand and adjacent treatments was used to represent all three treatments in the model 3 3 implementation scenarios total runoff retention for the as constructed whole catchment scenario based on the median exfiltration rate encountered in the field experiment was 5 of runoff over the modelled 2016 year fig 8 table s1 total runoff retention was 10 for the highest exfiltration rate encountered and 2 for the lowest exfiltration rate i e range 2 10 total runoff retention increased for the avenue planting whole catchment scenario to a median of 26 range 11 46 and was highest for the avenue planting public realm scenario with a median of 49 range 24 75 the total volume of water lost through evapotranspiration over the modelled 2016 year ranged from 3 kl 0 3 of volume intercepted in the as constructed maximum exfiltration rate scenario to 111 kl 11 of volume intercepted in the avenue planting whole catchment minimum exfiltration rate scenario table s1 the total volume of water lost through exfiltration over the modelled 2016 year ranged from 134 kl 88 of volume intercepted in the as constructed minimum exfiltration rate scenario to 4 263 kl 99 of volume intercepted in the avenue planting whole catchment maximum exfiltration rate scenario table s1 with no tree pits runoff occurred from the streetscape catchment on 183 days per year for the as constructed whole catchment scenario there was no reduction in the number of runoff days per year regardless of exfiltration rate fig 8d the number of runoff days reduced for the avenue planting whole catchment scenario to a median of 91 days range 57 144 days and was lowest for the avenue planting public realm scenario with a median of 55 days range 29 99 days fig 8e fig 8f again increased runoff retention was seen for small rainfall events with retention performance decreasing as event size increased the full details on the water balance for each scenario are presented in table s1 none of the above scenarios were able to reduce the number of runoff generating days to the target of 15 per year even the best performing scenario avenue planting public realm with maximum infiltration rates recorded 29 runoff days per year in this scenario runoff was generated from an event size as small as 3 7 mm albeit with 95 volume retention of this event well below the 11 5 mm rainfall event retention capacity identified to meet the 15 day runoff frequency target total flow over the year was reduced by 75 slightly below the volume loss target range of 77 93 to achieve the flow frequency target assuming the median exfiltration rate of 6 mm hr 1 the catchment area of a tree pit was required to be reduced to 16 2 m2 corresponding to an increase in tree pit size as 4 4 of the catchment area table s2 for the minimum exfiltration rate the required catchment was 9 0 m2 tree pit area to catchment area ratio of 8 0 and for the maximum exfiltration rate 29 0 m2 tree pit area to catchment area ratio of 2 5 achieving the 15 days per year runoff frequency target resulted in total retention as a percentage of runoff of approximately 90 across the range of infiltration rates the modelled minimum tree pit area to catchment area ratios required to meet the runoff volume and frequency targets for selected exfiltration rates within the site s 1 34 mm hr 1 range are shown in table s2 4 discussion 4 1 streescape tree pit runoff retention performance runoff retention performance of the streetscape tree pits was low with a median total runoff retention of 11 being well short of the 77 93 volume retention target burns et al 2013 this low runoff retention performance was also below that of previous studies of bioretention systems achieving runoff retention in the range of 50 78 hunt et al 2006 li et al 2009 page et al 2015 however runoff retention among some individual tree pits was much higher than the median fig 6c suggesting potential for improved runoff retention performance although tree pit treatment design had no impact on runoff retention performance sensitivity analysis of the model suggests that runoff retention was highly influenced by catchment size and exfiltration rate into surrounding soils as a proportion of catchment area the streetscape tree pits were small 1 when compared to the typical range reported for existing studies of bioretention systems 2 6 davis 2008 hunt et al 2006 li et al 2009 and increasing pit size will likely improve runoff retention performance davis et al 2012 runoff retention in the model was also sensitive to soil exfiltration rate although high runoff retention can be achieved in heavy textured soils winston et al 2016 runoff retention in the tree pits was likely limited by the low median exfiltration rate 6 mm hr 1 typical of the heavy clay soils rawls et al 1998 saxton and rawls 2006 the poor runoff retention performance of the streetscape tree pits may therefore be explained by systems being both undersized and in soils with low exfiltration rates 4 2 under what scenarios will tree pits be most effective at retaining urban stormwater runoff the as constructed whole catchment scenario in the model provided only limited runoff retention due to i low tree pit area to catchment area ratios and ii low soil exfiltration rates indeed none of the implementation scenarios met the 77 93 volume retention target range burns et al 2013 or achieved a runoff frequency of 15 days of runoff per year walsh et al 2005a the poor total runoff retention of the scenarios may be explained by the small size of the pits at 0 1 1 6 of their catchment area houdeshel et al 2012 and low exfiltration rates the highest exfiltration rate scenario being 34 mm hr 1 reductions in runoff frequency were also below the target for all scenarios resulting from the low rainfall event size at which runoff began to bypass the pits fig 8 as sections of the as constructed whole catchment scenario remained untreated resulting from pit locations being heavily influenced by existing site constraints runoff frequency remained unchanged in this scenario given its binary nature i e runoff on a day is still counted as a runoff event even if the volume is reduced this is typical of a retrofit situation where many existing constraints can severely restrict implementation opportunities to meet the volume loss and runoff days targets would require tree pit area to catchment area ratios larger than those of the avenue planting public realm scenario table s2 however due to the size of the fully grown tree crowns increasing the density of tree pits beyond this scenario would be difficult therefore meeting the required tree pit area to catchment area ratios would require increasing the size of the tree pits themselves this may be feasible for the smaller tree pit areas required for higher exfiltration rates but difficult to achieve within the confined urban landscape jones and macdonald 2007 when infiltration rates are low for example meeting the volume loss and runoff days targets for the catchment sizes of the avenue planting public realm scenario 46 m2 with an exfiltration rate of 34 mm hr 1 requires a tree pit area of only 1 1 m2 tree pit area to catchment area ratio of 2 5 but this increases to 3 7 m2 or 8 4 for an exfiltration rate of 1 mm hr 1 however even in the dense urban spaces of new york city the standard street tree pit area is 4 5 m2 5 feet by 10 feet new york city 2016 indicating that this may be a feasible proposition the area and density of tree pits within a streetscape required to achieve significant runoff retention highlights the need to consider their implementation in the planning and design phases of streetscape development or re development walsh et al 2016 perhaps more importantly the smaller and more achievable tree pit areas of the avenue planting public realm scenario compared with the scenarios treating the whole catchment reinforce that meeting runoff retention targets will more likely be achieved via a treatment train of various scm types burns et al 2015 an approach where rainwater tanks capture runoff from roofs and permeable paving is used to reduce areas of impervious concrete or asphalt cover will reduce catchments required to be treated by tree pits burns et al 2015 page et al 2015 this complementary scm approach will result in smaller tree pits that provide greater flexibility for implementation and therefore a higher likelihood of achieving significant runoff retention indeed such an approach is more likely to achieve the broader urban runoff outcomes required to restore the health of urban waterways such as in catchment retention e g rainwater or stormwater harvesting evapotranspiration restoring groundwater and baseflows e g infiltration or controlled release bioretention and mitigating urban runoff peaks detention through storage burns et al 2015 hunt et al 2012 walsh et al 2016 therefore tree pits may play a significant role in reducing runoff from urban areas particularly if they are targeted at only treating the runoff from impervious surfaces in the public realm the dominant mechanism for runoff to leave the tree pits was exfiltration accounting for at least 88 of intercepted runoff in the model however the large variation in pit exfiltration rates 16 567 of the median and a changing profile of exfiltration rates with increasing depth cautions whether the runoff retained by the tree pits is truly exfiltrated into groundwater and subsequently to the baseflow of a receiving stream kaushal and belt 2012 it may be possible that preferential hydrologic pathways take exfiltrated runoff out of the catchment e g into a sewer system or alternatively offer an expedited subterraneous pathway to the receiving waterway bonneau et al 2017 bonneau et al 2018 even if all of the exfiltrated water is returned to baseflow there still remain questions over whether such a large volume of water infiltrating so close to the road pavement will have adverse impacts upon this urban infrastructure or other nearby environments locatelli et al 2017 or ultimately the receiving waterways walsh et al 2016 therefore whilst higher exfiltration rates result in increased runoff retention performance the fate of infiltrated water needs to be determined before tree pits and scms more generally can be confirmed as contributing towards restoring a more natural flow regime for urban waterways with the tree being a dominant feature of the tree pit it was expectated to contribute signficiantly to the tree pit water balance however evapotranspiration was found to make only a small contribution to runoff loss from the tree pits representing a mean loss of just 4 of total runoff volume received and retained by the tree pits table s1 this low evapotranspiration component was perhaps unsurprising due to the small tree size even at the conclusion of this study mean tree height of 3 5 m and mean canopy width of 1 3 m previous studies of bioswale and bioretention systems have found the evapotranspiration components of these systems to range from 3 to 72 hess et al 2017 li et al 2009 scharenbroch et al 2015 this large range suggests that there is potential for the evapotranspiration component of the tree pits to increase as the tree matures and subsequently increases its water usage however very little information is currently available on the contribution of trees to the water balance in scms 5 conclusions the results of this study indicate that tree pits have the potential to make a significant contribution to reducing runoff from urban areas but will require careful planning to achieve this goal within the space constraints of the city landscape sensitivity analysis of the factors affecting the tree pit water balance identified the key drivers of runoff retention peformance to be exfiltration rate and catchment size the streetscape experiment as constructed provided only limited runoff retention due to insufficient tree pit areas for the large catchment areas and low soil exfiltration rates at the site median exfiltration rate 6 mm hr 1 applying the water balance model to different tree pit implementation scenarios for the study site identified that a tree pit area to catchment area ratio of 4 4 would achieve a runoff volume reduction of 90 and a return to only 15 days runoff per year meeting targets to return a near natural flow regime burns et al 2013 walsh et al 2005a to achieve a tree pit area to catchment area ratio of 4 4 for the whole study streetscape would require implementing tree pits at the highest density feasible resulting in tree pit catchment areas of 110 m2 and increasing the tree pit area from 0 72 m2 to at least 4 8 m2 however if runoff generated from the private realm can be intercepted by other scms such as rainwater tanks and permeable paving the tree pits can be designed and scaled to treat the public streetscape only treating only the public

7013,inverse method can be used to fill the gap between huge amount of data from sensors and complex groundwater model the iterative ensemble smoother ies is one of the most efficient algorithms applied to groundwater modeling for data assimilation however the ies only works for multi gaussian fields because two point statistics are used to estimate the co relation between state variables and parameters in curvilinear geometries such as sinuous channels in fluvial deposits the distribution of hydraulic conductivity is non multigaussian multiple point geostatistics mpg method has gained popularity for modeling curvilinear structures by conditioning on directly measured data such as conductivities this paper is aimed at bridging the ies and mpg method via pilot points to deal with inverse problem for further conditioning on indirect data such as piezometric head in non gaussian fields as a result the better flow and transport modeling will be achieved because both data and the concept model e g geological structures are honored after data assimilation to do that the ies is used to update conductivities at pilot points by assimilating indirect data then the updated values at pilot points together with measured conductivities will be used as hard data to model hydraulic conductivity field via direct sampling an mpg method a synthetic example was used to demonstrate the methodology in terms of characterization of conductivity and flow and transport predictions the results show that this new approach can not only assimilate dynamic data into groundwater flow model but also preserve curvilinear structures keywords inverse modeling iterative ensemble smoother pilot point direct sampling 1 introduction accurate characterization of the spatial variation of hydrological

there are two steps that are routinely used to characterize the heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity in groundwater studies using direct and indirect measurements from the field first directly measured hydraulic conductivities normally termed as hard data can be conditioned through geostatistical approaches such as sequential gaussian simulation deutsch and journel 1992 gómez hernández and

include pilot point method ramarao et al 1995 self calibration method gomez hernandez et al 1997 the markov chain monte carlo method oliver et al 1997 and gradual deformation hu 2000 a comprehensive review of inverse methods can be found from the literature e g yeh 1986 franssen et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 comparing with inverse methods mentioned above the ensemble kalman filter enkf has increasingly gained popularity because of its cpu efficiency and ease of implementation franssen et al 2009 xu et al 2013 the enkf was first introduced by evensen 1994 and widely applied to a spectrum of fields such as groundwater modeling petroleum engineering weather forecast and oceanography reichle et al 2002 applied the enkf to estimate soil moisture by assimilating l band 1 4 ghz microwave radio brightness observations into a land surface model different ensemble sizes were tested in terms of the efficiency of the enkf using a series of synthetic experiments the results indicate that the enkf is an efficient data assimilation approach in land surface modeling for moderate ensemble size chen and zhang 2006 applied the enkf to update hydraulic conductivities by integrating observed hydraulic head data for a transient groundwater flow model in geologic formations a two dimensional example and a three dimensional example were used to test the capability of the enkf and the results show that the enkf could provide an efficient approach for the estimation of hydraulic conductivity gu et al 2005 applied the enkf to calibrate permeability using history pressure data in a reservoir model and concluded that the enkf can provide a faster computational speed and a reliable estimation of parameters in the synthetic example liu et al 2008 applied the enkf to inversely calibrate the hydraulic conductivity and transport parameters such as dispersivity using hydraulic head and tracer concentration data at the made site huang et al 2009 used the enkf to assimilate both hydraulic head and solute concentration data to update the hydraulic conductivity field in order to get a better prediction of solute transport kurtz et al 2014 employed the enkf to jointly assimilate piezometric head data and groundwater temperature for updating river bed conductivity in a river aquifer model li et al 2017 used both surface deformation and hydraulic head to calibrate the transmissivity and elastic inelastic specific storages via the enkf and a synthetic example shows that the enkf can effectively reduce model uncertainty after conditioning on all the data in a land subsidence model an alternative data assimilation method to the enkf is the ensemble smoother es which was first presented by van leeuwen and evensen 1996 and has been emerged as an effective and efficient approach for data assimilation the analysis scheme of the es is similar to the enkf however in es all the observation data are assimilated at once to update the state parameter instead of assimilating observations sequentially in the enkf because there is no recurring groundwater modeling the es has much less computational cost bailey and baù 2010 applied the es to calibrate the hydraulic conductivity by assimilating hydraulic head and return flow volume bailey et al 2012 used the es to improve the estimation of denitrification rate by assimilating nitrate concentration and nitrate mass data in order to improve the method and to avoid the impact of strong non linearity of the forward simulator an iterative es ies was proposed in which the same set of data is iteratively applied to update parameters li et al 2018 compared the enkf and the iterative es and found that the latter can achieve similar results as the enkf but have an advantage of less computational cost although the enkf ies has been extensively applied in subsurface flow models it only performs well in aquifers where the hydraulic conductivity follows a multigaussian distribution in curvilinear structures such as fractures in sedimentary rocks and channels in fluvial deposits the hydraulic conductivity does not have the multigaussian distribution multiple points geostatistics mpg method has been widely used to simulate the non multigaussian geological deposits in the past decades instead of using two point variogram based geostatistics mpg uses multiple point e g pattern to represent correlations of multiple variables in space strebelle 2002 proposed a single normal equation simulation snesim method to model the curvilinear structure using a training image the training image is a conceptual model which is composed of the potential structures of the target aquifer one of shortcomings for snesim is that it can only model categorical variables such as rock facies however aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and porosity in groundwater modeling are continuous variables more recently mariethoz et al 2010 developed a direct sampling ds method to simulate the geological curvilinear structures it can not only model categorical variables but also continuous variables and has an advantage of less computational cost although there is a wide range of methods to simulate the non multigaussian geological fields through mpg methods it is a challenge to conditioning on indirect data such as hydraulic head data for improved flow and transport predictions caers 2003 proposed a probability perturbation method to solve the inverse problem by updating mpg realizations simulated by snesim using a markov chain process until all observation data match simulated ones sarma et al 2009 applied a kernel based generalized enkf to update permeabilities in non gaussian reservoirs however the back transformation calculation is still a challenge to solve zhou et al 2011 presented a normal score enkf method where the non gaussian distributed log conductivity was transformed into the gaussian distributed log conductivity before implementing the enkf in order to handle the non gaussianity li et al 2018 developed an iterative normal score ensemble smoother using the same method to deal with non gaussianity in data assimilation zhou et al 2012 developed a pattern search based method based on the idea of ds method instead of just searching the hydraulic conductivity pattern the corresponding hydraulic head pattern is also included as a part of ensemble pattern search li et al 2013 proposed an ensemble pattern enpat search method as an extension to the pattern search based method by simultaneously updating both hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic head and an improved characterization of patterns is achieved in a synthetic example for groundwater modeling in this paper we propose a new approach to address the inverse problem of mpg simulations by coupling iterative es and direct sampling method specifically a set of pilot points are chosen randomly from the hydraulic conductivity field then they will be updated using dynamic data i e observation head via iterative es the updated conductivities at pilot points will be regarded as hard data to interpolate the hydraulic conductivity fields at un sampled locations using ds in order to preserve geological structures that are displayed in the concept model i e training image the proposed approach can not only efficiently assimilate dynamic data into groundwater modeling through the ies but also preserve the non multigaussian feature through ds the coupled ies ds method is built on the iterative es in assimilating dynamic data and on ds in modeling non multgaussian fields the proposed method will be demonstrated in a synthetic example in terms of conductivity characterization and flow and transport predictions 2 methodology 2 1 forward modeling the governing equation of groundwater transient flow in saturated porous media can be described as follows bear 1972 1 x k h x y k h y z k h z w s s h t where k is the hydraulic conductivity h is the hydraulic head s s is the specific storage t is time and w is the source and sink the governing equation for the solute transport with linear equilibrium adsorption can be described by the following differential equation bear 1972 2 ϕ d c q c ϕ r c t where c is solute concentration in the water phase ϕ is the porosity is the gradient operator d is the local hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor q is the darcy velocity given by q k h and r is retardation factor 2 2 inverse modeling the proposed inverse method is based on the coupling of iterative es and ds a detailed explanation of iterative ensemble smoother can be found in van leeuwen and evensen 1996 fig 1 is the flowchart of ies ds coupling with modflow harbaugh et al 2000 it can be summarized in following steps 1 build the joint vector 3 ψ lnk h in this vector k is the ensemble of log hydraulic conductivities at pilot points and h is the simulated heads after running modflow the i th realization in this vector can be described as follows 4 ψ i lnk 1 lnk 2 lnk m t h 1 h 2 h n 1 t h 1 h 2 h n 2 t h 1 h 2 h n k t i where m denotes the number of pilot points n denotes the number of nodes where hydraulic heads are collected k denotes the number of time step and t is the transpose matrix symbol unlike the enkf all simulated hydraulic head data at all time steps are jointed globally in the ies 2 calculate the error covariance for the predicted state 5 p e f 1 n e 1 i 1 n e ψ f ψ f ψ f ψ f t where f denotes the forecast state the overline denotes the mean of the forecast ensemble the mean of ensemble is used to represent the best estimate of the true value n e denotes the number of realizations in the ensemble broadly more realizations will provide a more accurate estimation of cross covariance but need a higher computational cost accordingly 3 calculate the kalman gain the kalman gain is a weight coefficient matrix and used to adjust the forecast matrix by minimizing the error between observation data and simulations d is an ensemble of observations with an error i for the ith realization d i is an observation vector including the true piezometric heads d and observation error i 6 d i d i r e is the ensemble error covariance 7 r e t kalman gain can be written as 8 k e p e f h t hp e f h t r e 1 where h is the measurement matrix 4 update the ensemble by the following equation 9 ψ i a ψ i f k e d i h ψ i f where ψ i a is the updated realizations and ψ i f is the forecast realizations 5 interpolate both the updated hydraulic conductivities at pilot points and hard data to un sampled locations using ds method the algorithm of the ds is described in detail in mariethoz et al 2010 6 go back to step 1 until the mismatch of hydraulic heads converges emerick and reynolds 2013 discussed a set of termination criteria that can be used for the iterative es note that the concept of pilot points plays a key role in the proposed methodology and it connects the ies and ds for handling the inverse problem of non gaussian fields if no pilot points are considered the coupled ies ds comes to the ds alone in other words dynamic data will not be integrated into the mpg simulations on the other hand if all the nodes are pilot points the proposed algorithm becomes the ies and the non gaussian features can not be preserved after data assimilation the pilot points bridge the iterative es and ds for dealing with non gaussianity in data assimilation for better flow and transport modeling 3 a synthetic example a synthetic example is designed to test the performance of this new approach by coupling ds and ies for data assimilation in a bimodal aquifer a 2d transient flow model is considered a time period of 30 days is divided into 60 time steps with a multiplier of 1 05 the aquifer has 50 50 cells and each cell has a size of 5 m 5 m the boundary conditions of the aquifer are simplified as no flow boundaries on the north and south sides and the east side is a constant head boundary h 5 m 50 pumping wells are set on the west boundary the pumping rate of these wells is set to q 3 0 m 3 day at high conductivity cells and q 0 3 m 3 day at low conductivity cells in order to get a prominent change of hydraulic heads at wells 9 observation wells are used to get observed hydraulic head data for inverse modeling fig 2 shows the schematic boundary conditions and the location of observation wells table 1 shows the setting parameters for the synthetic example modflow harbaugh et al 2000 is used to solve the flow eq 1 ds method is used to generate the reference conductivity field see fig 3 the training image fig 4 is obtained by overlaying a continuous hydraulic conductivity field generated by sequential gaussian simulation gómez hernández and journel 1993 on a categorical facies field that has been routinely used to test methodology in fluvial deposits e g li et al 2015 the same training image is used to generate the initial ensemble of conductivity fields via ds for integrating head data seven cases are considered with different numbers of pilot points and ensemble size see table 2 the purpose of these cases is to validate the method and to test the sensitivity of these key parameters to the results fig 5 shows the distribution of pilot points and measured conductivities for case 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydraulic conductivity characterization figs 6 and 7 show the ensemble mean and ensemble variance of conductivity fields for 7 cases that are listed in table 2 for case 1 no measured conductivities and head data are conditioned and ensemble mean and ensemble variance of lnk tend to be constant as expected although each individual realization as the reference conductivity field in fig 3 displays a strong heterogeneity with preferred flow paths the averaging of conductivities through ensemble smears out those high permeable channels in addition since there are no measured hard and soft data that are considered the ensemble variance that represents the uncertainty of hydraulic conductivity shows the highest for case 2 six measured conductivities as hard data are conditioned through ds ensemble mean of conductivity fields displays a pattern that is close to the reference conductivity field in fig 3 and overall ensemble variance is decreased with zero variance at the locations of measured conductivities and gradually elevated variance away from the conditioning points for case 3 besides the measured conductivities head data collected from observation wells are used to update the conductivity ensemble of case 2 the iterative es is applied to update conductivities at all the nodes in other words all the nodes are pilot points and thus no ds is used for interpolation in terms of ensemble mean the pattern is closer to the reference compared with case 2 where only measured conductivities are considered because additional head data are conditioned ensemble variance is further decreased however because only two point geostatistics i e cross covariances are used the pattern in each individual realization can not be preserved which can be found in fig 8 where the histogram of conductivity after updating using iterative es has become a gaussian distribution departing from the bimodal distribution of the reference field in order to preserve the non gaussian feature i e high permeable channels a subset of nodes terms as pilot points is introduced specifically the conductivities at pilot points are updated using head data via iterative es and then ds is further used to extrapolate the updated conductivities at pilot points for other nodes for cases 4 6 the number of pilot points is gradually increased from 14 to 494 while the number of measured conductivities and hydraulic head data are kept the same the ensemble size is 200 for these three cases the ensemble mean and ensemble variance is improved from case 4 to 5 because the elevated number of pilot points from 14 to 94 brings more information from hydraulic head data from case 5 to case 6 the number of pilot point is further increased from 94 to 494 but the ensemble mean and ensemble variance keep the same pattern and uncertainty this means that additional information from pilot points can not improve the estimation and accuracy in contrast the elevated number of pilot points may introduce noises for individual realizations after interpolating by ds in case 6 for case 7 we increased the ensemble size from 200 in case 6 to 500 in case 7 in order to improve the quality of interpolated conductivity realizations ensemble mean and ensemble variance are smoothed because cross covariances are more accurately estimated with the larger ensemble size in the iterative es this is consistent with studies of data assimilation via the enkf e g franssen et al 2009 fig 8 displays the histogram of log conductivity for cases 3 5 and 6 it is evident that if iterative es is used alone the updated conductivity is inclined to be gaussian however when iterative es is coupled with ds via pilot points the bimodal distribution of log conductivity as shown in the reference field can be preserved after conditioning on hydraulic head data using the proposed approach 4 2 hydraulic head besides looking at the characterization of conductivity the reproduction of hydraulic head can also be used to validate the methodology recall piezometric head data from well 1 9 are integrated into the groundwater flow model for calibrating conductivities fig 9 shows the simulated heads for the first 6 cases for well 6 with conditioning on measured conductivities the uncertainty of simulated heads is reduced from case 1 to case 2 with the best estimation of conductivity in case 2 using an ensemble size of 200 the reference head is close to the mean of simulated heads and the spread of simulated heads is the smallest one within the first 6 cases this result is consistent with the characterization of hydraulic conductivity note that the capability of reproducing the reference head depends on how much information data are considered and integrated into the model in these cases only 9 measured conductivities and head data from 9 wells are used to characterize complex patterns that display a high non gaussianity the overall uncertainty of simulated heads still shows a high uncertainty as expected based on bayes rule if additional data such as measured conductivities and head data are conditioned further using the proposed approach its uncertainty will certainly reduced 4 3 transport prediction the main purpose of data assimilation is to improve the predictive capability of the flow and transport model the solute migration is more sensitive to preferred flow paths than hydraulic conductivity in this work a line of contaminant source with a constant concentration is released near the west boundary the total simulation time for the transport migration is 1500 days and the start concentration is 30 mg l porosity is assumed to be 0 3 mt3d zheng and wang 1999 is used to solve the transport eq 2 figs 10 and 11 display the ensemble mean and ensemble variance of plume migration for 7 cases as well as the simulated plume for the reference conductivity field the plume migration of the reference conductivity field clearly shows channel structures which are propagated from the geologic structures of conductivities when including measured conductivities and head data the reproduction of plume migration to the reference one is the best in this work only hydraulic head data collected from 9 monitoring wells are used for conditioning if concentration data are sampled and used for conditioning as well the prediction of plume migration will be considerably improved as it was demonstrated in li et al 2012 5 conclusion in this paper a new approach to assimilate dynamic data into a non gaussian aquifer by coupling the iterative ensemble smoother and multiple point geostatistics method is proposed it borrows the advantages of both ds method in modeling non gaussianity and ies in assimilating dynamic data this new method is aimed at reproducing channelized structures by assimilating indirect data such as hydraulic head a synthetic study has been applied to test the capability of the new approach seven cases are conducted to evaluate this new method among the seven cases the sensitivity of the number of pilot points and ensemble size to the results are evaluated the results show that after combining ds method and iterative es through pilot points hydraulic head data can be successfully assimilated into the non gaussian aquifer as well as preserving the bimodal distribution that is displayed in the conceptual model i e training image the coupled ies ds has a better performance than ies alone since ies is not be able to keep the non gaussian distribution because of the use of two point statistics for estimating correlations between state variables and parameters flow and transport predictions are then introduced to test the predictive capability of the updated conductivities the results show that it can give a better prediction on both hydraulic head and contaminant transport after all the data are integrated into the model and more importantly the non gaussian feature is preserved after assimilating dynamic data the proposed ies ds method provides a new avenue for groundwater inverse modeling in a non gaussian aquifer acknowledgements the first author acknowledges the financial support of the south dakota board of regents through a competitive

criteria that can be used for the iterative es note that the concept of pilot points plays a key role in the proposed methodology and it connects the ies and ds for handling the inverse problem of non gaussian fields if no pilot points are considered the coupled ies ds comes to the ds alone in other words dynamic data will not be integrated into the mpg simulations on the other hand if all the nodes are pilot points the proposed algorithm becomes the ies and the non gaussian features can not be preserved after data assimilation the pilot points bridge the iterative es and ds for dealing with non gaussianity in data assimilation for better flow and transport modeling 3 a synthetic example a synthetic example is designed to test the performance of this new approach by coupling ds and ies for data assimilation in a bimodal aquifer a 2d transient flow model is considered a time period of 30 days is divided into 60 time steps with a multiplier of 1 05 the aquifer has 50 50 cells and each cell has a size of 5 m 5 m the boundary conditions of the aquifer are simplified as no flow boundaries on the north and south sides and the east side is a constant head boundary h 5 m 50 pumping wells are set on the west boundary the pumping rate of these wells is set to q 3 0 m 3 day at high conductivity cells and q 0 3 m 3 day at low conductivity cells in order to get a prominent change of hydraulic heads at wells 9 observation wells are used to get observed hydraulic head data for inverse modeling fig 2 shows the schematic boundary conditions and the location of observation wells table 1 shows the setting parameters for the synthetic example modflow harbaugh et al 2000 is used to solve the flow eq 1 ds method is used to generate the reference conductivity field see fig 3 the training image fig 4 is obtained by overlaying a continuous hydraulic conductivity field generated by sequential gaussian simulation gómez hernández and journel 1993 on a categorical facies field that has been routinely used to test methodology in fluvial deposits e g li et al 2015 the same training image is used to generate the initial ensemble of conductivity fields via ds for integrating head data seven cases are considered with different numbers of pilot points and ensemble size see table 2 the purpose of these cases is to validate the method and to test the sensitivity of these key parameters to the results fig 5 shows the distribution of pilot points and measured conductivities for case 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydraulic conductivity characterization figs 6 and 7 show the ensemble mean and ensemble variance of conductivity fields for 7 cases that are listed in table 2 for case 1 no measured conductivities and head data are conditioned and ensemble mean and ensemble variance of lnk tend to be constant as expected although each individual realization as the reference conductivity field in fig 3 displays a strong heterogeneity with preferred flow paths the averaging of conductivities through ensemble smears out those high permeable channels in addition since there are no measured hard and soft data that are considered the ensemble variance that represents the uncertainty of hydraulic conductivity shows the highest for case 2 six measured conductivities as hard data are conditioned through ds ensemble mean of conductivity fields displays a pattern that is close to the reference conductivity field in fig 3 and overall ensemble variance is decreased with zero variance at the locations of measured conductivities and gradually elevated variance away from the conditioning points for case 3 besides the measured conductivities head data collected from observation wells are used to update the conductivity ensemble of case 2 the iterative es is applied to update conductivities at all the nodes in other words all the nodes are pilot points and thus no ds is used for interpolation in terms of ensemble mean the pattern is closer to the reference compared with case 2 where only measured conductivities are considered because additional head data are conditioned ensemble variance is further decreased however because only two point geostatistics i e cross covariances are used the pattern in each individual realization can not be preserved which can be found in fig 8 where the histogram of conductivity after updating using iterative es has become a gaussian distribution departing from the bimodal distribution of the reference field in order to preserve the non gaussian feature i e high permeable channels a subset of nodes terms as pilot points is introduced specifically the conductivities at pilot points are updated using head data via iterative es and then ds is further used to extrapolate the updated conductivities at pilot points for other nodes for cases 4 6 the number of pilot points is gradually increased from 14 to 494 while the number of measured conductivities and hydraulic head data are kept the same the ensemble size is 200 for these three cases the ensemble mean and ensemble variance is improved from case 4 to 5 because the elevated number of pilot points from 14 to 94 brings more information from hydraulic head data from case 5 to case 6 the number of pilot point is further increased from 94 to 494 but the ensemble mean and ensemble variance keep the same pattern and uncertainty this means that additional information from pilot points can not improve the estimation and accuracy in contrast the elevated number of pilot points may introduce noises for individual realizations after interpolating by ds in case 6 for case 7 we increased the ensemble size from 200 in case 6 to 500 in case 7 in order to improve the quality of interpolated conductivity realizations ensemble mean and ensemble variance are smoothed because cross covariances are more accurately estimated with the larger ensemble size in the iterative es this is consistent with studies of data assimilation via the enkf e g franssen et al 2009 fig 8 displays the histogram of log conductivity for cases 3 5 and 6 it is evident that if iterative es is used alone the updated conductivity is inclined to be gaussian however when iterative es is coupled with ds via pilot points the bimodal distribution of log conductivity as shown in the reference field can be preserved after conditioning on hydraulic head data using the proposed approach 4 2 hydraulic head besides looking at the characterization of conductivity the reproduction of hydraulic head can also be used to validate the methodology recall piezometric head data from well 1 9 are integrated into the groundwater flow model for calibrating conductivities fig 9 shows the simulated heads for the first 6 cases for well 6 with conditioning on measured conductivities the uncertainty of simulated heads is reduced from case 1 to case 2 with the best estimation of conductivity in case 2 using an ensemble size of 200 the reference head is close to the mean of simulated heads and the spread of simulated heads is the smallest one within the first 6 cases this result is consistent with the characterization of hydraulic conductivity note that the capability of reproducing the reference head depends on how much information data are considered and integrated into the model in these cases only 9 measured conductivities and head data from 9 wells are used to characterize complex patterns that display a high non gaussianity the overall uncertainty of simulated heads still shows a high uncertainty as expected based on bayes rule if additional data such as measured conductivities and head data are conditioned further using the proposed approach its uncertainty will certainly reduced 4 3 transport prediction the main purpose of data assimilation is to improve the predictive capability of the flow and transport model the solute migration is more sensitive to preferred flow paths than hydraulic conductivity in this work a line of contaminant source with a constant concentration is released near the west boundary the total simulation time for the transport migration is 1500 days and the start concentration is 30 mg l porosity is assumed to be 0 3 mt3d zheng and wang 1999 is used to solve the transport eq 2 figs 10 and 11 display the ensemble mean and ensemble variance of plume migration for 7 cases as well as the simulated plume for the reference conductivity field the plume migration of the reference conductivity field clearly shows channel structures which are propagated from the geologic structures of conductivities when including measured conductivities and head data the reproduction of plume migration to the reference one is the best in this work only hydraulic head data collected from 9 monitoring wells are used for conditioning if concentration data are sampled and used for conditioning as well the prediction of plume migration will be considerably improved as it was demonstrated in li et al 2012 5 conclusion in this paper a new approach to assimilate dynamic data into a non gaussian aquifer by coupling the iterative ensemble smoother and multiple point geostatistics method is proposed it borrows the advantages of both ds method in modeling non gaussianity and ies in assimilating dynamic data this new method is aimed at reproducing channelized structures by assimilating indirect data such as hydraulic head a synthetic study has been applied to test the capability of the new approach seven cases are conducted to evaluate this new method among the seven cases the sensitivity of the number of pilot points and ensemble size to the results are evaluated the results show that after combining ds method and iterative es through pilot points hydraulic head data can be successfully assimilated into the non gaussian aquifer as well as preserving the bimodal distribution that is displayed in the conceptual model i e training image the coupled ies ds has a better performance than ies alone since ies is not be able to keep the non gaussian distribution because of the use of two point statistics for estimating correlations between state variables and parameters flow and transport predictions are then introduced to test the predictive capability of the updated conductivities the results show that it can give a better prediction on both hydraulic head and contaminant transport after all the data are integrated into the model and more importantly the non gaussian feature is preserved after assimilating dynamic data the proposed ies ds method provides a new avenue for groundwater inverse modeling in a non gaussian aquifer acknowledgements the first author acknowledges the financial support of the south dakota board of regents through a competitive

7014,the one dimensional advective dispersive reactive transport equation has been widely applied to describe the transportation process of landfill leachate through liners or anti seepage curtains however most existing methods solving this problem are limited to simple initial conditions in order to eliminate these limitations homotopy analysis method ham is implemented to solve the contaminant transport model in this paper applying auxiliary linear and nonlinear operator zero order deformation equation is developed to solve contaminant transport problems numerically with smooth initial conditions and variable source concentration being considered ham has been applied to simulate different contamination transport problems in one dimensional space reported in literature good agreement between ham solutions and analytical solutions has been achieved for all cases considered demonstrating the feasibility of ham to solve the contaminant transport model with more general smooth initial conditions keywords homotopy analysis method contaminant transport initial condition 1 introduction over the last two decades the rapid development of urbanization in china has inevitably resulted in the increasing production of a large quantity of municipal solid waste msw thereby posing a great challenge for the development of waste disposal technology chen et al 2005 chen 2014 lei et al 2018 yu et al 2018 landfills with engineered clay liners have been widely used worldwide and have proved to be a reliable technology in terms of long term performance to mitigate the potential risks associated with waste disposal rowe 2005 optimal design of modern landfills requires an in depth understanding of fundamental mechanisms involved in contaminant migration in clay liner and the development of mathematical models which are capable of making quantitative predictions of the liner performance malusis and shackelford 2004 rowe 1987 1989 rowe 2005 rowe and booker 1986 yong et al 1992 the key factors governing contaminant transport in clay liners are advection dispersion diffusion and chemical reaction associated with sorption and desorption processes for many practical situations these mechanisms can be mathematically described by the advective dispersive reactive referred to as adr contaminant transport equation rowe 1987 rowe 2005 yong et al 1992 in some cases associated with organic wastes biodegradation may play an important role in the contaminant transport producing either more toxic or less harmful reactants chen 2014 in addition the decay chain reaction may occur in the case of radioactive waste disposal gustavious and david 2008 to take into account the biodegradation or decay reaction an addition sink term should be incorporated into the adr contaminant transport equation leading to a general reactive transport model bear and cheng 2008 for most practical purposes with respect to landfill design modelling the contaminant transport can be simplified to solve the general adr transport equation in one dimension which has been proved to be adequate due to its simplicity rowe 2005 depending on the specific practical applications the general 1 d reactive transport equation can be further simplified by neglecting the advection or sorption desorption or decay term or a combination thereof in consequence a class of simplified 1 d contaminant transport models have been proposed and studied chen et al 2009 malusis and shackelford 2004 rowe and booker 1985 shackelford and daniel 1991a b with considering different initial and boundary conditions those models have been solved by using either analytical or numerical techniques see review by van genuchten and alves 1982 yong et al 1992 and bear and cheng 2008 although numerical models are flexible in dealing with complex and heterogeneous contaminant migration problems but analytical or semi analytical solutions are still of great importance since they can provide efficient tools for evaluating numerical solutions and performing the sensitivity analysis chen et al 2012 vanderborght et al 2005 this study is concerned with the latter up to date many analytical solutions have been available in the literature for solving the reactive contaminant transport equation the common mathematical tools used for obtaining these solutions are laplace or fourier transform methods leij et al 1991 leij et al 1993 leij and van genuchten 1995 li and cleall 2010 2011 philip 1994 rowe and booker 1985 toride et al 1993 van genuchten and alves 1982 or generalized integral transform technique pérez guerrero et al 2009a or differential transformation chen and ju 2004 as well as the combination of laplace transform and generalized integral transform chen and liu 2011 for the derivation of those analytical solutions one of key elements is the consideration of inlet and outlet boundary conditions the former needs to account for different patterns of concentration variation at inlet boundary such as time dependent conditions chen and liu 2011 golz and dorroh 2001 pérez guerrero et al 2013 or a pulse condition ziskind et al 2011 as well as periodic boundary conditions logan and zlotnik 1995 in contrast the latter needs to be adapted for semi infinite or finite spatial domain in addition to the analytical solutions developed for a single species transport in a single layered system more complex analytical solutions have been recently proposed for multi species transport in a single layered system chen et al 2012 pérez guerrero et al 2009b or a single specie transport in a multi layered system chen et al 2009 leij and van genuchten 1995 liu 1998 rowe and booker 1986 compared to the aforementioned analytical solutions it appears that much less attention has been paid on semi analytical solutions despite its capability to take into account the more complex governing laws for contaminant transport such as nonlinear sorption frolkovič and kačur 2006 this study aims to mitigating the gap attempting to propose a semi analytical solution of the 1 d general reactive transport model homotopy analysis method ham is a general analytical approximation method for highly nonlinear problems recently developed by liao 1992 2004 this method has been adopted to solve a variety of nonlinear problems associated with blasius viscous flow or hydromechanics and so on liao 1995 2005 liao et al 2006 liao 2004 it has been proved to have numerous advantages than the traditional mathematical techniques i simplicity for the mathematical derivation without involving complex theory ii allowing extremely large freedom to choose equation type of linear sub problems basic function of solution and initial guess and thereby iii a convenient way to obtain approximate solutions with high accuracy and to guarantee the convergence of solutions therefore this study attempts to apply ham to solve the one dimensional reactive transport equation with considering first order decay source and linear sorption isotherm to derive the semi analytical solution general boundary conditions with source concentration attenuation are considered since it is the common inlet boundary condition occurring at the top surface of clay liner rowe and booker 1986 2 theoretical background of ham we consider the following differential equations 1 n i c i x t 0 where n i are nonlinear operators that represent the whole equations x and t denote the independent variables and c i x t are unknown functions selecting the auxiliary linear operator l by means of generalizing the traditional homotopy method the so called zero order differential equations are constructed as follows 2 1 q i l ϕ i x t q i c i 0 x t q i ħ i n i ϕ i x t q i where q i 0 1 is an embedding parameter ħ i 0 are nonzero auxiliary functions l is an auxiliary linear operator c i 0 x t are initial guesses of c i x t and ϕ i x t q are unknown functions it is important to note that one has great freedom to choose auxiliary objects such as ħ i and l in ham obviously when q 0 and q 1 one has 3 ϕ i x t 0 c i 0 x t ϕ i x t 1 c i x t thus as q increases from 0 to 1 the solution ϕ i x t q varies from the initial guesses ci 0 x t to the solution c i x t expanding ϕ i x t q in taylor series with respect to q 4 ϕ i x t q ϕ i x t 0 m 1 m ϕ i x t q m q m q 0 q m where 5 c i m x t m ϕ i x t q m q m q 0 and 6 ϕ i x t q c i 0 x t m 1 c i m x t q m because it converges at q 1 7 c i x t c i 0 x t m 1 c i m x t if the auxiliary linear operator the initial guesses the auxiliary parameters ħ i and the auxiliary functions are properly chosen eq 7 must be one of the solutions of original nonlinear equations as proved by liao et al 2006 eq 7 shows the correspondence between initial guess solutions and exact solutions by c i m x t c i m x t can be determined by higher order differential equation differentiating eq 2 m times with respect to the embedding parameter q then setting q 0 and finally dividing them by m the so called mth order deformation equations can be obtained 8 l c i m x t χ m c i m 1 x t ħ i r i m c i m 1 x t where 9 r i m c i m 1 x t 1 m 1 m 1 n i ϕ i x t q q m 1 q 0 and 10 χ m 0 m 1 1 m 1 simultaneously inverse on both sides of eq 8 one has 11 c i m x t χ m c i m 1 x t ħ i l 1 r i m c i m 1 x t if the auxiliary linear operator the initial guesses the auxiliary parameters ħ i and the auxiliary functions are properly chosen eq 1 can be easily solved the m th order approximate solution of c i x t is 12 c i x t m 0 m c i m x t ħ i plays a role in controlling and regulating the convergence of series solutions and ħ i is determined by ħ i curve nevertheless ħ i curve just displays the selected region of ħ i the best ħ i can be selected by applying the minimum of the residual error square technique proposed by liao 2010 the squared residual error of the governing differential equation is defined as 13 e n ħ ω n m 0 n c m x y t 2 d x d y 3 application of ham to reactive transport model with a constant dispersion coefficient in this section ham has been applied to solve i a simplified 1d single species transport model with more general smooth initial conditions and neglecting the sorption sink term and ii a general 1d reactive transport model with contaminant concentration attenuation being adopted at the inlet boundary in both cases a constant dispersion coefficient has been assumed the feasibility of ham is evaluated by comparing semi analytical solutions reproduced by ham and analytical solutions proposed by simpson and ellery 2014 3 1 semi analytical solution to non reactive transport model with first order decay 3 1 1 governing equations herein we consider a problem of one dimensional advective dispersive contaminant transport with first order decay source in a semi infinite spatial domain which can be mathematically described by the following equation bear and cheng 2008 14 c t d 2 c x 2 v c x k c 0 x t 0 where c x t mg cm 3 is the contaminant concentration at a distance x cm away from source in time t h d cm2 h 1 is dispersion coefficient v cm h 1 is darcy velocity k h 1 is contaminant decay constant general initial condition is considered 15 c x 0 a x e b x in which a is the initial background concentration of contaminant and b is the concentration coefficient inlet and outlet boundary conditions are 16 c 0 t 0 lim x c x t 0 where c x 0 a x e b x is applied for the description of a specific initial condition within the analytical domain representing a pre existing plume of c x t according to simpson and ellery 2014 3 1 2 derivation of the semi analytical solution the initial approximations are chosen according to initial conditions 17 c x t a x e b x the linear operator for ham analysis is expressed by 18 l ψ x t q ψ x t q t considering the following property 18a l j 0 where j is an integral constant furthermore eq 14 suggests that a system of nonlinear operators can be defined as 19 n ψ x t q ψ t d ψ 2 x 2 v ψ x k ψ using the above definition the zeroth order differential equations are constructed 20 1 q l ψ c 0 x t q ħ n ψ x t q obviously when q 0 and q 1 21 ψ x t 0 c 0 x t ψ x t 1 c x t therefore as the embedding parameter q increases from 0 to 1 ψ x t q varies from the initial guess c 0 x t to c x t expanding ψ x t q in taylor series with respect to q yields 22 ψ x t q ψ x t 0 m 1 c m x t q m if the auxiliary linear operator the initial guesses and the auxiliary parameters are properly chosen the above series is convergent at q 1 thus leading to 23 c x t c 0 x t m 1 c m x t which must be one of the solutions of eq 14 differentiating eq 20 m times with respect to the embedding parameter q then setting q 0 and finally dividing them by m the so called mth order deformation equations are 24 l c m x t χ m c m 1 x t ħ r m c m 1 x t where 25 r m c m 1 c m 1 t d 2 c m 1 x 2 v c m 1 x k c m 1 with initial conditions 26 c m x 0 0 the solution of the m th order deformation eq 24 for m 1 can be expressed as 27 c m x t χ m c m 1 x t ħ 0 t r m c m 1 x τ d τ j where j is determined by initial conditions set by eq 26 thus one has 28 c m x t χ m c m 1 ħ 0 t c m 1 τ d 2 c m 1 x 2 v c m 1 x k c m 1 d τ thus approximate solutions by ham can be successively obtained 29a c 0 x t a x e b x 29b c 1 x t ħ t v a e b x a b x e b x d 2 a b e b x a b 2 x e b x a x k e b x liao 1995 has proved that if the series solution of eq 23 converges it must be the solution of eq 14 thus it is very important to ensure the convergence of the series solution the convergence region can be easily adjusted and controlled by auxiliary parameters ħ in homotopy analysis method in general the auxiliary parameters ħ can be selected by plotting ħ curve the ħ curve of ctt x t is shown in fig 1 which indicates that it is a horizontal line between 2 and 2 thus the series solution converges when ħ falls into the range from 2 to 2 the best ħ can be selected by the minimum of the squared residual error of the governing differential equation see eq 13 with ħ 0 2 being taken in this case 3 1 3 numerical results and discussion model parameters adopted by previous case study simpson and ellery 2014 are adopted for model validation d 0 5 cm2 h 1 v 0 2 cm h 1 k 0 05 h 1 a 2 and b 0 0025 the resulting ham solutions with different orders are compared with exact solutions simpson and ellery 2014 at t 20 h in fig 2 a as can be seen the approximate solution with the fifth order is in good agreement with exact analytical solution demonstrating the efficiency of ham solution and its convergence rate this also indicates that the proposed semi analytical solution is capable to solve one dimensional advective dispersive contaminant transport model with first order

sorption and first order decay is considered in this section a general boundary condition with exponential attenuation of source contaminant concentration is taken into account to derive the semi analytical solution the general reactive transport model can be expressed as 30 r c x t t d 2 c x t x 2 v c x t x k c x t where c x t mg cm 3 is the contaminant concentration in a specific depth x cm

ellery 2014 in fig 3 good agreement between ham solutions and analytical solutions has been achieved for all cases considered which demonstrates the capacity of ham to solve reactive transport model with first order decay 4 application of ham to advection dispersion transport equation ade with time dependent transport coefficients in this section two examples are considered to show the effectiveness of ham applied in one dimensional ades where the hydrodynamic dispersion is time dependent with exponential variation 4 1 semi analytical solutions for ade without decay effects 4 1 1 governing equations and boundary conditions a 1 d ade for the description of advection dispersion and linear equilibrium sorption is studied in this section this model considers a variable dispersion

the increasing decay coefficient in shallow areas and approaches a steady state in deep zones this indicates that the effects of decay coefficient can be ignored in deep areas 5 conclusions one dimensional contaminant transport model with more general and smooth initial conditions was solved through homotopy analysis method ham applying auxiliary linear and nonlinear operator and selecting initial guesses and auxiliary parameters auxiliary functions were properly developed the effective region for ham solution was obtained by plotting ħ curve which provided a convenient way to control

7014,the one dimensional advective dispersive reactive transport equation has been widely applied to describe the transportation process of landfill leachate through liners or anti seepage curtains however most existing methods solving this problem are limited to simple initial conditions in order to eliminate these limitations homotopy analysis method ham is implemented to solve the contaminant transport model in this paper applying auxiliary linear and nonlinear operator zero order deformation equation is developed to solve contaminant transport problems numerically with smooth initial conditions and variable source concentration being considered ham has been applied to simulate different contamination transport problems in one dimensional space reported in literature good agreement between ham solutions and analytical solutions has been achieved for all cases considered demonstrating the feasibility of ham to solve the contaminant transport model with more general smooth initial conditions keywords homotopy analysis method contaminant transport initial condition 1 introduction over the last two decades the rapid development of urbanization in china has inevitably resulted in the increasing production of a large quantity of municipal solid waste msw thereby posing a great challenge for the development of waste disposal technology chen et al 2005 chen 2014 lei et al 2018 yu et al 2018 landfills with engineered clay liners have been widely used worldwide and have proved to be a reliable technology in terms of long term performance to mitigate the potential risks associated with waste disposal rowe 2005 optimal design of modern landfills requires an in depth understanding of fundamental mechanisms involved in contaminant migration in clay liner and the development of mathematical models which are capable of making quantitative predictions of the liner performance malusis and shackelford 2004 rowe 1987 1989 rowe 2005 rowe and booker 1986 yong et al 1992 the key factors governing contaminant transport in clay liners are advection dispersion diffusion and chemical reaction associated with sorption and desorption processes for many practical situations these mechanisms can be mathematically described by the advective dispersive reactive referred to as adr contaminant transport equation rowe 1987 rowe 2005 yong et al 1992 in some cases associated with organic wastes biodegradation may play an important role in the contaminant transport producing either more toxic or less harmful reactants chen 2014 in addition the decay chain reaction may occur in the case of radioactive waste disposal gustavious and david 2008 to take into account the biodegradation or decay reaction an addition sink term should be incorporated into the adr contaminant transport equation leading to a general reactive transport model bear and cheng 2008 for most practical purposes with respect to landfill design modelling the contaminant transport can be simplified to solve the general adr transport equation in one dimension which has been proved to be adequate due to its simplicity rowe 2005 depending on the specific practical applications the general 1 d reactive transport equation can be further simplified by neglecting the advection or sorption desorption or decay term or a combination thereof in consequence a class of simplified 1 d contaminant transport models have been proposed and studied chen et al 2009 malusis and shackelford 2004 rowe and booker 1985 shackelford and daniel 1991a b with considering different initial and boundary conditions those models have been solved by using either analytical or numerical techniques see review by van genuchten and alves 1982 yong et al 1992 and bear and cheng 2008 although numerical models are flexible in dealing with complex and heterogeneous contaminant migration problems but analytical or semi analytical solutions are still of great importance since they can provide efficient tools for evaluating numerical solutions and performing the sensitivity analysis chen et al 2012 vanderborght et al 2005 this study is concerned with the latter up to date many analytical solutions have been available in the literature for solving the reactive contaminant transport equation the common mathematical tools used for obtaining these solutions are laplace or fourier transform methods leij et al 1991 leij et al 1993 leij and van genuchten 1995 li and cleall 2010 2011 philip 1994 rowe and booker 1985 toride et al 1993 van genuchten and alves 1982 or generalized integral transform technique pérez guerrero et al 2009a or differential transformation chen and ju 2004 as well as the combination of laplace transform and generalized integral transform chen and liu 2011 for the derivation of those analytical solutions one of key elements is the consideration of inlet and outlet boundary conditions the former needs to account for different patterns of concentration variation at inlet boundary such as time dependent conditions chen and liu 2011 golz and dorroh 2001 pérez guerrero et al 2013 or a pulse condition ziskind et al 2011 as well as periodic boundary conditions logan and zlotnik 1995 in contrast the latter needs to be adapted for semi infinite or finite spatial domain in addition to the analytical solutions developed for a single species transport in a single layered system more complex analytical solutions have been recently proposed for multi species transport in a single layered system chen et al 2012 pérez guerrero et al 2009b or a single specie transport in a multi layered system chen et al 2009 leij and van genuchten 1995 liu 1998 rowe and booker 1986 compared to the aforementioned analytical solutions it appears that much less attention has been paid on semi analytical solutions despite its capability to take into account the more complex governing laws for contaminant transport such as nonlinear sorption frolkovič and kačur 2006 this study aims to mitigating the gap attempting to propose a semi analytical solution of the 1 d general reactive transport model homotopy analysis method ham is a general analytical approximation method for highly nonlinear problems recently developed by liao 1992 2004 this method has been adopted to solve a variety of nonlinear problems associated with blasius viscous flow or hydromechanics and so on liao 1995 2005 liao et al 2006 liao 2004 it has been proved to have numerous advantages than the traditional mathematical techniques i simplicity for the mathematical derivation without involving complex theory ii allowing extremely large freedom to choose equation type of linear sub problems basic function of solution and initial guess and thereby iii a convenient way to obtain approximate solutions with high accuracy and to guarantee the convergence of solutions therefore this study attempts to apply ham to solve the one dimensional reactive transport equation with considering first order decay source and linear sorption isotherm to derive the semi analytical solution general boundary conditions with source concentration attenuation are considered since it is the common inlet boundary condition occurring at the top surface of clay liner rowe and booker 1986 2 theoretical background of ham we consider the following differential equations 1 n i c i x t 0 where n i are nonlinear operators that represent the whole equations x and t denote the independent variables and c i x t are unknown functions selecting the auxiliary linear operator l by means of generalizing the traditional homotopy method the so called zero order differential equations are constructed as follows 2 1 q i l ϕ i x t q i c i 0 x t q i ħ i n i ϕ i x t q i where q i 0 1 is an embedding parameter ħ i 0 are nonzero auxiliary functions l is an auxiliary linear operator c i 0 x t are initial guesses of c i x t and ϕ i x t q are unknown functions it is important to note that one has great freedom to choose auxiliary objects such as ħ i and l in ham obviously when q 0 and q 1 one has 3 ϕ i x t 0 c i 0 x t ϕ i x t 1 c i x t thus as q increases from 0 to 1 the solution ϕ i x t q varies from the initial guesses ci 0 x t to the solution c i x t expanding ϕ i x t q in taylor series with respect to q 4 ϕ i x t q ϕ i x t 0 m 1 m ϕ i x t q m q m q 0 q m where 5 c i m x t m ϕ i x t q m q m q 0 and 6 ϕ i x t q c i 0 x t m 1 c i m x t q m because it converges at q 1 7 c i x t c i 0 x t m 1 c i m x t if the auxiliary linear operator the initial guesses the auxiliary parameters ħ i and the auxiliary functions are properly chosen eq 7 must be one of the solutions of original nonlinear equations as proved by liao et al 2006 eq 7 shows the correspondence between initial guess solutions and exact solutions by c i m x t c i m x t can be determined by higher order differential equation differentiating eq 2 m times with respect to the embedding parameter q then setting q 0 and finally dividing them by m the so called mth order deformation equations can be obtained 8 l c i m x t χ m c i m 1 x t ħ i r i m c i m 1 x t where 9 r i m c i m 1 x t 1 m 1 m 1 n i ϕ i x t q q m 1 q 0 and 10 χ m 0 m 1 1 m 1 simultaneously inverse on both sides of eq 8 one has 11 c i m x t χ m c i m 1 x t ħ i l 1 r i m c i m 1 x t if the auxiliary linear operator the initial guesses the auxiliary parameters ħ i and the auxiliary functions are properly chosen eq 1 can be easily solved the m th order approximate solution of c i x t is 12 c i x t m 0 m c i m x t ħ i plays a role in controlling and regulating the convergence of series solutions and ħ i is determined by ħ i curve nevertheless ħ i curve just displays the selected region of ħ i the best ħ i can be selected by applying the minimum of the residual error square technique proposed by liao 2010 the squared residual error of the governing differential equation is defined as 13 e n ħ ω n m 0 n c m x y t 2 d x d y 3 application of ham to reactive transport model with a constant dispersion coefficient in this section ham has been applied to solve i a simplified 1d single species transport model with more general smooth initial conditions and neglecting the sorption sink term and ii a general 1d reactive transport model with contaminant concentration attenuation being adopted at the inlet boundary in both cases a constant dispersion coefficient has been assumed the feasibility of ham is evaluated by comparing semi analytical solutions reproduced by ham and analytical solutions proposed by simpson and ellery 2014 3 1 semi analytical solution to non reactive transport model with first order decay 3 1 1 governing equations herein we consider a problem of one dimensional advective dispersive contaminant transport with first order decay source in a semi infinite spatial domain which can be mathematically described by the following equation bear and cheng 2008 14 c t d 2 c x 2 v c x k c 0 x t 0 where c x t mg cm 3 is the contaminant concentration at a distance x cm away from source in time t h d cm2 h 1 is dispersion coefficient v cm h 1 is darcy velocity k h 1 is contaminant decay constant general initial condition is considered 15 c x 0 a x e b x in which a is the initial background concentration of contaminant and b is the concentration coefficient inlet and outlet boundary conditions are 16 c 0 t 0 lim x c x t 0 where c x 0 a x e b x is applied for the description of a specific initial condition within the analytical domain representing a pre existing plume of c x t according to simpson and ellery 2014 3 1 2 derivation of the semi analytical solution the initial approximations are chosen according to initial conditions 17 c x t a x e b x the linear operator for ham analysis is expressed by 18 l ψ x t q ψ x t q t considering the following property 18a l j 0 where j is an integral constant furthermore eq 14 suggests that a system of nonlinear operators can be defined as 19 n ψ x t q ψ t d ψ 2 x 2 v ψ x k ψ using the above definition the zeroth order differential equations are constructed 20 1 q l ψ c 0 x t q ħ n ψ x t q obviously when q 0 and q 1 21 ψ x t 0 c 0 x t ψ x t 1 c x t therefore as the embedding parameter q increases from 0 to 1 ψ x t q varies from the initial guess c 0 x t to c x t expanding ψ x t q in taylor series with respect to q yields 22 ψ x t q ψ x t 0 m 1 c m x t q m if the auxiliary linear operator the initial guesses and the auxiliary parameters are properly chosen the above series is convergent at q 1 thus leading to 23 c x t c 0 x t m 1 c m x t which must be one of the solutions of eq 14 differentiating eq 20 m times with respect to the embedding parameter q then setting q 0 and finally dividing them by m the so called mth order deformation equations are 24 l c m x t χ m c m 1 x t ħ r m c m 1 x t where 25 r m c m 1 c m 1 t d 2 c m 1 x 2 v c m 1 x k c m 1 with initial conditions 26 c m x 0 0 the solution of the m th order deformation eq 24 for m 1 can be expressed as 27 c m x t χ m c m 1 x t ħ 0 t r m c m 1 x τ d τ j where j is determined by initial conditions set by eq 26 thus one has 28 c m x t χ m c m 1 ħ 0 t c m 1 τ d 2 c m 1 x 2 v c m 1 x k c m 1 d τ thus approximate solutions by ham can be successively obtained 29a c 0 x t a x e b x 29b c 1 x t ħ t v a e b x a b x e b x d 2 a b e b x a b 2 x e b x a x k e b x liao 1995 has proved that if the series solution of eq 23 converges it must be the solution of eq 14 thus it is very important to ensure the convergence of the series solution the convergence region can be easily adjusted and controlled by auxiliary parameters ħ in homotopy analysis method in general the auxiliary parameters ħ can be selected by plotting ħ curve the ħ curve of ctt x t is shown in fig 1 which indicates that it is a horizontal line between 2 and 2 thus the series solution converges when ħ falls into the range from 2 to 2 the best ħ can be selected by the minimum of the squared residual error of the governing differential equation see eq 13 with ħ 0 2 being taken in this case 3 1 3 numerical results and discussion model parameters adopted by previous case study simpson and ellery 2014 are adopted for model validation d 0 5 cm2 h 1 v 0 2 cm h 1 k 0 05 h 1 a 2 and b 0 0025 the resulting ham solutions with different orders are compared with exact solutions simpson and ellery 2014 at t 20 h in fig 2 a as can be seen the approximate solution with the fifth order is in good agreement with exact analytical solution demonstrating the efficiency of ham solution and its convergence rate this also indicates that the proposed semi analytical solution is capable to solve one dimensional advective dispersive contaminant transport model with first order

sorption and first order decay is considered in this section a general boundary condition with exponential attenuation of source contaminant concentration is taken into account to derive the semi analytical solution the general reactive transport model can be expressed as 30 r c x t t d 2 c x t x 2 v c x t x k c x t where c x t mg cm 3 is the contaminant concentration in a specific depth x cm

ellery 2014 in fig 3 good agreement between ham solutions and analytical solutions has been achieved for all cases considered which demonstrates the capacity of ham to solve reactive transport model with first order decay 4 application of ham to advection dispersion transport equation ade with time dependent transport coefficients in this section two examples are considered to show the effectiveness of ham applied in one dimensional ades where the hydrodynamic dispersion is time dependent with exponential variation 4 1 semi analytical solutions for ade without decay effects 4 1 1 governing equations and boundary conditions a 1 d ade for the description of advection dispersion and linear equilibrium sorption is studied in this section this model considers a variable dispersion

distribution profiles of contaminant concentration at different time intervals are plotted in fig 4 b which demonstrates that ham is straightforward and concise to solve one dimensional contaminant

a steady state in deep areas contaminant concentration profiles with three decay coefficients k 0 0462 0 139 and 0 8 a 1 are reproduced in fig 5 b as observed contaminant concentration decreases with the increasing decay coefficient in shallow areas and approaches a steady state in deep zones this indicates that the effects of decay coefficient can be ignored in deep areas 5 conclusions one dimensional contaminant transport model with more general and smooth initial conditions was solved through homotopy analysis method ham applying auxiliary linear and nonlinear operator and selecting initial guesses and auxiliary parameters auxiliary functions were properly developed the effective region for ham solution was obtained by plotting ħ curve which provided a convenient way to control
