4960,qinghai lake qhl the largest saline lake in china is located in the tibetan plateau the lake plays an important role in regional water and nutrient cycles and the sustenance of semi arid ecosystem functions over the past half century the lake experienced substantial changes in its water level in a seesaw pattern in the first 35 years the lake level presented a dramatic continual decrease of 2 63 m then a reversed upward tendency appears beginning the early 21st century the water level in the recent years has recovered to the stage from 50 years ago around 1970 however the driving factor causing the seesaw pattern changes remains to be unclearly understood the goal of this study is to investigate the abnormal changes in the water level of the qhl from 1970 to 2018 and explore the primary contributor of the reversed shifts by taking the climate driving view then we discuss the possible atmospheric circulations that are tightly associated with the climate variables over the qhl catchment and its surroundings results show that the rapid water level recovery of the qhl in recent years is attributable to the substantial increases in water levels in several key abnormal wet years of 2005 2012 2015 and 2017 2018 the lake level variations coincide with annual precipitation rather than temperature and evaporation besides this study reveals that the atmospheric water vapor flux in the qhl basin is mainly transported from the west and southwest to the east for the anomalous high precipitation wet years the total water vapor of the qhl basin increases significantly the enso and other atmospheric circulation factors may be related to the precipitation variations that drive the water vapor transport of the qhl basin keywords qinghai lake climate

terrestrial surface lehner and döll 2004 messager et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 verpoorter et al 2014 moreover lakes not only are an essential component of the global hydrological biogeochemical and ecological processes pace and prairie 2004 sobek et al 2003 verpoorter et al 2014 but they also support at least 100 000 different species dudgeon 2005 and provides considerable services to human beings including drinking water supply agricultural production transportation recreation and fisheries alsdorf et al 2007 grill et al 2019 lehner and döll 2004 yamazaki et al 2019 however despite the universal importance of inland lake dynamics our understanding about this topic remains limited climate change and human activities e g water diversion and land cover change have led to significant changes in the inundation area water level and water storage of lakes tao et al 2020 especially during the recent several decades many large lakes or lake clusters have experienced significant dynamic changes for instance many lakes in dry endorheic basins have lost majority of their water due to human activities such as river water diversion and unregulated withdrawal pekel et al 2016 wang and ma 2018 wang et al 2018a including those in the aral sea micklin 1988 the great salt lake wurtsbaugh et al 2017 and the lake chad coe and birkett 2004 gao et al 2011 by contrast most lakes on the tibetan plateau tp hereinafter and some arctic thermokarst ponds have shown significant expansions in the recent two decades due to the changing climate phan et al 2012 roy leveillee and burn 2017 zhang et al

climate changes kang et al 2010 liu and chen 2000 yang et al 2014 2011 e g the rise in temperature and change in precipitation and evaporation which greatly reshaped its surrounding environment the dramatic expansion of lakes undoubtedly is one of the most significant characteristics of environmental changes on the tp lei et al 2014 song et al 2013 2014a zhang et al 2011 many literatures have documented the rapid expansion of inundated area water level increases and substantial volume accumulations of the tibetan lakes crétaux et al 2016 kropáček et al 2012 lei et al 2014 2013 li et al 2011a 2019a phan et al 2012 qiao et al 2017 song et al 2013 treichler et al 2019 yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 2017a zhu et al 2010 qinghai lake qhl hereinafter as the largest lake of china is located in the northeast part of the tp similar to most of the other lakes in the tp the qhl belongs to the closed lake type without any outflow draining to the rivers compared with open lakes regulated by inflows outflows closed lakes in the basin are more sensitive to changes in regional water budget many prior studies have reported that the qhl showed significant shrinkage during the last several decades of the 20th century followed by rapid growths since the early 21st century dong and song 2011 li et al 2007 wan et al 2014 yuan et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 as these tibetan lakes are located in high altitude and remote endorheic drainage system with minimal human interventions their dynamics represent the combined effects of climate changes and cryosphere responses the qhl is located in the intersection of the east asian monsoon the indian monsoon and the westerly jet stream cui and li 2015 zhang et al 2011 suggesting a complex climate driving mechanism of the lake s dynamics most previous studies have consensually agreed that the lasting shrinkage could be attributed to the increased lake evaporation beyond the decreased precipitation recharge rate as well as the rapid rising air temperatures after the mid 20th century however the reversed growth tendency in the recent years could be associated with multiple factors including the increased warming induced meltwater and dry to wet hydrological transitions locally dong and song 2011 jin and feng 2013 shi et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 reported that snow meltwater contributed to basin scale runoff at 13 proportion and suggested its insignificant influence on lake level variations in general the dominant driving factor of the recent remarkable expansion of the qhl still remains largely uncertain a major reason may lie in that most previous reports focus on the attribution of most previous reports to the long term tendency of lake growths rather than the abnormal changes in the water area and level of the qhl in certain key hydrological years consequently the main objectives of this study is to 1 identify the characteristics of lake level variations in certain abnormal hydrological years and subsequently quantify the contributing factors of those years to the lake s reversed growth tendency since the early 2000s based on the combined analysis of in situ gauge measured water level and satellite altimetry data 2 examine the associations of abnormal lake level shifts by using key climate variables in these abnormal years and 3 further determine the possible atmospheric circulations dominating the local climate variables over the qhl basin and its surroundings the results would contribute to advancing our understanding of the driving mechanism of the recent dramatic growths of the qhl and other tp lakes and hydrological cycles under future climate change scenarios moreover the results can broaden our perspective on the linkage of the between atmospheric circulation and precipitation 2 study area the qhl is located in the southeast of the lake s basin 36 32 37 15 n 99 36 100 16 e with the area of approximately 4472 73 km2 and the water level of 3196 18 m as measured in 2018 which is the largest saline lake in china the qhl was formed by the collapse of the datong mountains in the northern the qilian mountains and the riyue mountain in the south and the qinghai nan mountains dong et al 2019 zheng 1997 the main inflow rivers include the buha river the shaliu river the hargai river the uha aran river and the heima river yi et al 2010b the total runoff of these rivers comprises approximately 86 of the surface runoff into the lake among them the buha river and shaliu river account for approximately 64 of the total runoff ding et al 2018 the lake s location in the intersection zone of the eastern asian monsoon region the northwest arid region and the tp alpine region has led to obvious regional climate characteristics such as dry and cold little rain windy strong solar radiation and large diurnal temperature of 10 the semi arid alpine climate is typical in the plateau yi et al 2010b from the middle of the 20th century to the early 21st century the regional temperature has increased by 1 the evaporation on the surface has increased by 200 mm and the lake water level has decreased by 3 m dong et al 2019 li and cui 2016 li et al 2007 3 material and methodology 3 1 legos altimetry and in situ gauged lake level datasets since the late 1980s several satellite altimetry missions have been launched including geosat 1986 1988 ers 1 1991 1996 topex poseidon 1992 2005 ers 2 1995 present gfo 2000 2008 jason 1 2001 present jason2 2008 present and envisat 2002 present crétaux et al 2016 the combined altimetry datasets can provide measurements of more than two decades of history of the earth s surface elevations and are expected to be continuously updated over the next decade the laboratoire d études en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos altimetry data set for the period of 1995 2018 were downloaded from http hydroweb theia land fr the datasets have passed various classical corrections such as orbit ionospheric and tropospheric corrections polar and solid earth tides and sea state bias crétaux et al 2011 the legos altimetry datasets were used to derive the mean value of all the water level measurements during a year the in situ gauged lake level data for the qhl from 1970 to 2014 were obtained from the average of two hydrological stations namely shatuosi and xiashe in this study the overlapping period 1995 2014 of the legos altimetry data and the in situ gauged lake level data was fitted then the annual lake level of qhl from 1970 to 2018 was reconstructed according to the fitting relationship 3 2 meteorological data twenty five meteorological stations with relatively high impact on the qhl basin were selected to examine the associations of the lake water level with the key climate variables and the response of the climate variables to the large scale atmospheric circulation the distribution of the meteorological stations around the qhl basin is shown in fig 1 in this study we obtained daily temperature precipitation and evaporation data for the period of 2004 2018 from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn the dataset passed strict quality control including the uniformity and consistency test and a few relocated stations were de trended the linear trend was removed then we resampled the daily temperature precipitation and evaporation data into the annual timescale 3 3 reanalysis data era interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis data and has been accessible since january 1 1979 up to the present berrisford et al 2011 its gridded data products include various 3 hourly surface parameter describing weather ocean waves and land surface conditions and 6 hourly high altitude parameters which cover the troposphere and stratosphere the vertical integral of the atmospheric flux the monthly average of many parameters and other derived fields are also produced dee et al 2011 era interim is been widely used in the study of hydrological cycle at global and regional scales for instance in studying the changes and possible mechanisms of moisture flux over the qhl basin li et al 2019b the era interim data were used here to describe the water vapor transport in the qhl basin xie et al 2018 the changes in large scale water vapor in 2005 2012 2015 2017 and 2018 are analyzed to understand the mechanism of precipitation changes over the qhl basin during the abnormal hydrological years total column water vapor is used to investigate the changes in atmospheric circulation in addition the atmospheric circulation indexes including the arctic oscillation ao el niño southern oscillation enso southern oscillation index soi north atlantic oscillation nao pacific decadal oscillation pdo and pacific north america pna pattern from the national climatic data center ncdc were employed in this study the monthly data were aggregated into the annual and seasonal average averages 3 4 glacier mass balance estimation we estimated the long term mass balances of glaciers within the qhl basin for the period of february 2000 to may 2014 based on the srtm and tandem x dems jarvis et al 2008 takaku et al 2014 wessel 2018 the glacier mass balances were mainly estimated in a three step process as follows co registration and correction of the potential bias of the multi temporal dem datasets correction of the penetration depth of the c band of srtm dem by modeling the penetration depth as a linear function of elevation by performing a robust linear fitting of the effective glacier elevation difference between the c band and x band of srtm and estimation of the average glacier elevation changes and their conversion to the rate change of glacier mass the details of the methods used to quantify the increased glacial meltwater can be read from the work of ke et al 2020 3 5 lake water budget models for the qhl the lake water budget model used to examine the water budget can be expressed as follows song et al 2015a 1 δ w lake p lake r e lake α 2 r r p r g 3 α g i g o δ o where δ w lake is the net annual lake water budget which can be deduced from the water level changes of the qhl in this study p lake and e lake refer to the precipitation and the evaporation over the lake respectively r is the run off depth that includes two parts surface rainfall and snowfall run off r p meltwater run off from the glacier r g α refers to the groundwater changes and some other factors influencing the lake water budget g i g o refers to the groundwater seepage into from the lake and δ o includes some other factors which cause minor variations of the water level such as permafrost thawing processes for these climate variables used in the lake water balance model r p is mainly influenced by rainfall and snowfall while the meltwater runoff from glacier r g is mainly determined by temperature since the perennial permafrost or the seasonal impermeable layer may cause only minor variations to lake water and limited published results on groundwater behavior and its impact on lake water budget may be weakened by the perennial permafrost or the seasonal impermeable layer the impact of groundwater exchange and the perennial permafrost or the seasonal impermeable layer on the lake s water budget were considered negligible in the early work lei et al 2013 wang and dou 1998 zhang et al 2017b therefore the groundwater seepage and the perennial permafrost are not examined in this study according to the hydrological processes related to lake water balance for closed basins the major factors influencing lake level changes include temperature precipitation evaporation and glacier meltwater inflow therefore in view of investigating the associations between the recent lake level rises and climatic and hydrologic variables the statistical correlations of these four main factors were investigated with the lake level changes at the annual timescale duo et al 2010 guo et al 2019 huang et al 2011 zhu et al 2010 4 results and analysis 4 1 abnormal lake water level changes of the qhl in several key years due to the limitation of the time period of the legos satellite altimetry data we reconstructed a long time series of water levels combined with in situ gauge measured water level from 1970 to 2018 the pearson correlation coefficient r 0 98 p 0 01 in fig 2 a shows a strong correlation between the lake level from the legos satellite altimetry and the in situ measurements during the overlapping period 1995 2014 this finding indicates that the combined water level is highly suitable for monitoring qhl water level changes as shown in fig 2b the water level of qhl exhibits a substantial decline before 2004 which has been offset by an upward trend and then has recently reversed to the stage around 1970 the lake level was measured at 3195 60 m in 1970 and gradually fell to 3192 97 m in 2004 at an average rate of 0 08 m a for the period of 1970 2004 then followed with an obvious increase since 2004 at an average rate of 0 20 m a in this study we defined the abnormal year after 2004 in which the water level change greater than 0 3 m as abnormal years including 2005 2012 2015 and 2017 2018 as shown in fig 2b the water levels of qhl shows relatively substantial increases in 2005 2012 2015 and 2017 2018 which raises abruptly by 0 46 m a on average the lake level increases by 0 43 m 0 5 m 0 43 m 0 32 m 0 64 m in 2005 2012 2015 and 2017 2018 fig 2c respectively the total abnormal increases in these five years mentioned above accounted for 78 10 of the total increase from 2004 to 2018 therefore the abnormal increases of the water level in key wet years have dominantly contributed to the rapid water level recovery in recent years time series of the lake area derived from the jrc monthly water recurrence dataset pekel et al 2016 and the corresponding monthly lake level was selected from the legos altimetry dataset in this study we estimated the lake water storage changes by combining the lake area with the lake level data in the period of water level increase during 2004 2018 fig 3 a shows a good match between the lake water area and the water level with a pearson s correlation coefficient r of 0 97 at the confidence level of 99 subsequently we applied the relationships between the lake area and water level to extrapolate time series of the lake areas from 2004 to 2018 we also estimated the annual water storage changes in the qhl fig 3b illustrates the qhl accumulative water storage variations from 2004 to 2018 the finding indicate that the water storage changes have a general upward trend especially in those abnormal years with substantial lake level rises the net cumulative water storage can reach 12 75 km3 and the increase in these five abnormal years may contribute 78 46 of the net gained water mass 4 2 relationships between the lake level changes and climatic and hydrologic variables fig 4 a show the time series of annual evaporation annual temperature annual precipitation and lake level changes of the qhl from 2004 to 2018 the annual evaporation tends to decrease and the low evaporation peaks generally correspond to rapid rises in water level e g 2005 2012 and 2018 but the change may also be small e g 2008 which suggests evaporation variations contribute to the lake water budgets but their correlation is relatively weak from fig 4b the pearson correlation coefficient between water level changes and temperature is not statistically significant indicating that the contribution of temperature to the lake level changes is small throughout the period of rapid water level recovery the temporal pattern of the annual precipitation variations is similar to that of the water level changes of the qhl from 2004 to 2018 fig 4a the annual precipitation ranges from 433 48 mm to 610 36 mm with an average of 466 80 mm which fluctuates but generally shows an upward trend we conducted the pearson correlations between precipitation and water level changes and the result showed that the correlation coefficient could reach 0 61 at the statistical confidence level of 95 fig 4d overall the annual precipitation is significantly correlated to lake level changes in the above mentioned abnormal years the evident water level increases correspond well with high precipitation especially for 2017 and 2018 the total annual precipitation increased dramatically by 45 72 mm and 143 57 mm relative to the average value from 2004 to 2018 the glaciers in the tp have experienced obvious shrinkage under climate change sun et al 2018 yao et al 2012 and this shrinkage has influenced certain hydrological processes such as river discharge and lake growth even causing glacial lake outburst flood bolch et al 2008 song et al 2014b yao et al 2007 ye et al 2007 to confirm whether the increased glacier meltwater in the qhl basin is closely related to the recent lake level changes we estimated the glacier mass balances over the qhl basin based on the dems differentiation from 2004 to 2014 the result revealed that glaciers with a total area of 10 25 km2 within the basin had experienced significant shrinkage and thinning at the mean rate of 0 49 0 04 m a moreover the net mass loss was estimated at 0 004 0 0006 km3 a which only accounts for approximately 0 44 of the lake water storage changes per year 0 91 km3 a therefore glacier meltwater is not a dominant factor of the recent growth of the lake level the above detailed comparative analyses between lake level changes and climatic and hydrologic variables show that the water level changes of the qhl are closely related to precipitation during the period of rapid water level recovery the results are consistent with the previous qualitative research in which the growth of tibetan lakes reportedly might have been dominated by the wet climate cui and li 2016 lei et al 2019 liu et al 2016 song et al 2014c song et al 2014c reported that the water level changes of most tibetan lakes are closely associated with precipitation change at the plateau scale consequently what affects abnormal precipitation in the abovementioned five years and what physical process is involved to answer these questions we further investigated the water vapor transport of the qhl basin as discussed in the next section 4 3 response of anomalous precipitation to the water vapor transport precipitation is mainly affected by local transpiration and water vapor transport from the surrounding areas however compared with water vapor transport local transpiration has a smaller magnitude li et al 2019b xie et al 2018 zhou and yu 2005 therefore the water vapor transport around the qhl basin was analyzed to explore the abnormal precipitation changes in the qhl basin we investigated the response of abnormal precipitation changes to water vapor over the qhl basin by examining water vapor changes since 2004 fig 5 show the spatial distribution of the climatological vapor flux across different seasons the water vapor transport in the southeast china coastal region significantly differs in summer and winter however the water vapor transport in the qhl basin does not show significant different seasonal characteristics in terms of spatial distribution the precipitation in the qhl basin is mainly influenced by two transport pathways of water vapor the first pathway is carried by the indian summer monsoon a southwesterly current associated with the strong somali jet stream that carries large amounts of water vapor southeast of the qhl basin from the arabian sea and the bay of bengal moreover several radial river basins located in the southeast of the plateau such as the jinsha river nu river and lancang river basin facilitate the transport of water vapor to the qhl basin the second pathway is transported by the mid latitude westerlies when the mid latitude westerlies reach the western boundary of the qhl basin they are divided into north and south branches and the water vapor carried by the westerly wind from the south branch is transported southward until it is turned to the east at 30 n then it is combined with the southwest wind from the indian ocean to transport water vapor to the qhl basin besides the water vapor transport from the south china sea and the western pacific also plays a significant role in the climatic precipitation over the qhl basin and it may become the most important water vapor transport stream for abnormally strong precipitation zhou and yu 2005 for the whole qhl basin the water vapor exhibits strong interannual variations which may be influenced by climate factors such as enso liu et al 2016 zhou and yu 2005 enso plays an important role in influencing water vapor transport from the western pacific to mainland china wang and yan 2011 fig 6 a e show the water vapor anomaly around the qhl basin in these five abnormal precipitation years the red markings represent increased water vapor flux indicating that water vapor has a consistent pattern with precipitation anomalies in 2005 and 2012 the water vapor of the qhl basin is transported by the weak easterly but the total water vapor increases fig 6a and b the differences can be observed relative to the other three years particularly in 2015 2017 and 2018 when water vapor is transported by abnormal northwesterly southeast wind and south wind respectively in comparison the total water vapor increases with the most significant anomaly in 2017 2018 this phenomenon may explain why the most dramatic increase has observed in 2017 2018 for water level changes of the qhl during the study period overall for the abnormal precipitation years the total water vapor over some area of the qhl basin increased significantly and the increased total water vapor induced positive precipitation anomalies over most areas of the qhl basin fig 6f considering that the interaction of atmospheric circulation affects regional precipitation by driving water vapor transport we further analyzed the pearson correlation of regional precipitation of the qhl basin and the different atmospheric circulation indexes ao enso soi nao pdo and pna from 1970 to 2018 as shown in table 1 precipitation is related to most of these selected atmospheric circulation indexes at different scales but it is more closely linked to enso at the annual scale the presence of el niño or its opposite la niña is sufficient to change the overall flow of the atmosphere thereby affecting normal weather conditions in many parts of the world feng et al 2011 as shown in table 1 the niño index is strongly but negatively correlated with winter precipitation whereas monthly and annual precipitation are strongly and positively correlated with the niño index overall the correlation of enso and precipitation is the most significant relation among all atmospheric circulation indexes indicating that enso may primarily contribute to the regional precipitation in the qhl basin especially in the 2010 and 2012 with la niño events the precipitation was anomalously high the result is consistent with the investigation of wang and ma 2018 which revealed that particular enso events could cause particular anomalies and affect subsequently phases of the rainy season precipitation in tibet however high precipitation did not always happen in the la niña ei niña years for example in 2017 and 2018 when la niña ei niña were not well developed precipitation was anomalously high over the qhl basin therefore although enso may have contributed to anomalous precipitation by driving water vapor transport other factors such as ao and nao may have also played influencing roles chen et al 2013 ding et al 2018 5 discussions over the past half century the qhl has experienced a continual decrease before 2004 and a rapid recovery in the recent decades as shown by the results indeed numerous previous studies have conducted in depth quantitative research on the continuous water level decline of the qhl in the first 35 years table 2 for example chang et al 2017 found that the water level of the qhl declined from 3196 55 m 1959 to 3192 86 m 2004 due to the decline in precipitation and runoff and the rise in evaporation in the qhl basin li and cui 2016 measured the water level variations of the qhl and found that the lake shrunk significantly from 1961 to 2004 and precipitation and evaporation contributed 36 3 and 27 1 to the decrease in lake level respectively li et al 2007 reported that the water level of the qhl declined by 3 35 m from 1959 to 2000 and they identified precipitation as the primary key driving factor of the continuous decrease in the water level therefore this study only focuses on the water level recovery stage of the qhl after 2004 fig 7 the abnormal water level increases of the qhl is closely associated with precipitation variation the large amount of water vapor required by the precipitation mainly relies on atmospheric circulation to transport water vapor from areas with high water vapor wang et al 2018b enso affects the ocean water vapor transmission to the tp and the precipitation process by affecting the sea surface temperature sst of the bay of bengal waters and the intensity of the indian monsoon the water vapor increased over the qhl basin fig 6a e as more water vapor is transported over the tp through the bay of bengal then it subsides over the qhl basin moreover in the high precipitation years the water vapor transport mainly increases in both the western and southern boundaries of the tp tang et al 2017 the el niño and la niña phenomena warm and cold phases are defined as a five consecutive three month running mean of sst anomalies in the niño 3 4 region that is above below the 0 5 c 0 5 c threshold the abnormal convergence of water vapor in the central north pacific during la niña is conducive to the increase in local atmospheric water vapor content han et al 2017 clearly the marked increase in precipitation in 2012 led to an increase in lake water level which may relate to the very strong 2011 2012 la niña event see fig 7 moreover the developing 2017 2018 la niña led to persistent above normal precipitation during 2017 2018 which explains the sharp rise of lake levels in 2017 2018 these phenomena indicate that enso events may cause abnormal precipitation by affecting water vapor besides the conditions of land surface changes within the precipitation shed can cause precipitation changes if the evaporation increased within the precipitation shed then moisture would be contributed more to the target region zhang et al 2019 an in depth investigation involving the mechanism of water vapor transport is needed in the future 6 conclusions we reconstructed the lake water level of the qhl from 1970 to 2018 near half century based on the legos altimetry and in situ gauge measured data the reconstruction of water level over a half century can improve our understanding of the lake level changes related to climatic and hydrologic changes with the use of a longer temporal scale this study identified the characteristics of the water level changes of qhl in some abnormal hydrological years and quantified the contributing factors of those years to the overall reversed upward tendency since early 2000s then the associations between the abnormal shifts of the lake level and the key climate variables in these abnormal years were examined finally the possible atmospheric circulations that dominate the local climate variables of the qhl basin and its surroundings were determined overall the lake level changes can be partitioned into two periods the first period of dramatic decline from 1970 to 2004 and the second period of rapid reversed increase from 2004 to 2018 since the early 2000s the water level of the qhl has shown a sharply rising tendency which saw a near 3 m rise in the recent 15 years particularly in 2005 2012 2015 and 2017 2018 the water level showed anomalies with an average increase of 0 46 m the abnormal increases in the five years mentioned above accounted for 78 10 of the total water level rise from 2004 to 2018 the lake level returned to the beginning stage of the water level drop before the half century a phenomenon that was largely caused by the lake level increase in these anomalous years also we confirmed that the precipitation was strongly related to the lake level changes with a high pearson correlation coefficient of 0 61 in comparison the glacier mass balance estimate suggests that the increased glacial meltwater in the qhl basin may only account for approximately 0 44 of the lake water gain the pearson correlation coefficients between water level changes and evaporation and temperature were also not statistically significant thus precipitation could have dominated the recent water level rises of the qhl especially in these anomalous years rather than evaporation temperature and glacial meltwater furthermore the typical anomalous precipitations were related to water vapor transport as more water vapor was transported and subsequently subsided over the qhl basin during these anomalous years the water vapor in the qhl basin is mainly transported through two pathways namely the indian summer monsoon and the mid latitude westerlies atmospheric circulations such as enso and ao may contribute to the anomalous precipitation by driving the water vapor transport of qhl basin but the case varied across the different years although this study could be beneficial for our understanding of the driving mechanism of the rapid water level recovery of qhl and hydrological cycles under future climate change scenarios more comprehensive investigations of the physical processes are further required to clarify the climate driven mechanism lake level changes of tibet in the future work credit authorship contribution statement chenyu fan conceptualization data curation formal analysis

4960,qinghai lake qhl the largest saline lake in china is located in the tibetan plateau the lake plays an important role in regional water and nutrient cycles and the sustenance of semi arid ecosystem functions over the past half century the lake experienced substantial changes in its water level in a seesaw pattern in the first 35 years the lake level presented a dramatic continual decrease of 2 63 m then a reversed upward tendency appears beginning the early 21st century the water level in the recent years has recovered to the stage from 50 years ago around 1970 however the driving factor causing the seesaw pattern changes remains to be unclearly understood the goal of this study is to investigate the abnormal changes in the water level of the qhl from 1970 to 2018 and explore the primary contributor of the reversed shifts by taking the climate driving view then we discuss the possible atmospheric circulations that are tightly associated with the climate variables over the qhl catchment and its surroundings results show that the rapid water level recovery of the qhl in recent years is attributable to the substantial increases in water levels in several key abnormal wet years of 2005 2012 2015 and 2017 2018 the lake level variations coincide with annual precipitation rather than temperature and evaporation besides this study reveals that the atmospheric water vapor flux in the qhl basin is mainly transported from the west and southwest to the east for the anomalous high precipitation wet years the total water vapor of the qhl basin increases significantly the enso and other atmospheric circulation factors may be related to the precipitation variations that drive the water vapor transport of the qhl basin keywords qinghai lake climate

terrestrial surface lehner and döll 2004 messager et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 verpoorter et al 2014 moreover lakes not only are an essential component of the global hydrological biogeochemical and ecological processes pace and prairie 2004 sobek et al 2003 verpoorter et al 2014 but they also support at least 100 000 different species dudgeon 2005 and provides considerable services to human

universal importance of inland lake dynamics our understanding about this topic remains limited climate change and human activities e g water diversion and land cover change have led to significant changes in the inundation area water level and water storage of lakes tao et al 2020 especially during the recent several decades many large lakes or lake clusters have experienced significant dynamic changes for instance many lakes in dry endorheic basins have lost majority of their water due to human activities such as river water diversion and unregulated withdrawal pekel et al 2016 wang and ma 2018 wang et al 2018a including those in the aral sea micklin 1988 the great salt lake wurtsbaugh et al 2017 and the lake chad coe and birkett 2004 gao et al 2011 by contrast most lakes on the tibetan plateau tp hereinafter and some arctic thermokarst ponds have shown significant expansions in the recent two decades due to the changing climate phan et al 2012 roy leveillee and burn 2017 zhang et al

dramatic expansion of lakes undoubtedly is one of the most significant characteristics of environmental changes on the tp lei et al 2014 song et al 2013 2014a zhang et al 2011 many literatures have documented the rapid expansion of inundated area water level increases and substantial volume accumulations of the tibetan lakes crétaux et al 2016 kropáček et al 2012 lei et al 2014 2013 li et al 2011a 2019a phan et al 2012 qiao et al 2017 song et al 2013 treichler et al 2019 yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 2017a zhu et al 2010 qinghai lake qhl hereinafter as the largest lake of china is located in the northeast part of the tp similar to most of the other lakes in the tp the qhl belongs to the closed lake type without any outflow draining to the rivers compared with open lakes regulated by inflows outflows closed lakes in the basin are more sensitive to changes in regional water budget many prior studies have reported that the qhl showed significant shrinkage during the last several decades of the 20th century followed by rapid growths since the early 21st century dong and song 2011 li et al 2007 wan et al 2014 yuan et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 as these tibetan lakes are located in high altitude and remote endorheic drainage system with minimal human interventions their dynamics represent the combined effects of climate changes and cryosphere responses the qhl is located in the intersection of the east asian monsoon the indian monsoon and the westerly jet stream cui and li 2015 zhang et al 2011 suggesting a complex climate driving mechanism of the lake s dynamics most previous studies have consensually agreed that the lasting shrinkage could be attributed to the increased lake evaporation beyond the decreased precipitation recharge rate as well as the rapid rising air temperatures after the mid 20th century however the reversed growth tendency in the recent years could be associated with multiple factors including the increased warming induced meltwater and dry to wet hydrological transitions locally dong and song 2011 jin and feng 2013 shi et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 reported that snow meltwater contributed to basin scale runoff at 13 proportion and suggested its insignificant influence on lake level variations in general the dominant driving factor of the recent remarkable expansion of the qhl still remains largely uncertain a major reason may lie in that most previous reports focus on the attribution of most previous reports to the long term tendency of lake growths rather than the abnormal changes in the water area and level of the qhl in certain key hydrological years consequently the main objectives of this study is to 1 identify the characteristics of lake level variations in certain abnormal hydrological years and subsequently quantify the contributing factors of those years to the lake s reversed growth tendency since the early 2000s based on the combined analysis of in situ gauge measured water level and satellite altimetry data 2 examine the associations of abnormal lake level shifts by using key climate variables in these abnormal years and 3 further determine the possible atmospheric circulations dominating the local climate variables over the qhl basin and its surroundings the results would contribute to advancing our understanding of the driving mechanism of the recent dramatic growths of the qhl and other tp lakes and hydrological cycles under future climate change scenarios moreover the results can broaden our perspective on the linkage of the between atmospheric circulation and precipitation 2 study area the qhl is located in the southeast of the lake s basin 36 32 37 15 n 99 36 100 16 e with the area of approximately 4472 73 km2 and the water level of 3196 18 m as measured in 2018 which is the largest saline lake in china the qhl was formed by the collapse of the datong mountains in the northern the qilian mountains and the riyue mountain in the south and the qinghai nan mountains dong et al 2019 zheng 1997 the main inflow rivers include the buha river the shaliu river the hargai river the uha aran river and the heima river yi et al 2010b the total runoff of these rivers comprises approximately 86 of the surface runoff into the lake among them the buha river and shaliu river account for approximately 64 of the total runoff ding et al 2018 the lake s location in the intersection zone of the eastern asian monsoon region the northwest arid region and the tp alpine region has led to obvious regional climate characteristics such as dry and cold little rain windy strong solar radiation and large diurnal temperature of 10 the semi arid alpine climate is typical in the plateau yi et al 2010b from the middle of the 20th century to the early 21st century the regional temperature has increased by 1 the evaporation on the surface has increased by 200 mm and the lake water level has decreased by 3 m dong et al 2019 li and cui 2016 li et al 2007 3 material and methodology 3 1 legos altimetry and in situ gauged lake level datasets since the late 1980s several satellite altimetry missions have been launched including geosat 1986 1988 ers 1 1991 1996 topex poseidon 1992 2005 ers 2 1995 present gfo 2000 2008 jason 1 2001 present jason2 2008 present and envisat 2002 present crétaux et al 2016 the combined altimetry datasets can provide measurements of more than two decades of history of the earth s surface elevations and are expected to be continuously updated over the next decade the laboratoire d études en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos altimetry data set for the period of 1995 2018 were downloaded from http hydroweb theia land fr the datasets have passed various classical corrections such as orbit ionospheric and tropospheric corrections polar and solid earth tides and sea state bias crétaux et al 2011 the legos altimetry datasets were used to derive the mean value of all the water level measurements during a year the in situ gauged lake level data for the qhl from 1970 to 2014 were obtained from the average of two hydrological stations namely shatuosi and xiashe in this study the overlapping period 1995 2014 of the legos altimetry data and the in situ gauged lake level data was fitted then the annual lake level of qhl from 1970 to 2018 was reconstructed according to the fitting relationship 3 2 meteorological data twenty five meteorological stations with relatively high impact on the qhl basin were selected to examine the associations of the lake water level with the key climate variables and the response of the climate variables to the large scale atmospheric circulation the distribution of the meteorological stations around the qhl basin is shown in fig 1 in this study we obtained daily temperature precipitation and evaporation data for the period of 2004 2018 from the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn the dataset passed strict quality control including the uniformity and consistency test and a few relocated stations were de trended the linear trend was removed then we resampled the daily temperature precipitation and evaporation data into the annual timescale 3 3 reanalysis data era interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis data and has been accessible since january 1 1979 up to the present berrisford et al 2011 its gridded data products include various 3 hourly surface parameter describing weather ocean waves and land surface conditions and 6 hourly high altitude parameters which cover the troposphere and stratosphere the vertical integral of the atmospheric flux the monthly average of many parameters and other derived fields are also produced dee et al 2011 era interim is been widely used in the study of hydrological cycle at global and regional scales for instance in studying the changes and possible mechanisms of moisture flux over the qhl basin li et al 2019b the era interim data were used here to describe the water vapor transport in the qhl basin xie et al 2018 the changes in large scale water vapor in 2005 2012 2015 2017 and 2018 are analyzed to understand the mechanism of precipitation changes over the qhl basin during the abnormal hydrological years total column water vapor is used to investigate the changes in atmospheric circulation in addition the atmospheric circulation indexes including the arctic oscillation ao el niño southern oscillation enso southern oscillation index soi north atlantic oscillation nao pacific decadal oscillation pdo and pacific north america pna pattern from the national climatic data center ncdc were employed in this study the monthly data were aggregated into the annual and seasonal average averages 3 4 glacier mass balance estimation we estimated the long term mass balances of glaciers within the qhl basin for the period of february 2000 to may 2014 based on the srtm and tandem x dems jarvis et al 2008 takaku et al 2014 wessel 2018 the glacier mass balances were mainly estimated in a three step process as follows co registration and correction of the potential bias of the multi temporal dem datasets correction of the penetration depth of the c band of srtm dem by modeling the penetration depth as a linear function of elevation by performing a robust linear fitting of the effective glacier elevation difference between the c band and x band of srtm and estimation of the average glacier elevation changes and their conversion to the rate change of glacier mass the details of the methods used to quantify the increased glacial meltwater can be read from the work of ke et al 2020 3 5 lake water budget models for the qhl the lake water budget model used to examine the water budget can be expressed as follows song et al 2015a 1 δ w lake p lake r e lake α 2 r r p r g 3 α g i g o δ o where δ w lake is the net annual lake water budget which can be deduced from the water level changes of the qhl in this study p lake and e lake refer to the precipitation and the evaporation over the lake respectively r is the run off depth that includes two parts surface rainfall and snowfall run off r p meltwater run off from the glacier r g α refers to the groundwater changes and some other factors influencing the lake water budget g i g o refers to the groundwater seepage into from the lake and δ o includes some other factors which cause minor variations of the water level such as permafrost thawing processes for these climate variables used in the lake water balance model r p is mainly influenced by rainfall and snowfall while the meltwater runoff from glacier r g is mainly determined by temperature since the perennial permafrost or the seasonal impermeable layer may cause only minor variations to lake water and limited published results on groundwater behavior and its impact on lake water budget may be weakened by the perennial permafrost or the seasonal impermeable layer the impact of groundwater exchange and the perennial permafrost or the seasonal impermeable layer on the lake s water budget were considered negligible in the early work lei et al 2013 wang and dou 1998 zhang et al 2017b therefore the groundwater seepage and the perennial permafrost are not examined in this study according to the hydrological processes related to lake water balance for closed basins the major factors influencing lake level changes include temperature precipitation evaporation and glacier meltwater inflow therefore in view of investigating the associations between the recent lake level rises and climatic and hydrologic variables the statistical correlations of these four main factors were investigated with the lake level changes at the annual timescale duo et al 2010 guo et al 2019 huang et al 2011 zhu et al 2010 4 results and analysis 4 1 abnormal lake water level changes of the qhl in several key years due to the limitation of the time period of the legos satellite altimetry data we reconstructed a long time series of water levels combined with in situ gauge measured water level from 1970 to 2018 the pearson correlation coefficient r 0 98 p 0 01 in fig 2 a shows a strong correlation between the lake level from the legos satellite altimetry and the in situ measurements during the overlapping period 1995 2014 this finding indicates that the combined water level is highly suitable for monitoring qhl water level changes as shown in fig 2b the water level of qhl exhibits a substantial decline before 2004 which has been offset by an upward trend and then has recently reversed to the stage around 1970 the lake level was measured at 3195 60 m in 1970 and gradually fell to 3192 97 m in 2004 at an average rate of 0 08 m a for the period of 1970 2004 then followed with an obvious increase since 2004 at an average rate of 0 20 m a in this study we defined the abnormal year after 2004 in which the water level change greater than 0 3 m as abnormal years including 2005 2012 2015 and 2017 2018 as shown in fig 2b the water levels of qhl shows relatively substantial increases in 2005 2012 2015 and 2017 2018 which raises abruptly by 0 46 m a on average the lake level increases by 0 43 m 0 5 m 0 43 m 0 32 m 0 64 m in 2005 2012 2015 and 2017 2018 fig 2c respectively the total abnormal increases in these five years mentioned above accounted for 78 10 of the total increase from 2004 to 2018 therefore the abnormal increases of the water level in key wet years have dominantly contributed to the rapid water level recovery in recent years time series of the lake area derived from the jrc monthly water recurrence dataset pekel et al 2016 and the corresponding monthly lake level was selected from the legos altimetry dataset in this study we estimated the lake water storage changes by combining the lake area with the lake level data in the period of water level increase during 2004 2018 fig 3 a shows a good match between the lake water area and the water level with a pearson s correlation coefficient r of 0 97 at the confidence level of 99 subsequently we applied the relationships between the lake area and water level to extrapolate time series of the lake areas from 2004 to 2018 we also estimated the annual water storage changes in the qhl fig 3b illustrates the qhl accumulative water storage variations from 2004 to 2018 the finding indicate that the water storage changes have a general upward trend especially in those abnormal years with substantial lake level rises the net cumulative water storage can reach 12 75 km3 and the increase in these five abnormal years may contribute 78 46 of the net gained water mass 4 2 relationships between the lake level changes and climatic and hydrologic variables fig 4 a show the time series of annual evaporation annual temperature annual precipitation and lake level changes of the qhl from 2004 to 2018 the annual evaporation tends to decrease and the low evaporation peaks generally correspond to rapid rises in water level e g 2005 2012 and 2018 but the change may also be small e g 2008 which suggests evaporation variations contribute to the lake water budgets but their correlation is relatively weak from fig 4b the pearson correlation coefficient between water level changes and temperature is not statistically significant indicating that the contribution of temperature to the lake level changes is small throughout the period of rapid water level recovery the temporal pattern of the annual precipitation variations is similar to that of the water level changes of the qhl from 2004 to 2018 fig 4a the annual precipitation ranges from 433 48 mm to 610 36 mm with an average of 466 80 mm which fluctuates but generally shows an upward trend we conducted the pearson correlations between precipitation and water level changes and the result showed that the correlation coefficient could reach 0 61 at the statistical confidence level of 95 fig 4d overall the annual precipitation is significantly correlated to lake level changes in the above mentioned abnormal years the evident water level increases correspond well with high precipitation especially for 2017 and 2018 the total annual precipitation increased dramatically by 45 72 mm and 143 57 mm relative to the average value from 2004 to 2018 the glaciers in the tp have experienced obvious shrinkage under climate change sun et al 2018 yao et al 2012 and this shrinkage has influenced certain hydrological processes such as river discharge and lake growth even causing glacial lake outburst flood bolch et al 2008 song et al 2014b yao et al 2007 ye et al 2007 to confirm whether the increased glacier meltwater in the qhl basin is closely related to the recent lake level changes we estimated the glacier mass balances over the qhl basin based on the dems differentiation from 2004 to 2014 the result revealed that glaciers with a total area of 10 25 km2 within the basin had experienced significant shrinkage and thinning at the mean rate of 0 49 0 04 m a moreover the net mass loss was estimated at 0 004 0 0006 km3 a which only accounts for approximately 0 44 of the lake water storage changes per year 0 91 km3 a therefore glacier meltwater is not a dominant factor of the recent growth of the lake level the above detailed comparative analyses between lake level changes and climatic and hydrologic variables show that the water level changes of the qhl are closely related to precipitation during the period of rapid water level recovery the results are consistent with the previous qualitative research in which the growth of tibetan lakes reportedly might have been dominated by the wet climate cui and li 2016 lei et al 2019 liu et al 2016 song et al 2014c song et al 2014c reported that the water level changes of most tibetan lakes are closely associated with precipitation change at the plateau scale consequently what affects abnormal precipitation in the abovementioned five years and what physical process is involved to answer these questions we further investigated the water vapor transport of the qhl basin as discussed in the next section 4 3 response of anomalous precipitation to the water vapor transport precipitation is mainly affected by local transpiration and water vapor transport from the surrounding areas however compared with water vapor transport local transpiration has a smaller magnitude li et al 2019b xie et al 2018 zhou and yu 2005 therefore the water vapor transport around the qhl basin was analyzed to explore the abnormal precipitation changes in the qhl basin we investigated the response of abnormal precipitation changes to water vapor over the qhl basin by examining water vapor changes since 2004 fig 5 show the spatial distribution of the climatological vapor flux across different seasons the water vapor transport in the southeast china coastal region significantly differs in summer and winter however the water vapor transport in the qhl basin does not show significant different seasonal characteristics in terms of spatial distribution the precipitation in the qhl basin is mainly influenced by two transport pathways of water vapor the first pathway is carried by the indian summer monsoon a southwesterly current associated with the strong somali jet stream that carries large amounts of water vapor southeast of the qhl basin from the arabian sea and the bay of bengal moreover several radial river basins located in the southeast of the plateau such as the jinsha river nu river and lancang river basin facilitate the transport of water vapor to the qhl basin the second pathway is transported by the mid latitude westerlies when the mid latitude westerlies reach the western boundary of the qhl basin they are divided into north and south branches and the water vapor carried by the westerly wind from the south branch is transported southward until it is turned to the east at 30 n then it is combined with the southwest wind from the indian ocean to transport water vapor to the qhl basin besides the water vapor transport from the south china sea and the western pacific also plays a significant role in the climatic precipitation over the qhl basin and it may become the most important water vapor transport stream for abnormally strong precipitation zhou and yu 2005 for the whole qhl basin the water vapor exhibits strong interannual variations which may be influenced by climate factors such as enso liu et al 2016 zhou and yu 2005 enso plays an important role in influencing water vapor transport from the western pacific to mainland china wang and yan 2011 fig 6 a e show the water vapor anomaly around the qhl basin in these five abnormal precipitation years the red markings represent increased water vapor flux indicating that water vapor has a consistent pattern with precipitation anomalies in 2005 and 2012 the water vapor of the qhl basin is transported by the weak easterly but the total water vapor increases fig 6a and b the differences can be observed relative to the other three years particularly in 2015 2017 and 2018 when water vapor is transported by abnormal northwesterly southeast wind and south wind respectively in comparison the total water vapor increases with the most significant anomaly in 2017 2018 this phenomenon may explain why the most dramatic increase has observed in 2017 2018 for water level changes of the qhl during the study period overall for the abnormal precipitation years the total water vapor over some area of the qhl basin increased significantly and the increased total water vapor induced positive precipitation anomalies over most areas of the qhl basin fig 6f considering that the interaction of atmospheric circulation affects regional precipitation by driving water vapor transport we further analyzed the pearson correlation of regional precipitation of the qhl basin and the different atmospheric circulation indexes ao enso soi nao pdo and pna from 1970 to 2018 as shown in table 1 precipitation is related to most of these selected atmospheric circulation indexes at different scales but it is more closely linked to enso at the annual scale the presence of el niño or its opposite la niña is sufficient to change the overall flow of the atmosphere thereby affecting normal weather conditions in many parts of the world feng et al 2011 as shown in table 1 the niño index is strongly but negatively correlated with winter precipitation whereas monthly and annual precipitation are strongly and positively correlated with the niño index overall the correlation of enso and precipitation is the most significant relation among all atmospheric circulation indexes indicating that enso may primarily contribute to the regional precipitation in the qhl basin especially in the 2010 and 2012 with la niño events the precipitation was anomalously high the result is consistent with the investigation of wang and ma 2018 which revealed that particular enso events could cause particular anomalies and affect subsequently phases of the rainy season precipitation in tibet however high precipitation did not always happen in the la niña ei niña years for example in 2017 and 2018 when la niña ei niña were not well developed precipitation was anomalously high over the qhl basin therefore although enso may have contributed to anomalous precipitation by driving water vapor transport other factors such as ao and nao may have also played influencing roles chen et al 2013 ding et al 2018 5 discussions over the past half century the qhl has experienced a continual decrease before 2004 and a rapid recovery in the recent decades as shown by the results indeed numerous previous studies have conducted in depth quantitative research on the continuous water level decline of the qhl in the first 35 years table 2 for example chang et al 2017 found that the water level of the qhl declined from 3196 55 m 1959 to 3192 86 m 2004 due to the decline in precipitation and runoff and the rise in evaporation in the qhl basin li and cui 2016 measured the water level variations of the qhl and found that the lake shrunk significantly from 1961 to 2004 and precipitation and evaporation contributed 36 3 and 27 1 to the decrease in lake level respectively li et al 2007 reported that the water level of the qhl declined by 3 35 m from 1959 to 2000 and they identified precipitation as the primary key driving factor of the continuous decrease in the water level therefore this study only focuses on the water level recovery stage of the qhl after 2004 fig 7 the abnormal water level increases of the qhl is closely associated with precipitation variation the large amount of water vapor required by the precipitation mainly relies on atmospheric circulation to transport water vapor from areas with high water vapor wang et al 2018b enso affects the ocean water vapor transmission to the tp and the precipitation process by affecting the sea surface temperature sst of the bay of bengal waters and the intensity of the indian monsoon the water vapor increased over the qhl basin fig 6a e as more water vapor is transported over the tp through the bay of bengal then it subsides over the qhl basin moreover in the high precipitation years the water vapor transport mainly increases in both the western and southern boundaries of the tp tang et al 2017 the el niño and la niña phenomena warm and cold phases are defined as a five consecutive three month running mean of sst anomalies in the niño 3 4 region that is above below the 0 5 c 0 5 c threshold the abnormal convergence of water vapor in the central north pacific during la niña is conducive to the increase in local atmospheric water vapor content han et al 2017 clearly the marked increase in precipitation in 2012 led to an increase in lake water level which may relate to the very strong 2011 2012 la niña event see fig 7 moreover the developing 2017 2018 la niña led to persistent above normal precipitation during 2017 2018 which explains the sharp rise of lake levels in 2017 2018 these phenomena indicate that enso events may cause abnormal precipitation by affecting water vapor besides the conditions of land surface changes within the precipitation shed can cause precipitation changes if the evaporation increased within the precipitation shed then moisture would be contributed more to the target region zhang et al 2019 an in depth investigation involving the mechanism of water vapor transport is needed in the future 6 conclusions we reconstructed the lake water level of the qhl from 1970 to 2018 near half century based on the legos altimetry and in situ gauge measured data the reconstruction of water level over a half century can improve our understanding of the lake level changes related to climatic and hydrologic changes with the use of a longer temporal scale this study identified the characteristics of the water level changes of qhl in some abnormal hydrological years and quantified the contributing factors of those years to the overall reversed upward tendency since early 2000s then the associations between the abnormal shifts of the lake level and the key climate variables in these abnormal years were examined finally the possible atmospheric circulations that dominate the local climate variables of the qhl basin and its surroundings were determined overall the lake level changes can be partitioned into two periods the first period of dramatic decline from 1970 to 2004 and the second period of rapid reversed increase from 2004 to 2018 since the early 2000s the water level of the qhl has shown a sharply rising tendency which saw a near 3 m rise in the recent 15 years particularly in 2005 2012 2015 and 2017 2018 the water level showed anomalies with an average increase of 0 46 m the abnormal increases in the five years mentioned above accounted for 78 10 of the total water level rise from 2004 to 2018 the lake level returned to the beginning stage of the water level drop before the half century a phenomenon that was largely caused by the lake level increase in these anomalous years also we confirmed that the precipitation was strongly related to the lake level changes with a high pearson correlation coefficient of 0 61 in comparison the glacier mass balance estimate suggests that the increased glacial meltwater in the qhl basin may only account for approximately 0 44 of the lake water gain the pearson correlation coefficients between water level changes and evaporation and temperature were also not statistically significant thus precipitation could have dominated the recent water level rises of the qhl especially in these anomalous years rather than evaporation temperature and glacial meltwater furthermore the typical anomalous precipitations were related to water vapor transport as more water vapor was transported and subsequently subsided over the qhl basin during these anomalous years the water vapor in the qhl basin is mainly transported through two pathways namely the indian summer monsoon and the mid latitude westerlies atmospheric circulations such as enso and ao may contribute to the anomalous precipitation by driving the water vapor transport of qhl basin but the case varied across the different years although this study could be beneficial for our understanding of the driving mechanism of the rapid water level recovery of qhl and hydrological cycles under future climate change scenarios more comprehensive investigations of the physical processes are further required to clarify the climate driven mechanism lake level changes of tibet in the future work credit authorship contribution statement chenyu fan conceptualization data curation formal analysis

4961,extensive agricultural use of land coupled with intensive water erosion at geomorphologically diverse areas with uniform soil substrate and originally similar soils can lead to high diversity in

haplic cambisols areas leptosol area and luvisol area in general matching of the scaled curves increased with a decreasing variability of n values i e increasing similarity of a soil pore space geometry and increasing average n values e g for pronounced s shape soil water retention curves the sampling day significantly affected αh αk and αθ in the chernozem area αh and αk in the cambisol developed on shale area and αh and αθ in the leptosol area while values for the chernozem area indicated an improvement in soil hydrological conditions during the vegetation period the values for the luvisol leptosol and cambisol developed on shale areas indicated aggravation no considerable changes were observed for the cambisol developed on granodiorite and shale areas the sampling position significantly affected αθ in both the cambisol areas at some locations e g chernozem area the spatial variability reflected different erosion accumulation processes within the transect to illustrate a practical application of the scaling factors at such locations the scaling factors obtained for the chernozem area were linearly interpolated within the surface layer of the theoretical vertical two layer soil transect and hydrus 2d program was used to simulate water flow in the surface 50 cm layer the results showed a more gradual wetting front after sowing than after harvesting keywords soil diversification soil water retention curve soil hydraulic conductivity curve hydrus program mathematical modeling 1 introduction knowledge of soil hydraulic properties that is soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves is essential when assessing soil water regimes which affect plant growth yield agrochemicals and contaminant transport in soils and their potential leakage toward groundwater the soil structure and consequently soil hydraulic properties of tilled soil vary in space and time strudley et al 2008 chandrasekhar et al 2018 the spatial variability of soil properties within the sloping area may be enhanced by water erosion processes i e soil material loss at steep parts and its accumulation at concave and bottom parts which may even lead to soil type diversification there are several studies which showed the dependence of selected soil properties on some terrain characteristics e g depth of topsoil horizon lark and beckett 1998 mayer et al 2019

or near saturated hydraulic conductivity alletto and coquet 2009 alletto et al 2015 bamberg et al 2011 bodner et al 2008 bormann and klaasen 2008 sacco et al 2012 as well as both soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity mubarak et al 2009a 2009b šípek et al 2019 the long term variability of both hydraulic properties was documented within three and four years period by schwen et al 2011a schwen et al 2011b and jirků et al 2013 respectively the variability of soil hydraulic properties may be assessed using scaling factors the original scaling theory assumed the geometric similarity of the studied soils miller and miller 1956 among others sadeghi et al 2016 documented that the validity of the pore space similarity assumption for a set of soils can be evaluated based on the equality of the shape parameters of their hydraulic functions they also showed that similarity of pore space geometry is not the sole required condition for validity of the miller miller theory because the interrelation is also dependent on solid liquid interactions there have been several approaches for the further extension of this method for dissimilar soils and improvement of this technique assuming different sets of scaling factors various equations for hydraulic function fitting assuming additional information about soil geometry such as fractal dimension and soil texture clausnitzer et al 1992 fallico et al 2010 hopmans 1987 kosugi and hopmans 1998 nasta et al 2013a simmons et al 1979 tuli et al 2001 veltri et al 2013 vereecken et al 2007 vogel et al 1991 warrick et al 1977 scaling factors have been used not only to describe areal variability but also to interpret variability within the soil profile schwen et al 2014 there have been few attempts to use scaling techniques to characterize the variability of soil hydraulic properties within a larger area of diverse soil types nasta et al 2009 successfully applied the scaling approach combined with information about the particle size distribution used for separation of soils with different textures to determine variability in water retention in diverse soils within a catchment area of about 32 km2 nasta et al 2013b used the same approach to interpret the areal variability of a scale factor at the hillslope scale montzka et al 2017 used a scaling approach to interpret a sub grid variance in a global data set of soil hydraulic properties variable soil hydraulic properties strongly affect water flow in soils although scaling factors seem to be more suitable for interpreting variable water regimes than the original soil hydraulic characteristics montzka et al 2017 their utilization is not frequent the impact of spatial variability on water flow nasta et al 2013b has been demonstrated using results from a set of 1d simulation scenarios characterized by various scaling factors proposed by warrick et al 1977 a further set of scenarios defined by various sets of soil hydraulic parameters but not scaling factors were presented by šípek et al 2019 temporal variability has been included in 1d simulation scenarios assuming variable sets of soil hydraulic parameters in predefined periods alletto et al 2015 schwen et al 2011a šípek and tesař 2017 šípek et al 2019 the impact of spatially correlated ks values within the vertical 2d flow domain on hillslope hydrology was documented by cai et al 2017 to our knowledge no study has evaluated the spatial and temporal variability of soil hydraulic properties within an area heavily affected by soil erosion where the original soil type was dependent on terrain position transformed into several different soil types and studies using a scaling technique to interpret the variability of soil hydraulic properties at such locations therefore the goals of this study were to determine 1 whether at such locations general trends in the development of soil hydraulic properties along the slope and in time can be identified or whether these trends are soil type specific and 2 whether the scaling technique is a suitable approach to describe the variability of soil hydraulic properties and water regime in soils at different localities to this end the study set out to 1 select 5 locations with different original soil types or substrates which were strongly modified because of erosion 2 delineate elevation transects which cover the possibly largest differences in soil properties within the area 3 evaluate soil hydraulic properties within selected elevation transects after sowing and after harvesting 4 use scaling factors to characterize the variability of soil hydraulic properties within the transect separately for each sampling date and together for both sampling dates and 5 illustrate the impact of the spatial and temporal variability of the resulting scaling factors on a water flow within the theoretical 2d soil transect simulated with the hydrus 2d program 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas soil sampling and basic soil properties the study was performed on five morphologically diverse study sites table 1 conventional tillage has long been applied at all locations the original soil units haplic chernozem haplic luvisol two haplic cambisols and rendzic leptosol because of soil erosion changed to regosols ranker or sceletic leptosol steep parts and accumulated chernozem accumulated luvisol colluvial soils or haplic phaeozem colluvic base slope and the tributary valley respectively iuss working group wrb 2015 diverse soil conditions at the brumovice locality were described by jakšík et al 2015 2016 sagova mareckova et al 2016 vašát et al 2014 vašát et al 2015a 2015b 2017a 2017b 2017c and zádorová et al 2011a 2011b 2013 2015 at the vidim locality by penížek et al 2016 zádorová et al 2014 2015 vašát et al 2017a vašát et al 2017c at the sedlčany locality adjacent field by zádorová et al 2015 and at localities železná and hostouň by vašát et al 2017a vašát et al 2017c one representative transect with the most diverse terrain attributes elevation slope curvature exposition etc which caused the most variable soil properties was delineated at each location for this purpose digital elevation models were used first the summit of the transect was delineated at the area least impacted by erosion processes next the function create steepest path in arcgis 10 esri 2011 was used to delineate the transect topographic derivatives were calculated using integrated algorithms implemented in arcgis 10 based on this information five sampling points fig s1 were selected at each transect assuming that the soil at different points would be modified by the different stages of the erosion accumulation processes grundwald 2005 miller and schaetzl 2015 1 summit 2 shoulder 3 backslope 4 footslope and 5 toeslope it should be noted that it was not always possible to delineate an ideal hillslope transect in which the characteristics of the terrain would exactly correspond to the definition of individual sections on the slope for instance the toeslope part where the gradient should be only slightly inclined or nearly leveled was not always clearly developed nevertheless the fifth point was defined at the lowest point of the valley or the edge of the plot similarly other points were defined to consider as far as possible the different characteristics of the hillslope the pilot experiment was carried out at the brumovice locality which is the most explored locality out of all 5 localities it has been showed e g jirků et al 2013 that soil properties of topsoil of periodically tiled soils vary greatly throughout the year and that trends in changes in soil properties may vary from year to year therefore we selected two sampling dates to study the most diverse limit conditions during the plant growth periods i e the most destructed soil after soil processing and the most consolidated soil at the end of the vegetation season soil samples were taken from the surface layer 0 25 cm after sowing winter wheat autumn 2010 and after harvest summer 2011 at the other 4 localities samples were taken after crop sowing and harvest during the following 2 years table 1 grab soil samples and 3 undisturbed 100 cm3 soil samples soil core height of 5 1 cm and cross sectional area of 19 60 cm2 per spot and sampling day were taken in the surface horizons grab soils were air dried ground and sifted through a 2 mm sieve the oxidable organic carbon content cox was determined oxidimetrically skjemstad and baldock 2008 fig s2 the particle size distribution fractions of clay silt and sand was determined only on the summer samples no temporal changes were expected using a sedimentation method gee and or 2002 fig s2 the undisturbed soil samples were used to measure bulk density ρd fig s2 using standard methods dane and topp 2002 and soil hydraulic properties 2 2 soil hydraulic properties soil hydraulic properties were studied in the laboratory with undisturbed 100 cm3 soil samples placed in tempe cells using the multi step outflow test van dam et al 1994 initially fully saturated soil samples placed in the tempe cells were slowly drained using 9 pressure head steps a minimum pressure head h of 1000 cm during a 3 week period cumulative outflow in time was measured the soil water content corresponding to the applied pressure heads at the steady state i e when no outflow was observed at the end of each pressure head step was evaluated using the final soil water content and water balance within the soil sample next the single porosity model in hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2018a was applied to simulate the observed multi step outflow and water contents and to obtain the parameters of both soil hydraulic properties soil water retention curve θ h and the hydraulic conductivity function k θ described by the analytical expressions proposed by van genuchten 1980 1 θ e θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m h 0 θ e θ s h 0 2 k θ k s θ e l 1 1 θ e 1 m m 2 h 0 k θ k s h 0 where θe is the effective soil water content dimensionless ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 θr and θs are the residual and saturated soil water contents l3l 3 respectively l is the pore connectivity parameter dimensionless α is the reciprocal of the air entry pressure l 1 n dimensionless is related to the slope of the retention curve at the inflection point and m 1 1 n dimensionless the θs values were set at the measured values the l values were set to 0 5 mualem 1976 the values of θr α n and ks were optimized using the numerical inversion in hydrus 1d fig 1 table s1 and s2 2 3 scaling factors the scaling approach proposed by vogel et al 1991 was used to characterize the variability of soil hydraulic properties within each transect 3 α h h h α k k k α θ θ θ r θ θ r where αh αk and αθ are the scaling factors and represents values of the reference soil hydraulic properties θ h and k h respectively there are different approaches to obtaining these values and characteristics both the scaling factors and reference characteristics may be derived from m soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves consisting of n data points using the least squares minimization as follows i 1 m j 1 n log h j θ j α hi log h ij θ ij 2 m i n θ j θ r θ ij θ ri α θ i where α θ i θ si θ ri θ s θ r θ s 1 m i θ si θ r 1 m i θ ri 4 i 1 m j 1 n k j h j α ki k ij h ij 2 m i n in our case reference characteristics were alternatively computed by fitting the data points of all soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves using the retc program van genuchten et al 1991 table 2 next the scaling factors were calculated for each experimental curve θ h and k h using the least squares minimization equations 4 table s3 equations 4a and 4b both hydraulic properties were obtained via the optimization of the van genuchten parameters equations 1 and 2 i e characteristics were not described by measured data points given by θ h and k values therefore data points corresponding to the applied pressure heads were first calculated using equations 1 and 2 see figs 2 3 s3 and s4 and then analyzed using the scaling technique for the brumovice locality the shapes of the soil hydraulic properties figs 2 and s3 obtained from the different sampling events differed the shape parameters n describing curvatures of the soil hydraulic properties were 1 74 0 23 and 1 93 0 28 table s2 for sampling after sowing and after harvest respectively therefore scaling factors were calculated separately for each sampling day fig 4 and table s3 which agreed with a procedure applied for instance by sadeghi et al 2016 who divided soil hydraulic curves according their shape parameters σ of the kosugi 1994 function and next applied miller and miller 1956 approach for their scaling however the evaluated scaling factors fig 4 and table s3 elucidated only the spatial variability of the soil hydraulic properties for each sampling since one of the goals was to find out if the scaling technique can be applied to characterize the general variability i e the coupled spatial and temporal variabilities of the soil properties in a particular area and to illustrate possible inaccuracies resulted from the application of the linear variability concept for the curves of a greater variability of the n values the scaling factors were also calculated for both sampling days together fig 4 and table s3 due to same reason the scaling factors for other localities were calculated only using data from both sampling events fig 4 table s3 2 4 statistical analyses the average values and standard deviations were calculated at each sampling point and sampling day for all evaluated soil properties van genuchten hydraulic parameters and scaling factors the normality of the data sets was tested by calculating the standardized skewness and standardized kurtosis the main effect analysis of variance anova was then used to assess differences between the soil properties evaluated along the delineated transects i e the impact of sampling position and for different sampling days i e after sowing and after harvest homogeneous data groups were discriminated using duncan s multiple comparison procedure analyses were performed using the statistical software statistica statsoft inc 2013 2 5 using scaling factors for mathematical modeling with hydrus it is assumed that under certain initial and boundary conditions the water flow within the soil profile can be simulated using the richards equation based model e g hydrus 1d and the reference soil hydraulic properties vogel et al 1991 next if similarity conditions are met the dynamic variables for other profiles i e of other soil hydraulic properties can be calculated from the reference dynamic variables and scaling factors for time and space derived from the scaling factors equations 3 however scaling factors can also be used to describe the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties within the flow domain which is even a better practical application of the scaling technique to present a possible implementation of the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties i e scaling factors obtained for the brumovice locality into mathematical model and to illustrate impact of this variability on the water regime in soils the hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2018b model was applied to simulate water flow within the theoretical 2d vertical soil transect this theoretical transect differed from the original sampling transect fig s1 to better show the diverse water distribution in the surface horizon the thickness of the surface horizon of the original transect varied between 40 cm summit 25 cm eroded parts and more than 80 cm bottom of the transect which is considerably less than the transect length of 9000 cm and elevation of 1300 cm and therefore the resulting graphs characterizing water flow in such two dimensional transect would not be illustrative the surface of the theoretical transect was horizontal the length and depth of the transect were 1050 cm and 200 cm respectively the finite element mesh was rectangular 105 horizontal and 50 vertical elements the relative sizes of the elements were 0 1 and 1 at the surface and bottom respectively two layers of different soil properties were delineated 1 surface layer a horizon thickness of 50 cm θr 0 194 cm3cm 3 θs 0 401 cm3cm 3 α 0 019 cm 1 n 1 699 and ks 0 405 cm h 1 i e reference values resulting from both sampling events in table 2 and 2 subsurface loess layer c horizon thickness of 150 cm θr 0 030 cm3cm 3 θs 0 445 cm3cm 3 α 0 038 cm 1 n 1 38 and ks 0 350 cm h 1 i e representative values obtained for loess substrate using the multi step outflow method to introduce the horizontal spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties after sowing or after the harvest the surface layer was divided into 21 vertical segments width of 50 cm the scaling factors αh αk and αθ fig 4 and table s3 obtained for sampling point 1 were set in the 1st segment from the left for point 2 in the 6th segment for point 3 in the 11th segment for point 4 in 16th segment and for point 5 in the 21st segment the values for the other segments i e the constant values of the 3 scaling factors for each segment linearly increased or decreased between set values for the sampling points the initial conditions were set as pressure heads of 1000 cm the atmospheric boundary was set at the top constant precipitation of 1 cm per day and no evaporation the free drainage was set at the bottom the simulation lasted 4 days no transpiration that is no root uptake after sowing or harvest was assumed 3 results and discussion 3 1 the brumovice locality the chernozem region the soil texture fig s2 did not considerably differ along the transect a larger fraction of silt was observed at the greater slope in the middle of the transect likely because of the loess substrate which was plowing mixed into the surface horizon the largest cox content fig s2 was measured at the summit decreased with decreasing elevation because of erosion and increased at the bottom because of the accumulation of soil material eroded from the upper part of the transect which was in this area documented before by jakšík et al 2015 2016 vašát et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2017a b c and zádorová et al 2011a b 2013 2015 the cox content measured after sowing and harvest did not differ considerably the trend in the bulk densities fig s2 increased with the decreasing elevation which can indicate aggravation in soil structure due to erosion accumulation processes jakšík et al 2015 zádorová et al 2011b the ρd values measured after harvest were significantly table s4 lower than those measured after sowing which can be explained by the development of the soil structure during the vegetation period that is by the increased fraction of large capillary pores and thus the entire soil porosity fér et al 2016 2020 jakšík et al 2015 jirků et al 2013 kodešová et al 2011 pavlů et al 2021 this effect was confirmed by the resulting soil hydraulic parameters fig 1 table s1 that is by the significantly table s4 larger values of θs α and ks and not significantly larger values of n obtained after harvest than those after sowing according to the increasing trend in the bulk densities with the decreasing elevation fig s2 the trends in θ s α and ks and n fig 1 table s1 decreased and increased respectively however the sampling position did not have a statistically significant effect on these values except θ s at a 95 confidence level table s4 fig 2 shows that the soil water retention curves h θ which were scaled using the scaling factors fig 4 table s3 for samples after sowing matched better than the curves after harvest despite the scaling factors from the sowing event being more variable than those from the harvest event the high variability of the scaling factors was caused by soil disturbance due to soil processing the lower variability but slightly higher differences in scaled curves can be explained by soil consolidation and slightly different soil pore structure features developed at different positions of the transect resulted from diverse processes in different soil units table 1 in contrast the scaled hydraulic conductivity curves k θ and k h figs 2 and s3 for samples from the harvest event matched better than those from the sowing event the soil water retention and the hydraulic conductivity curves figs 2 and s3 which were scaled using the scaling factors obtained from both sets of the soil hydraulic properties were more spread than when analyzed separately for each sampling due to the differences in the n values from both sets and thus the larger variability of the n values tables s1 and s2 however the differences between the scaled curves are not large if the variability of the n values for each sampling point and time i e the natural variability of specific soil materials table s1 and the fact that the differences in the n values were not statistically significant table s4 is considered the error due to the variability of the n values in transect and time is small thus the scaling method and resulting scaling factors fig 4 seem to be acceptable for describing the spatial and temporal variability of the soil hydraulic properties within this region the values of αθ and αk after harvest were significantly higher than after sowing tables s3 and s5 the values of αh after harvest were significantly lower than after the sowing tables s3 and s5 this is consistent with the observed trends in the bulk densities and soil hydraulic properties figs s1 1 table s1 that is soils after harvest showed a higher retention capacity better aeration and larger infiltration ability than soils after sowing the sampling position did not have a statistically significant effect on all 3 scaling factors at a 95 confidence level table s5 3 2 the vidim locality the luvisol region the soil texture was more diverse than that at the chermozem location samples from sampling points 1 2 and 3 contained larger fractions of clay in comparison to the clay content from the sampling points 4 and 5 likely because of mixing material from the a and bt i e an illuvial layer with accumulated clay particles horizons the organic matter content was lower in highly eroded parts of the transect samples in comparison to those at the summit and toeslope zádorová et al 2014 2015 vašát et al 2017a c although the soils in this transect like the soils in the brumovice locality were also developed on a loess substrate the bulk densities fig s1 soil hydraulic parameters fig 1 table s1 and scaling factors fig 4 table s3 show different trends this is likely because the natural physical quality of a horizons of luvisols is worse than that of chernozems i e soil structure forming factors are less favorable in luvisols than in chernozems iuss working group wrb 2015 thus the development of soil structure in luvisols is less pronounced than in chermozems for instance the samples from the luvisol area had a finer texture and contained less organic matter fig s2 than those from the chernozem area in addition topsoil at the backslope included material from the bt horizon the typical features of this horizon are clay accumulation as mentioned above the development of clay coating and infillings and the formation of relatively stable soil aggregates kodešová et al 2009 which could considerably modify soil pore systems the topsoil at the toeslope and partly also footslope was amended with eroded soil material from the upslope surface layers i e material of better quality from the original a horizon mixed with some material from the subsurface horizon from eroded parts of the transect zádorová et al 2014 2015 which could lead to better conditions for the development of soil structure another reason for the different trends at both loess locations could be that the time between soil processing and harvest was much longer in the chernozem location than in the luvisol location table 1 that is soil structure development took longer and the soil structure forming process included not only factors that occurred during the vegetation period but also during the late autumn winter and early spring strudley et al 2008 furthermore studies were carried out during different years among others jirků et al 2013 showed that the development of a soil porous structure at periodically tilled surface horizons of a studied haplic luvisol greyic phaeozem and haplic cambisol as well as trends in soil hydraulic parameters during the vegetation period were strongly affected by climatic conditions during the particular year and considerably differed over the course of 4 consecutive years due to the different texture and structure compositions along the transect in the luvisol area the higher values of ρd and correspondingly the lower θ s values were found in the middle part of the transect compared to those at the summit and toeslope the lowest values of n were also found in the middle for samples taken after sowing statistical analyses showed that the sampling position significantly affected these three values table s4 but no other soil hydraulic parameters a comparison of values obtained after sowing and after harvest fig s1 1 table s1 showed aggravation of the soil structure at sampling points 1 2 and 3 i e higher ρd and lower θ s α and ks and improvement of the soil structure at sampling points 4 and 5 i e lower ρd and higher θ s α and ks this can be explained by an accumulation of eroded soil material from the upslope surface layers at the lower part of the transect and related more favorable conditions for the development of soil structure during the vegetation season however differences between values obtained after sowing and after harvest were not statistically significant at a 95 confidence level the scaled h θ k θ and k h curves figs 3 and s4 table s3 did not match as well as in the chernozem area fig 2 the αh factors were calculated from the logarithm of h equation 4 table s3 equation 4a therefore the deviations of the scaled h values from each other were evenly distributed within the pressure head range fig 3 the αk factors were calculated directly from the k values equation 4 table s3 equation 4b consequently the scaled k values matched for water contents close to soil saturation fig 3 and differences in log k increased with decreasing k values fig s4 table s3 equation 4c figs 3 and s4 and table s3 also shows that scaled curves for the samples taken after harvest at sampling points 3 4 and 5 deviate from the other curves the reason for relatively large divergences in all scaled curves is that at the summit red dots the soil structure was mostly given by the natural conditions in the a horizon of luvisols and at the backslope blue and toeslope black the topsoil was considerably modified due to erosion and accumulation processes which was in detail discussed above as result the n values within the transect significantly differed table s4 thus in this case the scaling method based on the linear variability concept and the resulting scaling factors fig 4 seems to be less or even not suitable for interpreting the spatial and temporal variability of the soil hydraulic properties nevertheless it should be mentioned that the n values for some sampling points and particular sampling events also considerably differed table s1 therefore part of the uncertainty resulting from the interpretation of the properties at different points and times using the reference soil hydraulic properties table 1 and the scaling factors table s3 and fig 4 can be attributed to the natural variability in the properties of the specific soil materials it should be also noted that the n values describing the shape of the curves in the luvisol area 1 49 0 32 were lower than in the chernozem area 1 83 0 27 table s3 but the range of the n values was similar i e 1 14 and 1 11 for the luvisol and chernozem area respectively this finding may suggest that variability of n plays a greater role for the low n values i e gradual curves with respect to the application of the linear variability concept for scaling of soil properties than for the high n values i e pronounced s shape curves the scaling factors after the harvest in sampling points 1 2 and 3 fig 5 showed lower retention capacity worse aeration and lower infiltration ability i e lower αθ and αk and higher αh at sampling points 4 and 5 there was higher retention capacity better aeration and larger infiltration ability i e higher αθ and αk and lower αh compared to that after sowing statistical analyses did not reveal a statistically significant impact of sampling position and time table s5 3 3 the sedlčany and železná localities the cambisols regions the soil textures in the sedlčany and železná experimental fields were more diverse than those at the chermozem and luvisol locations fig s2 larger sand fractions were found at the bottom parts of both transects such texture distribution along the hillslope is typical in sandy soils zádorová and penížek 2018 a material from the subsurface layers e g b and c often mixed with a sourced material which was because of intense erosion and concentrated runoff derived from rills and gullies accumulated at the bottom parts of the transects in addition the texture at the bottom part was affected by the sorting of the material during its transport while sand particles were sedimented finer particles were further transported by surface runoff different trends were observed in the cox content fig s2 at the sedlčany locality the cox content decreased with decreasing elevation coarse textured soil sandy loam except for the loam at the backslope at the železná locality the cox content increased with decreasing elevation vašát et al 2017a moderately coarse textured soil loam this can be associated with the mobility of the organic matter which can more or less efficiently form complexes with other soil constituents the formation of soil structural elements in soils with a coarse grained texture soils of a low fraction of clay particles in sedlčany was less efficient therefore the soil organic matter was less preserved which could lead to its mineralization mobility and consequently to losses mayer et al 2019 mclauchlan 2006 muller and hoper 2004 six et al 2000 soil organic matter at the železná locality formed complexes with other soil components and migrated along the slope because of water erosion the temporal trends i e differences in the cox contents after sowing and harvest at both locations were also diffused however the cox content after the harvest at both localities was similar soil organic matter at the sedlčany location decreased during the winter time likely because of high precipitation and the coarse soil texture and increased during the vegetation period owing to fresh organic matter decay soil organic content at the železná locality was considerably higher after sowing than after harvest this is explained by the rate of fresh organic matter decay which differs in different substrates and climates mayer et al 2019 sun et al 2020 it has been documented for instance by jirků et al 2013 that an organic matter content in cambisols can be much higher than in loess substrate soils but the quality of the soil organic matter is much worse the decomposition of the organic matter during the winter was likely much slower at the železná locality and accelerated during the vegetation period jirků et al 2013 also showed that the annual trends in the organic matter content can differ during different years therefore differences in the annual trends could be attributed to the different climatic conditions during the two years i e 2012 for sedlčany and 2013 for železná localities the soil hydraulic parameters for the sedlčany locality fig 1 mostly did not show any trends within the transects and time except for a decreasing trend in the θ s values with decreasing elevation which corresponds to the increasing bulk densities i e decreasing porosity with elevation table s4 at the železná location the values of α n and ks mostly decreased in time table s4 indicating an increased water retention capacity as well as aggravation of soil aeration and infiltration ability the scaled h θ k θ and k h curves figs 3 and s4 table s3 did not match as well as in the chernozem area fig 2 but did match better than those in the luvisol area in addition the differences between the scaled k θ and k h curves for the sedlčany locality were smaller than that for the železná locality the average n values plus minus standard deviations and ranges for sedlčany and železná were 1 78 0 28 and 1 38 0 19 and 0 96 and 0 78 respectively table s2 in both cases the differences in the n values within the transect and time were not statistically significant table s4 these numbers again show that although the variability of n for the železná locality was lower than that for the sedlčany locality the agreement of curves with the larger n values sedlčany was better than those of the lower n values železná the scaling factors for the sedlčany locality did not show any trends within the transect and time all values mostly varied close to one this suggests that in sandy soils the variability of the soil hydraulic properties is random that is there is no spatial or temporal dependence the scaling factors for the železná locality also did not show any trends within the transect however they show mostly aggravation of soil physical and hydraulic conditions in time similar to the upper part of the vidim transect that is worse aeration and lower infiltration ability significantly lower αk and significantly higher αh table s5 3 4 the hostouň locality the leptosol region leptosols are the least developed soil types the soil texture within the transect was similar except for the backslope position the higher sand content at the backslope could be owing to the incorporation of rock fragments from the weathered bedrock which was close to the surface at this position there were no trends in the cox and ρd values along the transect however the cox and ρd values decreased mostly and increased over time respectively the values of soil hydraulic parameters showed similar trends to those for the železná location that is the values of α n and ks mostly decreased over time scaled h θ k θ and k h curves figs 3 and s4 table s3 did not match as well as in the chernozem area the deviation of the scaled curves can be attributed to the high variability of the moderate value of n 1 59 0 29 range of 1 28 table s2 and to the fact that the n values from two sampling events significantly differ table s4 the scaling factors did not show any trends within the transect however they did show the aggravation of soil physical and hydraulic conditions in time similar to that at the železná transect and the upper part of the vidim transect i e worse aeration and lower infiltration ability significantly lower αθ significantly higher αh and not significantly lower αk table s5 3 5 water regime within the theoretical transect the water content and pressure head distributions fig 5 illustrate the progress of the wetting front after 4 days of constant precipitation of 1 cm day 1 although the αk values i e hydraulic conductivities after sowing were lower than the αk values after the harvest both the water content and pressure head distributions after sowing showed deeper wetting compared to that after harvest the reasons for this are the lower and higher values of αθ and αh after sowing than after harvest that is the different shapes of the soil water retention curves for instance the water content distribution within depths simulated between 300 and 1000 cm of the transect for the scaling factors after sowing is more gradual than that between 0 and 300 cm and the corresponding water content distribution simulated using the scaling factors after harvest it should be noted that after 4 days the wetting front had already reached the subsurface layer at a depth of 50 cm the graphs showing the distribution of the pressure heads in the surface layer 0 50 cm cannot show a distribution similar to the soil water content owing to the wider range of pressure heads and diverse distributions resulting from the nonlinear s shaped relationship between the pressure heads and soil water contents however the pressure heads at selected depths between 25 and 50 cm of the surface horizon also illustrate different trends in the pressure head distributions simulated for two sampling events that is less diverse progress of the wetting front simulated using the harvest data compared to the simulated results using the sowing data it should be noted that the variable soil hydraulic properties in the surface layer could also be set directly in this case 21 materials would be delineated within the top 50 cm of the surface layer for which 21 sets of the van genuchten parameters would be defined the advantage of the applied procedure is the setting of only one set of soil hydraulic parameters for this layer in this case the pressure heads within the flow region that are solved during each iteration step are converted using the scaling factor αh to the reference pressure heads h next the reference conductivities k reference water content θ and reference soil water capacities c are obtained from the h values and reference functions k h θ h and c h then the k θ and c values are scaled back to real values and the calculation continues in contrast three scaling factors αh αk and αθ vogel at al 1991 must be assigned to all elements i e in our case to 21 delineated segments of the top layer instead of the delineation of material distribution the necessity of obtaining and handling 3 different scaling factors is likely the reason why previous studies which were focused on the scaling of soil hydraulic properties montzka et al 2017 nasta et al 2013b mostly used the simpler approach proposed by miller and miller 1956 modified for instance by warrick et al 1977 or kosugi and hopmans 1998 which assumes one scaling factor for both h and k variables however the approach of the three scaling factors proposed by vogel et al 1991 allows for a closer agreement between the scaled soil hydraulic curves another advantage of the procedure applied in our study is that the van genuchten soil hydraulic parameters are related thus the average values of soil hydraulic parameters and their interpolation within the transect would likely be incorrect for instance zhu and mohanty 2002 showed that using average values of α and n for the simulation of water flow in soils can lead to high uncertainty therefore scaling factors are recommended to interpret the variability of soil hydraulic properties montzka et al 2017 4 conclusions the study focused on the evaluation of the spatial and temporal variability of the soil hydraulic properties at 5 morphologically diverse study sites with various soil units the study showed that while the sampling position significantly affected only the ρd and θ s values and αθ for both cambisols the sampling day affected a wider range of soil parameters and scaling factors it was observed that in soils of a better chemical physical and biological quality e g soils derived from the chernozem the variability of soil parameters and scaling factor can be explained by the position within the transect and development of soil structure during the vegetation period in contrast in soils of considerably worse conditions e g soils derived from the cambisol on granodiorite and shale which contained a high fraction of sand particles the spatial and temporal variability was random due to the low number of sampling spots and measurements the soil hydraulic parameters and scaling factors were not related to terrain attributes more extensive studies e g a higher density of sampling points and sampling in several adjacent transects are needed to reveal possible relationships it was shown that scaling of the soil hydraulic properties did not always lead to a close overlap of the scaled the h θ k θ and k h curves which was attributed to the high variability of the n values i e assumptions for the linear variability concept were not fulfilled however the deviation of the scaled curve decreased with the increasing average n value it was also noted that a part of the uncertainty resulting from the interpretation of the properties with the variable n values at different sampling points and times using the evaluated reference soil hydraulic properties and the scaling factors can be attributed to the natural variability in the properties at the particular sampling points and times it was suggested that using the reference soil hydraulic properties and 3 scaling factors proposed by vogel et al 1991 interpolated within the simplified soil transect for the chernozem area is a more suitable approach to characterize the hydraulic properties of the flow domain in the hydrus 2d program than using interpolated soil hydraulic parameters which can lead to a high uncertainty zhu and mohanty 2002 the evaluated trends can help to more reliably assess the hydrological conditions within the area however further studies are needed to validate this approach for real field conditions i e actual terrain the thickness of soil horizons climatic data plants measured soil water contents pressure heads etc in addition a different approach should probably be used to set the scaling factors within the flow domain at locations where the variability of soil hydraulic parameters and scaling factors is random credit authorship contribution

4961,extensive agricultural use of land coupled with intensive water erosion at geomorphologically diverse areas with uniform soil substrate and originally similar soils can lead to high diversity in soil types and correspondingly to a high spatial and temporal variability of soil properties including soil hydraulic properties therefore this study aimed to propose a procedure to characterize the variability of soil hydraulic properties of topsoils and the soil water regime soil hydraulic properties were measured after sowing and harvesting at 5 sampling points of 1 elevation transect at 5 experimental areas with diverse soil types the reference soil hydraulic properties and 3 scaling factors related to the pressure head αh water content αθ and hydraulic conductivity αk were used to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of soil hydraulic properties the best correspondence between scaled soil hydraulic curves was observed for the chernozem area followed by the two haplic cambisols areas leptosol area and luvisol area in general matching of the scaled curves increased with a decreasing variability of n values i e increasing similarity of a soil pore space geometry and increasing average n values e g for pronounced s shape soil water retention curves the sampling day significantly affected αh αk and αθ in the chernozem area αh and αk in the cambisol developed on shale area and αh and αθ in the leptosol area while values for the chernozem area indicated an improvement in soil hydrological conditions during the vegetation period the values for the luvisol leptosol and cambisol developed on shale areas indicated aggravation no considerable changes were observed for the cambisol developed on granodiorite and shale areas the sampling position significantly affected αθ in both the cambisol areas at some locations e g chernozem area the spatial variability reflected different erosion accumulation processes within the transect to illustrate a practical application of the scaling factors at such locations the scaling factors obtained for the chernozem area were linearly interpolated within the surface layer of the theoretical vertical two layer soil transect and hydrus 2d program was used to simulate water flow in the surface 50 cm layer the results showed a more gradual wetting front after sowing than after harvesting keywords soil diversification soil water retention curve soil hydraulic conductivity curve hydrus program mathematical modeling 1 introduction knowledge of soil hydraulic properties that is soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves is essential when assessing soil water regimes which affect plant growth yield agrochemicals and contaminant transport in soils and their potential leakage toward groundwater the soil structure and consequently soil hydraulic properties of tilled soil vary in space and time strudley et al 2008 chandrasekhar et al 2018 the spatial variability of soil properties within the sloping area may be enhanced by water erosion processes i e soil material loss at steep parts and its accumulation at concave and bottom parts which may even lead to soil type diversification there are several studies which showed the dependence of selected soil properties on some terrain characteristics e g depth of topsoil horizon lark and beckett 1998 mayer et al 2019

or near saturated hydraulic conductivity alletto and coquet 2009 alletto et al 2015 bamberg et al 2011 bodner et al 2008 bormann and klaasen 2008 sacco et al 2012 as well as both soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity mubarak et al 2009a 2009b šípek et al 2019 the long term variability of both hydraulic properties was documented within three and four years period by schwen et al 2011a schwen et al 2011b and jirků et al 2013 respectively the variability of soil hydraulic properties may be assessed using scaling factors the original scaling theory assumed the geometric similarity of the studied soils miller and miller 1956 among others sadeghi et al 2016 documented that the validity of the pore space similarity assumption for a set of soils can be evaluated based on the equality of the shape parameters of their hydraulic functions they also showed that similarity of pore space geometry is not the sole required condition for validity of the miller miller theory because the interrelation is also dependent on solid liquid interactions there have been several approaches for the further extension of this method for dissimilar soils and improvement of this technique assuming different sets of scaling factors various equations for hydraulic function fitting assuming additional information about soil geometry such as fractal dimension and soil texture clausnitzer et al 1992 fallico et al 2010 hopmans 1987 kosugi and hopmans 1998 nasta et al 2013a simmons et al 1979 tuli et al 2001 veltri et al 2013 vereecken et al 2007 vogel et al 1991 warrick et al 1977 scaling factors have been used not only to describe areal variability but also to interpret variability within the soil profile schwen et al 2014 there have been few attempts to use scaling techniques to characterize the variability of soil hydraulic properties within a larger area of diverse soil types nasta et al 2009 successfully applied the scaling approach combined with information about the particle size distribution used for separation of soils with different textures to determine variability in water retention in diverse soils within a catchment area of about 32 km2 nasta et al 2013b used the same approach to interpret the areal variability of a scale factor at the hillslope scale montzka et al 2017 used a scaling approach to interpret a sub grid variance in a global data set of soil hydraulic properties variable soil hydraulic properties strongly affect water flow in soils although scaling factors seem to be more suitable for interpreting variable water regimes than the original soil hydraulic characteristics montzka et al 2017 their utilization is not frequent the impact of spatial variability on water flow nasta et al 2013b has been demonstrated using results from a set of 1d simulation scenarios characterized by various scaling factors proposed by warrick et al 1977 a further set of scenarios defined by various sets of soil hydraulic parameters but not scaling factors were presented by šípek et al 2019 temporal variability has been included in 1d simulation scenarios assuming variable sets of soil hydraulic parameters in predefined periods alletto et al 2015 schwen et al 2011a šípek and tesař 2017 šípek et al 2019 the impact of spatially correlated ks values within the vertical 2d flow domain on hillslope hydrology was documented by cai et al 2017 to our knowledge no study has evaluated the spatial and temporal variability of soil hydraulic properties within an area heavily affected by soil erosion where the original soil type was dependent on terrain position transformed into several different soil types and studies using a scaling technique to interpret the variability of soil hydraulic properties at such locations therefore the goals of this study were to determine 1 whether at such locations general trends in the development of soil hydraulic properties along the slope and in time can be identified or whether these trends are soil type specific and 2 whether the scaling technique is a suitable approach to describe the variability of soil hydraulic properties and water regime in soils at different localities to this end the study set out to 1 select 5 locations with different original soil types or substrates which were strongly modified because of erosion 2 delineate elevation transects which cover the possibly largest differences in soil properties within the area 3 evaluate soil hydraulic properties within selected elevation transects after sowing and after harvesting 4 use scaling factors to characterize the variability of soil hydraulic properties within the transect separately for each sampling date and together for both sampling dates and 5 illustrate the impact of the spatial and temporal variability of the resulting scaling factors on a water flow within the theoretical 2d soil transect simulated with the hydrus 2d program 2 material and methods 2 1 study areas soil sampling and basic soil properties the study was performed on five morphologically diverse study sites table 1 conventional tillage has long been applied at all locations the original soil units haplic chernozem haplic

haplic phaeozem colluvic base slope and the tributary valley respectively iuss working group wrb 2015 diverse soil conditions at the brumovice locality were described by jakšík et al 2015 2016 sagova mareckova et al 2016 vašát et al 2014 vašát et al 2015a 2015b 2017a 2017b 2017c and zádorová et al 2011a 2011b 2013 2015 at the vidim locality by penížek et al 2016 zádorová et al 2014 2015 vašát et al 2017a vašát et al 2017c at the sedlčany locality adjacent field by zádorová et al 2015 and at localities železná and hostouň by vašát et al 2017a vašát et al 2017c one representative transect with the most diverse terrain attributes elevation slope curvature exposition etc which caused the most variable soil properties was delineated at each location for this purpose digital elevation models were used first the summit of the transect was delineated at the area least impacted by erosion processes next the function create steepest path in arcgis 10 esri 2011 was used to delineate the transect topographic derivatives were calculated using integrated algorithms implemented in arcgis 10 based on this information five sampling points fig s1 were selected at each transect assuming that the soil at different points would be modified by the different stages of the erosion accumulation processes grundwald 2005 miller and schaetzl 2015 1 summit 2 shoulder 3 backslope 4 footslope and 5 toeslope it should be noted that it was not always possible to delineate an ideal hillslope transect in which the characteristics of the terrain would exactly correspond to the definition of individual sections on the slope for instance the toeslope part where the gradient should be only slightly inclined or nearly leveled was not always clearly developed nevertheless the fifth point was defined at the lowest point of the valley or the edge of the plot similarly other points were defined to consider as far as possible the different characteristics of the hillslope the pilot experiment was carried out at the brumovice locality which is the most explored locality out of all 5 localities it has been showed e g jirků et al 2013 that soil properties of topsoil of periodically tiled soils vary greatly throughout the year and that trends in changes in soil properties may vary from year to year therefore we selected two sampling dates to study the most diverse limit conditions during the plant growth periods i e the most destructed soil after soil processing and the most consolidated soil at the end of the vegetation season soil samples were taken from the surface layer 0 25 cm after sowing winter wheat autumn 2010 and after harvest summer 2011 at the other 4 localities samples were taken after crop sowing and harvest during the following 2 years table 1 grab soil samples and 3 undisturbed 100 cm3 soil samples soil core height of 5 1 cm and cross sectional area of 19 60 cm2 per spot and sampling day were taken in the surface horizons grab soils were air dried ground and sifted through a 2 mm sieve the oxidable organic carbon content cox was determined oxidimetrically skjemstad and baldock 2008 fig s2 the particle size distribution fractions of clay silt and sand was determined only on the summer samples no temporal changes were expected using a sedimentation method gee and or 2002 fig s2 the undisturbed soil samples were used to measure bulk density ρd fig s2 using standard methods dane and topp 2002 and soil hydraulic properties 2 2 soil hydraulic properties soil hydraulic properties were studied in the laboratory with undisturbed 100 cm3 soil samples placed in tempe cells using the multi step outflow test van dam et al 1994 initially fully saturated soil samples placed in the tempe cells were slowly drained using 9 pressure head steps a minimum pressure head h of 1000 cm during a 3 week period cumulative outflow in time was measured the soil water content corresponding to the applied pressure heads at the steady state i e when no outflow was observed at the end of each pressure head step was evaluated using the final soil water content and water balance within the soil sample next the single porosity model in hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2018a was applied to simulate the observed multi step outflow and water contents and to obtain the parameters of both soil hydraulic properties soil water retention curve θ h and the hydraulic conductivity function k θ described by the analytical expressions proposed by van genuchten 1980 1 θ e θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m h 0 θ e θ s h 0 2 k θ k s θ e l 1 1 θ e 1 m m 2 h 0 k θ k s h 0 where θe is the effective soil water content dimensionless ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 θr and θs are the residual and saturated soil water contents l3l 3 respectively l is the pore connectivity parameter dimensionless α is the reciprocal of the air entry pressure l 1 n dimensionless is related to the slope of the retention curve at the inflection point and m 1 1 n dimensionless the θs values were set at the measured values the l values were set to 0 5 mualem 1976 the values of θr α n and ks were optimized using the numerical inversion in hydrus 1d fig 1 table s1 and s2 2 3 scaling factors the scaling approach proposed by vogel et al 1991 was used to characterize the variability of soil hydraulic properties within each transect 3 α h h h α k k k α θ θ θ r θ θ r where αh αk and αθ are the scaling factors and represents values of the reference soil hydraulic properties θ h and k h respectively there are different approaches to obtaining these values and characteristics both the scaling factors and reference characteristics may be derived from m soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves consisting of n data points using the least squares minimization as follows i 1 m j 1 n log h j θ j α hi log h ij θ ij 2 m i n θ j θ r θ ij θ ri α θ i where α θ i θ si θ ri θ s θ r θ s 1 m i θ si θ r 1 m i θ ri 4 i 1 m j 1 n k j h j α ki k ij h ij 2 m i n in our case reference characteristics were alternatively computed by fitting the data points of all soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves using the retc program van genuchten et al 1991 table 2 next the scaling factors were calculated for each experimental curve θ h and k h using the least squares minimization equations 4 table s3 equations 4a and 4b both hydraulic properties were obtained via the optimization of the van genuchten parameters equations 1 and 2 i e characteristics were not described by measured data points given by θ h and k values therefore data points corresponding to the applied pressure heads were first calculated using equations 1 and 2 see figs 2 3 s3 and s4 and then analyzed using the scaling technique for the brumovice locality the shapes of the soil hydraulic properties figs 2 and s3 obtained from the different sampling events differed the shape parameters n describing curvatures of the soil hydraulic properties were 1 74 0 23 and 1 93 0 28 table s2 for sampling after sowing and after harvest respectively therefore scaling factors were calculated separately for each sampling day fig 4 and table s3 which agreed with a procedure applied for instance by sadeghi et al 2016 who divided soil hydraulic curves according their shape parameters σ of the kosugi 1994 function and next applied miller and miller 1956 approach for their scaling however the evaluated scaling factors fig 4 and table s3 elucidated only the spatial variability of the soil hydraulic properties for each sampling since one of the goals was to find out if the scaling technique can be applied to characterize the general variability i e the coupled spatial and temporal variabilities of the soil properties in a particular area and to illustrate possible inaccuracies resulted from the application of the linear variability concept for the curves of a greater variability of the n values the scaling factors were also calculated for both sampling days together fig 4 and table s3 due to same reason the scaling factors for other localities were calculated only using data from both sampling events fig 4 table s3 2 4 statistical analyses the average values and standard deviations were calculated at each sampling point and sampling day for all evaluated soil properties van genuchten hydraulic parameters and scaling factors the normality of the data sets was tested by calculating the standardized skewness and standardized kurtosis the main effect analysis of variance anova was then used to assess differences between the soil properties evaluated along the delineated transects i e the impact of sampling position and for different sampling days i e after sowing and after harvest homogeneous data groups were discriminated using duncan s multiple comparison procedure analyses were performed using the statistical software statistica statsoft inc 2013 2 5 using scaling factors for mathematical modeling with hydrus it is assumed that under certain initial and boundary conditions the water flow within the soil profile can be simulated using the richards equation based model e g hydrus 1d and the reference soil hydraulic properties vogel et al 1991 next if similarity conditions are met the dynamic variables for other profiles i e of other soil hydraulic properties can be calculated from the reference dynamic variables and scaling factors for time and space derived from the scaling factors equations 3 however scaling factors can also be used to describe the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties within the flow domain which is even a better practical application of the scaling technique to present a possible implementation of the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties i e scaling factors obtained for the brumovice locality into mathematical model and to illustrate impact of this variability on the water regime in soils the hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2018b model was applied to simulate water flow within the theoretical 2d vertical soil transect this theoretical transect differed from the original sampling transect fig s1 to better show the diverse water distribution in the surface horizon the thickness of the surface horizon of the original transect varied between 40 cm summit 25 cm eroded parts and more than 80 cm bottom of the transect which is considerably less than the transect length of 9000 cm and elevation of 1300 cm and therefore the resulting graphs characterizing water flow in such two dimensional transect would not be illustrative the surface of the theoretical transect was horizontal the length and depth of the transect were 1050 cm and 200 cm respectively the finite element mesh was rectangular 105 horizontal and 50 vertical elements the relative sizes of the elements were 0 1 and 1 at the surface and bottom respectively two layers of different soil properties were delineated 1 surface layer a horizon thickness of 50 cm θr 0 194 cm3cm 3 θs 0 401 cm3cm 3 α 0 019 cm 1 n 1 699 and ks 0 405 cm h 1 i e reference values resulting from both sampling events in table 2 and 2 subsurface loess layer c horizon thickness of 150 cm θr 0 030 cm3cm 3 θs 0 445 cm3cm 3 α 0 038 cm 1 n 1 38 and ks 0 350 cm h 1 i e representative values obtained for loess substrate using the multi step outflow method to introduce the horizontal spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties after sowing or after the harvest the surface layer was divided into 21 vertical segments width of 50 cm the scaling factors αh αk and αθ fig 4 and table s3 obtained for sampling point 1 were set in the 1st segment from the left for point 2 in the 6th segment for point 3 in the 11th segment for point 4 in 16th segment and for point 5 in the 21st segment the values for the other segments i e the constant values of the 3 scaling factors for each segment linearly increased or decreased between set values for the sampling points the initial conditions were set as pressure heads of 1000 cm the atmospheric boundary was set at the top constant precipitation of 1 cm per day and no evaporation the free drainage was set at the bottom the simulation lasted 4 days no transpiration that is no root uptake after sowing or harvest was assumed 3 results and discussion 3 1 the brumovice locality the chernozem region the soil texture fig s2 did not considerably differ along the transect a larger fraction of silt was observed at the greater slope in the middle of the transect likely because of the loess substrate which was plowing mixed into the surface horizon the largest cox content fig s2 was measured at the summit decreased with decreasing elevation because of erosion and increased at the bottom because of the accumulation of soil material eroded from the upper part of the transect which was in this area documented before by jakšík et al 2015 2016 vašát et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2017a b c and zádorová et al 2011a b 2013 2015 the cox content measured after sowing and harvest did not differ considerably the trend in the bulk densities fig s2 increased with the decreasing elevation which can indicate aggravation in soil structure due to erosion accumulation processes jakšík et al 2015 zádorová et al 2011b the ρd values measured after harvest were significantly table s4 lower than those measured after sowing which can be explained by the development of the soil structure during the vegetation period that is by the increased fraction of large capillary pores and thus the entire soil porosity fér et al 2016 2020 jakšík et al 2015 jirků et al 2013 kodešová et al 2011 pavlů et al 2021 this effect was confirmed by the resulting soil hydraulic parameters fig 1 table s1 that is by the significantly table s4 larger values of θs α and ks and not significantly larger values of n obtained after harvest than those after sowing according to the increasing trend in the bulk densities with the decreasing elevation fig s2 the trends in θ s α and ks and n fig 1 table s1 decreased and increased respectively however the sampling position did not have a statistically significant effect on these values except θ s at a 95 confidence level table s4 fig 2 shows that the soil water retention curves h θ which were scaled using the scaling factors fig 4 table s3 for samples after sowing matched better than the curves after harvest despite the scaling factors from the sowing event being more variable than those from the harvest event the high variability of the scaling factors was caused by soil disturbance due to soil processing the lower variability but slightly higher differences in scaled curves can be explained by soil consolidation and slightly different soil pore structure features developed at different positions of the transect resulted from diverse processes in different soil units table 1 in contrast the scaled hydraulic conductivity curves k θ and k h figs 2 and s3 for samples from the harvest event matched better than those from the sowing event the soil water retention and the hydraulic conductivity curves figs 2 and s3 which were scaled using the scaling factors obtained from both sets of the soil hydraulic properties were more spread than when analyzed separately for each sampling due to the differences in the n values from both sets and thus the larger variability of the n values tables s1 and s2 however the differences between the scaled curves are not large if the variability of the n values for each sampling point and time i e the natural variability of specific soil materials table s1 and the fact that the differences in the n values were not statistically significant table s4 is considered the error due to the variability of the n values in transect and time is small thus the scaling method and resulting scaling factors fig 4 seem to be acceptable for describing the spatial and temporal variability of the soil hydraulic properties within this region the values of αθ and αk after harvest were significantly higher than after sowing tables s3 and s5 the values of αh after harvest were significantly lower than after the sowing tables s3 and s5 this is consistent with the observed trends in the bulk densities and soil hydraulic properties figs s1 1 table s1 that is soils after harvest showed a higher retention capacity better aeration and larger infiltration ability than soils after sowing the sampling position did not have a statistically significant effect on all 3 scaling factors at a 95 confidence level table s5 3 2 the vidim locality the luvisol region the soil texture was more diverse than that at the chermozem location samples from sampling points 1 2 and 3 contained larger fractions of clay in comparison to the clay content from the sampling points 4 and 5 likely because of mixing material from the a and bt i e an illuvial layer with accumulated clay particles horizons the organic matter content was lower in highly eroded parts of the transect samples in comparison to those at the summit and toeslope zádorová et al 2014 2015 vašát et al 2017a c although the soils in this transect like the soils in the brumovice locality were also developed on a loess substrate the bulk densities fig s1 soil hydraulic parameters fig 1 table s1 and scaling factors fig 4 table s3 show different trends this is likely because the natural physical quality of a horizons of luvisols is worse than that of chernozems i e soil structure forming factors are less favorable in luvisols than in chernozems iuss working group wrb 2015 thus the development of soil structure in luvisols is less pronounced than in chermozems for instance the samples from the luvisol area had a finer texture and contained less organic matter fig s2 than those from the chernozem area in addition topsoil at the backslope included material from the bt horizon the typical features of this horizon are clay accumulation as mentioned above the development of clay coating and infillings and the formation of relatively stable soil aggregates kodešová et al 2009 which could considerably modify soil pore systems the topsoil at the toeslope and partly also footslope was amended with eroded soil material from the upslope surface layers i e material of better quality from the original a horizon mixed with some material from the subsurface horizon from eroded parts of the transect zádorová et al 2014 2015 which could lead to better conditions for the development of soil structure another reason for the different trends at both loess locations could be that the time between soil processing and harvest was much longer in the chernozem location than in the luvisol location table 1 that is soil structure development took longer and the soil structure forming process included not only factors that occurred during the vegetation period but also during the late autumn winter and early spring strudley et al 2008 furthermore studies were carried out during different years among others jirků et al 2013 showed that the development of a soil porous structure at periodically tilled surface horizons of a studied haplic luvisol greyic phaeozem and haplic cambisol as well as trends in soil hydraulic parameters during the vegetation period were strongly affected by climatic conditions during the particular year and considerably differed over the course of 4 consecutive years due to the different texture and structure compositions along the transect in the luvisol area the higher values of ρd and correspondingly the lower θ s values were found in the middle part of the transect compared to those at the summit and toeslope the lowest values of n were also found in the middle for samples taken after sowing statistical analyses showed that the sampling position significantly affected these three values table s4 but no other soil hydraulic parameters a comparison of values obtained after sowing and after harvest fig s1 1 table s1 showed aggravation of the soil structure at sampling points 1 2 and 3 i e higher ρd and lower θ s α and ks and improvement of the soil structure at sampling points 4 and 5 i e lower ρd and higher θ s α and ks this can be explained by an accumulation of eroded soil material from the upslope surface layers at the lower part of the transect and related more favorable conditions for the development of soil structure during the vegetation season however differences between values obtained after sowing and after harvest were not statistically significant at a 95 confidence level the scaled h θ k θ and k h curves figs 3 and s4 table s3 did not match as well as in the chernozem area fig 2 the αh factors were calculated from the logarithm of h equation 4 table s3 equation 4a therefore the deviations of the scaled h values from each other were evenly distributed within the pressure head range fig 3 the αk factors were calculated directly from the k values equation 4 table s3 equation 4b consequently the scaled k values matched for water contents close to soil saturation fig 3 and differences in log k increased with decreasing k values fig s4 table s3 equation 4c figs 3 and s4 and table s3 also shows that scaled curves for the samples taken after harvest at sampling points 3 4 and 5 deviate from the other curves the reason for relatively large divergences in all scaled curves is that at the summit red dots the soil structure was mostly given by the natural conditions in the a horizon of luvisols and at the backslope blue and toeslope black the topsoil was considerably modified due to erosion and accumulation processes which was in detail discussed above as result the n values within the transect significantly differed table s4 thus in this case the scaling method based on the linear variability concept and the resulting scaling factors fig 4 seems to be less or even not suitable for interpreting the spatial and temporal variability of the soil hydraulic properties nevertheless it should be mentioned that the n values for some sampling points and particular sampling events also considerably differed table s1 therefore part of the uncertainty resulting from the interpretation of the properties at different points and times using the reference soil hydraulic properties table 1 and the scaling factors table s3 and fig 4 can be attributed to the natural variability in the properties of the specific soil materials it should be also noted that the n values describing the shape of the curves in the luvisol area 1 49 0 32 were lower than in the chernozem area 1 83 0 27 table s3 but the range of the n values was similar i e 1 14 and 1 11 for the luvisol and chernozem area respectively this finding may suggest that variability of n plays a greater role for the low n values i e gradual curves with respect to the application of the linear variability concept for scaling of soil properties than for the high n values i e pronounced s shape curves the scaling factors after the harvest in sampling points 1 2 and 3 fig 5 showed lower retention capacity worse aeration and lower infiltration ability i e lower αθ and αk and higher αh at sampling points 4 and 5 there was higher retention capacity better aeration and larger infiltration ability i e higher αθ and αk and lower αh compared to that after sowing statistical analyses did not reveal a statistically significant impact of sampling position and time table s5 3 3 the sedlčany and železná localities the cambisols regions the soil textures in the sedlčany and železná experimental fields were more diverse than those at the chermozem and luvisol locations fig s2 larger sand fractions were found at the bottom parts of both transects such texture distribution along the hillslope is typical in sandy soils zádorová and penížek 2018 a material from the subsurface layers e g b and c often mixed with a sourced material which was because of intense erosion and concentrated runoff derived from rills and gullies accumulated at the bottom parts of the transects in addition the texture at the bottom part was affected by the sorting of the material during its transport while sand particles were sedimented finer particles were further transported by surface runoff different trends were observed in the cox content fig s2 at the sedlčany locality the cox content decreased with decreasing elevation coarse textured soil sandy loam except for the loam at the backslope at the železná locality the cox content increased with decreasing elevation vašát et al 2017a moderately coarse textured soil loam this can be associated with the mobility of the organic matter which can more or less efficiently form complexes with other soil constituents the formation of soil structural elements in soils with a coarse grained texture soils of a low fraction of clay particles in sedlčany was less efficient therefore the soil organic matter was less preserved which could lead to its mineralization mobility and consequently to losses mayer et al 2019 mclauchlan 2006 muller and hoper 2004 six et al 2000 soil organic matter at the železná locality formed complexes with other soil components and migrated along the slope because of water erosion the temporal trends i e differences in the cox contents after sowing and harvest at both locations were also diffused however the cox content after the harvest at both localities was similar soil organic matter at the sedlčany location decreased during the winter time likely because of high precipitation and the coarse soil texture and increased during the vegetation period owing to fresh organic matter decay soil organic content at the železná locality was considerably higher after sowing than after harvest this is explained by the rate of fresh organic matter decay which differs in different substrates and climates mayer et al 2019 sun et al 2020 it has been documented for instance by jirků et al 2013 that an organic matter content in cambisols can be much higher than in loess substrate soils but the quality of the soil organic matter is much worse the decomposition of the organic matter during the winter was likely much slower at the železná locality and accelerated during the vegetation period jirků et al 2013 also showed that the annual trends in the organic matter content can differ during different years therefore differences in the annual trends could be attributed to the different climatic conditions during the two years i e 2012 for sedlčany and 2013 for železná localities the soil hydraulic parameters for the sedlčany locality fig 1 mostly did not show any trends within the transects and time except for a decreasing trend in the θ s values with decreasing elevation which corresponds to the increasing bulk densities i e decreasing porosity with elevation table s4 at the železná location the values of α n and ks mostly decreased in time table s4 indicating an increased water retention capacity as well as aggravation of soil aeration and infiltration ability the scaled h θ k θ and k h curves figs 3 and s4 table s3 did not match as well as in the chernozem area fig 2 but did match better than those in the luvisol area in addition the differences between the scaled k θ and k h curves for the sedlčany locality were smaller than that for the železná locality the average n values plus minus standard deviations and ranges for sedlčany and železná were 1 78 0 28 and 1 38 0 19 and 0 96 and 0 78 respectively table s2 in both cases the differences in the n values within the transect and time were not statistically significant table s4 these numbers again show that although the variability of n for the železná locality was lower than that for the sedlčany locality the agreement of curves with the larger n values sedlčany was better than those of the lower n values železná the scaling factors for the sedlčany locality did not show any trends within the transect and time all values mostly varied close to one this suggests that in sandy soils the variability of the soil hydraulic properties is random that is there is no spatial or temporal dependence the scaling factors for the železná locality also did not show any trends within the transect however they show mostly aggravation of soil physical and hydraulic conditions in time similar to the upper part of the vidim transect that is worse aeration and lower infiltration ability significantly lower αk and significantly higher αh table s5 3 4 the hostouň locality the leptosol region leptosols are the least developed soil types the soil texture within the transect was similar except for the backslope position the higher sand content at the backslope could be owing to the incorporation of rock fragments from the weathered bedrock which was close to the surface at this position there were no trends in the cox and ρd values along the transect however the cox and ρd values decreased mostly and increased over time respectively the values of soil hydraulic parameters showed similar trends to those for the železná location that is the values of α n and ks mostly decreased over time scaled h θ k θ and k h curves figs 3 and s4 table s3 did not match as well as in the chernozem area the deviation of the scaled curves can be attributed to the high variability of the moderate value of n 1 59 0 29 range of 1 28 table s2 and to the fact that the n values from two sampling events significantly differ table s4 the scaling factors did not show any trends within the transect however they did show the aggravation of soil physical and hydraulic conditions in time similar to that at the železná transect and the upper part of the vidim transect i e worse aeration and lower infiltration ability significantly lower αθ significantly higher αh and not significantly lower αk table s5 3 5 water regime within the theoretical transect the water content and pressure head distributions fig 5 illustrate the progress of the wetting front after 4 days of constant precipitation of 1 cm day 1 although the αk values i e hydraulic conductivities after sowing were lower than the αk values after the harvest both the water content and pressure head distributions after sowing showed deeper wetting compared to that after harvest the reasons for this are the lower and higher values of αθ and αh after sowing than after harvest that is the different shapes of the soil water retention curves for instance the water content distribution within depths simulated between 300 and 1000 cm of the transect for the scaling factors after sowing is more gradual than that between 0 and 300 cm and the corresponding water content distribution simulated using the scaling factors after harvest it should be noted that after 4 days the wetting front had already reached the subsurface layer at a depth of 50 cm the graphs showing the distribution of the pressure heads in the surface layer 0 50 cm cannot show a distribution similar to the soil water content owing to the wider range of pressure heads and diverse distributions resulting from the nonlinear s shaped relationship between the pressure heads and soil water contents however the pressure heads at selected depths between 25 and 50 cm of the surface horizon also illustrate different trends in the pressure head distributions simulated for two sampling events that is less diverse progress of the wetting front simulated using the harvest data compared to the simulated results using the sowing data it should be noted that the variable soil hydraulic properties in the surface layer could also be set directly in this case 21 materials would be delineated within the top 50 cm of the surface layer for which 21 sets of the van genuchten parameters would be defined the advantage of the applied procedure is the setting of only one set of soil hydraulic parameters for this layer in this case the pressure heads within the flow region that are solved during each iteration step are converted using the scaling factor αh to the reference pressure heads h next the reference conductivities k reference water content θ and reference soil water capacities c are obtained from the h values and reference functions k h θ h and c h then the k θ and c values are scaled back to real values and the calculation continues in contrast three scaling factors αh αk and αθ vogel at al 1991 must be assigned to all elements i e in our case to 21 delineated segments of the top layer instead of the delineation of material distribution the necessity of obtaining and handling 3 different scaling factors is likely the reason why previous studies which were focused on the scaling of soil hydraulic properties montzka et al 2017 nasta et al 2013b mostly used the simpler approach proposed by miller and miller 1956 modified for instance by warrick et al 1977 or kosugi and hopmans 1998 which assumes one scaling factor for both h and k variables however the approach of the three scaling factors proposed by vogel et al 1991 allows for a closer agreement between the scaled soil hydraulic curves another advantage of the procedure applied in our study is that the van genuchten soil hydraulic parameters are related thus the average values of soil hydraulic parameters and their interpolation within the transect would likely be incorrect for instance zhu and mohanty 2002 showed that using average values of α and n for the simulation of water flow in soils can lead to high uncertainty therefore scaling factors are recommended to interpret the variability of soil hydraulic properties montzka et al 2017 4 conclusions the study focused on the evaluation of the spatial and temporal variability of the soil hydraulic properties at 5 morphologically diverse study sites with various soil units the study showed that while the sampling position significantly affected only the ρd and θ s values and αθ for both cambisols the sampling day affected a wider range of soil parameters and scaling factors it was observed that in soils of a better chemical physical and biological quality e g soils derived from the chernozem the variability of soil parameters and scaling factor can be explained by the position within the transect and development of soil structure during the vegetation period in contrast in soils of considerably worse conditions e g soils derived from the cambisol on granodiorite and shale which contained a high fraction of sand particles the spatial and temporal variability was random due to the low number of sampling spots and measurements the soil hydraulic parameters and scaling factors were not related to terrain attributes more extensive studies e g a higher density of sampling points and sampling in several adjacent transects are needed to reveal possible relationships it was shown that scaling of the soil hydraulic properties did not always lead to a close overlap of the scaled the h θ k θ and k h curves which was attributed to the high variability of the n values i e assumptions for the linear variability concept were not fulfilled however the deviation of the scaled curve decreased with the increasing average n value it was also noted that a part of the uncertainty resulting from the interpretation of the properties with the variable n values at different sampling points and times using the evaluated reference soil hydraulic properties and the scaling factors can be attributed to the natural variability in the properties at the particular sampling points and times it was suggested that using the reference soil hydraulic properties and 3 scaling factors proposed by vogel et al 1991 interpolated within the simplified soil transect for the chernozem area is a more suitable approach to characterize the hydraulic properties of the flow domain in the hydrus 2d program than using interpolated soil hydraulic parameters which can lead to a high uncertainty zhu and mohanty 2002 the evaluated trends can help to more reliably assess the hydrological conditions within the area however further studies are needed to validate this approach for real field conditions i e actual terrain the thickness of soil horizons climatic data plants measured soil water contents pressure heads etc in addition a different approach should probably be used to set the scaling factors within the flow domain at locations where the variability of soil hydraulic parameters and scaling factors is random credit authorship contribution

4962,the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream i e sediment peak lagging behind flood peak are crucial for the operation of sediment peak release to reduce the sedimentation of the three gorges reservoir tgr in the flood season of 2013 the sediment peak regulation was conducted in the tgr based on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks and promising results were achieved towards reducing the reservoir sedimentation in this study the processes of flood propagation and sediment transport over a stretch of 280 km upstream of the tgr on the yangtze river were studied through a three dimensional 3d semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism focussing on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream it was demonstrated that firstly the model efficiently and accurately reproduced the processes of flood propagation and sediment transport during the 2013 flood season compared with the measured results the sensitivity analysis showed that the horizontal grid used in the numerical modelling had a greater influence on the model results than the vertical grid the manning coefficient was not sensitive to flood peaks propagation with a large flow discharge next the validated model was adopted to investigate the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks under different tgr operational scenarios the results indicated that the impounded level ahead of the three gorges dam tgd had an insignificant influence on the occurrence time and magnitude of the flood peak but had a significant influence on the occurrence time and magnitude of the sediment peak the time of sediment peak lagging behind flood peak increases as the impounded level in the tgr increased the peak value of sediment concentration gradually decreased owing to the sediment deposition the research results could provide a scientific basis for further optimising the sediment peak regulation and the 3d numerical model could provide a reliable real time tool to predict the arrival time of the flood and sediment peaks in the tgr keywords three gorges reservoir flood peak sediment peak sediment concentration reservoir sedimentation 1 introduction construction of dams changes the propagation characteristics of water and sediment transport through rivers as the impounded level ahead of the dams rises up and the flow velocity reduces resulting in reservoir sedimentation global annual reservoir storage loss owing to sedimentation varies from 0 1 to 2 3 with an average value of approximately 1 white 2001 the storage capacity of reservoirs in china is being lost at an annual rate of 2 3 wang and hu 2009 reservoir sedimentation affects the functionality of reservoirs in terms of flood control hydropower generation irrigation and impact on the ecology kondolf et al 2014 paolo et al 2016 balancing these competing objectives has become one of the most complicated problems for the managers and operators worldwide huang et al 2019a 2019b water resources engineers must convert the global inventory of non sustainable reservoirs into sustainable assets for future generations by applying sediment management measures palmieri et al 2003 various approaches have been applied to reduce reservoir sedimentation to maximise the overall reservoir efficiency and prolong the reservoir lifespan including mechanical approaches density current venting free flow sediment flushing and partly drawdown flushing lai and shen 1996 atkinson 1996 mechanical approaches such as dredging and syphoning are mainly used in the excavation of smaller or local reservoirs flushing sediment by density currents is effective for turbidity reservoirs fan and morris 1992 garcia 1994 wang and hu 2009 wang et al 2016 drawdown flushing plays a significant role in storage capacity restoration and conservation because it is an efficient hydraulic technique for sediment removal liu et al 2004 this method mainly involves two approaches namely full drawdown flushing free flow sediment flushing and partial drawdown flushing emamgholizadeh et al 2006 shen 1999 indicated that drawdown flushing was more efficient in narrow reservoirs than in wide reservoirs the effect of flushing sediment varies significantly in different reservoirs castillo et al 2015 generally the technique of drawdown flushing is an effective method to reduce reservoir sedimentation however it involves large volumes of water passing through the dam especially for wide reservoirs one of the key questions for a reservoir owner is whether the benefits of drawdown flushing of the reservoir are commensurate with the anticipated costs as related to the quantity of water lost from the reservoir haun and olsen 2012 thus the operation of water and sediment release affects the reservoir sedimentation and efficient utilisation of water resources the celerity of flood wave propagation in a reservoir was studied theoretically based on st venant equations miller 1984 singh and li 1993 and it was indicated that the flood waves propagated downstream with the celerity of kinematic wave diffusion waves gravity waves and dynamic waves the earliest study of flood and sediment peaks was conducted by einstein 1943 who believed that the separation of the flood and sediment peaks occurred because the sediment moved at the velocity of water while the flood wave moved more quickly resulting in an increase in the time lag of the sediment peak behind the flood peak the sediment peak may precede coincide with or follow the flood peak during a flood event heidel 1956 most field investigations have indicated that the flood wave celerity exceeds sediment wave celerity while the sediment peak arrives after the flood peak downstream of the reservoir gilvear and petts 1985 leeks and newson 1989 brandt and swenning 1999 dong et al 2014a in recent years large cascade reservoirs such as xiangjiaba and xiluodu in jinshajiang upstream of the yangzte river have been operating which reduced the inflow of sediment in the tgr the average annual incoming runoff and sediment load during 2008 2016 to the tgr indicate that the incoming runoff has remained almost unchanged however the incoming sediment load has obviously declined hu et al 2011 the changes in the incoming runoff and sediment environment upstream of the tgr affected the method of water and sediment management and operation in the flood season on the other hand for the tgr to ensure the safety of flood control the water level of the reservoir should be kept at the flood control water level 145 m during the flood season and raised gradually to the normal pool level 175 m after the flood season even though this operation keeps the reservoir well prepared throughout the flood season for a very low probability flood event huge amounts of flood water resources have to be spilled during the flood season thus adversely affecting the comprehensive benefits of the reservoir huang et al 2015 therefore the managers of the tgr dispatched small and medium sized floods and impounded water in advance at the end of the flood season the purpose was to improve the comprehensive benefits of power generation and navigation and the full refill probability under the premise of not lowering the flood control standard and reducing the pressure of downstream flood control of the tgd however in the process of despatching small and medium sized floods and impounding water in advance at the end of the flood season the increase in the water level in the reservoir and a decrease in the flow velocity aggravated the sedimentation in the reservoir to reduce the impact of reservoir sedimentation caused by this regulation of small and medium sized floods the tgr carried out sediment peak regulation tests during the flood seasons of 2012 and 2013 based on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks and improved the efficiency of sediment release dong et al 2014b the so called sediment peak regulation takes advantage of the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks in the flood propagation process and during the rising period of the flood the discharged flow is lowered to reduce the flood peak and when the sediment peak reaches the dam the discharged flow is increased to release high concentration sediment this is one of the effective methods to reduce the tgr sedimentation however field experiments on sediment peak regulation are seldom carried out and there is a lack of in depth understanding of the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream of the tgr hence this aspect needs to be further explored for decades computational fluid dynamics cfd has been utilised as an effective hydraulic engineering tool to investigate flood propagation and the corresponding sediment transport erosion and deposition in riverine or reservoir environments the simplified one dimensional 1d or two dimensional 2d hydrodynamics models that solve shallow water flow equations with sediment transport formula usually incur small computation costs to simulate relatively large domains with a long duration therefore these models have been widely applied to simulate reservoir sediment flushing and predict reservoir sedimentation in hydraulic engineering ahn et al 2013 amini et al 2014 castillo et al 2015 wang et al 2016 xia et al 2018 ahn et al 2013 applied the semi 2d numerical model gstars4 to simulate the sedimentation and flushing processes under hypothetical flow scenarios to investigate the sediment flushing efficiency for lewis and clark lake amini et al 2014 used 2d numerical models to simulate the sedimentation process to optimise the sediment injection procedure and investigate the effect of sediment injection downstream castillo et al 2015 used empirical formulas and a 1d numerical model to estimate sedimentation in a reservoir and a 2d numerical model to analyse the sediment flushing in the reservoir wang et al 2016 used 2d numerical models to investigate open channel flow turbidity current and flow exchanges between a main river and tributaries in xiaolangdi reservoir xia et al 2018 adopted a 1d numerical model to simulate the highly concentrated flood and channel evolution in a braided reach in spite of the simplifications and assumptions employed by these models the depth averaging or section averaging governing equations have been successfully applied to the modelling of reservoir sedimentation problems in some cases in many practical applications the interactions among flow sediment and geomorphic evolution are complicated hydrodynamic phenomena especially in complex natural terrains with floodplains high bend channels large bedforms and submerged islands for such circumstances the 3 d hydrodynamic effects such as a strong secondary flow curvature effect flow separation and strong adverse pressure gradients were significant in sediment erosion transport and sedimentation and affected the prediction accuracy of 1d and 2d numerical models olsen 1999 for instance olsen 1999 adopted a 2d approach to model the sediment flushing processes in reservoirs and found that there were deviations between measured and calculated bed levels in a bend owing to secondary currents jia et al 2014 used a 3d numerical model to study flow structures and suspended sediment transport in the dam area of the three gorges project tgp the results indicated that the maximum concentration of suspended load occurred at the convex side while the minimum was at the concave side owing to the impact of secondary currents munoz and constantinescu 2018 compared the differences between the simulation results obtained by a 3 d model and a depth averaged 2 d model and the results showed that the 2d model yielded significant discrepancies in regions containing highly curved river reaches and hydraulic structures owing to the recent advances in computational algorithms and high performance supercomputers the current day 3d numerical models can simulate complicated hydraulic engineering problems in field scale fluvial streams fang and rodi 2002 2003 lu and wang 2009 dargahi 2010 haun and olsen 2012 haun et al 2013 jia et al 2014 khosronejad et al 2016 munoz and constantinescu 2018 zhang and wu 2020 haun and olsen 2012 used a 3d numerical model with an adaptive non orthogonal and unstructured grid to predict the flushing process of the angostura reservoir in costa rica on a prototype scale and haun et al 2013 modelled the suspended sediment distribution and deposition pattern in the reservoir dargahi 2010 used a 3d numerical model to investigate the flow features and river morphology in a bifurcation river khosronejad et al 2016 used a 3d high fidelity numerical model to investigate the flow and bed evolution in the local reach of the upper mississippi river with several natural islands and man made hydraulic structures during extreme flood conditions munoz and constantinescu 2018 used a 3d non hydrostatic reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model with the volume of fluid vof approach to predict flood wave propagation and assess the efficiency of flood protection measures in complex natural open channels and pressurised flows zhang and wu 2020 used a 3d numerical model to study the influence of low concentration sediment transport in the niulan river on water intake during the flood season in the water diversion project of dianchi lake for studying the tgr fang and rodi 2002 2003 used a 3d numerical model to simulate the flow and suspended sediment transport in a region near the three gorges dam tgd in the yangtze river lu and wang 2009 used a 3d numerical model to simulate sediment erosion and deposition in the vicinity of the tgd and predicted the size distribution of the deposits flow and sediment concentration at different times and elevations jia et al 2014 adopted a 3d numerical model to investigate 3d flow structures and suspended sediment transport in the reservoir dam area as can be seen the aforementioned 3d numerical studies were mainly used to study sediment transport and sedimentation in the region near the tgd s reservoir tgr however the characteristics of flood and sand peak propagation downstream in the flood process have seldom been studied which is critical to implementing sediment peak regulation the main reason is that the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream are related to the scale time and space scales of the river or reservoir it is difficult to study the lag relationship between the flood and sediment peaks at short distances and times the tgr is more than 660 km long with a very complex terrain and the 3d numerical simulation faces a significant difficulty during the process of flood propagation the 3d numerical semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism zhang and baptista 2008 zhang et al 2016 is a seamless cross scale model based on unstructured grids for hydrodynamics and ecosystem dynamics schism is a derivative of the original selfe model zhang and baptista 2008 schism was implemented by zhang et al 2016 and other developers with a semi implicit time step better numerical stability and dry wet boundary algorithm which are suitable for modelling the flood propagation and sediment transport on a large scale to investigate the asynchronous movement characteristics of flood and sediment peaks propagation downstream ahead of the tgd the flood propagation and sediment transport in nearly 280 km long reach were simulated by using the 3d numerical model schism under different reservoir operational scenarios to validate the numerical model the events of flood propagation and sediment transport in june 2013 were reproduced based on the numerical results in different reservoir operational scenarios the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks upstream of the tgr were further analysed this paper is organised as follows section 2 presents the location and data sources of the study area section 3 presents the governing equations of the hydrodynamic sediment transport and bed morphodynamic models section 4 details the setup sensitivity analysis and validation of the numerical model the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks under different reservoir operational scenarios were studied and are presented in section 5 finally the main conclusions of this study are summarised 2 study site and data sources 2 1 site background the yangtze river basin is characterised by a subtropical monsoon climate originating from the southeast pacific ocean and the indian ocean monsoon driven precipitation causes seasonal variability in river flow with high waters and sediment discharge in the flood season from may to october hu et al 2011 the yangtze river is generally divided into three major reaches namely the upper reach middle reach and lower reach the tgp which is the largest hydraulic engineering project in the world is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river upstream of the city of yichang hubei province the tgd located at the outlet of the three gorges was built for flood control navigation and hydropower generation the tgd began operation in june 2003 and the entire tgp was completed in 2009 the normal impounded level of the tgr can reach up to 175 m and the corresponding total storage capacity is 393 108 m3 the flood control water level is 145 m which ensures the safety of both the dam and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in the event of the occurrence of the design flood 1000 years of return period or maximum flood 10 000 years 10 of return period li et al 2014 the corresponding effective storage capacity at 145 m is 221 5 108 m3 ren et al 2020 the annual average runoff at the tgr is 4304 108 m3 1950 2015 accounting for 48 2 of the runoff of the yangtze river the fraction of the input sediment load which is transported downstream of the tgp is estimated to be only 24 1 during the post construction period 2003 2016 with an annual sediment deposition in the tgp of about 1 21 108 t huang et al 2019 the increased frequency of extreme floods with high sediment yield exacerbated the reservoir sedimentation the reservoir managers are tasked with the attempt to explore efficient sediment management strategies to conserve the storage capacity of reservoirs the tgr is approximately 660 km long therefore if the total reservoir is modelled with a 3d model the computation requires massive computational resources the wanxian hydrological station was selected as the inlet boundary of the model and the length from this station to the tgd is approximately 280 km for such a long distance a large scale 3d numerical simulation is a challenging task the miaohe hydrological station is located between wanxian and the tgd which has measurements of flow discharge and sediment concentration that can be used for validation of the numerical model the water level of the reservoir measured at the wanxian hydrological station is a key factor that affects the reservoir sedimentation and it has a significant impact on the sediment peak regulation in the tgr therefore this study is located between the wanxian and maoping hydrological stations which is ahead of the tgd fig 1 2 2 data sources the data used in this study including the bathymetric and historical hydrological data were obtained from the hydrology bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission and the china three gorges corporation the effectiveness of the 3d numerical models depends on the river geometry and surface roughness dargahi 2010 the bathymetric survey for measuring the bed levels in the tgr before the flood season in 2011 was implemented by the hydrology bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission as shown in fig 2 in this study only a few important hydrographic stations have been established between wanxian and the tgd spanning approximately 280 km long these include wanxian fengjie wushan miaohe and maoping stations furthermore not all hydrological data such as water elevation flow discharge q average sectional flow velocity u and suspended sediment concentration ssc are available at these hydrologic stations fig 2 indicates that only one station i e miaohe can predict sediment information from wanxian station to the tgd therefore owing to little sediment information being available in this region flood and sediment regulation could not be effectively conducted based on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks therefore a 3d numerical simulation of flood and sediment transport was studied in the tgr the temporal variations of inflow discharge and sediment concentration measured during the flood period at wanxian were used as the inlet boundary condition in the model fig 3 a the red square in fig 3a represents the flow discharge peak in the flood hydrograph and the red circle in fig 3a represents the sediment peak corresponding to the flow discharge peak the sediment peak lagged behind the corresponding flow discharge for a certain time in this study reach there are several tributaries fig 1 c whose flow discharge is small compared to the inlet flow discharge as shown in table 1 therefore the flow discharge of the tributaries is not considered in the model the temporal variations of water level recorded during the flood period at maoping station were used as the outlet boundary condition in the model fig 3 b the time is from july 1 to august 1 in present simulation and the time interval was 32 days covering the entire process of sediment transport in a flood event in the upper reach of the tgr in the yangtze river the sediment transport was mainly in the form of suspended sediment fang and rodi 2003 jia et al 2014 during the flood period in july 2013 the sediment size distribution of the suspended sediment measured at wanxian station is shown in fig 4 the inflow sediment was mainly suspended sediment and the sediment particle diameter was in the range of 0 002 0 062 mm considering that the sediment size with particle diameters of 0 002 and 0 004 mm was small these two classes of sediment were aggregated with that having 0 003 mm diameter for modelling purposes thus in this study five sediment sizes were considered for the simulation as shown in table 2 in general the coarsest sediment sizes are deposited close to the inflow area while the finer sediments are transported further downstream into the reservoir jia et al 2014 the study region of the tgr covered a total of 72 cross sectional locations where the composition of the bed material was measured before the flood season the setup of bed sediment size was the same as that of the suspended sediments at wanxian the composition of the bed material was obtained from an interpolation based on the locations of the total 72 cross sections as shown in fig 5 3 numerical simulation method a 3d numerical model schism based on unstructured grid model zhang and baptista 2008 zhang et al 2016 is adopted in this study it is an open source community supported modeling system based on mixed triangular quadrangular unstructured grids in the horizontal and a very flexible coordinate system in the vertical zhang et al 2015 the model is solved with finite element and finite volume techniques semi implicit schemes are applied to solve the navier stokes equations to improve stability and maximize the efficiency to treat the advection terms in the momentum equation the model uses a higher order eulerian lagrangian method allowing the use of high time steps without compromising the model precision and the stability the very robust wetting and drying scheme used in schism is suitable to model flood propagation and inundation studies 3 1 flow governing equations in cartesian coordinate system the governing equations based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations are as follows the continuity equation is 1 u x v y w z 0 the momentum equations are 2 du dt f v g η x 1 ρ 0 p a x g ρ 0 z b η ρ x d z z υ u z μ 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 3 dv dt f u g

considering salinity and temperature ρ a is the atmospheric pressure at the free surface g is the acceleration of gravity μ is the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient which is a model specific constant and υ is the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient which is closed with the turbulence closure the density field is determined from an equation of state that accounts for suspended sediment concentrations the water density is calculated as follows 4 ρ ρ f i 1 n c i ρ s i ρ s i ρ f where ρ is the fluid local density including the salinity temperature and sediment effects ρ f is the water density including salinity and temperature effects and n i is the total number of sediment classes the effect of the salinity and temperature on the density field is neglected in the present studies for the turbulence closure the generic length scale gls proposed by umlauf and burchard 2003 is used in the numerical model which has the advantage of encompassing most of the 2 5 equation closure models k ε rodi 1984 k ω wilcox 1998 the two standard equations of the turbulent kinetic energy k and a generic length scale variable ψ are expressed by 5 dk dt z ν k ψ υ m 2 μ n 2 ε 6 d ψ dt z ν ψ ψ

model specific constants the stability functions s m and s h are given by an algebraic stress model galperin et al 1988 kantha and clayson 1994 canuto et al 2001 the specific choices of the constants p m and n lead to the different closure models in this study the k ε model is adopted as the turbulence closure model the related parameters in the model are in table 3 at the free surface and at the bottom the turbulent kinetic energy and the mixing length are specified as direchlet boundary conditions 12 k 1 2 b 1 2 3 τ b 2 13 l κ d b o r κ d s where τ b is a bottom frictional stress κ 0 4 is the von kármán constant b 1 is a constant and d b and d s are the distances to the bottom and the free surface respectively the classic logarithmic distribution of the vertical velocity in the interior boundary layer is defined by a shear velocity and bottom roughness length 14 u u κ ln δ b z 0 where u u 2 v 2 u τ bx τ by ρ z 0 is the bottom roughness length and δ b is the bottom computational layer thickness 3 2 sediment transport equations the suspended sediment transport for sediment in schish derived from the coupling of the transport formulation and the roms sediment transport formulation warner et al 2008 the model has an advantage of being able to calculate an unlimited number of sediment size classes for each sediment class the model solves the horizontal and vertical advection the vertical diffusion the vertical settling velocity and bottom sediment deposition or erosion the suspended sediment transport for each sediment class i is calculated by solving the advection diffusion equation as follows 15 c i t u c i x v c i y w ω f i c i z z ν c i z μ 2 c i x 2 2 c i y 2 d q e q where c i is the sediment concentration for class i u v and w are velocity in three directions respectively and ω f i is the sediment settling velocity for class i e q and d q is the erosion flux and deposition flux respectively the phenomenon of sediment flocculation is widespread in tgr the settling velocity of cohesive sediment depends on the floc size concentration of particles and organic content of the sediment li et al 2018 the flocculation process is dynamic and complex the critical particle size of sediment flocculation in the tgr is about 0 02 mm based the measured data the flocculation factor f is commonly used to quantify the change in the settling velocity of sediment before and after flocculation huang 1981 16 f ω f i ω s i where ω f i is settling velocity with flocculation effect and ω s i is the free settling velocity of a single sediment particle in the clear water calculated by the stokes formulation 17 ω s i ρ s ρ f g d i 2 18 ρ f v the more widely used form of flocculation factor in the three gorges reservoir is 18 f α d β where the parameter α is generally 0 0007 0 0013 0 0055 β is 1 9 and 1 02 huang 1981 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 studied the attenuation law of sediment peak from the wanxian to miaohe station in the reservoir and the coefficient α and β adopted in their study for modified formula of sediment flocculation were 0 0055 and 1 02 respectively therefore the same coefficient is used in this study the sediment exchange between the bed and the flow is calculated based on erosion flux e q and deposition flux d q acting on the bottom computational cell thus the net suspended sediment flux is given by d q e q the deposition flux is defined by 19 d q ω f i c 1 where c 1 are the sediment concentration computed at the bottom computational cell the erosion flux proposed by ariathurai and arulanandan 1978 is written as 20 e i e 0 i 1 q φ i τ b τ cr i i f τ b τ cr i where e i is a bed erodibility constant and determined based on local bed sediment conditions the value is ranging from 10 4 to 10 2 kg m 2 s 1 xu et al 2002 blaas et al 2007 q is the porosity of bed sediment layer φ i is the volumetric fraction of each sediment class q i τ cr i is the critical shear stress for class q i and τ b τ bx 2 τ by 2 is the bed shear stress in present study the density field is determined from an equation of state that accounts for suspended sediment concentrations the water density is calculated as follows 21 ρ ρ w i 1 n c i ρ s i ρ s i ρ f where ρ is the fluid local density including the salinity temperature and sediment effects ρ f is the water density including salinity and temperature effects and n is the total number of sediment classes the effect of the salinity and temperature on the density field is neglected in the present study 3 3 bed evolution module the sediment bed changes due to the local erosion and deposition under the bed shear stress the total depth variation δ h is calculated in the prism center and is given by the sum of the depth variations of each sediment class due to suspended sediment transport the net sediment bed changes due to suspended sediment transport are calculated for each sediment class q i as 22 δ h d q e q δ t ρ s 1 p the change from the prism centers to the nodes is made as follows 23 δ h sn e 1 nel a e δ h e 1 nel a e where δ h se is the element depth variation due to the suspended transport and nel is the number of elements that contain the node n the sediment bed is assumed as a user specified constant number of sediment layers and total sediment thickness beneath the water column each layer in sediment bed is initialized with a given thickness sediment class distribution porosity the bed layers are modified at each time step to account for erosion deposition and track stratigraphy more details can be found in paper of warner et al 2008 4 setup and validation of numerical model the schish model has been applied in open channels to investigate the sediment deposition process sediment concentration profiles and morphological evolution pinto et al 2012 the model s accuracy stability and robustness were verified by zhang et al 2020 to study the physical processes in compound flooding events in delaware bay the schism model requires no bathymetry smoothing and avoids the detrimental effects of smoothing on the physics of the process ye et al 2020 to adapt to the sharp slope and variable water level in the vertical dimension and the stratification effect of sediment concentration a new vertical coordinate system named localised sigma coordinates with shaved cell lsc2 proposed by zhang et al 2015 was adopted in this study which was demonstrated to have the benefits of both terrain following and z coordinate system the following section described the setup parameter sensitivity analysis and validation of the numerical model through its comparison with the measured results in the process of flood propagation in july 2013 in the tgr 4 1 setup and parameter sensitivity analysis of numerical model for such a large scale numerical simulation the grid setup is very crucial for the numerical model to not only ensure the accuracy of the results but also save some computational resources using very fine meshes is not a preferred option for a large computational domain as huge computational costs are incurred to simulate flood propagation in a 3 d numerical model munoz and constantinescu 2018 fang and rodi 2003 used a curvilinear non orthogonal grid to simulate the flow field and suspended sediment transport in the neighbourhood of the tgd the smallest spacings between the adjacent grid nodes in the stream wise lateral and vertical directions were 70 25 50 and 5 6 m respectively a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of grid size and manning roughness coefficient on the accuracy of the model results and the efficiency of the calculation in this study the flow discharge basically remained constant the effect of the grid setup on the modelled results was evaluated with a change in water level at wanxian and fengjie hydrological stations these two are located at the inlet and middle reaches in the tgr fig 2 and a comparison between the measured and modelled water levels reflected the sensitivity of the grid setup on the results the sensitivity analysis cases were modelled using 196 cores on the explore 100 cluster system of the tsinghua national laboratory for information science and technology the horizontal grid was set as triangular meshes with sizes of 28 25 and 22 m respectively and the details of the model setup are listed in table 4 the effect of the size of the horizontal grid on the water level is presented in fig 6 in which fig 6 a b presents the temporal variations of water level at the wanxian and fengjie hydrological stations fig 6 c presents the change in the water level along the thalweg from wanxian to the tgd this indicates that the simulated water level gradually decreased as the horizontal grid size decreased furthermore the computation time increased as the horizontal grid decreased when the mesh size was set to 22 m the modelled results were in good agreement with the measured results the variation in the water level indicates that the horizontal grid had a large influence on the modelled results to analyse the effect of the vertical grid size on the modelled results the vertical grid was set to sizes of 10 7 and 5 m respectively and the details of the model setup are presented in table 5 the effect of the vertical grid on the water level is presented in fig 7 fig 7 a b presents the temporal variation of water level at wanxian and fengjie fig 7 c presents the change in the water level along the thalweg from wanxian to the tgd this indicates that the water level gradually decreased as the mean vertical grid count increased furthermore the computation time increased as the mean vertical grid count increased the variation in the water level indicates that the vertical grid had a relatively small influence on the modelled results the manning roughness coefficient is also an important parameter for the simulation three model cases were conducted to analyse the effect of the manning coefficient on the propagation of flood and sediment peaks castillo et al 2015 indicated that the manning roughness coefficients for the floodplain and main channel were different considering the storage level of the tgr the gravel bed load gradually got deposited in the fluctuating backwater zone while the finer suspended sediment reached the dam fang and rodi 2003 jia et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 therefore the manning roughness coefficient for the main channel and floodplain was set to different values in this study manning roughness coefficients n1 and n2 were used under a water level of 130 m and above a water level of 130 m respectively fig 8 presents the effect of the manning roughness coefficient on the propagation of the simulated flood and sediment peaks fig 8 a indicates that the manning roughness coefficient had an insignificant influence on the flood peak castillo et al 2015 pointed out that this coefficient decreased as the flow discharge increased the manning coefficient was not sensitive to the flood peak propagation with a large flow discharge the influence of the manning coefficient on sediment concentration was mainly reflected in the speed of the sediment peak propagation it can be seen from fig 8 b that the smaller the manning coefficient the faster the sediment peak propagation the increase in the manning coefficient resulted in a decrease in the average flow velocity accordingly the decrease in the average flow velocity led to a decrease in the sediment carrying capacity therefore the sediment peak decayed more easily 4 2 validation of the numerical model to adapt to complex terrain and reduce computation resources a numerical model was built based on a mixed triangular quadrangular horizontal grid a quadrangular grid was used in the wide main channel with a 23 24 m grid size and an irregular triangular grid was used in the floodplain and the narrow canyon with a 21 23 m grid size the total number of nodes and elements in the computational frame were 495 662 and 856056 respectively along the horizontal dimension the elevation of each node was interpolated from the measured topography in 2011 and the elevation of the local topography is shown in fig 9 a b the spacing of the vertical grid was set to 5 m and the vertical grid of a local cross section is shown in fig 9 c to accommodate these grid sizes the time step in this simulation was set to 30 s the simulated case required approximately 8 days to model with 280 cores on the explore 100 cluster system of the tsinghua national laboratory for information science and technology in the entire tgr spanning approximately 660 km the hydrological stations with flow discharge average flow velocity sediment concentration and water level included zhutuo cuntan qingxichang wanxian and miaohe stations fig 1 b in this study in the reach between wanxian hydrologic station to the tgd the fengjie wushan miaohe maoping hydrological stations are located however only the miaohe hydrological station records the flow discharge average flow velocity sediment concentration and water level while the other hydrological stations contain only the water level information fig 1 c the flow discharge flow velocity and sediment concentration at important hydrological stations are not measured every day because of the constraints of the harsh environment during the flooding days the available daily measured data were interpolated based on the measurement data using an empirical regression model or formulae zhou et al 2016 for the important hydrological stations in the tgr such as zhutuo cuntan qingxichang wanxian and miaohe the detailed vertical velocity and sediment concentration at a stations were recorded only twice during the annual flood season owing to the measurement environment limitations the measurement method adopted a five point method to verify the accuracy of the numerical model a comparison of the modelled results and the measured water levels at fengjie wushan and miaohe stations as well as the flow discharge cross sectional average flow velocity and sediment concentration at miaohe station were analyzed fig 10 presents the comparisons of water level between the modelled and measured results at three hydrological stations this shows that the modelled results were in good agreement with the measured results some local differences may have been caused by the accuracy issues with the grid and the local manning roughness the bed roughness was difficult to measure accurately over such a long reach this indicates that the numerical model had the ability to simulate large changes in water levels fig 11 presents comparisons of the flow discharges and average flow velocities between the modelled and measured results at miaohe station it shows that the modelled results are generally consistent with the measured results the local difference may have resulted from the inflow of tributaries through an analysis of the amount of tributary runoff it was found that the flow discharge of tributaries accounts for 1 of the runoff of wanxian station fig 12 presents the comparisons of sediment concentration between the modelled and measured results at miaohe station it shows that the model results are basically consistent with the measured sediment concentration points however there are some errors in the average daily sediment concentration because it is based on an interpolation of measured values using a sediment concentration regression model zhou et al 2016 with an estimated maximum sediment peak error of 14 the minor difference between the model results and measured data may have resulted from the local erosion and deposition in such a complicated terrain to further verify the accuracy of the numerical model the modelled vertical velocity and sediment concentration were compared with the measured data for the important hydrological stations in three gorges reservoir such as zhutuo cuntan qingxichang wanxian and miaohe stations the detailed vertical velocity and sediment concentration at each station were recorded twice during the annual flood season due to measurement environment limitations the measurement was conducted using the five point method comparisons of the vertical velocity and sediment concentration between the modelled and measured data are shown in fig 13 the locations of the gauging points at the miaohe station together with the instantaneous distributions of the modelled velocity and sediment concentration are shown in fig 14 the comparison of the flow velocity between the modelled and measured results indicates that the model flow velocity is consistent with the measured results except for some deviation at the bottom of the flow for the comparison of suspended sediment concentration overall the modelled results are basically consistent with the measured results however there were some differences between the two gauging points points a and b some model tests were conducted by adjusting the sediment settling velocity and proportion of different particle size classes for this errors a possible reason for the difference is that the bed load sediment movement is not considered in the model which leads to a low sediment concentration at the bottom of gauging points a and b other reasons may be terrain and measurement errors the instantaneous vertical distributions of the modelled velocity and suspended sediment concentration in fig 14 indicate that the suspended sediment concentration is not uniformly distributed on the cross section and presents the stratification effect jia et al 2014 indicated that the maximum concentration of the suspended load occurred at the convex side while the minimum was at the concave side owing to the impact of the secondary currents in the bend river 5 results and analysis water storage of the tgp was divided into three stages according to the storage level namely 135 145 m and 175 m fig 15 the first impoundment was in 2003 and it operated at 135 m in the flood season the reservoir was refilled with water in 2006 and it operated at 145 m in the flood season and at 155 m in the dry season at the end of the flood season in 2008 175 m of experimental water storage was carried out the tgp was completed in 2009 after 2010 the normal water level was 175 m the limit water level of flood control was 145 m at the beginning of the flood season and the control water level was 155 m in the low flow season to satisfy the requirements of power generation the main hydrographic stations with the information of flow discharge and sediment concentration in the upstream of tgr were zhutuo cuntan qingxichang wanxian and miaohe as shown in fig 1b and fig 15 the backwater zone of the tgr about 600 km long extended to the chongqing section zhutuo station the water storage zone in the tgr was divided into a perennial backwater zone and a variable backwater zone according to the operational water level in front of the dam ren et al 2020 the river reach between zhutuo and cuntan was in the natural river state and was not influenced by the impounded water of the tgr the river reach between cuntan and qingxichang was in the fluctuating backwater zone at the tail of the tgr the river reach between qiangxichang and the tgd was in the perennial backwater zone in the tgr wanxian is located in the middle of the tgr and the riverbed elevation is less than 145 m in the flood season the tgr operates at a lower level 145 m and in the dry season it operated at a higher level 155 m therefore the reach between wanxian and tgd is affected by the storage water level of the tgr throughout its operating time after the impounded water of the tgr the large rise in the water level and the change in the water and sediment environment in the upper reaches of the tgr both affect the propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks in the reservoir which in turn affect the operation and sedimentation of the tgr ren et al 2020 5 1 propagation process of flood and sediment peaks the 3d numerical model has the advantage of being able to more precisely calculate the flow velocity and sediment concentration than the 2d model of an average cross section to analyse the propagation process of flood propagation and sediment transport in the tgr the flood event in july 2013 were simulated fig 16 shows the instantaneous modelled results of the 3d flow field in parts of the tgr this indicates that the flow velocity is unevenly distributed owing to the effects of the topographical structure and channel pattern overall the flow velocity in the upstream reservoir is greater than that in front of the dam except for some canyons because of the increase in water depth fig 17 a c shows the instantaneous contours of the modelled suspended sediment concentration at the arriving stage propagating process and passing away of sediment peak along the thalweg in the entire study reach respectively the sediment concentration distribution indicates that it was evidently different at different stages of sediment peak propagation before the onset of the sediment peak and after its passing away the sediment concentration distribution followed the general rouse distribution in that the sediment concentration at the upper part of the flow was small while at the lower part it was large fig 17 a c however in the process of forward propagation of the sediment peak the sediment concentration distribution indicates that at the upper part of the flow it was larger and at the lower part it was smaller fig 17b this indicates that the distribution of high sediment concentration in the strong unsteady flow was different from that in the constant or weak unsteady flow this was related to the distribution of flow velocity during the process of flood propagation the higher flow velocity with high concentration sediment propagated faster which led to a higher sediment concentration in the upper part than in the lower part from the turbulent kinetic energy of the flow it appears that the high concentration sediment had an inhibitory effect on water turbulence this is consistent with the flume experiment wang and qian 1989 asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks there are various flood wave types according to the simplification of the shallow water wave theory including kinematic diffusion gravity and dynamic waves and these waves have different celerities miller 1984 singh and li 1993 a flood wave propagation diagram of river course reservoir is shown in fig 18 a flood wave has the characteristics of both kinematic and dynamic waves referring to fig 18 h 0 is the water depth of the base flow h and h m are the wave height at a certain section and the maximum height respectively λ is the half wavelength and i is the bed slope when h h 0 the kinematic wave is dominant and thus the flood wave is a kinematic wave the kinematic wave is transported at a celerity 24 c k u k 1 2 when h h 0 the dynamic wave is dominant and thus the flood wave is a dynamic wave the celerity of the dynamic wave is 25 c u g h 0 where u is the average flow velocity during the propagation of flood waves in rivers based on the relative heights of the wave amplitude and water depth eqs 24 25 when the flood wave propagates in the river course reservoir it gradually changes from a kinematic wave to a dynamic one the natural flow regimes of the yangzte river have been altered by the construction of the tgd from cuntan station to the tgd the water depth gradually increased fig 15 therefore the propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment transport upstream of the tgr were also altered to further analyse the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks downstream in the upstream reaches of the tgr during the flood season in this study three simulation cases based on different operating scenarios were set up the distinction among these three operating scenarios was the difference in the water level ahead of the tgd as shown in fig 19 the temporal variations of flow discharge and sediment concentration at five hydrological stations fig 2 were obtained based on the modelled results to investigate the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream in the tgr fig 20 presents a comparison of the temporal variations of modelled flow discharge and sediment concentration at the hydrological stations under different operating scenarios it shows that for the same hydrological stations as the impounded level increased the earlier the flood peak arrived the faster the flood wave propagated the sediment peak arrived later as the impounded level increased the sediment peak travelled slower because the increase in the water level led to a decrease in the average flow velocity the change in the impounded level had an insignificant effect on the occurrence time and magnitude of the flood peak but a significant effect on the occurrence time and magnitude of the sediment peak for the same operating water level for example in case 2 the temporal variations of the modelled flow discharge and sediment concentration at different hydrological stations are presented in fig 21 this shows that as the flood propagated downstream the value of the flood peak decreased gradually owing to the discharged flow small fluctuations in the flood peak curve appeared at the downstream this was because of the reflection and mutual interference of waves of the water body with different frequencies held by the tgd and the load shedding of the hydraulic turbines li and singh 1993 the sediment concentration decreased gradually as the flood propagated downstream at different hydrological stations the reason was that as the flood propagated downstream the increase in the water depth resulted in a decrease in the sediment carrying capacity of the flow which resulted in an increase in the sediment deposition accordingly the sediment peak gradually decayed owing to sediment settlement zhang et al 2018 studied the attenuation of the sediment peak upstream of the tgr and pointed out that the attenuation of the sediment peak was related to the length flow discharge and suspended sediment particle gradation to quantitatively analyse the effect of the impounded level of the tgr on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream the modelled results of the arrival time and lag time of flood and sediment peaks at the hydrological stations under different operating scenarios are shown in table 6 it is indicated that the change in the impounded level of the tgr had less effect on the arrival time of the flood peak propagation but had a large impact on the arrival time of the sediment peak from the time of the sediment peak lagging behind the flood peak it appears that the lag time increased as the impounded level of the tgr increased in addition the lag time increased as the flood propagated downstream under the same operational water level the measured hydrological data from the bureau of hydrology changjiang water resources commission indicated that in the case of a major flood the flow discharge peak took 18 30 h to propagate from the cuntan hydrological station to the tgd while it took 3 7 days for the sediment peak zheng 2016 for the same traversal dong et al 2014b analysed the sediment transport data from the tgr during the flood season in 2012 and the propagation time of the sediment peaks varied from 3 to 7 days this indicates that the time of sediment peak lagging behind the flood peak could be adjusted by regulating the impounded level ahead of the tgd the sediment peak regulation takes advantage of the lag between the sediment and flood peaks to release the flood water with high sediment concentration by timely opening of the flood discharge gate and storing of water with a lower sediment concentration in a timely manner by closing the flood discharge gate analysis of the lagging time of sediment peak behind the flood peak the tgr began filling water in 2002 and the entire project was completed in 2009 the water level ranges from 130 to 175 m in this study the water depth was much greater than the wave amplitude and the flood wave propagated as a dynamic wave the travel time of the flood peak is 26 t fp l c l u g h 0 in the tgr the water depth is much larger and the average flow velocity is very small thus the travel time of the flood peak is approximately equal to l g h 0 in the perennial backwater area of the tgr the propagation time of the flood peak is mainly determined by the reservoir water level generally speaking the sediment absorbed energy from the flow and is transported along with it the velocity of the sediment transport is basically equal to the average flow velocity then the travel time of the sediment peak huang et al 2019a 2019b is 27 t sp l u al au v q where q is the average flow discharge a is the channel sectional area and v is the flow volume in the river the travel time of the sediment peak is mainly determined by the flow discharge and the reservoir storage for a reservoir the capacity depends on the water level fig 22 presents the relationship between the water level and reservoir storage in the tgr the empirical relationship between the reservoir capacity and water level obtained through curve fitting in the tgr is as follows 28 v 10 8 7 976 e 0 02299 l w 5 3322 where l w is the water level ahead of the dam combined with eqs 26 28 the empirical formula for the lag time of the sediment peak behind the flood peak is 29 δ t 10 8 7 976 e 0 02299 l w 5 3322 q l g h 0 therefore the time of the sediment peak lagging the flood peak mainly depends on the inflow discharge and reservoir water level this lag time is directly proportional to the storage water level and inversely proportional to the flow discharge in the study the simulated reach is from wanxian hydrological station to the tgd which is a part of the tgr fig 15 the modelled case 2 is the actual operation conditions of tgr from the temporal variations in inflow flow discharge and sediment concentration at wanxian station fig 3 a the lag time of sediment peak behind flood peak is 2 days so the modelled results of sediment peak lagging behind flood peak is the total lag time including the lag time between cuntan wanxian and wanxian tgd in actual operating conditions the lag time between wanxian station and the tgd is 6 33 days however the modelled case 1 and 3 are assumed operating scenarios and the lag time between cuntan wanxian and wanxian tgd can only be estimated the estimated lag time is shown in table 7 the comparison of the lag time between the modelled results and the calculated results in the whole tgr is presented in fig 23 it is indicated that there is some error between the modeled and calculated results based on the eq 29 upstream of the tgr the asynchronous propagation phenomenon of the flood and sediment peaks is a complex multi factor driven process huang et al 2019a 2019b the main factors included the uneven distribution of time and space of rainfall different mechanisms of the runoff and sediment yield runoff inflow of tributaries flood and sediment transport mechanisms attenuation of sediment concentration storage water level and reservoir operation regulation they affect the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks to accurately forecast the arrival time of the flood and sediment peaks reaching the dam during the rising period of the flood the discharged flow is lowered to reduce the flood peak when the sediment peak reaches the dam the discharged flow is increased to release the high concentration sediment during the recession period of the flood and to reduce the sedimentation in the reservoir the multi drivers of propagation phenomenon of flood peak and sediment peak will be further studied in future studies 6 conclusions in this study the 3d numerical model schish was adopted to simulate the processes of flood propagation and sediment transport during the flood season in the tgr on a large scale the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks downstream were preliminarily analysed based on the model results under different impounded levels the main conclusions are summarised as follows 1 the 3d numerical model could simulate flood propagation and sediment transport processes accurately on a large scale the error between the model results and measured values may have resulted from the local grid size bed roughness and inflow of the tributaries the sensitivity analysis showed that the horizontal grid had a greater influence on the model results than the vertical grid the manning coefficient was not sensitive to flood peak propagation with large flow discharge but and had a certain influence on the sediment peak propagation process the larger the manning coefficient the slower the sediment peak propagation the sediment peak decayed more easily 2 the flood propagation is a strong unsteady hydrodynamic process the distribution of high sediment concentration in the strong unsteady flow was different from that in the constant or weak unsteady flow in the process of forward propagation of the sediment peak the sediment concentration distribution indicates that at the upper part of the flow it was larger and at the lower part it was smaller and was different than the general rouse distribution this was related to the distribution of flow velocity and the higher flow velocity with high concentration sediment propagated faster which led to a higher sediment concentration in the upper part than in the lower part 3 in the channel type reservoir the propagation mechanism of water flow is changed due to the increase of water depth the velocity difference of flood wave propagation and sediment transport leaded to the asynchronous propagation phenomenon between flood peak and sand peak the impounded level in the tgr had less effect on the propagation time and magnitude of the flood peak but had a significant influence on the propagation time and magnitude of the sediment peak as the water depth increases the time of sand peak lagging behind the flood peak gradually increases based on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks in the flood propagation process the discharged flow is lowered to reduce the flood peak during the rising period of the flood and when the sediment peak reaches the dam the discharged flow is increased to release high concentration sediment this is one of the effective methods to reduce the tgr sedimentation the research results could provide a scientific basis for further optimising the sediment peak regulation and the 3d numerical model could provide a reliable real time tool to predict the arrival time of the flood and sediment peaks in the tgr funding this work was financed by the

4962,the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream i e sediment peak lagging behind flood peak are crucial for the operation of sediment peak release to reduce the sedimentation of the three gorges reservoir tgr in the flood season of 2013 the sediment peak regulation was conducted in the tgr based on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks and promising results were achieved towards reducing the reservoir sedimentation in this study the processes of flood propagation and sediment transport over a stretch of 280 km upstream of the tgr on the yangtze river were studied through a three dimensional 3d semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism focussing on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream it was demonstrated that firstly the model efficiently and accurately reproduced the processes of flood propagation and sediment transport during the 2013 flood season compared with the measured results the sensitivity analysis showed that the horizontal grid used in the numerical modelling had a greater influence on the model results than the vertical grid the manning coefficient was not sensitive to flood peaks propagation with a large flow discharge next the validated model was adopted to investigate the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks under different tgr operational scenarios the results indicated that the impounded level ahead of the three gorges dam tgd had an insignificant influence on the occurrence time and magnitude of the flood peak but had a significant influence on the occurrence time and magnitude of the sediment peak the time of sediment peak lagging behind flood peak increases as the impounded level in the tgr increased the peak value of sediment concentration gradually decreased owing to the sediment deposition the research results could provide a scientific basis for further optimising the sediment peak regulation and the 3d numerical model could provide a reliable real time tool to predict the arrival time of the flood and sediment peaks in the tgr keywords three gorges reservoir flood peak sediment peak sediment concentration reservoir sedimentation 1 introduction construction of dams changes the propagation characteristics of water and sediment transport through rivers as the impounded level ahead of the dams rises up and the flow velocity reduces resulting in reservoir sedimentation global annual reservoir storage loss owing to sedimentation varies from 0 1 to 2 3 with an average value of approximately 1 white 2001 the storage capacity of reservoirs in china is being lost at an annual rate of 2 3 wang and hu 2009 reservoir sedimentation affects the functionality of reservoirs in terms of flood control hydropower generation irrigation and impact on the ecology kondolf et al 2014 paolo et al 2016 balancing these competing objectives has become one of the most complicated problems for the managers and operators worldwide huang et al 2019a 2019b water resources engineers must convert the global inventory of non sustainable reservoirs into sustainable assets for future generations by applying sediment management measures palmieri et al 2003 various approaches have been applied to reduce reservoir sedimentation to maximise the overall reservoir efficiency and prolong the reservoir lifespan including mechanical approaches density current venting free flow sediment flushing and partly drawdown flushing lai and shen 1996 atkinson 1996 mechanical approaches such as dredging and syphoning are mainly used in the excavation of smaller or local reservoirs flushing sediment by density currents is effective for turbidity reservoirs fan and morris 1992 garcia 1994 wang and hu 2009 wang et al 2016 drawdown flushing plays a significant role in storage capacity restoration and conservation because it is an efficient hydraulic technique for sediment removal liu et al 2004 this method mainly involves two approaches namely full drawdown flushing free flow sediment flushing and partial drawdown flushing emamgholizadeh et al 2006 shen 1999 indicated that drawdown flushing was more efficient in narrow reservoirs than in wide reservoirs the effect of flushing sediment varies significantly in different reservoirs castillo et al 2015 generally the technique of drawdown flushing is an effective method to reduce reservoir sedimentation however it involves large volumes of water passing through the dam especially for wide reservoirs one of the key questions for a reservoir owner is whether the benefits of drawdown flushing of the reservoir are commensurate with the anticipated costs as related to the quantity of water lost from the reservoir haun and olsen 2012 thus the operation of water and sediment release affects the reservoir sedimentation and efficient utilisation of water resources the celerity of flood wave propagation in a reservoir was studied theoretically based on st venant equations miller 1984 singh and li 1993 and it was indicated that the flood waves propagated downstream with the celerity of kinematic wave diffusion waves gravity waves and dynamic waves the earliest study of flood and sediment peaks was conducted by einstein 1943 who believed that the separation of the flood and sediment peaks occurred because the sediment moved at the velocity of water while the flood wave moved more quickly resulting in an increase in the time lag of the sediment peak behind the flood peak the sediment peak may precede coincide with or follow the flood peak during a flood event heidel 1956 most field investigations have indicated that the flood wave celerity exceeds sediment wave celerity while the sediment peak arrives after the flood peak downstream of the reservoir gilvear and petts 1985 leeks and newson 1989 brandt and swenning 1999 dong et al 2014a in recent years large cascade reservoirs such as xiangjiaba and xiluodu in jinshajiang upstream of the yangzte river have been operating which reduced the inflow of sediment in the tgr the average annual incoming runoff and sediment load during 2008 2016 to the tgr indicate that the incoming runoff has remained almost unchanged however the incoming sediment load has obviously declined hu et al 2011 the changes in the incoming runoff and sediment environment upstream of the tgr affected the method of water and sediment management and operation in the flood season on the other hand for the tgr to ensure the safety of flood control the water level of the reservoir should be kept at the flood control water level 145 m during the flood season and raised gradually to the normal pool level 175 m after the flood season even though this operation keeps the reservoir well prepared throughout the flood season for a very low probability flood event huge amounts of flood water resources have to be spilled during the flood season thus adversely affecting the comprehensive benefits of the reservoir huang et al 2015 therefore the managers of the tgr dispatched small and medium sized floods and impounded water in advance at the end of the flood season the purpose was to improve the comprehensive benefits of power generation and navigation and the full refill probability under the premise of not lowering the flood control standard and reducing the pressure of downstream flood control of the tgd however in the process of despatching small and medium sized floods and impounding water in advance at the end of the flood season the increase in the water level in the reservoir and a decrease in the flow velocity aggravated the sedimentation in the reservoir to reduce the impact of reservoir sedimentation caused by this regulation of small and medium sized floods the tgr carried out sediment peak regulation tests during the flood seasons of 2012 and 2013 based on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks and improved the efficiency of sediment release dong et al 2014b the so called sediment peak regulation takes advantage of the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks in the flood propagation process and during the rising period of the flood the discharged flow is lowered to reduce the flood peak and when the sediment peak reaches the dam the discharged flow is increased to release high concentration sediment this is one of the effective methods to reduce the tgr sedimentation however field experiments on sediment peak regulation are seldom carried out and there is a lack of in depth understanding of the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream of the tgr hence this aspect needs to be further explored for decades computational fluid dynamics cfd has been utilised as an effective hydraulic engineering tool to investigate flood propagation and the corresponding sediment transport erosion and deposition in riverine or reservoir environments the simplified one dimensional 1d or two dimensional 2d hydrodynamics models that solve shallow water flow equations with sediment transport formula usually incur small computation costs to simulate relatively large domains with a long duration therefore these models have been widely applied to simulate reservoir sediment flushing and predict reservoir sedimentation in hydraulic engineering ahn et al 2013 amini et al 2014 castillo et al 2015 wang et al 2016 xia et al 2018 ahn et al 2013 applied the semi 2d numerical model gstars4 to simulate the sedimentation and flushing processes under hypothetical flow scenarios to investigate the sediment flushing efficiency for lewis and clark lake amini et al 2014 used 2d numerical models to simulate the sedimentation process to optimise the sediment injection procedure and investigate the effect of sediment injection downstream castillo et al 2015 used empirical formulas and a 1d numerical model to estimate sedimentation in a reservoir and a 2d numerical model to analyse the sediment flushing in the reservoir wang et al 2016 used 2d numerical models to investigate open channel flow turbidity current and flow exchanges between a main river and tributaries in xiaolangdi reservoir xia et al 2018 adopted a 1d numerical model to simulate the highly concentrated flood and channel evolution in a braided reach in spite of the simplifications and assumptions employed by these models the depth averaging or section averaging governing equations have been successfully applied to the modelling of reservoir sedimentation problems in some cases in many practical applications the interactions among flow sediment and geomorphic evolution are complicated hydrodynamic phenomena especially in complex natural terrains with floodplains high bend channels large bedforms and submerged islands for such circumstances the 3 d hydrodynamic effects such as a strong secondary flow curvature effect flow separation and strong adverse pressure gradients were significant in sediment erosion transport and sedimentation and affected the prediction accuracy of 1d and 2d numerical models olsen 1999 for instance olsen 1999 adopted a 2d approach to model the sediment flushing processes in reservoirs and found that there were deviations between measured and calculated bed levels in a bend owing to secondary currents jia et al 2014 used a 3d numerical model to study flow structures and suspended sediment transport in the dam area of the three gorges project tgp the results indicated that the maximum concentration of suspended load occurred at the convex side while the minimum was at the concave side owing to the impact of secondary currents munoz and constantinescu 2018 compared the differences between the simulation results obtained by a 3 d model and a depth averaged 2 d model and the results showed that the 2d model yielded significant discrepancies in regions containing highly curved river reaches and hydraulic structures owing to the recent advances in computational algorithms and high performance supercomputers the current day 3d numerical models can simulate complicated hydraulic engineering problems in field scale fluvial streams fang and rodi 2002 2003 lu and wang 2009 dargahi 2010 haun and olsen 2012 haun et al 2013 jia et al 2014 khosronejad et al 2016 munoz and constantinescu 2018 zhang and wu 2020 haun and olsen 2012 used a 3d numerical model with an adaptive non orthogonal and unstructured grid to predict the flushing process of the angostura reservoir in costa rica on a prototype scale and haun et al 2013 modelled the suspended sediment distribution and deposition pattern in the reservoir dargahi 2010 used a 3d numerical model to investigate the flow features and river morphology in a bifurcation river khosronejad et al 2016 used a 3d high fidelity numerical model to investigate the flow and bed evolution in the local reach of the upper mississippi river with several natural islands and man made hydraulic structures during extreme flood conditions munoz and constantinescu 2018 used a 3d non hydrostatic reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model with the volume of fluid vof approach to predict flood wave propagation and assess the efficiency of flood protection measures in complex natural open channels and pressurised flows zhang and wu 2020 used a 3d numerical model to study the influence of low concentration sediment transport in the niulan river on water intake during the flood season in the water diversion project of dianchi lake for studying the tgr fang and rodi 2002 2003 used a 3d numerical model to simulate the flow and suspended sediment transport in a region near the three gorges dam tgd in the yangtze river lu and wang 2009 used a 3d numerical model to simulate sediment erosion and deposition in the vicinity of the tgd and predicted the size distribution of the deposits flow and sediment concentration at different times and elevations jia et al 2014 adopted a 3d numerical model to investigate 3d flow structures and suspended sediment transport in the reservoir dam area as can be seen the aforementioned 3d numerical studies were mainly used to study sediment transport and sedimentation in the region near the tgd s reservoir tgr however the characteristics of flood and sand peak propagation downstream in the flood process have seldom been studied which is critical to implementing sediment peak regulation the main reason is that the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream are related to the scale time and space scales of the river or reservoir it is difficult to study the lag relationship between the flood and sediment peaks at short distances and times the tgr is more than 660 km long with a very complex terrain and the 3d numerical simulation faces a significant difficulty during the process of flood propagation the 3d numerical semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism zhang and baptista 2008 zhang et al 2016 is a seamless cross scale model based on unstructured grids for hydrodynamics and ecosystem dynamics schism is a derivative of the original selfe model zhang and baptista 2008 schism was implemented by zhang et al 2016 and other developers with a semi implicit time step better numerical stability and dry wet boundary algorithm which are suitable for modelling the flood propagation and sediment transport on a large scale to investigate the asynchronous movement characteristics of flood and sediment peaks propagation downstream ahead of the tgd the flood propagation and sediment transport in nearly 280 km long reach were simulated by using the 3d numerical model schism under different reservoir operational scenarios to validate the numerical model the events of flood propagation and sediment transport in june 2013 were reproduced based on the numerical results in different reservoir operational scenarios the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks upstream of the tgr were further analysed this paper is organised as follows section 2 presents the location and data sources of the study area section 3 presents the governing equations of the hydrodynamic sediment transport and bed morphodynamic models section 4 details the setup sensitivity analysis and validation of the numerical model the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks under different reservoir operational scenarios were studied and are presented in section 5 finally the main conclusions of this study are summarised 2 study site and data sources 2 1 site background the yangtze river basin is characterised by a subtropical monsoon climate originating from the southeast pacific ocean and the indian ocean monsoon driven precipitation causes seasonal variability in river flow with high waters and sediment discharge in the flood season from may to october hu et al 2011 the yangtze river is generally divided into three major reaches namely the upper reach middle reach and lower reach the tgp which is the largest hydraulic engineering project in the world is located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river upstream of the city of yichang hubei province the tgd located at the outlet of the three gorges was built for flood control navigation and hydropower generation the tgd began operation in june 2003 and the entire tgp was completed in 2009 the normal impounded level of the tgr can reach up to 175 m and the corresponding total storage capacity is 393 108 m3 the flood control water level is 145 m which ensures the safety of both the dam and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in the event of the occurrence of the design flood 1000 years of return period or maximum flood 10 000 years 10 of return period li et al 2014 the corresponding effective storage capacity at 145 m is 221 5 108 m3 ren et al 2020 the annual average runoff at the tgr is 4304 108 m3 1950 2015 accounting for 48 2 of the runoff of the yangtze river the fraction of the input sediment load which is transported downstream of the tgp is estimated to be only 24 1 during the post construction period 2003 2016 with an annual sediment deposition in the tgp of about 1 21 108 t huang et al 2019 the increased frequency of extreme floods with high sediment yield exacerbated the reservoir sedimentation the reservoir managers are tasked with the attempt to explore efficient sediment management strategies to conserve the storage capacity of reservoirs the tgr is approximately 660 km long therefore if the total reservoir is modelled with a 3d model the computation requires massive computational resources the wanxian hydrological station was selected as the inlet boundary of the model and the length from this station to the tgd is approximately 280 km for such a long distance a large scale 3d numerical simulation is a challenging task the miaohe hydrological station is located between wanxian and the tgd which has measurements of flow discharge and sediment concentration that can be used for validation of the numerical model the water level of the reservoir measured at the wanxian hydrological station is a key factor that affects the reservoir sedimentation and it has a significant impact on the sediment peak regulation in the tgr therefore this study is located between the wanxian and maoping hydrological stations which is ahead of the tgd fig 1 2 2 data sources the data used in this study including the bathymetric and historical hydrological data were obtained from the hydrology bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission and the china three gorges corporation the effectiveness of the 3d numerical models depends on the river geometry and surface roughness dargahi 2010 the bathymetric survey for measuring the bed levels in the tgr before the flood season in 2011 was implemented by the hydrology bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission as shown in fig 2 in this study only a few important hydrographic stations have been established between wanxian and the tgd spanning approximately 280 km long these include wanxian fengjie wushan miaohe and maoping stations furthermore not all hydrological data such as water elevation flow discharge q average sectional flow velocity u and suspended sediment concentration ssc are available at these hydrologic stations fig 2 indicates that only one station i e miaohe can predict sediment information from wanxian station to the tgd therefore owing to little sediment information being available in this region flood and sediment regulation could not be effectively conducted based on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks therefore a 3d numerical simulation of flood and sediment transport was studied in the tgr the temporal variations of inflow discharge and sediment concentration measured during the flood period at wanxian were used as the inlet boundary condition in the model fig 3 a the red square in fig 3a represents the flow discharge peak in the flood hydrograph and the red circle in fig 3a represents the sediment peak corresponding to the flow discharge peak the sediment peak lagged behind the corresponding flow discharge for a certain time in this study reach there are several tributaries fig 1 c whose flow discharge is small compared to the inlet flow discharge as shown in table 1 therefore the flow discharge of the tributaries is not considered in the model the temporal variations of water level recorded during the flood period at maoping station were used as the outlet boundary condition in the model fig 3 b the time is from july 1 to august 1 in present simulation and the time interval was 32 days covering the entire process of sediment transport in a flood event in the upper reach of the tgr in the yangtze river the sediment transport was mainly in the form of suspended sediment fang and rodi 2003 jia et al 2014 during the flood period in july 2013 the sediment size distribution of the suspended sediment measured at wanxian station is shown in fig 4 the inflow sediment was mainly suspended sediment and the sediment particle diameter was in the range of 0 002 0 062 mm considering that the sediment size with particle diameters of 0 002 and 0 004 mm was small these two classes of sediment were aggregated with that having 0 003 mm diameter for modelling purposes thus in this study five sediment sizes were considered for the simulation as shown in table 2 in general the coarsest sediment sizes are deposited close to the inflow area while the finer sediments are transported further downstream into the reservoir jia et al 2014 the study region of the tgr covered a total of 72 cross sectional locations where the composition of the bed material was measured before the flood season the setup of bed sediment size was the same as that of the suspended sediments at wanxian the composition of the bed material was obtained from an interpolation based on the locations of the total 72 cross sections as shown in fig 5 3 numerical simulation method a 3d numerical model schism based on unstructured grid model zhang and baptista 2008 zhang et al 2016 is adopted in this study it is an open source community supported modeling system based on mixed triangular quadrangular unstructured grids in the horizontal and a very flexible coordinate system in the vertical zhang et al 2015 the model is solved with finite element and finite volume techniques semi implicit schemes are applied to solve the navier stokes equations to improve stability and maximize the efficiency to treat the advection terms in the momentum equation the model uses a higher order eulerian lagrangian method allowing the use of high time steps without compromising the model precision and the stability the very robust wetting and drying scheme used in schism is suitable to model flood propagation and inundation studies 3 1 flow governing equations in cartesian coordinate system the governing equations based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with hydrostatic and

considering salinity and temperature ρ a is the atmospheric pressure at the free surface g is the acceleration of gravity μ is the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient which is a model specific constant and υ is the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient which is closed with the turbulence closure the density field is determined from an equation of state that accounts for suspended sediment concentrations the water density is calculated as follows 4 ρ ρ f i 1 n c i ρ s i ρ s i ρ f where ρ is the fluid local density including the salinity temperature and sediment effects ρ f is the water density including salinity and temperature effects and n i is the total number of sediment classes the effect of the salinity and temperature on the density field is neglected in the present studies for the turbulence closure the generic length scale gls proposed by umlauf and burchard 2003 is used in the numerical model which has the advantage of encompassing most of the 2 5 equation closure models k ε rodi 1984 k ω wilcox 1998 the two standard equations of the turbulent kinetic energy k and a generic length scale variable ψ are expressed by 5 dk dt z ν k ψ υ m 2 μ n 2 ε 6 d ψ dt z ν ψ ψ

model specific constants the stability functions s m and s h are given by an algebraic stress model galperin et al 1988 kantha and clayson 1994 canuto et al 2001 the specific choices of the constants p m and n lead to the different closure models in this study the k ε model is adopted as the turbulence closure model the related parameters in the model are in table 3 at the free surface and at the bottom the turbulent kinetic energy and the mixing length are specified as direchlet boundary conditions 12 k 1 2 b 1 2 3 τ b 2 13 l κ d b o r κ d s where τ b is a bottom frictional stress κ 0 4 is the von kármán constant b 1 is a constant and d b and d s are the distances to the bottom and the free surface respectively the classic logarithmic distribution of the vertical velocity in the interior boundary layer is defined by a shear velocity and bottom roughness length 14 u u κ ln δ b z 0 where u u 2 v 2 u τ bx τ by ρ z 0 is the bottom roughness length and δ b is the bottom computational layer thickness 3 2 sediment transport equations the suspended sediment transport for sediment in schish derived from the coupling of the transport formulation and the roms sediment transport formulation warner et al 2008 the model has an advantage of being able to calculate an unlimited number of sediment size classes for each sediment class the model solves the horizontal and vertical advection the vertical diffusion the vertical settling velocity and bottom sediment deposition or erosion the suspended sediment transport for each sediment class i is calculated by solving the advection diffusion equation as follows 15 c i t u c i x v c i y w ω f i c i z z ν c i z μ 2 c i x 2 2 c i y 2 d q e q where c i is the sediment concentration for class i u v and w are velocity in three directions respectively and ω f i is the sediment settling velocity for class i e q and d q is the erosion flux and deposition flux respectively the phenomenon of sediment flocculation is widespread in tgr the settling velocity of cohesive sediment depends on the floc size concentration of particles and organic content of the sediment li et al 2018 the flocculation process is dynamic and complex the critical particle size of sediment flocculation in the tgr is about 0 02 mm based the measured data the flocculation factor f is commonly used to quantify the change in the settling velocity of sediment before and after flocculation huang 1981 16 f ω f i ω s i where ω f i is settling velocity with flocculation effect and ω s i is the free settling velocity of a single sediment particle in the clear water calculated by the stokes formulation 17 ω s i ρ s ρ f g d i 2 18 ρ f v the more widely used form of flocculation factor in the three gorges reservoir is 18 f α d β where the parameter α is generally 0 0007 0 0013 0 0055 β is 1 9 and 1 02 huang 1981 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 studied the attenuation law of sediment peak from the wanxian to miaohe station in the reservoir and the coefficient α and β adopted in their study for modified formula of sediment flocculation were 0 0055 and 1 02 respectively therefore the same coefficient is used in this study the sediment exchange between the bed and the flow is calculated based on erosion flux e q and deposition flux d q acting on the bottom computational cell thus the net suspended sediment flux is given by d q e q the deposition flux is defined by 19 d q ω f i c 1 where c 1 are the sediment concentration computed at the bottom computational cell the erosion flux proposed by ariathurai and arulanandan 1978 is written as 20 e i e 0 i 1 q φ i τ b τ cr i i f τ b τ cr i where e i is a bed erodibility constant and determined based on local bed sediment conditions the value is ranging from 10 4 to 10 2

bx 2 τ by 2 is the bed shear stress in present study the density field is determined from an equation of state that accounts for suspended sediment concentrations the water density is calculated as follows 21 ρ ρ w i 1 n c i ρ s i ρ s i ρ f where ρ is the fluid local density including the salinity temperature and sediment effects ρ f is the water density including salinity and temperature effects and n is the total number of sediment classes the effect of the salinity and temperature on the density field is neglected in the present study 3 3 bed evolution module the sediment bed changes due to the local erosion and deposition under the bed shear stress the total depth variation δ h is calculated in the prism center and is given by the sum of the depth variations of each sediment class due to suspended sediment transport the net sediment bed changes due to suspended sediment transport are calculated for each sediment class q i as 22 δ h d q e q δ t ρ s 1 p the change from the prism centers to the nodes is made as follows 23 δ h sn e 1 nel a e δ h e 1 nel a e where δ h se is the element depth variation due to the suspended transport and nel is the number of elements that contain the node n the sediment bed is assumed as a user specified constant number of sediment layers and total sediment thickness beneath the water column each layer in sediment bed is initialized with a given thickness sediment class distribution porosity the bed layers are modified at each time step to account for erosion deposition and track stratigraphy more details can be found in paper of warner et al 2008 4 setup and validation of numerical model the schish model has been applied in open channels to investigate the sediment deposition process sediment concentration profiles and morphological evolution pinto et al 2012 the model s accuracy stability and robustness were verified by zhang et al 2020 to study the physical processes in compound flooding events in delaware bay the schism model requires no bathymetry smoothing and avoids the detrimental effects of smoothing on the physics of the process ye et al 2020 to adapt to the sharp slope and variable water level in the vertical dimension and the stratification effect of sediment concentration a new vertical coordinate system named localised sigma coordinates with shaved cell lsc2 proposed by zhang et al 2015 was adopted in this study which was demonstrated to have the benefits of both terrain following and z coordinate system the following section described the setup parameter sensitivity analysis and validation of the numerical model through its comparison with the measured results in the process of flood propagation in july 2013 in the tgr 4 1 setup and parameter sensitivity analysis of numerical model for such a large scale numerical simulation the grid setup is very crucial for the numerical model to not only ensure the accuracy of the results but also save some computational resources using very fine meshes is not a preferred option for a large computational domain as huge computational costs are incurred to simulate flood propagation in a 3 d numerical model munoz and constantinescu 2018 fang and rodi 2003 used a curvilinear non orthogonal grid to simulate the flow field and suspended sediment transport in the neighbourhood of the tgd the smallest spacings between the adjacent grid nodes in the stream wise lateral and vertical directions were 70 25 50 and 5 6 m respectively a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of grid size and manning roughness coefficient on the accuracy of the model results and the efficiency of the calculation in this study the flow discharge basically remained constant the effect of the grid setup on the modelled results was evaluated with a change in water level at wanxian and fengjie hydrological stations these two are located at the inlet and middle reaches in the tgr fig 2 and a comparison between the measured and modelled water levels reflected the sensitivity of the grid setup on the results the sensitivity analysis cases were modelled using 196 cores on the explore 100 cluster system of the tsinghua national laboratory for information science and technology the horizontal grid was set as triangular meshes with sizes of 28 25 and 22 m respectively and the details of the model setup are listed in table 4 the effect of the size of the horizontal grid on the water level is presented in fig 6 in which fig 6 a b presents the temporal variations of water level at the wanxian and fengjie hydrological stations fig 6 c presents the change in the water level along the thalweg from wanxian to the tgd this indicates that the simulated water level gradually decreased as the horizontal grid size decreased furthermore the computation time increased as the horizontal grid decreased when the mesh size was set to 22 m the modelled results were in good agreement with the measured results the variation in the water level indicates that the horizontal grid had a large influence on the modelled results to analyse the effect of the vertical grid size on the modelled results the vertical grid was set to sizes of 10 7 and 5 m respectively and the details of the model setup are presented in table 5 the effect of the vertical grid on the water level is presented in fig 7 fig 7 a b presents the temporal variation of water level at wanxian and fengjie fig 7 c presents the change in the water level along the thalweg from wanxian to the tgd this indicates that the water level gradually decreased as the mean vertical grid count increased furthermore the computation time increased as the mean vertical grid count increased the variation in the water level indicates that the vertical grid had a relatively small influence on the modelled results the manning roughness coefficient is also an important parameter for the simulation three model cases were conducted to analyse the effect of the manning coefficient on the propagation of flood and sediment peaks castillo et al 2015 indicated that the manning roughness coefficients for the floodplain and main channel were different considering the storage level of the tgr the gravel bed load gradually got deposited in the fluctuating backwater zone while the finer suspended sediment reached the dam fang and rodi 2003 jia et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 therefore the manning roughness coefficient for the main channel and floodplain was set to different values in this study manning roughness coefficients n1 and n2 were used under a water level of 130 m and above a water level of 130 m respectively fig 8 presents the effect of the manning roughness coefficient on the propagation of the simulated flood and sediment peaks fig 8 a indicates that the manning roughness coefficient had an insignificant influence on the flood peak castillo et al 2015 pointed out that this coefficient decreased as the flow discharge increased the manning coefficient was not sensitive to the flood peak propagation with a large flow discharge the influence of the manning coefficient on sediment concentration was mainly reflected in the speed of the sediment peak propagation it can be seen from fig 8 b that the smaller the manning coefficient the faster the sediment peak propagation the increase in the manning coefficient resulted in a decrease in the average flow velocity accordingly the decrease in the average flow velocity led to a decrease in the sediment carrying capacity therefore the sediment peak decayed more easily 4 2 validation of the numerical model to adapt to complex terrain and reduce computation resources a numerical model was built based on a mixed triangular quadrangular horizontal grid a quadrangular grid was used in the wide main channel with a 23 24 m grid size and an irregular triangular grid was used in the floodplain and the narrow canyon with a 21 23 m grid size the total number of nodes and elements in the computational frame were 495 662 and 856056 respectively along the horizontal dimension the elevation of each node was interpolated from the measured topography in 2011 and the elevation of the local topography is shown in fig 9 a b the spacing of the vertical grid was set to 5 m and the vertical grid of a local cross section is shown in fig 9 c to accommodate these grid sizes the time step in this simulation was set to 30 s the simulated case required approximately 8 days to model with 280 cores on the explore 100 cluster system of the tsinghua national laboratory for information science and technology in the entire tgr spanning approximately 660 km the hydrological stations with flow discharge average flow velocity sediment concentration and water level included zhutuo cuntan qingxichang wanxian and miaohe stations fig 1 b in this study in the reach between wanxian hydrologic station to the tgd the fengjie wushan miaohe maoping hydrological stations are located however only the miaohe hydrological station records the flow discharge average flow velocity sediment concentration and water level while the other hydrological stations contain only the water level information fig 1 c the flow discharge flow velocity and sediment concentration at important hydrological stations are not measured every day because of the constraints of the harsh environment during the flooding days the available daily measured data were interpolated based on the measurement data using an empirical regression model or formulae zhou et al 2016 for the important hydrological stations in the tgr such as zhutuo cuntan qingxichang wanxian and miaohe the detailed vertical velocity and sediment concentration at a stations were recorded only twice during the annual flood season owing to the measurement environment limitations the measurement method adopted a five point method to verify the accuracy of the numerical model a comparison of the modelled results and the measured water levels at fengjie wushan and miaohe stations as well as the flow discharge cross sectional average flow velocity and sediment concentration at miaohe station were analyzed fig 10 presents the comparisons of water level between the modelled and measured results at three hydrological stations this shows that the modelled results were in good agreement with the measured results some local differences may have been caused by the accuracy issues with the grid and the local manning roughness the bed roughness was difficult to measure accurately over such a long reach this indicates that the numerical model had the ability to simulate large changes in water levels fig 11 presents comparisons of the flow discharges and average flow velocities between the modelled and measured results at miaohe station it shows that the modelled results are generally consistent with the measured results the local difference may have resulted from the inflow of tributaries through an analysis of the amount of tributary runoff it was found that the flow discharge of tributaries accounts for 1 of the runoff of wanxian station fig 12 presents the comparisons of sediment concentration between the modelled and measured results at miaohe station it shows that the model results are basically consistent with the measured sediment concentration points however there are some errors in the average daily sediment concentration because it is based on an interpolation of measured values using a sediment concentration regression model zhou et al 2016 with an estimated maximum sediment peak error of 14 the minor difference between the model results and measured data may have resulted from the local erosion and deposition in such a complicated terrain to further verify the accuracy of the numerical model the modelled vertical velocity and sediment concentration were compared with the measured data for the important hydrological stations in three gorges reservoir such as zhutuo cuntan qingxichang wanxian and miaohe stations the detailed vertical velocity and sediment concentration at each station were recorded twice during the annual flood season due to measurement environment limitations the measurement was conducted using the five point method comparisons of the vertical velocity and sediment concentration between the modelled and measured data are shown in fig 13 the locations of the gauging points at the miaohe station together with the instantaneous distributions of the modelled velocity and sediment concentration are shown in fig 14 the comparison of the flow velocity between the modelled and measured results indicates that the model flow velocity is consistent with the measured results except for some deviation at the bottom of the flow for the comparison of suspended sediment concentration overall the modelled results are basically consistent with the measured results however there were some differences between the two gauging points points a and b some model tests were conducted by adjusting the sediment settling velocity and proportion of different particle size classes for this errors a possible reason for the difference is that the bed load sediment movement is not considered in the model which leads to a low sediment concentration at the bottom of gauging points a and b other reasons may be terrain and measurement errors the instantaneous vertical distributions of the modelled velocity and suspended sediment concentration in fig 14 indicate that the suspended sediment concentration is not uniformly distributed on the cross section and presents the stratification effect jia et al 2014 indicated that the maximum concentration of the suspended load occurred at the convex side while the minimum was at the concave side owing to the impact of the secondary currents in the bend river 5 results and analysis water storage of the tgp was divided into three stages according to the storage level namely 135 145 m and 175 m fig 15 the first impoundment was in 2003 and it operated at 135 m in the flood season the reservoir was refilled with water in 2006 and it operated at 145 m in the flood season and at 155 m in the dry season at the end of the flood season in 2008 175 m of experimental water storage was carried out the tgp was completed in 2009 after 2010 the normal water level was 175 m the limit water level of flood control was 145 m at the beginning of the flood season and the control water level was 155 m in the low flow season to satisfy the requirements of power generation the main hydrographic stations with the information of flow discharge and sediment concentration in the upstream of tgr were zhutuo cuntan qingxichang wanxian and miaohe as shown in fig 1b and fig 15 the backwater zone of the tgr about 600 km long extended to the chongqing section zhutuo station the water storage zone in the tgr was divided into a perennial backwater zone and a variable backwater zone according to the operational water level in front of the dam ren et al 2020 the river reach between zhutuo and cuntan was in the natural river state and was not influenced by the impounded water of the tgr the river reach between cuntan and qingxichang was in the fluctuating backwater zone at the tail of the tgr the river reach between qiangxichang and the tgd was in the perennial backwater zone in the tgr wanxian is located in the middle of the tgr and the riverbed elevation is less than 145 m in the flood season the tgr operates at a lower level 145 m and in the dry season it operated at a higher level 155 m therefore the reach between wanxian and tgd is affected by the storage water level of the tgr throughout its operating time after the impounded water of the tgr the large rise in the water level and the change in the water and sediment environment in the upper reaches of the tgr both affect the propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks in the reservoir which in turn affect the operation and sedimentation of the tgr ren et al 2020 5 1 propagation process of flood and sediment peaks the 3d numerical model has the advantage of being able to more precisely calculate the flow velocity and sediment concentration than the 2d model of an average cross section to analyse the propagation process of flood propagation and sediment transport in the tgr the flood event in july 2013 were simulated fig 16 shows the instantaneous modelled results of the 3d flow field in parts of the tgr this indicates that the flow velocity is unevenly distributed owing to the effects of the topographical structure and channel pattern overall the flow velocity in the upstream reservoir is greater than that in front of the dam except for some canyons because of the increase in water depth fig 17 a c shows the instantaneous contours of the modelled suspended sediment concentration at the arriving stage propagating process and passing away of sediment peak along the thalweg in the entire study reach respectively the sediment concentration distribution indicates that it was evidently different at different stages of sediment peak propagation before the onset of the sediment peak and after its passing away the sediment concentration distribution followed the general rouse distribution in that the sediment concentration at the upper part of the flow was small while at the lower part it was large fig 17 a c however in the process of forward propagation of the sediment peak the sediment concentration distribution indicates that at the upper part of the flow it was larger and at the lower part it was smaller fig 17b this indicates that the distribution of high sediment concentration in the strong unsteady flow was different from that in the constant or weak unsteady flow this was related to the distribution of flow velocity during the process of flood propagation the higher flow velocity with high concentration sediment propagated faster which led to a higher sediment concentration in the upper part than in the lower part from the turbulent kinetic energy of the flow it appears that the high concentration sediment had an inhibitory effect on water turbulence this is consistent with the flume experiment wang and qian 1989 asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks there are various flood wave types according to the simplification of the shallow water wave theory including kinematic diffusion gravity and dynamic waves and these waves have different celerities miller 1984 singh and li 1993 a flood wave propagation diagram of river course reservoir is shown in fig 18 a flood wave has the characteristics of both kinematic and dynamic waves referring to fig 18 h 0 is the water depth of the base flow h and h m are the wave height at a certain section and the maximum height respectively λ is the half wavelength and i is the bed slope when h h 0 the kinematic wave is dominant and thus the flood wave is a kinematic wave the kinematic wave is transported at a celerity 24 c k u k 1 2 when h h 0 the dynamic wave is dominant and thus the flood wave is a dynamic wave the celerity of the dynamic wave is 25 c u g h 0 where u is the average flow velocity during the propagation of flood waves in rivers based on the relative heights of the wave amplitude and water depth eqs 24 25 when the flood wave propagates in the river course reservoir it gradually changes from a kinematic wave to a dynamic one the natural flow regimes of the yangzte river have been altered by the construction of the tgd from cuntan station to the tgd the water depth gradually increased fig 15 therefore the propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment transport upstream of the tgr were also altered to further analyse the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks downstream in the upstream reaches of the tgr during the flood season in this study three simulation cases based on different operating scenarios were set up the distinction among these three operating scenarios was the difference in the water level ahead of the tgd as shown in fig 19 the temporal variations of flow discharge and sediment concentration at five hydrological stations fig 2 were obtained based on the modelled results to investigate the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream in the tgr fig 20 presents a comparison of the temporal variations of modelled flow discharge and sediment concentration at the hydrological stations under different operating scenarios it shows that for the same hydrological stations as the impounded level increased the earlier the flood peak arrived the faster the flood wave propagated the sediment peak arrived later as the impounded level increased the sediment peak travelled slower because the increase in the water level led to a decrease in the average flow velocity the change in the impounded level had an insignificant effect on the occurrence time and magnitude of the flood peak but a significant effect on the occurrence time and magnitude of the sediment peak for the same operating water level for example in case 2 the temporal variations of the modelled flow discharge and sediment concentration at different hydrological stations are presented in fig 21 this shows that as the flood propagated downstream the value of the flood peak decreased gradually owing to the discharged flow small fluctuations in the flood peak curve appeared at the downstream this was because of the reflection and mutual interference of waves of the water body with different frequencies held by the tgd and the load shedding of the hydraulic turbines li and singh 1993 the sediment concentration decreased gradually as the flood propagated downstream at different hydrological stations the reason was that as the flood propagated downstream the increase in the water depth resulted in a decrease in the sediment carrying capacity of the flow which resulted in an increase in the sediment deposition accordingly the sediment peak gradually decayed owing to sediment settlement zhang et al 2018 studied the attenuation of the sediment peak upstream of the tgr and pointed out that the attenuation of the sediment peak was related to the length flow discharge and suspended sediment particle gradation to quantitatively analyse the effect of the impounded level of the tgr on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks downstream the modelled results of the arrival time and lag time of flood and sediment peaks at the hydrological stations under different operating scenarios are shown in table 6 it is indicated that the change in the impounded level of the tgr had less effect on the arrival time of the flood peak propagation but had a large impact on the arrival time of the sediment peak from the time of the sediment peak lagging behind the flood peak it appears that the lag time increased as the impounded level of the tgr increased in addition the lag time increased as the flood propagated downstream under the same operational water level the measured hydrological data from the bureau of hydrology changjiang water resources commission indicated that in the case of a major flood the flow discharge peak took 18 30 h to propagate from the cuntan hydrological station to the tgd while it took 3 7 days for the sediment peak zheng 2016 for the same traversal dong et al 2014b analysed the sediment transport data from the tgr during the flood season in 2012 and the propagation time of the sediment peaks varied from 3 to 7 days this indicates that the time of sediment peak lagging behind the flood peak could be adjusted by regulating the impounded level ahead of the tgd the sediment peak regulation takes advantage of the lag between the sediment and flood peaks to release the flood water with high sediment concentration by timely opening of the flood discharge gate and storing of water with a lower sediment concentration in a timely manner by closing the flood discharge gate analysis of the lagging time of sediment peak behind the flood peak the tgr began filling water in 2002 and the entire project was completed in 2009 the water level ranges from 130 to 175 m in this study the water depth was much greater than the wave amplitude and the flood wave propagated as a dynamic wave the travel time of the flood peak is 26 t fp l c l u g h 0 in the tgr the water depth is much larger and the average flow velocity is very small thus the travel time of the flood peak is approximately equal to l g h 0 in the perennial backwater area of the tgr the propagation time of the flood peak is mainly determined by the reservoir water level generally speaking the sediment absorbed energy from the flow and is transported along with it the velocity of the sediment transport is basically equal to the average flow velocity then the travel time of the sediment peak huang et al 2019a 2019b is 27 t sp l u al au v q where q is the average flow discharge a is the channel sectional area and v is the flow volume in the river the travel time of the sediment peak is mainly determined by the flow discharge and the reservoir storage for a reservoir the capacity depends on the water level fig 22 presents the relationship between the water level and reservoir storage in the tgr the empirical relationship between the reservoir capacity and water level obtained through curve fitting in the tgr is as follows 28 v 10 8 7 976 e 0 02299 l w 5 3322 where l w is the water level ahead of the dam combined with eqs 26 28 the empirical formula for the lag time of the sediment peak behind the flood peak is 29 δ t 10 8 7 976 e 0 02299 l w 5 3322 q l g h 0 therefore the time of the sediment peak lagging the flood peak mainly depends on the inflow discharge and reservoir water level this lag time is directly proportional to the storage water level and inversely proportional to the flow discharge in the study the simulated reach is from wanxian hydrological station to the tgd which is a part of the tgr fig 15 the modelled case 2 is the actual operation conditions of tgr from the temporal variations in inflow flow discharge and sediment concentration at wanxian station fig 3 a the lag time of sediment peak behind flood peak is 2 days so the modelled results of sediment peak lagging behind flood peak is the total lag time including the lag time between cuntan wanxian and wanxian tgd in actual operating conditions the lag time between wanxian station and the tgd is 6 33 days however the modelled case 1 and 3 are assumed operating scenarios and the lag time between cuntan wanxian and wanxian tgd can only be estimated the estimated lag time is shown in table 7 the comparison of the lag time between the modelled results and the calculated results in the whole tgr is presented in fig 23 it is indicated that there is some error between the modeled and calculated results based on the eq 29 upstream of the tgr the asynchronous propagation phenomenon of the flood and sediment peaks is a complex multi factor driven process huang et al 2019a 2019b the main factors included the uneven distribution of time and space of rainfall different mechanisms of the runoff and sediment yield runoff inflow of tributaries flood and sediment transport mechanisms attenuation of sediment concentration storage water level and reservoir operation regulation they affect the asynchronous propagation characteristics of flood and sediment peaks to accurately forecast the arrival time of the flood and sediment peaks reaching the dam during the rising period of the flood the discharged flow is lowered to reduce the flood peak when the sediment peak reaches the dam the discharged flow is increased to release the high concentration sediment during the recession period of the flood and to reduce the sedimentation in the reservoir the multi drivers of propagation phenomenon of flood peak and sediment peak will be further studied in future studies 6 conclusions in this study the 3d numerical model schish was adopted to simulate the processes of flood propagation and sediment transport during the flood season in the tgr on a large scale the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks downstream were preliminarily analysed based on the model results under different impounded levels the main conclusions are summarised as follows 1 the 3d numerical model could simulate flood propagation and sediment transport processes accurately on a large scale the error between the model results and measured values may have resulted from the local grid size bed roughness and inflow of the tributaries the sensitivity analysis showed that the horizontal grid had a greater influence on the model results than the vertical grid the manning coefficient was not sensitive to flood peak propagation with large flow discharge but and had a certain influence on the sediment peak propagation process the larger the manning coefficient the slower the sediment peak propagation the sediment peak decayed more easily 2 the flood propagation is a strong unsteady hydrodynamic process the distribution of high sediment concentration in the strong unsteady flow was different from that in the constant or weak unsteady flow in the process of forward propagation of the sediment peak the sediment concentration distribution indicates that at the upper part of the flow it was larger and at the lower part it was smaller and was different than the general rouse distribution this was related to the distribution of flow velocity and the higher flow velocity with high concentration sediment propagated faster which led to a higher sediment concentration in the upper part than in the lower part 3 in the channel type reservoir the propagation mechanism of water flow is changed due to the increase of water depth the velocity difference of flood wave propagation and sediment transport leaded to the asynchronous propagation phenomenon between flood peak and sand peak the impounded level in the tgr had less effect on the propagation time and magnitude of the flood peak but had a significant influence on the propagation time and magnitude of the sediment peak as the water depth increases the time of sand peak lagging behind the flood peak gradually increases based on the asynchronous propagation characteristics of the flood and sediment peaks in the flood propagation process the discharged flow is lowered to reduce the flood peak during the rising period of the flood and when the sediment peak reaches the dam the discharged flow is increased to release high concentration sediment this is one of the effective methods to reduce the tgr sedimentation the research results could provide a scientific basis for further optimising the sediment peak regulation and the 3d numerical model could provide a reliable real time tool to predict the arrival time of the flood and sediment peaks in the tgr funding this work was financed by the

4963,droughts evolve in space and time simultaneously but its spatio temporal propagation remains less explored as one of the hotspot regions in global soil moisture sm drought the southeastern asia supports billions of population and trillions of dollars in gross domestic product its high drought risk initiated a deep understanding of drought propagation in multiple dimensions for effective prevention this study investigated the sm droughts with a merged dataset of remote sensing and land surface modeling over 1979 2016 our results showed that 369 drought clusters and 145 drought events occurred spatially severe droughts appeared mainly in southwest and northeast of the study region temporally the droughts were more severe in cold season winter and spring than warm season summer and autumn in last four decades the sm droughts alleviated in warm season but aggravated in cold season significantly posing a challenge for drought mitigation especially for spring crop growth vigorously furthermore the drought clusters shared two predominant routes of westward and southwest the westward route is for the droughts started in winter in south region while the southwest route is for the droughts started in summer across the yangtze river basin from northeast to southwest at a drought event level the sm drought propagated synergistically with precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation was generally the primary driver and pet the secondary particularly for sm droughts lasting in summer and winter in south region the intensity of pet usually enhanced in spring and summer with temperature increasing and crop growing the findings in drought propagation provide essential spatiotemporal structure for mechanism exploration and important clues for drought prediction keywords soil moisture drought drought cluster drought propagation southeastern asia 1 introduction drought is a frequently occurred and widespread hydro climatic extreme phenomenon some drought events usually last from months to years and even evolve into serious natural hazards dai 2011 which have considerable unfavorable impacts on ecosystem hydrology agriculture and economy vicente serrano et al 2012 soil moisture sm governs the magnitude and variation of water and energy fluxes at land atmosphere surface being regarded as a key indicator in drought monitoring in particular for agricultural drought understanding the spatio temporal dynamics and evolution characteristics of sm drought is fundamental for further exploring its driving mechanisms and making accurate drought predictions which is significant for agriculture production and water management many studies have focused on drought investigation about its temporal e g frequency duration tendency and spatial e g area intensity severity characteristics sheffield and wood 2008 analyzed the global and regional trends of drought over 1950 2000 using a sm based drought index and explored its underlying driving factors in further andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 examined the drought trends of 20th century over the conterminous united states using a simulated data set of hydro climatological variables and found that droughts had become shorter and less frequent over most parts of the region liu et al 2016 provided a regional view of the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought conditions across the entire loess plateau and identified the variability and trends of drought at different spatial and temporal scales zhou and liu 2018 examined the spatial pattern of meteorological droughts in poyang lake basin in china and investigated the physical mechanism behind gocic and trajkovic 2014 evaluated the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in sebia based on the standard precipitation index spi using the principle component analysis approach in general previous researches usually identify drought events from time dimension and consequently analyze the drought characteristics from its temporal variations or spatial distributions separately while generally neglect the space time continuous property of the actual droughts the lower order subspace drought characteristic analysis tends to discard much of the spatio temporal information thus still insufficient in capturing the real characteristics of droughts e g the spatial position changes of a drought over time and the overall severity duration of a drought in space time domain lloyd hughes 2012 with the improvement of the distributed hydrological model in its spatial generalization and simulation ability in particular for the fast development of the satellite remote sensing and inversion techniques the availability of large scale spatio temporal continuous meteorological and hydrological variables e g precipitation soil moisture become possible lievens et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 it provides great advantages for time space joint investigation of large scale droughts to date some reports have taken the spatio temporal synchronous identification and characterization of droughts into consideration andreadis et al 2005 introduced a clustering algorithm to consider the spatial and temporal continuous property of individual drought events and constructed a series of severity area duration sad curves to integrate the spatio temporal information into drought characterization rather than reducing the drought analysis to a lower dimension lloyd hughes 2012 extended the clustering algorithm of andreadis et al 2005 into a longitude latitude time space and demonstrated this explicit 3 dimensional 3 d drought identification approach in the application of european drought analysis thereafter xu et al 2015 developed a 3 d clustering method and adopted it in a spatial and temporal variation analysis of meteorological droughts in non arid regions of china over last four decades the above cluster based drought identification and the innovative sad approaches provided a way to analyze the spatial and temporal synergistic changes of droughts which were adopted by many later researches e g sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhan et al 2016 zhai et al 2017 these researches characterize and investigate droughts in a space time continuous perspective which are informative in exploring the characteristics and processes of actual droughts yet most of the researches focus on spatial extent while obscures much of the spatial temporal evolution of the drought structure the spatial propagation process of droughts over time is the foundation to understand the forcing on drought development which makes it indispensable for drought mechanism exploration and drought prediction lloyd hughes 2012 however to our knowledge the explicit analysis on spatio temporal dynamic evolution of drought events is only limited to a few studies such as herrera estrada et al 2017 guo et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 and diaz et al 2020 what are the main places where drought frequently occurred and long lasted what are the dynamics of the drought clusters the spatial continuous regions under drought during individual events are there predominant routes followed by drought these issues are still subject to further investigation southeastern asia is the most populous region of the world it contributes trillions of dollars in gross domestic product with the world s second largest economy of china this region is also one of the world s favorable cultivation area with over 10 covered by arable agricultural land hannah and max 2013 however southeastern asia is one of the most active regions of sm droughts with high drought tracking capacity over the globe herrera estrada et al 2017 with global warming in recent years the drought issue in various regions of southeastern asia is increasingly prominent significant dry trends were detected in large parts of south china zhai et al 2017 liu et al 2019a the droughts became more intense and frequent in southwest of china during the past 50 years yang et al 2013 sun et al 2016 2017 in recent years poyang lake basin in lower yangtze river basin liu and wu 2016 even the whole yangtze river basin experienced serious drought issue zhou and liu 2018 huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 moreover it has been found that the significant dry periods become longer in pearl river basin located in southeastern china from 1961 to 2007 fischer et al 2011 the above serious drought conditions and scenarios bring huge damages to agriculture and ecosystem of southeastern asia where many developing regions countries are located considerable efforts have been dedicated to exploring the drought characteristics even the driving mechanisms from climate perspectives e g wang et al 2018 however as the primacy of understanding the drought property and exploring drought mechanism the spatio temporal dynamic evolutionary processes and characteristics of drought in southeastern asia remains ambiguous up to now therefore this study focuses on the spatio temporal dynamics and characteristics of sm droughts directly related to agriculture drought in southeastern asia with the objectives to i identify the sm drought events in spatial and temporal perspective simultaneously in last four decades ii investigate the spatial patterns and temporal variations of sm droughts comprehensively iii explore the spatio temporal propagation characteristic of sm droughts and iv analyze the development process of individual drought events 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study focused on the droughts in

largest river basin in china yangtze river basin is marked out here to highlight the location of the study region 2 2 data the soil moisture sm data used in this study is a merged multi satellite dataset developed in the climate change initiative cci project by european space agency esa liu et al 2011a 2011b the active and passive combined dataset 1979 2016 of esa cci sm version 04 2 was utilized here with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 a temporal resolution of 1 day and a soil moisture thickness of 2 cm for drought analysis 1 month sm dataset was generated from temporal averaging of the daily dataset considering that data missing problem of esa cci sm dataset would degrade its performance in drought application yuan et al 2015 the missing values for monthly esa cci sm were filled using the cumulative distribution frequency cdf matching approach reichle and koster 2004 based on a land surface modeling sm dataset from global land data assimilation system specifically the land surface modeling sm data utilized here is the surface 0 10 cm soil moisture from gldasv2 0 noah 1979 2010 and gldasv2 1 noah 2011 2016 after bias correction based on cdf matching approach the data gap filling and bias correction process was detailed in liu et al 2019a the data gap filling degree for the whole study region is present in figure s1 the precipitation potential and actual evapotranspiration data were adopted to support the sm drought study the monthly global precipitation climatology centre gpcc dataset from 1979 2016 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 were utilized the gpcc dataset was generated from the quality controlled data of 67 200 stations worldwide with the record duration of 10 years or more of which the data quality has been verified by many researches cattani et al 2016 schneider et al 2017 the potential evaporation rate pet and evapotranspiration et data were extracted from gldasv2 0 noah 1979 2010 and gldasv2 1 noah 2011 2016 datasets the biases both for pet or et between gldasv2 1 noah and gldasv2 0 noah were corrected using the cdf rescaling method on grid scale 3 methodology 3 1 drought event identification in a 3 d space time domain in this study 3 monthly sm anomaly percentage index 3 smapi is selected as it has been effectively applied in various long term regional and global drought assessment e g wu et al 2016 liu et al 2019a because this study focuses on the moderate and moderate above droughts a threshold of 0 15 is adopted to distinguish drought cases i e 3 smapi 0 15 is concerned as drought condition the drought event identification is based on a clustering method andreadis et al 2005 lloyd hughes 2012 in which the space time continuum structure of a drought is extracted from the 3 dimensional latitude longitude and time array of 3 smapi in specific the identification of the spatio temporal continuous drought events mainly includes the following two aspects 1 identification of the drought cluster at each time step month i e determination of the spatial continuity of the grid pixels under drought first the spatial noises of each 3 smapi monthly map are smoothed out using a 2 d median filter then the drought condition of each grid pixel over the whole region at each month from 1979 to 2016 is figured out based on the criterion of 3 smapi 0 15 the dry grid pixels with spatial continuity are regarded as one individual drought cluster small clusters with their area less than 62 500 km2 i e 100 grids approximately 1 5 of the study region are ignored in the following drought event identification procedure this area truncation practice is to avoid the appearance of spurious long drought events due to the tenuous spatial continuity the truncation threshold in this study is analogous to that adopted by liu et al 2019b and wang et al 2011 2 determination of the temporal continuity of drought clusters the temporal connection of drought clusters between adjacent months is determined based on the criterion of their overlap area in space the drought clusters in adjacent months are regarded as belonging to one event if their overlap area is over 0 km2 similar to that in herrera estrada et al 2017 in this way the splitting or merging activity of drought clusters could be recorded during the drought propagation process 3 2 drought characterization to have a comprehensive understanding of the spatio temporal variations of droughts in 3 d space time domain the following drought characteristics are considered 1 drought duration it is the time interval from the beginning to the ending of one drought event in the 3 dimentional structure of one drought event drought duration is defined as the time length between the initial and the terminal time of the drought space 2 drought area it is defined as the total area affected by one drought event it is the projected area over the latitude longitude surface in the 3 d space time domain 3 drought severity s it indicates the degree of soil water deficit which is represented by a cumulative value of the 3 smapi over total grid pixels within the 3 d space time domain besides the grid based mean value of 3 smapi for the drought events at each month is defined as the drought intensity i t the calculation for drought severity and intensity is as follows 1 s t 1 d j 1 n i j t 2 i t 1 n j 1 n i j t where ij t indicates the drought intensity of jth grid for all drought clusters at month t in one event which is the corresponding value of 3 smapi on jth grid pixels n is the total grid number for the drought clusters at month t in one event d is the drought duration for one event 4 drought tracking characteristics drought events are tracked through time by searching for the overlapping grid pixels between temporal adjacent drought clusters in the 3 d drought event identification approach similar to such previous studies as xu et al 2015 herrera estrada et al 2017 and guo et al 2018 here the spatial changes of a drought over time are represented by the changes of the drought cluster centroids i e the weighted center of 3 smapi with 3 smapi value at each grid pixel within the drought cluster as weights during the drought development process the cluster centroids generate tracks as the drought displace from one to the next month which is defined as the drought cluster trajectory in one drought event one or several drought cluster trajectories might appear due to the merging or splitting activity of the drought cluster the monthly displacement of the drought cluster centroid is characterized by the distance and direction of two adjacent cluster centroids in time the total tracking distance of the drought cluster is the cumulative value of the centroid moving distance between adjacent time steps over the whole time span of its tracking process it indicates the extent and speed of the drought propagation the direction definition for monthly displacement of drought cluster is referenced from konapala and mishra 2017 and diaz et al 2020 which is based on the angle θ between the horizontal axis and the line connecting the current and subsequent centroid specially when θ falls in 0 22 5 337 5 360 it indicates the cluster tracking to eastward θ in 22 5 67 5 indicates northeast θ in 67 5 112 5 indicates northward θ in 112 5 157 5 indicates northwest θ in 157 5 202 5 indicates westward θ in 202 5 247 5 indicates southwest θ in 247 5 292 5 indicates southward and θ in 292 5 337 5 indicates southeast 4 results 4 1 spatial distribution of soil moisture droughts based on the 3 d drought identification approach a total of 369 drought clusters and 145 drought events were identified over the region fig 1 b during 1979 2016 fig 2 gives an overview of the spatial distribution of sm droughts in terms of their frequency indicated by the total number of drought events and the accumulated drought duration and severity it can be found that the above three drought characteristic parameters present similar spatial pattern the northeast and southwest of the region experienced comparatively high frequency 10 events long duration 25 months and more severe 5 the smaller negative value represents the more severe droughts of sm droughts in last four decades moreover northern myanmar and the upper reach of han river basin the largest tributary of yangtze river endured the most severe drought condition as the number of drought events 20 the accumulated drought duration 50 months and the accumulated drought severity based on 3 smapi 8 to know the specific spatial distribution of the identified droughts occurred during 1979 2016 the drought cluster centroids represent the drought cluster s location together with their probability density are present in fig 3 both for the total period and for all four seasons generally the highest probability density i e more cluster centriods distributes in southwest and northeast of the region especially for northern myanmar and the upper reach of han river basin this is consistent with that denoted by the accumulated drought characteristic parameters fig 2 in addition the drought cluster s distribution presents seasonal variations in winter it mainly distributes in northeast and southwest of the region as well as south china in spring the drought in southwest spreads out to west and east and that in northeast stretches along northeast and southwest however the drought in southwest becomes less frequent in summer while that in northeast turns out to be more frequent in autumn the drought in southwest seems comeback again in addition to drought location the area and intensity of the identified drought clusters are shown in fig 4 clearly the drought clusters vary considerably in their area and intensity the area ranges from 100 to 1667 grids 625 km2 per grid and the intensity i e the area average 3 smapi value from 0 266 to 0 162 most drought clusters present moderate scale drought as their intensity falls in the range of 0 25 0 15 the severe drought cluster mainly distributes in southwest which is applicable for all four seasons in terms of the occurrence frequency of the drought cluster the sm drought is more frequent in winter 123 clusters and spring 125 clusters than that in summer 66 clusters and autumn 82 clusters for the monthly information see figure s2 a moreover the drought area and severity show comparatively larger value in winter and spring the cold season than that in summer and autumn the warm season figure s2 b and c it suggests that sm drought is more serious in cold season than warm season over the region 4 2 temporal variation of drought characteristics on an inter annual scale the soil moisture drought of the whole region does not have any significant p 0 05 trends in terms of the number of drought cluster the drought area and severity although large yearly changes presents figure s3 however the seasonal statistics display significant trends fig 5 plots the number of sm drought cluster and the drought area and severity in each season in winter the drought magnitude indicated by the number of drought cluster and drought area and severity display slight enhancing trend p 0 05 furthermore the enhancing trend becomes significant in spring as both the number of drought cluster drought area and severity increased significantly p 0 05 over time here the decreasing trend of the actual value of drought severity based on 3 smapi represents the increasing drought severity however in summer and autumn the sm drought presents more obvious weakening trend as the drought magnitude and severity decrease significantly p 0 05 overall the sm drought over southeastern asia aggravated in cold season winter and spring but alleviated in warm season summer and autumn to explore the causes behind the corresponding changes of sm closely related hydrological variable i e precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and evapotranspiration et in each season are investigated fig 6 in winter both precipitation and pet exhibit none significant p 0 05 trend while et show significant p 0 05 increasing trend the drying trend of sm might be impacted by the increasing pet and et as the increasing capacity of et would extract more moisture from soil and aggravate the sm drought in spring the precipitation displays slight decreasing trend while the pet and et increase significantly p 0 05 the significant drying trend of sm should probably be jointly influenced by the decreasing precipitation and the increasing pet as et is increased significantly in this case in summer and autumn the precipitation presents slight increasing trend while the pet and et increase significantly p 0 05 the wetting trend of sm might be related to the increasing precipitation although the increasing trend of precipitation is not significant it is much larger than et in the magnitude during warm season see figure s4 4 3 patterns of soil moisture drought trajectory among total 145 drought events identified in the framework of the 3 d approach 90 droughts lasted more than two months which formed 126 drought cluster trajectories during the drought propagating process in space fig 7 presents the cluster trajectories together with their cumulative 3 smapi value for the drought events started in each season to avoid spurious large changes of the cluster centroid s location due to its splitting or merging the cluster tracking with the largest overlap area between the current and subsequent cluster is accounted besides only the tracks with monthly displacements exceeds 150 km are considered lest that the small displacements might fall within the uncertainty of the cluster centroid s location herrera estrada et al 2017 it can be seen from fig 7 that the cluster tracks and the integrated intensity the cumulative 3 smapi of the events started in winter spring summer and autumn exhibit substantial difference in their spatial patterns for winter droughts i e the drought events started in winter and mostly lasted in winter and spring both northeast and south of the study region are active zone fig 7 a a predominant route of westward can be found in the cluster tracks located in south region it can be supported by the direction statistics in fig 8 a as the westward monthly displacements of the clusters takes up to 34 for winter droughts however for summer droughts i e the droughts started in summer and mostly lasting in summer and autumn the cluster tracks are no longer confined to northeast or southwest region a predominant route of southwest across yangtze river basin formed the cluster tracks toward southwest exceed over 43 of total tracks fig 8 a as for spring droughts the cluster displacements mostly take place in southwest and northeast region while no evident routes or directions are present fig 7 b fig 8 a for autumn droughts the southwest region is the most severe in terms of the integrated intensity any dominant tracking route or direction can hardly be found as the drought cluster tracks scattered in large parts fig 7 d fig 8 a regarding to the drought cluster tracking distance the seasonal statistics show that spring droughts have the shortest cluster trajectory on average while summer droughts usually have longer trajectories fig 8 b 4 4 spatio temporal developing process of individual drought events to have an insight into the development process of an individual drought event the spatio temporal propagating process of a drought is present explicitly in a 3 dimensional form as fig 9 in specific fig 9 shows the drought cluster together with its dynamic monthly displacements of four representative severe events started in winter drought event 200412 200507 spring drought event 199503 199506 summer drought event 198507 198601 and autumn drought event 199611 199706 with different spatial locations moreover the monthly anomaly of two predominant sm controlling factor i e precipitation the dominant sm input and potential evapotranspiration pet the dominant driver of sm output in hydrological cycle are also investigated over the 3 d drought affected area to illustrate the possible causes of sm drought considering the time lag of precipitation and pet on soil moisture drought van loon and van lanen 2012 the precipitation and pet monthly anomaly maps were accounted and observed 3 months earlier before the drought occurrence fig 10 the drought event 200412 200507 started in early winter in south china and migrated westward all the way to northern myanmar over 8 months of duration although during which the drought cluster splitting and merging phenomenon appeared fig 9 a the initial soil moisture drought was driven by persistent negative abnormal precipitation combined with comparatively strong pet capacity meanwhile the continuation of this drought was probably dominated by precipitation as its negative anomaly always existed in the drought area and presented a westward change over time fig 10 a and e the positive pet anomaly aggravated the sm drought condition to a certain extent as it also presented westward changes during the drought propagation process fig 10 e the drought event 199503 199506 started in early spring and did not disappear until midsummer the location of this drought did not change a lot figure s5 the occurrence of sm drought in march was resulted from the comparatively low precipitation since january coupled with the strong pet capacity since february due to crop growing likewise the drought persistence in spring and early summer were under the control of precipitation and pet synergistically as the negative precipitation anomaly distributed over the whole drought area and the positive pet anomaly presented similar patterns with sm drought cluster fig 10 b and f the drought event 198507 198601 started in midsummer in the middle part of yangtze river basin with two sm drought cluster appeared simultaneously in the north and south it travelled to southwest in summer and stranded in southwestern region over 5 months during autumn and winter the formulation and persistence of this drought is mainly driven by precipitation because the negative precipitation anomaly nearly filled the whole 3 d drought space however the impact of pet cannot be ignored particularly for sm droughts located in the middle part of yangtze river basin during summer it seems that the positive pet anomaly in summer contributed the appearance of sm drought while the negative pet anomaly after summer promoted its disappearance fig 10 c and g the drought event 199611 199706 started in late autumn in southwest of yangtze river basin mainly in yunnan province china stranded in southwest of the region over the whole winter and spring and finally disappeared as summer came the drought occurrence firstly in yunnan province should be driven by precipitation and pet as where the two drivers both present anomaly from august to november fig 10 d and h additionally the precipitation and pet monthly anomaly map also indicated that the southwest drought in winter was probably dominated by precipitation anomaly while the drought in spring should largely rely on the pet anomaly this change can be related to the temperature increase and the crop growing in spring overall the above spatio temporal development process of sm droughts and the precipitation and pet in drought space time structure indicated that sm drought propagated synergistically with precipitation and pet precipitation was generally the primary driver and pet the secondary particularly for the drought events lasting in summer and winter in south region nevertheless pet usually enhanced the sm drought condition in spring and summer due to the temperature increasing and the crop growing vigorously 5 discussion 5 1 robustness of the identified predominant route of drought two predominant routes of westward for winter droughts in south region and southwest for summer droughts across yangtze river basin from northeast to southwest of the region are recognized based on the 0 25 0 25 esa cci soil moisture data using smapi on 3 month scale fig 7 a and c for seasonal 3 monthly smapi soil moisture droughts the two predominant drought cluster tracking routes are ubiquitous or just specific for the 0 25 spatial resolution considering the fact that the specific information of soil moisture tends to disappear while the primary one usually remains with the declining of its spatial resolution owing to space averaging the drought tracking characteristics were investigated based on the coarse 0 5 0 5 and 1 0 1 0 spatial data both the 0 5 0 5 and 1 0 1 0 soil moisture data are resampled from the original 0 25 0 25 esa cci dataset using a spatial averaging method fig 11 shows the drought cluster trajectories together with their cumulative 3 smapi for the drought events started in winter and summer for both 0 5 0 5 and 1 0 1 0 cases it can be found that the spatial distribution and direction of the cluster tracks have certain changes among different spatial resolutions both for winter and summer droughts fig 7 a and c fig 11 a and b fig 11 c and d however both the westward predominant route for winter droughts and the southwest route for summer droughts still exists in the cases with lower spatial resolution it is also supported by the direction statistics of the drought cluster tracks fig 12 for winter droughts the westward monthly displacements of clusters are up to 48 and 39 in 0 5 0 5 and 1 0 1 0 cases respectively for summer droughts the cluster tracks toward southwest is 38 in 1 0 1 0 case although it is 22 in 0 5 0 5 case the total of southward southwest and westward is up to 70 overall the existence of the predominant route of westward for winter droughts in south region and southwest route for summer droughts across yangtze river basin should be objective 5 2 reasonability of the predominant route of drought droughts can span over large geographical areas and last for months drought propagation occurs in space and time simultaneously the underlying causes for drought propagation is still unclear as a significant number of physical processes related to atmospheric activity land atmosphere feedback and land surface process are involved in it to date two primary mechanisms of precipitation recycling and moisture transport have been linked to soil moisture drought propagation roy et al 2019 miralles et al 2019 precipitation recycling is from regional moisture recycling perspective mainly refers to the contribution of evapotranspiration et from a region to the precipitation of the same region in drought development eltahir and bras 1996 moisture transport focuses on the horizontal movement of water vapor which is interpreted as a process that drought reduce moisture exports downwind leading to less precipitation and possibly amplify the drought condition downwind in herrera estrada et al 2019 precipitation recycling is from the perspective of the impact of regional internal moisture circulation on drought propagation while moisture transport is from the effect of the decreased increased moisture from upwind to downwind on drought condition actually both the precipitation recycling and moisture transport mechanism are likely to co exist in soil moisture drought propagation in the above two mechanisms soil moisture drought propagation is inseparable with the primary controlling factor of sm i e precipitation prep the dominant sm input and potential evapotranspiration pet the dominant driver of sm output at a certain level pet prep precipitation could reflect the drying capacity potential of sm with the larger value indicates the more likely dryer of sm besides considering that pet affects sm variations through the actual et of the land surface soil and vegetation et should also be accounted as a prerequisite in sm drought propagation exploration hence we try to elaborate the reasonability of the identified predominant routes in our drought cluster tracking by analyzing the monthly variation of pet p and et combing the drought development mechanism of precipitation recycling and moisture transport the westward predominant route in droughts started in winter and lasting in winter half year winter and spring in south of the region can be interpreted as follows in winter and spring the actual et in south especially for southwest is still at relatively high level fig 14 because the temperature generally keeps above 10 centigrade with subtropical climate and both the vegetation growing and soil water bodies evaporation needs plenty of water supply under this condition the low abnormal prep combined with relatively high capacity of et pet tends to cause sm drought in terms of drought propagation the westward route in south is probably related to the expansion of the high drying capacity of sm i e high pet prep in space over time the black box fig 13 the westward expansion of dryness is likely related to the following two factors one is the prevailing easterly winds in winter mainly for dec and jan in eastern part of the south region and its upwind area the red box figure s6 the easterly winds would drive dry atmosphere westward and amplify the drought condition downwind as it is opposite to the general moisture transport direction of eastward ding et al 2018 wang and lin 2002 the other is the westerly and southwesterly winds in later winter and spring in south of the region the blue box figure s6 the prevailing westerly winds tend to drive moist atmosphere eastward and relieve the drought condition downwind as it is consistent with the general moisture transport direction of eastward fang et al 2013 ding et al 2018 besides it should be noteworthy that in north region sm droughts cannot be indicated by the substantially high pet prep in winter half year it is because the actual et is comparatively low there fig 14 dec to mar due to the limited evaporation from soil water bodies and the very little transpiration from the stagnant growth of vegetation subjected to the persistent low temperature subzero in general in winter and early spring correspondingly the southwest predominant route in droughts started in summer and lasting in summer half year summer and autumn across yangtze river basin can be illustrated below with the coming of summer the evaporation from soil water bodies increases and the plant grows vigorously and demands large amounts of water for transpiration over most of the region fig 14 the pet is usually high while the prep is often unevenly distributed in space and time caused by the seasonal northward advance and southward retreat of the rain belt ding and chan 2005 this contradiction between water demand and supply increases the probability of drought the monthly climatology shows that the low drying capacity of sm i e the low pet prep expands toward northeast and northwest the magenta box fig 13 which is largely impacted by the water vapor transport via the southwest monsoon from indian ocean and the southeast monsoon from pacific ocean jun to nov figure s6 based on the moisture transport mechanism the drought should propagate to the opposite direction i e southwest southeast with the low pet prep i e high level of moisture expansion probably because the drought over northeast southwest of the region is mainly impacted by the water vapor transport from southwest in summer half year the sm drought propagation presents a southwest predominant tracking route 6 conclusion to deepen the understanding of drought propagation in multiple dimensions for further drought mechanism exploration and effective drought prediction the soil moisture droughts in a hotspot region of southeastern asia were investigated based on a 3 dimensional latitude longitude and time drought identification approach with a merged dataset of remote sensing and land surface modeling over 1979 2016 the results demonstrated that i a total of 369 drought clusters and 145 drought events were identified based on 3 smapi spatially severe droughts mainly distributed in southwest and northeast of the study region the sm drought was more serious in cold season winter and spring than that in warm season summer and autumn in terms of the frequency area and severity of the drought cluster ii although the sm drought for the whole region did not show any distinct trend on an inter annual scale it presented significant p 0 05 trend on seasonal scale the drought in warm season alleviated but that in cold season aggravated prominently thus it would pose more challenges for future drought mitigation in cold season especially for spring with crop growing vigorously iii in drought cluster tracking two predominant routes of westward and southwest were recognized the westward route was shared by the droughts started in winter and lasted mainly in winter half year in south region while the southwest route was shared by the droughts started in summer and lasted mainly in summer half year across yangtze river basin from northeast to southwest of the region iv at an event level sm drought propagated synergistically with precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet generally precipitation was the primary driver and pet the secondary particularly for the droughts lasting in summer and winter in south region nevertheless the driving power of pet usually enhanced in spring and summer with the temperature increasing and the crop growing vigorously overall the current work gave a comprehensive investigation on the spatio temporal dynamics and characteristics of soil moisture droughts in a global hotspot region of southeastern asia with typical monsoon climate the existence of the predominant drought tracking route for seasonal sm droughts was largely confirmed based on the categorical analysis of season timing of drought the innovative drought tracking analysis could serve as important implications for investigation on drought migration patterns of other hotspot regions with monsoon climate the dynamics of sm droughts in the 3 d drought domain was interpreted in consideration of the dominant sm input precipitation and output pet the findings in drought propagation is the foundation to understand the driver on drought development which would also provide essential spatio temporal structure

4963,droughts evolve in space and time simultaneously but its spatio temporal propagation remains less explored as one of the hotspot regions in global soil moisture sm drought the southeastern asia supports billions of population and trillions of dollars in gross domestic product its high drought risk initiated a deep understanding of drought propagation in multiple dimensions for effective prevention this study investigated the sm droughts with a merged dataset of remote sensing and land surface modeling over 1979 2016 our results showed that 369 drought clusters and 145 drought events occurred spatially severe droughts appeared mainly in southwest and northeast of the study region temporally the droughts were more severe in cold season winter and spring than warm season summer and autumn in last four decades the sm droughts alleviated in warm season but aggravated in cold season significantly posing a challenge for drought mitigation especially for spring crop growth vigorously furthermore the drought clusters shared two predominant routes of westward and southwest the westward route is for the droughts started in winter in south region while the southwest route is for the droughts started in summer across the yangtze river basin from northeast to southwest at a drought event level the sm drought propagated synergistically with precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet precipitation was generally the primary driver and pet the secondary particularly for sm droughts lasting in summer and winter in south region the intensity of pet usually enhanced in spring and summer with temperature increasing and crop growing the findings in drought propagation provide essential spatiotemporal structure for mechanism exploration and important clues

phenomenon some drought events usually last from months to years and even evolve into serious natural hazards dai 2011 which have considerable unfavorable impacts on ecosystem hydrology agriculture and economy vicente serrano et al 2012 soil moisture sm governs the magnitude and variation of water and energy fluxes at land atmosphere surface being regarded as a key indicator in drought monitoring in particular for agricultural drought understanding the spatio temporal dynamics and evolution characteristics of sm drought is fundamental for further exploring its driving mechanisms and making accurate drought predictions which is significant for agriculture production and water management many studies have focused on drought investigation about its temporal e g frequency duration tendency and spatial e g area intensity severity characteristics sheffield and wood 2008 analyzed the global and regional trends of drought over 1950 2000 using a sm based drought index and explored its underlying driving factors in further andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 examined the drought trends of 20th century over the conterminous united states using a simulated data set of hydro climatological variables and found that droughts had become shorter and less frequent over most parts of the region liu et al 2016 provided a regional view of the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought conditions across the entire loess plateau and identified the variability and trends of drought at different spatial and temporal scales zhou and liu 2018 examined the spatial pattern of meteorological droughts in poyang lake basin in china and investigated the physical mechanism behind gocic and trajkovic 2014 evaluated the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in sebia based on the standard precipitation index spi using the principle component analysis approach in general previous researches usually identify drought events from time dimension and consequently analyze the drought characteristics from its temporal variations or spatial distributions separately while generally neglect the space time continuous property of the actual droughts the lower order subspace drought characteristic analysis tends to discard much of the spatio temporal information thus still insufficient in capturing the real characteristics of droughts e g the spatial position changes of a

hydrological variables e g precipitation soil moisture become possible lievens et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 it provides great advantages for time space joint investigation of large scale droughts to date some reports have taken the spatio temporal synchronous identification and characterization of droughts into consideration andreadis et al 2005 introduced a clustering algorithm to consider the spatial and temporal continuous property of individual drought events and constructed a series of severity area duration sad curves to integrate the spatio temporal information into drought characterization rather than reducing the drought analysis to a lower dimension lloyd hughes 2012 extended the clustering algorithm of andreadis et al 2005 into a longitude latitude time space and demonstrated this explicit 3 dimensional 3 d drought identification approach in the application of european drought analysis thereafter xu et al 2015 developed a 3 d clustering method and adopted it in a spatial and temporal variation analysis of meteorological droughts in non arid regions of china over last four decades the above cluster based drought identification and the innovative sad approaches provided a way to analyze the spatial and temporal synergistic changes of droughts which were adopted by many later researches e g sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhan et al 2016 zhai et al 2017 these researches characterize and investigate droughts in a space time continuous perspective which are informative in exploring the characteristics and processes of actual droughts yet most of the researches focus on spatial extent while obscures much of the spatial temporal evolution of the drought structure the spatial propagation process of droughts over time is the foundation to understand the forcing on drought development which makes it indispensable for drought mechanism exploration and drought prediction lloyd hughes 2012 however to our knowledge the explicit analysis on spatio temporal dynamic evolution of drought events is only limited to a few studies such as herrera estrada et al 2017 guo et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 and diaz et al 2020 what are the main places where drought frequently occurred and long lasted what are the dynamics of the drought clusters the spatial continuous regions under drought during individual events are there predominant routes followed by drought these issues are still subject to further investigation southeastern asia is the most populous region of the world it contributes trillions of dollars in gross domestic product with the world s second largest economy of china this region is also one of the world s favorable cultivation area with over 10 covered by arable agricultural land hannah and max 2013 however southeastern asia is one of the most active regions of sm droughts with high drought tracking capacity over the globe herrera estrada et al 2017 with global warming in recent years the drought issue in various regions of southeastern asia is increasingly prominent significant dry trends were detected in large parts of south china zhai et al 2017 liu et al 2019a the droughts became more intense and frequent in southwest of china during the past 50 years yang et al 2013 sun et al 2016 2017 in recent years poyang lake basin in lower yangtze river basin liu and wu 2016 even the whole yangtze river basin experienced serious drought issue zhou and liu 2018 huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 moreover it has been found that the significant dry periods become longer in pearl river basin located in southeastern china from 1961 to 2007 fischer et al 2011 the above serious drought conditions and scenarios bring huge damages to agriculture and ecosystem of southeastern asia where many developing regions countries are located considerable efforts have been dedicated to exploring the drought characteristics even the driving mechanisms from climate perspectives e g wang et al 2018 however as the primacy of understanding the drought property and exploring drought mechanism the spatio temporal dynamic evolutionary processes and characteristics of drought in southeastern asia remains ambiguous up to now therefore this study focuses on the spatio temporal dynamics and characteristics of sm droughts directly related to agriculture drought in southeastern asia with the objectives to i identify the sm drought events in spatial and temporal perspective simultaneously in last four decades ii investigate the spatial patterns and temporal variations of sm droughts comprehensively iii explore the spatio temporal propagation characteristic of sm droughts and iv analyze the development process of individual drought events 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study focused on the droughts in southeastern asia which is one of the most active areas i e hotspot regions where sm droughts occur and propagate see fig 1 a over the globe fig 1 b presents the whole study area between 20 n 40 n and 86 e 126 e this region is located in east asia monsoon climate zone with the most typical monsoon climate over the globe the multi year average surface sm varies between 0 1 and 0 45 m3 m3 the high sm mainly distributed in southeastern parts including the middle and lower reaches in south bank of yangtze river basin and the regions in zhejiang fujian and guangdong provinces in china fig 1 b as the largest river basin in china yangtze river basin is marked out here to highlight the location of the study region 2 2 data the soil moisture sm data used in this study is a merged multi satellite dataset developed in the climate change initiative cci project by european space agency esa liu et al 2011a 2011b the active and passive combined dataset 1979 2016 of esa cci sm version 04 2 was utilized here with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 a temporal resolution of 1 day and a soil moisture thickness of 2 cm for drought analysis 1 month sm dataset was generated from temporal averaging of the daily dataset considering that data missing problem of esa cci sm dataset would degrade its performance in drought application yuan et al 2015 the missing values for monthly esa cci sm were filled using the cumulative distribution frequency cdf matching approach reichle and koster 2004 based on a land surface modeling sm dataset from global land data assimilation system specifically the land surface modeling sm data utilized here is the surface 0 10 cm soil moisture from gldasv2 0 noah 1979 2010 and gldasv2 1 noah 2011 2016 after bias correction based on cdf matching approach the data gap filling and bias correction process was detailed in liu et al 2019a the data gap filling degree for the whole study region is present in figure s1 the precipitation potential and actual evapotranspiration data were adopted to support the sm drought study the monthly global precipitation climatology centre gpcc dataset from 1979 2016 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 were utilized the gpcc dataset was generated from the quality controlled data of 67 200 stations worldwide with the record duration of 10 years or more of which the data quality has been verified by many researches cattani et al 2016 schneider et al 2017 the potential evaporation rate pet and evapotranspiration et data were extracted from gldasv2 0 noah 1979 2010 and gldasv2 1 noah 2011 2016 datasets the biases both for pet or et between gldasv2 1 noah and gldasv2 0 noah were corrected using the cdf rescaling method on grid scale 3 methodology 3 1 drought event identification in a 3 d space time domain in this study 3 monthly sm anomaly percentage index 3 smapi is selected as it has been effectively applied in various long term regional and global drought assessment e g wu et al 2016 liu et al 2019a because this study focuses on the moderate and moderate above droughts a threshold of 0 15 is adopted to distinguish drought cases i e 3 smapi 0 15 is concerned as drought condition the drought event identification is based on a clustering method andreadis et al 2005 lloyd hughes 2012 in which the space time continuum structure of a drought is extracted from the 3 dimensional latitude longitude and time array of 3 smapi in specific the identification of the spatio temporal continuous drought events mainly includes the following two aspects 1 identification of the drought cluster at each time step month i e determination of the spatial continuity of the grid pixels under drought first the spatial noises of each 3 smapi monthly map are smoothed out using a 2 d median filter then the drought condition of each grid pixel over the whole region at each month from 1979 to 2016 is figured out based on the criterion of 3 smapi 0 15 the dry grid pixels with spatial continuity are regarded as one individual drought cluster small clusters with their area less than 62 500 km2 i e 100 grids approximately 1 5 of the study region are ignored in the following drought event identification procedure this area truncation practice is to avoid the appearance of spurious long drought events due to the tenuous spatial continuity the truncation threshold in this study is analogous to that adopted by liu et al 2019b and wang et al 2011 2 determination of the temporal continuity of drought clusters the temporal connection of drought clusters between adjacent months is determined based on the criterion of their overlap area in space the drought clusters in adjacent months are regarded as belonging to one event if their overlap area is over 0 km2 similar to that in herrera estrada et al 2017 in this way the splitting or merging activity of drought clusters could be recorded during the drought propagation process 3 2 drought characterization to have a comprehensive understanding of the spatio temporal variations of droughts in 3 d space time domain the following drought characteristics are considered 1 drought duration it is the time interval from the beginning to the ending of one drought event in the 3 dimentional structure of one drought event drought duration is defined as the time length between the initial and the terminal time of the drought space 2 drought area it is defined as the total area affected by one drought event it is the projected area over the latitude longitude surface in the 3 d space time domain 3 drought severity s it indicates the degree of soil water deficit which is represented by a cumulative value of the 3 smapi over total grid pixels within the 3 d space time domain besides the grid based mean value of 3 smapi for the drought events at each month is defined as the drought intensity i t the calculation for drought severity and intensity is as follows 1 s t 1 d j 1 n i j t 2 i t 1 n j 1 n i j t where ij t indicates the drought intensity of jth grid for all drought clusters at month t in one event which is the corresponding value of 3 smapi on jth grid pixels n is the total grid number for the drought clusters at month t in one event d is the drought duration for one event 4 drought tracking characteristics drought events are tracked through time by searching for the overlapping grid pixels between temporal adjacent drought clusters in the 3 d drought event identification approach similar to such previous studies as xu et al 2015 herrera estrada et al 2017 and guo et al 2018 here the spatial changes of a drought over time are represented by the changes of the drought cluster centroids i e the weighted center of 3 smapi with 3 smapi value at each grid pixel within the drought cluster as weights during the drought development process the cluster centroids generate tracks as the drought displace from one to the next month which is defined as the drought cluster trajectory in one drought event one or several drought cluster trajectories might appear due to the merging or splitting activity of the drought cluster the monthly displacement of the drought cluster centroid is characterized by the distance and direction of two adjacent cluster centroids in time the total tracking distance of the drought cluster is the cumulative value of the centroid moving distance between adjacent time steps over the whole time span of its tracking process it indicates the extent and speed of the drought propagation the direction definition for monthly displacement of drought cluster is referenced from konapala and mishra 2017 and diaz et al 2020 which is based on the angle θ between the horizontal axis and the line connecting the current and subsequent centroid specially when θ falls in 0 22 5 337 5 360 it indicates the cluster tracking to eastward θ in 22 5 67 5 indicates northeast θ in 67 5 112 5 indicates northward θ in 112 5 157 5 indicates northwest θ in 157 5 202 5 indicates westward θ in 202 5 247 5 indicates southwest θ in 247 5 292 5 indicates southward and θ in 292 5 337 5 indicates southeast 4 results 4 1 spatial distribution of soil moisture droughts based on the 3 d drought identification approach a total of 369 drought clusters and 145 drought events were identified over the region fig 1 b during 1979 2016 fig 2 gives an overview of the spatial distribution of sm droughts in terms of their frequency indicated by the total number of drought events and the accumulated drought duration and severity it can be found that the above three drought characteristic parameters present similar spatial pattern the northeast and southwest of the region experienced comparatively high frequency 10 events long duration 25 months and more severe 5 the smaller negative value represents the more severe droughts of sm droughts in last four decades moreover northern myanmar and the upper reach of han river basin the largest tributary of yangtze river endured the most severe drought condition as the number of drought events 20 the accumulated drought duration 50 months and the accumulated drought severity based on 3 smapi 8 to know the specific spatial distribution of the identified droughts occurred during 1979 2016 the drought cluster centroids represent the drought cluster s location together with their probability density are present in fig 3 both for the total period and for all four seasons generally the highest probability density i e more cluster centriods distributes in southwest and northeast of the region especially for northern myanmar and the upper reach of han river basin this is consistent with that denoted by the accumulated drought characteristic parameters fig 2 in addition the drought cluster s distribution presents seasonal variations in winter it mainly distributes in northeast and southwest of the region as well as south china in spring the drought in southwest spreads out to west and east and that in northeast stretches along northeast and southwest however the drought in southwest becomes less frequent in summer while that in northeast turns out to be more frequent in autumn the drought in southwest seems comeback again in addition to drought location the area and intensity of the identified drought clusters are shown in fig 4 clearly the drought clusters vary considerably in their area and intensity the area ranges from 100 to 1667 grids 625 km2 per grid and the intensity i e the area average 3 smapi value from 0 266 to 0 162 most drought clusters present moderate scale drought as their intensity falls in the range of 0 25 0 15 the severe drought cluster mainly distributes in southwest which is applicable for all four seasons in terms of the occurrence frequency of the drought cluster the sm drought is more frequent in winter 123 clusters and spring 125 clusters than that in summer 66 clusters and autumn 82 clusters for the monthly information see figure s2 a moreover the drought area and severity show comparatively larger value in winter and spring the cold season than that in summer and autumn the warm season figure s2 b and c it suggests that sm drought is more serious in cold season than warm season over the region 4 2 temporal variation of drought characteristics on an inter annual scale the soil moisture drought of the whole region does not have any significant p 0 05 trends in terms of the number of drought cluster the drought area and severity although large yearly changes presents figure s3 however the seasonal statistics display significant trends fig 5 plots the number of sm drought cluster and the drought area and severity in each season in winter the drought magnitude indicated by the number of drought cluster and drought area and severity display slight enhancing trend p 0 05 furthermore the enhancing trend becomes significant in spring as both the number of drought cluster drought area and severity increased significantly p 0 05 over time here the decreasing trend of the actual value of drought severity based on 3 smapi represents the increasing drought severity however in summer and autumn the sm drought presents more obvious weakening trend as the drought magnitude and severity decrease significantly p 0 05 overall the sm drought over southeastern asia aggravated in cold season winter and spring but alleviated in warm season summer and autumn to explore the causes behind the corresponding changes of sm closely related hydrological variable i e precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and evapotranspiration et in each season are investigated fig 6 in winter both precipitation and pet exhibit none significant p 0 05 trend while et show significant p 0 05 increasing trend the drying trend of sm might be impacted by the increasing pet and et as the increasing capacity of et would extract more moisture from soil and aggravate the sm drought in spring the precipitation displays slight decreasing trend while the pet and et increase significantly p 0 05 the significant drying trend of sm should probably be jointly influenced by the decreasing precipitation and the increasing pet as et is increased significantly in this case in summer and autumn the precipitation presents slight increasing trend while the pet and et increase significantly p 0 05 the wetting trend of sm might be related to the increasing precipitation although the increasing trend of precipitation is not significant it is much larger than et in the magnitude during warm season see figure s4 4 3 patterns of soil moisture drought trajectory among total 145 drought events identified in the framework of the 3 d approach 90 droughts lasted more than two months which formed 126 drought cluster trajectories during the drought propagating process in space fig 7 presents the cluster trajectories together with their cumulative 3 smapi value for the drought events started in each season to avoid spurious large changes of the cluster centroid s location due to its splitting or merging the cluster tracking with the largest overlap area between the current and subsequent cluster is accounted besides only the tracks with monthly displacements exceeds 150 km are considered lest that the small displacements might fall within the uncertainty of the cluster centroid s location herrera estrada et al 2017 it can be seen from fig 7 that the cluster tracks and the integrated intensity the cumulative 3 smapi of the events started in winter spring summer and autumn exhibit substantial difference in their spatial patterns for winter droughts i e the drought events started in winter and mostly lasted in winter and spring both northeast and south of the study region are active zone fig 7 a a predominant route of westward can be found in the cluster tracks located in south region it can be supported by the direction statistics in fig 8 a as the westward monthly displacements of the clusters takes up to 34 for winter droughts however for summer droughts i e the droughts started in summer and mostly lasting in summer and autumn the cluster tracks are no longer confined to northeast or southwest region a predominant route of southwest across yangtze river basin formed the cluster tracks toward southwest exceed over 43 of total tracks fig 8 a as for spring droughts the cluster displacements mostly take place in southwest and northeast region while no evident routes or directions are present fig 7 b fig 8 a for autumn droughts the southwest region is the most severe in terms of the integrated intensity any dominant tracking route or direction can hardly be found as the drought cluster tracks scattered in large parts fig 7 d fig 8 a regarding to the drought cluster tracking distance the seasonal statistics show that spring droughts have the shortest cluster trajectory on average while summer droughts usually have longer trajectories fig 8 b 4 4 spatio temporal developing process of individual drought events to have an insight into the development process of an individual drought event the spatio temporal propagating process of a drought is present explicitly in a 3 dimensional form as fig 9 in specific fig 9 shows the drought cluster together with its dynamic monthly displacements of four representative severe events started in winter drought event 200412 200507 spring drought event 199503 199506 summer drought event 198507 198601 and autumn drought event 199611 199706 with different spatial locations moreover the monthly anomaly of two predominant sm controlling factor i e precipitation the dominant sm input and potential evapotranspiration pet the dominant driver of sm output in hydrological cycle are also investigated over the 3 d drought affected area to illustrate the possible causes of sm drought considering the time lag of precipitation and pet on soil moisture drought van loon and van lanen 2012 the precipitation and pet monthly anomaly maps were accounted and observed 3 months earlier before the drought occurrence fig 10 the drought event 200412 200507 started in early winter in south china and migrated westward all the way to northern myanmar over 8 months of duration although during which the drought cluster splitting and merging phenomenon appeared fig 9 a the initial soil moisture drought was driven by persistent negative abnormal precipitation combined with comparatively strong pet capacity meanwhile the continuation of this drought was probably dominated by precipitation as its negative anomaly always existed in the drought area and presented a westward change over time fig 10 a and e the positive pet anomaly aggravated the sm drought condition to a certain extent as it also presented westward changes during the drought propagation process fig 10 e the drought event 199503 199506 started in early spring and did not disappear until midsummer the location of this drought did not change a lot figure s5 the occurrence of sm drought in march was resulted from the comparatively low precipitation since january coupled with the strong pet capacity since february due to crop growing likewise the drought persistence in spring and early summer were under the control of precipitation and pet synergistically as the negative precipitation anomaly distributed over the whole drought area and the positive pet anomaly presented similar patterns with sm drought cluster fig 10 b and f the drought event 198507 198601 started in midsummer in the middle part of yangtze river basin with two sm drought cluster appeared simultaneously in the north and south it travelled to southwest in summer and stranded in southwestern region over 5 months during autumn and winter the formulation and persistence of this drought is mainly driven by precipitation because the negative precipitation anomaly nearly filled the whole 3 d drought space however the impact of pet cannot be ignored particularly for sm droughts located in the middle part of yangtze river basin during summer it seems that the positive pet anomaly in summer contributed the appearance of sm drought while the negative pet anomaly after summer promoted its disappearance fig 10 c and g the drought event 199611 199706 started in late autumn in southwest of yangtze river basin mainly in yunnan province china stranded in southwest of the region over the whole winter and spring and finally disappeared as summer came the drought occurrence firstly in yunnan province should be driven by precipitation and pet as where the two drivers both present anomaly from august to november fig 10 d and h additionally the precipitation and pet monthly anomaly map also indicated that the southwest drought in winter was probably dominated by precipitation anomaly while the drought in spring should largely rely on the pet anomaly this change can be related to the temperature increase and the crop growing in spring overall the above spatio temporal development process of sm droughts and the precipitation and pet in drought space time structure indicated that sm drought propagated synergistically with precipitation and pet precipitation was generally the primary driver and pet the secondary particularly for the drought events lasting in summer and winter in south region nevertheless pet usually enhanced the sm drought condition in spring and summer due to the temperature increasing and the crop growing vigorously 5 discussion 5 1 robustness of the identified predominant route of drought two predominant routes of westward for winter droughts in south region and southwest for summer droughts across yangtze river basin from northeast to southwest of the region are recognized based on the 0 25 0 25 esa cci soil moisture data using smapi on 3 month scale fig 7 a and c for seasonal 3 monthly smapi soil moisture droughts the two predominant drought cluster tracking routes are ubiquitous or just specific for the 0 25 spatial resolution considering the fact that the specific information of soil moisture tends to disappear while the primary one usually remains with the declining of its spatial resolution owing to space averaging the drought tracking characteristics were investigated based on the coarse 0 5 0 5 and 1 0 1 0 spatial data both the 0 5 0 5 and 1 0 1 0 soil moisture data are resampled from the original 0 25 0 25 esa cci dataset using a spatial averaging method fig 11 shows the drought cluster trajectories together with their cumulative 3 smapi for the drought events started in winter and summer for both 0 5 0 5 and 1 0 1 0 cases it can be found that the spatial distribution and direction of the cluster tracks have certain changes among different spatial resolutions both for winter and summer droughts fig 7 a and c fig 11 a and b fig 11 c and d however both the westward predominant route for winter droughts and the southwest route for summer droughts still exists in the cases with lower spatial resolution it is also supported by the direction statistics of the drought cluster tracks fig 12 for winter droughts the westward monthly displacements of clusters are up to 48 and 39 in 0 5 0 5 and 1 0 1 0 cases respectively for summer droughts the cluster tracks toward southwest is 38 in 1 0 1 0 case although it is 22 in 0 5 0 5 case the total of southward southwest and westward is up to 70 overall the existence of the predominant route of westward for winter droughts in south region and southwest route for summer droughts across yangtze river basin should be objective 5 2 reasonability of the predominant route of drought droughts can span over large geographical areas and last for months drought propagation occurs in space and time simultaneously the underlying causes for drought propagation is still unclear as a significant number of physical processes related to atmospheric activity land atmosphere feedback and land surface process are involved in it to date two primary mechanisms of precipitation recycling and moisture transport have been linked to soil moisture drought propagation roy et al 2019 miralles et al 2019 precipitation recycling is from regional moisture recycling perspective mainly refers to the contribution of evapotranspiration et from a region to the precipitation of the same region in drought development eltahir and bras 1996 moisture transport focuses on the horizontal movement of water vapor which is interpreted as a process that drought reduce moisture exports downwind leading to less precipitation and possibly amplify the drought condition downwind in herrera estrada et al 2019 precipitation recycling is from the perspective of the impact of regional internal moisture circulation on drought propagation while moisture transport is from the effect of the decreased increased moisture from upwind to downwind on drought condition actually both the precipitation recycling and moisture transport mechanism are likely to co exist in soil moisture drought propagation in the above two mechanisms soil moisture drought propagation is inseparable with the primary controlling factor of sm i e precipitation prep the dominant sm input and potential evapotranspiration pet the dominant driver of sm output at a certain level pet prep precipitation could reflect the drying capacity potential of sm with the larger value indicates the more likely dryer of sm besides considering that pet affects sm variations through the actual et of the land surface soil and vegetation et should also be accounted as a prerequisite in sm drought propagation exploration hence we try to elaborate the reasonability of the identified predominant routes in our drought cluster tracking by analyzing the monthly variation of pet p and et combing the drought development mechanism of precipitation recycling and moisture transport the westward predominant route in droughts started in winter and lasting in winter half year winter and spring in south of the region can be interpreted as follows in winter and spring the actual et in south especially for southwest is still at relatively high level fig 14 because the temperature generally keeps above 10 centigrade with subtropical climate and both the vegetation growing and soil water bodies evaporation needs plenty of water supply under this condition the low abnormal prep combined with relatively high capacity of et pet tends to cause sm drought in terms of drought propagation the westward route in south is probably related to the expansion of the high drying capacity of sm i e high pet prep in space over time the black box fig 13 the westward expansion of dryness is likely related to the following two factors one is the prevailing easterly winds in winter mainly for dec and jan in eastern part of the south region and its upwind area the red box figure s6 the easterly winds would drive dry atmosphere westward and amplify the drought condition downwind as it is opposite to the general moisture transport direction of eastward ding et al 2018 wang and lin 2002 the other is the westerly and southwesterly winds in later winter and spring in south of the region the blue box figure s6 the prevailing westerly winds tend to drive moist atmosphere eastward and relieve the drought condition downwind as it is consistent with the general moisture transport direction of eastward fang et al 2013 ding et al 2018 besides it should be noteworthy that in north region sm droughts cannot be indicated by the substantially high pet prep in winter half year it is because the actual et is comparatively low there fig 14 dec to mar due to the limited evaporation from soil water bodies and the very little transpiration from the stagnant growth of vegetation subjected to the persistent low temperature subzero in general in winter and early spring correspondingly the southwest predominant route in droughts started in summer and lasting in summer half year summer and autumn across yangtze river basin can be illustrated below with the coming of summer the evaporation from soil water bodies increases and the plant grows vigorously and demands large amounts of water for transpiration over most of the region fig 14 the pet is usually high while the prep is often unevenly distributed in space and time caused by the seasonal northward advance and southward retreat of the rain belt ding and chan 2005 this contradiction between water demand and supply increases the probability of drought the monthly climatology shows that the low drying capacity of sm i e the low pet prep expands toward northeast and northwest the magenta box fig 13 which is largely impacted by the water vapor transport via the southwest monsoon from indian ocean and the southeast monsoon from pacific ocean jun to nov figure s6 based on the moisture transport mechanism the drought should propagate to the opposite direction i e southwest southeast with the low pet prep i e high level of moisture expansion probably because the drought over northeast southwest of the region is mainly impacted by the water vapor transport from southwest in summer half year the sm drought propagation presents a southwest predominant tracking route 6 conclusion to deepen the understanding of drought propagation in multiple dimensions for further drought mechanism exploration and effective drought prediction the soil moisture droughts in a hotspot region of southeastern asia were investigated based on a 3 dimensional latitude longitude and time drought identification approach with a merged dataset of remote sensing and land surface modeling over 1979 2016 the results demonstrated that i a total of 369 drought clusters and 145 drought events were identified based on 3 smapi spatially severe droughts mainly distributed in southwest and northeast of the study region the sm drought was more serious in cold season winter and spring than that in warm season summer and autumn in terms of the frequency area and severity of the drought cluster ii although the sm drought for the whole region did not show any distinct trend on an inter annual scale it presented significant p 0 05 trend on seasonal scale the drought in warm season alleviated but that in cold season aggravated prominently thus it would pose more challenges for future drought mitigation in cold season especially for spring with crop growing vigorously iii in drought cluster tracking two predominant routes of westward and southwest were recognized the westward route was shared by the droughts started in winter and lasted mainly in winter half year in south region while the southwest route was shared by the droughts started in summer and lasted mainly in summer half year across yangtze river basin from northeast to southwest of the region iv at an event level sm drought propagated synergistically with precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet generally precipitation was the primary driver and pet the secondary particularly for the droughts lasting in summer and winter in south region nevertheless the driving power of pet usually enhanced in spring and summer with the temperature increasing and the crop growing vigorously overall the current work gave a comprehensive investigation on the spatio temporal dynamics and characteristics of soil moisture droughts in a global hotspot region of southeastern asia with typical monsoon climate the existence of the predominant drought tracking route for seasonal sm droughts was largely confirmed based on the categorical analysis of season timing of drought the innovative drought tracking analysis could serve as important implications for investigation on drought migration patterns of other hotspot regions with monsoon climate the dynamics of sm droughts in the 3 d drought domain was interpreted in consideration of the dominant sm input precipitation and output pet the findings in drought propagation is the foundation to understand the driver on drought development which would also provide essential spatio temporal structure for further drought mechanism exploration and important clues for future drought prediction credit authorship contribution statement yongwei liu conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding

introduction baseflow comprises a combination of deep regional groundwater shallow riparian groundwater interflow soil water and bank return flows that sustains rivers between high flow events when surface runoff is limited documenting the sources locations and fluxes of baseflow to rivers and streams is critical to our understanding of hydrological processes and for protecting and managing surface water resources winter 1999 2007 cook 2013 harvey and gooseff 2015 where baseflow includes a significant component of regional groundwater streamflows may decline due to groundwater extraction mccallum et al 2012 impacting the health of riverine ecosystems groundwater may also transport contaminants to rivers sanford et al 2011 miller et al 2016 2017 husic et al 2019 knowledge of the relative contribution of baseflow to streamflow is also required to assess the potential impacts of climate change and for flood forecasting the location and flux of baseflow can be determined from changes in river geochemistry yu and schwartz 1999 brodie et al 2007 cook 2013 major ions stable isotopes and radioactive isotopes especially 222rn also allow contributions from the different components of baseflow to be estimated via chemical mass balance camacho suarez et al 2015 cartwright et al 2018 however the difficulty of in situ analysis and costs generally preclude their use for anything other than short term studies by contrast specific conductivity sc which is an indication of the concentration of all charged ions may be measured by relatively inexpensive loggers at similar time intervals to those over which river flow is measured gonzales et al 2009 sanford et al 2011 cartwright et al 2014 miller et al 2014 the use of sc as a tracer of baseflow requires that it behaves conservatively i e instream biogeochemical reactions do not change sc values while that may be a concern for low salinity streams where bicarbonate is the dominant anion it is less of an issue for more saline streams where cl is the major anion and sc values can often be robustly correlated with cl concentrations e g cartwright et al 2014 because it is a general indicator of water quality government agencies commonly measure sc values continuously as part of river monitoring programs e g department of environment land water and planning 2020 united states geological survey 2020 while sc does not necessarily allow the various components of baseflow to be distinguished it can be used to estimate net baseflow inputs over multiyear timescales the two component hydrograph separation assumes that there are two components of streamflow baseflow and surface water or quickflow that have significantly different tracer concentrations understanding the sc of the baseflow component is therefore fundamental however because baseflow may comprise a variety of water stores its sc may be temporally variable gonzales et al 2009 sanford et al 2011 cartwright et al 2014 miller et al 2014 rumsey et al 2017 in particular water stores such as bank return flows and interflow may have sc values similar to surface runoff if that is the case the sc mass balance may estimate the saline groundwater inputs rather than the total baseflow mccallum et al 2010 cartwright et al 2014 cartwright and irvine 2020 furthermore if groundwater salinity is spatially heterogeneous the average sc of the groundwater discharging to the river may change with the relative elevations of the water table and river the spatial and temporal variability of baseflow sc potentially complicates mass balance studies particularly in larger catchments however this approach has been used to estimate baseflow inflows in catchments with areas of several thousand square kilometres e g sanford et al 2011 rumsey et al 2017 in addition the sc of surface runoff may not be well defined or may be variable e g following first flushes where early season rains dissolve solutes from the soils or land surface rumsey et al 2017 the sc value of the baseflow component may be based on measured sc values of groundwater from wells adjacent to the river e g brodie et al 2007 cook 2013 alternatively if the sc of groundwater is spatially variable and or measurements of near river groundwater are sparse baseflow sc may be assigned as the sc of the river during low flows since it is assumed that rivers at those times are entirely sustained by baseflow gonzales et al 2009 cartwright et al 2014 miller et al 2014 the sc of baseflow may vary year to year and some studies have estimated daily values by interpolating between the maximum sc values in successive years miller et al 2014 rumsey et al 2017 raffensperger et al 2017 hydrograph separations based on geochemical tracers including sc estimate

and scb while the scs term is commonly conceived of as representing relatively rapid direct rainfall inflows e g overland flows it may also comprise delayed components of low sc water such as interflow and bank storage mccallum et al 2010 cartwright et al 2014 a value of scs of 50 μs cm 1 was adopted for the australian catchments which corresponds to approximately the lowest sc of stream water recorded at high streamflows in these catchments a value of scs of 33 μs cm 1 was used for the colorado catchments as this was the average in stream sc at two high elevation stream sites during peak snowmelt miller et al 2014 daily scb values were estimated by interpolating between the 99th percentile of sci in successive water years which accounts for the variations in scb over time miller et al 2014 using the 99th percentile avoids the influence of outliers e g high sc values caused by flushing of solutes after prolonged dry spells this method of calculating scb results in xi occasionally exceeding 1 5 of days these values of xi were set to 1 the water year for the australian sites was designated as commencing on july 1 i e at the start of winter and on october 1 for the colorado catchments because xi does not depend on xi 1 no attempt was made to infill missing sc data but only years where both sc and flow including zero flows were recorded on 85 of the days are reported table 1 4 results the sc values in the australian catchments are inversely correlated with streamflow e g fig 1 however the there is a commonly a poor correlation of sci values between adjacent gauges in the barwon catchment the r2 of sci values between adjacent gauges are 0 32 to 0 57 fig 2b by contrast daily discharge values between the pairs of gauges are well correlated r2 0 83 to 0 90 fig 2a accounting for the minor saline inflows from birregurra creek on the sc values at kildean via mass balance makes no substantial difference to the correlation in sci between ricketts marsh and kildean in the campaspe catchment the correlation of sci values between rochester and echuca is poor r2 0 11 fig 2d while streamflow is well correlated r2 0 76 sci values between fulham bridge and harrow and harrow and burkes bridge in the glenelg catchment are better correlated r2 0 82 for both pairs of gauges fig 2f than in either the upper barwon or campaspe catchments sc values in the upper colorado river basin are also inversely correlated with streamflow miller et al 2014 here too the correlation of daily streamflow between gun1 and gun2 is higher r2 0 84 fig 2g than the sci values r2 0 53 fig 2h it is difficult to account for the inflows from ungauged minor tributaries and comparison of daily sc values in winter is complicated by the potential activation of ephemeral tributaries between the monitoring stations however as illustrated by fig s2 there are no significant differences between the correlations recorded during different seasons notably sci values during the dry summer months when the ephemeral tributaries are invariably dry are still poorly correlated the comparison of daily sc values may be complicated by the propagation of flood waves along the rivers data from the department of environment land water and planning 2020 suggests that high flow episodes may take up to two days to travel between the adjacent gauges on the australian rivers shifting the comparison date for the sci values of the downstream gauge by one to two days however does not affect the results in any season despite the generally poor correlation in sci values there are systematic longer term variations in sc values between adjacent gauges fig 3 this is illustrated for single years for ricketts marsh and kildean in the barwon catchment fig 3a fulham bridge and harrow in the glenelg catchment fig 3b and gunnison 1 and gunnison 2 in the upper colorado river basin fig 3c using arbitrary averaging periods of 1 to 45 days the sci values define several hysteresis loops implying that the sci values at the pairs of gauges increase and decrease at different times the correlations improve as the averaging window length is extended partially due to the removal of outlier values in the daily data the hysteresis loops are also clearer in the averaged sc values to assess whether there is a seasonal influence the data from the australian catchments were split into autumn winter and spring summer periods and the colorado catchment into snowmelt april to june and non snowmelt periods the hysteresis loops are apparent all periods in the australian catchments however they are not as prominent in the snowmelt period in the colorado catchment to better highlight the hysteresis loops a moving 45 day average was applied to all the sc data fig 4 the refined hysteresis loops illustrate that the sc values commonly have different trends in different years despite the good overall correlation between sci values in the glenelg catchment fig 2f correlations in any individual year are relatively poor fig 3c the daily variability defined as sci sci 1 1 of sci values are up to 507 table 1 these higher values represent days when sc increases rapidly due to first flushes or decreases rapidly during high streamflows following major rain events however the average daily variability of between 3 0 and 6 5 implies that the day to day variations in sc are relatively moderate this is also apparent for the barwon river from in fig 1b over individual flow events in the australian catchments the sc on the rising limb of the hydrograph is higher than on the falling limb fig 3d e such that the sc vs q defines clockwise hysteresis loops by contrast the upper colorado catchment does not display such strong sc vs q hysteresis patterns fig 3f 5 discussion and conclusions the hysteresis loops in sc values between adjacent gauges and the relatively smooth day to day variations in sc at individual gauges are best explained by the water sources sustaining streamflow in individual river reaches varying systematically over time in detail groundwater river interactions may be complex the flux of groundwater into a river will vary as the relative elevations of the river and water table change given that groundwater and surface water elevations respond on different timescales to rainfall e g duvert et al 2015 the contribution of groundwater from different parts of a catchment to streamflow may vary over time if groundwater salinity is spatially variable the net sc of the groundwater inflows within a river reach may vary significantly over time even annual baseflow estimates calculated using eq 1 between the nearest pairs of gauges in the australian catchments are not always well correlated r2 0 42 to 0 80 table 1 the rivers are sufficiently saline that uncertainties arising from errors in scs are not significant e g varying scs between 20 and 200 μs cm 1 results in uncertainties of 5 adopting different values of scb e g using a uniform value for each water year cartwright et al 2014 results in a similar uncertainty additionally these uncertainties are unlikely to explain the differences in baseflow estimates between adjacent gauges on the same river the average baseflow calculated for all years varies within a smaller range table 1 and has some coherent patterns e g a downstream decrease in the percentage of baseflow in the barwon catchment bank return flows interflow input of soil water or draining of pools on floodplains may also contribute water with variable geochemistry to rivers and complicate the two component mass balance calculations in particular bank return flows are common in many rivers and may have relatively low sc values squillace 1996 mccallum et al 2010 cartwright et al 2014 cartwright and irvine 2020 previous studies suggest that the geochemistry of the barwon river is influenced by bank return flows cartwright et al 2014 howcroft et al 2019 and the sc vs q hysteresis loops in the australian catchments fig 3d e are consistent with delayed inflows of low salinity water to the rivers following high flow events e g evans and davies 1998 by contrast the upper colorado river does not show well defined sc vs q hysteresis loops this may reflect a lower importance of bank storage and or the lower contrast between the ec of baseflow and surface runoff and would explain the better correlation between daily sc values in this catchment the volume of water stored in the river banks and the timescales over which bank return flows occur vary with hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer sediments regional head gradients the duration and magnitude of the high flow events and the frequency of high flow events e g squillace 1996 mccallum et al 2010 cartwright and irvine 2020 these multiple controls mean that bank return flows are likely to be spatially and temporally variable and rivers may receive an input of bank return waters for several weeks to months which would explain the poor correlation of sc values during both low and high flow periods both explanations envisage that the river reaches are fed by different stores of water that vary in importance over time if these packets of water have different sc values or if their sc values change over time they would produce the sc vs sc and q vs sc hysteresis loops observed in fig 3 because the interaction between river water groundwater and water from the intermediate stores is complex it may result in different relationships in the sc between adjacent gauges in different years fig 4 utilising sc values to estimate baseflow requires that processes that cause it to vary in rivers are well understood strategies for estimating scb and scs understanding whether in river processes change sc values and other uncertainties e g in measured streamflows have been discussed elsewhere e g gonzales et al 2009 sanford et al 2011 cook 2013 cartwright et al 2014 miller et al 2014 camacho suarez et al 2015 rumsey et al 2017 yang et al 2019 trends in sc values between adjacent gauges can be used to assess over what timescales comparisons of baseflow inputs may be made the variability of the annual estimates of baseflow in the australian catchments table 1 implies that comparing baseflow even over that timescale which is commonly how that technique is applied may be subject to uncertainties the poor correlation of sc values in all seasons fig s2 implies that comparison of baseflow at specific flow conditions even during low summer flows is also unlikely to be viable the different sc trends at adjacent gauges could indicate where bank return flows are more important and where consideration of more than two flow components is warranted for example the very poor correlation of even the smoothed sc values in the campaspe catchment may indicate temporal variability in source inputs alternatively if the variable sc patterns are the result of regional groundwater with variable salinity interacting with the river it further complicates the estimate of scb at sites with stronger correlations between sc at adjacent gages such as the glenelg and gunnison rivers sc based two component hydrographs separation may be more appropriate there is a need to better conceptualise and quantify the water sources that contribute to rivers while the simple distinction between groundwater and surface water is known to be over simplistic little is known about the intermediate stores of water bank return flows interflow and soil water that commonly contribute to streamflow in particular bank return flows may contribute to streamflow for many months to years mccallum et al 2010 the reach scale sc comparisons described here are suggested as being useful for identifying times and or locations where consideration of more than two flow components of streamflow is warranted integrating detailed geochemistry or groundwater elevation studies that can better define water sources with longer term sc and streamflow datasets would be valuable in improving understanding of flow contributions from intermediate stores credit authorship contribution statement ian cartwright

introduction baseflow comprises a combination of deep regional groundwater shallow riparian groundwater interflow soil water and bank return flows that sustains rivers between high flow events when surface runoff is limited documenting the sources locations and fluxes of baseflow to rivers and streams is critical to our understanding of hydrological processes and for protecting and managing surface water resources winter 1999 2007 cook 2013 harvey and gooseff 2015 where baseflow includes a significant component of regional groundwater streamflows may decline due to groundwater extraction

relative contribution of baseflow to streamflow is also required to assess the potential impacts of climate change and for flood forecasting the location and flux of baseflow can be determined from changes in river geochemistry yu and schwartz 1999 brodie et al 2007 cook 2013 major ions stable isotopes and radioactive isotopes especially 222rn also allow contributions from the different components of baseflow to be estimated via chemical mass balance camacho suarez et al 2015 cartwright et al 2018 however the difficulty of in situ analysis and costs generally preclude their use for anything other than short term studies by contrast specific conductivity sc which is an indication of the concentration of all charged ions may be measured by relatively inexpensive loggers at similar time intervals to those over which river flow is measured gonzales et al 2009 sanford et al 2011 cartwright et al 2014 miller et al 2014 the use of sc as a tracer of baseflow requires that it behaves conservatively i e instream biogeochemical reactions do not change sc values while that may be a concern for low salinity streams where bicarbonate is the dominant anion it is less of an issue for more saline streams where cl is the major anion and sc values can often be robustly correlated with cl concentrations e g cartwright et al 2014 because it is a general indicator of water quality government agencies commonly measure sc values continuously as part of river monitoring programs e g department of environment land water and planning 2020 united states geological survey 2020 while sc does not necessarily allow the various components of baseflow to be distinguished it can be used to estimate net baseflow inputs over multiyear timescales the two component hydrograph separation assumes that there are two components of streamflow baseflow and surface water or quickflow that have significantly different tracer concentrations understanding the sc of the baseflow component is therefore fundamental however because baseflow may comprise a variety of water stores its sc may be temporally variable gonzales et al 2009 sanford et al 2011 cartwright et al 2014 miller et al 2014 rumsey et al 2017 in particular water stores such as bank return flows and interflow may have sc values similar to surface runoff if that is the case the sc mass balance may estimate the saline groundwater inputs rather than the total baseflow mccallum et al 2010 cartwright et al 2014 cartwright and irvine 2020 furthermore if groundwater salinity is spatially heterogeneous the average sc of the groundwater discharging to the river may change with the relative elevations of the water table and river the spatial and temporal variability of baseflow sc potentially complicates mass balance studies particularly in larger catchments however this approach has been used to estimate baseflow inflows in catchments with areas of several thousand square kilometres e g sanford et al 2011 rumsey et al 2017 in addition the sc of surface runoff may not be well defined or may be variable e g following first flushes where early season rains dissolve solutes from the soils or land surface rumsey et al 2017 the sc value of the baseflow component may be based on measured sc values of groundwater from wells adjacent to the river e g brodie et al 2007 cook 2013 alternatively if the sc of groundwater is spatially variable and or measurements of near river groundwater are sparse baseflow sc may be assigned as the sc of the river during low flows since it is assumed that rivers at those times are entirely sustained by baseflow gonzales et al 2009 cartwright et al 2014 miller et al 2014 the sc of baseflow may vary year to year and some studies have estimated daily values by

interflow and bank storage mccallum et al 2010 cartwright et al 2014 a value of scs of 50 μs cm 1 was adopted for the australian catchments which corresponds to approximately the lowest sc of stream water recorded at high streamflows in these catchments a value of scs of 33 μs cm 1 was used for the colorado catchments as this was the average in stream sc at two high elevation stream sites during peak snowmelt miller et al 2014 daily scb values were estimated by interpolating between the 99th percentile of sci in successive water years which accounts for the variations in scb over time miller et al 2014 using the 99th percentile avoids the influence of outliers e g high sc values caused by flushing of solutes after prolonged dry spells this method of calculating scb results in xi occasionally exceeding 1 5 of days these values of xi were set to 1 the water year for the australian sites was designated as commencing on july 1 i e at the start of winter and on october 1 for the colorado catchments because xi does not depend on xi 1 no attempt was made to infill missing sc data but only years where both sc and flow including zero flows were recorded on 85 of the days are reported table 1 4 results the sc values in the australian catchments are inversely correlated with streamflow e g fig 1 however the there is a commonly a poor correlation of sci values between adjacent gauges in the barwon catchment the r2 of sci values between adjacent gauges are 0 32 to 0 57 fig 2b by contrast daily discharge values between the pairs of gauges are well correlated r2 0 83 to 0 90 fig 2a accounting for the minor saline inflows from birregurra creek on the sc values at kildean via mass balance makes no substantial difference to the correlation in sci between ricketts marsh and kildean in the campaspe catchment the correlation of sci values between rochester and echuca is poor r2 0 11 fig 2d while streamflow is well correlated r2 0 76 sci values between fulham bridge and harrow and harrow and burkes bridge in the glenelg catchment are better correlated r2 0 82 for both pairs of gauges fig 2f than in either the upper barwon or campaspe catchments sc values in the upper colorado river basin are also inversely correlated with streamflow miller et al 2014 here too the correlation of daily streamflow between gun1 and gun2 is higher r2 0 84 fig 2g than the sci values r2 0 53 fig 2h it is difficult to account for the inflows from ungauged minor tributaries and comparison of daily sc values in winter is complicated by the potential activation of ephemeral tributaries between the monitoring stations however as illustrated by fig s2 there are no significant differences between the correlations recorded during different seasons notably sci values during the dry summer months when the ephemeral tributaries are invariably dry are still poorly correlated the comparison of daily sc values may be complicated by the propagation of flood waves along the rivers data from the department of environment land water and planning 2020 suggests that high flow episodes may take up to two days to travel between the adjacent gauges on the australian rivers shifting the comparison date for the sci values of the downstream gauge by one to two days however does not affect the results in any season despite the generally poor correlation in sci values there are systematic longer term variations in sc values between adjacent gauges fig 3 this is illustrated for single years for ricketts marsh and kildean in the barwon catchment fig 3a fulham bridge and harrow in the glenelg catchment fig 3b and gunnison 1 and gunnison 2 in the upper colorado river basin fig 3c using arbitrary averaging periods of 1 to 45 days the sci values define several hysteresis loops implying that the sci values at the pairs of gauges increase and decrease at different times the correlations improve as the averaging window length is extended partially due to the removal of outlier values in the daily data the hysteresis loops are also clearer in the averaged sc values to assess whether there is a seasonal influence the data from the australian catchments were split into autumn winter and spring summer periods and the colorado catchment into snowmelt april to june and non snowmelt periods the hysteresis loops are apparent all periods in the australian catchments however they are not as prominent in the snowmelt period in the colorado catchment to better highlight the hysteresis loops a moving 45 day average was applied to all the sc data fig 4 the refined hysteresis loops illustrate that the sc values commonly have different trends in different years despite the good overall correlation between sci values in the glenelg catchment fig 2f correlations in any individual year are relatively poor fig 3c the daily variability defined as sci sci 1 1 of sci values are up to 507 table 1 these higher values represent days when sc increases rapidly due to first flushes or decreases rapidly during high streamflows following major rain events however the average daily variability of between 3 0 and 6 5 implies that the day to day variations in sc are relatively moderate this is also apparent for the barwon river from in fig 1b over individual flow events in the australian catchments the sc on the rising limb of the hydrograph is higher than on the falling limb fig 3d e such that the sc vs q defines clockwise hysteresis loops by contrast the upper colorado catchment does not display such strong sc vs q hysteresis patterns fig 3f 5 discussion and conclusions the hysteresis loops in sc values between adjacent gauges and the relatively smooth day to day variations in sc at individual gauges are best explained by the water sources sustaining streamflow in individual river reaches varying systematically over time in detail groundwater river interactions may be complex the flux of groundwater into a river will vary as the relative elevations of the river and water table change given that groundwater and surface water elevations respond on different timescales to rainfall e g duvert et al 2015 the contribution of groundwater from different parts of a catchment to streamflow may vary over time if groundwater salinity is spatially variable the net sc of the groundwater inflows within a river reach may vary significantly over time even annual baseflow estimates calculated using eq 1 between the nearest pairs of gauges in the australian catchments are not always well correlated r2 0 42 to 0 80 table 1 the rivers are sufficiently saline that uncertainties arising from errors in scs are not significant e g varying scs between 20 and 200 μs cm 1 results in uncertainties of 5 adopting different values of scb e g using a uniform value for each water year cartwright et al 2014 results in a similar uncertainty additionally these uncertainties are unlikely to explain the differences in baseflow estimates between adjacent gauges on the same river the average baseflow calculated for all years varies within a smaller range table 1 and has some coherent patterns e g a downstream decrease in the percentage of baseflow in the barwon catchment bank return flows interflow input of soil water or draining of pools on floodplains may also contribute water with variable geochemistry to rivers and complicate the two component mass balance calculations in particular bank return flows are common in many rivers and may have relatively low sc values squillace 1996 mccallum et al 2010 cartwright et al 2014 cartwright and irvine 2020 previous studies suggest that the geochemistry of the barwon river is influenced by bank return flows cartwright et al 2014 howcroft et al 2019 and the sc vs q hysteresis loops in the australian catchments fig 3d e are consistent with delayed inflows of low salinity water to the rivers following high flow events e g evans and davies 1998 by contrast the upper colorado river does not show well defined sc vs q hysteresis loops this may reflect a lower importance of bank storage and or the lower contrast between the ec of baseflow and surface runoff and would explain the better correlation between daily sc values in this catchment the volume of water stored in the river banks and the timescales over which bank return flows occur vary with hydraulic conductivities of the aquifer sediments regional head gradients the duration and magnitude of the high flow events and the frequency of high flow events e g squillace 1996 mccallum et al 2010 cartwright and irvine 2020 these multiple controls mean that bank return flows are likely to be spatially and temporally variable and rivers may receive an input of bank return waters for several weeks to months which would explain the poor correlation of sc values during both low and high flow periods both explanations envisage that the river reaches are fed by different stores of water that vary in importance over time if these packets of water have different sc values or if their sc values change over time they would produce the sc vs sc and q vs sc hysteresis loops observed in fig 3 because the interaction between river water groundwater and water from the intermediate stores is complex it may result in different relationships in the sc between adjacent gauges in different years fig 4 utilising sc values to estimate baseflow requires that processes that cause it to vary in rivers are well understood strategies for estimating scb and scs understanding whether in river processes change sc values and other uncertainties e g in measured streamflows have been discussed elsewhere e g gonzales et al 2009 sanford et al 2011 cook 2013 cartwright et al 2014 miller et al 2014 camacho suarez et al 2015 rumsey et al 2017 yang et al 2019 trends in sc values between adjacent gauges can be used to assess over what timescales comparisons of baseflow inputs may be made the variability of the annual estimates of baseflow in the australian catchments table 1 implies that comparing baseflow even over that timescale which is commonly how that technique is applied may be subject to uncertainties the poor correlation of sc values in all seasons fig s2 implies that comparison of baseflow at specific flow conditions even during low summer flows is also unlikely to be viable the different sc trends at adjacent gauges could indicate where bank return flows are more important and where consideration of more than two flow components is warranted for example the very poor correlation of even the smoothed sc values in the campaspe catchment may indicate temporal variability in source inputs alternatively if the variable sc patterns are the result of regional groundwater with variable salinity interacting with the river it further complicates the estimate of scb at sites with stronger correlations between sc at adjacent gages such as the glenelg and gunnison rivers sc based two component hydrographs separation may be more appropriate there is a need to better conceptualise and quantify the water sources that contribute to rivers while the simple distinction between groundwater and surface water is known to be over simplistic little is known about the intermediate stores of water bank return flows interflow and soil water that commonly contribute to streamflow in particular bank return flows may contribute to streamflow for many months to years mccallum et al 2010 the reach scale sc comparisons described here are suggested as being useful for identifying times and or locations where consideration of more than two flow components of streamflow is warranted integrating detailed geochemistry or groundwater elevation studies that can better define water sources with longer term sc and streamflow datasets would be valuable in improving understanding of flow contributions from intermediate stores credit authorship contribution statement ian cartwright
