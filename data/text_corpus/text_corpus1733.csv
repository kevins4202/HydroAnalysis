8665,large water demands by the mining industry are of increasing concern around the world the cost of a specific water management regulation is studied for an oil sands mining operation in canada where restrictions on water withdrawals vary with fluctuations in the river a stochastic optimal control problem is formulated for a firm choosing production water use and the timing to build a water storage facility under conditions of uncertain oil prices and uncertain water withdrawal limits as no closed form solution is available a stochastic dynamic programming approach is implemented to determine the difference in value and optimal controls for the oil producing asset with and without water restrictions the cost of the restrictions is estimated to be quite small given historical river flow conditions while cost is shown to increase under drier conditions a long run marginal cost curve is developed showing the cost of increasing restrictions given expectations about future

introduction the management of scarce water supplies is an issue of increasing concern in many areas of the world and is exacerbated by uncertainty surrounding the impacts of a warming planet on water availability the resource extraction industry is responsible for large withdrawals of water and competition for water supplies may put industry operations into conflict with local communities these conflicts arise when water demands for resource extraction encroach on the water supplies available for other human activities or compromise aquatic ecosystems protection of the public interest requires that governments around the world specify limits on water withdrawals and enforce legal and regulatory requirements regarding water access rights media and industry reports make it clear that competition for water supplies is of increasing concern for firms involved in resource extraction water availability has been reported as being one of the biggest problems facing mining firms today 2 2 see for example a july 27 2014 financial times article water scarcity and rising energy costs threaten mining industry a moody s investor service report global mining industry water scarcity could increase rating pressure on global mining companies february 14 2013 and 1 similar concerns have been raised regarding shale gas development 3 3 see discussions in 2 and 3 regulatory responses vary across jurisdictions depending on the state of water supplies the nature of other competing uses as well as the existing political legal and regulatory frameworks thomashausen et al 4 review the legal framework regulating water use for gold and copper mining in eight different countries all countries surveyed required mining firms to obtain water licenses or permits as well as undertake some sort of environmental assessment the basis for allocating water shares varies and is typically some combination of riparian or prior appropriation rights as well as rules about the transfer or trading of water rights in theory a social planner would impose the efficient limits on water withdrawals which balance the benefit of maintaining particular water levels in a water source with the cost of those restrictions to current and anticipated future water users in practice regulators charged with restricting water withdrawals to protect surrounding ecosystems face a difficult balancing act especially if proposed water regulations are viewed as a threat by existing water users determining the benefits and costs of water limitations can be problematic particularly when the impact of large water withdrawals on ecosystems are not well understood and require additional scientific study the impact of water restrictions on large industrial water users depends on the future path of key variables including the impacts of a changing climate on water availability prospects for water conserving technologies and the market demand for the industry s output failure to understand the costs of water regulations to large water users increases the likelihood that water restrictions will be set at an inappropriate level and may represent a missed opportunity to improve ecosystem protection at a low cost alternatively a determination that restrictions are very costly to firms points to the need for a process to respond appropriately to ameliorate those costs in this paper we argue that considerable insight into the costs of water restrictions can be gained by modeling a firm s decision making as a stochastic optimal control problem this approach allows for the explicit modeling of key uncertain variables and the different options facing the firm in choosing its responses our study undertakes a systematic analysis of the cost of water regulations imposed on a particular resource extraction activity mining of the oil sands in alberta canada this case is of interest as it manifests several important features commonly arising in cases of industrial water regulation in particular the severity of imposed regulations varies with a particular environmental indicator which will change over time in response to changing weather and climate conditions second profitability of the industry and hence the cost of restrictions depends on volatile market conditions third firms can reduce the cost of regulations by making capital investments such as in water storage facilities the specific contribution of this paper is to demonstrate a rigorous approach using stochastic dynamic programming to examining the cost of environmental regulations for a firm this amounts to use of a provably convergent numerical technique 4 4 the numerical convergence of this stochastic dynamic approach to a meaningful solution is described in 5 for finance applications which illuminates the impact of regulations on the profit maximizing decisions of a typical oil sands firm innovative features of the model include uncertain regulatory limits on water withdrawals and the option to invest in water storage technology water demands by the firm are determined by optimal decisions about oil production given available oil reserves and the terms of a license agreement with the government oil production and hence water use is affected by volatile oil prices determined in world markets a numerical example is presented based on available data for oil sands production technology and costs with oil prices described by a stochastic differential equation and water restrictions modeled as a poisson process the model allows us to examine several important phenomena including the marginal cost of stricter water regulations the impact of regulations on optimal decisions such as when to install storage and when to abandon the project and the impact of uncertain oil prices and water levels on a firm s behavior to the best of our knowledge no previous literature examines the cost of restrictions in this rigorous fashion this paper contributes to the literature on optimal natural resource use under uncertainty as exemplified by papers such as 6 10 and 11 similar to 10 and 11 the firm s decision problem is specified by a hamilton jacobi bellman hjb equation which is solved using a numerical method as there is no closed form solution the paper extends the analysis in previous papers by including an uncertain regulatory constraint resulting from natural variability in the environment it also contributes to the environmental economics literature addressing water issues specifically a paper with a similar motivation is 12 which examines the efficiency of alberta s water regulations for the oil sands using a deterministic model their focus is the efficiency of the protocol for water sharing among firms as a preview some key highlights of the paper are summarized below a long run marginal cost curve is derived showing the impact of tightening water restrictions the shape of the curve is non monotonic due to the lumpy discrete nature of storage investments alberta s regulations on water withdrawals from the lower athabasca river 13 impose only a very small cost on the hypothetical oil sands firm analyzed in this paper costs to the firm only become significant when future river conditions are drier than in the past decade and regulations are stricter this finding implies that current regulations could be made stricter at a relatively low cost oil price volatility affects the decision to invest in water storage facilities in an interesting way depending on the extent to which water limitations are binding when water withdrawals are highly restricted an increase in price volatility makes the investment in storage more likely i e the critical oil price for investment is reduced in contrast when water restrictions are not binding an increase in oil price volatility makes it optimal to delay investment in water storage the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 provides background information related to the oil sands industry and alberta s water use regulations sections 3 and 4 develop a model for the stochastic optimal control problem section 5 describes the determination of parameter values in the model section 6 elaborates on the results section 7 summarizes the conclusions 2 regulation of water use in the alberta oil sands open pit oil sands mining depends heavily on fresh water as an input in contrast to in situ projects which are able to use both saline and fresh water 5 5 kuwayama et al 14 provide an overview of water resource used for the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels up to date data is available from the alberta energy regulator the large ramping up in the scale of oil sands activity in the early 2000s brought public attention to the quantity of both surface and groundwater withdrawals as well as many other environmental impacts that have been well documented in the literature 6 6 see 15 17 and 18 for details moreover in the early to mid 2000s forecasts pointed to ongoing increases in oil sands production which resulted in significant concerns being expressed about the impacts of water withdrawals on the aquatic ecosystem 19 26 combined with the conclusions drawn by some scholars 17 24 27 31 that there is a declining trend of the river flow in the athabasca catchment public alarm about impacts on the aquatic ecosystem was unsurprising according to 32 in the lower athabasca river the collective withdrawals constitute only a tiny percentage of the river flow less than 0 6 of average total river flows and about 3 of the lowest weekly winter flows however since the river flows vary significantly between seasons while oil sands production has less seasonal variation in water short seasons there are risks that the withdrawals will exceed the sustainable level and damage aquatic habitat note there is considerable scientific uncertainty over how much water can be safely diverted from the river without harming the aquatic ecosystem 7 7 see for example a ctv news report from march 19 2014 alberta s plan for athabasca river pathetic not science based critics by bob weber the canadian press this article quotes david schindler a university of alberta ecologist who claims a lack of scientific evidence for the chosen water restrictions and argues that even a couple of inches less in the river can have a critical impact on fish habitat bug populations water quality ground water etc in addition the river sustains the livelihood and culture of first nations and metis communities in the area and low flow hinders navigation on the river the peace athabasca delta is a landscape of great ecological significance located within one of canada s 15 unesco world heritage sites its ecosystem is heavily dependent on the river flow level of the athabasca river 27 in response to these concerns the alberta government drafted a river management plan for the lower athabasca river to limit withdrawals according to river conditions the management plan was first imposed in 2007 and is described in the phase 1 framework 13 this phase 1 framework was intended to address immediate needs for water protection based on available evidence in 2007 with the intention that the regulations would be revised in future based on the results of further research additional research and consultation with stakeholders were carried out over the subsequent seven years resulting in a revision to the water regulations released in 2015 as the phase 2 framework 33 the phase 2 regulations imposed a somewhat finer classification of water flow conditions but are otherwise similar to the phase 1 regulations for simplicity in this paper we demonstrate the determination of the economic cost of this regulation using the details of the phase 1 specification the stated objective of the alberta framework is to manage cumulative water withdrawals to support both human and ecosystem needs while balancing social environmental and economic interests 33 p 3 the framework specifies aggregate permitted water withdrawals by oil sands mining firms depending on river conditions when river flows are below certain specified thresholds cutbacks in water diversions are required in the phase 1 framework river conditions are categorized as being in one of red yellow or green zones which signifies low medium and abundant water flows respectively in the green zone up to 15 of instantaneous flow is allowed to be cumulatively withdrawn by all five oil sands firms i e canadian natural resources imperial shell suncor and syncrude which operated in the lower athabasca river region during the years from 2007 to 2015 in the yellow zone the maximum amount of water allowed to be withdrawn is 10 of the average of hda80 8 8 hda80 is the river flow level corresponding to a habitat area level that is equaled or exceeded 80 of the time and q95 9 9 q95 is the flow level that is equaled or exceeded 95 of the time in the red zone a maximum 5 2 of the historical median flow in each week can be withdrawn fig 1 depicts average minimum and maximum river flows in the athabasca river since 1957 compared to the three zones set by the phase 1 framework it also shows the frequency with which river flows would be classified in the green yellow or red zones over that 60 year period it will be observed that the river did fall into the yellow or red zones with a significant frequency over this period alberta s water management framework is layered upon an existing prior appropriation regime or first in time first in right fitfir whereby senior license holders are given priority over more junior water license holders 10 10 before 1999 licenses to withdraw water were issued without expiry dates according to the water resources act since the water act took effect in 1999 new water licenses have a fixed time of validity usually ten years however with the implementation of the framework oil sands firms were asked to develop water sharing rules to be implemented in the red or yellow zones rather than following the rules of fitfir 34 the details of the agreed to water sharing rules in the event of water shortfalls are submitted annually to the government the 2008 2009 agreement gave priority to those firms holding older licenses 34 subsequent agreements at least since 2012 specify more equal sharing of the reductions in allowed water usage for example the agreement for the 2014 2015 winter period allocated the restricted water quantity during the yellow and red zones almost equally among the five oil sands extraction operators active at that time 11 11 in 2015 there were five firms operating open pit oil sands mining operations canadian natural resources ltd imperial oil ltd shell albian sands suncor energy inc and syncrude canada ltd see the oil sands water management agreement for the 2014 2015 winter period http osip alberta ca library dataset details 562 accessed on january 11 2020 it stipulates that when the amount withdrawn by any individual operator exceeds the assigned allotment the operator should report this to the relevant alberta government department however there is no punishment specified for exceeding the agreed to allotment river flows are highly seasonal and the phase 1 framework encourages firms to store water during times of high water availability for use during times of shortfall imperial oil s kearn lake project was the first to invest in water storage in order to eliminate the need to withdraw water from the river during low flow seasons 12 12 see page 19 of imperial oils 2012 summary

accessed on january 11 2020 3 model description we analyze the case of a hypothetical oil sands firm in the lower athabasca river region we assume the operation is large enough that a single water storage pond will serve only one operation the decision model is based on the one developed in 11 however the current model includes the constraint on water withdrawals which follows a poisson process includes water inventory as an additional state variable and includes the decision to construct storage as an optimal control 3 1 oil production and water usage we assume that the firm is already producing bitumen from its oil sands development and that there is a fixed oil to water ratio accordingly we assume a linear production function 1 q w p t t η w p t η 0 w p t 0 0 q w p t t q where q is output η is a constant indicating the number of barrels of bitumen that can be produced using one barrel of fresh water w p t is the water used in production at time t and q is a fixed upper limit on the rate of production with no water management regulations the firm can produce up to its full capacity by using water without any restriction in the presence of the framework in the absence of water storage capacity the firm has to cut back production during the yellow and red zones in which case profits will be impaired the firm has the option to install a water storage facility the inventory of water in storage i will be augmented by water withdrawals from the river w w and reduced by w p as water is drawn out of storage for use in oil production the change in water inventory is given by the following differential equation 2 d i w w t w p t d t the level of the water inventory in storage is constrained to be a positive number which is less than the storage capacity i max t 0 refers to time zero or the starting time for the analysis 3 i t i t 0 t 0 t w w t w p t d t 0 i t 0 ι 0 0 i t i max 3 2 water withdrawals from the river according to the framework a weekly constraint on fresh water withdrawals is set for the oil sands industry and the restricted cumulative withdrawal in the yellow and red conditions is allocated among five oil sands firms roughly evenly the rate of water withdrawal w w is restricted to be no greater than w where w w 1 w 2 w 3 the subscripts k 1 2 3 represent the river flow condition or water zone where k 1 is the green zone k 2 is the yellow zone and k 3 is the red zone it is assumed that the change of water constraint from the current zone k to another u can be described by a stochastic differential equation 4 d w u 1 3 w u t w k t d x k u k 1 2 3 where d x k u is a poisson process 5 d x k u 1 with probability λ k u d t 0 with probability 1 λ k u d t k 1 2 3 u 1 2 3 the poisson process is intended to reflect the natural variability in river flows we assume that the risk of uncertain water flows is not correlated with the economy and the stock market therefore it is a diversifiable risk and the real or p measure can be used to model d x 15 15 see 35 for an introductory discussion of the real or p measure versus the risk neutral or q björk 36 provides an advanced treatment 3 3 oil resource stock production depletes the resource

investigate the investment behavior of this firm five project stages are considered in stage 1 there is no water storage facility and the firm holds the option to suspend production stage 2 or to move on to stage 3 in which the water storage facility is installed and put into use with the presence of the water storage facility the firm can choose to stay in stage 3 or suspend the production temporarily stage 4 the final stage stage 5 is the permanent abandonment of the project when in stages 1 to 4 the firm can decide to abandon switching to stage 5 by paying an abandonment cost let δ m be the notation for each stage where m stands for the sequence number of stages and m 1 m in this study m 5 stages are summarized in the following table stage δ description 1 producing oil no storage 2 suspended no storage 3 producing oil storage installed 4 suspended storage installed 5 permanently abandoned 3 5 oil prices there is a substantial existing literature examining alternative models for stochastic resource prices seminal papers include 37 40 the best model choice depends on the context in which it will be used for this paper we desire a parsimonious model that provides a reasonable depiction of the behavior of oil prices but does not involve additional stochastic factors which unnecessarily complicate the solution of the hjb equation huang 41 provides a detailed examination of several alternative models of oil price dynamics for this paper the analysis is undertaken using a simple log mean reverting model the assumed stochastic differential equation describing oil prices under the q measure i e the risk neutral measure is given as follows 8 d p ε μ ln p t p t d t σ p t d z where p t is the crude oil spot price at time t in u s μ is the long run mean log price that ln p t tends to ε is the speed of the mean reversion σ is the volatility and d z is the increment of a wiener process ε μ ln p t p t and σ p t are called the drift term and the volatility term respectively d z and d x k u defined in eq 5 are assumed to be independent of each other 3 6 cash flows annual cash flows are derived from revenue from the production and sale of oil reserves less fixed variable costs and taxes both revenues and costs depend on the stage of operation whether the project is operating temporarily suspended or permanently abandoned at time t the realized profits will be 9 π p t s t w t i t δ t p t ρ c v e o c v n e o 1 δ 1 3 η w p p t s t w t i t δ t oil sales revenue c f o 1 δ 1 3 c s 1 δ 1 2 3 4 oil production costs c f s c v s i 1 δ 3 4 water storage costs λ p t δ t 1 δ 1 2 3 4 taxes where 1 δ δ m is the indicator function which equals one if δ δ m and zero otherwise ρ is the discount of bitumen prices against wti prices and λ is the sum of all applicable taxes the c s denote various fixed and variable costs for oil production and water storage and are listed in table 2 total taxes include three elements λ carbon tax royalty income tax calculated as shown in table 1 in addition to annual cash flows there are one time costs incurred to move from one stage to another to go from an operating stage without storage to one with storage the cost of constructing storage facilities must be incurred which we denote as c to switch from an operating stage to a suspended stage the mothball cost c m is incurred to move back from a suspended stage to an operating stage the reactivating cost c r e is incurred similarly to move from any stage to permanent abandonment an abandonment cost c r is incurred we also assume that it is not possible to move from a stage with water storage back to a stage without water storage or move from permanent abandonment back to any other stage this is implemented by setting the costs to these relevant stage switches as a very large number c l a r g e table 2 summarizes the costs incurred in or between stages 4 specification of the decision problem the firm s objective is to maximize the expected present value of cash flows from its oil sands operation over t years there are three control variables water withdrawals w w from the river oil production q which determines the water used in production w p and the decision to switch project stages which we denote δ control variables depend on five state variables the oil price p the resource stock s the water withdrawal limit w the water inventory in storage i and the project stage δ 4 1 admissible sets for control variables admissible sets are now specified for the control variables let z δ denote the admissible set for δ where 10 z δ δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 δ 5 the admissible set for oil production q depends on the resource stock water storage inventory project stage and water withdrawals from the river denote this admissible set as z q s i δ w w which is given as follows 11a q z q s i δ w w 11b z q 0 min s q η w w if s 0 δ δ 1 11c z q 0 min s q η w w i if s 0 δ δ 3 11d z q 0 if s 0 δ δ m m 1 3 11e z q 0 if δ δ m m 2 4 5 s eq 11b states that in stage δ 1 oil production is constrained by the stock of oil reserves the maximum oil production limit and the amount of water withdrawn from the river multiplied by the water productivity coefficient in stage 3 described in eq 11c water from the existing storage inventory is added to water withdrawals from the river as a constraint on water available for oil production define an admissible set for water withdrawals w w denoted z w w δ as follows 12 w w z w w δ z w 0 w 1 if w w 1 δ δ 1 δ 3 z w 0 w 2 if w w 2 δ δ 1 δ 3 z w 0 w 3 if w w 3 δ δ 1 δ 3 z w 0 if δ δ 2 δ 4 δ 5 4 2 optimal controls and value function it is assumed that at predetermined fixed times the firm makes a decision about whether to change to a different project stage these fixed times are denoted by t d 13 t d t 0 0 t 1 t m t m t the firm can switch stages instantaneously at t t d and may incur a switching cost in doing so at time t the project must be terminated and clean up costs are incurred in the numerical example in this paper the time between fixed decisions dates is set as one week choices regarding the rate of water withdrawal w w and oil production q are made in continuous time in time intervals given as follows 14 t c t 0 t 1 t m 1 t m t m t controls are specified as functions of state variables as follows q p s w i δ t w w p s w i δ t t t c δ p s w i δ t t t d let k denote the set of particular choices for the controls for all t m 15 k δ t t d q w w t t c for any particular k the value function v p s w ι δ t can be written as the expected discounted value of the integral of future cash flows with the expectation taken over the controls given the state variables where p s w ι δ denote particular realizations of the state variables p s w i and δ 16 v p s w ι δ

expectation is taken under the risk neutral or q measure in our numerical example the value in the final time period v p t s t w t i t δ t t is assumed to be the cost of clean up if the project had not been abandoned before t δ δ m m 1 2 3 4 or is equal to zero if the firm has already abandoned the project δ δ 5 eq 16 is solved for the optimal controls contained in the admissible sets eqs 10 11e and 12 and subject to equations for d s d w d i and d p 6 4 2 and 8 a dynamic programming algorithm is implemented solving backwards in time and proceeding in two phases 1 the decision to switch stages made at fixed time points t m and 2 the choice of water withdrawals and oil production made in continuous time in the interval t t m t m 1 where t m denotes the instant after t m and t m 1 denotes the instant before time t m 1 4 3 solution at fixed decision dates at any t m t d the firm chooses the optimal stage t m at which the project value minus any switching cost is at a maximum other things equal 17 δ p s w ι δ t m arg max δ v p s w ι δ t m c δ δ where c δ δ denotes the cost for switching from stage δ at time t m to stage δ at time t m table 3 specifies c δ δ at the intersection of δ th row and the δ th column c large indicates an arbitrarily large number which prevents switching between two particular stages for example c 3 1 c large indicating that the firm cannot switch from stage 3 when storage has been installed to stage 1 prior to storage having been installed 4 4 solution between fixed decision dates going backward in time from t m 1 to t m in this section we describe the solution going backwards in time between decision dates i e t m 1 t m define the differential operator l as follows 18 l v 1 2 b 2 2 v p 2 a v p q v s w w w p v i u 1 u k 3 λ k

is implemented using a fully implicit discretization scheme with semi lagrangian time stepping 17 17 a number of papers 43 45 introduce the method for solving stochastic optimal control problems more details can be found in these 46 and 47 the details and tests for the accuracy of the numerical solution are provided in the appendices of huang 41 5 specification of the parameters 5 1 oil prices the discount rate and exchange rate eq 8 was estimated in the risk neutral measure using futures contract prices on west texas intermediate crude oil data used was for contracts of less than one month to 17 months from january 1995 to december 2016 the data were deflated by the u s consumer price index so that eq 8 describes real oil prices the details of the estimation procedure are described in 41 the estimates obtained are ε 0 14 speed of mean reversion μ 4 59 long run log mean price σ 0 31 volatility this estimated model provides a good description of the data with in sample forecast errors of futures prices ranging from 0 6 to 1 6 depending on the contract length 41 fig 2 a shows the mean median and 5th and 95th percentiles for 100 000 simulations of the price model assuming an initial starting price of 80 per barrel we observe a wide range between the 5th and 95th percentiles which reflects the quite large volatility term recall that this is in the risk neutral measure so it reflects a risk premium demanded by market participants to invest in oil linked assets for reference historical wti prices since 2007 deflated by the u s cpi are shown in fig 2 b more recently the world oil price has been negatively affected by short term the covid 19 pandemic and long term events increased pressures to reduce fossil fuel use to see how an outlook for a lower oil price in the long run would affect our results we examined a pessimistic price sensitivity with μ 3 69 implying a long run mean price of u s 40 per barrel in section 6 results are described for the base case and also for the pessimistic price sensitivity when there are significant differences with the base case with regard to the discount of bitumen prices against wti prices ρ see eq 9 as in 11 we fix it at the level of 83 in other words we fix the oil sands price in canadian dollars at 83 of the wti price in us dollars in reality the bitumen price discount is highly variable and could itself be modeled as a second stochastic factor the real risk free interest rate is set at 2 percent the values of oil sands operation are expressed in us using an c us exchange rate of 0 85 5 2 production capacity reserves and water use intensity we choose a hypothetical plant with a production capacity of 240 000 barrels day which is similar in size to syncrude s aurora north project 18 18 48 49 it is further assumed that the resource base is 880 million barrels which implies that with extraction at full capacity the reserves would be exhausted after 10 years it is assumed that there are 10 years remaining in the firm s lease with the alberta government allowing bitumen extractions from the site sensitivities are conducted for different remaining lease lengths up to 30 years water conservation has been a focus of oil sands firms for the past decade data from the aer shows that from 2015 to 2019 water use intensity varied by firm and over time ranging from 1 1 to 4 0 barrels of water per barrel of oil with an average over all firms of 2 41 in 2015 and 2 18 in 2019 19 19 these numbers reflect water use intensity defined as the quantity of non saline water that is make up water meaning it is extracted from new sources rather than being recycled water source alberta energy regulator website water use performance oil sands mining accessed january 11 2020 and 50 water use intensity varies due to factors such as the stage of operations production targets and processes used to separate bitumen from oil sands for our hypothetical oil sands project we adopt syncrude s 2019 water use intensity level of 3 01 barrels of water barrel of oil therefore η 1 3 01 0 33 given our assumed production capacity of 240 000 barrels day this implies water demand of 722 400 barrels per day 5 06 million barrels per week 5 3 water withdrawal limits the alberta s phase 1 framework sets rules for determining water withdrawal limits in different zones and also explicitly lists for each week how many cubic meters of water per second the oil sands industry is permitted to remove from the athabasca river in the yellow and red zones based on the historical flow record up to 2007 the weekly water limits in the yellow and red zones for the entire oil sands industry are depicted in fig 3 as mentioned the permitted water withdrawal during the yellow and the red zones is allocated almost evenly among the oil sands operators with active projects according to the water sharing agreement we assume that the allocation is exactly even among active operators note that some operators have more than one mine and determine how their water allocation is divided across their different mines based on five active operators in 2015 the resulting specific weekly water assigned to a firm is listed in table 4 each firm s lowest weekly available water is 7 7 million barrels for the red zone and 10 6 million barrels for the yellow zone as noted the hypothetical oil sands mine is of similar capacity to syncrude s aurora facility syncrude operates the mildred lake and aurora mines which together have a production capacity of about 791 000 barrels per day 20 20 48 and 50 alberta mineable oil sands plant statistics monthly supplement december 2015 and 2019 we assume the hypothetical oil sands mine is part of an operation similar to syncrude s in scale and is allocated water based on its share of production aurora s production represents about 60 of the total from mildred lake and aurora combined 50 hence we assume the hypothetical mine has a weekly water allocation of 4 6 and 6 3 million barrels in the red and yellow zones respectively the hypothetical mine requires 5 06 million barrels of water per week and hence the restrictions would be binding in the red zone but not the yellow zone the parameter λ k u d t in eq 5 refers to the hazard rate which is the instantaneous probability of switching from river flow zone k to u in the period of d t historical data of athabasca river flows indicates that in recent years the river flows are lower compared to the average historical level for illustrative purposes we adopt the relatively low river flows condition of 2015 for estimating the hazard rates based on data from alberta environment for 2015 river flows we calculate average values for λ i j for all i 1 2 3 and j 1 2 3 where 1 corresponds to the green zone 2 the yellow zone and 3 the red zone as follows λ i j n i j n i 1 d t where n i is the number of weeks in 2015 that are in the zone specified by i n i j is the number of times that the zone switches from i to j in 2015 and d t is 1 week the resulting hazard rate matrix is as follows 40 7 11 3 0 12 2 36 7 3 1 0 4 3 47 7 where the entry at the i th row and the j th column stands for λ i j for example λ 12 11 3 implies that over one week the probability of switching from the green zone to the yellow zone is λ 12 d t 11 3 1 52 22 5 4 storage and production costs the last five years have witnessed significant decreases in the cost of oil sands production a recent alberta government document states that in response to the collapse of oil prices in 2014 oil sands operators adjusted to a lower price environment by new efficiencies and technological advances 51 resulting in significant reductions in operating costs and sustaining capital costs operating costs for oil sands mining are reported to have declined from c 34 9 to c 27 per barrel while sustaining capital costs declined from 6 to 3 8 per barrel between 2014 and 2018 for this study assumptions for the operating and sustaining capital costs of oil sands facilities are based on estimates provided by the canadian energy research institute ceri 52 appropriately scaled for the size of the hypothetical project in light of cost reductions since 2015 the ceri estimated costs were reduced by 30 the resulting costs are given in table 5 for energy and non energy variable costs fixed operating costs sustaining capital costs and abandonment costs 21 21 note that abandonment costs are assumed to be 2 of the original capital costs for the oil sands facility estimated at 17 billion using the 30 cost reduction factor abandonment costs are set at 238 million where all of these costs are 70 of values estimated in 52 we will comment on the effects of these cost reductions in section 6 5 about 80 percent of the water used in oil sands is recycled 53 the alberta government has maintained a zero discharge policy meaning that all oil sands process water must be contained on site in tailings storage facilities and no releases into the environment are permitted the buildup of large volumes of waste water in tailing ponds has caused the alberta government to consider allowing limited releases of liquid waste into the athabasca river provided the wastewater has been treated 54 while the cost of maintaining tailings ponds is included as part of capital and operating costs there is no consideration given in this paper to the potential costs of water treatment information on water storage capacity was obtained from imperial oil s description of their kearl oil sands project which commenced production on april 27 2013 22 22 source information provided on the website of imperial oil http www imperialoil ca canada english operations sands kearl environment aspx accessed on january 11 2020 like the kearl project it is assumed that storage can sustain 30 days production during the dry season which implies a water storage capacity of about 24 million barrels a report of 55 showed that the capital cost for fresh water storage is c 16 m 3 and the annual operating costs for the storage is 5 of capital cost plus relevant power costs the assumed capacity of our water storage i max is 24 million barrels or 2 87 cubic meters which implies a capital cost of c 46 million applying the cost reduction factor gives a capital cost c of c 32 million and the fixed cost of running the facility c f s of c 1 6 million year in the absence of publicly available information it is assumed that the variable cost of operating the storage capacity c v s is c 0 0024 barrel it is further assumed that the construction of the storage pond can be accomplished instantaneously table 5 details the parameter value assumptions for the hypothetical project in the base case including cost assumptions noted above as well as the carbon tax royalty rates 23 23 the royalty rate differs between the pre payout and the post payout phases of a project before the point that a project s cumulative revenues start to cover its cumulative costs it is in the pre payout phase after this point it is in the post payout phase without altering the qualitative results of our research we assume that the studied project is in the pre payout phase exchange rate and risk free interest rate 6 results we examine four different scenarios to highlight the impact of different river conditions and the strictness of water withdrawal limits regarding the former we contrast results with river conditions as they were in 2015 the wetter scenario with a drier scenario in which the river is always in the red zone fig 4 shows the two examined river flow conditions with a box plot of historical weekly river flows the boxplots indicate the first quartile represented by the lower edge of each box the third quartile the upper edge of each box the median the short horizontal bar cutting through each box the maximum level the highest tip of the dashed whisker the minimum level the lowest tip of the dashed whisker and outliers the plus signs of the historical weekly river flow rate we observe that 2015 was drier than the historical record for flow levels while red zone flow levels are even drier both the wetter and drier river conditions are examined using i phase 1 restrictions and ii stricter regulations in which withdrawals in the red and yellow zones are tightened by 1 35 million barrels per week which represents up to 30 and 42 of the weekly withdrawal limit respectively we summarize the four scenarios in table 6 6 1 the firm with no storage option water regulations will have the largest impact when the firm has no technological option available to alleviate water shortages note also that a reliance on water storage has been the subject of controversy due to potential negative environmental consequences as discussed in 57 fig 5 depicts the solution surface for w l which shows the project s values at time zero 24 24 at time zero there are still 10 years left until the oil extraction lease expires corresponding to different combinations of the oil sands resource stock and crude oil price when the present i e time zero river flow condition is in the green zone this graph depicts project value for different values of the state variables assuming the project owner acts optimally in the choice of controls until the lease end date at time t as expected other things equal the project s value rises with an increase in oil price as well as with an increase in resource stock when the present time zero river flow condition is in either of the other zones the shape of the solution surface is very similar to that in fig 5 and hence additional scenarios are not shown to compare the project values across the four scenarios fig 6 shows the present value of the project at time zero versus the oil price given the resource stock at the maximum level of 880 million barrels and the river is in the red zone the comparison is similar for other levels of reserves the upper set of curves depicts the base case scenarios and the lower set depicts the pessimistic oil price sensitivity for reference a case when there are no water restrictions is also shown referring first to the base case it may be observed that the stricter the water withdrawal limits or the drier the river flow condition the lower the project s value however in general the differences are small selected values are shown in table 7 where we observe that the values for the scenarios with lenient regulations w l and w s are very close to the values under no restrictions at all in addition with a time zero oil price of the 40 barrel the project s value is reduced by 329 million or 2 1 in w s compared to the scenario with no restrictions spread over the total reserves of 880 million barrels this amounts to 0 37 per barrel of oil reserves this difference is greater under dry river conditions project value under d s is 7 8 or 1224 million lower than under no restrictions which amounts to 1 39 per barrel of oil reserves we observe a similar pattern for the pessimistic oil price sensitivity but the relative differences are larger see table 10 in appendix b project abandonment will occur when reserves run out when the lease ends or when the oil price is so low that the firm is better off abandoning rather than maintaining an active mine abandonment requires the firm to pay rehabilitation costs but the firm thereby avoids the costs of the oil sands operation rather than abandoning the firm also has the option to suspend production but still incurs the large annual sustaining capital costs which at c 400 million exceed the abandonment cost of c 238 million the strictness of water withdrawal limits will affect a firm s decision about when to permanently abandon a project if water withdrawal restrictions become suddenly stricter such that the project value is negative then the optimal decision is to abandon the project immediately however if it remains optimal for the firm to continue the project the effect of stricter limits is not immediately obvious due to two opposing effects first stricter water restrictions imply reduced production in dry periods which the firm will try to make it up in wetter periods this might delay the abandonment time on the other hand stricter water restrictions reduce the value of the project which increases the probability of abandonment in the future we investigate this effect for our hypothetical project by examining critical prices to abandon the project if the oil price is greater than the critical price the firm s optimal choice is to continue the project otherwise it should shut down the project permanently a lower critical price for abandonment implies a longer expected time before abandonment table 8 lists the critical prices to abandon the project from the suspended state at time zero for the four scenarios and for different levels of oil reserves 25 25 for succinctness we do not show critical prices to abandon the project if in the operating state at higher reserve levels above 80 million barrels critical prices to temporarily suspend the project are always greater than or equal to critical prices to abandon the project from the operating state this implies for reserve levels above 80 the project will be suspended prior to abandonment the table shows critical prices of zero if remaining reserves are 200 million barrels or greater implying the project would never be abandoned at lower reserve levels abandonment is optimal for prices ranging from 5 to 20 per barrel overall there is little change in critical prices between strict and lenient regulations table 11 in appendix b shows critical prices for abandonment for the pessimistic price sensitivity there are higher critical prices for abandonment at some remaining reserve levels in the d s scenario compared to the d l scenario but overall the effect is small 6 2 option to install a water storage facility fig 7 compares project values with and without the option to install storage and table 9 provides some selected values as expected this option makes the project more valuable but the effect is only significant for the d s scenario where the value with the storage option exceeds that when there is no storage available by over 7 at both 40 or 100 per barrel for the time zero oil price for the other scenarios the percent differences are smaller 0 1 2 1 and 0 8 respectively for scenarios w l w s and d l at a time zero oil price of 100 barrel the increased value with storage available is relatively larger for the pessimistic price sensitivity i e 0 2 3 3 1 1 and 11 1 for w l w s d l and d s respectively see figure 13 in the appendix b it may also be observed from table 9 that the difference in project value between scenarios is tiny less than 1 note that the value with no restrictions is the same whether or not storage is installed storage only provides value to the firm when water restrictions are imposed given uncertain future oil prices and water restrictions the firm chooses the timing to install the water storage facility to optimize the present value of the project the critical prices to switch from stage 1 operating no storage to stage 3 operating with storage indicate the optimal strategy for the decision to invest in water storage if the crude oil price is greater than the critical price it is optimal to invest in storage otherwise the investment should be delayed the critical prices depend on the state variables including present river flow conditions as well as the resource stock level fig 8 depicts critical prices to proceed to stage 3 at different resource stock levels for the four scenarios it is observed that critical prices to install storage are much higher for low reserve levels implying that for smaller resource stocks or as reserves are depleted it is less likely to be optimal to make the investment in water storage critical prices are also significantly lower implying the firm is more likely to install storage when river conditions are drier comparing red and green zones and water restrictions are more severe d l and d s versus w l and w s respectively in section 6 1 it was observed that even without the option to install storage the critical prices for abandoning the project are fairly low and are not very sensitive to different scenarios when the option to install storage is available it will be even less likely that the project will be abandoned before the end of the lease at time t our results confirm this with critical prices for abandonment that are the same as or lower than when there is no storage option these critical price tables are not shown 6 3 the marginal cost of stricter water withdrawal constraints in this section we calculate the marginal costs of water withdrawal restrictions we define marginal cost to be the change in the expected value of the project to the firm at time zero caused by a marginal reduction in allowed water withdrawals in all future time periods this is a long run marginal cost in that it is assumed the firm will respond optimally to the change in water restrictions and may adopt new technology through the installation of storage the marginal cost estimate provides a lower limit for the marginal benefits needed in order for the regulation to be welfare enhancing the marginal cost also indicates a firm s willingness to pay for water and hence would be the price expected if a water trading scheme were implemented the marginal cost of increased restrictions depends on the value of the state variables we estimate the marginal cost of the restrictions to the hypothetical firm m c by taking the present value of the hypothetical firm v p s w ι δ t in a given river zone where w w at a specific oil price level p p at a certain oil stock level s s and finding the change in v p s w ι δ t when the permitted withdrawal rates in the yellow and red zones are further restricted by δ w 26 26 due to the accuracy of the numerical method the smallest marginal change that can be examined is 1 million barrels of water per week over the lifespan of the project the change in the firm s present value is in millions of dollars over the lifespan of the project i e t t 0 that is to say m c δ v p s w ι δ t δ w t t 0 the marginal cost of increased restrictions is mapped out for a range of initial water restrictions and shown in fig 9 below the figure is shown for an initial oil price of 50 per barrel and assuming the oil stock is at its maximum level the horizontal axis shows the adjustment of the level of available water for the oil sands mining sector with water constraint regulations becoming more strict in all future time periods moving from right to left the point labeled as 0 reflects the restrictions as in the phase 1 framework moving to the left 119 means that the water withdrawal limits in the red and yellow zones have been reduced by 2 3 million barrels each week or 119 million barrels each year compared to the phase 1 framework moving to the right 119 implies a comparable relaxing of restrictions for a given stage of operation in general it would be expected that the marginal cost of water restrictions would decline as restrictions become less onerous moving from left to right on the graph however the curve in fig 9 is non monotonic with several distinct regions this reflects the long run nature of the curve in which the option to install water storage affects the marginal cost further the storage installation represents a lumpy asset which cannot be acquired in small increments to interpret this graph it is helpful to consider each of four regions and observe the critical price to install storage in each region 237 and greater mc curve has a zero or negative slope critical prices to install storage are infinite indicating it is never optimal to install storage 119 to 237 mc curve is positively sloped critical prices to install storage are positive indicating it may be optimal to install storage at some future time if the price of oil exceeds the critical price 831 to 119 mc curve has zero or negative slope critical prices to install storage are below the time zero price of 50 barrel hence it is optimal to install storage immediately for further intuition we plot on the same graph the marginal cost curves for when there is no storage available blue dashed curve and when storage is freely available red dashed curve and hence is a free option which will always be exercised it can be seen that the marginal cost curve for the firm in stage 1 with the storage option falls between these two other cases we are unable to determine the efficient level of water restrictions as we do not have an estimate of the benefits to the ecosystem of an additional unit of water flowing in the river a hypothetical marginal benefit curve in shown in fig 9 indicating an efficient level of restrictions of about 500 million barrels relative to the phase 1 restrictions at point 0 the efficiency gain of moving from phase 1 to 500 is indicated by the blue shaded area in general the efficiency loss when the restrictions are not at the optimal levels depends on the slopes and locations of the marginal benefit curve and the marginal cost curve note that if the marginal benefit curve crossed the rising portion of the marginal cost curve then there would be no unique point where mb mc in this circumstance the total benefits and total costs would need to be examined for a range of restrictions to find the optimum the marginal cost of restrictions will depend on the state variables such as the oil price and the river conditions in particular fig 10 displays a marginal cost curves for different oil prices levels at time zero as well as the assumed marginal benefit curve it will be observed that different levels of the current oil price imply a different efficient water constraint a similar figure can be drawn for different river conditions at time zero this figure not shown indicates significantly higher marginal costs when in the dry river conditions it is impractical to change the level of water restrictions based on these changing states which shift the marginal cost curve however this highlights the fact that quantitative water restrictions have a varying cost for firms depending on current conditions which has implications for the efficiency consequences of the regulations 6 4 the effects of price volatility oil price volatility σ in eq 8 is of interest for at least two reasons first given that the current oil price has a significant impact on the marginal cost of restrictions it is worthwhile exploring the effect of the price volatility assumption on the marginal cost second asset price volatility is a much studied phenomenon in the investment under uncertainty literature it is well known that for a simple investment options an increase in volatility results in the delay of the investment 58 this section explores how an increase in volatility would affect the decision to install storage we compared the marginal cost and total cost of stricter water regulations for a variety of volatility assumptions in all scenarios the marginal and total costs of the regulations did not change substantially under different volatility assumptions for example when restrictions are set according to the phase 1 framework and time zero river conditions are in the red zone a doubling of σ from 0 9 to 1 8 reduced the marginal cost from 1 43 per barrel to 1 40 per barrel increasing volatility has several effects and whether the marginal cost will rise or fall depends on the case being examined an increase in volatility can increase the value of the oil producing asset as there will be more high price realizations which increases revenue while the effect of low price realizations is muted by the option to temporarily suspend operations on the other hand more restrictive water limitations reduce the ability of the firm to take advantage of high prices in this study the net effect at time zero of an increase in volatility is a slight reduction in the cost of restrictions to consider the effect of changing volatility on the decision to invest in storage fig 11 plots critical prices to install storage versus volatility for several scenarios looking first at the d s scenario in the red zone fig 11 a the critical prices are observed to fall as volatility increases implying that higher volatility results in an earlier investment in storage this contrasts to the result for simple investment options noted above intuitively in this scenario when water flows are reduced and water withdrawals are heavily constrained an increase in price volatility makes storage more valuable to the firm without storage and under binding water constraints the firm may not be able to take advantage of a sudden upswing in prices hence the more volatile prices increase the desirability of storage fig 11 b shows a similar effect for the w l scenario in the red zone for most of the reserve levels plotted however for w l in the green zone shown in fig 11 c critical prices as volatility rises in this scenario water withdrawals are only mildly constrained and hence increases in volatility tend to delay investment as per the normal effect of uncertainty figure 15 in appendix a shows the same information for the low price sensitivity again the impact of price volatility varies with the level of water restrictions 6 5 changing costs and water use intensity the cost of water regulations have changed over time as the oil sands industry has responded to economic pressures and environmental concerns as noted in section 5 4 there has been a significant decline in capital and operating costs since 2015 to investigate the effect of this improved efficiency we redid the numerical example using capital and operating costs as of 2015 which are 30 higher than those assumed for 2019 with higher costs the value of the oil sands operation is reduced by 7 15 depending on the oil price at time zero for the pessimistic price sensitivity the reduction in value ranges from 15 40 with higher costs impact of water restrictions is more evident for example the marginal cost of restrictions in the base case as depicted in fig 9 ranges from 0 for more lenient restrictions 119 on the horizontal axis to 0 25 million at the tightest restrictions 831 on the horizontal axis with 2015 costs the comparable portion of the marginal cost curve ranges from 0 to 0 42 million over the last two decades water productivity has improved as efforts have been made to increase water recycling although non saline water use also shows considerable variability from year to year as is indicated on the aer s website 59 the aer reports that between 2015 and 2019 syncrude s intensity of water use has ranged from 2 84 barrels water barrel of oil to 4 04 barrels water barrel of oil for our analysis we used the 2019 value of 3 01 for water intensity which gives η 0 33 when the intensity of water use is 2 5 barrels water barrel of oil or less we find that there is no need to invest in a water storage facility regardless of the river flow zone and there is no cost to the firm of the water restrictions fig 12 displays the marginal costs of restrictions under different water intensity assumptions 6 6 changing the lease end date t the base case assumption for the time remaining in the mining lease is ten years t 10 sensitivities were conducted for t extending to 30 years a longer lease length provides more flexibility to the oil sands firm in terms of the timing of extraction the firm can more easily adapt to unfavorable events such as water restrictions or low oil prices by postponing production to the future assuming t 30 years the total value of the project increases significantly however the qualitative conclusions regarding the impact of water restrictions are the same for example table 7 shows how project value declines under stricter water regulations given t 10 for t 30 the effect in percentage terms is somewhat less in particular when t 30 and there is no option to install storage project value in the w s scenario is 1 to 2 percent lower than the w l scenario while project value in the d s scenario is 4 to 5 percent lower that in the d l scenario the conclusion is unchanged that the relative cost of water restrictions is quite low the option to install storage increases project value but by a lesser amount in percent terms when t 30 for example at an initial oil price of 100 bbl in the d s scenario the option to add storage increases project value by about 4 percent compared to the 7 7 percent that was reported in section 6 2 for t 10 because the benefit of storage is reduced the critical prices that would induce a firm to invest in storage are increased 7 concluding comments this paper studies the cost of regulations designed to limit river water withdrawals by a large mining operation in order to protect surrounding ecosystems a stochastic optimal control approach is used to model the impact of these restrictions on firm profitability and to estimate the marginal cost to the firm of imposing stricter regulations the marginal cost estimates are an important input to regulatory design as they represent the shadow prices of water for the firm and may be considered as minimum values required for the environmental benefits to justify the regulation the methodology and conclusions from this analysis of a hypothetical oil sands mining operation can inform the assessment of regulations for other types of resource extraction projects some key observations and findings of this paper are summarized below estimates of the cost of regulations should be forward looking reflecting the change in firm value under different regulatory rules the analysis showed that the marginal cost of changing regulations depends critically on assumptions about key state variables such as future river conditions and the price of oil modeling the firm s decisions as a stochastic dynamic optimal control problem incorporates the uncertainty in both of these factors and demonstrates how the cost of regulations depends on a firm s optimal responses impact of investment in water storage technology the option to install storage reduces the marginal cost of restrictions this indicates the importance of considering potential technological investments in response to regulations low cost of the regulations alberta s phase 1 water management framework does not impose a large cost on firms given historical river flow conditions of the athabasca river the cost of restrictions has fallen since the regulations were first implemented as firms made investments to improve the efficiency of their operations the costs remain low even under assumptions of much drier conditions balancing the benefits and costs of regulations there is considerable uncertainty about how much water can be safely diverted from the river without harming the aquatic ecosystem given the low marginal cost estimates this analysis reveals that there is scope for adopting stricter regulations if there is a desire to provide added protection for in stream river flows impact of future oil prices an outlook for a lower long run average oil price increases the marginal cost of restrictions as a percent of mine value this is an important consideration given worldwide commitments to reduce oil consumption to limit carbon emissions which would put downward pressure on future oil prices non monotonic impact of increasing price volatility it is well known in the finance literature that for a simple investment option increased price volatility is likely to delay the optimal investment timing however we find that under very dry river conditions increased volatility can reduce the critical price required to install storage implying that the expected time for the investment is sooner as price volatility is increased high price realizations become more likely which increases the value of the ability to ramp up production making storage more valuable to the firm in contrast under more plentiful water conditions when water restrictions are less binding an increase in oil price volatility can delay the optimal investment in water storage as per the normal effect declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a boundary conditions boundary conditions must be established for

introduction the management of scarce water supplies is an issue of increasing concern in many areas of the world and is exacerbated by uncertainty surrounding the impacts of a warming planet on water availability the resource extraction industry is responsible for large withdrawals of water and competition for water supplies may put industry operations into conflict with local communities these conflicts arise when water demands for resource extraction encroach on the water supplies available for other human activities or compromise aquatic ecosystems protection of the public interest requires that governments around the world specify limits on water withdrawals and enforce legal and regulatory requirements regarding water access rights media and industry reports make it clear that competition for water supplies is of increasing concern for firms involved in resource extraction water availability has been reported as being one of the biggest problems facing mining firms today 2 2 see for example a july 27 2014 financial times article water scarcity and rising energy costs threaten mining industry a moody s investor service report global mining industry water scarcity could increase rating pressure on global mining companies february 14 2013 and 1 similar concerns have been raised regarding shale gas development 3 3 see discussions in 2 and 3 regulatory responses vary across jurisdictions depending on the state of water supplies the nature of other competing uses as well as the existing political legal and regulatory frameworks thomashausen et al 4 review the legal framework regulating water use for gold and copper mining in eight different countries all countries surveyed required mining firms to obtain water licenses or permits as well as undertake some sort of environmental assessment the basis for allocating water shares varies and is typically some combination of riparian or prior appropriation rights as well as rules about the transfer or trading of water rights in theory a social planner would impose the efficient limits on water withdrawals which balance the benefit of maintaining particular water levels in a water source with the cost of those restrictions to current and anticipated future water users in practice regulators charged with restricting water withdrawals to protect surrounding ecosystems face a difficult balancing act especially if proposed water regulations are viewed as a threat by existing water users determining the benefits and costs of water limitations can be problematic particularly when the impact of large water withdrawals on ecosystems are not well understood and require additional scientific study the impact of water restrictions on large industrial water users depends on the future path of key variables including the impacts of a changing climate on water availability prospects for water conserving technologies and the market demand for the industry s output failure to understand the costs of water regulations to large water users increases the likelihood that water restrictions will be set at an inappropriate level and may represent a missed opportunity to improve ecosystem protection at a low cost alternatively a determination that restrictions are very costly to firms points to the need for a process to respond appropriately to ameliorate those costs in this paper we argue that considerable insight into the costs of water restrictions can be gained by modeling a firm s decision making as a stochastic optimal control problem this approach allows for the explicit modeling of key uncertain variables and the different options facing the firm in choosing its responses our study undertakes a systematic analysis of the cost of water regulations imposed on a particular resource extraction activity mining of the oil sands in alberta canada this case is of interest as it manifests several important features commonly arising in cases of industrial water regulation in particular the severity of imposed regulations varies with a particular environmental indicator which will change over time in response to changing weather and climate conditions second profitability of the industry and hence the cost of restrictions depends on volatile market conditions third firms can reduce the cost of regulations by making capital investments such as in water storage facilities the specific contribution of this paper is to demonstrate a rigorous approach using stochastic dynamic programming to examining the cost of environmental regulations for a firm this amounts to use of a provably convergent numerical technique 4 4 the numerical convergence of this stochastic dynamic approach to a meaningful solution is described in 5 for finance applications which illuminates the impact of regulations on the profit maximizing decisions of a typical oil sands firm innovative features of the model include uncertain regulatory limits on water withdrawals and the option to invest in water storage technology water demands by the firm are determined by optimal decisions about oil production given available oil reserves and the terms of a license agreement with the government oil production and hence water use is affected by volatile oil prices determined in world markets a numerical example is presented based on available data for oil sands production technology and costs with oil prices described by a stochastic differential equation and water restrictions modeled as a poisson process the model allows us to examine several important phenomena including the marginal cost of stricter water regulations the impact of regulations on optimal decisions such as when to install storage and when to abandon the project and the impact of uncertain oil prices and water levels on a firm s behavior to the best of our knowledge no previous literature examines the cost of restrictions in this rigorous fashion this paper contributes to the literature on optimal natural resource use under uncertainty as exemplified by papers such as 6 10 and 11 similar to 10 and 11 the firm s decision problem is specified by a hamilton jacobi bellman hjb equation which is solved using a numerical method as there is no closed form solution the paper extends the analysis in previous papers by including an uncertain regulatory constraint resulting from natural variability in the environment it also contributes to the environmental economics literature addressing water issues specifically a paper with a similar motivation is 12 which examines the efficiency of alberta s water regulations for the oil sands using a deterministic model their focus is the efficiency of the protocol for water sharing among firms as a preview some key highlights of the paper are summarized below a long run marginal cost curve is derived showing the impact of tightening water restrictions the shape of the curve is non monotonic due to the lumpy discrete nature of storage investments alberta s regulations on water withdrawals from the lower athabasca river 13 impose only a very small cost on the hypothetical oil sands firm analyzed in this paper costs to the firm only become significant when future river conditions are drier than in the past decade and regulations are stricter this finding implies that current regulations could be made stricter at a relatively low cost oil price volatility affects the decision to invest in water storage facilities in an interesting way depending on the extent to which water limitations are binding when water withdrawals are highly restricted an increase in price volatility makes the investment in storage more likely i e the critical oil price for investment is reduced in contrast when water restrictions are not binding an increase in oil price volatility makes it optimal to delay investment in water storage the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 provides background information related to the oil sands industry and alberta s water use regulations sections 3 and 4 develop a model for the stochastic optimal control problem section 5 describes the determination of parameter values in the model section 6 elaborates on the results section 7 summarizes the conclusions 2 regulation of water use in the alberta oil sands open pit oil sands mining depends heavily on fresh water as an input in contrast to in situ projects which are able to use both saline and fresh water 5 5 kuwayama et al 14 provide an overview of water resource used for the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels up to date data is available from the alberta energy regulator the large ramping up in the scale of oil sands activity in the early 2000s brought public attention to the quantity of both surface and groundwater withdrawals as well as many other environmental impacts that have been well documented in the literature 6 6 see 15 17 and 18 for details moreover in the early to mid 2000s forecasts pointed to ongoing increases in oil sands production which resulted in significant concerns being expressed about the impacts of water withdrawals on the aquatic ecosystem 19 26 combined with the conclusions drawn by some scholars 17 24 27 31 that there is a declining trend of the river flow in the athabasca catchment public alarm about impacts on the aquatic ecosystem was unsurprising according to 32 in the lower athabasca river the collective withdrawals constitute only a tiny percentage of the river flow less than 0 6 of average total river flows and about 3 of the lowest weekly winter flows however since the river flows vary significantly between seasons while oil sands production has less seasonal variation in water short seasons there are risks that the withdrawals will exceed the sustainable level and damage aquatic habitat note there is considerable scientific uncertainty over how much water can be safely diverted from the river without harming the aquatic ecosystem 7 7 see for example a ctv news report from march 19 2014 alberta s plan for athabasca river pathetic not science based critics by bob weber the canadian press this article quotes david schindler a university of alberta ecologist who claims a lack of scientific evidence for the chosen water restrictions and argues that even a couple of inches less in the river can have a critical impact on fish habitat bug populations water quality ground water etc in addition the river sustains the livelihood and culture of first nations and metis communities in the area and low flow hinders navigation on the river the peace athabasca delta is a landscape of great ecological significance located within one of canada s 15 unesco world heritage sites its ecosystem is heavily dependent on the river flow level of the athabasca river 27 in response to these concerns the alberta government drafted a river management plan for the lower athabasca river to limit withdrawals according to river conditions the management plan was first imposed in 2007 and is described in the phase 1 framework 13 this phase 1 framework was intended to address immediate needs for water protection based on available evidence in 2007 with the intention that the regulations would be revised in future based on the results of further research additional research and consultation with stakeholders were carried out over the subsequent seven years resulting in a revision to the water regulations released in 2015 as the phase 2 framework 33 the phase 2 regulations imposed a somewhat finer classification of water flow conditions but are otherwise similar to the phase 1 regulations for simplicity in this paper we demonstrate the determination of the economic cost of this regulation using the details of the phase 1 specification the stated objective of the alberta framework is to manage cumulative water withdrawals to support both human and ecosystem needs while balancing social environmental and economic interests 33 p 3 the framework specifies aggregate permitted water withdrawals by oil sands mining firms depending on river conditions when river flows are below certain specified thresholds cutbacks in water diversions are required in the phase 1 framework river conditions are categorized as being in one of red yellow or green zones which signifies low medium and abundant water flows respectively in the green zone up to 15 of instantaneous flow is allowed to be cumulatively withdrawn by all five oil sands firms i e canadian natural resources imperial shell suncor and syncrude which operated in the lower athabasca river region during the years from 2007 to 2015 in the yellow zone the maximum amount of water allowed to be withdrawn is 10 of the average of hda80 8 8 hda80 is the river flow level corresponding to a habitat area level that is equaled or exceeded 80 of the time and q95 9 9 q95 is the flow level that is equaled or exceeded 95 of the time in the red zone a maximum 5 2 of the historical median flow in each week can be withdrawn fig 1 depicts average minimum and maximum river flows in the athabasca river since 1957 compared to the three zones set by the phase 1 framework it also shows the frequency with which river flows would be classified in the green yellow or red zones over that 60 year period it will be observed that the river did fall into the yellow or red zones with a significant frequency over this period alberta s water management framework is layered upon an existing prior appropriation regime or first in time first in right fitfir whereby senior license holders are given priority over more junior water license holders 10 10 before 1999 licenses to withdraw water were issued without expiry dates according to the water resources act since the water act took effect in 1999 new water licenses have a fixed time of validity usually ten years however with the implementation of the framework oil sands firms were asked to develop water sharing rules to be implemented in the red or yellow zones rather than following the rules of fitfir 34 the details of the agreed to water sharing rules in the event of water shortfalls are submitted annually to the government the 2008 2009 agreement gave priority to those firms holding older licenses 34 subsequent agreements at least since 2012 specify more equal sharing of the reductions in allowed water usage for example the agreement for the 2014 2015 winter period allocated the restricted water quantity during the yellow and red zones almost equally among the five oil sands extraction operators active at that time 11 11 in 2015 there were five firms operating open pit oil sands mining operations canadian natural resources ltd imperial oil ltd shell albian sands suncor energy inc and syncrude canada ltd see the oil sands water management agreement for the 2014 2015 winter period http osip alberta ca library dataset details 562 accessed on january 11 2020 it stipulates that when the amount withdrawn by any individual operator exceeds the assigned allotment the operator should report this to the relevant alberta government department however there is no punishment specified for exceeding the agreed to allotment river flows are highly seasonal and the phase 1 framework encourages firms to store water during times of high water availability for use during times of shortfall imperial oil s kearn lake project was the first to invest in water storage in order to eliminate the need to withdraw water from the river during low flow seasons 12 12 see page 19 of imperial oils 2012 summary

construction of on site water storage facilities 14 14 according to the alberta energy regulator s oil sands and coal exploration application guide https www aer ca documents manuals manual008 pdf accessed on january 11 2020 3 model description we analyze the case of a hypothetical oil sands firm in the lower athabasca river region we assume the operation is large enough that a single water storage pond will serve only one operation the decision model is based on the one developed in 11 however the current model includes the constraint on water withdrawals which follows a poisson process includes water inventory as an additional state variable and includes the decision to construct storage as an optimal control 3 1 oil production and water usage we assume that the firm is already producing bitumen from its oil sands development and that there is a fixed oil to water ratio accordingly we assume a linear production function 1 q w p t t η w p t η 0 w p t 0 0 q w p t t q where q is output η is a constant indicating the number of barrels of bitumen that can be produced using one barrel of fresh water w p t is the water used in production at time t and q is a fixed upper limit on the rate of production with no water management regulations the firm can produce up to its full capacity by using water without any restriction in the presence of the framework in the absence of water storage capacity the firm has to cut back production during the yellow and red zones in which case profits will be impaired the firm has the option to install a water storage facility the inventory of water in storage i will be augmented by water withdrawals from the river w w and reduced by w p as water is drawn out of storage for use in oil production the change in water inventory is given by the following differential equation 2 d i w w t w p t d t the level of the water inventory in storage is constrained to be a positive number which is less than the storage capacity i max t 0 refers to time zero or the starting time for the analysis 3 i t i t 0 t 0 t w w t w p t d t 0 i t 0 ι 0 0 i t i max 3 2 water withdrawals from the river according to the framework a weekly constraint on fresh water withdrawals is set for the oil sands industry and the restricted cumulative withdrawal in the yellow and red conditions is allocated among five oil sands firms roughly evenly the rate of water withdrawal w w is restricted to be no greater than w where w w 1 w 2 w 3 the subscripts k 1 2 3 represent the river flow condition or water zone where k 1 is the green zone k 2 is the yellow zone and k 3 is the red zone it is assumed that the change of water constraint from the current zone k to another u can be described by a stochastic differential equation 4 d w u 1 3 w u t w k t d x k u k 1 2 3 where d x k u is a poisson process 5 d x k u 1 with probability λ k u d t 0 with probability 1 λ k u d t k 1 2 3 u 1 2 3 the poisson process is intended to reflect the natural variability in river flows we assume that the risk of uncertain water flows is not correlated with the economy and the stock market therefore it is a diversifiable risk and the real or p measure can be used to model d x 15 15 see 35 for an introductory discussion of the real or p measure versus the risk neutral or q björk 36 provides an advanced treatment 3 3 oil resource stock production depletes the resource stock s 6 d s q w p t t d t s t 0 s 0 given 7 t 0 t q w p t t d t s t 0 where s t 0 is the level of available oil reserves at t 0 t 0 is starting time and t is the lease end date 3 4 project stages to investigate the investment behavior of this firm five project stages are considered in stage 1 there is no water storage facility and the firm holds the option to suspend production stage 2 or to move on to stage 3 in which the water storage facility is installed and put into use with the presence of the water storage facility the firm can choose to stay in stage 3 or suspend the production temporarily stage 4 the final stage stage 5 is the permanent abandonment of the project when in stages 1 to 4 the firm can decide to abandon switching to stage 5 by paying an abandonment cost let δ m be the notation for each stage where m stands for the sequence number of stages and m 1 m in this study m 5 stages are summarized in the following table stage δ description 1 producing oil no storage 2 suspended no storage 3 producing oil storage installed 4 suspended storage installed 5 permanently abandoned 3 5 oil prices there is a substantial existing literature examining alternative models for stochastic resource prices seminal papers include 37 40 the best model choice depends on the context in which it will be used for this paper we desire a parsimonious model that provides a reasonable depiction of the behavior of oil prices but does not involve additional stochastic factors which unnecessarily complicate the solution of the hjb equation huang 41 provides a detailed examination of several alternative models of oil price dynamics for this paper the analysis is undertaken using a simple log mean reverting model the assumed stochastic differential equation describing oil prices under the q measure i e the risk neutral measure is given as follows 8 d p ε μ ln p t p t d t σ p t d z where p t is the crude oil spot price at time t in u s μ is the long run mean log price that ln p t tends to ε is the speed of the mean reversion σ is the volatility and d z is the increment of a wiener process ε μ ln p t p t and σ p t are called the drift term and the volatility term respectively d z and d x k u defined in eq 5 are assumed to be independent of each other 3 6 cash flows annual cash flows are derived from revenue from the production and sale of oil reserves less fixed variable costs and taxes both revenues and costs depend on the stage of operation whether the project is operating temporarily suspended or permanently abandoned at time t the realized profits will be 9 π p t s t w t i t δ t p t ρ c v e o c v n e o 1 δ 1 3 η w p p t s t w t i t δ t oil sales revenue c f o 1 δ 1 3 c s 1 δ 1 2 3 4 oil production costs c f s c v s i 1 δ 3 4 water storage costs λ p t δ t 1 δ 1 2 3 4 taxes where 1 δ δ m is the indicator function which equals one if δ δ m and zero otherwise ρ is the discount of bitumen prices against wti prices and λ is the sum of all applicable taxes the c s denote various fixed and variable costs for oil production and water storage and are listed in table 2 total taxes include three elements λ carbon tax royalty income tax calculated as shown in table 1 in addition to annual cash flows there are one time costs incurred to move from one stage to another to go from an operating stage without storage to one with storage the cost of constructing storage facilities must be incurred which we denote as c to switch from an operating stage to a suspended stage the mothball cost c m is incurred to move back from a suspended stage to an operating stage the reactivating cost c r e is incurred similarly to move from any stage to permanent abandonment an abandonment cost c r is incurred we also assume that it is not possible to move from a stage with water storage back to a stage without water storage or move from permanent abandonment back to any other stage this is implemented by setting the costs to these relevant stage switches as a very large number c l a r g e table 2 summarizes the costs incurred in or between stages 4 specification of the decision problem the firm s objective is to maximize the expected present value of cash flows from its oil sands operation over t years there are three control variables water withdrawals w w from the river oil production q which determines the water used in production w p and the decision to switch project stages which we denote δ control variables depend on five state variables the oil price p the resource stock s the water withdrawal limit w the water inventory in storage i and the project stage δ 4 1 admissible sets for control variables admissible sets are now specified for the control variables let z δ denote the admissible set for δ where 10 z δ δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 δ 5 the admissible set for oil production q depends on the resource stock water storage inventory project stage and water withdrawals from the river denote this admissible set as z q s i δ w w which is given as follows 11a q z q s i δ w w 11b z q 0 min s q η w w if s 0 δ δ 1 11c z q 0 min s q η w w i if s 0 δ δ 3 11d z q 0 if s 0 δ δ m m 1 3 11e z q 0 if δ δ m m 2 4 5 s eq 11b states that in stage δ 1 oil production is constrained by the stock of oil reserves the maximum oil production limit and the amount of water withdrawn from the river multiplied by the water productivity coefficient in stage 3 described in eq 11c water from the existing storage inventory is added to water withdrawals from the river as a constraint on water available for oil production define an admissible set for water withdrawals w w denoted z w w δ as follows 12 w w z w w δ z w 0 w 1 if w w 1 δ δ 1 δ 3 z w 0 w 2 if w w 2 δ δ 1 δ 3 z w 0 w 3 if w w 3 δ δ 1 δ 3 z w 0 if δ δ 2 δ 4 δ 5 4 2 optimal controls and value function it is assumed that at predetermined fixed times the firm makes a decision about whether to change to a different project stage these fixed times are denoted by t d 13 t d t 0 0 t 1 t m t m t the firm can switch stages instantaneously at t t d and may incur a switching cost in doing so at time t the project must be terminated and clean up costs are incurred in the numerical example in this paper the time between fixed decisions dates is set as one week choices regarding the rate of water withdrawal w w and oil production q are made in continuous time in time intervals given as follows 14 t c t 0 t 1 t m 1 t m t m t controls are specified as functions of state variables as follows q p s w i δ t w w p s w i δ t t t c δ p s w i δ t t t d let k denote the set of particular choices for the controls for all t m 15 k δ t t d q w w t t c for any particular k the value function v p s w ι δ t can be written as the expected discounted value of the integral of future cash flows with the expectation taken over the controls given the state variables where p s w ι δ denote particular realizations of the state variables p s w i and δ 16 v p s w ι δ

expectation is taken under the risk neutral or q measure in our numerical example the value in the final time period v p t s t w t i t δ t t is assumed to be the cost of clean up if the project had not been abandoned before t δ δ m m 1 2 3 4 or is equal to zero if the firm has already abandoned the project δ δ 5 eq 16 is solved for the optimal controls contained in the admissible sets eqs 10 11e and 12 and subject to equations for d s d w d i and d p 6 4 2 and 8 a dynamic programming algorithm is implemented solving backwards in time and proceeding in two phases 1 the decision to switch stages made at fixed time points t m and 2 the choice of water withdrawals and oil production made in continuous time in the interval t t m t m 1 where t m denotes the instant after t m and t m 1 denotes the instant before time t m 1 4 3 solution at fixed decision dates at any t m t d the firm chooses the optimal stage t m at which the project value minus any switching cost is at a maximum other things equal 17 δ p s w ι δ t m arg max δ v p s w ι δ t m c δ δ where c δ δ denotes the cost for switching from stage δ at time t m to stage δ at time t m table 3 specifies c δ δ at the intersection of δ th row and the δ th column c large indicates an arbitrarily large number which prevents switching between two particular stages for example c 3 1 c large indicating that the firm cannot switch from stage 3 when storage has been installed to stage 1 prior to storage having been installed 4 4 solution between fixed decision dates going backward in time from t m 1 to t m in this section we describe the solution going backwards in time between decision dates i e t m 1 t m define the differential operator l as follows 18 l v 1 2 b 2 2 v p 2 a v p q v s w w w p v i u 1 u k 3 λ k

applying ito s lemma 16 16 see 36 for a rigorous overview of optimal decisions under uncertainty characterized by an ito process in a finance context 42 provides an introductory overview the value

is implemented using a fully implicit discretization scheme with semi lagrangian time stepping 17 17 a number of papers 43 45 introduce the method for solving stochastic optimal control problems more details can be found in these 46 and 47 the details and tests for the accuracy of the numerical solution are provided in the appendices of huang 41 5 specification of the parameters 5 1 oil prices the discount rate and exchange rate eq 8 was estimated in the risk neutral measure using futures contract prices on west texas intermediate crude oil data used was for contracts of less than one month to 17 months from january 1995 to december 2016 the data were deflated by the u s consumer price index so that eq 8 describes real oil prices the details of the estimation procedure are described in 41 the estimates obtained are ε 0 14 speed of mean reversion μ 4 59 long run log mean price σ 0 31 volatility this estimated model provides a good description of the data with in sample forecast errors of futures prices ranging from 0 6 to 1 6 depending on the contract length 41 fig 2 a shows the mean median and 5th and 95th percentiles for 100 000 simulations of the price model assuming an initial starting price of 80 per barrel we observe a wide range between the 5th and 95th percentiles which reflects the quite large volatility term recall that this is in the risk neutral measure so it reflects a risk premium demanded by market participants to invest in oil linked assets for reference historical wti prices since 2007 deflated by the u s cpi are shown in fig 2 b more recently the world oil price has been negatively affected by short term the covid 19 pandemic and long term events increased pressures to reduce fossil fuel use to see how an outlook for a lower oil price in the long run would affect our results we examined a pessimistic price sensitivity with μ 3 69 implying a long run mean price of u s 40 per barrel in section 6 results are described for the base case and also for the pessimistic price sensitivity when there are significant differences with the base case with regard to the discount of bitumen prices against wti prices ρ see eq 9 as in 11 we fix it at the level of 83 in other words we fix the oil sands price in canadian dollars at 83 of the wti price in us dollars in reality the bitumen price discount is highly variable and could itself be modeled as a second stochastic factor the real risk free interest rate is set at 2 percent the values of oil sands operation are expressed in us using an c us exchange rate of 0 85 5 2 production capacity reserves and water use intensity we choose a hypothetical plant with a production capacity of 240 000 barrels day which is similar in size to syncrude s aurora north project 18 18 48 49 it is further assumed that the resource base is 880 million barrels which implies that with extraction at full capacity the reserves would be exhausted after 10 years it is assumed that there are 10 years remaining in the firm s lease with the alberta government allowing bitumen extractions from the site sensitivities are conducted for different remaining lease lengths up to 30 years water conservation has been a focus of oil sands firms for the past decade data from the aer shows that from 2015 to 2019 water use intensity varied by firm and over time ranging from 1 1 to 4 0 barrels of water per barrel of oil with an average over all firms of 2 41 in 2015 and 2 18 in 2019 19 19 these numbers reflect water use intensity defined as the quantity of non saline water that is make up water meaning it is extracted from new sources rather than being recycled water source alberta energy regulator website water use performance oil sands mining accessed january 11 2020 and 50 water use intensity varies due to factors such as the stage of operations production targets and processes used to separate bitumen from oil sands for our hypothetical oil sands project we adopt syncrude s 2019 water use intensity level of 3 01 barrels of water barrel of oil therefore η 1 3 01 0 33 given our assumed production capacity of 240 000 barrels day this implies water demand of 722 400 barrels per day 5 06 million barrels per week 5 3 water withdrawal limits the alberta s phase 1 framework sets rules for determining water withdrawal limits in different zones and also explicitly lists for each week how many cubic meters of water per second the oil sands industry is permitted to remove from the athabasca river in the yellow and red zones based on the historical flow record up to 2007 the weekly water limits in the yellow and red zones for the entire oil sands industry are depicted in fig 3 as mentioned the permitted water withdrawal during the yellow and the red zones is allocated almost evenly among the oil sands operators with active projects according to the water sharing agreement we assume that the allocation is exactly even among active operators note that some operators have more than one mine and determine how their water allocation is divided across their different mines based on five active operators in 2015 the resulting specific weekly water assigned to a firm is listed in table 4 each firm s lowest weekly available water is 7 7 million barrels for the red zone and 10 6 million barrels for the yellow zone as noted the hypothetical oil sands mine is of similar capacity to syncrude s aurora facility syncrude operates the mildred lake and aurora mines which together have a production capacity of about 791 000 barrels per day 20 20 48 and 50 alberta mineable oil sands plant statistics monthly supplement december 2015 and 2019 we assume the hypothetical oil sands mine is part of an operation similar to syncrude s in scale and is allocated water based on its share of production aurora s production represents about 60 of the total from mildred lake and aurora combined 50 hence we assume the hypothetical mine has a weekly water allocation of 4 6 and 6 3 million barrels in the red and yellow zones respectively the hypothetical mine requires 5 06 million barrels of water per week and hence the restrictions would be binding in the red zone but not the yellow zone the parameter λ k u d t in eq 5 refers to the hazard rate which is the instantaneous probability of switching from river flow zone k to u in the period of d t historical data of athabasca river flows indicates that in recent years the river flows are lower compared to the average historical level for illustrative purposes we adopt the relatively low river flows condition of 2015 for estimating the hazard rates based on data from alberta environment for 2015 river flows we calculate average values for λ i j for all i 1 2 3 and j 1 2 3 where 1 corresponds to the green zone 2 the yellow zone and 3 the red zone as follows λ i j n i j n i 1 d t where n i is the number of weeks in 2015 that are in the zone specified by i n i j is the number of times that the zone switches from i to j in 2015 and d t is 1 week the resulting hazard rate matrix is as follows 40 7 11 3 0 12 2 36 7 3 1 0 4 3 47 7 where the entry at the i th row and the j th column stands for λ i j for example λ 12 11 3 implies that over one week the probability of switching from the green zone to the yellow zone is λ 12 d t 11 3 1 52 22 5 4 storage and production costs the last five years have witnessed significant decreases in the cost of oil sands production a recent alberta government document states that in response to the collapse of oil prices in 2014 oil sands operators adjusted to a lower price environment by new efficiencies and technological advances 51 resulting in significant reductions in operating costs and sustaining capital costs operating costs for oil sands mining are reported to have declined from c 34 9 to c 27 per barrel while sustaining capital costs declined from 6 to 3 8 per barrel between 2014 and 2018 for this study assumptions for the operating and sustaining capital costs of oil sands facilities are based on estimates provided by the canadian energy research institute ceri 52 appropriately scaled for the size of the hypothetical project in light of cost reductions since 2015 the ceri estimated costs were reduced by 30 the resulting costs are given in table 5 for energy and non energy variable costs fixed operating costs sustaining capital costs and abandonment costs 21 21 note that abandonment costs are assumed to be 2 of the original capital costs for the oil sands facility estimated at 17 billion using the 30 cost reduction factor abandonment costs are set at 238 million where all of these costs are 70 of values estimated in 52 we will comment on the effects of these cost reductions in section 6 5 about 80 percent of the water used in oil sands is recycled 53 the alberta government has maintained a zero discharge policy meaning that all oil sands process water must be contained on site in tailings storage facilities and no releases into the environment are permitted the buildup of large volumes of waste water in tailing ponds has caused the alberta government to consider allowing limited releases of liquid waste into the athabasca river provided the wastewater has been treated 54 while the cost of maintaining tailings ponds is included as part of capital and operating costs there is no consideration given in this paper to the potential costs of water treatment information on water storage capacity was obtained from imperial oil s description of their kearl oil sands project which commenced production on april 27 2013 22 22 source information provided on the website of imperial oil http www imperialoil ca canada english operations sands kearl environment aspx accessed on january 11 2020 like the kearl project it is assumed that storage can sustain 30 days production during the dry season which implies a water storage capacity of about 24 million barrels a report of 55 showed that the capital cost for fresh water storage is c 16 m 3 and the annual operating costs for the storage is 5 of capital cost plus relevant power costs the assumed capacity of our water storage i max is 24 million barrels or 2 87 cubic meters which implies a capital cost of c 46 million applying the cost reduction factor gives a capital cost c of c 32 million and the fixed cost of running the facility c f s of c 1 6 million year in the absence of publicly available information it is assumed that the variable cost of operating the storage capacity c v s is c 0 0024 barrel it is further assumed that the construction of the storage pond can be accomplished instantaneously table 5 details the parameter value assumptions for the hypothetical project in the base case including cost assumptions noted above as well as the carbon tax royalty rates 23 23 the royalty rate differs between the pre payout and the post payout phases of a project before the point that a project s cumulative revenues start to cover its cumulative costs it is in the pre payout phase after this point it is in the post payout phase without altering the qualitative results of our research we assume that the studied project is in the pre payout phase exchange rate and risk free interest rate 6 results we examine four different scenarios to highlight the impact of different river conditions and the strictness of water withdrawal limits regarding the former we contrast results with river conditions as they were in 2015 the wetter scenario with a drier scenario in which the river is always in the red zone fig 4 shows the two examined river flow conditions with a box plot of historical weekly river flows the boxplots indicate the first quartile represented by the lower edge of each box the third quartile the upper edge of each box the median the short horizontal bar cutting through each box the maximum level the highest tip of the dashed whisker the minimum level the lowest tip of the dashed whisker and outliers the plus signs of the historical weekly river flow rate we observe that 2015 was drier than the historical record for flow levels while red zone flow levels are even drier both the wetter and drier river conditions are examined using i phase 1 restrictions and ii stricter regulations in which withdrawals in the red and yellow zones are tightened by 1 35 million barrels per week which represents up to 30 and 42 of the weekly withdrawal limit respectively we summarize the four scenarios in table 6 6 1 the firm with no storage option water regulations will have the largest impact when the firm has no technological option available to alleviate water shortages note also that a reliance on water storage has been the subject of controversy due to potential negative environmental consequences as discussed in 57 fig 5 depicts the solution surface for w l which shows the project s values at time zero 24 24 at time zero there are still 10 years left until the oil extraction lease expires corresponding to different combinations of the oil sands resource stock and crude oil price when the present i e time zero river flow condition is in the green zone this graph depicts project value for different values of the state variables assuming the project owner acts optimally in the choice of controls until the lease end date at time t as expected other things equal the project s value rises with an increase in oil price as well as with an increase in resource stock when the present time zero river flow condition is in either of the other zones the shape of the solution surface is very similar to that in fig 5 and hence additional scenarios are not shown to compare the project values across the four scenarios fig 6 shows the present value of the project at time zero versus the oil price given the resource stock at the maximum level of 880 million barrels and the river is in the red zone the comparison is similar for other levels of reserves the upper set of curves depicts the base case scenarios and the lower set depicts the pessimistic oil price sensitivity for reference a case when there are no water restrictions is also shown referring first to the base case it may be observed that the stricter the water withdrawal limits or the drier the river flow condition the lower the project s value however in general the differences are small selected values are shown in table 7 where we observe that the values for the scenarios with lenient regulations w l and w s are very close to the values under no restrictions at all in addition with a time zero oil price of the 40 barrel the project s value is reduced by 329 million or 2 1 in w s compared to the scenario with no restrictions spread over the total reserves of 880 million barrels this amounts to 0 37 per barrel of oil reserves this difference is greater under dry river conditions project value under d s is 7 8 or 1224 million lower than under no restrictions which amounts to 1 39 per barrel of oil reserves we observe a similar pattern for the pessimistic oil price sensitivity but the relative differences are larger see table 10 in appendix b project abandonment will occur when reserves run out when the lease ends or when the oil price is so low that the firm is better off abandoning rather than maintaining an active mine abandonment requires the firm to pay rehabilitation costs but the firm thereby avoids the costs of the oil sands operation rather than abandoning the firm also has the option to suspend production but still incurs the large annual sustaining capital costs which at c 400 million exceed the abandonment cost of c 238 million the strictness of water withdrawal limits will affect a firm s decision about when to permanently abandon a project if water withdrawal restrictions become suddenly stricter such that the project value is negative then the optimal decision is to abandon the project immediately however if it remains optimal for the firm to continue the project the effect of stricter limits is not immediately obvious due to two opposing effects first stricter water restrictions imply reduced production in dry periods which the firm will try to make it up in wetter periods this might delay the abandonment time on the other hand stricter water restrictions reduce the value of the project which increases the probability of abandonment in the future we investigate this effect for our hypothetical project by examining critical prices to abandon the project if the oil price is greater than the critical price the firm s optimal choice is to continue the project otherwise it should shut down the project permanently a lower critical price for abandonment implies a longer expected time before abandonment table 8 lists the critical prices to abandon the project from the suspended state at time zero for the four scenarios and for different levels of oil reserves 25 25 for succinctness we do not show critical prices to abandon the project if in the operating state at higher reserve levels above 80 million barrels critical prices to temporarily suspend the project are always greater than or equal to critical prices to abandon the project from the operating state this implies for reserve levels above 80 the project will be suspended prior to abandonment the table shows critical prices of zero if remaining reserves are 200 million barrels or greater implying the project would never be abandoned at lower reserve levels abandonment is optimal for prices ranging from 5 to 20 per barrel overall there is little change in critical prices between strict and lenient regulations table 11 in appendix b shows critical prices for abandonment for the pessimistic price sensitivity there are higher critical prices for abandonment at some remaining reserve levels in the d s scenario compared to the d l scenario but overall the effect is small 6 2 option to install a water storage facility fig 7 compares project values with and without the option to install storage and table 9 provides some selected values as expected this option makes the project more valuable but the effect is only significant for the d s scenario where the value with the storage option exceeds that when there is no storage available by over 7 at both 40 or 100 per barrel for the time zero oil price for the other scenarios the percent differences are smaller 0 1 2 1 and 0 8 respectively for scenarios w l w s and d l at a time zero oil price of 100 barrel the increased value with storage available is relatively larger for the pessimistic price sensitivity i e 0 2 3 3 1 1 and 11 1 for w l w s d l and d s respectively see figure 13 in the appendix b it may also be observed from table 9 that the difference in project value between scenarios is tiny less than 1 note that the value with no restrictions is the same whether or not storage is installed storage only provides value to the firm when water restrictions are imposed given uncertain future oil prices and water restrictions the firm chooses the timing to install the water storage facility to optimize the present value of the project the critical prices to switch from stage 1 operating no storage to stage 3 operating with storage indicate the optimal strategy for the decision to invest in water storage if the crude oil price is greater than the critical price it is optimal to invest in storage otherwise the investment should be delayed the critical prices depend on the state variables including present river flow conditions as well as the resource stock level fig 8 depicts critical prices to proceed to stage 3 at different resource stock levels for the four scenarios it is observed that critical prices to install storage are much higher for low reserve levels implying that for smaller resource stocks or as reserves are depleted it is less likely to be optimal to make the investment in water storage critical prices are also significantly lower implying the firm is more likely to install storage when river conditions are drier comparing red and green zones and water restrictions are more severe d l and d s versus w l and w s respectively in section 6 1 it was observed that even without the option to install storage the critical prices for abandoning the project are fairly low and are not very sensitive to different scenarios when the option to install storage is available it will be even less likely that the project will be abandoned before the end of the lease at time t our results confirm this with critical prices for abandonment that are the same as or lower than when there is no storage option these critical price tables are not shown 6 3 the marginal cost of stricter water withdrawal constraints in this section we calculate the marginal costs of water withdrawal restrictions we define marginal cost to be the change in the expected value of the project to the firm at time zero caused by a marginal reduction in allowed water withdrawals in all future time periods this is a long run marginal cost in that it is assumed the firm will respond optimally to the change in water restrictions and may adopt new technology through the installation of storage the marginal cost estimate provides a lower limit for the marginal benefits needed in order for the regulation to be welfare enhancing the marginal cost also indicates a firm s willingness to pay for water and hence would be the price expected if a water trading scheme were implemented the marginal cost of increased restrictions depends on the value of the state variables we estimate the marginal cost of the restrictions to the hypothetical firm m c by taking the present value of the hypothetical firm v p s w ι δ t in a given river zone where w w at a specific oil price level p p at a certain oil stock level s s and finding the change in v p s w ι δ t when the permitted withdrawal rates in the yellow and red zones are further restricted by δ w 26 26 due to the accuracy of the numerical method the smallest marginal change that can be examined is 1 million barrels of water per week over the lifespan of the project the change in the firm s present value is in millions of dollars over the lifespan of the project i e t t 0 that is to say m c δ v p s w ι δ t δ w t t 0 the marginal cost of increased restrictions is mapped out for a range of initial water restrictions and shown in fig 9 below the figure is shown for an initial oil price of 50 per barrel and assuming the oil stock is at its maximum level the horizontal axis shows the adjustment of the level of available water for the oil sands mining sector with water constraint regulations becoming more strict in all future time periods moving from right to left the point labeled as 0 reflects the restrictions as in the phase 1 framework moving to the left 119 means that the water withdrawal limits in the red and yellow zones have been reduced by 2 3 million barrels each week or 119 million barrels each year compared to the phase 1 framework moving to the right 119 implies a comparable relaxing of restrictions for a given stage of operation in general it would be expected that the marginal cost of water restrictions would decline as restrictions become less onerous moving from left to right on the graph however the curve in fig 9 is non monotonic with several distinct regions this reflects the long run nature of the curve in which the option to install water storage affects the marginal cost further the storage installation represents a lumpy asset which cannot be acquired in small increments to interpret this graph it is helpful to consider each of four regions and observe the critical price to install storage in each region 237 and greater mc curve has a zero or negative slope critical prices to install storage are infinite indicating it is never optimal to install storage 119 to 237 mc curve is positively sloped critical prices to install storage are positive indicating it may be optimal to install storage at some future time if the price of oil exceeds the critical price 831 to 119 mc curve has zero or negative slope critical prices to install storage are below the time zero price of 50 barrel hence it is optimal to install storage immediately for further intuition we plot on the same graph the marginal cost curves for when there is no storage available blue dashed curve and when storage is freely available red dashed curve and hence is a free option which will always be exercised it can be seen that the marginal cost curve for the firm in stage 1 with the storage option falls between these two other cases we are unable to determine the efficient level of water restrictions as we do not have an estimate of the benefits to the ecosystem of an additional unit of water flowing in the river a hypothetical marginal benefit curve in shown in fig 9 indicating an efficient level of restrictions of about 500 million barrels relative to the phase 1 restrictions at point 0 the efficiency gain of moving from phase 1 to 500 is indicated by the blue shaded area in general the efficiency loss when the restrictions are not at the optimal levels depends on the slopes and locations of the marginal benefit curve and the marginal cost curve note that if the marginal benefit curve crossed the rising portion of the marginal cost curve then there would be no unique point where mb mc in this circumstance the total benefits and total costs would need to be examined for a range of restrictions to find the optimum the marginal cost of restrictions will depend on the state variables such as the oil price and the river conditions in particular fig 10 displays a marginal cost curves for different oil prices levels at time zero as well as the assumed marginal benefit curve it will be observed that different levels of the current oil price imply a different efficient water constraint a similar figure can be drawn for different river conditions at time zero this figure not shown indicates significantly higher marginal costs when in the dry river conditions it is impractical to change the level of water restrictions based on these changing states which shift the marginal cost curve however this highlights the fact that quantitative water restrictions have a varying cost for firms depending on current conditions which has implications for the efficiency consequences of the regulations 6 4 the effects of price volatility oil price volatility σ in eq 8 is of interest for at least two reasons first given that the current oil price has a significant impact on the marginal cost of restrictions it is worthwhile exploring the effect of the price volatility assumption on the marginal cost second asset price volatility is a much studied phenomenon in the investment under uncertainty literature it is well known that for a simple investment options an increase in volatility results in the delay of the investment 58 this section explores how an increase in volatility would affect the decision to install storage we compared the marginal cost and total cost of stricter water regulations for a variety of volatility assumptions in all scenarios the marginal and total costs of the regulations did not change substantially under different volatility assumptions for example when restrictions are set according to the phase 1 framework and time zero river conditions are in the red zone a doubling of σ from 0 9 to 1 8 reduced the marginal cost from 1 43 per barrel to 1 40 per barrel increasing volatility has several effects and whether the marginal cost will rise or fall depends on the case being examined an increase in volatility can increase the value of the oil producing asset as there will be more high price realizations which increases revenue while the effect of low price realizations is muted by the option to temporarily suspend operations on the other hand more restrictive water limitations reduce the ability of the firm to take advantage of high prices in this study the net effect at time zero of an increase in volatility is a slight reduction in the cost of restrictions to consider the effect of changing volatility on the decision to invest in storage fig 11 plots critical prices to install storage versus volatility for several scenarios looking first at the d s scenario in the red zone fig 11 a the critical prices are observed to fall as volatility increases implying that higher volatility results in an earlier investment in storage this contrasts to the result for simple investment options noted above intuitively in this scenario when water flows are reduced and water withdrawals are heavily constrained an increase in price volatility makes storage more valuable to the firm without storage and under binding water constraints the firm may not be able to take advantage of a sudden upswing in prices hence the more volatile prices increase the desirability of storage fig 11 b shows a similar effect for the w l scenario in the red zone for most of the reserve levels plotted however for w l in the green zone shown in fig 11 c critical prices as volatility rises in this scenario water withdrawals are only mildly constrained and hence increases in volatility tend to delay investment as per the normal effect of uncertainty figure 15 in appendix a shows the same information for the low price sensitivity again the impact of price volatility varies with the level of water restrictions 6 5 changing costs and water use intensity the cost of water regulations have changed over time as the oil sands industry has responded to economic pressures and environmental concerns as noted in section 5 4 there has been a significant decline in capital and operating costs since 2015 to investigate the effect of this improved efficiency we redid the numerical example using capital and operating costs as of 2015 which are 30 higher than those assumed for 2019 with higher costs the value of the oil sands operation is reduced by 7 15 depending on the oil price at time zero for the pessimistic price sensitivity the reduction in value ranges from 15 40 with higher costs impact of water restrictions is more evident for example the marginal cost of restrictions in the base case as depicted in fig 9 ranges from 0 for more lenient restrictions 119 on the horizontal axis to 0 25 million at the tightest restrictions 831 on the horizontal axis with 2015 costs the comparable portion of the marginal cost curve ranges from 0 to 0 42 million over the last two decades water productivity has improved as efforts have been made to increase water recycling although non saline water use also shows considerable variability from year to year as is indicated on the aer s website 59 the aer reports that between 2015 and 2019 syncrude s intensity of water use has ranged from 2 84 barrels water barrel of oil to 4 04 barrels water barrel of oil for our analysis we used the 2019 value of 3 01 for water intensity which gives η 0 33 when the intensity of water use is 2 5 barrels water barrel of oil or less we find that there is no need to invest in a water storage facility regardless of the river flow zone and there is no cost to the firm of the water restrictions fig 12 displays the marginal costs of restrictions under different water intensity assumptions 6 6 changing the lease end date t the base case assumption for the time remaining in the mining lease is ten years t 10 sensitivities were conducted for t extending to 30 years a longer lease length provides more flexibility to the oil sands firm in terms of the timing of extraction the firm can more easily adapt to unfavorable events such as water restrictions or low oil prices by postponing production to the future assuming t 30 years the total value of the project increases significantly however the qualitative conclusions regarding the impact of water restrictions are the same for example table 7 shows how project value declines under stricter water regulations given t 10 for t 30 the effect in percentage terms is somewhat less in particular when t 30 and there is no option to install storage project value in the w s scenario is 1 to 2 percent lower than the w l scenario while project value in the d s scenario is 4 to 5 percent lower that in the d l scenario the conclusion is unchanged that the relative cost of water restrictions is quite low the option to install storage increases project value but by a lesser amount in percent terms when t 30 for example at an initial oil price of 100 bbl in the d s scenario the option to add storage increases project value by about 4 percent compared to the 7 7 percent that was reported in section 6 2 for t 10 because the benefit of storage is reduced the critical prices that would induce a firm to invest in storage are increased 7 concluding comments this paper studies the cost of regulations designed to limit river water withdrawals by a large mining operation in order to protect surrounding ecosystems a stochastic optimal control approach is used to model the impact of these restrictions on firm profitability and to estimate the marginal cost to the firm of imposing stricter regulations the marginal cost estimates are an important input to regulatory design as they represent the shadow prices of water for the firm and may be considered as minimum values required for the environmental benefits to justify the regulation the methodology and conclusions from this analysis of a hypothetical oil sands mining operation can inform the assessment of regulations for other types of resource extraction projects some key observations and findings of this paper are summarized below estimates of the cost of regulations should be forward looking reflecting the change in firm value under different regulatory rules the analysis showed that the marginal cost of changing regulations depends critically on assumptions about key state variables such as future river conditions and the price of oil modeling the firm s decisions as a stochastic dynamic optimal control problem incorporates the uncertainty in both of these factors and demonstrates how the cost of regulations depends on a firm s optimal responses impact of investment in water storage technology the option to install storage reduces the marginal cost of restrictions this indicates the importance of considering potential technological investments in response to regulations low cost of the regulations alberta s phase 1 water management framework does not impose a large cost on firms given historical river flow conditions of the athabasca river the cost of restrictions has fallen since the regulations were first implemented as firms made investments to improve the efficiency of their operations the costs remain low even under assumptions of much drier conditions balancing the benefits and costs of regulations there is considerable uncertainty about how much water can be safely diverted from the river without harming the aquatic ecosystem given the low marginal cost estimates this analysis reveals that there is scope for adopting stricter regulations if there is a desire to provide added protection for in stream river flows impact of future oil prices an outlook for a lower long run average oil price increases the marginal cost of restrictions as a percent of mine value this is an important consideration given worldwide commitments to reduce oil consumption to limit carbon emissions which would put downward pressure on future oil prices non monotonic impact of increasing price volatility it is well known in the finance literature that for a simple investment option increased price volatility is likely to delay the optimal investment timing however we find that under very dry river conditions increased volatility can reduce the critical price required to install storage implying that the expected time for the investment is sooner as price volatility is increased high price realizations become more likely which increases the value of the ability to ramp up production making storage more valuable to the firm in contrast under more plentiful water conditions when water restrictions are less binding an increase in oil price volatility can delay the optimal investment in water storage as per the normal effect declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a boundary conditions boundary conditions must be established for the state variables t p s and i at t t if the project has not previously been abandoned reclamation costs will be paid of amount c r therefore v c r for δ δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 for δ δ 5 v 0 at t t as

8666,this paper investigates behavioral responses to a complicated and peculiar change in a municipality s water rate structure in 2006 the city of norman oklahoma water utility added a four dollar fixed fee reduced the number of block rate tiers and changed the rate structure from one that decreased and then increased across higher consumption block groups to a strictly increasing rate structure the changes in the volumetric rates were not uniform across the block rates customers at ultra low volumes of consumption faced a one penny reduction in their volumetric rate but experienced a large increase in total and average cost of water due to the addition of the relatively large fixed fee in contrast higher volume users faced a less severe increase in the total and average charge per gallon consumed to address the co determination of average water charge and consumption choice we estimate separate regressions for households grouped by pre price change demand and the block group of last gallon consumed using detailed monthly panel data for 23 408 residential water customers from 2002 to 2010 and a variety of model specifications our results highlight heterogeneous responses across consumption groups ultra low users responded to the price regime change by increasing consumption whereas higher volume users reduced consumption behavioral responses were found to be greater in the longer run than shorter run as expected keywords municipal water pricing increasing block rates conservation pricing short vs long run demand 1 introduction the impacts of climate change and population growth are putting municipal water supplies in a precarious situation 1 demand management through price and non price mechanisms are inexpensive and flexible complements to expensive supply oriented options 1 4 policies to handle droughts for example include temporary water price increases outdoor watering restrictions appeals for conservation and limits on withdrawals from stressed sources 5 increasing block rate ibr structures are widely used to encourage conservation over intermediate and longer run planning horizons under ibr the per unit or volumetric charge increases with consumption across a number of defined consumption ranges blocks according to the american water works association raftelis 6 the share of surveyed communities in the united states using an increasing block structure increased from 36 in 2006 to 50 in 2018 ibr structures are favored because they can be designed to address potentially conflicting goals of conservation equity and utility financing needs 7 12 an ibr structure can provide affordability for low and moderate volume users with low rates at low consumption ranges and incentivize conservation at higher volumes through increasing block rates 10 an ibr structure can also address cost recovery and revenue stability if average costs of providing water are increasing then volumetric rates which increase with consumption link marginal and average prices with marginal costs notably if high volume users reduce consumption in response to block rate increases or reduce consumption to stay within a given budget then a water utility could experience revenue shortfalls beecher 13 characterizes this as a conservation conundrum because effective conservation behavior could negatively impact water utility revenues the ability of an ibr design to address conservation revenue and distributional goals hinges on how heterogeneous customers respond to water pricing structures 10 14 estimating demand under non linear pricing structures is challenging standard economic theory suggests that customers should respond to the price of the next unit of water top block rate as well as the overall bill which reflects block rates and fixed fees do customers understand and respond to average price marginal price and or total bill brent and ward 15 conclude that consumers have poor knowledge of marginal price or total consumption but are aware of their total bills schleich and hillenbrand 16 wichman 17 and others conclude that customers respond to average prices under ibr water bills and consumption are co determined which complicates estimation of demand responses 18 19 preferences for water consumption are likely to be persistent and influenced by income and lifestyle choices simultaneously the consumption decision influences the total bill highest block rate and average price paid for instance a household which uses water primarily for indoor necessities would be in the low volume low marginal rate block in an ibr structure in contrast high volume users are likely to use water for outdoor luxury watering purposes whereas their total water bills are higher these individuals are likely to be wealthier which could lead them to be less responsive to both marginal and total cost increases compared with poorer households empirical evidence is mixed regarding whether high volume users are more or less responsive to price changes 17 20 21 unsurprisingly estimates of demand responses to ibr price structures vary widely and are influenced by demographic group region and estimation methodology 10 20 22 in this paper we investigate household demand responses to a peculiar change in the pricing of water in the city of norman oklahoma as described in table 1 the regime change was complex changing block ranges block rate structure and adding a 4 per month fixed fee the three lowest block ranges were condensed to two blocks and the rate structure flipped from decreasing with consumption to increasing the highest two block ranges stayed the same and the rates for both blocks were increased with the highest block rate remaining greater than lower block group rates the result was a pure ibr structure examining this unique regime change allows us to make several contributions to the literature the pricing change was not driven by a short run drought situation but rather by population driven demand growth and resulting need to expand infrastructure notably utility rates must be approved by norman voters which results in less frequent and larger size rate changes compared with utilities that do not have this requirement accordingly in contrast to most studies which consider small incremental price increases we investigate a large price increase at all levels of consumption the median household experienced more than a 60 increase in its water bill at its pre change level of consumption in addition norman s new price regime remained in effect for almost a decade allowing us to estimate longer run demand responses compared with similar regime change studies kenney et al 23 consider multiple switches between a uniform volumetric rate and an ibr structure during a five year drought period in aurora colorado nieswiadomy and molina 24 investigate the four years after a switch from a decreasing block structure to a two block ibr structure in denton texas we add to the few papers which focus on price responses of low volume users as well as the growing literature investigating heterogeneous response to water pricing the price regime shock had different impacts on the pricing for low and high volume users the addition of a fixed fee coupled with a one cent reduction in the lowest block rate led to a tripling of the water bills for the lowest volume users few papers address impacts on lower volume users in an ibr setting likely because price increases are typically designed to be small at the low end of consumption range 1 1 kenney et al 23 investigates small price change impacts on low volume users instead the research tends to focus on conservation behavior of high volume users who are impacted by higher block rates across the distribution as well as the addition of blocks at the top end of the ibr structure 17 25 our data is ideal it includes monthly residential water consumption records from 2002 to 2010 house and lot details billing cycle dates and neighborhood location which allows us to create localized billing cycle rainfall measures rainfall is a key factor we extend nieswiadomy and molina 24 sync city wide rainfall measures to the billing cycle to account for temporal variation in rainfall our measure accounts for local spatial variation by using measures from the nearest of 39 sensors located throughout the city of norman to address the challenges created by the co determination of price and consumption under ibr structures we estimate separate demand equations for households grouped by consumption volume prior to the price regime change following kenney 23 and wichman 17 2 2 see soliman 18 for a review of approaches to address the co determination problem we extend these by grouping households according to the block group corresponding to their last gallon of consumption which respects the rate structure boundaries and the unique price shock for each group despite the considerable interest in estimating heterogeneous responses to water price changes under different rate structures there is no clear guidance on how to model price signals 17 26 30 in our baseline estimates we use a dummy variable to reflect the post regime change and then back out elasticity estimates based on actual price changes that occurred for the median user in each block group this approach recognizes that each group is impacted by a unique rate structure shock and that the lowest block rate fell by a negligible amount one cent per 1000 gallons we also investigate other specifications found in the literature an instrumental variable approach using lagged volumetric charges and a fuzzy regression discontinuity design approach as expected we find heterogeneous responses to price regime change across the consumption distribution all except the ultra low volume households reduced consumption in the post price change period and displayed inelastic price elasticity of demand over the intermediate and long run the middle group which had the most households and largest predicted price responses contributed the most to overall conservation our results suggest that ibr can be used to address revenue and conservation needs 2 background 2 1 ibr policy a large and growing literature addresses the challenges of assessing the impact of ibr structures on consumer water demand 10 18 20 22 ideally researchers want to observe water rate changes accounting for other factors driving water use particularly weather local water management conditions and customer characteristics income property features etc data limitations are a major issue 31 few papers have sufficient data to allow for straightforward analysis of responses to water rate changes holding other factors constant researchers commonly use panel data in conjunction with fixed effects for year month and or customer depending on data availability 17 18 23 context and empirical approaches vary considerably across studies making out of sample projections difficult local water supply and demand conditions impact pricing policies for example cities with ample supply have less need to implement conservation pricing strategies in contrast cities which face rising production costs are attracted to ibr structures because they charge higher rates to higher volume users clearly past aggregate consumption trends may drive price capacity expansion needs leading to water price increases 32 residential water users are likely to be influenced by the policy change drivers as well public discussions about water supply conditions and policy responses can influence residential water demand decisions although ibr structures are designed to encourage conservation it is not clear if customers fully comprehend complex pricing signals when faced with non linear and multiple price components strong and goemans 33 refer to ibr as a penalty structure where payment occurs after consumption has occurred notably they find that real time information leads to increased water consumption which conflicts with conservation goals ibr can lead to increased consumption if individuals maximize utility by consuming up to the block boundary individuals below a boundary before an ibr is implemented or changed may respond to the change by increasing consumption 19 33 recent quasi experimental research investigates four possible regime change policy scenarios implementation of a new ibr structure from an existing non ibr scheme 17 33 modification of an ibr structure by adding new top block rates 20 25 and temporary transitions to and from irb systems 23 and an increase in rates across an established ibr structure while holding block ranges constant 24 we investigate a complex transition to an ibr structure a new fixed fee was introduced block ranges were altered and the structure changed from an unusual decreasing then increasing structure to a strictly ibr structure 2 2 norman s water rate structure background located on the southern edge of the oklahoma city metropolitan area the city of norman has an estimated population of 96 000 people in 2000 the city experienced rapid population growth starting in 1980 increasing 18 from 1980 to 1990 and another 19 2 from 1990 to 2000 3 3 us census bureau county and city data book 2000 34 norman s main water sources lake thunderbird and ground water wells were insufficient to meet growing demand in 2000 the city completed a connection with oklahoma city s utility to provide water on an emergency basis 35 the need to expand water capacity was apparent norman water utility managers are constrained in their ability to adjust water rates due to the passing of a 1974 initiative petition requiring voters to approve utility rate increases 4 4 the initiative petition was a backlash to the mayor using increased rates to pay for increased policing layden 36 voting on utility rates is unique in oklahoma but not uncommon across the united states as a consequence of the election requirement norman s utility rate increases occur less frequently and are of larger magnitude compared with utilities that have the authority to incrementally increase rates as needed the focus of our analysis is the impact of the water rate changes implemented as of may 2006 in the city of norman the previous rates had been in place since 1999 the 1999 rates were meant to promote water conservation among high volume residential users and pay for needed water supply expansions 37 the structure implemented in 1999 structure was unusual it kept declining rates over the first three blocks and added two blocks with increasing rates at higher volumes of consumption 38 5 5 we know exact locations of sensors but only the census tract for water customers households are assigned the rainfall measure matching the sensor in the same census tract if it contains a sensor or the closest tract if not the block ranges and rates are shown in table 1 the lowest two blocks ultra low and low each had a range of only 1 000 gallons of consumption per month with volumetric rates of 2 01 and 1 73 per gallon respectively the middle block ranged from 2 000 to 15 000 gallons with a volumetric rate of only 1 14 per gallon the high block ranged from 15 000 to 20 000 gallons with a rate of 2 00 the ultra high block had a rate of 4 double that of the next highest block the higher rates for the first few thousand gallons might be viewed as an alternative to having a fixed fee because all users pay the higher costs on the first few thousand gallons consumed in a month according to a 2004 u s congressional report 39 29 of customers used over 15 000 gallons per month in 1998 but as of 2003 only 11 of the customers fell into this excessive use range apparently the financial incentive curbed consumption for high volume users changes in epa regulations regarding maximum levels of arsenic resulted in the loss of 13 wells in norman s system 40 the city sought and received voter approval for a significant rate payer increase to cover costs to replace these wells and to upgrade the system the shift to a pure ibr structure included adding a fixed fee and changing the block ranges table 1 shows block ranges and volumetric rates corresponding to the price regimes in place from 1999 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2015 fig 1 provides a graphical representation the size of the change in the volumetric prices in each block range varied the ultra low block rate was reduced by one cent per thousand gallons all the other block rates were increased as follows 0 27 between 1 000 and 2 000 gallons 0 86 between 2 000 and 5 000 gallons 0 96 between 5 000 and 15 000 gallons 0 75 between 15 000 and 20 000 gallons and 0 95 over 20 000 gallons table 2 shows the total and average charges associated with the price structure in place before and after the 2006 rate change the percentage changes in the top block rate and total charges are calculated using a midpoint calculation the block groups are based on the pre regime change rate structure as illustrated in fig 2 the total charges increased for all volumes of consumption the ultra low group experienced a near tripling of the water charge which increased from 2 01 to 6 00 4 fixed fee plus 2 volumetric charge for 1 000 gallons of consumption the total charge for low group more than doubled for 2 000 gallons of consumption the increase in the total charge for the middle group ranged from 61 to 68 the block rates and total charges for the high and ultra high groups increased by smaller percentages fig 3 shows the average charge per thousand gallons of consumption for the two fee structures it highlights the dramatic increase in the average water cost for the first few gallons of consumption after the price change the changes in the block widths as well as the non uniform increase in the block rates highlight the importance of controlling for pre change consumption and block range structure when estimating demand responses 3 empirical specification 3 1 data we estimate demand responses to the 2006 water price change using micro level panel data spanning 2002 to 2010 the focus is on residential water customers which includes about 85 of the water utility customers in norman the city of norman gis staff graciously merged water bill records with information from 2014 property tax records from the cleveland county assessor office to preserve privacy we use daily rainfall measures from national weather service nws records following nieswiadomy and molina 24 daily records are aggregated to correspond to days covered in the household s billing cycle month our measure goes beyond city wide estimates by matching each house to the closest of 39 nws sensors located throughout norman 6 6 we thank the anonymous reviewer for suggesting that we explore this approach this makes our rainfall measure a key demand driver more accurate with regard to temporal and spatial dimensions compared with typical studies customers are grouped based on their average monthly consumption from january to december of 2005 the year prior to the price regime change this approach is similar to kenney et al 23 and wichman 17 who group customers by quartiles and deciles respectively rather than assigning households into evenly distributed groups we group households according to the block structure in the pre change period as described in table 1 this offers the advantage of not only controlling for persistent pre change water demand behavior but also accounts for the unique structure change impacting each group summary statistics for each group are given in table 3 the middle group includes the median volume consumer and has the greatest number of households 19 996 not surprisingly the ultra low group has only 270 customers the low group high group and ultra high groups have 1 014 1 287 and 841 customers respectively looking across the block groups we see a link between consumption and factors related to income as anticipated higher volume users live in larger newer homes with more bathrooms larger pools and larger outdoor pervious surface areas on average lower volume users have smaller older houses with fewer bathrooms consistent with lower income households this suggests heterogeneity in water consumption preferences across groups it also highlights the importance of accounting for group size when predicting system wide conservation impacts 3 2 demand estimation an extensive literature addresses how to estimate demand when pricing is non linear olmstead 41 discusses reduced form versus structural modelling approaches under block rate structures following previous studies 8 29 32 42 we estimate a straightforward demand equation using a log linear approach 1 c itj α j β 1 regime c h a n g e t β 2 rainfal l it β 3 h o u s e i γ m o n t h t ε it where cit j is the natural log of water consumption for household i in month t for consumption group j by estimating demand for each group separately we can avoid the complications of the nonlinear price scheme regime change t is dummy variable which is set equal to one for all months after may 2006 when the new price scheme was in effect each group will experience a unique change in average and marginal price scheme after the change rainfall it is the sum of monthly rainfall recorded at the closest weather sensor these are calculated to correspond to the billing cycle month it is well known that rainfall is an important driver of water consumption particularly in summer months housei is a time constant fixed effect for household i alternatively we could include a vector of non varying household characteristics market value total area of the house lot area pool area number of bathrooms and year built for the year 2014 estimates with the detailed house variables are qualitatively similar these are not shown for brevity month t is a set of month dummy variables used to account for seasonal variation we focus on the months surrounding the price changes march september as these are the peak consumption months when conservation is most valuable εit are white standard errors homes with less than 100 gallons of charged consumption are eliminated to account for unoccupied homes and possible billing errors the sample is limited to homes built before 2006 the final sample includes 23 408 residential households 4 results 4 1 baseline estimates estimates corresponding to equation 1 are given in table 4 each column corresponds to the estimation of equation 1 for each block group heterogeneous responses to the price regime change are evident consistent with previous research all estimated coefficients on the regime change variable are significant at the 1 level except for the ultra low group the estimated regime change impacts were negative as expected with conservation pricing the estimated regime change impacts were similar in size for the upper three block groups ranging from 11 5 for the ultra high group to 13 for the middle group the low group has a much smaller estimated response in the post change period 4 6 taken at the group means for march september 2005 consumption the predicted reduction in monthly consumption is 73 gallons 929 gallons 2 134 gallons and 3 123 gallons for the low middle high and ultra high groups respectively for the ultra low volume group the estimated positive regime change coefficient is unexpected the estimated 11 6 change equates to 69 gallons a month based on average march september consumption in 2005 in the behavioral literature which investigates social messaging strategies boomerang effects are noted a boomerang effect occurs when low volume users increase their consumption after being made aware of their relatively low usage compared with their neighbors or other anchor group 43 in our scenario the election requirement provides a mechanism by which individuals are provided information attached to water bills and are primed to assess their own consumption through election brochures and community presentations an individual could learn if her usage is low relative to the average residential customer in the community potential psychological aspects could also be at play although these are relatively unexplored in the literature 44 the unexpected increase in water consumption could reflect a reaction to the addition of the fixed base fee leading customers want to get their money s worth by consuming more the water pricing structure seems to impact demand as reynaud et al 45 find the estimates of rainfall impacts are also notable estimated sensitivity to localized rainfall during the billing cycle increases across block groups for the ultra high group the estimated impact is a 0 8 reduction in monthly consumption for each additional centimeter of rainfall per billing cycle higher volume users are expected to be more sensitive to rainfall given that their use includes outdoor water the estimated impacts of rainfall are consistent with the literature and the predictions of water utility managers we investigate several alternative specifications to check the robustness of our baseline estimates 4 2 adding year fixed effects we extend the specification given in equation 1 by adding a set of year dummy variables to capture other contextual factors driving water demand which are not explicitly included in the model results are shown in table 5 the general pattern of heterogeneous responses across the groups remains the estimated regime change coefficients for the ultra low high and ultra high groups are amplified going from 11 6 to 28 6 12 4 to 15 and 11 5 to 20 3 for each group respectively in contrast the estimated regime change impact for the middle falls to 1 3 the estimated sign of the regime change impact for the low group switches from small negative 4 6 to non negligible positive value 11 5 this group is small there is some concern about adding year dummies as changes in attitudes and water policies are likely to be influenced by monthly weather patterns which are accounted for in the model recall our rainfall variable is fairly accurate and localized it is linked to both neighborhood and billing cycle 4 3 investigating alternate panel lengths we also investigate different panel lengths yoo et al 46 characterizes two year impacts as short run and an eight year time span as long run accordingly our baseline estimates can be viewed as intermediate or long run impacts see worthington hoffman 47 for a survey of short and long run elasticity estimates conventionally long run responses are expected to be greater than short run elasticities due to substitutability 46 48 table 6 shows estimates of the regime change coefficients corresponding to equation 1 using different panel lengths the first row repeats the baseline estimates for the 2002 to 2010 period shown in table 4 the second and third correspond to 2002 to 2009 and 2002 to 2008 periods respectively all of the estimated regime change coefficients retain the same signs and remain significant at the 1 level the coefficients on middle 10 3 and 8 4 high 8 and 5 8 ultra high groups 6 2 and 3 7 groups demonstrate similar trends and relative responses across groups the groups respond by conserving more over the longer period as expected over time high volume customers can adapt to higher prices by investing in sprinkler systems and other water saving devices 49 50 for the low group the shorter and longer run responses are nearly identical recall this group likely uses water primarily for indoor uses and is likely to spend a larger share of income on water costs the ultra low group displays larger positive responses in the longer run their water use is minimal with little room for reductions assuming they live in town during the summer months this result could reflect mean reversion if some of the households placed in this group were away in the pre regime change period 7 7 we do not present the ultra low specification results in table 7 because there is only a negligible change in the volumetric price for this group as expected we find that lag ave cvp was not significantly related to demand for the ultra low group it could also reflect learning and responding to the imposition of the fixed fee increasing consumption lowers the average price per unit consumed 4 4 specifications with price variables a common approach to estimating water demand uses the lagged value of average price or an instrumented value of the lagged average price to capture responses to price changes 23 29 30 we explore this approach but note its important limitations notably price variables are based on charged prices on water bills which reflect the price structure and consumption choice in our analysis changes in charged prices in the pre and post regime change periods reflect non price factors thus the estimated coefficients on the lag of the price variable reflect responses to past consumption choices rather than price changes in the pre period and reflect possible changes in responses to the price change in the post regime change period we present the results using instrumented values of the average charged volumetric price ave cvp expressed in log value given persistence of preferences for water usage and water use behavior we would expect specifications using the lag values and the instrumented lag values to yield similar results especially in specifications that account for weather during the billing cycle and month which is what we find our approach is similar to kenney et al 23 in the first stage ave cvp for a household is estimated as a function of all the block rates rainfall water meter route month year dummy variables and detailed housing features in 2014 including market value total area of the house pervious surface area pool area number of bathrooms and year built in the second stage monthly average consumption is estimated by adding the lagged value of predicted lag ave cvp and its interaction with the regime change variable to the right hand side of equation 1 this specification attempts to distinguish between the impact of the changes volumetric prices from the addition of the fixed fee and other non price aspects captured by the regime change variable notably households might have modified water demand behavior due to the increased awareness and education surrounding the water rate election further note that estimating consumption groups separately means that the estimated price variables represent impacts within those groups accounting for the factors which led to the group assignment in the first place finally the estimated coefficient for lag ave cvp represents an immediate response to last month s consumption which determines the average volumetric charge the results for each group which experienced block rate changes are shown in table 7 8 8 these results are not shown for brevity as expected the estimated regime change coefficients remain negative for the low middle high and ultra high groups 6 6 16 2 18 and 9 2 respectively the estimated lag ave cvp coefficients are close to zero and only the estimates for the middle group is statistically significant this is expected given that the middle group is large and includes a wide range of consumption compared to the other groups the estimated interaction coefficients lag ave cvp x regime change are positive and significant for the middle and high groups to understand the behavioral response in the post period we need to consider the combined effect of the three variables using the mean values of ave cvp for each group the estimated change in consumption based on results in table 7 versus the benchmark estimates in table 4 regime change were as follows 0 053 versus 0 046 for the low group 0 142 versus 0 130 for the middle group 0 159 versus 0 124 for the high group and 0 108 versus 0 115 for the ultra high group the results for the ultra high group while still suggesting conservation behavior in the post change period contrasts those of the lower volume users lag ave cvp represents certain consumption choices which are predicted with detailed characteristics in the post regime change period there was time to adjust usage to the increased demands we also note the importance of including an accurate localized rainfall measure in this specification estimations omitting rainfall led to greater predicted responsiveness to lagged price as well as to the regime change variables 9 this is expected given that rainfall is a key driver of variation in monthly water consumption this highlights the value of using refined localized rainfall measures in similar specifications 4 5 exploiting discontinuities a direct way to tease out differential responses by groups to rate changes exploits the price discontinuities at the block boundaries we estimated a fuzzy regression discontinuity design frdd type approach similar to wichman 17 and nataraj and hanemann 25 the forcing variable is average consumption in the year before the rate change 2005 the assignment is imprecise fuzzy because being below the cutoff in the previous year does not guarantee that a household is below the cutoff after the price change we look at two cutoffs 15 000 the boundary between the middle and high groups and 20 000 the boundary between the high and ultra high groups the cutoffs are the points where the marginal and average prices diverge under the old and new rate schedules we include households whose consumption falls within 1 000 gallons of the boundary in 2005 the year before the rate changes thus the estimates include households consuming between 14 000 and 16 000 gallons for middle high specification and between 19 000 and 21 000 gallons for the higher ultra high specification we do not run the frdd analysis for the low and ultra low boundaries because these groups have ranges of only 1 000 gallons each the specifications follow the typical modelling approach the regime change variable reflects the change in the fixed fee that both groups experience the above boundary variable is set to one if the household is above the boundary the estimated coefficient is expected to be positive indicating that these households are defined to have higher consumption the interaction between above boundary and regime change indicates the impact of the difference in the changes in the top block rate for each group in the estimation a positive estimated coefficient indicates that households consuming just above the border amount responded more to the marginal rate change compared with those just below the boundary the first set of columns in table 8 investigate the middle high discontinuity the estimated regime change coefficient 9 9 is similar to the baseline estimates in table 4 the estimated above boundary coefficient 2 2 is positive as expected given group assignment the estimated coefficient for the above boundary interaction with regime change is 2 2 intuitively the positive sign makes sense because the middle group s top rate increased by 0 96 per unit compared with 0 75 for the high group the second set of columns in table 8 investigate the high ultra high discontinuity again the estimated coefficient for the regime change variable 13 3 is negative and significant again the estimated above boundary coefficient 5 7 is positive as expected the estimated coefficient for the above boundary interaction with the regime change 4 is negative which corresponds to the larger change in the ultra high rate 0 95 versus the high rate 0 75 these refined estimates suggest that the ultra high group was successfully targeted for a larger conservation response also the middle group showed the biggest response to the price regime change which is as expected given that the change increased the block rate for the middle block range the most 5 discussion 5 1 elasticity estimates demand responses are commonly discussed in terms of price elasticity of demand different approaches have been used in the literature to estimate water demand elasticities 20 in our case estimating elasticity using just the change in the top block rate would be misleading given the addition of a fixed fee in 2006 further the rate changes for the top block of consumption do not reflect the rates for consumption at lower volumes of consumption we calculate demand elasticities using the average price and the marginal top block rate using baseline estimates from table 4 average price elasticities make sense if customers respond to average price when price schemes are complex as in ibr structures 15 17 elasticity estimates shown in table 9 are calculated at the march september 2005 average level of consumption for each block group the total charge and top marginal rates before and after the price regime change are calculated the percentage changes in prices are estimated using the midpoint formula and the estimated percentage changes in consumption are represented by the coefficient estimates for regime change given in table 4 for the ultra low group the estimated marginal price elasticity of demand makes no sense given that the price regime change reduced the volumetric rate for this group by one cent the estimated average price elasticity is 0 09 for the ultra low group the estimated marginal price elasticities range from 0 22 for the middle group to 0 54 for the highest group estimates of average price elasticities are shown in the last column of table 9 as expected these are smaller than the marginal price elasticity ranging from 0 06 for the low group to 0 30 for the ultra high group notably we find no evidence that conservation led to revenues loss e g a conservation conundrum 13 as all demand responses are in the inelastic range and the high volume users conserved but not enough to negatively impact utility revenues previous elasticity estimates vary considerably by context and empirical approach see asci et al 20 yoo et al 46 piper and davis 51 worthington and hoffman 47 espey and espey 52 and dalhuisen et al 53 for discussions of the ranges of elasticities found in the literature agthe and billings 49 for instance find that high income groups use more water and are less responsive to price changes than lower income users using survey data mansur and olmstead 50 find that rich households with big lots have lower demand elasticities in absolute value for outdoor uses compared with poor households and vice versa for indoor watering uses in contrast kenney et al 23 find that higher volume users are more responsive to price interventions with estimated average price elasticities of 0 34 0 57 and 0 75 for the low middle and high users respectively setting the ultra low group aside our results align with kenney s but our estimated elasticities are somewhat smaller in absolute size wichman 17 estimates average price elasticities from 0 43 to 1 14 across decile groups using triple difference models with an estimate of 0 31 in the tightest bandwidth of the frdd specifications consistent with previous literature we find systematic differences in demand elasticities across consumption groups a finding of relevance for water utility managers when designing water rate structures 5 2 implications for overall conservation the implication for system wide conservation depends on the size of each group as well as the estimated response to the price regime change table 10 provides a simple calculation of the predicted conservation based on the estimated change in demand using the baseline estimates shown in table 4 and the sample sizes for each group as shown in table 3 the average ultra low group household is predicted to increase consumption by 69 gallons per month yielding an estimated 18 729 increase for the group as a whole the average low group household is predicted to decrease consumption by about 73 gallons per month leading to an estimated decrease of 74 164 gallons for the group combined the average household in the middle group is predicted to reduce consumption by 929 gallons per month this group is large constituting about 85 of the households in our data leading to a combined estimate of 18 6 million fewer gallons per month in comparison the average customer in the high group is predicted to reduce consumption by 2 133 gallons per month for an overall predicted reduction of 2 7 million gallons per month the average ultra high group customer is predicted to reduce consumption by a large amount 3 133 gallons per month for a combined reduction of 2 6 million for the group combined the estimated reduction in residential water use is 24 million gallons per month for the march through september months or about 168 million gallons for the seven months combined the ultra high household had the greatest predicted per household conservation which suggests that the change in the ibr structure was effective at encouraging conservation from the luxury user sector of the market the greatest source of overall conservation however came from the middle group which includes the most users accordingly knowing behavior of this group is key for meeting total conservation needs 6 conclusion when pricing water managers seek to balance multiple objectives including cost recovery conservation and equity we investigate a peculiar regime change in which an unusual block structure with volumetric rates that were decreasing at low volumes and increasing at higher volumes was converted to a standard ibr structure the lowest volume users faced a large bill increase driven by the addition of the fixed fee higher volume groups experienced increases in block rates in addition to the new fixed fee the price increases were large consistent with a policy environment where rate changes are infrequent due to the requirement that voters must approve rate changes our baseline estimates reflect longer run responses consistent with previous literature we find substantial heterogeneity in responsiveness to rate changes across user groups and between shorter and longer run periods the ultra low volume group responds to the introduction of the fixed fee by increasing consumption the election process might have informed them of their low usage relative to others in the community or this group might have increased consumption to get their money s worth for the fixed fee the other four groups responded to the price regime change by decreasing consumption as anticipated we note that low volume households are likely to be poorer a potential equity concern arises if price changes push poor households to reduce water consumption below basic necessity levels 10 we see little evidence that this occurs given the small predicted reductions in water consumption for the low volume group and the increase for the ultra low group our results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications found in the literature including using lagged charged volumetric price variables and fuzzy regression discontinuity estimation we confirm earlier research where the majority of customers those in the middle of the consumption distribution faced the greatest increase in their top block rate and had relative larger responses to price increases it is important for water utility managers to anticipate muted responses to conservation prices for the ultra high volume customers especially if the goal is to target conservation by customers using water for luxury uses further if households have heterogeneous willingness to pay for water then as mansur and olmstead 50 argue a price based approach has a theoretical advantage over restrictive policies such as water rationing during droughts our results must be interpreted with care we focus on march through september which includes peak summer months lyman 54 suggests that price elasticity of demand is more than twice as high in peak summer periods than off peak periods in addition the city of norman is unique in requiring local elections leading to long periods between utility rate elections and large discrete changes in water prices compared with communities that can change water utility rates administratively further the situation we investigate was not typical of changes associated with initial implementation or adjustments to ibr structures echoing sebri 22 and lu et al 10 we note that decision makers should take care in basing water utility policies on studies of different policy contexts and local conditions data statement data for this research are not publicly

8666,this paper investigates behavioral responses to a complicated and peculiar change in a municipality s water rate structure in 2006 the city of norman oklahoma water utility added a four dollar fixed fee reduced the number of block rate tiers and changed the rate structure from one that decreased and then increased across higher consumption block groups to a strictly increasing rate structure the changes in the volumetric rates were not uniform across the block rates customers at ultra low volumes of consumption faced a one penny reduction in their volumetric rate but experienced a large increase in total and average cost of water due to the addition of the relatively large fixed fee in contrast higher volume users faced a less severe increase in the total and average charge per gallon consumed to address the co determination of average water charge and consumption choice we estimate separate regressions for households grouped by pre price change demand and the block group of last gallon consumed using detailed monthly panel data for 23 408 residential water customers from 2002 to 2010 and a variety of model specifications our results highlight heterogeneous responses across consumption groups ultra low users responded to the price regime change by increasing consumption whereas higher volume users reduced consumption behavioral responses were found to be greater in the longer run than shorter run as expected keywords municipal water pricing increasing block rates conservation pricing short vs long run demand 1 introduction the impacts of climate change and population growth are putting municipal water supplies in a precarious situation 1 demand management through price and non price mechanisms are inexpensive and flexible complements to expensive supply oriented options 1 4 policies to handle droughts for example include temporary water price increases outdoor watering restrictions appeals for conservation and limits on withdrawals from stressed sources 5 increasing block rate ibr structures are widely used to encourage conservation over intermediate and longer run planning horizons under ibr the per unit or volumetric charge increases with consumption across a number of defined consumption ranges blocks according to the american water works association raftelis 6 the share of surveyed communities in the united states using an increasing block structure increased from 36 in 2006 to 50 in 2018 ibr structures are favored because they can be designed to address potentially conflicting goals of conservation equity and utility financing needs 7 12 an ibr structure can provide affordability for low and moderate volume users with low rates at low consumption ranges and incentivize conservation at higher volumes through increasing block rates 10 an ibr structure can also address cost recovery and revenue stability if average costs of providing water are increasing then volumetric rates which increase with consumption link marginal and average prices with marginal costs notably if high volume users reduce consumption in response to block rate increases or reduce consumption to stay within a given budget then a water utility could experience revenue shortfalls beecher 13 characterizes this as a conservation conundrum because effective conservation behavior could negatively impact water utility revenues the ability of an ibr design to address conservation revenue and distributional goals hinges on how heterogeneous customers respond to water pricing structures 10 14 estimating demand under non linear pricing structures is challenging standard economic theory suggests that customers should respond to the price of the next unit of water top block rate as well as the overall bill which reflects block rates and fixed fees do customers understand and respond to average price marginal price and or total bill brent and ward 15 conclude that consumers have poor knowledge of marginal price or total consumption but are aware of their total bills schleich and hillenbrand 16 wichman 17 and others conclude that customers respond to average prices under ibr water bills and consumption are co determined which complicates estimation of demand responses 18 19 preferences for water consumption are likely to be persistent and influenced by income and lifestyle choices simultaneously the consumption decision influences the total bill highest block rate and average price paid for instance a household which uses water primarily for indoor necessities would be in the low volume low marginal rate block in an ibr structure in contrast high volume users are likely to use water for outdoor luxury watering purposes whereas their total water bills are higher these individuals are likely to be wealthier which could lead them to be less responsive to both marginal and total cost increases compared with poorer households empirical evidence is mixed regarding whether high volume users are more or less responsive to price changes 17 20 21 unsurprisingly estimates of demand responses to ibr price structures vary widely and are influenced by demographic group region and estimation methodology 10 20 22 in this paper we investigate household demand responses to a peculiar change in the pricing of water in the city of norman oklahoma as described in table 1 the regime change was complex changing block ranges block rate structure and adding a 4 per month fixed fee the three lowest block ranges were condensed to two blocks and the rate structure flipped from decreasing with consumption to increasing the highest two block ranges stayed the same and the rates for both blocks were increased with the highest block rate remaining greater than lower block group rates the result was a pure ibr structure examining this unique regime change allows us to make several contributions to the literature the pricing change was not driven by a short run drought situation but rather by population driven demand growth and resulting need to expand infrastructure notably utility rates must be approved by norman voters which results in less frequent and larger size rate changes compared with utilities that do not have this requirement accordingly in contrast to most studies which consider small incremental price increases we investigate a large price increase at all levels of consumption the median household experienced more than a 60 increase in its water bill at its pre change level of consumption in addition norman s new price regime remained in effect for almost a decade allowing us to estimate longer run demand responses compared with similar regime change studies kenney et al 23 consider multiple switches between a uniform volumetric rate and an ibr structure during a five year drought period in aurora colorado nieswiadomy and molina 24 investigate the four years after a switch from a decreasing block structure to a two block ibr structure in denton texas we add to the few papers which focus on price responses of low volume users as well as the growing literature investigating heterogeneous response to water pricing the price regime shock had different impacts on the pricing for low and high volume users the addition of a fixed fee coupled with a one cent reduction in the lowest block rate led to a tripling of the water bills for the lowest volume users few papers address impacts on lower volume users in an ibr setting likely because price increases are typically designed to be small at the low end of consumption range 1 1 kenney et al 23 investigates small price change impacts on low volume users instead the research tends to focus on conservation behavior of high volume users who are impacted by higher block rates across the distribution as well as the addition of blocks at the top end of the ibr structure 17 25 our data is ideal it includes monthly residential water consumption records from 2002 to 2010 house and lot details billing cycle dates and neighborhood location which allows us to create localized billing cycle rainfall measures rainfall is a key factor we extend nieswiadomy and molina 24 sync city wide rainfall measures to the billing cycle to account for temporal variation in rainfall our measure accounts for local spatial variation by using measures from the nearest of 39 sensors located throughout the city of norman to address the challenges created by the co determination of price and consumption under ibr structures we estimate separate demand equations for households grouped by consumption volume prior to the price regime change following kenney 23 and wichman 17 2 2 see soliman 18 for a review of approaches to address the co determination problem we extend these by grouping households according to the block group corresponding to their last gallon of consumption which respects the rate structure boundaries and the unique price shock for each group despite the considerable interest in estimating heterogeneous responses to water price changes under different rate structures there is no clear guidance on how to model price signals 17 26 30 in our baseline estimates we use a dummy variable to reflect the post regime change and then back out elasticity estimates based on actual price changes that occurred for the median user in each block group this approach recognizes that each group is impacted by a unique rate structure shock and that the lowest block rate fell by a negligible amount one cent per 1000 gallons we also investigate other specifications found in the literature an instrumental variable approach using lagged volumetric charges and a fuzzy regression discontinuity design approach as expected we find heterogeneous responses to price regime change across the consumption distribution all except the ultra low volume households reduced consumption in the post price change period and displayed inelastic price elasticity of demand over the intermediate and long run the middle group which had the most households and largest predicted price responses contributed the most to overall conservation our results suggest that ibr can be used to address revenue and conservation needs 2 background 2 1 ibr policy a large and growing literature addresses the challenges of assessing the impact of ibr structures on consumer water demand 10 18 20 22 ideally researchers want to observe water rate changes accounting for other factors driving water use particularly weather local water management conditions and customer characteristics income property features etc data limitations are a major issue 31 few papers have sufficient data to allow for straightforward analysis of responses to water rate changes holding other factors constant researchers commonly use panel data in conjunction with fixed effects for year month and or customer depending on data availability 17 18 23 context and empirical approaches vary considerably across studies making out of sample projections difficult local water supply and demand conditions impact pricing policies for example cities with ample supply have less need to implement conservation pricing strategies in contrast cities which face rising production costs are attracted to ibr structures because they charge higher rates to higher volume users clearly past aggregate consumption trends may drive price capacity expansion needs leading to water price increases 32 residential water users are likely to be influenced by the policy change drivers as well public discussions about water supply conditions and policy responses can influence residential water demand decisions although ibr structures are designed to encourage conservation it is not clear if customers fully comprehend complex pricing signals when faced with non linear and multiple price components strong and goemans 33 refer to ibr as a penalty structure where payment occurs after consumption has occurred notably they find that real time information leads to increased water consumption which conflicts with conservation goals ibr can lead to increased consumption if individuals maximize utility by consuming up to the block boundary individuals below a boundary before an ibr is implemented or changed may respond to the change by increasing consumption 19 33 recent quasi experimental research investigates four possible regime change policy scenarios implementation of a new ibr structure from an existing non ibr scheme 17 33 modification of an ibr structure by adding new top block rates 20 25 and temporary transitions to and from irb systems 23 and an increase in rates across an established ibr structure while holding block ranges constant 24 we investigate a complex transition to an ibr structure a new fixed fee was introduced block ranges were altered and the structure changed from an unusual decreasing then increasing structure to a strictly ibr structure 2 2 norman s water rate structure background located on the southern edge of the oklahoma city metropolitan area the city of norman has an estimated population of 96 000 people in 2000 the city experienced rapid population growth starting in 1980 increasing 18 from 1980 to 1990 and another 19 2 from 1990 to 2000 3 3 us census bureau county and city data book 2000 34 norman s main water sources lake thunderbird and ground water wells were insufficient to meet growing demand in 2000 the city completed a connection with oklahoma city s utility to provide water on an emergency basis 35 the need to expand water capacity was apparent norman water utility managers are constrained in their ability to adjust water rates due to the passing of a 1974 initiative petition requiring voters to approve utility rate increases 4 4 the initiative petition was a backlash to the mayor using increased rates to pay for increased policing layden 36 voting on utility rates is unique in oklahoma but not uncommon across the united states as a consequence of the election requirement norman s utility rate increases occur less frequently and are of larger magnitude compared with utilities that have the authority to incrementally increase rates as needed the focus of our analysis is the impact of the water rate changes implemented as of may 2006 in the city of norman the previous rates had been in place since 1999 the 1999 rates were meant to promote water conservation among high volume residential users and pay for needed water supply expansions 37 the structure implemented in 1999 structure was unusual it kept declining rates over the first three blocks and added two blocks with increasing rates at higher volumes of consumption 38 5 5 we know exact locations of sensors but only the census tract for water customers households are assigned the rainfall measure matching the sensor in the same census tract if it contains a sensor or the closest tract if not the block ranges and rates are shown in table 1 the lowest two blocks ultra low and low each had a range of only 1 000 gallons of consumption per month with volumetric rates of 2 01 and 1 73 per gallon respectively the middle block ranged from 2 000 to 15 000 gallons with a volumetric rate of only 1 14 per gallon the high block ranged from 15 000 to 20 000 gallons with a rate of 2 00 the ultra high block had a rate of 4 double that of the next highest block the higher rates for the first few thousand gallons might be viewed as an alternative to having a fixed fee because all users pay the higher costs on the first few thousand gallons consumed in a month according to a 2004 u s congressional report 39 29 of customers used over 15 000 gallons per month in 1998 but as of 2003 only 11 of the customers fell into this excessive use range apparently the financial incentive curbed consumption for high volume users changes in epa regulations regarding maximum levels of arsenic resulted in the loss of 13 wells in norman s system 40 the city sought and received voter approval for a significant rate payer increase to cover costs to replace these wells and to upgrade the system the shift to a pure ibr structure included adding a fixed fee and changing the block ranges table 1 shows block ranges and volumetric rates corresponding to the price regimes in place from 1999 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2015 fig 1 provides a graphical representation the size of the change in the volumetric prices in each block range varied the ultra low block rate was reduced by one cent per thousand gallons all the other block rates were increased as follows 0 27 between 1 000 and 2 000 gallons 0 86 between 2 000 and 5 000 gallons 0 96 between 5 000 and 15 000 gallons 0 75 between 15 000 and 20 000 gallons and 0 95 over 20 000 gallons table 2 shows the total and average charges associated with the price structure in place before and after the 2006 rate change the percentage changes in the top block rate and total charges are calculated using a midpoint calculation the block groups are based on the pre regime change rate structure as illustrated in fig 2 the total charges increased for all volumes of consumption the ultra low group experienced a near tripling of the water charge which increased from 2 01 to 6 00 4 fixed fee plus 2 volumetric charge for 1 000 gallons of consumption the total charge for low group more than doubled for 2 000 gallons of consumption the increase in the total charge for the middle group ranged from 61 to 68 the block rates and total charges for the high and ultra high groups increased by smaller percentages fig 3 shows the average charge per thousand gallons of consumption for the two fee structures it highlights the dramatic increase in the average water cost for the first few gallons of consumption after the price change the changes in the block widths as well as the non uniform increase in the block rates highlight the importance of controlling for pre change consumption and block range structure when estimating demand responses 3 empirical specification 3 1 data we estimate demand responses to the 2006 water price change using micro level panel data spanning 2002 to 2010 the focus is on residential water customers which includes about 85 of the water utility customers in norman the city of norman gis staff graciously merged water bill records with information from 2014 property tax records from the cleveland county assessor office to preserve privacy we use daily rainfall measures from national weather service nws records following nieswiadomy and molina 24 daily records are aggregated to correspond to days covered in the household s billing cycle month our measure goes beyond city wide estimates by matching each house to the closest of 39 nws sensors located throughout norman 6 6 we thank the anonymous reviewer for suggesting that we explore this approach this makes our rainfall measure a key demand driver more accurate with regard to temporal and spatial dimensions compared with typical studies customers are grouped based on their average monthly consumption from january to december of 2005 the year prior to the price regime change this approach is similar to kenney et al 23 and wichman 17 who group customers by quartiles and deciles respectively rather than assigning households into evenly distributed groups we group households according to the block structure in the pre change period as described in table 1 this offers the advantage of not only controlling for persistent pre change water demand behavior but also accounts for the unique structure change impacting each group summary statistics for each group are given in table 3 the middle group includes the median volume consumer and has the greatest number of households 19 996 not surprisingly the ultra low group has only 270 customers the low group high group and ultra high groups have 1 014 1 287 and 841 customers respectively looking across the block groups we see a link between consumption and factors related to income as anticipated higher volume users live in larger newer homes with more bathrooms larger pools and larger outdoor pervious surface areas on average lower volume users have smaller older houses with fewer bathrooms consistent with lower income households this suggests heterogeneity in water consumption preferences across groups it also highlights the importance of accounting for group size when predicting system wide conservation impacts 3 2 demand estimation an extensive literature addresses how to estimate demand when pricing is non linear olmstead 41 discusses reduced form versus structural modelling approaches under block rate structures following previous studies 8 29 32 42 we estimate a straightforward demand equation using a log linear approach 1 c itj α j β 1 regime c h a n g e t β 2 rainfal l it β 3 h o u s e i γ m o n t h t ε it where cit j is the natural log of water consumption for household i in month t for consumption group j by estimating demand for each group separately we can avoid the complications of the nonlinear price scheme regime change t is dummy variable which is set equal to one for all months after may 2006 when the new price scheme was in effect each group will experience a unique change in average and marginal price scheme after the change rainfall it is the sum of monthly rainfall recorded at the closest weather sensor these are calculated to correspond to the billing cycle month it is well known that rainfall is an important driver of water consumption particularly in summer months housei is a time constant fixed effect for household i alternatively we could include a vector of non varying household characteristics market value total area of the house lot area pool area number of bathrooms and year built for the year 2014 estimates with the detailed house variables are qualitatively similar these are not shown for brevity month t is a set of month dummy variables used to account for seasonal variation we focus on the months surrounding the price changes march september as these are the peak consumption months when conservation is most valuable εit are white standard errors homes with less than 100 gallons of charged consumption are eliminated to account for unoccupied homes and possible billing errors the sample is limited to homes built before 2006 the final sample includes 23 408 residential households 4 results 4 1 baseline estimates estimates corresponding to equation 1 are given in table 4 each column corresponds to the estimation of equation 1 for each block group heterogeneous responses to the price regime change are evident consistent with previous research all estimated coefficients on the regime change variable are significant at the 1 level except for the ultra low group the estimated regime change impacts were negative as expected with conservation pricing the estimated regime change impacts were similar in size for the upper three block groups ranging from 11 5 for the ultra high group to 13 for the middle group the low group has a much smaller estimated response in the post change period 4 6 taken at the group means for march september 2005 consumption the predicted reduction in monthly consumption is 73 gallons 929 gallons 2 134 gallons and 3 123 gallons for the low middle high and ultra high groups respectively for the ultra low volume group the estimated positive regime change coefficient is unexpected the estimated 11 6 change equates to 69 gallons a month based on average march september consumption in 2005 in the behavioral literature which investigates social messaging strategies boomerang effects are noted a boomerang effect occurs when low volume users increase their consumption after being made aware of their relatively low usage compared with their neighbors or other anchor group 43 in our scenario the election requirement provides a mechanism by which individuals are provided information attached to water bills and are primed to assess their own consumption through election brochures and community presentations an individual could learn if her usage is low relative to the average residential customer in the community potential psychological aspects could also be at play although these are relatively unexplored in the literature 44 the unexpected increase in water consumption could reflect a reaction to the addition of the fixed base fee leading customers want to get their money s worth by consuming more the water pricing structure seems to impact demand as reynaud et al 45 find the estimates of rainfall impacts are also notable estimated sensitivity to localized rainfall during the billing cycle increases across block groups for the ultra high group the estimated impact is a 0 8 reduction in monthly consumption for each additional centimeter of rainfall per billing cycle higher volume users are expected to be more sensitive to rainfall given that their use includes outdoor water the estimated impacts of rainfall are consistent with the literature and the predictions of water utility managers we investigate several alternative specifications to check the robustness of our baseline estimates 4 2 adding year fixed effects we extend the specification given in equation 1 by adding a set of year dummy variables to capture other contextual factors driving water demand which are not explicitly included in the model results are shown in table 5 the general pattern of heterogeneous responses across the groups remains the estimated regime change coefficients for the ultra low high and ultra high groups are amplified going from 11 6 to 28 6 12 4 to 15 and 11 5 to 20 3 for each group respectively in contrast the estimated regime change impact for the middle falls to 1 3 the estimated sign of the regime change impact for the low group switches from small negative 4 6 to non negligible positive value 11 5 this group is small there is some concern about adding year dummies as changes in attitudes and water policies are likely to be influenced by monthly weather patterns which are accounted for in the model recall our rainfall variable is fairly accurate and localized it is linked to both neighborhood and billing cycle 4 3 investigating alternate panel lengths we also investigate different panel lengths yoo et al 46 characterizes two year impacts as short run and an eight year time span as long run accordingly our baseline estimates can be viewed as intermediate or long run impacts see worthington hoffman 47 for a survey of short and long run elasticity estimates conventionally long run responses are expected to be greater than short run elasticities due to substitutability 46 48 table 6 shows estimates of the regime change coefficients corresponding to equation 1 using different panel lengths the first row repeats the baseline estimates for the 2002 to 2010 period shown in table 4 the second and third correspond to 2002 to 2009 and 2002 to 2008 periods respectively all of the estimated regime change coefficients retain the same signs and remain significant at the 1 level the coefficients on middle 10 3 and 8 4 high 8 and 5 8 ultra high groups 6 2 and 3 7 groups demonstrate similar trends and relative responses across groups the groups respond by conserving more over the longer period as expected over time high volume customers can adapt to higher prices by investing in sprinkler systems and other water saving devices 49 50 for the low group the shorter and longer run responses are nearly identical recall this group likely uses water primarily for indoor uses and is likely to spend a larger share of income on water costs the ultra low group displays larger positive responses in the longer run their water use is minimal with little room for reductions assuming they live in town during the summer months this result could reflect mean reversion if some of the households placed in this group were away in the pre regime change period 7 7 we do not present the ultra low specification results in table 7 because there is only a negligible change in the volumetric price for this group as expected we find that lag ave cvp was not significantly related to demand for the ultra low group it could also reflect learning and responding to the imposition of the fixed fee increasing consumption lowers the average price per unit consumed 4 4 specifications with price variables a common approach to estimating water demand uses the lagged value of average price or an instrumented value of the lagged average price to capture responses to price changes 23 29 30 we explore this approach but note its important limitations notably price variables are based on charged prices on water bills which reflect the price structure and consumption choice in our analysis changes in charged prices in the pre and post regime change periods reflect non price factors thus the estimated coefficients on the lag of the price variable reflect responses to past consumption choices rather than price changes in the pre period and reflect possible changes in responses to the price change in the post regime change period we present the results using instrumented values of the average charged volumetric price ave cvp expressed in log value given persistence of preferences for water usage and water use behavior we would expect specifications using the lag values and the instrumented lag values to yield similar results especially in specifications that account for weather during the billing cycle and month which is what we find our approach is similar to kenney et al 23 in the first stage ave cvp for a household is estimated as a function of all the block rates rainfall water meter route month year dummy variables and detailed housing features in 2014 including market value total area of the house pervious surface area pool area number of bathrooms and year built in the second stage monthly average consumption is estimated by adding the lagged value of predicted lag ave cvp and its interaction with the regime change variable to the right hand side of equation 1 this specification attempts to distinguish between the impact of the changes volumetric prices from the addition of the fixed fee and other non price aspects captured by the regime change variable notably households might have modified water demand behavior due to the increased awareness and education surrounding the water rate election further note that estimating consumption groups separately means that the estimated price variables represent impacts within those groups accounting for the factors which led to the group assignment in the first place finally the estimated coefficient for lag ave cvp represents an immediate response to last month s consumption which determines the average volumetric charge the results for each group which experienced block rate changes are shown in table 7 8 8 these results are not shown for brevity as expected the estimated regime change coefficients remain negative for the low middle high and ultra high groups 6 6 16 2 18 and 9 2 respectively the estimated lag ave cvp coefficients are close to zero and only the estimates for the middle group is statistically significant this is expected given that the middle group is large and includes a wide range of consumption compared to the other groups the estimated interaction coefficients lag ave cvp x regime change are positive and significant for the middle and high groups to understand the behavioral response in the post period we need to consider the combined effect of the three variables using the mean values of ave cvp for each group the estimated change in consumption based on results in table 7 versus the benchmark estimates in table 4 regime change were as follows 0 053 versus 0 046 for the low group 0 142 versus 0 130 for the middle group 0 159 versus 0 124 for the high group and 0 108 versus 0 115 for the ultra high group the results for the ultra high group while still suggesting conservation behavior in the post change period contrasts those of the lower volume users lag ave cvp represents certain consumption choices which are predicted with detailed characteristics in the post regime change period there was time to adjust usage to the increased demands we also note the importance of including an accurate localized rainfall measure in this specification estimations omitting rainfall led to greater predicted responsiveness to lagged price as well as to the regime change variables 9 this is expected given that rainfall is a key driver of variation in monthly water consumption this highlights the value of using refined localized rainfall measures in similar specifications 4 5 exploiting discontinuities a direct way to tease out differential responses by groups to rate changes exploits the price discontinuities at the block boundaries we estimated a fuzzy regression discontinuity design frdd type approach similar to wichman 17 and nataraj and hanemann 25 the forcing variable is average consumption in the year before the rate change 2005 the assignment is imprecise fuzzy because being below the cutoff in the previous year does not guarantee that a household is below the cutoff after the price change we look at two cutoffs 15 000 the boundary between the middle and high groups and 20 000 the boundary between the high and ultra high groups the cutoffs are the points where the marginal and average prices diverge under the old and new rate schedules we include households whose consumption falls within 1 000 gallons of the boundary in 2005 the year before the rate changes thus the estimates include households consuming between 14 000 and 16 000 gallons for middle high specification and between 19 000 and 21 000 gallons for the higher ultra high specification we do not run the frdd analysis for the low and ultra low boundaries because these groups have ranges of only 1 000 gallons each the specifications follow the typical modelling approach the regime change variable reflects the change in the fixed fee that both groups experience the above boundary variable is set to one if the household is above the boundary the estimated coefficient is expected to be positive indicating that these households are defined to have higher consumption the interaction between above boundary and regime change indicates the impact of the difference in the changes in the top block rate for each group in the estimation a positive estimated coefficient indicates that households consuming just above the border amount responded more to the marginal rate change compared with those just below the boundary the first set of columns in table 8 investigate the middle high discontinuity the estimated regime change coefficient 9 9 is similar to the baseline estimates in table 4 the estimated above boundary coefficient 2 2 is positive as expected given group assignment the estimated coefficient for the above boundary interaction with regime change is 2 2 intuitively the positive sign makes sense because the middle group s top rate increased by 0 96 per unit compared with 0 75 for the high group the second set of columns in table 8 investigate the high ultra high discontinuity again the estimated coefficient for the regime change variable 13 3 is negative and significant again the estimated above boundary coefficient 5 7 is positive as expected the estimated coefficient for the above boundary interaction with the regime change 4 is negative which corresponds to the larger change in the ultra high rate 0 95 versus the high rate 0 75 these refined estimates suggest that the ultra high group was successfully targeted for a larger conservation response also the middle group showed the biggest response to the price regime change which is as expected given that the change increased the block rate for the middle block range the most 5 discussion 5 1 elasticity estimates demand responses are commonly discussed in terms of price elasticity of demand different approaches have been used in the literature to estimate water demand elasticities 20 in our case estimating elasticity using just the change in the top block rate would be misleading given the addition of a fixed fee in 2006 further the rate changes for the top block of consumption do not reflect the rates for consumption at lower volumes of consumption we calculate demand elasticities using the average price and the marginal top block rate using baseline estimates from table 4 average price elasticities make sense if customers respond to average price when price schemes are complex as in ibr structures 15 17 elasticity estimates shown in table 9 are calculated at the march september 2005 average level of consumption for each block group the total charge and top marginal rates before and after the price regime change are calculated the percentage changes in prices are estimated using the midpoint formula and the estimated percentage changes in consumption are represented by the coefficient estimates for regime change given in table 4 for the ultra low group the estimated marginal price elasticity of demand makes no sense given that the price regime change reduced the volumetric rate for this group by one cent the estimated average price elasticity is 0 09 for the ultra low group the estimated marginal price elasticities range from 0 22 for the middle group to 0 54 for the highest group estimates of average price elasticities are shown in the last column of table 9 as expected these are smaller than the marginal price elasticity ranging from 0 06 for the low group to 0 30 for the ultra high group notably we find no evidence that conservation led to revenues loss e g a conservation conundrum 13 as all demand responses are in the inelastic range and the high volume users conserved but not enough to negatively impact utility revenues previous elasticity estimates vary considerably by context and empirical approach see asci et al 20 yoo et al 46 piper and davis 51 worthington and hoffman 47 espey and espey 52 and dalhuisen et al 53 for discussions of the ranges of elasticities found in the literature agthe and billings 49 for instance find that high income groups use more water and are less responsive to price changes than lower income users using survey data mansur and olmstead 50 find that rich households with big lots have lower demand elasticities in absolute value for outdoor uses compared with poor households and vice versa for indoor watering uses in contrast kenney et al 23 find that higher volume users are more responsive to price interventions with estimated average price elasticities of 0 34 0 57 and 0 75 for the low middle and high users respectively setting the ultra low group aside our results align with kenney s but our estimated elasticities are somewhat smaller in absolute size wichman 17 estimates average price elasticities from 0 43 to 1 14 across decile groups using triple difference models with an estimate of 0 31 in the tightest bandwidth of the frdd specifications consistent with previous literature we find systematic differences in demand elasticities across consumption groups a finding of relevance for water utility managers when designing water rate structures 5 2 implications for overall conservation the implication for system wide conservation depends on the size of each group as well as the estimated response to the price regime change table 10 provides a simple calculation of the predicted conservation based on the estimated change in demand using the baseline estimates shown in table 4 and the sample sizes for each group as shown in table 3 the average ultra low group household is predicted to increase consumption by 69 gallons per month yielding an estimated 18 729 increase for the group as a whole the average low group household is predicted to decrease consumption by about 73 gallons per month leading to an estimated decrease of 74 164 gallons for the group combined the average household in the middle group is predicted to reduce consumption by 929 gallons per month this group is large constituting about 85 of the households in our data leading to a combined estimate of 18 6 million fewer gallons per month in comparison the average customer in the high group is predicted to reduce consumption by 2 133 gallons per month for an overall predicted reduction of 2 7 million gallons per month the average ultra high group customer is predicted to reduce consumption by a large amount 3 133 gallons per month for a combined reduction of 2 6 million for the group combined the estimated reduction in residential water use is 24 million gallons per month for the march through september months or about 168 million gallons for the seven months combined the ultra high household had the greatest predicted per household conservation which suggests that the change in the ibr structure was effective at encouraging conservation from the luxury user sector of the market the greatest source of overall conservation however came from the middle group which includes the most users accordingly knowing behavior of this group is key for meeting total conservation needs 6 conclusion when pricing water managers seek to balance multiple objectives including cost recovery conservation and equity we investigate a peculiar regime change in which an unusual block structure with volumetric rates that were decreasing at low volumes and increasing at higher volumes was converted to a standard ibr structure the lowest volume users faced a large bill increase driven by the addition of the fixed fee higher volume groups experienced increases in block rates in addition to the new fixed fee the price increases were large consistent with a policy environment where rate changes are infrequent due to the requirement that voters must approve rate changes our baseline estimates reflect longer run responses consistent with previous literature we find substantial heterogeneity in responsiveness to rate changes across user groups and between shorter and longer run periods the ultra low volume group responds to the introduction of the fixed fee by increasing consumption the election process might have informed them of their low usage relative to others in the community or this group might have increased consumption to get their money s worth for the fixed fee the other four groups responded to the price regime change by decreasing consumption as anticipated we note that low volume households are likely to be poorer a potential equity concern arises if price changes push poor households to reduce water consumption below basic necessity levels 10 we see little evidence that this occurs given the small predicted reductions in water consumption for the low volume group and the increase for the ultra low group our results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications found in the literature including using lagged charged volumetric price variables and fuzzy regression discontinuity estimation we confirm earlier research where the majority of customers those in the middle of the consumption distribution faced the greatest increase in their top block rate and had relative larger responses to price increases it is important for water utility managers to anticipate muted responses to conservation prices for the ultra high volume customers especially if the goal is to target conservation by customers using water for luxury uses further if households have heterogeneous willingness to pay for water then as mansur and olmstead 50 argue a price based approach has a theoretical advantage over restrictive policies such as water rationing during droughts our results must be interpreted with care we focus on march through september which includes peak summer months lyman 54 suggests that price elasticity of demand is more than twice as high in peak summer periods than off peak periods in addition the city of norman is unique in requiring local elections leading to long periods between utility rate elections and large discrete changes in water prices compared with communities that can change water utility rates administratively further the situation we investigate was not typical of changes associated with initial implementation or adjustments to ibr structures echoing sebri 22 and lu et al 10

8667,the value and vulnerability of salt marshes has led to efforts to ensure their preservation including the preservation of marsh transgression zones uplands onto which marshes can migrate and restrictions on shoreline armoring coastal armoring involves the placement of hardened structures such as revetments and bulkheads along the shoreline these structures can prevent coastal marshes from migrating onto adjacent uplands as sea levels rise thereby causing marsh loss over time hence efficient targeting of efforts to ensure marsh sustainability requires an understanding of where and why coastal armoring is likely to occur this article develops a random utility model that characterizes residential landowners shoreline armoring decisions for beachfront and non beachfront residential property focusing on whether armoring is influenced by features related to marsh migration the model is illustrated using parcel level data from accomack county virginia with armoring observations on each parcel for two time periods 2002 and 2013 independent models for the two time periods suggest that landowners in the case study area do not tend to construct armoring in ways that impede marsh migration all else equal armoring is less likely to occur in areas suitable for marsh migration rather armoring appears to be motivated primarily by factors associated with shoreline erosion risk such as high wave energy keywords adaptation armoring coastal economics salt marsh sea level rise 1 introduction the value of salt marsh ecosystems is recognized as an important motivation for coastal adaptation to sea level rise 1 10 until recently salt marshes have been largely resilient to changes in sea level due to natural adjustments in elevation via vegetation growth and sediment accretion and by migrating landward as sea levels rise 11 12 however there is increasing concern about impending loss of salt marsh given accelerated sea level rise with regional and global analyses forecasting up to a 20 45 marsh loss by 2100 13 14 given limits in the extent to which salt marshes can build elevation naturally and hence keep up with sea level rise in a single location the natural migration of salt marsh onto neighboring uplands is necessary for marsh persistence in many areas particularly under rapid sea level rise this migration requires the presence of marsh transgression zones undeveloped and non armored uplands onto which marshes can migrate landward as sea levels rise 3 coastal armoring that prevents marsh migration e g riprap revetments bulkheads can create a coastal squeeze wherein marshes progressively drown as they are trapped between these hardened structures and rising waters leading to gradual reduction of marsh extent over time 15 17 potential barriers to marsh migration are significant especially in regions such as the us atlantic coast where over 40 of land within 1 m above tidal wetlands is developed this is expected to increase in the future 18 from a purely biophysical perspective shoreline armoring e g the placement of bulkheads or revetments parallel to the shoreline can exacerbate salt marsh losses over time yet despite the potential for detrimental impacts on marsh ecosystems shoreline armoring may be viewed as an optimal decision from the perspective of private landowners seeking to protect property from erosion flooding marsh migration or other hazards 19 because many of the goods and services provided by salt marshes are public or quasi public goods 3 armoring decisions of this type may be privately optimal even if they lead to a net loss of social welfare due to diminished ecosystem services 20 however recent calls for urgent attention and pre emptive planning to set aside key coastal areas for wetland migration 21 p 49 imply that ongoing development and armoring are occurring in ways that threaten marsh migration over time public and private agencies have responded to these potential threats to coastal marsh persistence in multiple ways many of which seek to prevent or attenuate the potential effects of development and armoring that occurs on privately owned land for example in our case study area of virginia considerable effort has been made by public and private institutions to preserve salt marshes recognizing the potential impact of private shoreline development and armoring decisions on existing marshes and future marsh migration 22 among public actions the virginia department of conservation and recreation has created several natural area preserves for marsh conservation additionally virginia state law requires permit authorization for any private shoreline development or armoring project that impacts wetlands 1 1 per subtitle iii of title 28 2 of the code of virginia permits must be obtained from the virginia marine resources commission vmrc for any shoreline project that would potentially impact subaqueous or bottomlands tidal wetlands and coastal primary sand dunes 49 however although it is the state s responsibility to protect and manage coastal lands through virginia s coastal zone management program 2 2 the program established in 1986 is a network of state and local agencies which administer the enforceable laws and regulations that protect coastal resources including wetlands and armoring is controlled through the permitting process armoring by private landowners has increased in recent years see the data section below for more detail potential shoreline armoring by landowners has direct implications for future marsh migration under sea level rise on the additionality of land preservation for future marsh migration and hence on public agency decision making for salt marsh preservation 3 12 23 3 3 although this paper studies armoring decisions by private landowners public agencies can also choose to construct shoreline armoring in ways that affect marshes for example to prevent beach erosion or flooding of coastal communities 4 however as most us coastal land is privately owned actions to sustain coastal marshes tend to focus on preventing development and armoring on private land cf 3 yet despite the potential for future armoring to impact marsh loss over time e g by preventing upland marsh migration it is unclear whether human decisions to armor the coastline are currently being made in a way that threatens remaining marshes not all shoreline armoring affects potential marsh migration for example armoring structures built in areas subject to high wave energy and erosion potential may have minimal impact on marsh migration potential because high energy coastal areas of this type are not conducive to marsh survival 24 25 in contrast other types of hardened structures for example constructed directly upland of existing marsh systems may serve as impediments to marsh migration thereby causing a loss of marsh extent over time 12 26 26 provide illustrative examples of cases worldwide in which marshes are and are not impeded from migration due to the type of coastal armoring present in different locations analyses such as these show that the potential impact of shoreline armoring on coastal marshes depends on when and where these structures are built both of which are determined by landowner behavior duran et al 3 demonstrate how landowners choices to armor or not different types of coastal land directly influence optimal decisions regarding marsh conservation 4 4 application of the model in duran et al 3 requires assumptions on the extent to which private landowners will choose to armor different types of coastal land they discuss this issue explicitly in section 4 5 portfolio optimization under additionality because duran et al 3 do not have estimates of armoring probability they evaluate the sensitivity of model results to alternative assumptions on the likelihood of parcel armoring results developed here could enable the optimization of duran et al 3 to proceed without the need for these assumptions or associated sensitivity analyses despite the importance of these issues for coastal marsh sustainability the literature perhaps surprisingly provides little systematic empirical insight into the factors influencing coastal armoring decisions by property owners over time and whether these factors encourage the construction of armoring in locations where it is likely to impede marsh migration 3 27 among the few studies to address armoring decisions in general are 19 23 and 20 however as discussed below these studies provide limited insight into relationships between armoring decisions and potential marsh impacts other studies develop conceptual or theoretical frameworks that can be used to characterize coastal decision making in general situations but do not provide empirical results e g ref 4 thus while coastal armoring is widely acknowledged as a potential threat to salt marsh migration past work provides limited empirical insight into coastal armoring decisions in general and no direct information on whether armoring is likely to be constructed in ways that threaten salt marsh persistence to address this gap in the literature the present article develops a theoretically grounded discrete choice random utility model to evaluate the extent to which the armoring of coastal property is motivated by factors related to marsh migration we focus on coastal structures such as riprap revetments and bulkheads that are built roughly parallel to the shoreline and can hence serve as direct impediments to marsh migration the model considers whether recent behavioral patterns suggest that armoring on residential parcels is being constructed in locations that are likely to impede marsh migration it is estimated using geospatial and housing data from a case study of accomack county on virginia s eastern shore and capitalizes on a dataset with observations on shoreline armoring for two time periods 2002 and 2013 independent models are specified for each time period to determine the factors that motivated armoring in each period these outcomes are modeled as a function of independent variables that quantify each parcel s exposure to erosion flooding and marsh migration among other potential determinants of shoreline armoring the main model evaluates determinants of armoring observed on parcels as of 2013 the most recent date for which comprehensive armoring observations are available we then test robustness with an additional parallel model using armoring observations made roughly a decade prior in 2002 results provide robust evidence that armoring is less likely to occur in areas suitable for marsh migration the construction of armoring on or near a parcel is positively related to greater distances from salt marsh smaller proportions of nearby salt marsh in the surrounding landscape and areas that are poorly suited for salt marsh survival from an ecological perspective these results are robust to alternative model specifications and time periods results further suggest that the primary motivation for armoring in the case study area is protection against erosion and high wave energy factors negatively correlated with the presence of salt marsh these combined results suggest that while shoreline armoring can unquestionably prevent marsh migration from a biophysical perspective landowner behavior in the case study area shows that recent armoring has not been constructed primarily as a response to this migration 1 1 understanding drivers of shoreline armoring coastal armoring is widespread in the us occupying 12 to 30 of the total shorelines of individual states and reaching proportions of 50 70 or more along urban coasts 27 conceptually economists assume that armoring decisions by private landowners are motivated by anticipated benefits and costs as a function of the potential losses anticipated on unarmored parcels and the costs of building and maintaining armoring structures cf 28 29 for example there is evidence that houses near a rapidly eroding shore decline in value by 10 20 when compared to similar houses near stable shorelines 30 31 providing an economic incentive for shoreline protection 5 5 there is also evidence that homeowners with properties vulnerable to coastal risks i e low elevation and an eroding shoreline hold price premiums for the option to armor premiums of up to 22 were found for oregon coastal homeowners where state law prohibited armoring for properties developed after 1977 32 beyond general expectations such as these however there is limited research that seeks to understand the systematic behavioral drivers of this activity and whether these drivers tend to encourage armoring in locations that threaten particular types of coastal systems and services some of the major reported drivers of armoring include erosion storm surge and flooding 23 27 33 34 along with the structure s cost effectiveness and durability 20 although many of these arguments are not grounded in formal behavioral models of armoring decisions by landowners among the few articles to develop a formal behavioral model of shoreline armoring decisions grounded in economic theory is 19 who study the installation of beachfront protective structures on the oregon coast this prior work focuses on the potential for spatial spillovers in beachfront armoring decisions relying on a panel dataset of annual parcel data from 1990 to 2015 they find that the installation of beachfront armoring is influenced by a variety of factors related to geomorphology and erosion rates among other factors they also find neighboring parcel effects or spillovers to have an important influence 6 6 for example an unarmored landowner can be influenced by the perceived success or failure of his neighbor s armoring choice there is also the possibility of spillovers caused by the tendency of bulkheads and seawalls to deflect and transfer wave energy onto unarmored neighboring properties 19 35 perhaps the most closely related work to the present study is 23 who examine the determinants of armoring at the individual landowner level in an area where salt marsh is prevalent along the georgia estuarine coastline among the motivations for this prior study is to evaluate the drivers of armoring in a marsh dominated landscape motivated by potential impacts on marsh persistence this study combines data on coastal land parcels from 2016 and bulkhead and revetment armored structures from 2006 to 2013 identified through aerial imagery and on the ground field inspections using logistic regression similar to that presented here the study finds that shoreline slope elevation divided by the parcel s distance from the shoreline high energy shoreline environments and the presence of armored neighbors increase the likelihood of armoring although the study provides insight into factors relevant to both armoring and marsh migration potential such as wave energy the influence of salt marsh or variables directly related to marsh ecosystems on armoring is not directly examined earlier work by scyphers et al 2015 p 42 uses data from a survey of coastal homeowners in alabama to evaluate the most influential criteria for their decisions to maintain or modify their shoreline cost effectiveness durability aesthetics maintenance environmental impact water access permitting using tree based empirical classification models they argue that a neighbor s shoreline condition was the most powerful explanatory variable in predicting a homeowner s current shoreline condition a few other studies analyze large scale nationwide armoring patterns to explain drivers of habitat loss e g percentage of armored shoreline measured over the entire us coastline at the kilometer scale 27 however these studies are based solely on large scale correlations and are not intended to characterize individual e g property owner decision making although past work of this type provides evidence regarding the factors influencing private landowners armoring decisions none of these prior studies provide insight into behavioral drivers of shoreline armoring directly related to marsh migration potential in a mixed coastal landscape for example both 19 20 focus on the armoring of beachfront property which provides no direct insight into the behavior of landowners with property frontage on coastal marshes rather than beaches conversely peterson et al 23 focus on the armoring of estuarine coastal property where over 92 is dominantly fronted by salt marsh providing little variation in the armoring of parcels with and without salt marsh frontage hence the study does not consider whether or how the presence of salt marshes or the suitability of land for marsh migration influenced armoring behavior building on this prior work this article presents an empirical model of armoring decisions in a heterogeneous coastal landscape where coastal marsh migration is common and in which armoring could at least in principle be constructed in ways to prevent this migration among our primary research questions is whether armoring is constructed in locations that tend to affect marshes or potential marsh migration or in other types of locations where marshes are unlikely to exist now or in the future we also consider potential drivers related to marsh migration potential together with those related to erosion and storm surge flood risk the goal is to evaluate whether the primary motivator of armoring stems from preventing erosion flooding or marsh migration as indicated by factors relevant to each the analysis is grounded in a theoretical model of landowners shoreline armoring decisions with general parallels to prior work however there are important distinctions between the presented model and those found in prior work reflecting differences in objectives decision contexts and data for example 23 do not present a formal theoretical model to underpin their empirical analysis however their choice of variables has conceptual grounding in microeconomic theory with armoring installation specified as a function of variables associated with perceived risks and benefits cost and demographic social factors despite these general similarities to the empirical specification presented here the empirical model of 23 omits variables directly related to the current and potential future presence of marshes which are primary focus of the present study as a second example 19 emphasize the role of spatial spillovers in landowners armoring decisions over time using a long term panel of annual observations on beachfront parcels in oregon 7 7 corresponding to this data structure they develop a real options framework of armoring decisions over time this framework informs a reduced form panel data regression model designed to address concerns such as the potential endogeneity of peer group formation over time simultaneity of landowner decision making and the specification of peer effects 19 in contrast our focus is on the effect of largely time invariant dimensions of coastal geomorphology related to marsh presence and migration potential on the observed armoring of parcels as of 2002 and 2013 we hence orient the theoretical framework around a random utility model of the armoring decision during each period focusing primarily on the latter period unlike 19 we do not emphasize potential neighboring spillovers due to the armoring of nearby parcels although a model of this type is illustrated in an appendix as a robustness check 1 2 a model of landowner armoring decisions we begin by outlining the theoretical framework that underlies empirical estimation the empirical characterization of landowners armoring choices is grounded in a simple random utility model of armoring decisions that emphasizes characteristics of the property relevant to marsh migration among other potentially relevant factors we assume that each landowner makes decisions for a single parcel and focus on decisions made at any given time t within the context of this decision the landowner s utility is specified u r a z n m c and is assumed to be a function of the net present value of anticipated future property losses on the parcel due to coastal hazards such as flooding erosion and marsh incursion r the capitalized total cost of armoring 8 8 we assume that armoring costs include the present value of all construction and maintenance costs c and income m the variable r in utility can be thought of as the capitalized value of the future flow of all anticipated losses on the parcel as a function of armoring on the parcel a armoring on neighboring properties n and a vector of environmental topographical hydrodynamic and other biophysical factors that influence these anticipated losses z here a 1 denotes an armored parcel and a 0 denotes an unarmored parcel 9 9 we treat armoring as a binary outcome and abstract from issues related to the proportion of the parcel that might be armored in general we anticipate that r a 0 r n 0 with the latter expectation motivated by the tendency of armoring on parcels to deflect wave energy and increase erosion on neighboring land ceteris paribus 19 the expected effect of elements of z on r varies depending on the variable in question we further assume that u r 0 and u c 0 so that utility declines with anticipated damage to the parcel and with expenditures on armoring the marginal utility of income is assumed to be positive given this model we assume the landowner will armor the parcel if 1 u r a 1 z n m c u r a 0 z n m where the absence of armoring implies no armoring cost c 0 that is the landowner chooses to install armor if the anticipated utility derived with armoring is greater than utility anticipated with an unarmored parcel considering both the present value of anticipated property loss and armoring cost implicit in 1 is an understanding that this decision is made at a given time period t and that the decision is irreversible in the relevant planning horizon that is once a parcel is armored we assume that it is prohibitively expensive to remove the armoring structure 1 2 1 modelling the armoring decision making process grounded in this random utility framework we present a model in which all parcels are observed at a single time period t at which point they are either observed to be armored or unarmored to enable econometric analysis for this case we rely on the standard assumption that utility is composed of a deterministic component v and a stochastic component ε equation 1 thus becomes 2 v r a 1 z n m c ε a 1 v r a 0 z n m ε a 0 grounded in 2 one can specify the probability that armoring will be installed as of t 1 and hence observed p a 1 as 3 p a 1 p ε a 0 ε a 1 v r a 1 z n m c v r a 0 z n m if one assumes that stochastic utility components follow a type 1 extreme value distribution this probability may be modeled empirically using a conditional logit model with two choice alternatives 36 where p is specified as a logistic function of the observable utility difference for each landowner i given by 4 δ v v r a i 1 z i n i m i c i v r a i 0 z i n i m i we make the simplifying assumptions that utility and hence the utility difference is linear in the parameters and further that the damage function r may be specified in simple linear form as r a i z i μ 0 ai n i μ 1 a i for a i 0 1 where μ 0 ai and μ 1 a i are parameters conforming vectors or scalars 10 10 hence the anticipated reduction in the net present value of loss r when the parcel becomes armored may be specified as r a i 1 r a i 0 z i μ 0 ai 1 n i μ 1 a i 1 z i μ 0 ai 0 n i μ 1 a i 0 z i μ 0 ai 1 μ 0 ai 0 n i μ 1 a i 1 μ 1 a i 0 because we are considering a relatively homogeneous set of armoring structures bulkheads and revetments on one case study area we make an additional simplifying assumption that per unit e g per linear meter armoring costs do not vary across parcels 11 11 cost information is unavailable for these structures and hence this assumption cannot be validated in the present study however prior work supports assumptions of this type at least in general for example 19 find no significant parcel level variation in the cost of armoring installation when examining 2136 beachfront properties in tillamook and lincoln oregon given these assumptions the cost of shoreline armoring may be specified as a linear function of parcel shoreline frontage or alternatively size f i where f i is the relevant measure of parcel frontage or size that determines total armoring cost finally we assume that vector z i biophysical factors that influence anticipated losses is composed of a set of sub vectors e i s i m i x i and f i here e i is a vector of variables affecting anticipated erosion risk s i is a vector of variables affecting anticipated flood risk m i is a vector of variables affecting the anticipated risk of marsh migration on the property and x i is a vector of additional conditions that influence the perceived benefits of armoring note that because parcel frontage f i influences both the benefits and costs of armoring the net effect of this variable on utility and hence armoring probability is ambiguous grounded in this model straightforward manipulations yield the empirical reduced form utility difference equation to be estimated 5 δ v β 0 β 1 e i β 2 s i β 3 m i β 4 x i β 5 n i β 6 f i ε i where the betas represent reduced form parameter vectors and scalars to be estimated 12 12 theoretically each of these reduced form parameters to be estimated is defined as a function of underlying structural parameters for example based on the above specification and assumptions the reduced form parameter β 5 on n i may be defined as a theoretical function of underlying structural parameters θ μ 1 a 1 i μ 1 a 0 i where θ is the marginal utility of reductions in anticipated damage r available data do not allow the underlying structural parameters to be identified without additional maintained assumptions so estimation focuses on the reduced form of the behavioral equation 13 13 landowner income m i does not depend on armoring status and hence drops out of the linear utility difference equation δ v as noted above the model is estimated as a two alternative binary conditional logit model with huber white robust standard errors the dependent variable for estimation a i is set equal to one if a riprap or bulkhead armored structure is installed on parcel i by a specified date and zero otherwise 1 3 the data the models are estimated using data from a case study in accomack county the county is part of a narrow peninsula between the atlantic ocean and the chesapeake bay on the eastern shore of virginia usa this case study area was chosen due to its large areas of coastal marsh that are potentially vulnerable to a combination of sea level rise and local decisions to armor the shoreline coastal wetlands including salt marsh habitats in this region are threatened by sea level rise and increasing rates of shoreline hardening 3 and are among the primary targets for local conservation 22 average annual sea level rise in the eastern shore is estimated to be over twice the global average leading to additional concerns over the sustainability of marsh ecosystems 37 38 14 14 average sea level rise in the eastern shore is approximately 4 0 mm per year compared to a global average of 1 7 mm per year modeling in duran vinent et al 3 suggests that the extent of armoring on land suitable for marsh migration will be a critical determinant of future marsh extent in the area a substantial portion of the virginia shoreline is already armored or developed 15 15 as of 2009 approximately 793 km or 11 of virginia tidal waters had been hardened or armored with 29 km of shoreline hardened each year if current shoreline hardening trends continue 9 to 18 of additional shoreline is predicted to be hardened 50 100 years into the future 39 and accomack county has experienced a general upward trend in the number of permits issued to individuals for the construction of riprap and bulkhead armored structures fig 1 16 16 our current data do not allow issued permits to be linked to specific observed armoring structures hence we cannot determine the relationship between issued permits and observed armoring however there are multiple reasons why there is not a one to one relationship between issued permits and observed armoring in each year for example some permits allow multiple armoring structures to be built in other cases permits can be issued to restore or refurbish existing armoring structures rather than build new ones for reasons such as these determining relationships between observed armoring and issued permits would require historical analysis beyond the scope of the current data 17 17 although recent years 2019 2020 have shown a decrease in the number of issued permits relative to some prior years this may be part of the year to year fluctuations that have been occurring since the early 1990 s representing natural variation rather than a structural break in the long term upward trend however it might also suggest changing trends on permit requests while data suggest that shoreline armoring is ongoing however it is unclear whether these structures are being constructed in ways that potentially impact coastal marshes as noted above we restrict the analysis to parcels classified as single family residential to ensure homogeneity the data were further screened to include only parcels with a size of 20 acres or smaller with homes built prior to 2013 since the outcome of interest relies on changes in armoring status prior to that time parcels without coastal exposure were excluded where exposure was defined to include all parcels within a 20 m distance of the coast we allow for non zero distances 20 m to accommodate the fact that the risk of future erosion storm surge flooding and marsh migration is not limited to parcels with current coastal frontage 0 m distance preliminary models were estimated with different cutoffs for coastal exposure and frontage showing largely robust results for different distances between 0 and 20 m after screening the final sample includes 1665 coastal single family parcels the size and location of the parcels armored structures and current salt marsh habitats are illustrated in fig 2 to evaluate the determinants of shoreline armoring for these parcels an original dataset was developed combining information on single family residential parcels land cover and shoreline structures data on single family residential parcels was taken from the accomack county office of the assessor using virginia s gis clearinghouse hosted by the virginia geographic information network 18 18 http data virginia gov datasets 8e222d4ffbea4f8ba552a089866ec11f these data included tax parcel data and land ownership polygons with information such as the parcel location dwelling value land value land use property owner acreage improvements and structural housing characteristics land cover information was obtained from sources including the national wetlands inventory and the virginia department of conservation and recreation flood zone information was taken from the federal emergency management agency 19 19 fema sfha special flood hazard area flood zone designations are commonly used to define variables for economic valuation and other types of modeling as done here however realized flood risks and economic effects e g on housing values for individual parcels can vary even within areas with the same or similar sfha designations 40 41 because the present data do not allow micro scale quantification of flood risk beyond current sfha designations we proceed with analysis based on these designations we acknowledge that improved measures of flood risk for each parcel could potentially support more refined estimates of flood risk effects on armoring but leave such analysis for future work information on shoreline structures was obtained from the virginia institute of marine science s vims shoreline inventory reports sir from 2002 to 2016 and accomack county shoreline management model smm from 2016 42 43 20 20 the vims sir 2016 data was published in 2016 and includes shoreline structure information from the spring of 2013 using aerial satellite imagery 42 43 the vims sir 2002 data was recorded through observations in the field taken by boat along the shoreline using a gps tracker this is based on correspondence with gis programmer analyst tamia rudnicky a member of the team that compiled the shoreline data at the vims the sirs contained information on land use and shoreline conditions the presence of beaches and shoreline structures these included bulkheads riprap wharfs groins jetties and unconventional protection structures the smm contained data on the presence or absence of tidal marsh forested riparian buffers bank vegetation cover wave exposure fetch and nearshore water depth bathymetric data unlike the sir data which included shoreline structure information at two points in time 2002 and 2013 the smm data only included shoreline conditions at one point in time 2013 due to this data limitation we require the assumption that shoreline conditions remain effectively constant over the period covered by the analysis i e parcels armored by 2002 and parcels armored by 2013 are influenced by similar shoreline conditions for this reason we also consider the 2013 model to be more reliable and hence the primary model for deriving our results and conclusions as described above the outcome of interest is whether a parcel is observed to have revetments e g riprap or bulkheads within 20 m of the parcel edge defined as an armored parcel this allows for the possibility that relevant armoring structures may be observed in areas that are between a parcel and the water but that are nonetheless outside of the legally recognized parcel boundary 21 21 this also enables the data to capture the presence of armoring structures for which minor variations in geocoding or parcel boundaries within gis data layers cause the structure to mistakenly appear as outside the parcel boundary when in fact it is located on the parcel alternative preliminary models were also estimated where a zero distance threshold was used to identify armored parcels armoring is observed within the legal parcel boundary these models have poorer statistical fit than those with a 20 m threshold although results regarding salt marsh see below are largely robust 22 22 the only exception regards proportions of salt marsh near the parcel although proportions of salt marsh within 100 or 200 m of a parcel was found to influence armoring decisions in all of the 20 m threshold models this was never the case in the 0 m threshold logit models all other key results are robust and the primary conclusions of the analysis do not change due to the improved empirical performance we proceed with models that use a 20 m threshold to assign armored status for purposes of defining the dependent variable s models which use the alternative 0 m threshold to assign armored status can be found in the appendix dependent variables are defined using these underlying armoring measures arm13 is assigned a value of 1 if the parcel was observed to be armored by 2013 and a 0 otherwise and arm02 is defined similarly for parcels armored by 2002 23 23 note that these dependent variables are defined based on physically observable armoring on the parcel this eliminates the possibility of recall or other biases associated with the potential use of survey responses or other indirect approaches to identify armored parcels in doing so it is assumed that the owners of each parcel make decisions on whether to armor that parcel independent variables hypothesized to have potential influence on armoring decisions include environmental factors that increase the risk of property loss from erosion wavenrgy low storm surge flood fld and marsh migration marshplant smdist sm100 m sm200 m and factors that potentially mitigate these risks elev forestshore smdist sm100 m sm200 m and beachdist also included are non environmental factors related to the parcel that influence these risks such as its assessed dwelling value dwlgvall 24 24 this is defined as the assessed value of the dwelling itself the structure based on features such as the house size and quality of the building materials we use dwelling value rather than property value in the model to allay endogeneity concerns related to potential two way causal relationships between property values and the presence of armoring see discussion in ref 19 and exposure to the coast coast frnt lastly parcel armoring might be affected by whether its neighbors parcels are armored and this is examined in neighb500 m and neighb1km allowing for the possibility of spillover effects 19 neighb500 m and neighb1km are defined as proportions 25 25 unlike counts of armored neighbors proportions are not confounded by the density of a neighborhood of neighbors armored within 500 and 1000 m of a parcel since the definition of armored changes between models these spillover variables are altered accordingly i e proportions of neighbors armored by 2013 and 2002 using either 20 or 0 m distance thresholds between the parcel and the structure these neighboring spillover variables are not included in the primary models in the main text but are included as a robustness check in the appendix table 1 provides a list of variables used and their descriptions descriptive statistics shown in table 2 highlight the differences between coastal single family homes that were arm13 1 and were not arm13 0 armored by 2013 the full sample includes both groups for the full sample the average parcel had a dwelling value dwlgval1 of 159 739 in 2018 usd and was on average 1 744 acres acreage in size on average 23 1 of land within 200 m of parcels was salt marsh sm200 m most parcels were in flood zones fld and in areas with low wave energy wavenrgy low at 84 0 and 59 6 respectively lastly parcels had on average 20 2 of their neighbors within 500 m armored by 2013 approximately 50 of parcels were armored by 2013 showing considerable variation in this variable as anticipated an initial evaluation of variable means suggests systematic univariate differences between parcels that were armored or not for example the mean elevation elev of parcels that become armored is lower at 1 019 m compared to 1 390 m for parcels that were never armored parcels that become armored also seem to be at higher risk of erosion relative to those that never have armor since only 47 5 are in a shoreline with low wave energy wavenrgy low compared to 71 7 for parcels that were not armored in another example 59 2 of parcels that become armored are in areas suitable for planting salt marsh marshplant compared to 98 0 for parcels that were not armored wilcoxon rank sum tests are used to determine whether the environmental and parcel characteristics in the samples of armored and unarmored parcels are likely to derive from the same population results from these tests reject the null hypotheses p 0 01 and indicate statistically significant differences in the observed characteristics 1 3 1 robustness and endogeneity as discussed by prior works such as 19 44 analyses of spatial decisions such as these are complex and it is important to verify the robustness of results to various types of statistical concerns recognizing this complexity the presented models were developed after the estimation of multiple alternative exploratory models to evaluate the robustness of our conclusions regarding the influence of coastal geomorphology on armoring focusing on landscape attributes relevant to salt marsh migration as noted above we also present parallel models for our two time periods primary robustness checks and results are presented below and in the appendix for example key model results and conclusions are unchanged regardless of the inclusion or exclusion of variables on the armoring of neighboring parcels neighb500 m and neighb1km since these variables pose additional endogeneity concerns see the appendix for a detailed discussion and do not influence our hypothesis tests on the effect of conditions related to marsh migration our primary logit model results omit these variables in general all exploratory models and those used for robustness testing verify the key conclusions presented below 2 results table 3 presents conditional logit model results with the dependent variables arm13 and arm02 given that the latter model entails an additional caveat regarding the accuracy of its results 26 26 since data on shoreline characteristics were only available for 2013 this model requires the assumption that similar conditions held for armoring that took place by 2002 we focus the primary discussion on arm13 the second column and use arm02 the first column as a robustness check a wald chi square test indicates that the overall model is significant χ 2 449 94 p 0 01 results for statistically significant variables comport with prior expectations derived from theory and intuition for example higher dwelling values and greater coastal exposure raise the probability of a riprap or bulkhead revetment being observed on or near the parcel as of 2013 as both conditions increase anticipated losses on unarmored parcels due to coastal hazards parameter estimates from the 2013 model suggest that many parcel features related to erosion storm surge flood and marsh migration risk have statistically significant influences on armoring probability for example parcels located in areas with low wave energy wavenrgy low and hence low erosion risk are less likely to be armored similar results are found for parcels protected from erosion by a forested shoreline forestshore parcels with a higher elevation elev are also less likely to be armored this is intuitive because higher elevation parcels are less vulnerable to many types of coastal hazards lastly parcels further from beaches beachdist are more likely to be armored which may be due to erosion protection in the case of wide beaches and or a desire to maintain the aesthetics of parcels closer to beaches which may be devalued with armoring 27 27 proportions of beach within 100 and 200 m of parcels were included in preliminary models but were either not statistically significant or dropped due to a lack of nonzero observations the average home was over 9 km from the nearest beach 28 28 results for 2002 also suggest that larger parcels were less likely to be armored as of that year acreage this effect however becomes insignificant as of 2013 it is possible that small parcels were more likely to be armored by 2002 because the structure home in smaller parcels is more likely to be close to the shoreline and hence more directly threatened by coastal flooding or erosion ceteris paribus however as we do not have data on the specific location of housing structures within each parcel as of 2002 we do not have a means to test this assertion directly the key hypotheses of interest however relate to whether armoring decisions are being made in systematic ways that threaten salt marshes for example that would prevent marshes from migrating onto suitable upland areas theory alone provides no clear expectation on the direction or magnitude of these effects on the one hand variables positively related to salt marsh migration could increase armoring likelihood if landowners perceive future marsh migration is a risk to structures or property value on the other hand marsh presence can provide natural protection from storm surge and flooding thereby reducing the need for armoring structures 2 the net effect of marsh related variables on parcel armoring depends on how landowners perceive and balance offsetting effects such as these this model draws insights on this question based on whether parcels were armored or not as of 2013 results provide evidence that armoring is being constructed in systematic ways that tend not to threaten salt marshes for example the positive and statistically significant parameter p 0 01 on smdist suggest that parcels are more likely to have armored structures placed near them when located further away from salt marshes the negative and significant p 0 01 parameter estimate on sm100 m suggests that larger proportions of marsh land cover within 100 m are associated with a reduced probability of armoring similarly the negative and significant parameter p 0 01 on marshplant indicates that armoring is more likely in areas that are not ecologically suitable for the survival of salt marsh we also find evidence that armoring tends to be constructed in areas with moderate or high wave energy wavenrgy low 0 areas that tend to be poorly suited to marsh sustainability nearly all marsh related results are robust when compared to those from a similar logit model predicting armoring by 2002 shown in the first column of table 3 we find consistent results for smdist marshplant wavenrgy low forestshore and coast frnt however there are some differences in other results suggesting that some types of armoring patterns may have changed over time for example the negative and significant p 0 01 parameter estimate on sm200 m in the 2002 model suggests that larger proportions of marsh land cover within 200 m were associated with a reduced probability of armoring in 2002 furthermore elev and dwlgval1 were not significant determinants of armoring during the earlier period these results suggest that armoring in the studied area tends not to be constructed in areas suitable for marsh migration they do not imply that armoring never influences marshes in the case study area or that marsh preservation is not a relevant concern only that the systematic component of armoring decisions observed in 2002 and 2013 led to the placement of armoring in locations that were less suitable for marsh migration in general 3 conclusion although the empirical results presented above apply to the studied area on the us east coast the methods developed here can be potentially applied to any coastal location for which suitable observations on parcel armoring are available moreover unlike methods such as those in ref 19 that require annual observations on parcel armoring for an extended period data unavailable for most coastal locations the presented approach only requires a single observation per parcel at one time period hence while we cannot provide the type of temporal insight possible with annual parcel armoring data over extended periods the illustrated method is more broadly applicable although the present study focuses on marsh migration this method could be adapted to study multiple topics of interest related to armoring decisions focusing on our primary hypotheses of interest results in the present case provide robust evidence that armoring in the studied area is motivated primarily by biophysical factors that influence hazard exposure such as exposure to parcel erosion due to high wave energy results do not suggest that armoring is being constructed to reduce the risk of marsh migration onto a property in fact the opposite seems to be happening coastal properties are more likely to have riprap revetments or bulkheads or be near these structures when they are located further away from salt marsh around smaller proportions of salt marsh and in areas less suited for planting salt marsh areas less likely to have marsh migration as shown in the appendix these results are robust to the inclusion of variables designed to capture neighboring spillover effects this finding does not imply that shoreline armoring is unimportant to future marsh migration or that actions should not be taken to preserve marsh transgression zones for example other types of human actions can negatively influence the potential upland migration of marshes and some types of armoring in the case study area do affect marshes however results do imply the importance of understanding how and why landowners choose to armor their parcels when designing policies and programs to sustain coastal marshes for example duran vinent et al 3 show that findings of this type affect the additionality of actions taken to ensure future marsh persistence there are multiple possible explanations for these observed patterns first as noted above salt marsh is known to provide natural protection from coastal hazards such as flooding and erosion 1 2 these ecosystem services may reduce the perceived need to armor a parcel against these other threats like 19 23 we find evidence that erosion is a primary concern when choosing whether to armor parcels the same patterns may lead to tendencies not to armor near marshes second as in many states virginia imposes monetary penalties and or requires mitigation for shoreline armoring with negative marsh impacts wetlands mitigation compensation policy and supplemental guidelines 2005 29 29 see https www vims edu ccrm wetlands mgmt docs permit fees2020 pdf these penalties provide a negative incentive for armoring in the vicinity of marshes finally unlike erosion that can occur quickly e g due to coastal storm events marsh migration is a slow process that may be viewed as less of a risk to property value and structures hence given the other factors discussed above landowners may perceive less of an urgent need to armor against marsh migration compared to other hazards although these results provide useful and previously unavailable insight regarding the influence of marsh migration and other determinants of armoring in general several caveats should be considered when interpreting model results first data collection methods used to identify armoring differed somewhat between the 2002 and 2013 data collection efforts each with their own advantages and disadvantages 30 30 the 2002 shoreline information was collected using direct visual inspection of structures the 2013 shoreline information was collected via high resolution remote sensing these differences could be a potential source of unanticipated variation in the dependent variables second results using the model of armoring by 2002 are only valid under the assumption that biophysical shoreline conditions in 2002 were similar to conditions in 2013 major differences in shoreline conditions could lead to measurement error in some regressors third although this research sheds light on whether armoring is taking place in locations that could potentially affect marsh migration it says nothing about whether those revetment or bulkhead structures actually prevent marsh migration there are many factors that make these structures more or less effective in this regard such as its relative height when compared to the tidal range 31 31 tidal wetlands only grow up to 1 5 times the tidal range in all of virginia with few exceptions in the chincoteague bay area of accomack county where the tidal range is under 1 foot this is based on the expert opinion of hank badger of the vmrc and its placement on the landward marsh edge 45 it is also important to recognize that these models are defined based on armoring observed on the ground not on reports of armoring by individual landowners we do not have direct information on who made decisions to construct each armoring structure only the parcels that are on or proximate to those structures the model assumes implicitly that the owners of parcels made armoring decisions based on the characteristics of each parcel finally the model does not include factors that may influence variations in the cost of armoring across parcels including for example the contractor used its size and materials data on any potential variations in cost is unavailable and hence could not be included in the model we leave extensions to address these and other potential limitations for future research despite these caveats the presented results have potentially important implications for policies designed to limit armoring with a goal of reducing impacts to salt marshes the finding that armoring is less likely to occur near salt marsh may indicate the success of current policy restrictions such as through permit authorization that provide incentives to minimize marsh impacts or may reflect the natural protections offered by salt marshes regardless of the explanation findings presented here highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics between armoring and marsh migration for conservation agencies and policymakers looking to preserve salt marshes if coastal parcels remain unarmored and undeveloped into the future land preservation may not be required to enable salt marsh migration under sea level rise to provide further guidance on where preservation may be needed a dynamic model of armoring decision making that can be tailored to future sea level rise and land use scenarios is required improved understanding of the forces that motivate parcel armoring decisions can help policies target actions that are likely to have the greatest net benefit in terms of protecting these valued systems credit authorship contribution

changes neighboring spillovers and a revised distance threshold to define armoring all models demonstrate the robustness of the general conclusions reported in the main text when considering neighboring spillover effects tables a1 and a 3 it is important to recognize that regressors of this type can be endogenous for example if an unobserved characteristic simultaneously influences armoring decisions on neighboring parcels 19 44 we also lack information on the precise year during which armored structures were placed only whether they were present during 2002 and or 2013 this leads to another potential source of endogeneity due to reverse temporal causation akin to a reflection effect 46 that is armoring on the parcel could have had a causal effect on the armoring of neighboring parcels although potential endogeneity of this type is often unacknowledged in empirical models it can nonetheless influence results common approaches to attenuate this type of endogeneity in panel data models such as the mundlak chamberlain technique 47 48 or the use of lagged variables do not apply to cases such as ours where each equation is estimated using only a single observation per parcel at one time period cf 19 while recognizing the potential for endogeneity of this type however it does not appear to influence our primary conclusions key model results and conclusions related to salt marsh effects on armoring are unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of variables on the armoring of neighboring parcels like 19 23 we find statistically significant neighborhood or spillover effects parcels with a greater proportion of armored neighbors are more likely to be armored themselves this influence from neighboring parcels is significant within only 500 m like results of the primary models in the main text results of the 0 distance threshold model table a 2 suggest that all else equal armoring is less likely to occur in areas suitable for salt marsh migration for example armoring is less likely to occur in areas suitable for salt marsh ecosystems marshplant and in areas with low wave energy wavenrgy low effects of currently proximate salt marsh sm100 m sm200 m are only significant in the model using 2002 observations the parameter for sm200 m is negative as anticipated and statistically significant at p 0 01 however the primary conclusions reported in the

8667,the value and vulnerability of salt marshes has led to efforts to ensure their preservation including the preservation of marsh transgression zones uplands onto which marshes can migrate and restrictions on shoreline armoring coastal armoring involves the placement of hardened structures such as revetments and bulkheads along the shoreline these structures can prevent coastal marshes from migrating onto adjacent uplands as sea levels rise thereby causing marsh loss over time hence efficient targeting of efforts to ensure marsh sustainability requires an understanding of where and why coastal armoring is likely to occur this article develops a random utility model that characterizes residential landowners shoreline armoring decisions for beachfront and non beachfront residential property focusing on whether armoring is influenced by features related to marsh migration the model is illustrated using parcel level data from accomack county virginia with armoring observations on each parcel for two time periods 2002 and 2013 independent models for the two time periods suggest that landowners in the case study area do not tend to construct armoring in ways that impede marsh migration all else equal armoring is less likely to occur in areas suitable for marsh migration rather armoring appears to be motivated primarily by factors associated with shoreline erosion risk such as high wave energy keywords adaptation armoring coastal economics salt marsh sea level rise 1 introduction the value of salt marsh ecosystems is recognized as an important motivation for coastal adaptation to sea level rise 1 10 until recently salt marshes have been largely resilient to changes in sea level due to natural adjustments in elevation via vegetation growth and sediment accretion and by migrating landward as sea levels rise 11 12 however there is increasing concern about impending loss of salt marsh given accelerated sea level rise with regional and global analyses forecasting up to a 20 45 marsh loss by 2100 13 14 given limits in the extent to which salt marshes can build elevation naturally and hence keep up with sea level rise in a single location the natural migration of salt marsh onto neighboring uplands is necessary for marsh persistence in many areas particularly under rapid sea level rise this migration requires the presence of marsh transgression zones undeveloped and non armored uplands onto which marshes can migrate landward as sea levels rise 3 coastal armoring that prevents marsh migration e g riprap revetments bulkheads can create a coastal squeeze wherein marshes progressively drown as they are trapped between these hardened structures and rising waters leading to gradual reduction of marsh extent over time 15 17 potential barriers to marsh migration are significant especially in regions such as the us atlantic coast where over 40 of land within 1 m above tidal wetlands is developed this is expected to increase in the future 18 from a purely biophysical perspective shoreline armoring e g the placement of bulkheads or revetments parallel to the shoreline can exacerbate salt marsh losses over time yet despite the potential for detrimental impacts on marsh ecosystems shoreline armoring may be viewed as an optimal decision from the perspective of private landowners seeking to protect property from erosion flooding marsh migration or other hazards 19 because many of the goods and services provided by salt marshes are public or quasi public goods 3 armoring decisions of this type may be privately optimal even if they lead to a net loss of social welfare due to diminished ecosystem services 20 however recent calls for urgent attention and pre emptive planning to set aside key coastal areas for wetland migration 21 p 49 imply that ongoing development and armoring are occurring in ways that threaten marsh migration over time public and private agencies have responded to these potential threats to coastal marsh persistence in multiple ways many of which seek to prevent or attenuate the potential effects of development and armoring that occurs on privately owned land for example in our case study area of virginia considerable effort has been made by public and private institutions to preserve salt marshes recognizing the potential impact of private shoreline development and armoring decisions on existing marshes and future marsh migration 22 among public actions the virginia department of conservation and recreation has created several natural area preserves for marsh conservation additionally virginia state law requires permit authorization for any private shoreline development or armoring project that impacts wetlands 1 1 per subtitle iii of title 28 2 of the code of virginia permits must be obtained from the virginia marine resources commission vmrc for any shoreline project that would potentially impact subaqueous or bottomlands tidal wetlands and coastal primary sand dunes 49 however although it is the state s responsibility to protect and manage coastal lands through virginia s coastal zone management program 2 2 the program established in 1986 is a network of state and local agencies which administer the enforceable laws and regulations that protect coastal resources including wetlands and armoring is controlled through the permitting process armoring by private landowners has increased in recent years see the data section below for more detail potential shoreline armoring by landowners has direct implications for future marsh migration under sea level rise on the additionality of land preservation for future marsh migration and hence on public agency decision making for salt marsh preservation 3 12 23 3 3 although this paper studies armoring decisions by private landowners public agencies can also choose to construct shoreline armoring in ways that affect marshes for example to prevent beach erosion or flooding of coastal communities 4 however as most us coastal land is privately owned actions to sustain coastal marshes tend to focus on preventing development and armoring on private land cf 3 yet despite the potential for future armoring to impact marsh loss over time e g by preventing upland marsh migration it is unclear whether human decisions to armor the coastline are currently being made in a way that threatens remaining marshes not all shoreline armoring affects potential marsh migration for example armoring structures built in areas subject to high wave energy and erosion potential may have minimal impact on marsh migration potential because high energy coastal areas of this type are not conducive to marsh survival 24 25 in contrast other types of hardened structures for example constructed directly upland of existing marsh systems may serve as impediments to marsh migration thereby causing a loss of marsh extent over time 12 26 26 provide illustrative examples of cases worldwide in which marshes are and are not impeded from migration due to the type of coastal armoring present in different locations analyses such as these show that the potential impact of shoreline armoring on coastal marshes depends on when and where these structures are built both of which are determined by landowner behavior duran et al 3 demonstrate how landowners choices to armor or not different types of coastal land directly influence optimal decisions regarding marsh conservation 4 4 application of the model in duran et al 3 requires assumptions on the extent to which private landowners will choose to armor different types of coastal land they discuss this issue explicitly in section 4 5 portfolio optimization under additionality because duran et al 3 do not have estimates of armoring probability they evaluate the sensitivity of model results to alternative assumptions on the likelihood of parcel armoring results developed here could enable the optimization of duran et al 3 to proceed without the need for these assumptions or associated sensitivity analyses despite the importance of these issues for coastal marsh sustainability the literature perhaps surprisingly provides little systematic empirical insight into the factors influencing coastal armoring decisions by property owners over time and whether these factors encourage the construction of armoring in locations where it is likely to impede marsh migration 3 27 among the few studies to address armoring decisions in general are 19 23 and 20 however as discussed below these studies provide limited insight into relationships between armoring decisions and potential marsh impacts other studies develop conceptual or theoretical frameworks that can be used to characterize coastal decision making in general situations but do not provide empirical results e g ref 4 thus while coastal armoring is widely acknowledged as a potential threat to salt marsh migration past work provides limited empirical insight into coastal armoring decisions in general and no direct information on whether armoring is likely to be constructed in ways that threaten salt marsh persistence to address this gap in the literature the present article develops a theoretically grounded discrete choice random utility model to evaluate the extent to which the armoring of coastal property is motivated by factors related to marsh migration we focus on coastal structures such as riprap revetments and bulkheads that are built roughly parallel to the shoreline and can hence serve as direct impediments to marsh migration the model considers whether recent behavioral patterns suggest that armoring on residential parcels is being constructed in locations that are likely to impede marsh migration it is estimated using geospatial and housing data from a case study of accomack county on virginia s eastern shore and capitalizes on a dataset with observations on shoreline armoring for two time periods 2002 and 2013 independent models are specified for each time period to determine the factors that motivated armoring in each period these outcomes are modeled as a function of independent variables that quantify each parcel s exposure to erosion flooding and marsh migration among other potential determinants of shoreline armoring the main model evaluates determinants of armoring observed on parcels as of 2013 the most recent date for which comprehensive armoring observations are available we then test robustness with an additional parallel model using armoring observations made roughly a decade prior in 2002 results provide robust evidence that armoring is less likely to occur in areas suitable for marsh migration the construction of armoring on or near a parcel is positively related to greater distances from salt marsh smaller proportions of nearby salt marsh in the surrounding landscape and areas that are poorly suited for salt marsh survival from an ecological perspective these results are robust to alternative model specifications and time periods results further suggest that the primary motivation for armoring in the case study area is protection against erosion and high wave energy factors negatively correlated with the presence of salt marsh these combined results suggest that while shoreline armoring can unquestionably prevent marsh migration from a biophysical perspective landowner behavior in the case study area shows that recent armoring has not been constructed primarily as a response to this migration 1 1 understanding drivers of shoreline armoring coastal armoring is widespread in the us occupying 12 to 30 of the total shorelines of individual states and reaching proportions of 50 70 or more along urban coasts 27 conceptually economists assume that armoring decisions by private landowners are motivated by anticipated benefits and costs as a function of the potential losses anticipated on unarmored parcels and the costs of building and maintaining armoring structures cf 28 29 for example there is evidence that houses near a rapidly eroding shore decline in value by 10 20 when compared to similar houses near stable shorelines 30 31 providing an economic incentive for shoreline protection 5 5 there is also evidence that homeowners with properties vulnerable to coastal risks i e low elevation and an eroding shoreline hold price premiums for the option to armor premiums of up to 22 were found for oregon coastal homeowners where state law prohibited armoring for properties developed after 1977 32 beyond general expectations such as these however there is limited research that seeks to understand the systematic behavioral drivers of this activity and whether these drivers tend to encourage armoring in locations that threaten particular types of coastal systems and services some of the major reported drivers of armoring include erosion storm surge and flooding 23 27 33 34 along with the structure s cost effectiveness and durability 20 although many of these arguments are not grounded in formal behavioral models of armoring decisions by landowners among the few articles to develop a formal behavioral model of shoreline armoring decisions grounded in economic theory is 19 who study the installation of beachfront protective structures on the oregon coast this prior work focuses on the potential for spatial spillovers in beachfront armoring decisions relying on a panel dataset of annual parcel data from 1990 to 2015 they find that the installation of beachfront armoring is influenced by a variety of factors related to geomorphology and erosion rates among other factors they also find neighboring parcel effects or spillovers to have an important influence 6 6 for example an unarmored landowner can be influenced by the perceived success or failure of his neighbor s armoring choice there is also the possibility of spillovers caused by the tendency of bulkheads and seawalls to deflect and transfer wave energy onto unarmored neighboring properties 19 35 perhaps the most closely related work to the present study is 23 who examine the determinants of armoring at the individual landowner level in an area where salt marsh is prevalent along the georgia estuarine coastline among the motivations for this prior study is to evaluate the drivers of armoring in a marsh dominated landscape motivated by potential impacts on marsh persistence this study combines data on coastal land parcels from 2016 and bulkhead and revetment armored structures from 2006 to 2013 identified through aerial imagery and on the ground field inspections using logistic regression similar to that presented here the study finds that shoreline slope elevation divided by the parcel s distance from the shoreline high energy shoreline environments and the presence of armored neighbors increase the likelihood of armoring although the study provides insight into factors relevant to both armoring and marsh migration potential such as wave energy the influence of salt marsh or variables directly related to marsh ecosystems on armoring is not directly examined earlier work by scyphers et al 2015 p 42 uses data from a survey of coastal homeowners in alabama to evaluate the most influential criteria for their decisions to maintain or modify their shoreline cost effectiveness durability aesthetics maintenance environmental impact water access permitting using tree based empirical classification models they argue that a neighbor s shoreline condition was the most powerful explanatory variable in predicting a homeowner s current shoreline condition a few other studies analyze large scale nationwide armoring patterns to explain drivers of habitat loss e g percentage of armored shoreline measured over the entire us coastline at the kilometer scale 27 however these studies are based solely on large scale correlations and are not intended to characterize individual e g property owner decision making although past work of this type provides evidence regarding the factors influencing private landowners armoring decisions none of these prior studies provide insight into behavioral drivers of shoreline armoring directly related to marsh migration potential in a mixed coastal landscape for example both 19 20 focus on the armoring of beachfront property which provides no direct insight into the behavior of landowners with property frontage on coastal marshes rather than beaches conversely peterson et al 23 focus on the armoring of estuarine coastal property where over 92 is dominantly fronted by salt marsh providing little variation in the armoring of parcels with and without salt marsh frontage hence the study does not consider whether or how the presence of salt marshes or the suitability of land for marsh migration influenced armoring behavior building on this prior work this article presents an empirical model of armoring decisions in a heterogeneous coastal landscape where coastal marsh migration is common and in which armoring could at least in principle be constructed in ways to prevent this migration among our primary research questions is whether armoring is constructed in locations that tend to affect marshes or potential marsh migration or in other types of locations where marshes are unlikely to exist now or in the future we also consider potential drivers related to marsh migration potential together with those related to erosion and storm surge flood risk the goal is to evaluate whether the primary motivator of armoring stems from preventing erosion flooding or marsh migration as indicated by factors relevant to each the analysis is grounded in a theoretical model of landowners shoreline armoring decisions with general parallels to prior work however there are important distinctions between the presented model and those found in prior work reflecting differences in objectives decision contexts and data for example 23 do not present a formal theoretical model to underpin their empirical analysis however their choice of variables has conceptual grounding in microeconomic theory with armoring installation specified as a function of variables associated with perceived risks and benefits cost and demographic social factors despite these general similarities to the empirical specification presented here the empirical model of 23 omits variables directly related to the current and potential future presence of marshes which are primary focus of the present study as a second example 19 emphasize the role of spatial spillovers in landowners armoring decisions over time using a long term panel of annual observations on beachfront parcels in oregon 7 7 corresponding to this data structure they develop a real options framework of armoring decisions over time this framework informs a reduced form panel data regression model designed to address concerns such as the potential endogeneity of peer group formation over time simultaneity of landowner decision making and the specification of peer effects 19 in contrast our focus is on the effect of largely time invariant dimensions of coastal geomorphology related to marsh presence and migration potential on the observed armoring of parcels as of 2002 and 2013 we hence orient the theoretical framework around a random utility model of the armoring decision during each period focusing primarily on the latter period unlike 19 we do not emphasize potential neighboring spillovers due to the armoring of nearby parcels although a model of this type is illustrated in an appendix as a robustness check 1 2 a model of landowner armoring decisions we begin by outlining the theoretical framework that underlies empirical estimation the empirical characterization of landowners armoring choices is grounded in a simple random utility model of armoring decisions that emphasizes characteristics of the property relevant to marsh migration among other potentially relevant factors we assume that each landowner makes decisions for a single parcel and focus on decisions made at any given time t within the context of this decision the landowner s utility is specified u r a z n m c and is assumed to be a function of the net present value of anticipated future property losses on the parcel due to coastal hazards such as flooding erosion and marsh incursion r the capitalized total cost of armoring 8 8 we assume that armoring costs include the present value of all construction and maintenance costs c and income m the variable r in utility can be thought of as the capitalized value of the future flow of all anticipated losses on the parcel as a function of armoring on the parcel a armoring on neighboring properties n and a vector of environmental topographical hydrodynamic and other biophysical factors that influence these anticipated losses z here a 1 denotes an armored parcel and a 0 denotes an unarmored parcel 9 9 we treat armoring as a binary outcome and abstract from issues related to the proportion of the parcel that might be armored in general we anticipate that r a 0 r n 0 with the latter expectation motivated by the tendency of armoring on parcels to deflect wave energy and increase erosion on neighboring land ceteris paribus 19 the expected effect of elements of z on r varies depending on the variable in question we further assume that u r 0 and u c 0 so that utility declines with anticipated damage to the parcel and with expenditures on armoring the marginal utility of income is assumed to be positive given this model we assume the landowner will armor the parcel if 1 u r a 1 z n m c u r a 0 z n m where the absence of armoring implies no armoring cost c 0 that is the landowner chooses to install armor if the anticipated utility derived with armoring is greater than utility anticipated with an unarmored parcel considering both the present value of anticipated property loss and armoring cost implicit in 1 is an understanding that this decision is made at a given time period t and that the decision is irreversible in the relevant planning horizon that is once a parcel is armored we assume that it is prohibitively expensive to remove the armoring structure 1 2 1 modelling the armoring decision making process grounded in this random utility framework we present a model in which all parcels are observed at a single time period t at which point they are either observed to be armored or unarmored to enable econometric analysis for this case we rely on the standard assumption that utility is composed of a deterministic component v and a stochastic component ε equation 1 thus becomes 2 v r a 1 z n m c ε a 1 v r a 0 z n m ε a 0 grounded in 2 one can specify the probability that armoring will be installed as of t 1 and hence observed p a 1 as 3 p a 1 p ε a 0 ε a 1 v r a 1 z n m c v r a 0 z n m if one assumes that stochastic utility components follow a type 1 extreme value distribution this probability may be modeled empirically using a conditional logit model with two choice alternatives 36 where p is specified as a logistic function of the observable utility difference for each landowner i given by 4 δ v v r a i 1 z i n i m i c i v r a i 0 z i n i m i we make the simplifying assumptions that utility and hence the utility difference is linear in the parameters and further that the damage function r may be specified in simple linear form as r a i z i μ 0 ai n i μ 1 a i for a i 0 1 where μ 0 ai and μ 1 a i are parameters conforming vectors or scalars 10 10 hence the anticipated reduction in the net present value of loss r when the parcel becomes armored may be specified as r a i 1 r a i 0 z i μ 0 ai 1 n i μ 1 a i 1 z i μ 0 ai 0 n i μ 1 a i 0 z i μ 0 ai 1 μ 0 ai 0 n i μ 1 a i 1 μ 1 a i 0 because we are considering a relatively homogeneous set of armoring structures bulkheads and revetments on one case study area we make an additional simplifying assumption that per unit e g per linear meter armoring costs do not vary across parcels 11 11 cost information is unavailable for these structures and hence this assumption cannot be validated in the present study however prior work supports assumptions of this type at least in general for example 19 find no significant parcel level variation in the cost of armoring installation when examining 2136 beachfront properties in tillamook and lincoln oregon given these assumptions the cost of shoreline armoring may be specified as a linear function of parcel shoreline frontage or alternatively size f i where f i is the relevant measure of parcel frontage or size that determines total armoring cost finally we assume that vector z i biophysical factors that influence anticipated losses is composed of a set of sub vectors e i s i m i x i and f i here e i is a vector of variables affecting anticipated erosion risk s i is a vector of variables affecting anticipated flood risk m i is a vector of variables affecting the anticipated risk of marsh migration on the property and x i is a vector of additional conditions that influence the perceived benefits of armoring note that because parcel frontage f i influences both the benefits and costs of armoring the net effect of this variable on utility and hence armoring probability is ambiguous grounded in this model straightforward manipulations yield the empirical reduced form utility difference equation to be estimated 5 δ v β 0 β 1 e i β 2 s i β 3 m i β 4 x i β 5 n i β 6 f i ε i where the betas represent reduced form parameter vectors and scalars to be estimated 12 12 theoretically each of these reduced form parameters to be estimated is defined as a function of underlying structural parameters for example based on the above specification and assumptions the reduced form parameter β 5 on n i may be defined as a theoretical function of underlying structural parameters θ μ 1 a 1 i μ 1 a 0 i where θ is the marginal utility of reductions in anticipated damage r available data do not allow the underlying structural parameters to be identified without additional maintained assumptions so estimation focuses on the reduced form of the behavioral equation 13 13 landowner income m i does not depend on armoring status and hence drops out of the linear utility difference equation δ v as noted above the model is estimated as a two alternative binary conditional logit model with huber white robust standard errors the dependent variable for estimation a i is set equal to one if a riprap or bulkhead armored structure is installed on parcel i by a specified date and zero otherwise 1 3 the data the models are estimated using data from a case study in accomack county the county is part of a narrow peninsula between the atlantic ocean and the chesapeake bay on the eastern shore of virginia usa this case study area was chosen due to its large areas of coastal marsh that are potentially vulnerable to a combination of sea level rise and local decisions to armor the shoreline coastal wetlands including salt marsh habitats in this region are threatened by sea level rise and increasing rates of shoreline hardening 3 and are among the primary targets for local conservation 22 average annual sea level rise in the eastern shore is estimated to be over twice the global average leading to additional concerns over the sustainability of marsh ecosystems 37 38 14 14 average sea level rise in the eastern shore is approximately 4 0 mm per year compared to a global average of 1 7 mm per year modeling in duran vinent et al 3 suggests that the extent of armoring on land suitable for marsh migration will be a critical determinant of future marsh extent in the area a substantial portion of the virginia shoreline is already armored or developed 15 15 as of 2009 approximately 793 km or 11 of virginia tidal waters had been hardened or armored with 29 km of shoreline hardened each year if current shoreline hardening trends continue 9 to 18 of additional shoreline is predicted to be hardened 50 100 years into the future 39 and accomack county has experienced a general upward trend in the number of permits issued to individuals for the construction of riprap and bulkhead armored structures fig 1 16 16 our current data do not allow issued permits to be linked to specific observed armoring structures hence we cannot determine the relationship between issued permits and observed armoring however there are multiple reasons why there is not a one to one relationship between issued permits and observed armoring in each year for example some permits allow multiple armoring structures to be built in other cases permits can be issued to restore or refurbish existing armoring structures rather than build new ones for reasons such as these determining relationships between observed armoring and issued permits would require historical analysis beyond the scope of the current data 17 17 although recent years 2019 2020 have shown a decrease in the number of issued permits relative to some prior years this may be part of the year to year fluctuations that have been occurring since the early 1990 s representing natural variation rather than a structural break in the long term upward trend however it might also suggest changing trends on permit requests while data suggest that shoreline armoring is ongoing however it is unclear whether these structures are being constructed in ways that potentially impact coastal marshes as noted above we restrict the analysis to parcels classified as single family residential to ensure homogeneity the data were further screened to include only parcels with a size of 20 acres or smaller with homes built prior to 2013 since the outcome of interest relies on changes in armoring status prior to that time parcels without coastal exposure were excluded where exposure was defined to include all parcels within a 20 m distance of the coast we allow for non zero distances 20 m to accommodate the fact that the risk of future erosion storm surge flooding and marsh migration is not limited to parcels with current coastal frontage 0 m distance preliminary models were estimated with different cutoffs for coastal exposure and frontage showing largely robust results for different distances between 0 and 20 m after screening the final sample includes 1665 coastal single family parcels the size and location of the parcels armored structures and current salt marsh habitats are illustrated in fig 2 to evaluate the determinants of shoreline armoring for these parcels an original dataset was developed combining information on single family residential parcels land cover and shoreline structures data on single family residential parcels was taken from the accomack county office of the assessor using virginia s gis clearinghouse hosted by the virginia geographic information network 18 18 http data virginia gov datasets 8e222d4ffbea4f8ba552a089866ec11f these data included tax parcel data and land ownership polygons with information such as the parcel location dwelling value land value land use property owner acreage improvements and structural housing characteristics land cover information was obtained from sources including the national wetlands inventory and the virginia department of conservation and recreation flood zone information was taken from the federal emergency management agency 19 19 fema sfha special flood hazard area flood zone designations are commonly used to define variables for economic valuation and other types of modeling as done here however realized flood risks and economic effects e g on housing values for individual parcels can vary even within areas with the same or similar sfha designations 40 41 because the present data do not allow micro scale quantification of flood risk beyond current sfha designations we proceed with analysis based on these designations we acknowledge that improved measures of flood risk for each parcel could potentially support more refined estimates of flood risk effects on armoring but leave such analysis for future work information on shoreline structures was obtained from the virginia institute of marine science s vims shoreline inventory reports sir from 2002 to 2016 and accomack county shoreline management model smm from 2016 42 43 20 20 the vims sir 2016 data was published in 2016 and includes shoreline structure information from the spring of 2013 using aerial satellite imagery 42 43 the vims sir 2002 data was recorded through observations in the field taken by boat along the shoreline using a gps tracker this is based on correspondence with gis programmer analyst tamia rudnicky a member of the team that compiled the shoreline data at the vims the sirs contained information on land use and shoreline conditions the presence of beaches and shoreline structures these included bulkheads riprap wharfs groins jetties and unconventional protection structures the smm contained data on the presence or absence of tidal marsh forested riparian buffers bank vegetation cover wave exposure fetch and nearshore water depth bathymetric data unlike the sir data which included shoreline structure information at two points in time 2002 and 2013 the smm data only included shoreline conditions at one point in time 2013 due to this data limitation we require the assumption that shoreline conditions remain effectively constant over the period covered by the analysis i e parcels armored by 2002 and parcels armored by 2013 are influenced by similar shoreline conditions for this reason we also consider the 2013 model to be more reliable and hence the primary model for deriving our results and conclusions as described above the outcome of interest is whether a parcel is observed to have revetments e g riprap or bulkheads within 20 m of the parcel edge defined as an armored parcel this allows for the possibility that relevant armoring structures may be observed in areas that are between a parcel and the water but that are nonetheless outside of the legally recognized parcel boundary 21 21 this also enables the data to capture the presence of armoring structures for which minor variations in geocoding or parcel boundaries within gis data layers cause the structure to mistakenly appear as outside the parcel boundary when in fact it is located on the parcel alternative preliminary models were also estimated where a zero distance threshold was used to identify armored parcels armoring is observed within the legal parcel boundary these models have poorer statistical fit than those with a 20 m threshold although results regarding salt marsh see below are largely robust 22 22 the only exception regards proportions of salt marsh near the parcel although proportions of salt marsh within 100 or 200 m of a parcel was found to influence armoring decisions in all of the 20 m threshold models this was never the case in the 0 m threshold logit models all other key results are robust and the primary conclusions of the analysis do not change due to the improved empirical performance we proceed with models that use a 20 m threshold to assign armored status for purposes of defining the dependent variable s models which use the alternative 0 m threshold to assign armored status can be found in the appendix dependent variables are defined using these underlying armoring measures arm13 is assigned a value of 1 if the parcel was observed to be armored by 2013 and a 0 otherwise and arm02 is defined similarly for parcels armored by 2002 23 23 note that these dependent variables are defined based on physically observable armoring on the parcel this eliminates the possibility of recall or other biases associated with the potential use of survey responses or other indirect approaches to identify armored parcels in doing so it is assumed that the owners of each parcel make decisions on whether to armor that parcel independent variables hypothesized to have potential influence on armoring decisions include environmental factors that increase the risk of property loss from erosion wavenrgy low storm surge flood fld and marsh migration marshplant smdist sm100 m sm200 m and factors that potentially mitigate these risks elev forestshore smdist sm100 m sm200 m and beachdist also included are non environmental factors related to the parcel that influence these risks such as its assessed dwelling value dwlgvall 24 24 this is defined as the assessed value of the dwelling itself the structure based on features such as the house size and quality of the building materials we use dwelling value rather than property value in the model to allay endogeneity concerns related to potential two way causal relationships between property values and the presence of armoring see discussion in ref 19 and exposure to the coast coast frnt lastly parcel armoring might be affected by whether its neighbors parcels are armored and this is examined in neighb500 m and neighb1km allowing for the possibility of spillover effects 19 neighb500 m and neighb1km are defined as proportions 25 25 unlike counts of armored neighbors proportions are not confounded by the density of a neighborhood of neighbors armored within 500 and 1000 m of a parcel since the definition of armored changes between models these spillover variables are altered accordingly i e proportions of neighbors armored by 2013 and 2002 using either 20 or 0 m distance thresholds between the parcel and the structure these neighboring spillover variables are not included in the primary models in the main text but are included as a robustness check in the appendix table 1 provides a list of variables used and their descriptions descriptive statistics shown in table 2 highlight the differences between coastal single family homes that were arm13 1 and were not arm13 0 armored by 2013 the full sample includes both groups for the full sample the average parcel had a dwelling value dwlgval1 of 159 739 in 2018 usd and was on average 1 744 acres acreage in size on average 23 1 of land within 200 m of parcels was salt marsh sm200 m most parcels were in flood zones fld and in areas with low wave energy wavenrgy low at 84 0 and 59 6 respectively lastly parcels had on average 20 2 of their neighbors within 500 m armored by 2013 approximately 50 of parcels were armored by 2013 showing considerable variation in this variable as anticipated an initial evaluation of variable means suggests systematic univariate differences between parcels that were armored or not for example the mean elevation elev of parcels that become armored is lower at 1 019 m compared to 1 390 m for parcels that were never armored parcels that become armored also seem to be at higher risk of erosion relative to those that never have armor since only 47 5 are in a shoreline with low wave energy wavenrgy low compared to 71 7 for parcels that were not armored in another example 59 2 of parcels that become armored are in areas suitable for planting salt marsh marshplant compared to 98 0 for parcels that were not armored wilcoxon rank sum tests are used to determine whether the environmental and parcel characteristics in the samples of armored and unarmored parcels are likely to derive from the same population results from these tests reject the null hypotheses p 0 01 and indicate statistically significant differences in the observed characteristics 1 3 1 robustness and endogeneity as discussed by prior works such as 19 44 analyses of spatial decisions such as these are complex and it is important to verify the robustness of results to various types of statistical concerns recognizing this complexity the presented models were developed after the estimation of multiple alternative exploratory models to evaluate the robustness of our conclusions regarding the influence of coastal geomorphology on armoring focusing on landscape attributes relevant to salt marsh migration as noted above we also present parallel models for our two time periods primary robustness checks and results are presented below and in the appendix for example key model results and conclusions are unchanged regardless of the inclusion or exclusion of variables on the armoring of neighboring parcels neighb500 m and neighb1km since these variables pose additional endogeneity concerns see the appendix for a detailed discussion and do not influence our hypothesis tests on the effect of conditions related to marsh migration our primary logit model results omit these variables in general all exploratory models and those used for robustness testing verify the key conclusions presented below 2 results table 3 presents conditional logit model results with the dependent variables arm13 and arm02 given that the latter model entails an additional caveat regarding the accuracy of its results 26 26 since data on shoreline characteristics were only available for 2013 this model requires the assumption that similar conditions held for armoring that took place by 2002 we focus the primary discussion on arm13 the second column and use arm02 the first column as a robustness check a wald chi square test indicates that the overall model is significant χ 2 449 94 p 0 01 results for statistically significant variables comport with prior expectations derived from theory and intuition for example higher dwelling values and greater coastal exposure raise the probability of a riprap or bulkhead revetment being observed on or near the parcel as of 2013 as both conditions increase anticipated losses on unarmored parcels due to coastal hazards parameter estimates from the 2013 model suggest that many parcel features related to erosion storm surge flood and marsh migration risk have statistically significant influences on armoring probability for example parcels located in areas with low wave energy wavenrgy low and hence low erosion risk are less likely to be armored similar results are found for parcels protected from erosion by a forested shoreline forestshore parcels with a higher elevation elev are also less likely to be armored this is intuitive because higher elevation parcels are less vulnerable to many types of coastal hazards lastly parcels further from beaches beachdist are more likely to be armored which may be due to erosion protection in the case of wide beaches and or a desire to maintain the aesthetics of parcels closer to beaches which may be devalued with armoring 27 27 proportions of beach within 100 and 200 m of parcels were included in preliminary models but were either not statistically significant or dropped due to a lack of nonzero observations the average home was over 9 km from the nearest beach 28 28 results for 2002 also suggest that larger parcels were less likely to be armored as of that year acreage this effect however becomes insignificant as of 2013 it is possible that small parcels were more likely to be armored by 2002 because the structure home in smaller parcels is more likely to be close to the shoreline and hence more directly threatened by coastal flooding or erosion ceteris paribus however as we do not have data on the specific location of housing structures within each parcel as of 2002 we do not have a means to test this assertion directly the key hypotheses of interest however relate to whether armoring decisions are being made in systematic ways that threaten salt marshes for example that would prevent marshes from migrating onto suitable upland areas theory alone provides no clear expectation on the direction or magnitude of these effects on the one hand variables positively related to salt marsh migration could increase armoring likelihood if landowners perceive future marsh migration is a risk to structures or property value on the other hand marsh presence can provide natural protection from storm surge and flooding thereby reducing the need for armoring structures 2 the net effect of marsh related variables on parcel armoring depends on how landowners perceive and balance offsetting effects such as these this model draws insights on this question based on whether parcels were armored or not as of 2013 results provide evidence that armoring is being constructed in systematic ways that tend not to threaten salt marshes for example the positive and statistically significant parameter p 0 01 on smdist suggest that parcels are more likely to have armored structures placed near them when located further away from salt marshes the negative and significant p 0 01 parameter estimate on sm100 m suggests that larger proportions of marsh land cover within 100 m are associated with a reduced probability of armoring similarly the negative and significant parameter p 0 01 on marshplant indicates that armoring is more likely in areas that are not ecologically suitable for the survival of salt marsh we also find evidence that armoring tends to be constructed in areas with moderate or high wave energy wavenrgy low 0 areas that tend to be poorly suited to marsh sustainability nearly all marsh related results are robust when compared to those from a similar logit model predicting armoring by 2002 shown in the first column of table 3 we find consistent results for smdist marshplant wavenrgy low forestshore and coast frnt however there are some differences in other results suggesting that some types of armoring patterns may have changed over time for example the negative and significant p 0 01 parameter estimate on sm200 m in the 2002 model suggests that larger proportions of marsh land cover within 200 m were associated with a reduced probability of armoring in 2002 furthermore elev and dwlgval1 were not significant determinants of armoring during the earlier period these results suggest that armoring in the studied area tends not to be constructed in areas suitable for marsh migration they do not imply that armoring never influences marshes in the case study area or that marsh preservation is not a relevant concern only that the systematic component of armoring decisions observed in 2002 and 2013 led to the placement of armoring in locations that were less suitable for marsh migration in general 3 conclusion although the empirical results presented above apply to the studied area on the us east coast the methods developed here can be potentially applied to any coastal location for which suitable observations on parcel armoring are available moreover unlike methods such as those in ref 19 that require annual observations on parcel armoring for an extended period data unavailable for most coastal locations the presented approach only requires a single observation per parcel at one time period hence while we cannot provide the type of temporal insight possible with annual parcel armoring data over extended periods the illustrated method is more broadly applicable although the present study focuses on marsh migration this method could be adapted to study multiple topics of interest related to armoring decisions focusing on our primary hypotheses of interest results in the present case provide robust evidence that armoring in the studied area is motivated primarily by biophysical factors that influence hazard exposure such as exposure to parcel erosion due to high wave energy results do not suggest that armoring is being constructed to reduce the risk of marsh migration onto a property in fact the opposite seems to be happening coastal properties are more likely to have riprap revetments or bulkheads or be near these structures when they are located further away from salt marsh around smaller proportions of salt marsh and in areas less suited for planting salt marsh areas less likely to have marsh migration as shown in the appendix these results are robust to the inclusion of variables designed to capture neighboring spillover effects this finding does not imply that shoreline armoring is unimportant to future marsh migration or that actions should not be taken to preserve marsh transgression zones for example other types of human actions can negatively influence the potential upland migration of marshes and some types of armoring in the case study area do affect marshes however results do imply the importance of understanding how and why landowners choose to armor their parcels when designing policies and programs to sustain coastal marshes for example duran vinent et al 3 show that findings of this type affect the additionality of actions taken to ensure future marsh persistence there are multiple possible explanations for these observed patterns first as noted above salt marsh is known to provide natural protection from coastal hazards such as flooding and erosion 1 2 these ecosystem services may reduce the perceived need to armor a parcel against these other threats like 19 23 we find evidence that erosion is a primary concern when choosing whether to armor parcels the same patterns may lead to tendencies not to armor near marshes second as in many states virginia imposes monetary penalties and or requires mitigation for shoreline armoring with negative marsh impacts wetlands mitigation compensation policy and supplemental guidelines 2005 29 29 see https www vims edu ccrm wetlands mgmt docs permit fees2020 pdf these penalties provide a negative incentive for armoring in the vicinity of marshes finally unlike erosion that can occur quickly e g due to coastal storm events marsh migration is a slow process that may be viewed as less of a risk to property value and structures hence given the other factors discussed above landowners may perceive less of an urgent need to armor against marsh migration compared to other hazards although these results provide useful and previously unavailable insight regarding the influence of marsh migration and other determinants of armoring in general several caveats should be considered when interpreting model results first data collection methods used to identify armoring differed somewhat between the 2002 and 2013 data collection efforts each with their own advantages and disadvantages 30 30 the 2002 shoreline information was collected using direct visual inspection of structures the 2013 shoreline information was collected via high resolution remote sensing these differences could be a potential source of unanticipated variation in the dependent variables second results using the model of armoring by 2002 are only valid under the assumption that biophysical shoreline conditions in 2002 were similar to conditions in 2013 major differences in shoreline conditions could lead to measurement error in some regressors third although this research sheds light on whether armoring is taking place in locations that could potentially affect marsh migration it says nothing about whether those revetment or bulkhead structures actually prevent marsh migration there are many factors that make these structures more or less effective in this regard such as its relative height when compared to the tidal range 31 31 tidal wetlands only grow up to 1 5 times the tidal range in all of virginia with few exceptions in the chincoteague bay area of accomack county where the tidal range is under 1 foot this is based on the expert opinion of hank badger of the vmrc and its placement on the landward marsh edge 45 it is also important to recognize that these models are defined based on armoring observed on the ground not on reports of armoring by individual landowners we do not have direct information on who made decisions to construct each armoring structure only the parcels that are on or proximate to those structures the model assumes implicitly that the owners of parcels made armoring decisions based on the characteristics of each parcel finally the model does not include factors that may influence variations in the cost of armoring across parcels including for example the contractor used its size and materials data on any potential variations in cost is unavailable and hence could not be included in the model we leave extensions to address these and other potential limitations for future research despite these caveats the presented results have potentially important implications for policies designed to limit armoring with a goal of reducing impacts to salt marshes the finding that armoring is less likely to occur near salt marsh may indicate the success of current policy restrictions such as through permit authorization that provide incentives to minimize marsh impacts or may reflect the natural protections offered by salt marshes regardless of the explanation findings presented here highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics between armoring and marsh migration for conservation agencies and policymakers looking to preserve salt marshes if coastal parcels remain unarmored and undeveloped into the future land preservation may not be required to enable salt marsh migration under sea level rise to provide further guidance on where preservation may be needed a dynamic model of armoring decision making that can be tailored to future sea level rise and land use scenarios is required improved understanding of the forces that motivate parcel armoring decisions can help policies target actions that are likely to have the greatest net benefit in terms of protecting these valued systems credit authorship contribution

influence the work reported in this paper appendix armoring definitions neighboring spillovers and potential endogeneity to demonstrate the robustness of results presented in the main text tables a 1 a 2 and a3 include alternative models that incorporate 1 different distance thresholds to identify armored versus unarmored parcels and 2 variables to capture neighboring spillover effects 19 with the variables neighb500 m and neighb1km reflecting proportions of armored neighbors model a 1 reproduces the models in the main text with the addition of neighb500 m and neighb1km model a 2 reproduces the same models but defines an armored parcel based on the existence of armoring within 0 m of the parcel edge rather than the 20 m threshold used for the primary models model a 3 incorporates both changes neighboring spillovers and a revised distance threshold to define armoring all models demonstrate the robustness of the general conclusions reported in the main text when considering neighboring spillover effects tables a1 and a 3 it is important to recognize that regressors of this type can be endogenous for example if an unobserved characteristic simultaneously influences armoring decisions on neighboring parcels 19 44 we also lack information on the precise year during which armored structures were placed only whether they were present during 2002 and or 2013 this leads to another potential source of endogeneity due to reverse temporal causation akin to a reflection effect 46 that is armoring on the parcel could have had a causal effect on the armoring of neighboring parcels although potential endogeneity of this type is often unacknowledged in empirical models it can nonetheless influence results common approaches to attenuate this type of endogeneity in panel data models such as the mundlak chamberlain technique 47 48 or the use of lagged variables do not apply to cases such as ours where each equation is estimated using only a single observation per parcel at one time period cf 19 while recognizing the potential for endogeneity of this type however it does not appear to influence our primary conclusions key model results and conclusions related to salt marsh effects on armoring are unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of variables on the armoring of neighboring parcels like 19 23 we find statistically significant neighborhood or spillover effects parcels with a greater proportion of armored neighbors are more likely to be armored themselves this influence from neighboring parcels is significant within only 500 m like results of the primary models in the main text results of the 0 distance threshold model table a 2 suggest that all else equal armoring is less likely to occur in areas suitable for salt marsh migration for example armoring is less likely to occur in areas suitable for salt marsh ecosystems marshplant and in areas with low wave energy wavenrgy low effects of currently proximate salt marsh sm100 m sm200 m are only significant in the model using 2002 observations the parameter for sm200 m is negative as anticipated and statistically significant at p 0 01 however the primary conclusions reported in the

method which elicits citizens preferences over the allocation of public budgets as well as their private income in a pve citizens are asked to choose the best portfolio of projects given a governmental and a private budget constraint first this paper aligns pve with the traditional kaldor hicks welfare economics framework underlying many cost benefit analyses second this paper positions pve against other valuation methods third this paper applies the pve method to evaluate the impacts of projects mitigating flood risks in the netherlands this empirical application reveals that dutch citizens indicate a preference for projects that combine strengthening dikes and give space to the river to flood safely particularly when such projects positively influence biodiversity and recreational opportunities keywords participatory value evaluation cost benefit analysis valuation methods flood protection biodiversity environmental valuation 1 introduction in virtually all western countries cost benefit analysis cba is nowadays considered the gold standard for supporting public decision making 1 in various countries such as the united kingdom the netherlands and sweden cba is mandatory when national funding is required for large transport projects 2 cba is also widely applied to governmental decisions on environmental policies safety regulation and water management 3 5 for instance cba has been used to inform policies regarding flood protection marine protection water quality management biodiversity and environmental conservation in the united kingdom 5 the theoretical foundations of cba are rooted in welfare economics which is a branch of economics that investigates the social desirability of alternative economic outcomes 6 a cba is built on the kaldor hicks efficiency criterion 7 which recommends projects where the sum of monetary gains outweigh the sum of monetary losses such that winners can potentially compensate the losers and still be better off the conversion of positive and negative social impacts of government projects into monetary units relies on willingness to pay wtp and willingness to accept wta estimates several scholars criticize the wtp wta valuation methods by arguing that they take a too narrow perspective when evaluating government projects because choices individuals make with their private income might not accurately reflect their preferences towards public policy 8 10 to resolve this issue scholars developed so called willingness to allocate public budget experiments wtapb in which individuals make choices when faced with effects accruing from alternative allocations of government budget 11 13 the wtapb approach aims to infer welfare effects of government projects from individuals preferences regarding the expenditure of public euros participatory value evaluation pve is a survey method which interconnects the wtp wta and the wtapb valuation paradigm the similarity between wtapb experiments and pve experiments is that participants are asked to express which public projects should be financed from a limited amount of public budget the most important difference between these two approaches is that participants in a pve have the option to advise the government against allocating the budget to any or some of the projects that are considered in the pve and shift the remaining budget to the next year or to other government departments in addition to this fixed budget pve format the flexible budget pve format allows participants to adjust the size of the public budget and thereby their private after tax income by changing taxes the contribution of the flexible budget pve format is that the wtp valuation paradigm and the wtapb valuation paradigm are integrated in a single valuation framework that is the desirability of government projects is established simultaneously through the elicitation of individuals preferences over the allocation of an earmarked public budget as well as their private income dekker et al 14 present the econometric and microeconomic framework which allows for a social welfare analysis of government projects included in fixed and flexible budget pve experiments although the social welfare approach is our preferred way of interpreting the results from a pve study a key connection that needs to be made is the extent to which any derived measure of consumer surplus from a pve study can be aligned with the kaldor hicks efficiency framework to this end and this is the first aim of this paper we develop a stylised model in section 2 extending the work of bergstrom et al 13 section 3 continues with a qualitative discussion positioning pve relative to other valuation methods as a second contribution this paper presents a case study focusing on the policy evaluation features of pve section 4 the case study concerns flood protection schemes of the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management the main aim of the case study is to provide a tangible example of the pve method section 4 also discusses the experiences of participants and policy makers section 5 provides a discussion this paper does not aim to draw the conclusion that pve is a better or worse method compared to other methods we also do not aim to compare policy recommendations produced by a pve and standard cba as this particular question is investigated in mouter et al 15 2 participatory value evaluation and the connection with welfare economics in this subsection we introduce two alternative versions of participatory value evaluation pve and build upon the framework presented by bergstrom et al 13 allowing us to align pve to the kaldor hicks welfare economics framework respondents in a pve are requested to select their optimal bundle of public goods q where spending public budget on the bundle q implies that less budget can be spend on other public goods z the fixed budget pve requires respondents to allocate a fixed public budget across alternative public goods the flexible budget pve provides respondents the additional opportunity to increase or decrease the public budget by recommending the government to levy a collective tax increase reduction we define z as the spending of the remainder of the public budget on future public projects alternative formulations are possible where z is the remainder of the public budget that is available for spending in other departments of the local government since the exact spending of z is not defined it is treated as a numeraire or composite public good which satisfies the public budget constraint in the flexible budget pve setting an additional numeraire or composite private good x is introduced alongside a tax increase or a reduction which results in an increase of the public budget given our focus on evaluating public investments in public goods the exact spending of the private budget is irrelevant and the introduction of a numeraire private good is sufficient the introduction of a public and private numeraire good enables to firmly root pve in the context of welfare economics and related measures of consumer surplus 2 1 behavioral model fixed budget pve following bergstrom et al 13 we define the direct utility function u n for individual n in a fixed budget pve as 1 1 it is assumed that the private budget decisions do not influence the available public budget in the fixed budget pve and therefore x is disregarded in the present subsection 1 u n u n q z the public budget constraint b for the fixed pve experiment is defined by 2 b q p z where q is a vector of binary variables indicating which projects have been included in the policy portfolio and p is the corresponding price vector z is the numeraire public good that completes the public budget constraint assuming the individual is utility maximising we can summarise the fixed pve decision problem as follows 3 max q z u n u n q z subject to b q p z the solution to the above maximisation problem provides a set of conditional marshallian demand functions q p b and z p b which when plugged into the direct utility function provides the conditional indirect or optimal utility function v n 4 v n v n p b the corresponding conditional public expenditure function e can under the assumption that the public budget is exhausted be obtained by inverting the conditional indirect utility function for a given optimal utility level v n 5 e e p v n following the definition of bergstrom et al 13 we can define the impact of a price or quality change of the public goods in q as a compensating tax reallocation ctr 6 c t r e p 0 v n 0 e p 1 v n 0 in terms of the hicksian measures of welfare change the ctr measure is comparable with the compensating surplus given that we are contrasting against the original level of utility v n 0 and are generally considered with quality changes rather than price changes relative to bergstrom et al 2004 the fixed budget pve explicitly incorporates the notion of the numeraire public good into the data elicitation process the benefits of doing so are discussed in more detail in section 3 3 2 2 behavioral model flexible budget pve in flexible budget pve experiments the respondent can adjust the size of the public budget through the tax system and hence private consumption x n and the private budget constraint become relevant we can reformulate the utility maximisation problem to 7 max q x n z τ n u n u n q x n z subject to b n τ n q p z m n x n τ n where x n is demand for the composite private good with unit price τ n is a tax or tax rebate which can be imposed to increase decrease the public budget and m n is income for individual n for simplicity the design of the tax system is assumed to be exogenous the two budget constraints can be combined to reflect the total public and private budget e t available in the economy 8 e t b n m n q p z n x n solving the utility maximisation problem provides the marshallian demand functions q p b m z p b m and x n p b m where m is the vector of disposable income for all individuals in the population these demand functions can again be used to arrive at the conditional indirect or optimal utility function 9 v n v n p b m in the absence of non paternalistic altruistic preferences it can be assumed that v n m j 0 j n the private budget available to other individuals in the population for consumption does not influence the value obtained by individual n from consuming the public goods q and z and neither do changes in the income of individual j allow individual n to consume more of good x n and thereby derive a higher level of utility given these assumptions the indirect utility function then only depends on the income level of individual n and reduces to 10 v n v n p b m n the corresponding expenditure function for individual n representing the total budget clearly shows this separation and can be defined as 2 2 note that e n does consider the individuals optimal decision from the collective tax which increases the public budget 11 e n j n m j e n p v n the total budget expenditure formulation above highlights that private and public money are completely fungible i e a euro is a euro the tax system allows converting private budget into public budget and vice versa the flexible budget pve format thus allows to adjust changes in the public budget b and the private budget m n to reach a given level of utility under the assumption that there are no deadweight losses associated with the collection of public funds via taxation this respectively corresponds to the referred ctr welfare measure and the traditional consumer surplus cs measure the fungibility of money in the flexible budget pve framework ensures ctr is equivalent to cs bergstrom et al 13 relates the traditional cs measure to the case of financing a public good or its change in price quantity etc entirely from private budgets i e by means of a special tax the ctr welfare measure relates to financing a public good or its change in price quantity etc entirely from public budgets i e by means of a tax reallocation between q and z and or amongst the different policies in q differences in the marginal utility of the private x and public z numeraire goods i e the shadow prices of private and public spending thus potentially introduce differences between ctr and cs flexible pve experiments however allow to derive both ctr and cs welfare measures from the same experiment that is we learn the extent to which individuals are willing to trade off the allocation of public budget across public goods and the extent to which they are willing to trade off their private consumption i e their disposable income against public spending the flexible conversion of either form of budget through the tax system ensures that the two welfare measures are equivalent whilst accounting for potential differences between the marginal utilities of private and public numeraire goods 3 3 separate ctr and cs measures can be derived by limiting the use of either budget source for sole use in the public or private domain again the differences in the marginal utilities of z and x determine the relative sizes the benefit of the flexible budget pve format is thus that public expenditure on public goods can directly be related to the traditional hicksian welfare measures through its connection with private income working in the context of the relevant public decision problem potentially enables to overcome some of the shortcomings of other valuation approaches as argued in section 3 in practice deriving the referred welfare measure in fixed and flexible budget pve experiments requires the evaluation of a large number of corner solutions the reason is that individuals choose bundles of discrete projects and also make continuous choices on the numeraire goods 16 dekker et al 14 show that the pve framework allows the use of social welfare functions to provide policy makers with direct advice on the optimal policy portfolio in the application of interest the latter approach is applied in the pve case study in section 4 and we leave an empirical comparison of pve based wtp measures against more conventional cs based wtp measures to future studies as the presented application does not allow for such a comparisons 3 comparing participatory value evaluation with other valuation methods in this section we compare pve with other valuation methods in this discussion we focus on the quantification of consumer surplus measures and primarily willingness to pay wtp which is considered to form the theoretical underpinning of most cba studies 17 a cba expresses the social costs and benefits of government projects in monetary terms there are many ways in which costs and benefits can be expressed in monetary terms including the use of market prices analysts usually derive wtp estimates directly from market behaviour e g market prices impacts of government projects are amongst other things often evaluated through investigating the private decisions people make when buying a house 18 or recreation decisions e g 19 20 a shortcoming of studying behaviour in real world markets is that the derived welfare measures including market prices can be incomplete due to only accounting for user benefits instead of the total economic value tev 17 similarly suitable surrogate markets may be absent this is particularly relevant in the context of studying the impact of public policies it is in this context that hypothetical choices studied through stated preference sp surveys become useful e g 21 22 pve can be operationalised using sp surveys 3 1 private willingness to pay as the primary measure of value in cba in the private wtp approach including the study of real world markets changes in personal income are explicitly linked to changes in individuals consumption of private and or public goods e g quality improvements a critique on the private wtp approach is that individuals consumption choices may not reflect how they want public policies to change 8 10 23 25 for instance people may not be willing to contribute individually to the public good because in their view the impact of their individual contribution is negligible people may however be willing to contribute when the whole community contributes because the impacts of coordinated efforts can be substantial 10 24 26 27 scholars also argue that individuals private consumer choices might not reflect their preferences towards public policy because moral considerations might be more salient in the latter context 9 9 p 48 asserts that many of us are concerned for example that the workplace be safe and free of carcinogens we may share this conviction even if we are not workers and so we might favour laws that require very high air quality standards in petrochemical plants but as consumers we may find no way to support the cause of workplace safety indeed if we buy the cheapest products we may defeat it we may be concerned as citizens or as members of a moral and political community with all sorts of values sentimental historical ideological cultural aesthetic and ethical that conflict with the interests we reveal as consumers buying shoes and choosing tomatoes the conflict within individuals rather than between them may be a very common conflict 3 2 public willingness to pay to ameliorate this issue impacts of government projects have been evaluated through public wtp experiments these experiments express the impacts of government projects for the entire community and are financed by a uniform tax increase or alternative but comparable payment vehicle 28 31 in such experiments respondents are told how much each would have to pay if the measure passed and are then asked to cast a simple yes or no vote since everyone is asked to contribute the coordination problem associated with private wtp studies is resolved public wtp still makes the connection between policy impacts and private income but formulate the decision problem in the context of the actual public decision in which an individual has to decide whether the overall positive and negative impacts of a government project warrant a often uniform tax increase hence individuals express their preferences toward a collective choice of the government that potentially affects their private income and that of others the distinction between private wtp experiments and public wtp experiments differs from the distinction that is made in the literature between the elicitation of people s personal interests consumer preferences and the elicitation of people s perceptions of the common good citizen preferences 9 31 32 both private wtp experiments and public wtp experiments enable respondents to express personal interests and paternalistic altruistic considerations the main difference is that public wtp experiments allow respondents to express these considerations in the context of a government decision where a trade off needs to be made between social impacts of a project and a tax in private wtp experiments and public wtp experiments participants make their choices individually which differs from the study of alvarez farizo et al 32 in which participants collectively expressed their preferences for water quality improvements in a group setting 3 3 willingness to allocate public budget the shift from private wtp to public wtp does not solve all criticisms regarding wtp based valuation a remaining critique concerns the implicit assumption within private and public wtp based valuation that private euros and public euros cannot have a different purpose 12 33 34 thaler 34 for example shows that euros contained within a given budget can indeed have a specific goal or purpose from this point of view individuals might view their private income and government funds as constituting two separate budgets or use different utility functions depending on the funding source when it makes a difference how public projects are paid for it is compelling to infer the welfare effects of government projects that are financed from public revenues through investigating individuals preferences regarding the expenditure of public euros in so called willingness to allocate public budget experiments wtapb participants make choices over alternative allocations of government budget across different government projects 11 12 35 37 for instance in the experiment of 11 respondents were asked to choose between two safety enhancing road investment projects that target different age groups and road user types both options required the same level of public investment wtapb experiments therefore do not directly impact the respondent s disposable income and the provision of other public goods other than those considered in the choice experiment 4 4 there is a subtle difference between wtapb experiments in which the provision of other public goods than those respondents could choose in the choice experiment is not affected and willingness to re allocate tax experiments in which the financing of the public good under scrutiny is to be paid for by a decrease in the amount of a household s taxation money that was previously spent on public goods that are not considered in the choice experiment 38 40 it is in this context that bergstrom et al 13 developed the ctr welfare measure as discussed in section 2 1 one clear downside of the wtapb approach is that respondents are forced to make a choice between two or three alternative allocations of public budgets 11 35 when respondents believe that it is better to do nothing instead of allocating public budget to the proposed projects they do not have the opportunity to express this preference 41 argue that any wtp estimate based on an experimental design in which the baseline is not present will yield inaccurate estimates of consumer welfare such biases will particularly arise when for some respondents the most preferred option is the current baseline i e do nothing situation the fact that respondents can express this preference in a fixed budget pve is an important feature compared to existing wtapb experiments 3 4 extending the fixed budget pve to a flexible budget pve the limitation of wtapb and fixed budget pve experiments is that no connection exists between the spending of public money and the private budget see section 2 1 as a result only the ctr welfare measure can be derived this limits the interpretation of the ctr measure relative to the standard cs measure unless a survey is run with two alternative payment vehicles 13 the tax system can be used to connect the two welfare measures as proposed by our flexible budget pve design in section 2 the conceptual innovation of the introduction of flexible budget pves is that the public wtp valuation paradigm and the wtapb valuation paradigm are integrated in one valuation framework that is the desirability of government projects are established through the elicitation of individuals preferences over the allocation of public budgets including the trade off between the public budget and their private income as shown in section 2 the ctr and cs measures are equivalent whilst recognising the two separate sources of budget and associated opportunity costs central to the wtapb argument 4 a pve for a flood protection scheme of the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management in this section we present a pve case study to provide a tangible example of the method and its policy evaluation features the case study concerns the first application of pve and was developed to empirically test the conceptual idea of pve the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management was willing to facilitate and finance a case study regarding flood protection schemes in the netherlands the flood protection schemes focused on a trade off between two types of solutions to mitigate flood risks at locations along the dutch river de waal which do not meet the prescribed safety standards the first type of project solution is simply strengthening the dikes henceforth classical project the second type of project involves strengthening the dikes to some extent combined with measures to give the river space to flood safely henceforth combination project the two types of projects have an equal impact on mitigating flood risks but differ on costs and social impacts e g impact on biodiversity impact on recreation and number of households that need to relocate combination projects increase recreation opportunities and biodiversity but are more expensive a demo version of this pve can be found online via www populytics nl www participatie begroting nl http burgerbegroting tbm tudelft nl pve flood protection 4 1 experimental set up the main tasks of participants in the pve concerns recommending the dutch government on the budget allocation of 700 million euros on four locations alongside the river de waal citizens must choose between a classical project and a combination project fig 1 depicts these four locations respondents receive information about the costs and impacts of choosing for a classical project or a combination project at each location e g impact on recreation impact on biodiversity and number of households that experience nuisance due to the project as they potentially need to relocate the governmental budget can also be spend on six other projects that fall within the remit of the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management two road projects two projects mitigating damage from heavy rainfall and two projects reducing flood risks beyond current safety standards respondents receive similar information regarding the impacts of these projects e g travel time savings and reduction in the number of severe traffic accidents in essence respondents need to decide about the extent to which they want to sacrifice these other projects in order to enable the selection of the more expensive combination project on the locations alongside de waal the four locations alongside the river de waal were selected in close collaboration with policy makers from the ministry who were preparing these decisions we selected locations for which a strategic choice between a classical project and a combination project needed to be made in the short run after this strategic choice various more detailed decisions needed to be made the six other projects were selected together with policy makers from other departments within the ministry who were asked to suggest projects that were also up for a decision to disentangle the impact of the policy features i e policy attributes from the overall policy we asked policy makers of the ministry to provide bandwidths within which the policy features could vary as with the design of standard choice experiments we used these bandwidths to generate an experimental design see the supplementary material for more information the features of the policies thus vary slightly across respondents in contrast with most choice experiments respondents only define a single optimal portfolio choice task in the pve table 1 describes the bandwidths for the features associated with each project the most important differences between the four locations in terms of the impact of choosing for either the classical project or the combination project were 1 the difference in costs between the two options was much lower at the location gendtse waard relative to the other locations but at the other three locations choosing for the combination project had a stronger positive impact on biodiversity 2 only at the location oosterhout a number of households would experience nuisance from the choice for the combination project two pve experiments were conducted a fixed budget pve and a flexible budget pve in the fixed budget pve respondents were asked to recommend a portfolio of projects given a governmental budget constraint of 700 million euros respondents were obliged to choose a classical project or a combination project at each of the four locations the other six projects were optional any remaining budget was shifted forward to the next year in the flexible budget pve respondents could adjust the governmental budget by increasing the tax per household or by selecting a rebate a tax increase decrease of 8 million euro of the budget in the pve resulted in an increase decrease of taxes of 1 euro per dutch household in 2019 as such individuals participating in the flexible budget pve can influence their after tax income participants of the fixed budget pve do not have this opportunity both the fixed and the flexible pve were conducted in a web based environment first respondents received information about the goals of the experiment to ensure that respondents feel that their responses might influence decisions we communicated to the respondents that the research project was commissioned by the ministry of infrastructure and water management in order to seek advice from a large group of citizens with regard to a policy dilemma 42 next they were asked to give informed consent 5 5 respondents who gave informed consent for participating in the experiment received the following instruction the ministry of infrastructure and water management decided to consult a large number of citizens to provide an advice for this choice situation you are one of the citizens that we selected we ask you to choose between a classical project and a combination project at four locations you can allocate a budget of 700 million euros you are obliged to choose on the four locations alongside the river de waal between a classical project and a combination project in case there is governmental budget left you can spend it on six other projects that fall within the responsibility of the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management two road projects two projects mitigating damage from heavy rainfall and two projects reducing flood risks beyond the new safety standards more specifically we ask you to select the projects you advise to the government through clicking on the selection button please note that any remaining budget will be shifted forward to the next year this implies that the ministry of transport and water management will be able to spend more money on projects that fall within their responsibility in the next year in the instruction video we further explain how you can sort the projects compare the projects by one of the impacts and find out more about the impacts of projects through clicking on an information button fig 2 presents a screenshot of the page where respondents could select projects fig 3 presents a screenshot of a page where respondents could find more information about a project respondents in the experiment could make the choice to delegate their decision to an expert two civil servants and one academic this delegation option recognises that some of the respondents might find the experiment to complicated or burdensome or find it more rational to put their trust in the expertise of experts in the context of this decision problem these experts also made their choices in the experiment when participants delegated their choice was replaced by the choice of the selected delegate in the empirical analysis it is possible to redo this analysis without these delegated choices in order to see whether the results differ furthermore the option is useful as it might reduce protest responses in the survey after respondents selected their preferred portfolio they were asked to motivate their choices for each project they selected these motivations provide valuable insights into the qualitative reasons why some of the projects were chosen at the end of the survey respondents were asked to evaluate several aspects of the pve the survey company kantar public was asked to provide two random samples of dutch citizens of 18 years and older and we used a between subjects design for our study 2900 respondents participated in the experiments out of which 937 respondents were specifically recruited in the areas adjacent to the river de waal all respondents who finished the experiment received a financial compensation from the survey company in case respondents delegated their choice they received a lower financial compensation around 1 euro the use of different incentives for providing an advice or delegating might muddle the preference elicitation process at the margin if getting extra euros from the survey company is more important for respondents than making the right choice then they might go ahead and click through just to get the extra euro even if absent the monetary incentive they think it is better if an expert makes the call notwithstanding this drawback we decided to provide respondents who delegated with a lower financial compensation because we were concerned that many respondents would choose for delegation when we would give them the same financial compensation the underlying reason for this decision is that this was the first time that we applied the pve method and we wanted to learn as much as possible from the responses of the participants overall we found ample room for improvements while conducting this pve study we recommended the policy makers who commissioned the study to keep this in mind when interpreting the results of the study the next subsection discusses the results from the case study 4 2 results in the fixed budget pve 266 out of 1855 respondents delegated their choice to an expert 14 and in the flexible budget pve 223 out of 1045 respondents delegated 21 the fact that more individuals delegated in the flexible budget pve may be the result of the increased complexity of the choice task in this experimental setting on the other hand it is surprising that a relatively large number of respondents delegated a choice to an expert that might affect their private income in the fixed budget pve 2 1 of the respondents fully exhausted the budget which is partly a result of the limited number of project portfolios available that would exhaust the public budget in the flexible budget pve the percentage of the respondents who fully exhausted the budget was a bit higher 6 8 fig 4 provides more detailed information with regard to the size of the budget that was shifted forward in the two experimental settings 620 respondents participating in the flexible budget pve did not change the budget 122 respondents decreased the budget and 82 respondents increased the budget see fig 5 for more detailed information on the extent to which respondents changed the budget we did not find a significant correlation between the income of the respondent and their decision to change the budget however the single respondent who selected the null portfolio choosing for the classical project at each location and a maximal reduction in budget was an individual with a very low income after participants of the flexible budget pve completed the experiment we asked them why they decided not to change the budget most respondents who increased the budget stressed the importance of biodiversity and said that the relatively low tax increase that was needed to improve biodiversity urged them to increase the budget many respondents who decreased the budget referred to low importance of the projects among which they could choose moreover a group of participants argued that they reduced the budget because they had a negative stance towards government spending in general for instance one respondent argued i think that taxes should be as low as possible only the most essential tasks should be conducted and financed by the government many of the respondents who did not change the budget argued that the government would have a good reason for setting the budget at this level and they found it risky to overrule such a decision another group of respondents stated that they did not decrease the budget because they thought that it would be good if the government had some financial reserves in case of a setback for instance one respondent argued i didn t decrease the budget because such projects always face cost overruns various respondents argued that they did not increase the budget because they thought that the government should respect its budget fig 6 presents the market shares of the different projects for the respondents who did not delegate their decision to an expert to check for spatial differentiation in project choices both the market shares for the full sample the netherlands and for the respondents recruited in the waal area are reported for each project the average costs presented to the sample are also displayed in all four locations the majority of respondents selected the combination project in the fixed budget pve and the flexible budget pve respectively 39 1 and 40 9 of the respondents selected the combination project at all four locations the classical project was selected at all four locations by 7 0 of the respondents fixed budget pve and 7 6 of the respondents flexible budget pve strikingly the results did not differ very much between the respondents living close to the river waal and random sample of dutch citizens a proportions test revealed that at the 5 significance level only for the road project joure a6 a7 motorway and the project mitigating heavy rainfall at hooge boezem were selected more often by respondents from the random sample of the dutch population than respondents living in the waal area overall the results of the fixed and flexible budget pve are quite similar a proportions test across the fixed and flexible budget pve reveals that only for the road expansion a2 motorway we observe a significant difference in proportions between the fixed and flexible pve samples at the 5 significance level although the comparisons between the two samples is not entirely fair e g in the flexible budget pve respondents were allowed to change the budget and respondents in the fixed budget pve did not have this option we take this as evidence that the two samples are largely comparable the chosen policy portfolios are quantitatively analysed using advanced discrete continuous choice models more details on the modelling can be found in the supplementary material we estimate taste parameters in order to derive the relevance of social impacts associated with the projects comparable to attributes in stated preference surveys this analysis revealed that participants particularly preferred the combination projects over the classical projects when the former projects would positively influence biodiversity and recreational opportunities see the supplementary material for more detailed information respondents answers to the question why they selected the combination projects also show that improved recreational opportunities and variety in biodiversity are the main reasons for choosing these projects however we also inferred from these qualitative motivations that participants mentioned reasons that were not linked to the impacts for which they received explicit information in the pve for instance respondents argued that they selected combination projects because they believe that this solution to mitigate flood risk is aesthetically superior and is more future proof moreover various respondents stated that they selected the road project joure a6 a7 motorway which is located in the north of the netherlands for reasons of spatial fairness these respondents believe that issues in the urban areas in the western part of the country receive too much attention compared to issues in the periphery see for instance the following statement of a respondent the north and the south of the netherlands are always forgotten by the west politicians have no problem with spending millions of euros on congestion issues in the western part of the country but they should also have an eye for issues in other parts of the country hence we estimate so called project specific parameters for each project which captures the utility individuals derive from a project irrespective of the level of the impacts included explicitly in the pve comparable to alternative specific constants in stated preference surveys the obtained results can be used to inform policy makers about the desirability of the various policies and projects see the supplementary material for the technical details and 14 for the generic microeconomic framework of participatory value evaluation a first useful output of the analysis is the probability that an individual project improves social welfare compared to shifting the required budget to the next period in other words it reveals the probability that the project provides value for money fig 7 shows that all the combination projects provide value for money for instance choosing the combination project at gendtse waard has an 86 probability to improve social welfare compared to choosing for the classical project at this location and shifting the difference in costs in this case 5 million euro to the next year 6 6 if all the participants in the pve would have selected the null portfolio they would have recommended to implement the classical project at each of the four locations and shift the remaining public budget to the next year in that case the probability that one of the combination projects improves social welfare would have approached 0 the project desirability of the road expansion of the a2 motorway is only 31 its low probability to provide value for money over shifting the required public budget to the next year implies the project should not be implemented irrespective of the available budget a second useful output of the analysis is the ranking of portfolios of projects in terms of expected social welfare when the public budget is unlimited policy makers could opt for all projects with a desirability probability of higher than 50 the combination projects at all four locations and the projects moerwijk venlo hooge boezem driemanspolder and joure however in reality policy makers are faced with limited budgets and pve also allows for the identification of the optimal selection of projects i e the optimal portfolio for a given budget fig 8 shows the top 10 of portfolios within a budget constraint of 688 million euros we used the average budget recommended in the flexible budget pve 688 million euros as the budget constraint this implies a tax decrease of 1 5 euro per household in 2019 based on these results we can draw three main conclusions 1 the large road project road expansion a2 motorway is not included in all the top 10 portfolio s 2 at the locations sleeuwijk and werkendam the combination project is included in all the top 10 portfolio s 3 the optimal portfolio opts for the combination project in all four locations in order to see whether these conclusions are robust to changes in assumptions concerning the level of the social impacts included in the experiment e g costs and impact on biodiversity we performed various sensitivity analyses see the supplementary material these sensitivity analyses reveal that the first two conclusions are highly robust to changes in assumptions however when we assume a very low impact of the combination projects on biodiversity and recreational opportunities the combination project is not included in the optimal portfolio at the location oosterhout 4 3 experiences of participants and policy makers policy makers who commissioned the pve case study presented the results of the study both within and outside the ministry in the presentations they stated that a useful insight for them was that both the quantitative and qualitative information from the pve indicate that citizens particularly prefer the combination projects over the classical projects when the former projects positively influence biodiversity and recreational opportunities moreover policy makers found it interesting to learn which type of projects citizens are willing to sacrifice to enable them to choose the more expensive combination project instead of the cheaper classical project for instance citizens are willing to sacrifice the large road project road expansion a2 motorway to make way for more expensive combination projects which foster biodiversity and recreation policy makers also argued that a strength of pve concerns the facilitation of mass participation of citizens in the evaluation of public policies a key benefit of pve compared to existing approaches for citizen participation e g public hearings and citizen juries is that the entry barriers for participating are relatively low participants generally spend 20 30 min before submitting their choice s and the respondents can choose themselves when and where they conduct the pve as a result of the low entry barriers not only the passionate proponents and opponents but also the so called silent majority can participate in the evaluation of public policies the socio demographics of the respondents see the supplementary materials reveal that all relevant segments of the population are represented in the final part of the pve experiment participants were asked about the extent to which they agreed with four propositions all four propositions were evaluated in a positive way 1 i was convinced of my choices 24 strongly agree 55 agree 18 neutral 2 disagree 1 strongly disagree i thought that the experiment was realistic 16 strongly agree 45 agree 27 neutral 10 disagree 2 strongly disagree 3 i think it is good that the government aims to involve citizens in making choices between projects in the experiment 41 strongly agree 42 agree 12 neutral 5 disagree 1 strongly disagree 4 this experiment provides the government with relevant information for making choices between projects 19 strongly agree 46 agree 26 neutral 7 disagree 1 strongly disagree the fact that more than 80 of the participants in the case study agreed that it is good that the ministry of transport and water management involved citizens in the evaluation of policy options indicates that there is a clear demand for public participation among dutch citizens possibly pve can be a response to this demand besides responding to the four statements mentioned above participants in the pve were asked to provide qualitative feedback with regard to the pve experiment in which they participated various citizens argued that they thought that participating in a pve is a nice way to get involved into policymaking and to ensure that their voices are heard they liked the fact that they are invited to make a strategic choice that is close to the dilemma policy makers face moreover citizens who participated in the pves argued that it raised their awareness concerning the dilemmas policy makers are faced with in making complex decisions because they have to make consequential choices themselves for instance citizens learned about scarcity of public resources not everything is possible and the cons and pros of the alternative policy options apart from the respondents who were positive about pve we saw that 1 of the respondents strongly disagreed with the statement this experiment provides the government with relevant information for making choices between projects when analysing the experiences of these respondents we saw that some of them thought that the experiment was too simplistic to provide policy makers with solid information to underpin political decisions whereas other respondents struggled with the complexity of the experiment apart from the respondents that questioned their own ability to complete the experiments another group of respondents questioned the extent to which respondents with low levels of education were able to complete the choice tasks some negative respondents thought that complex decisions regarding flood protection should be left to experts instead of the general public finally various respondents criticised the lack of transparency with regard to the selection of the projects that were part of the experiment and some even stated that they wanted to be involved in this selection process 5 discussion this paper started out by extending the welfare framework for the evaluation of public expenditure as presented by bergstrom et al 13 with the purpose of aligning the participatory value evaluation pve survey method with the kaldor hicks efficiency criteria underlying the cost benefit analysis cba framework the fixed budget pve survey format which concerns the optimal allocation of public budget allows deriving the compensating tax reallocation ctr measures as obtained from bergstrom et al 13 s willingeness to allocate public budget wtapb experiments the fixed budget pve survey format makes the shadow price of public budget directly insightful to respondents improving the validity of the ctr welfare measure relative to wtapb a further contribution is made through the flexible budget pve survey format which allows connecting and under the assumption of perfect fungibility of the private and public budget equating the ctr welfare measure to the traditional consumer surplus cs measure this is achieved by allowing respondents to adjust the size of public budget through the tax system and thereby connecting the private and public budget several arguments have been provided in section 3 as to why fixed and flexible pve surveys are considered relevant alternatives to traditional private willingness to pay wtp studies these include the need to elicit preferences for public policies and corresponding trade offs in the context of the actual policy context as opposed to the use of private markets the opportunity to solve coordination problems alike public wtp studies and that public policies are typically financed from public budgets as opposed to private budgets alike wtapb bergstrom et al 13 do recognise that such context specific welfare measures pose challenges for the transfer of such values to other policy contexts and these reflections translate to the pve framework on the other hand it can be argued that decisions on the allocation of vast amounts of public budget 700 million euro in the context of this case study warrant a context specific welfare analysis to illustrate the pve framework we presented a case study regarding projects mitigating flood risks in the netherlands the main result of this pve case study is that citizens prefer projects that combine strengthening dikes and give space to the river to flood safely particularly when such projects positively influence biodiversity and recreational opportunities this application was positively evaluated by policy makers who commissioned the case study and by citizens who participated in this case study however we also found that there is ample room for further improvement of which some directions are given below a key limitation of our study is that it was not possible to investigate how the welfare measures from pve studies compare to those from private wtp studies this requires specifically designed experimental setups which were not possible to conduct with the pve case study presented here a second limitation is that pve experiments are complex when compared to conventional private wtp studies we dealt with this issue through offering respondents who find the experiment to complicated or burdensome the option to delegate their choice to an expert moreover it is quite comforting that 89 of the respondents agreed with the statement i was convinced of my choices which indicates that most of the respondents understood the experiment even though the choice tasks in a pve are relatively complex of course the concern remains that participants structurally overestimate their own competence to make a rational choice we recommend further research which investigates whether participants applied simplified heuristics like the attribute non attendance in ce due to the complexity of the choice task and what the effects would be from potential cognitive overload and if there are certain groups of respondents that have a third limitation is that we saw that some respondents criticised pve because they thought that complex government decisions should be left to experts we think it is interesting to give participants in further research projects the option to communicate their opinion regarding the extent to which outcomes of the experiment and expert advice should influence decision making perhaps these critical respondents are more satisfied when they are explicitly asked in a pve to answer this question moreover we think that it is interesting to investigate the merits of new delegation options e g providing participants who delegate with the same financial compensation and also provide participants with the option to delegate to politicians and to analyse whether respondents who adopt different choice strategies make different choices through tracking the behaviour of participants during the experiment how many respondents watch the whole instruction video and how many respondents used the attribute sorting function we wish to emphasize that the purpose of this study is not to claim that pve is superior or inferior to other valuation approaches arguably the appropriateness of using pve or other valuation methods depends on the policy related economic question moreover the normative question about whether pve is not a more appropriate method for the valuation of public goods compared to other approaches also requires more consideration a practical approach to further investigate this question is to evaluate the welfare effects of a set of government projects through both a pve and alternative valuation techniques such as private wtp and evaluate the performance of these two studies on various criteria such as hypothetical bias protest votes confidence of respondents in their choices and the extent to which respondents believe that the study provides the government with relevant information for making choices between projects author contributions niek mouter development of the participatory value evaluation literature review analysis of qualitative

method which elicits citizens preferences over the allocation of public budgets as well as their private income in a pve citizens are asked to choose the best portfolio of projects given a governmental and a private budget constraint first this paper aligns pve with the traditional kaldor hicks welfare economics framework underlying many cost benefit analyses second this paper positions pve against other valuation methods third this paper applies the pve method to evaluate the impacts of projects mitigating flood risks in the netherlands this empirical application reveals that dutch citizens indicate a preference for projects that combine strengthening dikes and give space to the river to flood safely particularly when such projects positively influence biodiversity and recreational opportunities keywords participatory value evaluation cost benefit analysis valuation methods flood protection biodiversity environmental valuation 1 introduction in virtually all western countries cost benefit analysis cba is nowadays considered the gold standard for supporting public decision making 1 in various countries such as the united kingdom the netherlands and sweden cba is mandatory when national funding is required for large transport projects 2 cba is also widely applied to governmental decisions on environmental policies safety regulation and water management 3 5 for instance cba has been used to inform policies regarding flood protection marine protection water quality management biodiversity and environmental conservation in the united kingdom 5 the theoretical foundations of cba are rooted in welfare economics which is a branch of economics that investigates the social desirability of alternative economic outcomes 6 a cba is built on the kaldor hicks efficiency criterion 7 which recommends projects where the sum of monetary gains outweigh the sum of monetary losses such that winners can potentially compensate the losers and still be better off the conversion of positive and negative social impacts of government projects into monetary units relies on willingness to pay wtp and willingness to accept wta estimates several scholars criticize the wtp wta valuation methods by arguing that they take a too narrow perspective when evaluating government projects because choices individuals make with their private income might not accurately reflect their preferences towards public policy 8 10 to resolve this issue scholars developed so called willingness to allocate public budget experiments wtapb in which individuals make choices when faced with effects accruing from alternative allocations of government budget 11 13 the wtapb approach aims to infer welfare effects of government projects from individuals preferences regarding the expenditure of public euros participatory value evaluation pve is a survey method which interconnects the wtp wta and the wtapb valuation paradigm the similarity between wtapb experiments and pve experiments is that participants are asked to express which public projects should be financed from a limited amount of public budget the most important difference between these two approaches is that participants in a pve have the option to advise the government against allocating the budget to any or some of the projects that are considered in the pve and shift the remaining budget to the next year or to other government departments in addition to this fixed budget pve format the flexible budget pve format allows participants to adjust the size of the public budget and thereby their private after tax income by changing taxes the contribution of the flexible budget pve format is that the wtp valuation paradigm and the wtapb valuation paradigm are integrated in a single valuation framework that is the desirability of government projects is established simultaneously through the elicitation of individuals preferences over the allocation of an earmarked public budget as well as their private income dekker et al 14 present the econometric and microeconomic framework which allows for a social welfare analysis of government projects included in fixed and flexible budget pve experiments although the social welfare approach is our preferred way of interpreting the results from a pve study a key connection that needs to be made is the extent to which any derived measure of consumer surplus from a pve study can be aligned with the kaldor hicks efficiency framework to this end and this is the first aim of this paper we develop a stylised model in section 2 extending the work of bergstrom et al 13 section 3 continues with a qualitative discussion positioning pve relative to other valuation methods as a second contribution this paper presents a case study focusing on the policy evaluation features of pve section 4 the case study concerns flood protection schemes of the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management the main aim of the case study is to provide a tangible example of the pve method section 4 also discusses the experiences of participants and policy makers section 5 provides a discussion this paper does not aim to draw the conclusion that pve is a better or worse method compared to other methods we also do not aim to compare policy recommendations produced by a pve and standard cba as this particular question is investigated in mouter et al 15 2 participatory value evaluation and the connection with welfare economics in this subsection we introduce two alternative versions of participatory value evaluation pve and build upon the framework presented by bergstrom et al 13 allowing us to align pve to the kaldor hicks welfare economics framework respondents in a pve are requested to select their optimal bundle of public goods q where spending public budget on the bundle q implies that less budget can be spend on other public goods z the fixed budget pve requires respondents to allocate a fixed public budget across alternative public goods the flexible budget pve provides respondents the additional opportunity to increase or decrease the public budget by recommending the government to levy a collective tax increase reduction we define z as the spending of the remainder of the public budget on future public projects alternative formulations are possible where z is the remainder of the public budget that is available for spending in other departments of the local government since the exact spending of z is not defined it is treated as a numeraire or composite public good which satisfies the public budget constraint in the flexible budget pve setting an additional numeraire or composite private good x is introduced alongside a tax increase or a reduction which results in an increase of the public budget given our focus on evaluating public investments in public goods the exact spending of the private budget is irrelevant and the introduction of a numeraire private good is sufficient the introduction of a public and private numeraire good enables to firmly root pve in the context of welfare economics and related measures of consumer surplus 2 1 behavioral model fixed budget pve following bergstrom et al 13 we define the direct utility function u n for individual n in a fixed budget pve as 1 1 it is assumed that the private budget decisions do not influence the available public budget in the fixed budget pve and therefore x is disregarded in the present subsection 1 u n u n q z the public budget constraint b for the fixed pve experiment is defined by 2 b q p z where q is a vector of binary variables indicating which projects have been included in the policy portfolio and p is the corresponding price vector z is the numeraire public good that completes the public budget constraint assuming the individual is utility maximising we can summarise the fixed pve decision problem as follows 3 max q z u n u n q z subject to b q p z the solution to the above maximisation problem provides a set of conditional marshallian demand functions q p b and z p b which when plugged into the direct utility function provides the conditional indirect or optimal utility function v n 4 v n v n p b the corresponding conditional public expenditure function e can under the assumption that the public budget is exhausted be obtained by inverting the conditional indirect utility function for a given optimal utility level v n 5 e e p v n following the definition of bergstrom et al 13 we can define the impact of a price or quality change of the public goods in q as a compensating tax reallocation ctr 6 c t r e p 0 v n 0 e p 1 v n 0 in terms of the hicksian measures of welfare change the ctr measure is comparable with the compensating surplus given that we are contrasting against the original level of utility v n 0 and are generally considered with quality changes rather than price changes relative to bergstrom et al 2004 the fixed budget pve explicitly incorporates the notion of the numeraire public good into the data elicitation process the benefits of doing so are discussed in more detail in section 3 3 2 2 behavioral model flexible budget pve in flexible budget pve experiments the respondent can adjust the size of the public budget through the tax system and hence private consumption x n and the private budget constraint become relevant we can reformulate the utility maximisation problem to 7 max q x n z τ n u n u n q x n z subject to b n τ n q p z m n x n τ n where x n is demand for the composite private good with unit price τ n is a tax or tax rebate which can be imposed to increase decrease the public budget and m n is income for individual n for simplicity the design of the tax system is assumed to be exogenous the two budget constraints can be combined to reflect the total public and private budget e t available in the economy 8 e t b n m n q p z n x n solving the utility maximisation problem provides the marshallian demand functions q p b m z p b m and x n p b m where m is the vector of disposable income for all individuals in the population these demand functions can again be used to arrive at the conditional indirect or optimal utility function 9 v n v n p b m in the absence of non paternalistic altruistic preferences it can be assumed that v n m j 0 j n the private budget available to other individuals in the population for consumption does not influence the value obtained by individual n from consuming the public goods q and z and neither do changes in the income of individual j allow individual n to consume more of good x n and thereby derive a higher level of utility given these assumptions the indirect utility function then only depends on the income level of individual n and reduces to 10 v n v n p b m n the corresponding expenditure function for individual n representing the total budget clearly shows this separation and can be defined as 2 2 note that e n does consider the individuals optimal decision from the collective tax which increases the public budget 11 e n j n m j e n p v n the total budget expenditure formulation above highlights that private and public money are completely fungible i e a euro is a euro the tax system allows converting private budget into public budget and vice versa the flexible budget pve format thus allows to adjust changes in the public budget b and the private budget m n to reach a given level of utility under the assumption that there are no deadweight losses associated with the collection of public funds via taxation this respectively corresponds to the referred ctr welfare measure and the traditional consumer surplus cs measure the fungibility of money in the flexible budget pve framework ensures ctr is equivalent to cs bergstrom et al 13 relates the traditional cs measure to the case of financing a public good or its change in price quantity etc entirely from private budgets i e by means of a special tax the ctr welfare measure relates to financing a public good or its change in price quantity etc entirely from public budgets i e by means of a tax reallocation between q and z and or amongst the different policies in q differences in the marginal utility of the private x and public z numeraire goods i e the shadow prices of private and public spending thus potentially introduce differences between ctr and cs flexible pve experiments however allow to derive both ctr and cs welfare measures from the same experiment that is we learn the extent to which individuals are willing to trade off the allocation of public budget across public goods and the extent to which they are willing to trade off their private consumption i e their disposable income against public spending the flexible conversion of either form of budget through the tax system ensures that the two welfare measures are equivalent whilst accounting for potential differences between the marginal utilities of private and public numeraire goods 3 3 separate ctr and cs measures can be derived by limiting the use of either budget source for sole use in the public or private domain again the differences in the marginal utilities of z and x determine the relative sizes the benefit of the flexible budget pve format is thus that public expenditure on public goods can directly be related to the traditional hicksian welfare measures through its connection with private income working in the context of the relevant public decision problem potentially enables to overcome some of the shortcomings of other valuation approaches as argued in section 3 in practice deriving the referred welfare measure in fixed and flexible budget pve experiments requires the evaluation of a large number of corner solutions the reason is that individuals choose bundles of discrete projects and also make continuous choices on the numeraire goods 16 dekker et al 14 show that the pve framework allows the use of social welfare functions to provide policy makers with direct advice on the optimal policy portfolio in the application of interest the latter approach is applied in the pve case study in section 4 and we leave an empirical comparison of pve based wtp measures against more conventional cs based wtp measures to future studies as the presented application does not allow for such a comparisons 3 comparing participatory value evaluation with other valuation methods in this section we compare pve with other valuation methods in this discussion we focus on the quantification of consumer surplus measures and primarily willingness to pay wtp which is considered to form the theoretical underpinning of most cba studies 17 a cba expresses the social costs and benefits of government projects in monetary terms there are many ways in which costs and benefits can be expressed in monetary terms including the use of market prices analysts usually derive wtp estimates directly from market behaviour e g market prices impacts of government projects are amongst other things often evaluated through investigating the private decisions people make when buying a house 18 or recreation decisions e g 19 20 a shortcoming of studying behaviour in real world markets is that the derived welfare measures including market prices can be incomplete due to only accounting for user benefits instead of the total economic value tev 17 similarly suitable surrogate markets may be absent this is particularly relevant in the context of studying the impact of public policies it is in this context that hypothetical choices studied through stated preference sp surveys become useful e g 21 22 pve can be operationalised using sp surveys 3 1 private willingness to pay as the primary measure of value in cba in the private wtp approach including the study of real world markets changes in personal income are explicitly linked to changes in individuals consumption of private and or public goods e g quality improvements a critique on the private wtp approach is that individuals consumption choices may not reflect how they want public policies to change 8 10 23 25 for instance people may not be willing to contribute individually to the public good because in their view the impact of their individual contribution is negligible people may however be willing to contribute when the whole community contributes because the impacts of coordinated efforts can be substantial 10 24 26 27 scholars also argue that individuals private consumer choices might not reflect their preferences towards public policy because moral considerations might be more salient in the latter context 9 9 p 48 asserts that many of us are concerned for example that the workplace be safe and free of carcinogens we may share this conviction even if we are not workers and so we might favour laws that require very high air quality standards in petrochemical plants but as consumers we may find no way to support the cause of workplace safety indeed if we buy the cheapest products we may defeat it we may be concerned as citizens or as members of a moral and political community with all sorts of values sentimental historical ideological cultural aesthetic and ethical that conflict with the interests we reveal as consumers buying shoes and choosing tomatoes the conflict within individuals rather than between them may be a very common conflict 3 2 public willingness to pay to ameliorate this issue impacts of government projects have been evaluated through public wtp experiments these experiments express the impacts of government projects for the entire community and are financed by a uniform tax increase or alternative but comparable payment vehicle 28 31 in such experiments respondents are told how much each would have to pay if the measure passed and are then asked to cast a simple yes or no vote since everyone is asked to contribute the coordination problem associated with private wtp studies is resolved public wtp still makes the connection between policy impacts and private income but formulate the decision problem in the context of the actual public decision in which an individual has to decide whether the overall positive and negative impacts of a government project warrant a often uniform tax increase hence individuals express their preferences toward a collective choice of the government that potentially affects their private income and that of others the distinction between private wtp experiments and public wtp experiments differs from the distinction that is made in the literature between the elicitation of people s personal interests consumer preferences and the elicitation of people s perceptions of the common good citizen preferences 9 31 32 both private wtp experiments and public wtp experiments enable respondents to express personal interests and paternalistic altruistic considerations the main difference is that public wtp experiments allow respondents to express these considerations in the context of a government decision where a trade off needs to be made between social impacts of a project and a tax in private wtp experiments and public wtp experiments participants make their choices individually which differs from the study of alvarez farizo et al 32 in which participants collectively expressed their preferences for water quality improvements in a group setting 3 3 willingness to allocate public budget the shift from private wtp to public wtp does not solve all criticisms regarding wtp based valuation a remaining critique concerns the implicit assumption within private and public wtp based valuation that private euros and public euros cannot have a different purpose 12 33 34 thaler 34 for example shows that euros contained within a given budget can indeed have a specific goal or purpose from this point of view individuals might view their private income and government funds as constituting two separate budgets or use different utility functions depending on the funding source when it makes a difference how public projects are paid for it is compelling to infer the welfare effects of government projects that are financed from public revenues through investigating individuals preferences regarding the expenditure of public euros in so called willingness to allocate public budget experiments wtapb participants make choices over alternative allocations of government budget across different government projects 11 12 35 37 for instance in the experiment of 11 respondents were asked to choose between two safety enhancing road investment projects that target different age groups and road user types both options required the same level of public investment wtapb experiments therefore do not directly impact the respondent s disposable income and the provision of other public goods other than those considered in the choice experiment 4 4 there is a subtle difference between wtapb experiments in which the provision of other public goods than those respondents could choose in the choice experiment is not affected and willingness to re allocate tax experiments in which the financing of the public good under scrutiny is to be paid for by a decrease in the amount of a household s taxation money that was previously spent on public goods that are not considered in the choice experiment 38 40 it is in this context that bergstrom et al 13 developed the ctr welfare measure as discussed in section 2 1 one clear downside of the wtapb approach is that respondents are forced to make a choice between two or three alternative allocations of public budgets 11 35 when respondents believe that it is better to do nothing instead of allocating public budget to the proposed projects they do not have the opportunity to express this preference 41 argue that any wtp estimate based on an experimental design in which the baseline is not present will yield inaccurate estimates of consumer welfare such biases will particularly arise when for some respondents the most preferred option is the current baseline i e do nothing situation the fact that respondents can express this preference in a fixed budget pve is an important feature compared to existing wtapb experiments 3 4 extending the fixed budget pve to a flexible budget pve the limitation of wtapb and fixed budget pve experiments is that no connection exists between the spending of public money and the private budget see section 2 1 as a result only the ctr welfare measure can be derived this limits the interpretation of the ctr measure relative to the standard cs measure unless a survey is run with two alternative payment vehicles 13 the tax system can be used to connect the two welfare measures as proposed by our flexible budget pve design in section 2 the conceptual innovation of the introduction of flexible budget pves is that the public wtp valuation paradigm and the wtapb valuation paradigm are integrated in one valuation framework that is the desirability of government projects are established through the elicitation of individuals preferences over the allocation of public budgets including the trade off between the public budget and their private income as shown in section 2 the ctr and cs measures are equivalent whilst recognising the two separate sources of budget and associated opportunity costs central to the wtapb argument 4 a pve for a flood protection scheme of the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management in this section we present a pve case study to provide a tangible example of the method and its policy evaluation features the case study concerns the first application of pve and was developed to empirically test the conceptual idea of pve the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management was willing to facilitate and finance a case study regarding flood protection schemes in the netherlands the flood protection schemes focused on a trade off between two types of solutions to mitigate flood risks at locations along the dutch river de waal which do not meet the prescribed safety standards the first type of project solution is simply strengthening the dikes henceforth classical project the second type of project involves strengthening the dikes to some extent combined with measures to give the river space to flood safely henceforth combination project the two types of projects have an equal impact on mitigating flood risks but differ on costs and social impacts e g impact on biodiversity impact on recreation and number of households that need to relocate combination projects increase recreation opportunities and biodiversity but are more expensive a demo version of this pve can be found online via www populytics nl www participatie begroting nl http burgerbegroting tbm tudelft nl pve flood protection 4 1 experimental set up the main tasks of participants in the pve concerns recommending the dutch government on the budget allocation of 700 million euros on four locations alongside the river de waal citizens must choose between a classical project and a combination project fig 1 depicts these four locations respondents receive information about the costs and impacts of choosing for a classical project or a combination project at each location e g impact on recreation impact on biodiversity and number of households that experience nuisance due to the project as they potentially need to relocate the governmental budget can also be spend on six other projects that fall within the remit of the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management two road projects two projects mitigating damage from heavy rainfall and two projects reducing flood risks beyond current safety standards respondents receive similar information regarding the impacts of these projects e g travel time savings and reduction in the number of severe traffic accidents in essence respondents need to decide about the extent to which they want to sacrifice these other projects in order to enable the selection of the more expensive combination project on the locations alongside de waal the four locations alongside the river de waal were selected in close collaboration with policy makers from the ministry who were preparing these decisions we selected locations for which a strategic choice between a classical project and a combination project needed to be made in the short run after this strategic choice various more detailed decisions needed to be made the six other projects were selected together with policy makers from other departments within the ministry who were asked to suggest projects that were also up for a decision to disentangle the impact of the policy features i e policy attributes from the overall policy we asked policy makers of the ministry to provide bandwidths within which the policy features could vary as with the design of standard choice experiments we used these bandwidths to generate an experimental design see the supplementary material for more information the features of the policies thus vary slightly across respondents in contrast with most choice experiments respondents only define a single optimal portfolio choice task in the pve table 1 describes the bandwidths for the features associated with each project the most important differences between the four locations in terms of the impact of choosing for either the classical project or the combination project were 1 the difference in costs between the two options was much lower at the location gendtse waard relative to the other locations but at the other three locations choosing for the combination project had a stronger positive impact on biodiversity 2 only at the location oosterhout a number of households would experience nuisance from the choice for the combination project two pve experiments were conducted a fixed budget pve and a flexible budget pve in the fixed budget pve respondents were asked to recommend a portfolio of projects given a governmental budget constraint of 700 million euros respondents were obliged to choose a classical project or a combination project at each of the four locations the other six projects were optional any remaining budget was shifted forward to the next year in the flexible budget pve respondents could adjust the governmental budget by increasing the tax per household or by selecting a rebate a tax increase decrease of 8 million euro of the budget in the pve resulted in an increase decrease of taxes of 1 euro per dutch household in 2019 as such individuals participating in the flexible budget pve can influence their after tax income participants of the fixed budget pve do not have this opportunity both the fixed and the flexible pve were conducted in a web based environment first respondents received information about the goals of the experiment to ensure that respondents feel that their responses might influence decisions we communicated to the respondents that the research project was commissioned by the ministry of infrastructure and water management in order to seek advice from a large group of citizens with regard to a policy dilemma 42 next they were asked to give informed consent 5 5 respondents who gave informed consent for participating in the experiment received the following instruction the ministry of infrastructure and water management decided to consult a large number of citizens to provide an advice for this choice situation you are one of the citizens that we selected we ask you to choose between a classical project and a combination project at four locations you can allocate a budget of 700 million euros you are obliged to choose on the four locations alongside the river de waal between a classical project and a combination project in case there is governmental budget left you can spend it on six other projects that fall within the responsibility of the dutch ministry of infrastructure and water management two road projects two projects mitigating damage from heavy rainfall and two projects reducing flood risks beyond the new safety standards more specifically we ask you to select the projects you advise to the government through clicking on the selection button please note that any remaining budget will be shifted forward to the next year this implies that the ministry of transport and water management will be able to spend more money on projects that fall within their responsibility in the next year in the instruction video we further explain how you can sort the projects compare the projects by one of the impacts and find out more about the impacts of projects through clicking on an information button fig 2 presents a screenshot of the page where respondents could select projects fig 3 presents a screenshot of a page where respondents could find more information about a project respondents in the experiment could make the choice to delegate their decision to an expert two civil servants and one academic this delegation option recognises that some of the respondents might find the experiment to complicated or burdensome or find it more rational to put their trust in the expertise of experts in the context of this decision problem these experts also made their choices in the experiment when participants delegated their choice was replaced by the choice of the selected delegate in the empirical analysis it is possible to redo this analysis without these delegated choices in order to see whether the results differ furthermore the option is useful as it might reduce protest responses in the survey after respondents selected their preferred portfolio they were asked to motivate their choices for each project they selected these motivations provide valuable insights into the qualitative reasons why some of the projects were chosen at the end of the survey respondents were asked to evaluate several aspects of the pve the survey company kantar public was asked to provide two random samples of dutch citizens of 18 years and older and we used a between subjects design for our study 2900 respondents participated in the experiments out of which 937 respondents were specifically recruited in the areas adjacent to the river de waal all respondents who finished the experiment received a financial compensation from the survey company in case respondents delegated their choice they received a lower financial compensation around 1 euro the use of different incentives for providing an advice or delegating might muddle the preference elicitation process at the margin if getting extra euros from the survey company is more important for respondents than making the right choice then they might go ahead and click through just to get the extra euro even if absent the monetary incentive they think it is better if an expert makes the call notwithstanding this drawback we decided to provide respondents who delegated with a lower financial compensation because we were concerned that many respondents would choose for delegation when we would give them the same financial compensation the underlying reason for this decision is that this was the first time that we applied the pve method and we wanted to learn as much as possible from the responses of the participants overall we found ample room for improvements while conducting this pve study we recommended the policy makers who commissioned the study to keep this in mind when interpreting the results of the study the next subsection discusses the results from the case study 4 2 results in the fixed budget pve 266 out of 1855 respondents delegated their choice to an expert 14 and in the flexible budget pve 223 out of 1045 respondents delegated 21 the fact that more individuals delegated in the flexible budget pve may be the result of the increased complexity of the choice task in this experimental setting on the other hand it is surprising that a relatively large number of respondents delegated a choice to an expert that might affect their private income in the fixed budget pve 2 1 of the respondents fully exhausted the budget which is partly a result of the limited number of project portfolios available that would exhaust the public budget in the flexible budget pve the percentage of the respondents who fully exhausted the budget was a bit higher 6 8 fig 4 provides more detailed information with regard to the size of the budget that was shifted forward in the two experimental settings 620 respondents participating in the flexible budget pve did not change the budget 122 respondents decreased the budget and 82 respondents increased the budget see fig 5 for more detailed information on the extent to which respondents changed the budget we did not find a significant correlation between the income of the respondent and their decision to change the budget however the single respondent who selected the null portfolio choosing for the classical project at each location and a maximal reduction in budget was an individual with a very low income after participants of the flexible budget pve completed the experiment we asked them why they decided not to change the budget most respondents who increased the budget stressed the importance of biodiversity and said that the relatively low tax increase that was needed to improve biodiversity urged them to increase the budget many respondents who decreased the budget referred to low importance of the projects among which they could choose moreover a group of participants argued that they reduced the budget because they had a negative stance towards government spending in general for instance one respondent argued i think that taxes should be as low as possible only the most essential tasks should be conducted and financed by the government many of the respondents who did not change the budget argued that the government would have a good reason for setting the budget at this level and they found it risky to overrule such a decision another group of respondents stated that they did not decrease the budget because they thought that it would be good if the government had some financial reserves in case of a setback for instance one respondent argued i didn t decrease the budget because such projects always face cost overruns various respondents argued that they did not increase the budget because they thought that the government should respect its budget fig 6 presents the market shares of the different projects for the respondents who did not delegate their decision to an expert to check for spatial differentiation in project choices both the market shares for the full sample the netherlands and for the respondents recruited in the waal area are reported for each project the average costs presented to the sample are also displayed in all four locations the majority of respondents selected the combination project in the fixed budget pve and the flexible budget pve respectively 39 1 and 40 9 of the respondents selected the combination project at all four locations the classical project was selected at all four locations by 7 0 of the respondents fixed budget pve and 7 6 of the respondents flexible budget pve strikingly the results did not differ very much between the respondents living close to the river waal and random sample of dutch citizens a proportions test revealed that at the 5 significance level only for the road project joure a6 a7 motorway and the project mitigating heavy rainfall at hooge boezem were selected more often by respondents from the random sample of the dutch population than respondents living in the waal area overall the results of the fixed and flexible budget pve are quite similar a proportions test across the fixed and flexible budget pve reveals that only for the road expansion a2 motorway we observe a significant difference in proportions between the fixed and flexible pve samples at the 5 significance level although the comparisons between the two samples is not entirely fair e g in the flexible budget pve respondents were allowed to change the budget and respondents in the fixed budget pve did not have this option we take this as evidence that the two samples are largely comparable the chosen policy portfolios are quantitatively analysed using advanced discrete continuous choice models more details on the modelling can be found in the supplementary material we estimate taste parameters in order to derive the relevance of social impacts associated with the projects comparable to attributes in stated preference surveys this analysis revealed that participants particularly preferred the combination projects over the classical projects when the former projects would positively influence biodiversity and recreational opportunities see the supplementary material for more detailed information respondents answers to the question why they selected the combination projects also show that improved recreational opportunities and variety in biodiversity are the main reasons for choosing these projects however we also inferred from these qualitative motivations that participants mentioned reasons that were not linked to the impacts for which they received explicit information in the pve for instance respondents argued that they selected combination projects because they believe that this solution to mitigate flood risk is aesthetically superior and is more future proof moreover various respondents stated that they selected the road project joure a6 a7 motorway which is located in the north of the netherlands for reasons of spatial fairness these respondents believe that issues in the urban areas in the western part of the country receive too much attention compared to issues in the periphery see for instance the following statement of a respondent the north and the south of the netherlands are always forgotten by the west politicians have no problem with spending millions of euros on congestion issues in the western part of the country but they should also have an eye for issues in other parts of the country hence we estimate so called project specific parameters for each project which captures the utility individuals derive from a project irrespective of the level of the impacts included explicitly in the pve comparable to alternative specific constants in stated preference surveys the obtained results can be used to inform policy makers about the desirability of the various policies and projects see the supplementary material for the technical details and 14 for the generic microeconomic framework of participatory value evaluation a first useful output of the analysis is the probability that an individual project improves social welfare compared to shifting the required budget to the next period in other words it reveals the probability that the project provides value for money fig 7 shows that all the combination projects provide value for money for instance choosing the combination project at gendtse waard has an 86 probability to improve social welfare compared to choosing for the classical project at this location and shifting the difference in costs in this case 5 million euro to the next year 6 6 if all the participants in the pve would have selected the null portfolio they would have recommended to implement the classical project at each of the four locations and shift the remaining public budget to the next year in that case the probability that one of the combination projects improves social welfare would have approached 0 the project desirability of the road expansion of the a2 motorway is only 31 its low probability to provide value for money over shifting the required public budget to the next year implies the project should not be implemented irrespective of the available budget a second useful output of the analysis is the ranking of portfolios of projects in terms of expected social welfare when the public budget is unlimited policy makers could opt for all projects with a desirability probability of higher than 50 the combination projects at all four locations and the projects moerwijk venlo hooge boezem driemanspolder and joure however in reality policy makers are faced with limited budgets and pve also allows for the identification of the optimal selection of projects i e the optimal portfolio for a given budget fig 8 shows the top 10 of portfolios within a budget constraint of 688 million euros we used the average budget recommended in the flexible budget pve 688 million euros as the budget constraint this implies a tax decrease of 1 5 euro per household in 2019 based on these results we can draw three main conclusions 1 the large road project road expansion a2 motorway is not included in all the top 10 portfolio s 2 at the locations sleeuwijk and werkendam the combination project is included in all the top 10 portfolio s 3 the optimal portfolio opts for the combination project in all four locations in order to see whether these conclusions are robust to changes in assumptions concerning the level of the social impacts included in the experiment e g costs and impact on biodiversity we performed various sensitivity analyses see the supplementary material these sensitivity analyses reveal that the first two conclusions are highly robust to changes in assumptions however when we assume a very low impact of the combination projects on biodiversity and recreational opportunities the combination project is not included in the optimal portfolio at the location oosterhout 4 3 experiences of participants and policy makers policy makers who commissioned the pve case study presented the results of the study both within and outside the ministry in the presentations they stated that a useful insight for them was that both the quantitative and qualitative information from the pve indicate that citizens particularly prefer the combination projects over the classical projects when the former projects positively influence biodiversity and recreational opportunities moreover policy makers found it interesting to learn which type of projects citizens are willing to sacrifice to enable them to choose the more expensive combination project instead of the cheaper classical project for instance citizens are willing to sacrifice the large road project road expansion a2 motorway to make way for more expensive combination projects which foster biodiversity and recreation policy makers also argued that a strength of pve concerns the facilitation of mass participation of citizens in the evaluation of public policies a key benefit of pve compared to existing approaches for citizen participation e g public hearings and citizen juries is that the entry barriers for participating are relatively low participants generally spend 20 30 min before submitting their choice s and the respondents can choose themselves when and where they conduct the pve as a result of the low entry barriers not only the passionate proponents and opponents but also the so called silent majority can participate in the evaluation of public policies the socio demographics of the respondents see the supplementary materials reveal that all relevant segments of the population are represented in the final part of the pve experiment participants were asked about the extent to which they agreed with four propositions all four propositions were evaluated in a positive way 1 i was convinced of my choices 24 strongly agree 55 agree 18 neutral 2 disagree 1 strongly disagree i thought that the experiment was realistic 16 strongly agree 45 agree 27 neutral 10 disagree 2 strongly disagree 3 i think it is good that the government aims to involve citizens in making choices between projects in the experiment 41 strongly agree 42 agree 12 neutral 5 disagree 1 strongly disagree 4 this experiment provides the government with relevant information for making choices between projects 19 strongly agree 46 agree 26 neutral 7 disagree 1 strongly disagree the fact that more than 80 of the participants in the case study agreed that it is good that the ministry of transport and water management involved citizens in the evaluation of policy options indicates that there is a clear demand for public participation among dutch citizens possibly pve can be a response to this demand besides responding to the four statements mentioned above participants in the pve were asked to provide qualitative feedback with regard to the pve experiment in which they participated various citizens argued that they thought that participating in a pve is a nice way to get involved into policymaking and to ensure that their voices are heard they liked the fact that they are invited to make a strategic choice that is close to the dilemma policy makers face moreover citizens who participated in the pves argued that it raised their awareness concerning the dilemmas policy makers are faced with in making complex decisions because they have to make consequential choices themselves for instance citizens learned about scarcity of public resources not everything is possible and the cons and pros of the alternative policy options apart from the respondents who were positive about pve we saw that 1 of the respondents strongly disagreed with the statement this experiment provides the government with relevant information for making choices between projects when analysing the experiences of these respondents we saw that some of them thought that the experiment was too simplistic to provide policy makers with solid information to underpin political decisions whereas other respondents struggled with the complexity of the experiment apart from the respondents that questioned their own ability to complete the experiments another group of respondents questioned the extent to which respondents with low levels of education were able to complete the choice tasks some negative respondents thought that complex decisions regarding flood protection should be left to experts instead of the general public finally various respondents criticised the lack of transparency with regard to the selection of the projects that were part of the experiment and some even stated that they wanted to be involved in this selection process 5 discussion this paper started out by extending the welfare framework for the evaluation of public expenditure as presented by bergstrom et al 13 with the purpose of aligning the participatory value evaluation pve survey method with the kaldor hicks efficiency criteria underlying the cost benefit analysis cba framework the fixed budget pve survey format which concerns the optimal allocation of public budget allows deriving the compensating tax reallocation ctr measures as obtained from bergstrom et al 13 s willingeness to allocate public budget wtapb experiments the fixed budget pve survey format makes the shadow price of public budget directly insightful to respondents improving the validity of the ctr welfare measure relative to wtapb a further contribution is made through the flexible budget pve survey format which allows connecting and under the assumption of perfect fungibility of the private and public budget equating the ctr welfare measure to the traditional consumer surplus cs measure this is achieved by allowing respondents to adjust the size of public budget through the tax system and thereby connecting the private and public budget several arguments have been provided in section 3 as to why fixed and flexible pve surveys are considered relevant alternatives to traditional private willingness to pay wtp studies these include the need to elicit preferences for public policies and corresponding trade offs in the context of the actual policy context as opposed to the use of private markets the opportunity to solve coordination problems alike public wtp studies and that public policies are typically financed from public budgets as opposed to private budgets alike wtapb bergstrom et al 13 do recognise that such context specific welfare measures pose challenges for the transfer of such values to other policy contexts and these reflections translate to the pve framework on the other hand it can be argued that decisions on the allocation of vast amounts of public budget 700 million euro in the context of this case study warrant a context specific welfare analysis to illustrate the pve framework we presented a case study regarding projects mitigating flood risks in the netherlands the main result of this pve case study is that citizens prefer projects that combine strengthening dikes and give space to the river to flood safely particularly when such projects positively influence biodiversity and recreational opportunities this application was positively evaluated by policy makers who commissioned the case study and by citizens who participated in this case study however we also found that there is ample room for further improvement of which some directions are given below a key limitation of our study is that it was not possible to investigate how the welfare measures from pve studies compare to those from private wtp studies this requires specifically designed experimental setups which were not possible to conduct with the pve case study presented here a second limitation is that pve experiments are complex when compared to conventional private wtp studies we dealt with this issue through offering respondents who find the experiment to complicated or burdensome the option to delegate their choice to an expert moreover it is quite comforting that 89 of the respondents agreed with the statement i was convinced of my choices which indicates that most of the respondents understood the experiment even though the choice tasks in a pve are relatively complex of course the concern remains that participants structurally overestimate their own competence to make a rational choice we recommend further research which investigates whether participants applied simplified heuristics like the attribute non attendance in ce due to the complexity of the choice task and what the effects would be from potential cognitive overload and if there are certain groups of respondents that have a third limitation is that we saw that some respondents criticised pve because they thought that complex government decisions should be left to experts we think it is interesting to give participants in further research projects the option to communicate their opinion regarding the extent to which outcomes of the experiment and expert advice should influence decision making perhaps these critical respondents are more satisfied when they are explicitly asked in a pve to answer this question moreover we think that it is interesting to investigate the merits of new delegation options e g providing participants who delegate with the same financial compensation and also provide participants with the option to delegate to politicians and to analyse whether respondents who adopt different choice strategies make different choices through tracking the behaviour of participants during the experiment how many respondents watch the whole instruction video and how many respondents used the attribute sorting function we wish to emphasize that the purpose of this study is not to claim that pve is superior or inferior to other valuation approaches arguably the appropriateness of using pve or other valuation methods depends on the policy related economic question moreover the normative question about whether pve is not a more appropriate method for the valuation of public goods compared to other approaches also requires more consideration a practical approach to further investigate this question is to evaluate the welfare effects of a set of government projects through both a pve and alternative valuation techniques such as private wtp and evaluate the performance of these two studies on various criteria such as hypothetical bias protest votes confidence of respondents in their choices and the extent to which respondents believe that the study provides the

8669,because the main modes of transmission of the covid 19 virus are respiration and contact who recommends frequent washing of hands with soap under running water for at least 20 s this article investigates how the level of concern about covid 19 affects the likelihood of washing hands frequently in sub saharan africa we discuss the implication of the findings for water scarce environment the study makes use of a unique survey dataset from 12 sub saharan african countries collected in april 2020 first round and may 2020 second round and employs an extended ordered probit model with endogenous covariate the results show that the level of concern about the spread of the virus increases the likelihood of washing hands with soap under running water for a minimum of 20 s at least five times a day the increase in the probability of handwashing due to concern about covid 19 ranges from 3 for benin to 6 3 for south africa the results also show heterogeneous effects across gender and age groups locality and various water sources however in africa the sustainability of the handwashing protocol could be threatened by the severe water scarcity that exists in the region to sustain frequent handwashing sub saharan africa needs an effective strategy for water management and supply keywords covid 19 handwashing water use sub saharan africa jel classification i18 q25 1 introduction in december 2019 the city of wuhan in china recorded cases of covid 19 caused by the sars cov 2 virus by january 30 2020 the world health organisation who declared a virus pandemic of international concern 1 since its identification in wuhan the virus has spread across all continents of the world affecting more than 180 countries in the beginning of march 2020 the total active cases stood at 109 000 with 3 800 deaths 2 as of september 12 2021 the total cumulative confirmed covid 19 cases is over 220 million and 4 5 million deaths globally 3 developed economies in europe north america and asia have been hard hit by the pandemic even though africa might still not have seen its greatest impact already there are predictions about the possible increase in the fatality rate on the continent due to its weak social and economic infrastructure base the global spread of the novel covid 19 virus has negatively affected many health systems around the globe even the most robust ones in addition extended restrictions on movement and other lockdowns did trigger major social and economic crises 4 many economies around the world reported negative economic growth due to the adverse impact of the pandemic on production distribution and consumption according to world bank data 1 1 https data worldbank org indicator ny gdp mktp kd zg the global economy in the year 2020 grew by 3 5 the two main routes for the transmission of covid 19 are respiration and personal contact measures recommended to contain human to human transmission include isolation quarantine social distancing and community containment 5 according to maier and brockmann 6 these measures have proven to be effective in containing the spread of the virus in south korea and china in addition the who unicef 7 have recommended some basic measures to help reduce the spread of covid 19 they include frequent washing of hands for at least 20 s using water and soap handwashing is effective in curbing infectious diseases for instance jefferson et al 8 9 found that handwashing reduced transmission of respiratory viruses by 45 55 for h1n1 influenza saunders hastings et al 10 found that handwashing reduced transmission in human populations by 38 smith et al 11 showed that handwashing effectively reduced transmission of influenza among adults according to the who unicef 7 providing water sanitation and hygiene wash are crucial to protecting human health from all forms of infections including covid 19 the who estimates that before covid 19 lack of access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation hygiene increased the global incidence of disease burden by about 10 in urban areas the estimate showed that the return in saved medical costs and increased productivity for every us 1 investment in basic sanitation is us 2 5 7 the amount saved for rural areas for similar investment in sanitation is us 5 mattioli et al 12 reported that the quantity of water used is associated with less viral contamination of hands hoque 13 estimates that 0 5 2 l of daily water per person enable reduction of faecal contamination the above suggests that applying robust and consistent wash programmes could effectively help contain the spread of the virus however while the washing of hands might be considered a routine gesture in developed economies with proper water resource infrastructure for developing economies such as africa it might be a luxurious endeavour in africa a significant number of people do not have access to handwashing facilities in sub saharan africa about 258 million people lack access to handwashing facilities unicef who joint monitoring programme reports fig 1 shows the plot of the coverage of people without access to handwashing facilities it is clear from the figure that middle western and eastern african regions have the lowest levels of handwashing facilities in the world one of the primary reasons is that the region has acute water shortage problems as baye 14 noted for ethiopia the suboptimal level of access to water and soap makes adopting the recommended handwashing action difficult especially in rural areas equally important to the above discussion is the role of the concern of covid 19 in handwashing behaviours as cases of covid 19 rise we expect that greater concerns would be generated among people and this could induce behaviour changes that includes the washing of hands however there is limited economic analysis of how the level of concern about infectious disease conditioned on other socio demographic factors affects the frequency of handwashing more specifically it is yet to be known how the level of concern generated from the spread of the novel virus affects the number of times a person washes hands this is a critical question especially in sub saharan africa where there is acute water shortage problem the findings from such study have important implications not just on controlling managing the current covid 19 and other existing diseases such as cholera but also preventing other future pandemics that may require water use as one of the treatment mechanisms the aim of this article is to fill this gap by modeling the frequency of handwashing as a function of the level of concern about the novel covid 19 in africa this study is based on survey data from 12 sub saharan african countries collected between april 2nd and april 9th 2020 first round data collection and from april 24th to may 8th 2020 second round data collection by geopoll a simple random sampling technique was used by geopoll to select respondents from their database which consists of a list of mobile subscribers in each country surveyed we employed an extended ordered probit model with an endogenous covariate to address the potential endogeneity associated with concern about covid 19 principal component analysis was used to compute composite indexes based on the individual s sources of information about covid 19 to serve as an instrument for the level of concern about covid 19 we controlled for the effects of age gender water sources and residential type the results show that the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 significantly increases the frequency of handwashing with soap under running water for at least 20 s we also observed heterogeneities of the effect of level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on frequency of handwashing across gender age group water sources and the selected sub saharan african countries given the exsiting lack of access to potable water and handwashing stations with soap and water in this region and the projected spread and persistence of covid 19 our findings generate the need for concern and policy action about water resource provision and management in the region the rest of the study is organised as follows section 2 reviews the relevant theoretical and empirical literature section 3 discusses the method and data section 4 presents the main findings with a discussion and section 5 concludes with some policy recommendations 2 theoretical and empirical literature handwashing is a simple yet effective way to prevent the spread of infections and diseases 15 16 the health belief model 17 the theory of reasoned action 18 and the theory of planned behavior 19 and its extensions 20 underpin most handwashing studies the theory of planned behavior tpb is the most widely used theoretical framework amongst these theories 20 25 tpb suggests that intention which can be influenced by attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral controls is a significant driver of behaviour based on this theory handwashing practices are assumed to be driven by the following positive or negative evaluations social pressures and the individual s assessment of the level of ease or difficulty 26 several studies on handwashing have adopted tpb by focusing only on the behavioural aspects of hand hygiene for instance mackert et al 16 adopted tpb to design a campaign aimed at increasing handwashing behaviours among university students their results show that although students behaviour towards handwashing did not change due to the campaign more students 12 did use soap kitsanapun and yamarat 27 also adopted tpb to assess handwashing behaviours among public health students the authors show that while attitudes towards handwashing are generally favourably high among public health students they usually do not adhere to prescribed handwashing protocols other notable studies that have relied on the tpb framework include white et al 26 and reyes fernandez et al 28 in sub saharan africa seimetz et al 29 adopted tpb to examine school handwashing programs in rural burundi and zimbabwe they show that for both countries self efficacy and social norms were the most effective in changing handwashing behaviours similarly curtis et al 30 reviewed planned motivated and habitual hygiene behaviours in eleven countries including six african countries ghana kenya tanzania uganda and madagascar their results show that whereas education at an early age influences improved handwashing behaviours fear of diseases did not exist except for occasional outbreaks of epidemics like cholera while behavioural factors may limit handwashing practices water scarcity a common characteristic of many developing countries continues to contribute to the low levels of hand hygiene behaviours 14 in a cross sectional study conducted in uganda atuyambe ediau and orach 31 observed that water and soap were not usually available at handwashing facilities and therefore negatively impacted handwashing practices sheth et al 32 in a clinic based study targeted at pregnant women in malawi demonstrate that participants in a water treatment intervention program are more likely to improve the quality of water use and additionally demonstrate better handwashing practices duse da silva and zietsman 33 examine coping hygiene practices in south africa a water scarce country results show that although there is a need for government to expand the provision of water resources education is vital for the promotion of food handling and handwashing practices pengpid and peltzer 34 reviewed hygiene behaviours in african countries they concluded that knowledge and hygiene practices in african communities and healthcare settings are low which they attributed to the availability of resources such as water and soap these studies go on to suggest that in less developed countries where poor health care systems high population densities poor sanitation and water scarcity are the norm a simple act of handwashing proven to limit the transmission and contraction of covid 19 could be a challenge on this note an important issue worthy of discussion is the effect of the concern of pandemic i e covid 19 on handwashing practices the aim of this study is to provide an economic analysis of the effect of concern of covid 19 conditioned on socio demographic characteristics on handwashing practices in africa 2 1 concern for illness and handwashing until the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic simple preventive practices like handwashing was not given much attention in combating illness and diseases the current literature on concern for illness and diseases and the role of handwashing tend to focus on raising awareness about the pandemic and reduce the spread of the infectious disease shook et al 35 looked at the application of the behavioural immune system as distinct from the physiological immune system and how it can be used to create awareness and increase behaviours necessary to avoid diseases and illnesses they noted that the behavioural immune system tends to differ among individuals and sought to find out if these differences were associated with their concern for the pandemic and their willingness to adhere to the covid 19 protocols a national sample of 1 019 americans was used in a regression analysis framework controlling for factors such as the health history political orientation religiosity and demographics of the participants shook et al 35 found their germ aversion and pathogen disgust sensitivity the two measures of the behavioural immune system to be associated with their concern for covid 19 and willingness to engage in disease prevention behaviours individuals who are younger more educated recovered from covid 19 more religious and those with higher income were more willing to frequently adhere to the covid 19 safety protocols the study recommends that adverts about covid 19 must induce a feeling of disgust to encourage individuals to adhere to protocols such as handwashing social distancing and the wearing of facemasks in the kurdistan region of iraq zangana et al 36 examined the factors that determine handwashing behaviors among internally displaced women the study noted that diarrhea is a common killer among individuals displaced by conflicts and discusses how frequent handwashing with soap can drastically reduce or eradicate the problem associated with the disease the study used two camps in the kurdistan region of iraq as the case study and employed the barrier analysis standard tabulation sheet to achieve its objectives in all 45 doers those who handwash and 45 non doers those who do not handwash were used for the study results showed that no significant difference was observed between doers and non doers in terms of factors such as self and action efficacy and the level of access to soap and water the study also revealed that non doers don t handwash because they find it hard to remember and they perceive the vulnerability and severity of the disease less the study recommends that handwashing must be made convenient especially for non doers to encourage them to do so rahman et al 37 also examined personal hygiene among university students of dhaka bangladesh their study sought to know if the covid 19 pandemic had illicit changes in their practice of hygiene a total of 240 students were selected from different universities within bangladesh findings show that about 40 percent of respondents practiced frequent handwashing while 60 percent of respondents have random durations of hand washing it was also revealed how covid 19 pandemic impacted their hygiene practices and adherence to the recommended protocols in assessing hand hygiene compliance among students of health education onoigboria et al 38 used 200 health education students of the ambrose alli university in nigeria they revealed a high level of compliance to hand hygiene among students of health education but no significant difference was observed between compliance of male and female students to improve hand hygiene among students their study recommends a multifaceted approach at both individual and faculty levels according to thorpe et al 39 handwashing behaviour of individuals is associated with individuals disgust sensitivity which is linked to health anxiety of individuals and their compulsion levels to wash their hands 2 2 water pricing use and financial sustainability water use pricing and cost recovery have been major concerns for providers shen and wu 40 reviewed the reforms in the pricing of water in china their study noted that while a comprehensive policy has been developed for the reform its execution tends to deviate based on environmental social and economic considerations in ghana and most developing countries access to safe drinking water for individuals in most rural areas is a luxury a good number of individuals rely on unclean sources of water for drinking and other domestic activities agyapong et al 41 looked at how financially sustainable water systems can be provided for these deprived communities and the best way to recover the cost of these infrastructures the study noted that proper skills in managing the systems finances will be important for prudent use of generated revenues conducting frequent maintenance of the system and productivity improvement more recently massarutto 42 discussed the interconnections among water pricing supply of water and sanitation the study recognized the pricing of water as a pivot in addressing economic and social issues such as efficient allocation of water resources appraisal of financial investments and the safeguarding of the rights of individuals although efficient water pricing will not solve all economic and social problems the study acknowledged that policymakers can use it to solve many issues regarding water resources especially their sustainability garcia lopez and montano 43 also assessed the tariffs of households in spain focusing on factors that explain the consumption of water by households and the differences across different regions they show that prices tend to be high where the water resource is relatively scarce and low when it is readily available this is consistent with the economic theory of supply as the availability of the water resource influences the cost and the consequent prices the study recommends that policies must target the balancing of prices across the regions garcía lópez et al 44 also confirms these results the current rate of water consumption suggests that water resource may be a scarce commodity in the future if relevant authorities fail to take action efforts must gear towards protecting the resource and popularizing its prudent use this will ensure an appropriate attitude from users and management and lead to the conservation of the resource sanabria and torres 45 introduced a framework that connects the valuation of the resource cost and the sustainability of the environment to promote efficient use of water and ensure that posterity does not suffer from water scarcity to capture the uncertainty that surrounds sustaining the environment and its resources the study recommended the use of stochastic models pinto et al 46 also investigated the negative effect of climate change on the delivery of utilities such as water it emphasized the recurrent scarcity of water as one of the many consequences of climate change on the environment this problem is fueled by factors such as inadequate infrastructure and the fact that resources are contaminated and over exploited the study further mentioned that an adequate supply of water will depend on the level of readiness with regards to important aspects such as demand for water it s pricing cost of the utility as well as the availability of the resource they showed that water supply tariffs must be reduced between 10 and 44 percent for lower consumers and raised between 3 and 106 percent for higher consumers in line with the availability of the water resource while our study is unable to control for the cost of using water due to data availability highlighting the importance of water use pricing and financial sustainability provides key insights on the role of price and water use 3 methodology and data 3 1 conceptual framework conceptually this study builds on the integrated social and economic household water model by jorgensen et al 47 to include the current covid 19 crisis and handwashing behaviours previous studies suggest that demographics socioeconomic factors and household characteristics and composition which include household size land area location income appliances and the presence of pool facilities influence the consumption levels of water 48 50 another major determinant of water consumption is pricing renwick and archibald 50 suggest that low income households are more likely than higher income households to respond to price increments similarly kenney et al 51 show that price is an essential driver of residential water demand and additionally identify restrictions and climate weather as contributing factors of water consumption past water use habits institutional and interpersonal trust personal characteristics such as social norms behavioural control attitudes and perceived risk of shortages can equally affect water use 52 57 jorgensen et al 47 in their integrated framework discuss these factors based on the empirical model of corral verdugo et al 58 in fig 2 we modify the integrated framework of jorgensen et al 47 to reflect handwashing behaviours and individuals level of concern about covid 19 we hypothesize that an individual s level of concern about covid 19 will positively impact handwashing thereby increasing water use also based on the theory of planned behaviour social norms attitudes and perceived behavioural controls may further influence the perceptions and level of concern about covid 19 which will affect the intention to engage in handwashing however these underlying behaviours will depend on exogenous factors including the scarcity or availability of water given that sub saharan africa is not a water sufficient region it is likely that the ongoing handwashing campaigns across countries due to the covid 19 pandemic may be impacted by insufficient access to clean water resources our proposed framework explicitly accounts for water scarcity as depicted in fig 2 3 2 empirical estimation based on the reviewed literature and the conceptual framework discussed we model the frequency of handwashing as a function of the level of concern about covid 19 socioeconomic and demographic factors and other control variables our outcome variable that is frequency per day of handwashing under running water with soap for 20 s is ordinal in nature that is 0 times 1 2 times 3 5 times and more than 5 times the empirical model is specified in equation 1 1 y i k j t β 0 β 1 c o v i d c o n c e r n i k j t x i k j t β μ k j η j γ t ε i k j t where the subscripts i k j a n d t represent the observation for each individual community administrative unit country and survey wave respectively the outcome variable y is a latent variable ranging from 0 to and c o v i d c o n c e r n is a variable capturing the individual s level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on a scale of 1 5 with 1 being not concerned and 5 being very concerned the individual is asked to indicate their level of concern about the spread of covid 19 in their respective country the vector x i represents socioeconomic and demographic factors and other control variables such as gender age water source captured as whether water source is located inside house inside compound or outside compound locality that is urban rural administrative unit fixed effect μ k j country fixed effect η j and survey wave fixed effect γ t the random error term is captured as ε i k j t the observed response categories of frequency of handwashing are tied to the latent variable by the measurement model below 2 y i k j t 1 0 t i m e s i f y i k j t 0 2 1 2 t i m e s i f 0 y i k j t 2 3 3 5 t i m e s i f 2 y i k j t 5 4 5 p l u s t i m e s i f 5 y i k j t from the expression above the observed category y i k j t changes value when the latent variable y crosses a threshold given the nature of the outcome variable we estimate the empirical model using an extended ordered probit technique the level of concern about covid 19 spread is probably endogenous and this may bias our estimate if not accounted for to resolve this potential problem we applied the principal component analysis pca to generate a composite index from the individual s sources of information regarding covid 19 that is newspapers tv radio social media friends family government messages and other and this serves as an instrument for the level of concern about covid 19 based on the pca one component had eigen value strictly greater than one see table a1 in the appendix and it explained about 30 of the variation in the indicators of sources of information regarding covid 19 the oblique rotation of pc loadings in table a2 in the appendix shows that the component consists of the following information sources friends family government media newspapers social media and radio this component is used as instrument for level of concern about covid 19 consequently we estimate an extended ordered probit model with an endogenous covariate 2 2 we used the eoprobit command in stata which uses an instrument for the endogenous covariate that is level of concern about covid 19 in our case the source of information regarding covid 19 is likely to affect an individual s knowledge about covid 19 hence influencing his her concern about the spread of the virus this implies that the sources of information about covid 19 are important factors affecting an individual s level of concern about covid 19 thus the relevance assumption is satisfied also our instrument is likely to satisfy the exclusion restriction assumption since the source of information regarding covid 19 can only affect the frequency of handwashing if one is concerned about the spread of covid 19 and therefore adheres to the safety protocols such as washing of hands under running water with soap for at least 20 s to prevent infection thus our composite indexes obtained from the sources of information are correlated with the level of concern about covid 19 but uncorrelated with the frequency of handwashing our formal test as shown in section 4 results and discussion and table a3 in appendix proves the validity of the instrument from existing data from the who the distribution of covid 19 infection and fatalities have some demographic dimensions as a result our study considers subsample analysis across gender and age groups moreover access to running water which is an important element for frequent handwashing differs across rural and urban areas hence subsample analysis focusing on these areas is relevant we further examine the heterogenous effects of concerns about covid 19 spread on the frequency of handwash across various water sources that is whether water is sourced from inside house inside compound or outside compound as covid 19 responses and access to running water vary across countries we expect the effect of the level of concern about covid 19 on the frequency of handwashing to be heterogeneous thus in addition to the pooled analysis we provide country specific analysis of the issue income level of individuals or households has the potential of affecting the individual s access to water however our dataset does not contain income levels which makes it impossible for the authors to undertake income level analysis that notwithstanding we consider two variables from our dataset which potentially could enable us learn about the economic status of individuals these variables are i food worries due to lack of money or other resources and ii individual s concerns about economic impact of covid 19 thus as food worries in this case is linked to lack of money or other resources we deduce that those who are not worried about food relatively have higher economic status than those who are worried similarly those who are not concerned about the economic impact of covid 19 could be said to be economically financially stable or comfortable relative to those who are very concerned about the economic impact of the virus based on these two variables we further investigate the heterogenous effect of concerns about local spread of covid 19 on the frequency of handwash across the following groups a food worries versus no food worries and b concerned about economic impact versus not concerned about economic impact of covid 19 the standard errors in our estimations are clustered at the primary administrative unit to account for possible correlation in the residual of the frequency of handwashing among individuals within the same community by clustering the standard errors at the community level we adjust the standard errors for inference following chiwona karltun et al 59 based on their covid 19 study access to water and water pricing may be similar for individuals living in the same community however our dataset does not have information on these and other relevant factors which may affect the frequency of handwashing and could correlate among individuals by controlling for primary administrative units community level fixed effect we are able to account for water supply and water prices which are normally homogeneous at community level 3 3 data and sampling design the data for this study is based on an open access survey designed and collected by geopoll 3 3 geopoll dataset can be accessed from https data humdata org dataset covid 19 impacts africa the survey instrument can also be obtained from the same website the dataset for both waves was directly requested from geopoll two rounds of the survey were administered through sms and mobile web the first round occurred between april 2nd and april 9th 2020 and the second round from april 24th to may 8th 2020 the data comprises of 12 sub saharan african countries benin the democratic republic of congo ghana ivory coast nigeria rwanda south africa kenya mozambique zambia t country and u country 4 4 geopoll insists on making t country and u country anonymous this is because the authorities from these countries did not give geopoll permission to carryout country level analysis based on data from these countries interested readers can contact the authors for the identification of these countries the second round ran in all countries except for t country and u country for the first round a total sample of 4 788 was collected across the 12 countries in africa with each country having a sample of 400 except drc which had a sample size of 388 the second round had a sample size of 3994 with 400 from each country with the exception of rwanda which had a sample size of 394 these sample sizes give a 5 margin of error and a 95 confidence interval for each round a simple random sampling technique was used by geopoll to select respondents from their database which consists of a list of mobile subscribers in each country surveyed the sample is made up of literate adults with access to mobile phones hence reaching relatively wealthier population the sample was roughly nationally representative by age gender and location the survey was administered in english french portuguese swahili and kinyarwanda depending on country table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the variables of interest for this study about 54 6 of the sample were washing their hands for 20 s more than 5 times a day prior to the survey however 4 2 did not wash their hands for 20 s during the same period among individuals who wash their hands for more than 5 times a day for at least 20 s under running water with soap kenya has the highest proportion of individuals that is 65 6 while ivory coast has the least that is 45 5 however among those who do not wash their hands under running water with soap for at least 20 s mozambique recorded the highest rate of 7 1 followed by ivory coast 6 with ghana recording the lowest rate of 1 9 about 39 4 of respondents indicated that they sourced water outside their compound 31 3 sourced water from inside their house and about 29 3 sourced water from inside their compound 5 5 it should be noted that the question on sources of water was only asked in the first wave of the survey also the questionnaire in south africa did not include questions on water sources in both waves since not all respondents in the first wave responded in the second wave and new respondents were included in the second wave we restrict the descriptive statistics for water sources on the data from the first wave from table 1 south africa is the country with the highest access to basic drinking water with a rate of 93 9 followed by ghana with a rate of 85 8 the country with the least rate of access to basic drinking water is democratic republic of congo 46 who unicef defines basic drinking water services to comprise of drinking water from an improved source provided collection time is not more than 30 min for a round trip these improved water sources according to who unicef are piped water boreholes or tube wells protected dug wells protected springs and packaged or delivered water 6 6 world development indicators https databank worldbank org source world development indicators in the case of access to handwashing facility with soap and water the countries have rates less than 50 rwanda has the least rate of access to handwashing facility with soap and water with a rate of 4 6 according to the world bank s world development indicators handwashing facilities may be fixed or mobile and include a sink with tap water buckets with taps tippy taps and jugs or basins designated for handwashing and soap includes bar soap liquid soap powder detergent and soapy water but does not include ash soil sand or other handwashing agents thus the who unicef defines a basic handwashing facility as a device to contain transport or regulate the flow of water to facilitate handwashing with soap and water in the household 7 7 world development indicators https databank worldbank org source world development indicators generally the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 is relatively high with an average score of about 4 26 the country with the highest score of concern about the local spread of covid 19 during the periods of the survey is south africa with a score of 4 59 followed by ghana with a score of 4 57 however during the same period democratic republic of congo scored the lowest rate on concern about the local spread of covid 19 having a score of 3 35 the sample comprises of about 45 females and 67 of the total sample live in urban areas the age of respondents ranges from 18 to 91 years with an average age of about 31 years the majority of individuals that is 71 are less than 35 years and only 1 4 of the sample are aged 60 years and above 4 results and discussions in table 2 we estimate ordered probit models with and without an endogenous covariate in each case we estimate the model with and without country fixed effect however we controlled for survey wave and primary administrative unit fixed effects in all the models in columns 3 and 6 of table 2 we controlled for individual s source of water this results to a drop in the number of observation from 8 782 to 6 816 due to the fact that the question on sources of water was only asked in the first wave of the survey and not all respondents were in both waves also the questionnaire for south africa did not include questions on water sources in both waves thus the number of observation of 6 816 comprises of 4 388 respondents from the first wave and 2 428 of respondents from the first wave who also responded in the second wave as stated earlier the level of concern about covid 19 is treated as endogenous and we use the derived composite index based on the individual s sources of information as an instrument from the extended ordered probit model with endogenous covariate the composite index that is comp1 which serve as instrumental variable for the level of concern about covid 19 significantly explain the endogenous variable see table a3 in the appendix this satisfies the relevance assumption in addition there exists a significant correlation between the error term of the structural model that is handwashing model and the error term of the model of the level of concern about covid 19 this indicates that the variable representing the level of concern about covid 19 is indeed an endogenous covariate and as we account for the endogeneity our estimate for the level of concern about covid 19 approaches its true estimate furthermore the cragg donald f statistics and the hansen j statistics for overidentification show that our instrument is valid columns 1 to 3 of table 2 do not address the problem of endogeneity associated with the level of concern about covid 19 whereas columns 4 to 6 do from all the models the frequency of handwashing is significantly explained by age level of concern about covid 19 gender and source of water in models in columns 3 and 6 our models of interest are column 5 and 6 which accounts for primary administrative unit country and wave fixed effects and also the endogeneity of the level of concern about covid 19 the results show that the frequency of handwashing increases with the level of concern about covid 19 that is as the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 increases individuals tend to increase the number of times they wash their hands under running water for at least 20 s as prescribed by who as a way of reducing infection this corroborates the assertion by borghi guinness curtis 15 and mackert liang champlin 16 that handwashing is used to prevent the spread of infections and diseases the results also support the theory of planned behaviour which suggests that intention influenced by attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioural controls is a significant driver of behaviour which in our case is handwashing 26 moreover the results are consistent with those of curtis et al 30 who based on a review of eleven countries with six from africa found that education and fear during occasional outbreaks of epidemics like cholera encourage handwashing furthermore the findings corroborate that of shook et al 35 who relate individual s germ aversion and pathogen disgust sensitivity that is concern for covid 19 to willingness to engage in disease prevention behaviours also thorpe et al 39 stipulate that handwashing behaviour of individuals is associated with individuals health anxiety and their compulsion levels to wash their hands table 3 presents the marginal effect based on our estimation it shows the marginal change in the probability of the outcome that is frequency of handwashing 0 times 1 2 times 3 5 times and more than 5 times resulting from marginal change of each covariate we find that a marginal increase in the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 decreases the probability of individuals not washing their hands with soap under running water for 20 s it also decreases the probability of individuals washing their hands 1 2 times and 3 5 times however it increases the probability of they washing their hands more than 5 times due to the concern about the spread of covid 19 the probability of frequency of handwashing 0 times 1 2 times 3 5 times and more than 5 times changes on the order of 0 007 0 008 0 014 0 011 0 010 and 0 033 0 031 respectively with a marginal increase in level of concern about the spread of covid 19 it should be noted that across all categories of frequency of handwashing the average marginal effects must sum to zero this is because any increase in the probability of one category must be offset by a decrease in another category from the descriptive statistics in table 1 it should be recalled that the proportion of individuals washing their hands more than 5 times is relatively more than the other groups hence the marginal change for washing hands for more than 5 times is expected to be relatively higher this explains the negative marginal effect for those not washing their hands washing hands for 1 2 times and 3 5 times in the case of age we find a non linear relationship between age and the frequency of handwashing see table 2 thus the frequency of handwashing increases with age and later reduces after a certain threshold that is about 52 years based on the model with all the sample it should be noted that this quadratic relationship is between age and frequency of handwashing and concern about local spread of covid 19 has no bearing on this relationship the marginal effect evaluated at the sample mean suggests that a marginal increase in age decreases the probability of not washing hands and of washing hands 1 2 times and 3 5 times but increases the probability of handwashing more than 5 times see table 3 in the case of gender the results show a significant difference between females and males in the frequency of handwashing females wash their hands relatively more frequently than males see table 2 from the marginal effect estimation in table 3 a change from male to female decreases the probability of not washing hands or washing hands 1 2 times and 3 5 times but increases the probability of handwashing more than 5 times in most developing countries women and girls are responsible for collecting water and are the main users and managers of water as they are mainly responsible for cooking laundry and other household chores like fetching water 60 moreover women are responsible for enforcing hygienic practices in home environments this may explain why females frequently wash their hands relative to males our results show a statistically significant effect of source of water on frequency of handwash from table 2 individuals who source water from outside their compound are less likely to wash this hands under running water with soap for at least 20 s relative to those who source water from inside their compound the marginal effect from table 3 shows that an individual changing his her water source from inside compound to outside compound increases the probability of not washing hands or washing hands 1 2 times and 3 5 times but decreases the probability of handwashing more than 5 times similar result is found when an individual changes his her water source from inside house to outside compound however the marginal effect is relatively higher in this case 4 1 heterogeneous effect of level of concern about covid 19 on frequency of handwashing covid 19 infections and fatalities have demographic dimensions varying across gender and age groups as a result we estimate the model for different gender and age groups and also based on locality that is urban rural source of water and economic status from table 4 and table 5 we find a significant effect of level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on the frequency of handwashing across all categories except those sourcing water from inside their house with variability in the magnitude of the effects for gender we observed this effect is higher for females relative to males however there is no statiscally significent different between effect for males and females as shown by the hausman s test there is therefore more potential for both males and females to increase their hand washing due to covid 19 concerns the age group analysis shows that the effect of the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on the frequency of handwashing increases with higher age cohort thus as those in older age group tend to be more concern about the local spread of covid 19 they are likely to follow the preventive protocol of handwashing because old age is associated with the severity and mortality of patients with covid 19 61 and most older individuals have underlying health conditions especially in sub saharan africa they tend to be more concerned about the spread of the virus this is observed from our data given their relatively high risk level it is reassuring to see that older individuals tend to adhere more to the protocols prescribed by health authorities in preventing infections from covid 19 hence washing their hands more frequently with soap under running water for at least 20 s although the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 increases the frequency of handwashing in both rural and urban areas surprisingly the effect is relatively higher in rural areas this could be due to several reasons first the frequent washing of hands may be seen as a critical preventive measure for covid 19 in rural areas where they mostly either lack or have deficient health infrastructure currently most treatment centres in sub saharan africa are located in urban areas second the poor economic status of most rural residents could make it more challenging if not impossible to acquire protective equipment such as hand sanitisers face masks and personal protective equipment in china a survey conducted in january 2020 revealed that about 63 3 of rural communities either could not buy face masks or had difficulty in buying face masks 62 63 the sub sample analysis based on individuals water sources shows that an increase in the concern about the local spread of covid 19 increases the probability of handwashing in the case of those who sourced water from inside or outside their compound see table 5 although the effect is higher for those who source water from inside compound than for those sourcing water from outside compound we find no statistically significant difference between the two also we investigate the association between concern about local spread of covid 19 and frequency of handwashing for those who are worried or not worried about food due to lack of money or other resources our results show positive association between concern about local spread of covid 19 and frequency of handwash for both those who are worried about food due to lack of money or other resources and those who are not worried see table 5 although the effect is higher for those who are worried about food relative to those not worried the difference between the two groups is not statistically significant similarly we find significant positive correlation between concern about local spread of covid 19 and frequency of handwashing for individuals who are not concern about the economic impact of covid 19 and those who are very concerned about the economic impact the effect of concern about the local spread of covid 19 on frequency of handwashing is higher for those who are very concerned about the covid 19 than those who are not concern about economic impact albeit insignificant statistical difference between the two groups 4 2 country specific analysis given that covid 19 infection and fatality rates government response and access to water differ across countries we examined the effect of the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on the frequency of handwashing for each of the 12 sub saharan african countries in this study the results of the ordered probit estimation are shown in table 6 with the exception of democratic republic of congo nigeria mozambique t country and u country we find that frequency of handwashing with soap under running water for at least 20 s increases with an increase in the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 for all the other countries under study this suggests that individuals in these countries in an attempt to prevent infection tend to follow the prescribed protocol of frequent handwashing with soap under running water for all the countries with significant impact of level of concern of covid 19 on handwashing the marginal effect estimation in table 7 shows that an increase in the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 decreases the probability of not washing hands and washing hands 1 2 times and 3 5 times but increases the probability of handwashing more than 5 times however there is variation of the impact across countries as mentioned earlier the average marginal effects across all categories must sum to zero this is because any increase in the probability of one category must be offset by a decrease in another category from table 7 the increase in the probability of handwashing more than 5 times resulting from an increase in the level of concern about covid 19 for example ranges from 3 for benin to 6 3 for south africa 4 3 implications of our findings for water scarce environment from the results as the level of conern about covid 19 rises the likelihood for people to wash their hands multiple times increases with no sign of decline in covid 19 our first important deduction is that water usage should be increasing to sustain the practice of handwashing however there are two perennial problems with water supply in sub saharan africa that might constraint efforts to sustain the practice of handwashing they include water affordability and access in fact the united nations sustainable development goal target 6 1 aims for universal access and equitable access to safe and affordable water for everyone by 2030 this implies that sustaining efforts to promote the practice of handwashing will require actions on water cost and investment according to the united nations and water supply and sanitation collaborative council cost for water and sanitation services for households should not exceed 5 percent of their income however in sub saharan africa the cost of water takes a significant portion of household income a study by shack slum dwellers international sdi 64 compute the cost of water as a percent of household income for four cities in sub saharan africa blantyre dar es salaam tanzania harare zimbabwe and windhock namibia for piped water only the cost of municipal supply of water for six person household that consumes 50 l per person per day ranges from 11 to a theoretical 112 of household income 64 a more recent global survey in 2019 on global value of water consisting of 44 cities in africa showed a modest increase in tariff of 1 9 and average water tariff of us 1 16 m3 65 however wide disparity was noticed among cities in africa while harare zimbabwe and cape town south africa experienced 62 and 49 decline in water tariff in 2019 respectively in kigali rwanda lome togo durban south africa pretoria south africa windhock namibia johannesburg south africa and accra ghana water tariffs went up by 77 1 19 14 10 9 9 9 9 and 8 respectively in terms of highest and lowest tariff countries water price in addis ababa ethiopia was the lowest us 0 13 m3 but highest in praia cabo verde us 5 17 m3 followed by mbabane eswatini us 4 79 m3 one effective course of actiton may be for governments in africa to implement well thought through cross subsidies particularly for low income households to enable them access water to ensure that water is affordable to all some governments in africa at the peak of the pandemic have provided subsidies on water utility for example the government of ghana absorbed all water bills for all ghanaians from april 2020 to january 2021 66 for households with no home connection to water the government supplied water to their homes also the government of ivory coast paid all water bills for 1 million low income households in april and may 2019 furthermore the government of south africa during the period of the lockdown established hotline support for areas in need of water while these interventions by various governments during the pandemic were critical for long term promotion of handwashing practices which are critical for preventing future pandemics a sustainable subsidy programme that would ease the water expenditure burden of consumers is required second though we found the level of concern about covid 19 raises the likelihood of a person washing his her hands frequently limited access and the severe water scarcity in sub saharan africa could be an important constraint to sustain the practice especially among very vulnerable groups such as the old rural populations and women as shown in table 1 an average of 67 25 of the population in these countries have access to at least basic drinking water and an average of 26 56 of the population have access to basic handwashing facilities including soap and water a simple correlation test between the marginal effect of handwashing for at least 5 times see table 7 and access to water shows a positive statistically significant value of 0 68 implying that an increase in access to water has the potential to increase the frequency of handwashing which is a preventive measure to most viral infection a key problem that makes it difficult for utilities in africa to improve coverage and access involves underinvestment in infrastructure and lack of maintenance for aging infrastructure improving the financial stance of the utilities may prove critical to improve water coverage however in africa a recent world bank report 67 indicate that the link between enhanced financial performance and water coverage is only strong for some group of utilities but when it comes to smaller utilities it is very weak which means such utilities may have to depend on external funds to promote coverage in this regard providing government support especially to small utilities in low income countries could be critical to improving water coverage running a successful subsidy programme to reduce price burden and promote investment in water infrastructure could go a long way to help improve affordability and access however scarcity in water could be naturally imposed poor rains could create acute water supply shortages with obvious implications for water price inflation this implies that in addition having a sustainable subsidy programme to promote afforability and access governments in africa should run parallel programmes to promote water use efficiency in the region for example although south africa has relatively higher access to basic drinking water about 94 and handwashing facilities that is 44 the country has been faced with a water crisis in the recent past 2017 2018 the country resorted to water saving management campaigns as a strategy to manage the water crisis of 2017 2018 68 adopting such a tripartite programme could help sustain the efforts of handwashing with obvious future implications for managing similar pandemics in the future and other communicable diseases such as cholera 5 conclusion this study uses a unique dataset from 12 sub saharan african countries to investigate the effect of the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on the frequency of handwashing with soap under running water for a minimum of 20 s because the infection and fatality rates of covid 19 have demographic dimensions we also considered gender and age group locality and various water sources analysis we found that the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 significantly increases the frequency of handwashing more than 5 times a day we observed that on a normal day females typically wash their hands more frequently than males however of the concern about the spread of covid 19 no statistically significant difference between females and males was found the effect of the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on frequency of handwashing is high for older individuals this could be attributed to the fact that fatalities caused by covid 19 are mostly centered in older age groups who are most likely to suffer from underlying medical conditions the country specific analysis shows a significant effect of concern about the spread of covid 19 on frequency of handwashing for seven out of the twelve countries covid 19 concerns make individuals in these countries more likely to wash their hands with soap under running water for a minimum of 20 s more than 5 times a day with a probability ranging from 3 for benin to 6 3 for south africa from the above we expect that the continuous rise in cases of covid 19 will increase concerns among people and this is projected to impact the number of times people wash their hands with consequences on water usage however already there are concerns about water shortage in africa a situation which suggests that africa countries improve the reliability of water supply by expanding infrastructure and promoting water use efficiency among its citizenry thus without proper water use management and investment in water infrastructure the act of frequent handwashing might be constraint and cause the spread of the virus to increase the situation in sub saharan africa calls for urgent and effective water management and supply strategies in the region the current rate of water consumption suggests that water resource may be a scarce commodity in the future if relevant authorities fail to take action efforts must gear towards protecting the resource and popularizing its prudent use this will ensure an appropriate attitude from users and management and lead to the conservation of the resource in addition proper skills in managing water systems finances will be important for prudent use of

8669,because the main modes of transmission of the covid 19 virus are respiration and contact who recommends frequent washing of hands with soap under running water for at least 20 s this article investigates how the level of concern about covid 19 affects the likelihood of washing hands frequently in sub saharan africa we discuss the implication of the findings for water scarce environment the study makes use of a unique survey dataset from 12 sub saharan african countries collected in april 2020 first round and may 2020 second round and employs an extended ordered probit model with endogenous covariate the results show that the level of concern about the spread of the virus increases the likelihood of washing hands with soap under running water for a minimum of 20 s at least five times a day the increase in the probability of handwashing due to concern about covid 19 ranges from 3 for benin to 6 3 for south africa the results also show heterogeneous effects across gender and age groups locality and various water sources however in africa the sustainability of the handwashing protocol could be threatened by the severe water scarcity that exists in the region to sustain frequent handwashing sub saharan africa needs an effective strategy for water management and supply keywords covid 19 handwashing water use sub saharan africa jel classification i18 q25 1 introduction in december 2019 the city of wuhan in china recorded cases of covid 19 caused by the sars cov 2 virus by january 30 2020 the world health organisation who declared a virus pandemic of international concern 1 since its identification in wuhan the virus has spread across all continents of the world affecting more than 180 countries in the beginning of march 2020 the total active cases stood at 109 000 with 3 800 deaths 2 as of september 12 2021 the total cumulative confirmed covid 19 cases is over 220 million and 4 5 million deaths globally 3 developed economies in europe north america and asia have been hard hit by the pandemic even though africa might still not have seen its greatest impact already there are predictions about the possible increase in the fatality rate on the continent due to its weak social and economic infrastructure base the global spread of the novel covid 19 virus has negatively affected many health systems around the globe even the most robust ones in addition extended restrictions on movement and other lockdowns did trigger major social and economic crises 4 many economies around the world reported negative economic growth due to the adverse impact of the pandemic on production distribution and consumption according to world bank data 1 1 https data worldbank org indicator ny gdp mktp kd zg the global economy in the year 2020 grew by 3 5 the two main routes for the transmission of covid 19 are respiration and personal contact measures recommended to contain human to human transmission include isolation quarantine social distancing and community containment 5 according to maier and brockmann 6 these measures have proven to be effective in containing the spread of the virus in south korea and china in addition the who unicef 7 have recommended some basic measures to help reduce the spread of covid 19 they include frequent washing of hands for at least 20 s using water and soap handwashing is effective in curbing infectious diseases for instance jefferson et al 8 9 found that handwashing reduced transmission of respiratory viruses by 45 55 for h1n1 influenza saunders hastings et al 10 found that handwashing reduced transmission in human populations by 38 smith et al 11 showed that handwashing effectively reduced transmission of influenza among adults according to the who unicef 7 providing water sanitation and hygiene wash are crucial to protecting human health from all forms of infections including covid 19 the who estimates that before covid 19 lack of access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation hygiene increased the global incidence of disease burden by about 10 in urban areas the estimate showed that the return in saved medical costs and increased productivity for every us 1 investment in basic sanitation is us 2 5 7 the amount saved for rural areas for similar investment in sanitation is us 5 mattioli et al 12 reported that the quantity of water used is associated with less viral contamination of hands hoque 13 estimates that 0 5 2 l of daily water per person enable reduction of faecal contamination the above suggests that applying robust and consistent wash programmes could effectively help contain the spread of the virus however while the washing of hands might be considered a routine gesture in developed economies with proper water resource infrastructure for developing economies such as africa it might be a luxurious endeavour in africa a significant number of people do not have access to handwashing facilities in sub saharan africa about 258 million people lack access to handwashing facilities unicef who joint monitoring programme reports fig 1 shows the plot of the coverage of people without access to handwashing facilities it is clear from the figure that middle western and eastern african regions have the lowest levels of handwashing facilities in the world one of the primary reasons is that the region has acute water shortage problems as baye 14 noted for ethiopia the suboptimal level of access to water and soap makes adopting the recommended handwashing action difficult especially in rural areas equally important to the above discussion is the role of the concern of covid 19 in handwashing behaviours as cases of covid 19 rise we expect that greater concerns would be generated among people and this could induce behaviour changes that includes the washing of hands however there is limited economic analysis of how the level of concern about infectious disease conditioned on other socio demographic factors affects the frequency of handwashing more specifically it is yet to be known how the level of concern generated from the spread of the novel virus affects the number of times a person washes hands this is a critical question especially in sub saharan africa where there is acute water shortage problem the findings from such study have important implications not just on controlling managing the current covid 19 and other existing diseases such as cholera but also preventing other future pandemics that may require water use as one of the treatment mechanisms the aim of this article is to fill this gap by modeling the frequency of handwashing as a function of the level of concern about the novel covid 19 in africa this study is based on survey data from 12 sub saharan african countries collected between april 2nd and april 9th 2020 first round data collection and from april 24th to may 8th 2020 second round data collection by geopoll a simple random sampling technique was used by geopoll to select respondents from their database which consists of a list of mobile subscribers in each country surveyed we employed an extended ordered probit model with an endogenous covariate to address the potential endogeneity associated with concern about covid 19 principal component analysis was used to compute composite indexes based on the individual s sources of information about covid 19 to serve as an instrument for the level of concern about covid 19 we controlled for the effects of age gender water sources and residential type the results show that the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 significantly increases the frequency of handwashing with soap under running water for at least 20 s we also observed heterogeneities of the effect of level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on frequency of handwashing across gender age group water sources and the selected sub saharan african countries given the exsiting lack of access to potable water and handwashing stations with soap and water in this region and the projected spread and persistence of covid 19 our findings generate the need for concern and policy action about water resource provision and management in the region the rest of the study is organised as follows section 2 reviews the relevant theoretical and empirical literature section 3 discusses the method and data section 4 presents the main findings with a discussion and section 5 concludes with some policy recommendations 2 theoretical and empirical literature handwashing is a simple yet effective way to prevent the spread of infections and diseases 15 16 the health belief model 17 the theory of reasoned action 18 and the theory of planned behavior 19 and its extensions 20 underpin most handwashing studies the theory of planned behavior tpb is the most widely used theoretical framework amongst these theories 20 25 tpb suggests that intention which can be influenced by attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioral controls is a significant driver of behaviour based on this theory handwashing practices are assumed to be driven by the following positive or negative evaluations social pressures and the individual s assessment of the level of ease or difficulty 26 several studies on handwashing have adopted tpb by focusing only on the behavioural aspects of hand hygiene for instance mackert et al 16 adopted tpb to design a campaign aimed at increasing handwashing behaviours among university students their results show that although students behaviour towards handwashing did not change due to the campaign more students 12 did use soap kitsanapun and yamarat 27 also adopted tpb to assess handwashing behaviours among public health students the authors show that while attitudes towards handwashing are generally favourably high among public health students they usually do not adhere to prescribed handwashing protocols other notable studies that have relied on the tpb framework include white et al 26 and reyes fernandez et al 28 in sub saharan africa seimetz et al 29 adopted tpb to examine school handwashing programs in rural burundi and zimbabwe they show that for both countries self efficacy and social norms were the most effective in changing handwashing behaviours similarly curtis et al 30 reviewed planned motivated and habitual hygiene behaviours in eleven countries including six african countries ghana kenya tanzania uganda and madagascar their results show that whereas education at an early age influences improved handwashing behaviours fear of diseases did not exist except for occasional outbreaks of epidemics like cholera while behavioural factors may limit handwashing practices water scarcity a common characteristic of many developing countries continues to contribute to the low levels of hand hygiene behaviours 14 in a cross sectional study conducted in uganda atuyambe ediau and orach 31 observed that water and soap were not usually available at handwashing facilities and therefore negatively impacted handwashing practices sheth et al 32 in a clinic based study targeted at pregnant women in malawi demonstrate that participants in a water treatment intervention program are more likely to improve the quality of water use and additionally demonstrate better handwashing practices duse da silva and zietsman 33 examine coping hygiene practices in south africa a water scarce country results show that although there is a need for government to expand the provision of water resources education is vital for the promotion of food handling and handwashing practices pengpid and peltzer 34 reviewed hygiene behaviours in african countries they concluded that knowledge and hygiene practices in african communities and healthcare settings are low which they attributed to the availability of resources such as water and soap these studies go on to suggest that in less developed countries where poor health care systems high population densities poor sanitation and water scarcity are the norm a simple act of handwashing proven to limit the transmission and contraction of covid 19 could be a challenge on this note an important issue worthy of discussion is the effect of the concern of pandemic i e covid 19 on handwashing practices the aim of this study is to provide an economic analysis of the effect of concern of covid 19 conditioned on socio demographic characteristics on handwashing practices in africa 2 1 concern for illness and handwashing until the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic simple preventive practices like handwashing was not given much attention in combating illness and diseases the current literature on concern for illness and diseases and the role of handwashing tend to focus on raising awareness about the pandemic and reduce the spread of the infectious disease shook et al 35 looked at the application of the behavioural immune system as distinct from the physiological immune system and how it can be used to create awareness and increase behaviours necessary to avoid diseases and illnesses they noted that the behavioural immune system tends to differ among individuals and sought to find out if these differences were associated with their concern for the pandemic and their willingness to adhere to the covid 19 protocols a national sample of 1 019 americans was used in a regression analysis framework controlling for factors such as the health history political orientation religiosity and demographics of the participants shook et al 35 found their germ aversion and pathogen disgust sensitivity the two measures of the behavioural immune system to be associated with their concern for covid 19 and willingness to engage in disease prevention behaviours individuals who are younger more educated recovered from covid 19 more religious and those with higher income were more willing to frequently adhere to the covid 19 safety protocols the study recommends that adverts about covid 19 must induce a feeling of disgust to encourage individuals to adhere to protocols such as handwashing social distancing and the wearing of facemasks in the kurdistan region of iraq zangana et al 36 examined the factors that determine handwashing behaviors among internally displaced women the study noted that diarrhea is a common killer among individuals displaced by conflicts and discusses how frequent handwashing with soap can drastically reduce or eradicate the problem associated with the disease the study used two camps in the kurdistan region of iraq as the case study and employed the barrier analysis standard tabulation sheet to achieve its objectives in all 45 doers those who handwash and 45 non doers those who do not handwash were used for the study results showed that no significant difference was observed between doers and non doers in terms of factors such as self and action efficacy and the level of access to soap and water the study also revealed that non doers don t handwash because they find it hard to remember and they perceive the vulnerability and severity of the disease less the study recommends that handwashing must be made convenient especially for non doers to encourage them to do so rahman et al 37 also examined personal hygiene among university students of dhaka bangladesh their study sought to know if the covid 19 pandemic had illicit changes in their practice of hygiene a total of 240 students were selected from different universities within bangladesh findings show that about 40 percent of respondents practiced frequent handwashing while 60 percent of respondents have random durations of hand washing it was also revealed how covid 19 pandemic impacted their hygiene practices and adherence to the recommended protocols in assessing hand hygiene compliance among students of health education onoigboria et al 38 used 200 health education students of the ambrose alli university in nigeria they revealed a high level of compliance to hand hygiene among students of health education but no significant difference was observed between compliance of male and female students to improve hand hygiene among students their study recommends a multifaceted approach at both individual and faculty levels according to thorpe et al 39 handwashing behaviour of individuals is associated with individuals disgust sensitivity which is linked to health anxiety of individuals and their compulsion levels to wash their hands 2 2 water pricing use and financial sustainability water use pricing and cost recovery have been major concerns for providers shen and wu 40 reviewed the reforms in the pricing of water in china their study noted that while a comprehensive policy has been developed for the reform its execution tends to deviate based on environmental social and economic considerations in ghana and most developing countries access to safe drinking water for individuals in most rural areas is a luxury a good number of individuals rely on unclean sources of water for drinking and other domestic activities agyapong et al 41 looked at how financially sustainable water systems can be provided for these deprived communities and the best way to recover the cost of these infrastructures the study noted that proper skills in managing the systems finances will be important for prudent use of generated revenues conducting frequent maintenance of the system and productivity improvement more recently massarutto 42 discussed the interconnections among water pricing supply of water and sanitation the study recognized the pricing of water as a pivot in addressing economic and social issues such as efficient allocation of water resources appraisal of financial investments and the safeguarding of the rights of individuals although efficient water pricing will not solve all economic and social problems the study acknowledged that policymakers can use it to solve many issues regarding water resources especially their sustainability garcia lopez and montano 43 also assessed the tariffs of households in spain focusing on factors that explain the consumption of water by households and the differences across different regions they show that prices tend to be high where the water resource is relatively scarce and low when it is readily available this is consistent with the economic theory of supply as the availability of the water resource influences the cost and the consequent prices the study recommends that policies must target the balancing of prices across the regions garcía lópez et al 44 also confirms these results the current rate of water consumption suggests that water resource may be a scarce commodity in the future if relevant authorities fail to take action efforts must gear towards protecting the resource and popularizing its prudent use this will ensure an appropriate attitude from users and management and lead to the conservation of the resource sanabria and torres 45 introduced a framework that connects the valuation of the resource cost and the sustainability of the environment to promote efficient use of water and ensure that posterity does not suffer from water scarcity to capture the uncertainty that surrounds sustaining the environment and its resources the study recommended the use of stochastic models pinto et al 46 also investigated the negative effect of climate change on the delivery of utilities such as water it emphasized the recurrent scarcity of water as one of the many consequences of climate change on the environment this problem is fueled by factors such as inadequate infrastructure and the fact that resources are contaminated and over exploited the study further mentioned that an adequate supply of water will depend on the level of readiness with regards to important aspects such as demand for water it s pricing cost of the utility as well as the availability of the resource they showed that water supply tariffs must be reduced between 10 and 44 percent for lower consumers and raised between 3 and 106 percent for higher consumers in line with the availability of the water resource while our study is unable to control for the cost of using water due to data availability highlighting the importance of water use pricing and financial sustainability provides key insights on the role of price and water use 3 methodology and data 3 1 conceptual framework conceptually this study builds on the integrated social and economic household water model by jorgensen et al 47 to include the current covid 19 crisis and handwashing behaviours previous studies suggest that demographics socioeconomic factors and household characteristics and composition which include household size land area location income appliances and the presence of pool facilities influence the consumption levels of water 48 50 another major determinant of water consumption is pricing renwick and archibald 50 suggest that low income households are more likely than higher income households to respond to price increments similarly kenney et al 51 show that price is an essential driver of residential water demand and additionally identify restrictions and climate weather as contributing factors of water consumption past water use habits institutional and interpersonal trust personal characteristics such as social norms behavioural control attitudes and perceived risk of shortages can equally affect water use 52 57 jorgensen et al 47 in their integrated framework discuss these factors based on the empirical model of corral verdugo et al 58 in fig 2 we modify the integrated framework of jorgensen et al 47 to reflect handwashing behaviours and individuals level of concern about covid 19 we hypothesize that an individual s level of concern about covid 19 will positively impact handwashing thereby increasing water use also based on the theory of planned behaviour social norms attitudes and perceived behavioural controls may further influence the perceptions and level of concern about covid 19 which will affect the intention to engage in handwashing however these underlying behaviours will depend on exogenous factors including the scarcity or availability of water given that sub saharan africa is not a water sufficient region it is likely that the ongoing handwashing campaigns across countries due to the covid 19 pandemic may be impacted by insufficient access to clean water resources our proposed framework explicitly accounts for water scarcity as depicted in fig 2 3 2 empirical estimation based on the reviewed literature and the conceptual framework discussed we model the frequency of handwashing as a function of the level of concern about covid 19 socioeconomic and demographic factors and other control variables our outcome variable that is frequency per day of handwashing under running water with soap for 20 s is ordinal in nature that is 0 times 1 2 times 3 5 times and more than 5 times the empirical model is specified in equation 1 1 y i k j t β 0 β 1 c o v i d c o n c e r n i k j t x i k j t β μ k j η j γ t ε i k j t where the subscripts i k j a n d t represent the observation for each individual community administrative unit country and survey wave respectively the outcome variable y is a latent variable ranging from 0 to and c o v i d c o n c e r n is a variable capturing the individual s level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on a scale of 1 5 with 1 being not concerned and 5 being very concerned the individual is asked to indicate their level of concern about the spread of covid 19 in their respective country the vector x i represents socioeconomic and demographic factors and other control variables such as gender age water source captured as whether water source is located inside house inside compound or outside compound locality that is urban rural administrative unit fixed effect μ k j country fixed effect η j and survey wave fixed effect γ t the random error term is captured as ε i k j t the observed response categories of frequency of handwashing are tied to the latent variable by the measurement model below 2 y i k j t 1 0 t i m e s i f y i k j t 0 2 1 2 t i m e s i f 0 y i k j t 2 3 3 5 t i m e s i f 2 y i k j t 5 4 5 p l u s t i m e s i f 5 y i k j t from the expression above the observed category y i k j t changes value when the latent variable y crosses a threshold given the nature of the outcome variable we estimate the empirical model using an extended ordered probit technique the level of concern about covid 19 spread is probably endogenous and this may bias our estimate if not accounted for to resolve this potential problem we applied the principal component analysis pca to generate a composite index from the individual s sources of information regarding covid 19 that is newspapers tv radio social media friends family government messages and other and this serves as an instrument for the level of concern about covid 19 based on the pca one component had eigen value strictly greater than one see table a1 in the appendix and it explained about 30 of the variation in the indicators of sources of information regarding covid 19 the oblique rotation of pc loadings in table a2 in the appendix shows that the component consists of the following information sources friends family government media newspapers social media and radio this component is used as instrument for level of concern about covid 19 consequently we estimate an extended ordered probit model with an endogenous covariate 2 2 we used the eoprobit command in stata which uses an instrument for the endogenous covariate that is level of concern about covid 19 in our case the source of information regarding covid 19 is likely to affect an individual s knowledge about covid 19 hence influencing his her concern about the spread of the virus this implies that the sources of information about covid 19 are important factors affecting an individual s level of concern about covid 19 thus the relevance assumption is satisfied also our instrument is likely to satisfy the exclusion restriction assumption since the source of information regarding covid 19 can only affect the frequency of handwashing if one is concerned about the spread of covid 19 and therefore adheres to the safety protocols such as washing of hands under running water with soap for at least 20 s to prevent infection thus our composite indexes obtained from the sources of information are correlated with the level of concern about covid 19 but uncorrelated with the frequency of handwashing our formal test as shown in section 4 results and discussion and table a3 in appendix proves the validity of the instrument from existing data from the who the distribution of covid 19 infection and fatalities have some demographic dimensions as a result our study considers subsample analysis across gender and age groups moreover access to running water which is an important element for frequent handwashing differs across rural and urban areas hence subsample analysis focusing on these areas is relevant we further examine the heterogenous effects of concerns about covid 19 spread on the frequency of handwash across various water sources that is whether water is sourced from inside house inside compound or outside compound as covid 19 responses and access to running water vary across countries we expect the effect of the level of concern about covid 19 on the frequency of handwashing to be heterogeneous thus in addition to the pooled analysis we provide country specific analysis of the issue income level of individuals or households has the potential of affecting the individual s access to water however our dataset does not contain income levels which makes it impossible for the authors to undertake income level analysis that notwithstanding we consider two variables from our dataset which potentially could enable us learn about the economic status of individuals these variables are i food worries due to lack of money or other resources and ii individual s concerns about economic impact of covid 19 thus as food worries in this case is linked to lack of money or other resources we deduce that those who are not worried about food relatively have higher economic status than those who are worried similarly those who are not concerned about the economic impact of covid 19 could be said to be economically financially stable or comfortable relative to those who are very concerned about the economic impact of the virus based on these two variables we further investigate the heterogenous effect of concerns about local spread of covid 19 on the frequency of handwash across the following groups a food worries versus no food worries and b concerned about economic impact versus not concerned about economic impact of covid 19 the standard errors in our estimations are clustered at the primary administrative unit to account for possible correlation in the residual of the frequency of handwashing among individuals within the same community by clustering the standard errors at the community level we adjust the standard errors for inference following chiwona karltun et al 59 based on their covid 19 study access to water and water pricing may be similar for individuals living in the same community however our dataset does not have information on these and other relevant factors which may affect the frequency of handwashing and could correlate among individuals by controlling for primary administrative units community level fixed effect we are able to account for water supply and water prices which are normally homogeneous at community level 3 3 data and sampling design the data for this study is based on an open access survey designed and collected by geopoll 3 3 geopoll dataset can be accessed from https data humdata org dataset covid 19 impacts africa the survey instrument can also be obtained from the same website the dataset for both waves was directly requested from geopoll two rounds of the survey were administered through sms and mobile web the first round occurred between april 2nd and april 9th 2020 and the second round from april 24th to may 8th 2020 the data comprises of 12 sub saharan african countries benin the democratic republic of congo ghana ivory coast nigeria rwanda south africa kenya mozambique zambia t country and u country 4 4 geopoll insists on making t country and u country anonymous this is because the authorities from these countries did not give geopoll permission to carryout country level analysis based on data from these countries interested readers can contact the authors for the identification of these countries the second round ran in all countries except for t country and u country for the first round a total sample of 4 788 was collected across the 12 countries in africa with each country having a sample of 400 except drc which had a sample size of 388 the second round had a sample size of 3994 with 400 from each country with the exception of rwanda which had a sample size of 394 these sample sizes give a 5 margin of error and a 95 confidence interval for each round a simple random sampling technique was used by geopoll to select respondents from their database which consists of a list of mobile subscribers in each country surveyed the sample is made up of literate adults with access to mobile phones hence reaching relatively wealthier population the sample was roughly nationally representative by age gender and location the survey was administered in english french portuguese swahili and kinyarwanda depending on country table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the variables of interest for this study about 54 6 of the sample were washing their hands for 20 s more than 5 times a day prior to the survey however 4 2 did not wash their hands for 20 s during the same period among individuals who wash their hands for more than 5 times a day for at least 20 s under running water with soap kenya has the highest proportion of individuals that is 65 6 while ivory coast has the least that is 45 5 however among those who do not wash their hands under running water with soap for at least 20 s mozambique recorded the highest rate of 7 1 followed by ivory coast 6 with ghana recording the lowest rate of 1 9 about 39 4 of respondents indicated that they sourced water outside their compound 31 3 sourced water from inside their house and about 29 3 sourced water from inside their compound 5 5 it should be noted that the question on sources of water was only asked in the first wave of the survey also the questionnaire in south africa did not include questions on water sources in both waves since not all respondents in the first wave responded in the second wave and new respondents were included in the second wave we restrict the descriptive statistics for water sources on the data from the first wave from table 1 south africa is the country with the highest access to basic drinking water with a rate of 93 9 followed by ghana with a rate of 85 8 the country with the least rate of access to basic drinking water is democratic republic of congo 46 who unicef defines basic drinking water services to comprise of drinking water from an improved source provided collection time is not more than 30 min for a round trip these improved water sources according to who unicef are piped water boreholes or tube wells protected dug wells protected springs and packaged or delivered water 6 6 world development indicators https databank worldbank org source world development indicators in the case of access to handwashing facility with soap and water the countries have rates less than 50 rwanda has the least rate of access to handwashing facility with soap and water with a rate of 4 6 according to the world bank s world development indicators handwashing facilities may be fixed or mobile and include a sink with tap water buckets with taps tippy taps and jugs or basins designated for handwashing and soap includes bar soap liquid soap powder detergent and soapy water but does not include ash soil sand or other handwashing agents thus the who unicef defines a basic handwashing facility as a device to contain transport or regulate the flow of water to facilitate handwashing with soap and water in the household 7 7 world development indicators https databank worldbank org source world development indicators generally the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 is relatively high with an average score of about 4 26 the country with the highest score of concern about the local spread of covid 19 during the periods of the survey is south africa with a score of 4 59 followed by ghana with a score of 4 57 however during the same period democratic republic of congo scored the lowest rate on concern about the local spread of covid 19 having a score of 3 35 the sample comprises of about 45 females and 67 of the total sample live in urban areas the age of respondents ranges from 18 to 91 years with an average age of about 31 years the majority of individuals that is 71 are less than 35 years and only 1 4 of the sample are aged 60 years and above 4 results and discussions in table 2 we estimate ordered probit models with and without an endogenous covariate in each case we estimate the model with and without country fixed effect however we controlled for survey wave and primary administrative unit fixed effects in all the models in columns 3 and 6 of table 2 we controlled for individual s source of water this results to a drop in the number of observation from 8 782 to 6 816 due to the fact that the question on sources of water was only asked in the first wave of the survey and not all respondents were in both waves also the questionnaire for south africa did not include questions on water sources in both waves thus the number of observation of 6 816 comprises of 4 388 respondents from the first wave and 2 428 of respondents from the first wave who also responded in the second wave as stated earlier the level of concern about covid 19 is treated as endogenous and we use the derived composite index based on the individual s sources of information as an instrument from the extended ordered probit model with endogenous covariate the composite index that is comp1 which serve as instrumental variable for the level of concern about covid 19 significantly explain the endogenous variable see table a3 in the appendix this satisfies the relevance assumption in addition there exists a significant correlation between the error term of the structural model that is handwashing model and the error term of the model of the level of concern about covid 19 this indicates that the variable representing the level of concern about covid 19 is indeed an endogenous covariate and as we account for the endogeneity our estimate for the level of concern about covid 19 approaches its true estimate furthermore the cragg donald f statistics and the hansen j statistics for overidentification show that our instrument is valid columns 1 to 3 of table 2 do not address the problem of endogeneity associated with the level of concern about covid 19 whereas columns 4 to 6 do from all the models the frequency of handwashing is significantly explained by age level of concern about covid 19 gender and source of water in models in columns 3 and 6 our models of interest are column 5 and 6 which accounts for primary administrative unit country and wave fixed effects and also the endogeneity of the level of concern about covid 19 the results show that the frequency of handwashing increases with the level of concern about covid 19 that is as the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 increases individuals tend to increase the number of times they wash their hands under running water for at least 20 s as prescribed by who as a way of reducing infection this corroborates the assertion by borghi guinness curtis 15 and mackert liang champlin 16 that handwashing is used to prevent the spread of infections and diseases the results also support the theory of planned behaviour which suggests that intention influenced by attitudes subjective norms and perceived behavioural controls is a significant driver of behaviour which in our case is handwashing 26 moreover the results are consistent with those of curtis et al 30 who based on a review of eleven countries with six from africa found that education and fear during occasional outbreaks of epidemics like cholera encourage handwashing furthermore the findings corroborate that of shook et al 35 who relate individual s germ aversion and pathogen disgust sensitivity that is concern for covid 19 to willingness to engage in disease prevention behaviours also thorpe et al 39 stipulate that handwashing behaviour of individuals is associated with individuals health anxiety and their compulsion levels to wash their hands table 3 presents the marginal effect based on our estimation it shows the marginal change in the probability of the outcome that is frequency of handwashing 0 times 1 2 times 3 5 times and more than 5 times resulting from marginal change of each covariate we find that a marginal increase in the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 decreases the probability of individuals not washing their hands with soap under running water for 20 s it also decreases the probability of individuals washing their hands 1 2 times and 3 5 times however it increases the probability of they washing their hands more than 5 times due to the concern about the spread of covid 19 the probability of frequency of handwashing 0 times 1 2 times 3 5 times and more than 5 times changes on the order of 0 007 0 008 0 014 0 011 0 010 and 0 033 0 031 respectively with a marginal increase in level of concern about the spread of covid 19 it should be noted that across all categories of frequency of handwashing the average marginal effects must sum to zero this is because any increase in the probability of one category must be offset by a decrease in another category from the descriptive statistics in table 1 it should be recalled that the proportion of individuals washing their hands more than 5 times is relatively more than the other groups hence the marginal change for washing hands for more than 5 times is expected to be relatively higher this explains the negative marginal effect for those not washing their hands washing hands for 1 2 times and 3 5 times in the case of age we find a non linear relationship between age and the frequency of handwashing see table 2 thus the frequency of handwashing increases with age and later reduces after a certain threshold that is about 52 years based on the model with all the sample it should be noted that this quadratic relationship is between age and frequency of handwashing and concern about local spread of covid 19 has no bearing on this relationship the marginal effect evaluated at the sample mean suggests that a marginal increase in age decreases the probability of not washing hands and of washing hands 1 2 times and 3 5 times but increases the probability of handwashing more than 5 times see table 3 in the case of gender the results show a significant difference between females and males in the frequency of handwashing females wash their hands relatively more frequently than males see table 2 from the marginal effect estimation in table 3 a change from male to female decreases the probability of not washing hands or washing hands 1 2 times and 3 5 times but increases the probability of handwashing more than 5 times in most developing countries women and girls are responsible for collecting water and are the main users and managers of water as they are mainly responsible for cooking laundry and other household chores like fetching water 60 moreover women are responsible for enforcing hygienic practices in home environments this may explain why females frequently wash their hands relative to males our results show a statistically significant effect of source of water on frequency of handwash from table 2 individuals who source water from outside their compound are less likely to wash this hands under running water with soap for at least 20 s relative to those who source water from inside their compound the marginal effect from table 3 shows that an individual changing his her water source from inside compound to outside compound increases the probability of not washing hands or washing hands 1 2 times and 3 5 times but decreases the probability of handwashing more than 5 times similar result is found when an individual changes his her water source from inside house to outside compound however the marginal effect is relatively higher in this case 4 1 heterogeneous effect of level of concern about covid 19 on frequency of handwashing covid 19 infections and fatalities have demographic dimensions varying across gender and age groups as a result we estimate the model for different gender and age groups and also based on locality that is urban rural source of water and economic status from table 4 and table 5 we find a significant effect of level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on the frequency of handwashing across all categories except those sourcing water from inside their house with variability in the magnitude of the effects for gender we observed this effect is higher for females relative to males however there is no statiscally significent different between effect for males and females as shown by the hausman s test there is therefore more potential for both males and females to increase their hand washing due to covid 19 concerns the age group analysis shows that the effect of the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on the frequency of handwashing increases with higher age cohort thus as those in older age group tend to be more concern about the local spread of covid 19 they are likely to follow the preventive protocol of handwashing because old age is associated with the severity and mortality of patients with covid 19 61 and most older individuals have underlying health conditions especially in sub saharan africa they tend to be more concerned about the spread of the virus this is observed from our data given their relatively high risk level it is reassuring to see that older individuals tend to adhere more to the protocols prescribed by health authorities in preventing infections from covid 19 hence washing their hands more frequently with soap under running water for at least 20 s although the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 increases the frequency of handwashing in both rural and urban areas surprisingly the effect is relatively higher in rural areas this could be due to several reasons first the frequent washing of hands may be seen as a critical preventive measure for covid 19 in rural areas where they mostly either lack or have deficient health infrastructure currently most treatment centres in sub saharan africa are located in urban areas second the poor economic status of most rural residents could make it more challenging if not impossible to acquire protective equipment such as hand sanitisers face masks and personal protective equipment in china a survey conducted in january 2020 revealed that about 63 3 of rural communities either could not buy face masks or had difficulty in buying face masks 62 63 the sub sample analysis based on individuals water sources shows that an increase in the concern about the local spread of covid 19 increases the probability of handwashing in the case of those who sourced water from inside or outside their compound see table 5 although the effect is higher for those who source water from inside compound than for those sourcing water from outside compound we find no statistically significant difference between the two also we investigate the association between concern about local spread of covid 19 and frequency of handwashing for those who are worried or not worried about food due to lack of money or other resources our results show positive association between concern about local spread of covid 19 and frequency of handwash for both those who are worried about food due to lack of money or other resources and those who are not worried see table 5 although the effect is higher for those who are worried about food relative to those not worried the difference between the two groups is not statistically significant similarly we find significant positive correlation between concern about local spread of covid 19 and frequency of handwashing for individuals who are not concern about the economic impact of covid 19 and those who are very concerned about the economic impact the effect of concern about the local spread of covid 19 on frequency of handwashing is higher for those who are very concerned about the covid 19 than those who are not concern about economic impact albeit insignificant statistical difference between the two groups 4 2 country specific analysis given that covid 19 infection and fatality rates government response and access to water differ across countries we examined the effect of the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on the frequency of handwashing for each of the 12 sub saharan african countries in this study the results of the ordered probit estimation are shown in table 6 with the exception of democratic republic of congo nigeria mozambique t country and u country we find that frequency of handwashing with soap under running water for at least 20 s increases with an increase in the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 for all the other countries under study this suggests that individuals in these countries in an attempt to prevent infection tend to follow the prescribed protocol of frequent handwashing with soap under running water for all the countries with significant impact of level of concern of covid 19 on handwashing the marginal effect estimation in table 7 shows that an increase in the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 decreases the probability of not washing hands and washing hands 1 2 times and 3 5 times but increases the probability of handwashing more than 5 times however there is variation of the impact across countries as mentioned earlier the average marginal effects across all categories must sum to zero this is because any increase in the probability of one category must be offset by a decrease in another category from table 7 the increase in the probability of handwashing more than 5 times resulting from an increase in the level of concern about covid 19 for example ranges from 3 for benin to 6 3 for south africa 4 3 implications of our findings for water scarce environment from the results as the level of conern about covid 19 rises the likelihood for people to wash their hands multiple times increases with no sign of decline in covid 19 our first important deduction is that water usage should be increasing to sustain the practice of handwashing however there are two perennial problems with water supply in sub saharan africa that might constraint efforts to sustain the practice of handwashing they include water affordability and access in fact the united nations sustainable development goal target 6 1 aims for universal access and equitable access to safe and affordable water for everyone by 2030 this implies that sustaining efforts to promote the practice of handwashing will require actions on water cost and investment according to the united nations and water supply and sanitation collaborative council cost for water and sanitation services for households should not exceed 5 percent of their income however in sub saharan africa the cost of water takes a significant portion of household income a study by shack slum dwellers international sdi 64 compute the cost of water as a percent of household income for four cities in sub saharan africa blantyre dar es salaam tanzania harare zimbabwe and windhock namibia for piped water only the cost of municipal supply of water for six person household that consumes 50 l per person per day ranges from 11 to a theoretical 112 of household income 64 a more recent global survey in 2019 on global value of water consisting of 44 cities in africa showed a modest increase in tariff of 1 9 and average water tariff of us 1 16 m3 65 however wide disparity was noticed among cities in africa while harare zimbabwe and cape town south africa experienced 62 and 49 decline in water tariff in 2019 respectively in kigali rwanda lome togo durban south africa pretoria south africa windhock namibia johannesburg south africa and accra ghana water tariffs went up by 77 1 19 14 10 9 9 9 9 and 8 respectively in terms of highest and lowest tariff countries water price in addis ababa ethiopia was the lowest us 0 13 m3 but highest in praia cabo verde us 5 17 m3 followed by mbabane eswatini us 4 79 m3 one effective course of actiton may be for governments in africa to implement well thought through cross subsidies particularly for low income households to enable them access water to ensure that water is affordable to all some governments in africa at the peak of the pandemic have provided subsidies on water utility for example the government of ghana absorbed all water bills for all ghanaians from april 2020 to january 2021 66 for households with no home connection to water the government supplied water to their homes also the government of ivory coast paid all water bills for 1 million low income households in april and may 2019 furthermore the government of south africa during the period of the lockdown established hotline support for areas in need of water while these interventions by various governments during the pandemic were critical for long term promotion of handwashing practices which are critical for preventing future pandemics a sustainable subsidy programme that would ease the water expenditure burden of consumers is required second though we found the level of concern about covid 19 raises the likelihood of a person washing his her hands frequently limited access and the severe water scarcity in sub saharan africa could be an important constraint to sustain the practice especially among very vulnerable groups such as the old rural populations and women as shown in table 1 an average of 67 25 of the population in these countries have access to at least basic drinking water and an average of 26 56 of the population have access to basic handwashing facilities including soap and water a simple correlation test between the marginal effect of handwashing for at least 5 times see table 7 and access to water shows a positive statistically significant value of 0 68 implying that an increase in access to water has the potential to increase the frequency of handwashing which is a preventive measure to most viral infection a key problem that makes it difficult for utilities in africa to improve coverage and access involves underinvestment in infrastructure and lack of maintenance for aging infrastructure improving the financial stance of the utilities may prove critical to improve water coverage however in africa a recent world bank report 67 indicate that the link between enhanced financial performance and water coverage is only strong for some group of utilities but when it comes to smaller utilities it is very weak which means such utilities may have to depend on external funds to promote coverage in this regard providing government support especially to small utilities in low income countries could be critical to improving water coverage running a successful subsidy programme to reduce price burden and promote investment in water infrastructure could go a long way to help improve affordability and access however scarcity in water could be naturally imposed poor rains could create acute water supply shortages with obvious implications for water price inflation this implies that in addition having a sustainable subsidy programme to promote afforability and access governments in africa should run parallel programmes to promote water use efficiency in the region for example although south africa has relatively higher access to basic drinking water about 94 and handwashing facilities that is 44 the country has been faced with a water crisis in the recent past 2017 2018 the country resorted to water saving management campaigns as a strategy to manage the water crisis of 2017 2018 68 adopting such a tripartite programme could help sustain the efforts of handwashing with obvious future implications for managing similar pandemics in the future and other communicable diseases such as cholera 5 conclusion this study uses a unique dataset from 12 sub saharan african countries to investigate the effect of the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on the frequency of handwashing with soap under running water for a minimum of 20 s because the infection and fatality rates of covid 19 have demographic dimensions we also considered gender and age group locality and various water sources analysis we found that the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 significantly increases the frequency of handwashing more than 5 times a day we observed that on a normal day females typically wash their hands more frequently than males however of the concern about the spread of covid 19 no statistically significant difference between females and males was found the effect of the level of concern about the spread of covid 19 on frequency of handwashing is high for older individuals this could be attributed to the fact that fatalities caused by covid 19 are mostly centered in older age groups who are most likely to suffer from underlying medical conditions the country specific analysis shows a significant effect of concern about the spread of covid 19 on frequency of handwashing for seven out of the twelve countries covid 19 concerns make individuals in these countries more likely to wash their hands with soap under running water for a minimum of 20 s more than 5 times a day with a probability ranging from 3 for benin to 6 3 for south africa from the above we expect that the continuous rise in cases of covid 19 will increase concerns among people and this is projected to impact the number of times people wash their hands with consequences on water usage however already there are concerns about water shortage in africa a situation which suggests that africa countries improve the reliability of water supply by expanding infrastructure and promoting water use efficiency among its citizenry thus without proper water use management and investment in water infrastructure the act of frequent handwashing might be constraint and cause the spread of the virus to increase the situation in sub saharan africa calls for urgent and effective water management and supply strategies in the region the current rate of water consumption suggests that water resource may be a scarce commodity in the future if relevant authorities fail to take action efforts must gear towards protecting the resource and popularizing its prudent use this will ensure an appropriate attitude from users and management and lead to the conservation of the resource in addition proper skills in managing water systems finances will be important for prudent use of generated revenues conducting frequent maintenance of the system and productivity improvement declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

extended ordered probit technique with an endogenous covariate where level of concern about covid 19 is endogenous the principal component comp1 derived from the sources of information about covid 19 is used as an instrument for the variable representing level of concern about covid 19 we controlled for administrative unit country and wave fixed effect in the model standard errors are clustered at
