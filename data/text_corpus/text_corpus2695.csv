ability to remove mps based on the particle size of mps the cloth filter can be used as an additional unit operation after a conventional rapid sand filter or as surface filtration in the ultrafiltration process the cloth filter media was made by 194 μm 115 μm and 57 5 μm polyester the artificial mps size varied from 210 to 420 μm and 420 μm a 194 μm filter pore could remove 41 5 of mps which particle size 420 μm while 115 μm and 57 5 μm filters pore could remove 55 5 and 83 7 respectively a 194 μm filter pore could remove 34 of mps which particle size range of 210 420 μm while 115 μm and 57 5 μm filters pore could remove 52 85 and 85 3 respectively based on tensile strength and elongation the 194 μm filters pore were better than both 115 μm and 57 5 μm filter pores however quality tensile strength and elongation had no impact on mps removal due to its large pore size filters which pore sizes 194 μm and 115 μm showed that the mps size had a significant effect on removal p 0 05 on which also be shown by regression coefficient of 34 7 and 15 8 however for 57 5 μm pore filter the mps size did not affect mps removal p value 0 05 on which also be shown by a low regression coefficient of 1 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics removal particle size polymer filter media surface filter 1 introduction plastic production had increased from 0 5 million tons per year in 1950 to 335 million tons in 2016 1 this trend is associated with the lack of public awareness regarding the negative impacts of plastic waste plastics wastes may create new and prolonged problems in the environment one pressing concern is the microplastics mps initially mps were defined as the deformation of plastic material due to environmental conditions 2 the terminology developed in 2004 was then adopted by the marine debris program steering committee of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa as a plastic with a size smaller than 5 mm 3 microplastics formed from manufactured plastics production are called primary mps secondary mps include fibres or fragments resulting from the breakdown of larger plastics items 4 recent studies show that mps were identified in several regions 5 such as in asia europe north america and antarctica 6 11 concerns on mps are associated with its bioaccumulation potential into organisms microplastics can be swallowed by various organisms from plankton and fish to birds and even mammals which then accumulates through the food chain occurrence of mps in living things such as zooplankton annelids echinoderms fish had been studied extensively 12 15 in addition mps contain many additional chemicals and can absorb organic substances from the surrounding environment those substances can move from one organism through digestion microplastics act as a vector for other organic pollutants and causes mps to be a source of exposure for living things 16 currently there were around 50 studies that provide mps concentration data on drinking water or freshwater sources namely surface water and groundwater and wastewater 17 freshwater bodies are the main source of drinking water for human consumption and are therefore suspected of being a potential source of mps contamination of humans 18 several raw water samples of selected drinking water treatment plants dwtp had been investigated and microplastics presence was confirmed by pivokonsky et al 18 and mintenig et al 19 where the number of microplastics reaches up to 4000 items per liter microplastics has also been reported presence in lakes rivers and dams globally 10 20 24 even found in remote areas although in small numbers 25 27 thus it can be said that water treatment plants must face the presence of new microplastics pollutant in raw water sources 28 microplastic varies in size shape color composition density and other properties one thing that becomes very important is the size of the mps because it will determine the distribution or spread to the environment therefore it is necessary to investigate mps removal treatment as an alternative solution to prevent the spread of mps to the environment and affecting human health in this study a cloth filter was used as a filtering medium for mps removal because the process was simple the type of cloth filter used was polyester with pore size 57 5 μm 115 μm 194 μm cloth filter applies the principle of surface filtration surface filtration is the most commonly used type of filtration in surface filtration porous surfaces retain particles based on particle size 29 berk 29 used polyester fabric to support a layer of membrane filters zahid and el shafai 30 study stated that using textile materials as a filtration medium in membrane bioreactors mbr can reduce the cost of manufacturing and operating membrane bioreactors because of their simple operation and cleaning and no need for chemical cleaning to recover flux the use of cloth media in mbr can reduce the capital and operational costs of the reactor this finding was in line with the research conducted by liu et al 31 which stated that polyester and nylon filters had been used as filtration materials in mbr not only to reduce production and operating costs but also to remove cod chemical oxygen demand tss total suspended solids and tkn total kjeldahl nitrogen this research was conducted as an experiment to determine whether cloth filters can be used as filter media to remove mps particles the experiment proceeded with determining the effect of mps particle size on the efficiency of removal the characterization of mps particles in the research process used a size and color sorting system scs which effectively categorizes plastic pieces based on their size and shape the scs system can identify both the size and shape of the plastic but this study solely looked at the particle size 2 experimental details 2 1 materials this experiment used cloth filters made of polyester which pore size 57 5 μm 115 μm 194 μm the material used in this study was three cloths filter size specifically selected so that they had similar properties but differed in pore sizes identification of the filter pore size was analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su 3500 fig 1 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 artificial sample microplastics samples contain fabric fibres pet food containers polypropylene flute boards polypropylene bottle caps hdpe and bath sponges ldpe they were selected because they are bright in color which could ease visual identification plastics were then crushed and shredded using a mill flute boards bottle caps and food containers were chopped into 1 1 cm and the bath sponge was cut into 0 1 0 5 cm long then all the plastics were put into the mill the fabric was brushed by a metal brush to get the fibre the mps fragment type was represented by flute boards bottle caps and food containers whereas fibre was represented by bath sponges and fabrics the mill should be stopped for every 2 min operation to prevent heat accumulation the microplastic size was made in two variations 40mesh 420 μm and 70 mesh 210 420 μm by using a sieving analyzer to ease visual picking the lower bound of mps variation was 200 μm visualization of artificial samples can be seen in figs 2 and 3 before the main experiment the concentration of artificial samples should be determined the 112 particles l were chosen to represent the concentration of raw water in citepus river one of the tributaries in upstream citarum river the size of mps in citepus river was between 57 5 and 1000 μm three variations of weight had been tested 0 05 g 0 08 g and 0 1 g after several attempts to get a similar number of mps approximately 112 particles l then 0 08 g was chosen the procedures were 1 scale mixed microplastics to 0 05 g 0 08 g and 0 1 g then put it into a jar washed with distilled water 2 adds 1 l of distilled water and shakes the jar 3 filter the water by using whatman gf c filter paper by using a vacuum filter 4 move the filter paper into a petri dish put the sample into the oven for 105o c for 30 min 5 the filter paper is analyzed under binocular microscope optika b 383fl with 10 magnification total 100 magnification 6 the total number of mps particles which almost similar to 112 mg l then be used as the weight to make artificial samples based on the preliminary experiment then the concentration of mps of 112 particles l was equal to approximately 0 08 g l 2 2 2 microplastics visual identification samples were filtered with paper whatman gf c using a vacuum filter the filter paper was moved into a petri dish and dried using an oven at 105o c for approximately 30 min to remove water content on filter paper which was referred to in the previous study conducted by 6 the drying process of samples at 105o c has no effects on mps samples because the melting points for each type of plastics that is often found in the aquatic environment polypropylene polyethylene terephthalate polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene as described by crawford and quinn 3 are higher than 105o c the melting point of several plastic polymers as described in previous studies are polyethylene 130o c 32 hdpe and polypropylene 165o c and 136o c 33 ldpe 110o c and lldpe 126o c 34 pet 250o c and for commercial pet 265o c polyamide nylon 6 216o c pvc 240o c 35 a light binocular b 383fl series optika microscope with 10 lens magnification 100 total magnification was used to assist with identification counting and measuring the number and size of mps the steps and procedures of mps identification was referred to in the technical guidelines and provisions of crawford and quinn 3 the unit of mps observed was the number of mps per liter samples 2 2 3 analysis and characteristics of filter media the filter medium was a cloth filter made of polyester this type of filter media was chosen because it can filter the particles as surface filtration 29 31 the filter media was analyzed prior to the experiment to determine the characteristics of filter media namely pore size tensile strength and elongation test scanning electron microscopy sem was used to determine the morphology of filter media with sem data can be obtained regarding pore size so that a standard uniformity of filter structure can be determined 36 based on the imaging obtained from sem the pore size of the filter before experiments were 194 μm 115 μm 57 5 μm the test results for tensile strength and elongation were then shown in a curve to obtain the tensile strength and elongation values of the filter media used additional laboratory analysis of tensile strength and elongation for each filter size are covered in supplementary documents table 1 2 3 preliminary experiment preliminary experiments were conducted as controls on the polyester cloth filter it was suspected that the polyester fabric would also be the source of mps in the process the cloth filter was rinsed with distilled water continuously with a filtration speed of 1 5 lpm litter per minute for 96 h to see if during the experiment plastics fibres originating from the filter were presence after 96 h of operation two particles l of mps were found therefore the main research would be conducted in 72 h water samples from filter outlets were taken every 12 h 2 4 main research the cloth filter reactor contains acrylic pipe with an overall height of 28 cm and a diameter of 10 cm fig 4 the reactor used cloth filters in the mps removal process the observed parameters included the number of mps measurement of the size and removal efficiency a correlation analysis amongst parameters would be conducted experiments were carried out continuously by diverting samples from the gravity tank to cloth filter with flow rate 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 lpm the samples from the storage tank were pumped by submersible pumps to the gravity tank any overflow water from the gravity tank would be recirculating to the storage tank so that the flow to the cloth filter remained constant then the water from the gravity tank was flowed by gravity force the flow rate into the reactor was maintained during the filtration process filtration rate control was carried out by using a flow meter and control valve in the effluent each batch was last for 72 h a filtration rate check was conducted at least three times during the experiment 37 the cloth filter was rinsed three 3 times using distilled water in addition the pump flow meter and connecting hose were also rinsed with distilled water after each experiment variation to prevent cross contamination this refers to the study of long et al 38 the used cloth filter was stored in a petri dish and then closed strictly to eliminate the possibility of mps contamination from the air every 12 h the outlet samples were taken and then filtered with paper whatman gf c using a vacuum filter the filter paper was moved into a petri dish and was dried using an oven at 105o c for approximately 30 min to remove water content on the filter paper finally the filter paper with mps samples was observed using a light binocular microscope optika series b 383fl with 10 times magnifications 2 5 microplastics removal efficiency the removal efficiency was calculated from the number of mps screened and filtered in filter media efficiency values are calculated by comparing influents the number of mps entering the reactor minus effluent the number of mps coming out from the reactor divided by the influent expressed in percentage the percentage of removal can be calculated based on eq 1 1 r c in cout c in x 100 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted in this study to determine the effect of mps size on the efficiency of mps removal the data must fulfill the normality test and linearity test before proceeding to a simple regression test the normality test was carried out using the kolmogorov smirnov test with the critical area reject if the p value is 5 and the following hypothesis ho data is normally distributed h1 data is not normally distributed if each variable tested is distributed normally then a simple regression test was performed 3 result and discussion 3 1 characteristic and morphology of filter media based on research conducted by drioli and gioro 39 membranes or filter polymer with large pore size high porosity and low thickness produce high species displacement but large pore size could also mean a low value of breakthrough pressure pressure when the membrane is moistened with liquid and loses the nature of hydrophobicity it is suspected that the cloth filter will remove most mps by surface filtration mechanism after 3 three days of the filtration process it was found that the elongation process occurred in the cloth filter and the filter pores enlarged causing decrease in the effectiveness of mps removal fig 5 the filter with an initial size of 57 5 μm had a pore magnification of 0 27 0 34 the filter with pore sizes of 115 μm had an elongation of 0 03 0 14 while the filter with 194 μm pore size was elongated at 0 0015 0 03 the 194 μm filter showed the lowest percentage of elongation value this result suggests that in terms of the structure of the forming material the 194 μm filter was better than both 115 μm and 57 5 μm filters 3 2 filtration efficiency of the filters the 57 5 μm filter had the largest percentage of mps removal at 89 5 while 194 μm filter had the lowest removal rate at 25 on the 57 5 μm filter the highest removal rate occurred after the 12 h reactor operation and the lowest after the 72 h reactor operation the 115 μm filter showed the highest removal after 12 h reactor operation and the lowest removal after 48 h reactor operation meanwhile the 194 μm filter had the highest removal at flow rate 0 75 lpm after reactor was operated for 12 h and the lowest removal after 72 h of reactor operation the percentage of mps removal tends to fluctuate at each measurement hour i e at 12 24 36 48 60 and 72 h fluctuations in measurements occurred at each flow rate fig 6 shows that the biggest mps removal used a filter with a pore size of 57 5 μm at 89 5 the experiments showed that mps with particle size 420 40 mesh on average were removed 41 5 in 194 μm filters while for filters 115 μm and 57 5 μm the mps were removed by 55 5 and 83 7 respectively the 194 μm filters remove an average of 34 microplastics with a particle size range of 210 420 μm 70 mesh filters with size 115 μm and 57 5 μm could remove mps particle on average by 52 85 and 85 3 respectively microplastics removal of this study were 34 85 3 this means some of mps will not trap in cloth filter the size of microplastics has been defined as the largest part of mps most of the time the largest part length or diameter differs with both width and thickness both width and thickness are smaller size therefore mps position before passing through filter pore is also important if the mps position in width and thickness just before passing through filter it is more likely the pore filter cannot screen the mps moreover the cloth filter can start to fail the failure can be caused by one of the following 1 disintegration the cloth starts to tear or come apart at the seams perhaps because of chemical attack or wearing 2 pin holing holes appear in the cloth causing the filtrate clarity to be lower than the required level over time this hole would have grown rapidly 3 blinding the capacity drops below the required level and cleaning will no longer refresh the cloth s performance 40 despite cloth filter can remove only some part of mps but this study contributes to size information of mps that can be removed mostly by the cloth filter most study currently reported the presence of mps in drinking water however some information need further justification for example the size and type of mps should also be mentioned in the study to show which type and size which still presence in drinking water 5 17 19 size of mps affect the filtration process especially for ultrafiltration the smaller particles size the more serious of the membrane fouling 41 the concern of smaller mps 0 5 mm should be considered for water treatment process 17 18 41 43 the mechanism on how mps trap or filter during the process should also be investigated 44 concluded that mps are not likely to settle in the sedimentation process therefore counting on filtration unit or additional cloth filter for mps removal is essential cloth filter is made of polymers in a study conducted by mulder 36 there are several ways to engineer the properties of polymers so that the desired separation characteristics occur like using more than one type of polymers combined two or more types of polymers can improve the properties of polymers the combination which results in higher degrees of crossing linking polymer structures will increase dense and interlocking chain interactions also have a drastic effect on the physical properties of polymers however this study does not investigate how interactions of alkyl groups have hydrogen bonds or dipole interactions the removal of mps was expected because of the surface filtration though other mechanisms such as van der waals force and other physical processes are possible 45 it is more likely that cloth filter will consistent to screen the mps up to a point when the failures start to occur the performance of the fabrics should be predicted right from the design phase the design of a fabric is focusing on the materials selection as well as on the definition of its structural parameters so that the requirements of the end use such as for water and wastewater treatment can be fulfilled these changes in the application field of the textile structures caused a move from the aesthetic design to the total technical design where the fabric appearance and the particular properties affecting its final performance are taken into account 46 for future application in water and wastewater treatment the selection of engineered cloth or fabric should also be considered in this study a polyester cloth filter was used yarn type monofilament no liquid can flow through the yarn itself only through the pores in the woven cloth in operation a monofilament cloth may be vulnerable to chemical attack and can become brittle despite the possible failures cloth filter can be used as an option for the advanced final stage of the wastewater treatment stage the tertiary post filtration unit 12 rolling filter of pile fabric can remove mps 500 mm completely and 95 of the mps 20 500 μm 47 although the application of cloth filter to water wastewater treatment plants still requires a lot of development and further research so that no mps will escape from the water and wastewater treatment plant to human bodies and water bodies the normality test on 194 μm filter media using the kolmogorov smirnov test obtained ksz values of 0 705 and asymp sig 2 tailed of 0 703 0 05 it was concluded that the data has a normal distribution the 115 μm filter media showed the ksz values of 0 634 and asymp sig 2 tailed of 0 816 was greater than 0 05 while filter with a pore size of 57 5 μm indicated ksz values of 0 635 and asymp sig 2 tailed of 0 815 was greater than 0 05 thus both of these filters have normally distributed data regression curves and normality test histograms can be seen in figs 7 8 and 9 based on data analysis using spss software the regression equation was obtained for 194 μm 115 μm and 57 5 μm filter are y 48 079 0 263x y 56 420 0 116x y 78 981 0 012x respectively the regression equation above shows that on filter media with pore size 194 μm and 115 μm shows that if the value of variable x mps size increases then the value of variable y microplastics removal will decrease by 0 263 and 0 116 respectively if the value of x increases then the value of y will decrease and vice versa the filter media with pore size of 57 5 μm shows different condition the increase in variable x mps size is directly proportional to the increase in variable y microplastics removal in this case if the value of x increases 1 unit then the value of y will increase by 0 012 table 2 shows the results of a simple regression test between mps size and mps removal the mps size did affect the filter media performance in 194 μm and 115 μm filter media p value 0 05 however this relationship was not the case in filter media with a pore size of 57 5 μm p value 0 05 regression coefficients on 194 μm 115 μm and 57 5 μm filters were 34 7 15 8 and 1 respectively which also show the degree of influence of mps size to performance of the filter while the rest are influenced by other variables excluded in the model based on the regression coefficient value indicates that the smaller the filter pore size the effect of mps size on the performance of filter media was insignificant this can occur due to small pore size so that the occurrence of elongation or pore magnification did not significantly affect the performance of the reactor to remove mps media filters with small pore size can remove mps well in predetermined range of mps particles size 4 conclusions microplastics removal range for artificial particles size of 70 mesh 210 420 μm for 194 μm 115 μm and 57 5 μm filter were 29 8 53 44 4 62 4 62 2 89 5 respectively while mps with particles size of 40 mesh 420 μm were 25 40 8 42 54 2 60 18 87 7 respectively besides the filter pore size tensile strength and elongation of filter materials should also be considered when selecting cloth filters to remove mps both of these factors determined the efficiency of filter removal the 194 μm filter showed the lowest percentage of elongation value and showed no effect on the removal efficiency because of the large pore size microplastics size had a significant effect on microplastics removal on the 194 μm and 115 μm filters while on 57 5 μm filter microplastics size did not affect mps removal in conclusion the higher pore the higher the filter quality based on tensile strength and elongation however quality does not affect the removal of mps due to its large pore size declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

the imaging obtained from sem the pore size of the filter before experiments were 194 μm 115 μm 57 5 μm the test results for tensile strength and elongation were then shown in a curve to obtain the tensile strength and elongation values of the filter media used additional laboratory analysis of tensile strength and elongation for each filter size are covered in supplementary documents table 1 2 3 preliminary experiment preliminary experiments were conducted as controls on the polyester cloth filter it was suspected that the polyester fabric would also be the source of mps in the process the cloth filter was rinsed with distilled water continuously with a filtration speed of 1 5 lpm litter per minute for 96 h to see if during the experiment plastics fibres originating from the filter were presence after 96 h of operation two particles l of mps were found therefore the main research would be conducted in 72 h water samples from filter outlets were taken every 12 h 2 4 main research the cloth filter reactor contains acrylic pipe with an overall height of 28 cm and a diameter of 10 cm fig 4 the reactor used cloth filters in the mps removal process the observed parameters included the number of mps measurement of the size and removal efficiency a correlation analysis amongst parameters would be conducted experiments were carried out continuously by diverting samples from the gravity tank to cloth filter with flow rate 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 lpm the samples from the storage tank were pumped by submersible pumps to the gravity tank any overflow water from the gravity tank would be recirculating to the storage tank so that the flow to the cloth filter remained constant then the water from the gravity tank was flowed by gravity force the flow rate into the reactor was maintained during the filtration process filtration rate control was carried out by using a flow meter and control valve in the effluent each batch was last for 72 h a filtration rate check was conducted at least three times during the experiment 37 the cloth filter was rinsed three 3 times using distilled water in addition the pump flow meter and connecting hose were also rinsed with distilled water after each experiment variation to prevent cross contamination this refers to the study of long et al 38 the used cloth filter was stored in a petri dish and then closed strictly to eliminate the possibility of mps contamination from the air every 12 h the outlet samples were taken and then filtered with paper whatman gf c using a vacuum filter the filter paper was moved into a petri dish and was dried using an oven at 105o c for approximately 30 min to remove water content on the filter paper finally the filter paper with mps samples was observed using a light binocular microscope optika series b 383fl with 10 times magnifications 2 5 microplastics removal efficiency the removal efficiency was calculated from the number of mps screened and filtered in filter media efficiency values are calculated by comparing influents the number of mps entering the reactor minus effluent the number of mps coming out from the reactor divided by the influent expressed in percentage the percentage of removal can be calculated based on eq 1 1 r c in cout c in x 100 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analyses were conducted in this study to determine the effect of mps size on the efficiency of mps removal the data must fulfill the normality test and linearity test before proceeding to a simple regression test the normality test was carried out using the kolmogorov smirnov test with the critical area reject if the p value is 5 and the following hypothesis ho data is normally distributed h1 data is not normally distributed if each variable tested is distributed normally then a simple regression test was performed 3 result and discussion 3 1 characteristic and morphology of filter media based on research conducted by drioli and gioro 39 membranes or filter polymer with large pore size high porosity and low thickness produce high species displacement but large pore size could also mean a low value of breakthrough pressure pressure when the membrane is moistened with liquid and loses the nature of hydrophobicity it is suspected that the cloth filter will remove most mps by surface filtration mechanism after 3 three days of the filtration process it was found that the elongation process occurred in the cloth filter and the filter pores enlarged causing decrease in the effectiveness of mps removal fig 5 the filter with an initial size of 57 5 μm had a pore magnification of 0 27 0 34 the filter with pore sizes of 115 μm had an elongation of 0 03 0 14 while the filter with 194 μm pore size was elongated at 0 0015 0 03 the 194 μm filter showed the lowest percentage of elongation value this result suggests that in terms of the structure of the forming material the 194 μm filter was better than both 115 μm and 57 5 μm filters 3 2 filtration efficiency of the filters the 57 5 μm filter had the largest percentage of mps removal at 89 5 while 194 μm filter had the lowest removal rate at 25 on the 57 5 μm filter the highest removal rate occurred after the 12 h reactor operation and the lowest after the 72 h reactor operation the 115 μm filter showed the highest removal after 12 h reactor operation and the lowest removal after 48 h reactor operation meanwhile the 194 μm filter had the highest removal at flow rate 0 75 lpm after reactor was operated for 12 h and the lowest removal after 72 h of reactor operation the percentage of mps removal tends to fluctuate at each measurement hour i e at 12 24 36 48 60 and 72 h fluctuations in measurements occurred at each flow rate fig 6 shows that the biggest mps removal used a filter with a pore size of 57 5 μm at 89 5 the experiments showed that mps with particle size 420 40 mesh on average were removed 41 5 in 194 μm filters while for filters 115 μm and 57 5 μm the mps were removed by 55 5 and 83 7 respectively the 194 μm filters remove an average of 34 microplastics with a particle size range of 210 420 μm 70 mesh filters with size 115 μm and 57 5 μm could remove mps particle on average by 52 85 and 85 3 respectively microplastics removal of this study were 34 85 3 this means some of mps will not trap in cloth filter the size of microplastics has been defined as the largest part of mps most of the time the largest part length or diameter differs with both width and thickness both width and thickness are smaller size therefore mps position before passing through filter pore is also important if the mps position in width and thickness just before passing through filter it is more likely the pore filter cannot screen the mps moreover the cloth filter can start to fail the failure can be caused by one of the following 1 disintegration the cloth starts to tear or come apart at the seams perhaps because of chemical attack or wearing 2 pin holing holes appear in the cloth causing the filtrate clarity to be lower than the required level over time this hole would have grown rapidly 3 blinding the capacity drops below the required level and cleaning will no longer refresh the cloth s performance 40 despite cloth filter can remove only some part of mps but this study contributes to size information of mps that can be removed mostly by the cloth filter most study currently reported the presence of mps in drinking water however some information need further justification for example the size and type of mps should also be mentioned in the study to show which type and size which still presence in drinking water 5 17 19 size of mps affect the filtration process especially for ultrafiltration the smaller particles size the more serious of the membrane fouling 41 the concern of smaller mps 0 5 mm should be considered for water treatment process 17 18 41 43 the mechanism on how mps trap or filter during the process should also be investigated 44 concluded that mps are not likely to settle in the sedimentation process therefore counting on filtration unit or additional cloth filter for mps removal is essential cloth filter is made of polymers in a study conducted by mulder 36 there are several ways to engineer the properties of polymers so that the desired separation characteristics occur like using more than one type of polymers combined two or more types of polymers can improve the properties of polymers the combination which results in higher degrees of crossing linking polymer structures will increase dense and interlocking chain interactions also have a drastic effect on the physical properties of polymers however this study does not investigate how interactions of alkyl groups have hydrogen bonds or dipole interactions the removal of mps was expected because of the surface filtration though other mechanisms such as van der waals force and other physical processes are possible 45 it is more likely that cloth filter will consistent to screen the mps up to a point when the failures start to occur the performance of the fabrics should be predicted right from the design phase the design of a fabric is focusing on the materials selection as well as on the definition of its structural parameters so that the requirements of the end use such as for water and wastewater treatment can be fulfilled these changes in the application field of the textile structures caused a move from the aesthetic design to the total technical design where the fabric appearance and the particular properties affecting its final performance are taken into account 46 for future application in water and wastewater treatment the selection of engineered cloth or fabric should also be considered in this study a polyester cloth filter was used yarn type monofilament no liquid can flow through the yarn itself only through the pores in the woven cloth in operation a monofilament cloth may be vulnerable to chemical attack and can become brittle despite the possible failures cloth filter can be used as an option for the advanced final stage of the wastewater treatment stage the tertiary post filtration unit 12 rolling filter of pile fabric can remove mps 500 mm completely and 95 of the mps 20 500 μm 47 although the application of cloth filter to water wastewater treatment plants still requires a lot of development and further research so that no mps will escape from the water and wastewater treatment plant to human bodies and water bodies the normality test on 194 μm filter media using the kolmogorov smirnov test obtained ksz values of 0 705 and asymp sig 2 tailed of 0 703 0 05 it was concluded that the data has a normal distribution the 115 μm filter media showed the ksz values of 0 634 and asymp sig 2 tailed of 0 816 was greater than 0 05 while filter with a pore size of 57 5 μm indicated ksz values of 0 635 and asymp sig 2 tailed of 0 815 was greater than 0 05 thus both of these filters have normally distributed data regression curves and normality test histograms can be seen in figs 7 8 and 9 based on data analysis using spss software the regression equation was obtained for 194 μm 115 μm and 57 5 μm filter are y 48 079 0 263x y 56 420 0 116x y 78 981 0 012x respectively the regression equation above shows that on filter media with pore size 194 μm and 115 μm shows that if the value of variable x mps size increases then the value of variable y microplastics removal will decrease by 0 263 and 0 116 respectively if the value of x increases then the value of y will decrease and vice versa the filter media with pore size of 57 5 μm shows different condition the increase in variable x mps size is directly proportional to the increase in variable y microplastics removal in this case if the value of x increases 1 unit then the value of y will increase by 0 012 table 2 shows the results of a simple regression test between mps size and mps removal the mps size did affect the filter media performance in 194 μm and 115 μm filter media p value 0 05 however this relationship was not the case in filter media with a pore size of 57 5 μm p value 0 05 regression coefficients on 194 μm 115 μm and 57 5 μm filters were 34 7 15 8 and 1 respectively which also show the degree of influence of mps size to performance of the filter while the rest are influenced by other variables excluded in the model based on the regression coefficient value indicates that the smaller the filter pore size the effect of mps size on the performance of filter media was insignificant this can occur due to small pore size so that the occurrence of elongation or pore magnification did not significantly affect the performance of the reactor to remove mps media filters with small pore size can remove mps well in predetermined range of mps particles size 4 conclusions microplastics removal range for artificial particles size of 70 mesh 210 420 μm for 194 μm 115 μm and 57 5 μm filter were 29 8 53 44 4 62 4 62 2 89 5 respectively while mps with particles size of 40 mesh 420 μm were 25 40 8 42 54 2 60 18 87 7 respectively besides the filter pore size tensile strength and elongation of filter materials should also be considered when selecting cloth filters to remove mps both of these factors determined the efficiency of filter removal the 194 μm filter showed the lowest percentage of elongation value and showed no effect on the removal efficiency because of the large pore size microplastics size had a significant effect on microplastics removal on the 194 μm and 115 μm filters while on 57 5 μm filter microplastics size did not affect mps removal in conclusion the higher pore the higher the filter quality based on tensile strength and elongation however quality does not affect the removal of mps due to its large pore size declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

13476,this study predicts the possible occurrence of trihalomethanes thms in water supply of chattrogram city in bangladesh and life time cancer risk from multi pathway intakes of the trihalomethanes thms to the city dwellers a total of 11 water samples were collected from the distribution network of the city and few water quality parameters were analyzed in the study three empirical models developed by amy et al 1998 rathbun 1996 and malcolm pirnie 1993 were used to estimate the level of thms from measured water quality data and were denoted as model1 model2 and model3 respectively in the study lifetime cancer risk was estimated using predicted chronic daily intakes cdi of thms species for different exposure routes ingestion inhalation and dermal the total concentrations of thms ranged between 20 and 440 μg l 95 215 μg l and 162 249 μg l were predicted by model1 model2 and model3 respectively an average lifetime cancer risk was predicted as 1 4 10 4 1 1 10 4 and 2 9 10 4 for oral inhalation and dermal exposure respectively from the water supply of the city percent contribution to total lifetime cancer risk were predicted as 50 40 and10 for oral ingestion inhalation and dermal absorption respectively the study revealed that lifetime cancer risk values were higher than minimum risk level set by united states environmental protection agency the findings of possible occurrence of thms in the water supply and associated cancer risk might be beneficial as baseline data for further investigation and help the decision makers regarding the formulation of standards and legislations of thms keywords disinfection drinking water disinfection by products model cancer risk 1 introduction water disinfection has been practiced worldwide as an essential step in water treatment process to minimize the microbial pathogenic infection formation of disinfection by products dbps occurs for the chemical reaction of disinfectants and natural organic matter present in water 1 3 in municipal water supply system from treatment plant to consumer tap various classes of dbps may be formed at any point of the distribution line depending upon the availability of precursors and the disinfectant 4 5 chlorine is the most widely used disinfectants worldwide and in municipal water supply facilities residual chlorine reacts with the organic and inorganic precursors to form carcinogenic chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps 6 7 the study of dbps in water took the interest of the researchers for their carcinogenicity and adverse health effects 1 8 11 various classes of dbps compounds include trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans and haloketones hks thms compounds are the most studied and abundant group of dbps in water supply thms species include chloroform cf bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform bf the sum of these four chemical substances refers to as total trihalomethanes tthms 2 3 13 natural organic matter nom concentration level of raw water plays the critical role in the formation of dbps 13 14 different water quality parameters such as ph temperature ammonia carbonate alkalinity bromide operational conditions such as disinfectant dose contact time are identified as the important influential factors as well 1 5 12 13 14 the usepa 15 has established the threshold level of 0 08 mg l 80 ppb for total thms the current regulations in china for chloroform cf bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform bf are 60 60 100 100 μg l respectively 14 the who guidelines 100 ppb for tthms are currently adopted by many countries and regions 16 bangladesh standard for water quality parameters has set the standard 90 ppb for chloroform trichloromehane chcl3 only 17 however no drinking water quality guideline exists for total or other dbps species in the country exposure pathways of thms species for the people may be categorized into three oral ingestion inhalation and dermal absorption showering bathing washing swimming are the regular indoor activities by which people are exposed to thms through inhalation and dermal absorption 2 5 9 18 dbps in drinking water have positive association with cancer and potential adverse reproductive effects numerous studies found that dbps that have been associated with several adverse health effects from long term exposure including bladder and colorectal cancer and adverse birth outcomes 8 10 16 few studies have been investigated the relationship between chlorination of drinking water and cancer mortality through toxicological laboratory studies 19 22 a linkage between exposure to chlorinated drinking water and the development of urinary bladder cancer is detected 9 10 21 moreover kidney liver and intestinal tumorigenesis are also found to be associated with chronic ingestion of thms 22 23 to control dbps formation various pretreatment technologies are applied before chlorination in developed countries removal of precursors is the most effective way to reduce the formation of dbps 1 3 5 to ensure limited dbps formation in distribution line the water works of these countries adjust the operational parameters and influencing factors of dbp through monitoring dbps concentration level regularly 5 however there is no strategy or plans to control dbps in water treatment plants in bangladesh monitoring of thms is a time consuming and laborious work which involves complex process for sample extraction and expensive instrument 24 26 hence particular interest has been directed on development of models to estimate the formation of thm which may be an alternative of thms measurement in the field 26 27 29 adaptation of empirical models linear or log linear available in the literature can be a simplified solution to meet the primary interest in the field of thms research 28 30 a significant number of mathematical models have been developed to predict dbps in drinking water 18 21 27 30 incorporating water quality parameters as well the operational conditions of the water treatment plants in the past three decades dbps models can be roughly classified into two types first type is based on empirical relationships and the second type is based on kinetics involved during chlorine reaction 21 multiple linear and non linear regression techniques are found to be the most common in developing dbps predictive models other methods like ridge logistic regression and artificial neural networks have also been employed most of the predictive models are based on laboratory scaled studies but very few models have been proposed based on real water taken from distribution network 27 chowdhury et al 30 and sadiq et al 31 reviewed existing static models with their advantages and limitations both the studies discussed the development of models for total thms tthms or thms species demonstrating that several of the models were capable of generating linear correlations r2 0 90 based on results from their respective studies however majority of the models were formulated for total tthms and there is limited models evaluating individual thms species bromide ion and ammonia nitrogen the explanatory variables considered in many models such as fulvic acid chlorophyll a fluorescence geographic region seasons kinetic rate constants flow rate and or tank volume or any of several dummy variables are not easy to investigate moreover it is not possible to convert the mole based unit μmol l to mg l without knowing the dbps speciation beside this it becomes uncertain how much free chlorine would be available in the presence of ammonia for reactions leading to formation of thms 32 chattogram is the major port city and financial center in the southeastern bangladesh chattogram water supply and sewerage authority cwasa is the responsible authority for supplying water to its city dwellers cwasa is mostly using surface water to meet water demand of about 2 1 million people 33 chlorination is done at the last step of treatment process by the treatment plants of cwasa to disinfect the supply water chlorine is used as it is cheap in price and has strong oxidizing ability a minimum level of chlorine residual is maintained throughout the distribution system to protect against microbial recontamination despite of its potential to form carcinogenic dbps in bangladesh the research on the occurrence and formation of dbps in water supply developing models aiming at the development of policies is still at rudimentary level and national standards are yet to set for dbps in drinking water despite of its acute and chronic effects to human health khan et al 34 first worked on the possibility of thms formation on chlorinated textile wastewater this study investigated the thms level of chlorinated effluent of treated textile waste for different chlorine dose the study shows that chlorination of textile waste does not produce significant amount of thms below usepa limit as textile waste contains negligible amount of fulvic and humic acid suchana 32 studied the presence of thms in the water supply of dhaka city and proposed a modified mathematical model including ammonia as an influencing parameter based on limited bench scale data ahmed et al 35 conducted risk assessment for chloroform species in water supply for few locations of dhaka city and found that the people are at risk due to be exposed to chloroform species the other species of thms proved to be carcinogenic to human health should also be investigated along with the chloroform species to focus on the issues associated with thms formation including health effects and regulatory compliance is a pressing demand in bangladesh it has been a completely new field of research for chattogram city to predict the possible presence of potential dbps using mathematical models in drinking water and associated health risk to the city dwellers the modeling study on dhaka city 35 was conducted from limited bench scale data and modeling study on field level data for dbps compounds is completely lacking the present study therefore aims to predict the total trihalomethaes tthms and thms species concentration utilizing available thms empirical models from physico chemical properties of supplied water collected from different sampling points of cwasa s distribution line three empirical models developed by amy et al 36 rathbun 37 and malcolm pirnie 38 will be applied to assess the presence of thms in the water supply of the city these models allow the direct utilization of numerous influential factors as inputs data and are readily available for predicting disinfection by products dbps necessary water quality data from 11 points of distribution network of chattogram city were obtained in the study based on the predicted concentrations of thms species cancer risk assessment will be carried out for different exposure pathways it is expected that the predictive values of the study would develop a baseline data for further investigations of the concentration of thms in cwasa s water supply and can preliminary be used to estimate the human health risks associated with thms exposure 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling locations cwasa draws surface water from halda and karnafully river flowing around the city and supplies water to the city dwellers after conducting treatment in their treatment plants it has three surface water treatment plants and one ground water treatment plant which is basically for iron removal the study has considered the mohra surface water treatment plant mswtp this plant uses water from halda river and several physico chemical processes are being performed in the plant as well as disinfection process post chlorination is followed here using chlorine as a disinfectant in chlorine contact chamber at a concentration of 2 2 5 mg l to disinfect water with contact time 30 min in chlorination chamber at 90 m liters per day mld karnafully service area ksa of cwasa s distribution network was selected for the study ksa delivers treated water to 22 wards fully and 4 wards partially out of 41 wards in chattogram city fig 1 a water samples were collected from water supplies distribution network which included consumer taps from 11 different locations of chattogram city as shown in fig 1 b and only one sample from each location were taken five samples were collected in january 2020 winter and six were collected in june 2020 summer the locations of sample collections are as follows bohaddarhat area 1 bohaddarhat area 2 muradpur area 1 muradpur area 2 2 no gate area 1 2 no gate area 2 general electric company gec circle lalkhan bazar wasa agrabad and halishohor in this study these sample collection areas are represented as locations 1 to 11 respectively 2 2 characterization of water samples water samples were collected from the distribution network of cwasa at 11 sampling points by one of the authors of this study the collected samples were analyzed for a number of water quality parameters following standards methods 39 ammonia nitrogen nh3 n was measured by salicylate method in spectrophotometer model hach dr6000u and total organic carbon toc measurements were done using shimadzu toc 5000 analyzer a chlorine dose d of 2 5 mg l was used in model equations as per the applied dose in the mswtp a 6 h contact time t was assumed starting from chlorine contact chamber to the point of consumer tap as both the br ion concentration and uv254 were not analyzed in the study value of br ion concentration and uv254 were taken as 50 μg l and 0 144 respectively from a study by suchana 32 on the treated water of six water treatment plants located outside dhaka city of bangladesh 2 3 selection of predictive models for the estimation of thms species in supplied water a thorough literature review has been done prior to the selection of the available dbps models for this study three models were selected to predict the concentration for all individual thms species with different explanatory variables among the selected models two are doc based models developed by amy et al 36 denoted as model 1 and ratbun 37 which is denoted as model 2 the third one model 3 which is developed by malcolm pirnie inc 38 is also a doc based model but it includes nh3 n as one of the explanatory variables amy et al 36 developed the model on data generated from the most comprehensive bench scale study for tthms thms species this database hereafter referred to as the epa 40 database was primarily used to develop dbp models the model used doc and uv254 as indicators of natural organic matter nom in their original works of amy et al 36 another model developed by rathbun 38 for low bromide water and this model developed multiple regression models for predicting thms species formation using water samples from the mississippi missouri and ohio rivers in usa water samples were collected during the summer and fall of 1991 and spring of 1992 at 12 locations these models were developed at a constant temperature of 25 c and constant reaction time of 7 days and showed good predictability the root mean square of the model predictions and experimental data were found good as the service area receives water from the halda river which might have bromide iodine salinity due to tidal effect of the bay of bengal moreover the root mean square of the model predictions and experimental data were found good malcolm pirnie inc 38 is the model that incorporated ammonia nitrogen with other parameters in modeling thms species in chlorinated water in bangladesh ammonia content of surface waters is considerably high particularly during the dry season which might affect the formation of thms in the presence of bromide ion moreover the treatment plant of the city uses chlorine as their disinfectant and reactions between chlorine and ammonia may result in the formation of chloramines potentially suppressing formation of thms thus it is necessary to assess and quantify the effect of ammonia on the formation of thms during the chlorination of water containing organic matter as well as ammonia the selected models have been shown in table 1 in this paper these three models are expressed as model1 model2 model3 for amy et al 37 rathbun 36 and malcolm pirnie inc 38 respectively 2 4 risk assessment approach cancer risk assessment was conducted based on the predicted concentrations of thms species for multi pathway exposure united states environmental protection agency usepa guidelines usepa 1986 1999 2002 40 42 were followed which had been adopted in scientific studies in this area 33 18 22 24 assessment of cancer risk was carried out for oral ingestion inhalation and dermal exposure pathways through chronic daily intake cdi risk analysis was carried out by integrated risk information system 43 and risk assessment information system 44 with input parameters for the human risk analysis as summarized in table 2 chronic daily intakes through different exposure pathways were estimated by the equations 1 cdi ingestion mg kg day

factor mg kg day 1 for the mentioned three exposure pathways 3 results and discussions 3 1 physico chemical properties of the supplied water a statistical summary of the collected data and details of the physico chemical properties of the collected water samples are presented in table 3 and table 4 respectively the observed ph value ranged from 6 5 to 7 36 and the observed temperature of the water samples are from 21 4 to 28 4 c this variation in ph and temperature might be due to the fact that the samples were collected at various time of the year literature shows that increased ph and t values have a positive effect on the formation of thms 2 the toc content of the water samples are found between 0 783 and 5 86 mg l it is noteworthy to mention that the toc values are taken as doc in this study as no suspended solids were found in the studied water samples it is observed that higher doc value around 4 5 mg l has generally been observed at higher temperature around 28 c in the study it is found in literature that in summer a favorable condition for bacteria and algal growth in source water can cause a contribution to doc and uv254 25 48 however there is no specific relation cannot be drawn between ph and doc based on the observed results of the study on the other hand nh3 n one of the influencing parameters to the thms formation are observed between 0 011 and 0 015 mg l although that of the water samples from locations 1 3 5 7 8 and 11 was zero the water containing nh3 n value shows higher doc value except the location 11 this might be ascribed to the fact that water containing high toc may accelerate the nitrification process and therefore increase the level of nh3 n in the studied water 3 2 occurrence of tthms in the supplied water total trihalomethanes tthms concentration were estimated by summing up the concentration of four individual thms species predicted by the three models used in the study fig 2 shows that in many cases the predicted concentration of tthms is higher than usepa limit 80 ppb total thms concentration tthms at 11 sampling points varied between 20 and 440 μg l 95 215 μg l and 162 249 μg l predicted by model 1 model 2 model 3 respectively model1 estimated tthms beyond regulatory limit at 6 locations whereas tthms exceeds the limit at all the sampling points estimated by model2 and model3 the average tthms concentration by these models was found to be around 233 146 and 211 μg l respectively tthms estimated by model1 are 1 5 times higher than model2 which might be ascribed to the varying explanatory variables taken in the two models model 2 has considered doc dose ph and br the temperature 25 c and reaction time 7 h were kept constant during the development of the model on the other hand model1 considers temperature contact time in addition to the parameters of model 2 as the important factors the thms formation may increase with the increase of temperature because of the faster reaction kinetics and contact time might significantly impact the formation moreover model2 was developed using low bromide source waters and this study has taken considerable levels of bromide and thereby model2 underestimate the thms formation as the studied water samples has varying temperature different contact time model1 predicted the highest tthms of 440 ppb at location 4 and lowest of 20 ppb at location 7 highest tthms of 215 ppb is estimated at location 10 by model2 and lowest 95 ppb at location 7 model3 the nh3 based model estimated the highest tthms of 249 ppb at location 10 and lowest 162 ppb at location 7 tthms estimated by these three models vary over a wide range these results also highlight the need for actual measurement of thms at distribution network the estimated concentrations vary due to the fact that specific data sources are used to derive these models cristiana di cristo et al 49 compared the performances of the 18 selected empirical models for predicting thms formation in a real water supply system and found that some of them were not able to make good prediction the study however suggests that an error of this magnitude of predicted concentration level is accepted for practical situation in which the most important aspect is to understand whether the regulation limits are respected in all nodes of the systems however in current study model1 shows good prediction sensitivity with ph temperature and toc concentration it estimated the highest average tthms concentration 233 μg l other hand water supply content negligible amount of nh3 n table 4 therefore thms species concentration estimated by model1 fig 3 will be used in risk assessment analysis 3 3 variability in concentrations of thms species with different models with varying explanatory variables chloroform chcl3 cf was found to be the dominant thms species formed in all 11 measurement nodes accounting for 60 to 80 of the total thms expressed on a μg l concentration basis except model3 fig 4 cwasa mostly uses surface water and due to tropical weather and excessive vegetation surface water in bangladesh may contain a higher amount of organic load cf is formed in the distribution network as this source water with higher organic load is being disinfected with chlorine 32 bdcm was the main thm species estimated by model3 fig 5 as this model considers nh3 n as an explanatory parameter presence of ammonia reduces the availability of free chlorine to form cf 32 available chlorine reacts with ammonia when organic matter present in water and this reaction results the formation of chloramines potentially suppressing formation of thms bromodichloromethane bdcm was found in all samples in concentration ranging from 2 to 40 μg l estimated by model 1 and model2 whereas model3 estimated bdcm ranging 126 167 μg l dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform bf were estimated in a negligible amount by model1 and model2 model3 estimated considerable amount of dbcm ranging 10 to 18 μg l and bromoform ranging from 2 to 3 μg l this might be due to fact that models developed by model1 and model2 are chlorine based doc model whereas model3 is ammonia based model 4 cancer risk assessment as described before concentrations of thms species predicted by model1 have been used in risk assessment analysis however all the models showed that bromoform bf had negligible contribution to tthms the risk due to the presence of bf was not calculated due to its low predicted concentration less than 0 1 μg l through stepwise application of eqs 1 8 the total lifetime cancer risk levels were predicted from multi pathway exposure routes oral ingestion inhalation and dermal for 11 locations of chattogram city a 70 years of exposure duration ed average life expectancy in bangladesh with 35 min day exposure time et and 365 days per of exposure frequency ef were assumed table 2 other parameters such as conversion factor cf body weight bw average exposure time at are listed in table 2 an average lifetime cancer risk level of tthms of cwasa s water supply for the studied areas of chattogram city was found 2 8 10 4 which is higher than the minimum prescribed risk level 1 0 10 6 by usepa 50 the highest cancer risk was predicted 5 2 10 4 at location 4 and 3 6 10 5 at location 7 as expected the predicted results show that risk level is proportional to the concentration of thms oral ingestion accounts 50 of the total cancer risk dermal contact and inhalation imparted 40 and 10 contribution to the total cancer risk 4 1 cancer risk evaluation via oral route fig 6 shows the estimated cancer risk through oral ingestion for all 11 study locations the predicted life time cancer risk levels via oral exposure were found in between 2 23 10 5 to 2 3 10 4 the highest cancer risk for oral ingestion was estimated at location 4 2 3 10 4 as predicted by model1 thms concentrations in location 4 were the highest chronic daily intake for oral ingestion cdi oral values increase with the increased concentration of thms wang 51 reported that boiling of supply water reduces the concentration of thms specially cf and therefore reduces the risk in this study the risk estimation is based on the predicted concentration of thms however in real life cases boiling of drinking water reduces the concentration of thms species chloroform imparted the highest contribution to total cancer risk for oral ingestion followed by bdcm and dbcm an average lifetime cancer risk of the studied areas due to oral ingestion was predicted 1 4 10 4 for the water supply of chattogram city 4 2 cancer risk evaluation via inhalation pathway the boiling point of chloroform cf is very low and it may be assumed that during regular activities like washing bathing showering etc cf is the major compound to which people are exposed to 19 in closed bathroom or shower room people breathe accumulated air enriched with thms species mainly cf during inhalation models developed by little 46 were applied to calculate the thms species concentration in air cair different parameters of these models such as overall mass transfer coefficient kola henry s law constant at 40 c h air flow rate qg water flow rate ql bathroom volume vs etc are tabulated in table 2 it was predicted that approximately 3 8 of cf 0 129 of bdcm and 0 055 of dbcm were evaporated from water which indicates a negligible concentration of other thms species in air other than cf chronic daily intake for inhalation cdi inhalation of thms species were predicted by eq 4 an average exposure time t of 25 min was taken other additional parameters such as ingestion rate ir etc are listed in table 2 chronic daily intake for inhalation cdiinhalation of thms species increases with the increased concentration of cair cdiinhalation of chloroform cf was found to be highest in value as expected an average lifetime cancer risk of the studied areas due to inhalation was predicted 1 1 10 4 for the water supply of chattogram city chloroform is the major contributor above 99 to the total cancer risk for inhalation the findings are consistent with the previous study 21 22 52 found in literature 4 3 cancer risk evaluation via dermal contact in case of dermal contact penetration of thms species into body through skin depends on the permeability of different thms species chronic daily intake for dermal exposure cdidermal of thms species eq 3 varies mainly for two parameters permeability co efficient pc and species concentration cw in water as the value of other parameters are kept same based on pc value thms species can be arranged as cf bdcm dbcm bf table 2 as expected highest cancer risk value for dermal exposure was found for chloroform cf because of its high predicted concentration cw in water supply and permeability co efficient pc total lifetime cancer risk level from exposure to thms through dermal contact were found from 3 2 10 6 to 5 5 10 5 higher than prescribed risk level 1 0 10 6 fig 7 iii cf is the major contributor up to 99 3 to life time cancer risk due to dermal exposure in comparing oral and dermal exposure jo et al 53 demonstrated that daily dermal intakes were approximately 32 5 of oral intakes dermal intakes from thms daily were 40 70 of daily ingestion doses as demonstrated by cleek and bunge 54 however this study did not consider the variability in parameters in predicting the risk level for more accurate prediction variability in different parameters such as exposed area exposure duration may be incorporated 5 risk minimization by controlling thms levels although the study is based on very limited data and used empirical models the findings indicate the probable occurrence of tthms in drinking water of chattogram city and the city dwellers might face various health diseases due to the consumption of toxic dbps ozone uv ray etc as alternative disinfectants are being used in many countries of the world to avoid the adverse health effects of dbps chlorine is however being used in the developing countries especially in bangladesh because of its availability and cost effectiveness special attention should therefore be paid to manage these by products safely removal of precursor is the most effective strategy to control the levels of dbps in chlorinated drinking water in developed countries various pretreatment technologies have been exploited prior to chlorination to reduce the generation of dbps appropriate mathematical model could be useful tool for controlling precursors which will help to manage dbp at the water utility scale development of a viable dbps formation model for water supply distribution network of cwasa is now a pressing demand evaluating the required reduction in precursors the existing dbps thms models differ in origin and structure and developed for different quality of source water and operational parameters the model based on field scale data with specific water source and treatment process could be used for predicting the formation and changes of thms species in water distribution network the predicted concentration of thms may guide the water supply authority to adjust different water quality parameters to minimize thms levels in drinking water as well as human health risk 6 conclusions the study of disinfection by products is a new field of research for water supply of chattogram city and no field data is available to focus on dbps associated with human health the study has been conducted to assess the possible occurrence of thms one of the potential dbps in water supply of chattogram city three predictive models denoted as model1 model2 model have been used to estimate the concentration of thms from measured water quality data of water samples taken from the city s distribution network it is observed that concentration of thms is higher than usepa limit 80 ppb at six locations out of 11 studied locations as per model1 while the predicted values of model2 and model3 exceed the acceptable limit at all the locations chloroform chcl3 is found dominant form followed by bromo dichloromethane chbrcl2 among the four thms species according to model 1 and model 3 whereas bdcm is the main thms species estimated by model3 variation in estimated thms species estimated by the three models might be ascribed to the varying explanatory variables consideration in the models and the water quality and operational parameters taken in the study the results however highlight the need for actual measurement of thms at distribution network lifetime carcinogenic health risk is also assessed based on the predicted levels of thms the city dwellers might be at cancer risk due to multi pathway exposure of thms species an average lifetime cancer risk posed by tthms of cwasa s water supply for the studied area of chattogram city is found to be 2 8 10 4 which is more than 100 times higher than minimum risk level of usepa guidelines chloroform imparted the highest cancer risk through the pathway of oral ingestion however during the calculation of risk assessment variability of various input parameters were not considered and incorporation of variability may improve the accuracy of risk assessment the predicted value of thms in water supply of chattogram city and associated cancer risk through the consumption of the water may be used to obtain baseline

13476,this study predicts the possible occurrence of trihalomethanes thms in water supply of chattrogram city in bangladesh and life time cancer risk from multi pathway intakes of the trihalomethanes thms to the city dwellers a total of 11 water samples were collected from the distribution network of the city and few water quality parameters were analyzed in the study three empirical models developed by amy et al 1998 rathbun 1996 and malcolm pirnie 1993 were used to estimate the level of thms from measured water quality data and were denoted as model1 model2 and model3 respectively in the study lifetime cancer risk was estimated using predicted chronic daily intakes cdi of thms species for different exposure routes ingestion inhalation and dermal the total concentrations of thms ranged between 20 and 440 μg l 95 215 μg l and 162 249 μg l were predicted by model1 model2 and model3 respectively an average lifetime cancer risk was predicted as 1 4 10 4 1 1 10 4 and 2 9 10 4 for oral inhalation and dermal exposure respectively from the water supply of the city percent contribution to total lifetime cancer risk were predicted as 50 40 and10 for oral ingestion inhalation and dermal absorption respectively the study revealed that lifetime cancer risk values were higher than minimum risk level set by united states environmental protection agency the findings of possible occurrence of thms in the water supply and associated cancer risk might be beneficial as baseline data for further investigation and help the decision makers regarding the formulation of standards and legislations of thms keywords disinfection drinking water disinfection by products model cancer risk 1 introduction water disinfection has been practiced worldwide as an essential step in water treatment process to minimize the microbial pathogenic infection formation of disinfection by products dbps occurs for the chemical reaction of disinfectants and natural organic matter present in water 1 3 in municipal water supply system from treatment plant to consumer tap various classes of dbps may be formed at any point of the distribution line depending upon the availability of precursors and the disinfectant 4 5 chlorine is the most widely used disinfectants worldwide and in municipal water supply facilities residual chlorine reacts with the organic and inorganic precursors to form carcinogenic chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps 6 7 the study of dbps in water took the interest of the researchers for their carcinogenicity and adverse health effects 1 8 11 various classes of dbps compounds include trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans and haloketones hks thms compounds are the most studied and abundant group of dbps in water supply thms species include chloroform cf bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform bf the sum of these four chemical substances refers to as total trihalomethanes tthms 2 3 13 natural organic matter nom concentration level of raw water plays the critical role in the formation of dbps 13 14 different water quality parameters such as ph temperature ammonia carbonate alkalinity bromide operational conditions such as disinfectant dose contact time are identified as the important influential factors as well 1 5 12 13 14 the usepa 15 has established the threshold level of 0 08 mg l 80 ppb for total thms the current regulations in china for chloroform cf bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform bf are 60 60 100 100 μg l respectively 14 the who guidelines 100 ppb for tthms are currently adopted by many countries and regions 16 bangladesh standard for water quality parameters has set the standard 90 ppb for chloroform trichloromehane chcl3 only 17 however no drinking water quality guideline exists for total or other dbps species in the country exposure pathways of thms species for the people may be categorized into three oral ingestion inhalation and dermal absorption showering bathing washing swimming are the regular indoor activities by which people are exposed to thms through inhalation and dermal absorption 2 5 9 18 dbps in drinking water have positive association with cancer and potential adverse reproductive effects numerous studies found that dbps that have been associated with several adverse health effects from long term exposure including bladder and colorectal cancer and adverse birth outcomes 8 10 16 few studies have been investigated the relationship between chlorination of drinking water and cancer mortality through toxicological laboratory studies 19 22 a linkage between exposure to chlorinated drinking water and the development of urinary bladder cancer is detected 9 10 21 moreover kidney liver and intestinal tumorigenesis are also found to be associated with chronic ingestion of thms 22 23 to control dbps formation various pretreatment technologies are applied before chlorination in developed countries removal of precursors is the most effective way to reduce the formation of dbps 1 3 5 to ensure limited dbps formation in distribution line the water works of these countries adjust the operational parameters and influencing factors of dbp through monitoring dbps concentration level regularly 5 however there is no strategy or plans to control dbps in water treatment plants in bangladesh monitoring of thms is a time consuming and laborious work which involves complex process for sample extraction and expensive instrument 24 26 hence particular interest has been directed on development of models to estimate the formation of thm which may be an alternative of thms measurement in the field 26 27 29 adaptation of empirical models linear or log linear available in the literature can be a simplified solution to meet the primary interest in the field of thms research 28 30 a significant number of mathematical models have been developed to predict dbps in drinking water 18 21 27 30 incorporating water quality parameters as well the operational conditions of the water treatment plants in the past three decades dbps models can be roughly classified into two types first type is based on empirical relationships and the second type is based on kinetics involved during chlorine reaction 21 multiple linear and non linear regression techniques are found to be the most common in developing dbps predictive models other methods like ridge logistic regression and artificial neural networks have also been employed most of the predictive models are based on laboratory scaled studies but very few models have been proposed based on real water taken from distribution network 27 chowdhury et al 30 and sadiq et al 31 reviewed existing static models with their advantages and limitations both the studies discussed the development of models for total thms tthms or thms species demonstrating that several of the models were capable of generating linear correlations r2 0 90 based on results from their respective studies however majority of the models were formulated for total tthms and there is limited models evaluating individual thms species bromide ion and ammonia nitrogen the explanatory variables considered in many models such as fulvic acid chlorophyll a fluorescence geographic region seasons kinetic rate constants flow rate and or tank volume or any of several dummy variables are not easy to investigate moreover it is not possible to convert the mole based unit μmol l to mg l without knowing the dbps speciation beside this it becomes uncertain how much free chlorine would be available in the presence of ammonia for reactions leading to formation of thms 32 chattogram is the major port city and financial center in the southeastern bangladesh chattogram water supply and sewerage authority cwasa is the responsible authority for supplying water to its city dwellers cwasa is mostly using surface water to meet water demand of about 2 1 million people 33 chlorination is done at the last step of treatment process by the treatment plants of cwasa to disinfect the supply water chlorine is used as it is cheap in price and has strong oxidizing ability a minimum level of chlorine residual is maintained throughout the distribution system to protect against microbial recontamination despite of its potential to form carcinogenic dbps in bangladesh the research on the occurrence and formation of dbps in water supply developing models aiming at the development of policies is still at rudimentary level and national standards are yet to set for dbps in drinking water despite of its acute and chronic effects to human health khan et al 34 first worked on the possibility of thms formation on chlorinated textile wastewater this study investigated the thms level of chlorinated effluent of treated textile waste for different chlorine dose the study shows that chlorination of textile waste does not produce significant amount of thms below usepa limit as textile waste contains negligible amount of fulvic and humic acid suchana 32 studied the presence of thms in the water supply of dhaka city and proposed a modified mathematical model including ammonia as an influencing parameter based on limited bench scale data ahmed et al 35 conducted risk assessment for chloroform species in water supply for few locations of dhaka city and found that the people are at risk due to be exposed to chloroform species the other species of thms proved to be carcinogenic to human health should also be investigated along with the chloroform species to focus on the issues associated with thms formation including health effects and regulatory compliance is a pressing demand in bangladesh it has been a completely new field of research for chattogram city to predict the possible presence of potential dbps using mathematical models in drinking water and associated health risk to the city dwellers the modeling study on dhaka city 35 was conducted from limited bench scale data and modeling study on field level data for dbps compounds is completely lacking the present study therefore aims to predict the total trihalomethaes tthms and thms species concentration utilizing available thms empirical models from physico chemical properties of supplied water collected from different sampling points of cwasa s distribution line three empirical models developed by amy et al 36 rathbun 37 and malcolm pirnie 38 will be applied to assess the presence of thms in the water supply of the city these models allow the direct utilization of numerous influential factors as inputs data and are readily available for predicting disinfection by products dbps necessary water quality data from 11 points of distribution network of chattogram city were obtained in the study based on the predicted concentrations of thms species cancer risk assessment will be carried out for different exposure pathways it is expected that the predictive values of the study would develop a baseline data for further investigations of the concentration of thms in cwasa s water supply and can preliminary be used to estimate the human health risks associated with thms exposure 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling locations cwasa draws surface water from halda and karnafully river flowing around the city and supplies water to the city dwellers after conducting treatment in their treatment plants it has three surface water treatment plants and one ground water treatment plant which is basically for iron removal the study has considered the mohra surface water treatment plant mswtp this plant uses water from halda river and several physico chemical processes are being performed in the plant as well as disinfection process post chlorination is followed here using chlorine as a disinfectant in chlorine contact chamber at a concentration of 2 2 5 mg l to disinfect water with contact time 30 min in chlorination chamber at 90 m liters per day mld karnafully service area ksa of cwasa s distribution network was selected for the study ksa delivers treated water to 22 wards fully and 4 wards partially out of 41 wards in chattogram city fig 1 a water samples were collected from water supplies distribution network which included consumer taps from 11 different locations of chattogram city as shown in fig 1 b and only one sample from each location were taken five samples were collected in january 2020 winter and six were collected in june 2020 summer the locations of sample collections are as follows bohaddarhat area 1 bohaddarhat area 2 muradpur area 1 muradpur area 2 2 no gate area 1 2 no gate area 2 general electric company gec circle lalkhan bazar wasa agrabad and halishohor in this study these sample collection areas are represented as locations 1 to 11 respectively 2 2 characterization of water samples water samples were collected from the distribution network of cwasa at 11 sampling points by one of the authors of this study the collected samples were analyzed for a number of water quality parameters following standards methods 39 ammonia nitrogen nh3 n was measured by salicylate method in spectrophotometer model hach dr6000u and total organic carbon toc measurements were done using shimadzu toc 5000 analyzer a chlorine dose d of 2 5 mg l was used in model equations as per the applied dose in the mswtp a 6 h contact time t was assumed starting from chlorine contact chamber to the point of consumer tap as both the br ion concentration and uv254 were not analyzed in the study value of br ion concentration and uv254 were taken as 50 μg l and 0 144 respectively from a study by suchana 32 on the treated water of six water treatment plants located outside dhaka city of bangladesh 2 3 selection of predictive models for the estimation of thms species in supplied water a thorough literature review has been done prior to the selection of the available dbps models for this study three models were selected to predict the concentration for all individual thms species with different explanatory variables among the selected models two are doc based models developed by amy et al 36 denoted as model 1 and ratbun 37 which is denoted as model 2 the third one model 3 which is developed by malcolm pirnie inc 38 is also a doc based model but it includes nh3 n as one of the explanatory variables amy et al 36 developed the model on data generated from the most comprehensive bench scale study for tthms thms species this database hereafter referred to as the epa 40 database was primarily used to develop dbp models the model used doc and uv254 as indicators of natural organic matter nom in their original works of amy et al 36 another model developed by rathbun 38 for low bromide water and this model developed multiple regression models for predicting thms species formation using water samples from the mississippi missouri and ohio rivers in usa water samples were collected during the summer and fall of 1991 and spring of 1992 at 12 locations these models were developed at a constant temperature of 25 c and constant reaction time of 7 days and showed good predictability the root mean square of the model predictions and experimental data were found good as the service area receives water from the halda river which might have bromide iodine salinity due to tidal effect of the bay of bengal moreover the root mean square of the model predictions and experimental data were found good malcolm pirnie inc 38 is the model that incorporated ammonia nitrogen with other parameters in modeling thms species in chlorinated water in bangladesh ammonia content of surface waters is considerably high particularly during the dry season which might affect the formation of thms in the presence of bromide ion moreover the treatment plant of the city uses chlorine as their disinfectant and reactions between chlorine and ammonia may result in the formation of chloramines potentially suppressing formation of thms thus it is necessary to assess and quantify the effect of ammonia on the formation of thms during the chlorination of water containing organic matter as well as ammonia the selected models have been shown in table 1 in this paper these three models are expressed as model1 model2 model3 for amy et al 37 rathbun 36 and malcolm pirnie inc 38 respectively 2 4 risk assessment approach cancer risk assessment was conducted based on the predicted concentrations of thms species for multi pathway exposure united states environmental protection agency usepa guidelines usepa 1986 1999 2002 40 42 were followed which had been adopted in scientific studies in this area 33 18 22 24 assessment of cancer risk was carried out for oral ingestion inhalation and dermal exposure pathways through chronic daily intake cdi risk analysis was carried out by integrated risk information system 43 and risk assessment information system 44 with input parameters for the human risk analysis as summarized in table 2 chronic daily intakes through different exposure pathways were estimated by the equations 1 cdi ingestion mg kg day

factor mg kg day 1 for the mentioned three exposure pathways 3 results and discussions 3 1 physico chemical properties of the supplied water a statistical summary of the collected data and details of the physico chemical properties of the collected water samples are presented in table 3 and table 4 respectively the observed ph value ranged from 6 5 to 7 36 and the observed temperature of the water samples are from 21 4 to 28 4 c this variation in ph and temperature might be due to the fact that the samples were collected at various time of the year literature shows that increased ph and t values have a positive effect on the formation of thms 2 the toc content of the water samples are found between 0 783 and 5 86 mg l it is noteworthy to mention that the toc values are taken as doc in this study as no suspended solids were found in the studied water samples it is observed that higher doc value around 4 5 mg l has generally been observed at higher temperature around 28 c in the study it is found in literature that in summer a favorable condition for bacteria and algal growth in source water can cause a contribution to doc and uv254 25 48 however there is no specific relation cannot be drawn between ph and doc based on the observed results of the study on the other hand nh3 n one of the influencing parameters to the thms formation are observed between 0 011 and 0 015 mg l although that of the water samples from locations 1 3 5 7 8 and 11 was zero the water containing nh3 n value shows higher doc value except the location 11 this might be ascribed to the fact that water containing high toc may accelerate the nitrification process and therefore increase the level of nh3 n in the studied water 3 2 occurrence of tthms in the supplied water total trihalomethanes tthms concentration were estimated by summing up the concentration of four individual thms species predicted by the three models used in the study fig 2 shows that in many cases the predicted concentration of tthms is higher than usepa limit 80 ppb total thms concentration tthms at 11 sampling points varied between 20 and 440 μg l 95 215 μg l and 162 249 μg l predicted by model 1 model 2 model 3 respectively model1 estimated tthms beyond regulatory limit at 6 locations whereas tthms exceeds the limit at all the sampling points estimated by model2 and model3 the average tthms concentration by these models was found to be around 233 146 and 211 μg l respectively tthms estimated by model1 are 1 5 times higher than model2 which might be ascribed to the varying explanatory variables taken in the two models model 2 has considered doc dose ph and br the temperature 25 c and reaction time 7 h were kept constant during the development of the model on the other hand model1 considers temperature contact time in addition to the parameters of model 2 as the important factors the thms formation may increase with the increase of temperature because of the faster reaction kinetics and contact time might significantly impact the formation moreover model2 was developed using low bromide source waters and this study has taken considerable levels of bromide and thereby model2 underestimate the thms formation as the studied water samples has varying temperature different contact time model1 predicted the highest tthms of 440 ppb at location 4 and lowest of 20 ppb at location 7 highest tthms of 215 ppb is estimated at location 10 by model2 and lowest 95 ppb at location 7 model3 the nh3 based model estimated the highest tthms of 249 ppb at location 10 and lowest 162 ppb at location 7 tthms estimated by these three models vary over a wide range these results also highlight the need for actual measurement of thms at distribution network the estimated concentrations vary due to the fact that specific data sources are used to derive these models cristiana di cristo et al 49 compared the performances of the 18 selected empirical models for predicting thms formation in a real water supply system and found that some of them were not able to make good prediction the study however suggests that an error of this magnitude of predicted concentration level is accepted for practical situation in which the most important aspect is to understand whether the regulation limits are respected in all nodes of the systems however in current study model1 shows good prediction sensitivity with ph temperature and toc concentration it estimated the highest average tthms concentration 233 μg l other hand water supply content negligible amount of nh3 n table 4 therefore thms species concentration estimated by model1 fig 3 will be used in risk assessment analysis 3 3 variability in concentrations of thms species with different models with varying explanatory variables chloroform chcl3 cf was found to be the dominant thms species formed in all 11 measurement nodes accounting for 60 to 80 of the total thms expressed on a μg l concentration basis except model3 fig 4 cwasa mostly uses surface water and due to tropical weather and excessive vegetation surface water in bangladesh may contain a higher amount of organic load cf is formed in the distribution network as this source water with higher organic load is being disinfected with chlorine 32 bdcm was the main thm species estimated by model3 fig 5 as this model considers nh3 n as an explanatory parameter presence of ammonia reduces the availability of free chlorine to form cf 32 available chlorine reacts with ammonia when organic matter present in water and this reaction results the formation of chloramines potentially suppressing formation of thms bromodichloromethane bdcm was found in all samples in concentration ranging from 2 to 40 μg l estimated by model 1 and model2 whereas model3 estimated bdcm ranging 126 167 μg l dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform bf were estimated in a negligible amount by model1 and model2 model3 estimated considerable amount of dbcm ranging 10 to 18 μg l and bromoform ranging from 2 to 3 μg l this might be due to fact that models developed by model1 and model2 are chlorine based doc model whereas model3 is ammonia based model 4 cancer risk assessment as described before concentrations of thms species predicted by model1 have been used in risk assessment analysis however all the models showed that bromoform bf had negligible contribution to tthms the risk due to the presence of bf was not calculated due to its low predicted concentration less than 0 1 μg l through stepwise application of eqs 1 8 the total lifetime cancer risk levels were predicted from multi pathway exposure routes oral ingestion inhalation and dermal for 11 locations of chattogram city a 70 years of exposure duration ed average life expectancy in bangladesh with 35 min day exposure time et and 365 days per of exposure frequency ef were assumed table 2 other parameters such as conversion factor cf body weight bw average exposure time at are listed in table 2 an average lifetime cancer risk level of tthms of cwasa s water supply for the studied areas of chattogram city was found 2 8 10 4 which is higher than the minimum prescribed risk level 1 0 10 6 by usepa 50 the highest cancer risk was predicted 5 2 10 4 at location 4 and 3 6 10 5 at location 7 as expected the predicted results show that risk level is proportional to the concentration of thms oral ingestion accounts 50 of the total cancer risk dermal contact and inhalation imparted 40 and 10 contribution to the total cancer risk 4 1 cancer risk evaluation via oral route fig 6 shows the estimated cancer risk through oral ingestion for all 11 study locations the predicted life time cancer risk levels via oral exposure were found in between 2 23 10 5 to 2 3 10 4 the highest cancer risk for oral ingestion was estimated at location 4 2 3 10 4 as predicted by model1 thms concentrations in location 4 were the highest chronic daily intake for oral ingestion cdi oral values increase with the increased concentration of thms wang 51 reported that boiling of supply water reduces the concentration of thms specially cf and therefore reduces the risk in this study the risk estimation is based on the predicted concentration of thms however in real life cases boiling of drinking water reduces the concentration of thms species chloroform imparted the highest contribution to total cancer risk for oral ingestion followed by bdcm and dbcm an average lifetime cancer risk of the studied areas due to oral ingestion was predicted 1 4 10 4 for the water supply of chattogram city 4 2 cancer risk evaluation via inhalation pathway the boiling point of chloroform cf is very low and it may be assumed that during regular activities like washing bathing showering etc cf is the major compound to which people are exposed to 19 in closed bathroom or shower room people breathe accumulated air enriched with thms species mainly cf during inhalation models developed by little 46 were applied to calculate the thms species concentration in air cair different parameters of these models such as overall mass transfer coefficient kola henry s law constant at 40 c h air flow rate qg water flow rate ql bathroom volume vs etc are tabulated in table 2 it was predicted that approximately 3 8 of cf 0 129 of bdcm and 0 055 of dbcm were evaporated from water which indicates a negligible concentration of other thms species in air other than cf chronic daily intake for inhalation cdi inhalation of thms species were predicted by eq 4 an average exposure time t of 25 min was taken other additional parameters such as ingestion rate ir etc are listed in table 2 chronic daily intake for inhalation cdiinhalation of thms species increases with the increased concentration of cair cdiinhalation of chloroform cf was found to be highest in value as expected an average lifetime cancer risk of the studied areas due to inhalation was predicted 1 1 10 4 for the water supply of chattogram city chloroform is the major contributor above 99 to the total cancer risk for inhalation the findings are consistent with the previous study 21 22 52 found in literature 4 3 cancer risk evaluation via dermal contact in case of dermal contact penetration of thms species into body through skin depends on the permeability of different thms species chronic daily intake for dermal exposure cdidermal of thms species eq 3 varies mainly for two parameters permeability co efficient pc and species concentration cw in water as the value of other parameters are kept same based on pc value thms species can be arranged as cf bdcm dbcm bf table 2 as expected highest cancer risk value for dermal exposure was found for chloroform cf because of its high predicted concentration cw in water supply and permeability co efficient pc total lifetime cancer risk level from exposure to thms through dermal contact were found from 3 2 10 6 to 5 5 10 5 higher than prescribed risk level 1 0 10 6 fig 7 iii cf is the major contributor up to 99 3 to life time cancer risk due to dermal exposure in comparing oral and dermal exposure jo et al 53 demonstrated that daily dermal intakes were approximately 32 5 of oral intakes dermal intakes from thms daily were 40 70 of daily ingestion doses as demonstrated by cleek and bunge 54 however this study did not consider the variability in parameters in predicting the risk level for more accurate prediction variability in different parameters such as exposed area exposure duration may be incorporated 5 risk minimization by controlling thms levels although the study is based on very limited data and used empirical models the findings indicate the probable occurrence of tthms in drinking water of chattogram city and the city dwellers might face various health diseases due to the consumption of toxic dbps ozone uv ray etc as alternative disinfectants are being used in many countries of the world to avoid the adverse health effects of dbps chlorine is however being used in the developing countries especially in bangladesh because of its availability and cost effectiveness special attention should therefore be paid to manage these by products safely removal of precursor is the most effective strategy to control the levels of dbps in chlorinated drinking water in developed countries various pretreatment technologies have been exploited prior to chlorination to reduce the generation of dbps appropriate mathematical model could be useful tool for controlling precursors which will help to manage dbp at the water utility scale development of a viable dbps formation model for water supply distribution network of cwasa is now a pressing demand evaluating the required reduction in precursors the existing dbps thms models differ in origin and structure and developed for different quality of source water and operational parameters the model based on field scale data with specific water source and treatment process could be used for predicting the formation and changes of thms species in water distribution network the predicted concentration of thms may guide the water supply authority to adjust different water quality parameters to minimize thms levels in drinking water as well as human health risk 6 conclusions the study of disinfection by products is a new field of research for water supply of chattogram city and no field data is available to focus on dbps associated with human health the study has been conducted to assess the possible occurrence of thms one of the potential dbps in water supply of chattogram city three predictive models denoted as model1 model2 model have been used to estimate the concentration of thms from measured water quality data of water samples taken from the city s distribution network it is observed that concentration of thms is higher than usepa limit 80 ppb at six locations out of 11 studied locations as per model1 while the predicted values of model2 and model3 exceed the acceptable limit at all the locations chloroform chcl3 is found dominant form followed by bromo dichloromethane chbrcl2 among the four thms species according to model 1 and model 3 whereas bdcm is the main thms species estimated by model3 variation in estimated thms species estimated by the three models might be ascribed to the varying explanatory variables consideration in the models and the water quality and operational parameters taken in the study the results however highlight the need for actual measurement of thms at distribution network lifetime carcinogenic health risk is also assessed based on the predicted levels of thms the city dwellers might be at cancer risk due to multi pathway exposure of thms species an average lifetime cancer risk posed by tthms of cwasa s water supply for the studied area of chattogram city is found to be 2 8 10 4 which is more than 100 times higher than minimum risk level of usepa guidelines chloroform imparted the highest cancer risk through the pathway of oral ingestion however during the calculation of risk assessment variability of various input parameters were not considered and incorporation of variability may improve the accuracy of risk assessment the predicted value of thms in water supply of chattogram city and associated cancer risk through the consumption of the water may be used to obtain baseline

specific biogas production and volatile solids vs removal rate focusing on performance evaluation microbial community analysis and underlying mechanisms the optimal dosage of 12 5 ml l d increased specific biogas production by 15 8 7 3 and enhanced vs removal by 18 3 1 6 in situ microaeration stimulated activity of hydrolytic enzymes enlarged sludge particle size and improved sludge dewaterability miseq sequencing analysis showed that dominant bacterial and archaeal communities were remarkably different between in situ microaeration and obligate ad process the presence of oxygen enriched relative abundances of deltaproteobacteria anaerolineae clostridia synergistia and caldilineae enabling the acid producing process to metabolize more types of substrates due to the selective enrichment in situ microaeration significantly enriched aceticlastic methanogens rather than hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the ad reactor analysis of coupling microaeration pretreatment and in situ microaeration for anaerobic digestion indicated that excessive microaeration decreased vs removal rate and methane yield owing to substrates consumption by facultative bacteria in situ microaeration based ad could be a promising process for sludge treatment and bioenergy recovery graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microaeration anaerobic digestion methane enzymatic activity microbial community 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad a mature and promising technology 1 2 with enormous developmental potentiality for waste activated sludge was treatment 3 has drawn extensive attentions in recent years for its low cost inputs low investment low energy consumption and low operation 4 and high effect outputs largely was mass and volume reduction effectively carbon footprint mitigation inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms and bioenergy recovery 5 however the anaerobic conversion efficiency of was treatment was of poor quality in china compared with that in developed countries 3

investment for was management 6 further baffled the application and popularization of ad process so the proportion of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps adopting ad technology was only about 2 in china greatly lower than the average ratio above 50 in developed countries 2 to overcome these bottlenecks and make progress of ad effective measures should be taken in terms of technology and management as for the ad process itself three main approaches such as optimization of operational conditions 9 supplement of additives 3 and pretreatment of was have been proposed to improve both efficiency and bioconversion degree of was in fact no matter which method was adopted the strengthening mechanism should be to maintain a balance in kinetics and energy during the four stages hydrolysis acidification acetogenesis methanogenesis of anaerobic reactions so as to improve the overall stability of ad system as well as enhance methane production 1 9 besides the pretreatment methods including physical chemical biological technologies or their combinations 3 5 were also employed to promote hydrolysis rate and improve system stability 10 the additives e g nutrient zero valent iron nanomaterials and conductive materials 3 were used to benefit biogas production from sludge 11 however certain pretreatment processes or supplement of additives usually required additional energy and or chemicals which not only increased operational costs and complexity but also caused a series of environmental problems 12 developing a more environmentally friendly and economically feasible strategy should be taken into consideration recent studies showed that microaeration was more environmentally friendly and cheaper than other pretreatment methods 13 and had advantages of enhancing hydrolysis 12 maintaining low volatile fatty acid vfas concentration 14 and removing h2s from biogas 1 besides the activity of anaerobic bacteria could not be harmfully affected by microaerobic condition owing to the rapid and almost entire consumption of injected o2 15 fu et al 16 found limited oxygen supply significantly increased cellulase activity and cumulative methane production cmp by 10 9 49 0 and 10 2 respectively although previous literatures have studied effects of microaerobic condition on ad of corn straw 17 food waste 18 cellulose and miscanthus 13 etc there was limited information about effects of in situ microaeration on the shift of microbial community structure and enzymatic activity of ad for was so incisive understandings of the mechanisms and microbial metabolism of in situ microaerated ad systems are still needed in this work different oxygen loads were firstly applied to investigate effects of in situ microaeration on the ad performance then enzymatic activity microbial community structure and specific methanogenic activity were investigated to demonstrate the reasons for the elevated ad performance under the circumstance of in situ microaeration lastly in consideration of microaeration pretreatment enhancing methane production yield and rate of ad for was 19 bench scale experiments were conducted to clarify the technical feasibility associated with energy balance and cost estimates for in situ microaeration and its combination with microaeration pretreatment on ad for was 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum mixed sludge ms employed as substrate for this research consisted of 40 primary sludge and 60 was collected from the bailonggang wwtp shanghai china digestion sludge ds served as inoculum was taken from a pilot scale mesophilic digester 35 0 1 0 c with semi continuous feeding of ms acquired from the same source the main features of ms used were as follows volatile solids vs of 23 7 0 9 g l total solids ts of 40 6 1 6 g l total chemical oxygen demand cod of 29 730 1842 mg l soluble cod of 458 11 mg l ammonium nitrogen nh4 n of 58 7 2 6 mg l total organic carbon toc of 133 5 1 4 mg l vfas

identical continuous stirred tank reactors cstr with working volume of 14 l at 35 0 1 0 c fig 1 the test cstr r1 was amended with air at dose of 12 5 phase i and 25 air volume per sludge volume per day ml l d phase ii by in situ microaeration treatment with manual syringe respectively the control cstr r2 was operated as conventional ad without aeration the initial ms was inoculated and acclimated for 40 days then two reactors were continuously operated to verify the effects of in situ microaeration on ad efficiency a wet gas flow meter and an online ph meter were employed to monitor biogas volume and ph the flow rate of ms substrate injected into each reactor was 0 7 l d by a peristaltic pump meanwhile another cstr fed with microaeration pretreated sludge ma reactor was operated to validate effect of ma on ad technology ma was obtained under the optimum conditions 4 air volume per gram ts per minute for 4 h on the basis of our previous research 19 2 3 enzymatic activity

biotech on the basis of former reported methods 19 2 4 bacterial and archaeal community analysis miseq sequencing was adopted to analyze influences of in situ microaeration on the evolution of bacterial and archaeal community structure of sludge by collecting samples from r1 and r2 at day 20 the detailed experimental procedures of genomic dna extraction pcr amplification 16s rrna gene sequencing biodiversity and phylogenetic analysis could be obtained in ruan et al 19 and hou et al 20 then 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units by setting a distance cut off of 0 03 α 2 5 coupling microaeration pretreatment and in situ microaeration for anaerobic digestion batch assays were carried out at 35 0 1 0 c in 250 ml digester bottles in order to investigate synergistic effects of microaeration pretreatment and in situ microaeration on methane production of ad two different biomass sources collected from r1 and r2 at day 20 were used as inoculums and designated as rs1 and rs2 the detailed design of batch experiments is demonstrated in table 1 firstly four glass bottles were added with 40 ml inoculated sludge and 160 ml substrate sludge respectively then ph was adjusted and maintained at 7 2 0 1 by using 2 m hcl and 2 m naoh lastly all bottles were degassed with nitrogen 99 99 for 10 min to displace air and supply absolutely anaerobic environment before starting the experiment and then incubated at 35 0 1 0 c up to 14 days in a water bath besides a moderate manual stirring for several seconds was carried out for each bottle several times per day for purpose of maintaining sludge homogeneity the production of biogas was quantified volumetrically by water displacement test method with a bottle full of 3 w w naoh solution connected to absorb h2s and co2 2 6 kinetic analysis cmp curves during the batch assays were calculated by fitting the experimental methane production data with modified gompertz equation eq

concentration was determined by a multi n c 3100 analyzer analyti jena germany extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted and stratified to slime eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps according to reported methods 22 23 the concentrations of ps and pn in each eps fraction were monitored following the modified anthrone method and lowry method 24 vfas were measured by a gc 7900p fid gas chromatograph tianmei china the amount of methane was determined by gc tcd equipped with parallel column of 1 1 m 3 16 molsieve 137 and 0 7 m 1 4 chromosorb 108 specific

with an sald 2201 laser diffraction particle size analyzer shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 semi continuous flow experiment fig 2 demonstrates the changes of specific biogas yield and vs removal efficiency in the semi continuous flow anaerobic reactors with without in situ microaeration as shown in fig 2a the specific biogas yield fluctuated in the two reactors mainly because of varied organic matter contents and characteristics of ms collecting from the real wwtps the contribution of injected air to the specific gas yield was about 0 7 0 2 compared to r2 for control in situ microaeration increased the average specific biogas yield by 15 8 7 3 with air dosage ranging from 0 to 12 5 ml l d the specific biogas yield increased gradually in phase ii because the organic matter content of ms increased in winter in this stage the average specific biogas yield of r1 138 7 29 6 ml g vs was 13 1 6 7 higher than that of r2 123 3 28 8 ml g vs the results suggested that high oxygen supply did not further improve the specific biogas yield because higher aeration intensity might inhibit the activity of methanogens increase the oxidation of intermediate soluble products and then reduce methane yield 18 correspondingly the average vs removal of r1 in phase i and ii were 24 9 1 5 and 23 0 1 5 respectively both higher than those of r2 18 3 1 6 and 17 9 0 9 the average specific biogas yield of ma reactor fed with microaeration pretreated sludge was 135 4 22 4 ml g vs which was 11 7 2 4 higher than that of the control reactor fed with raw sludge in this sense enhancement for biogas production of ad by in situ microaeration was slightly superior to that by microaeration pretreatment 3 2 variation of eps and sludge properties as an intricate mixture of polymers eps are main ingredients of was floc matrix and play a crucial role in sludge flocculation sedimentation compression and dewaterability 25 as shown in table 2 in situ microaeration led to remarkable changes in the production of slime eps lb eps and tb eps compared with r2 the total concentrations of pn and ps in slime eps and lb eps for sludge discharged from r1 both decreased while those in tb eps increased yuan and wang 26 revealed a notable connection between sludge reduction and the degradation of tb eps and cell lysis the lower contents of ps and pn in tb eps for sludge discharged from r2 indicated that in situ microaeration motivated cell breakup and then led to the diffusion of eps from inner layer to outer layer especially through the disintegration of pn in tb eps 27 the pn ps ratio for sludge discharged from r1 ranged from 5 2 to 5 6 whereas that for sludge discharged from r2 varied from 2 3 to 4 6 eps with relatively high pn content would be hydrolyzed to serve as carbon and energy source for gas production 28 to ease the shortage of nutrient in substrate compared to r2 srf and cst of sludge discharged from r1 decreased by 14 7 and 14 0 table 2 indicating that dewaterability of ms improved by in situ microaeration better sludge dewaterability of an ad process operated under microaerobic condition was also reported by jenicek et al 29 a higher pn ps ratio of sludge discharged from r1 could be associated with well dewatering capacity along with hydrophobicity 30 moreover lb eps and tb eps were reported to play a vital role in dominating sludge dewaterability lb tb eps ratio for sludge discharged from r1 0 18 were lower than that from r2 0 30 supporting the enhancement of sludge dewaterability by in situ microaeration 23 the decreased lb tb eps ratio also manifested the strengthening of flocs structure and the improvement of sludge aggregation this result was in accordance with a clear increased particle size of sludge in r1 compared with r2 table 2 3 3 influence of in situ microaeration over enzymatic activity protease and α glucosidase main extracellular hydrolase in sludge mixture play a central role in degrading soluble pn and ps into small molecular organic matters such as amino acids and monosaccharide 7 as the universal energy currency of biological realm atp generated via substrate level phosphorylation 1 can be served as an indicator of biological activity and viable biomass in biological studies 22 during the whole operation period fig 3 activities of protease glucosidase and atp of raw ms had a small fluctuation and were maintained at 11 4 1 3 1 7 0 2 and 9 6 1 8 iu g vss the maximum values of protease α glucosidase and atp were achieved in r1 reaching 33 0 5 1 and 26 0 iu g vss on day 1 which were 2 5 2 2 and 2 9 times of those in r2 these results indicated that in situ microaeration enhanced secretion of hydrolase accelerated energetic conversions of intermediates to sustain overall stability in ad processes and finally improved the ad efficiency 1 besides in situ microaerobic condition could also be a promising tactic to facilitate the generation of atp and enhance the specific microbial activity which had a bearing on the release of organic matters by the higher cell lysis rate in r1 31 3 4 comparison on microbial community structures 3 4 1 bacterial community fig 4 depicts the bacterial composition of the two sludge samples collected from r1 and r2 at phylum and class levels although most abundant bacterial phyla were similar in two sludge samples the relative abundances differed from each other as shown in fig 4a proteobacteria 29 40 34 89 chloroflexi 13 41 21 24 bacteroidetes 6 57 12 17 actinobacteria 6 17 7 36 acidobacteria 4 93 5 68 firmicutes 3 42 3 97 aminicenantes 3 59 3 72 saccharibacteria 3 02 3 93 ws6 2 81 4 02 synergistetes 2 47 2 26 and parcubacteria 1 24 2 68 were the most dominant phyla in each sample among these dominant phyla relative abundances of four phyla playing prominent roles in hydrolysis and hydrogenogenic acidogenesis during ad of sludge 32 chloroflexi firmicutes synergistetes and parcubacteria in r1 were 58 4 16 1 3 4 and 116 3 higher than those in r2 chloroflexi was reported as one of the numerically important glucose degrading bacterial groups responsible for acidogenesis and h2 oxidizing homoacetogenesis in ad process 33 and could utilize various carbohydrates and amino acids as substrates 34 the relative abundances of these phyla confirmed the increase in protease and α glucosidase production fig 3 under microaerobic condition which could enhance hydrolysis of proteins and other complex organic substrates firmicutes had this ability of secreting extracellular enzymes closely related to the metabolism of protein lipids cellulose and hemicelluloses 34 firmicutes was also associated with the bioconversion of ps to butyric propionic and acetic acids 35 and had the thick cell wall to produce endospores for survival in extreme conditions 36 higher relative abundance of firmicutes in r1 meant greater ability to degrade complex substrate leading to higher hydrolysis rate under in situ microaerobic condition 17 synergistetes was notable to ferment ps to acetate and h2 37 parcubacteria principally fermented simple sugars to organic acids and some species also had the ability of degrading complex carbon sources 38 relatively higher abundance of the above mentioned phyla signified that efficient hydrolysis fermentation and acidogenesis were acquired in the anaerobic digester upon in situ microaeration 39 the bacteria diversity at the class level in fig 4b demonstrates more information on microbial community evolution between r1 and r2 alphaproteobacteria 8 8 9 1 betaproteobacteria 6 9 12 0 gammaproteobacteria 8 0 8 9 and deltaproteobacteria 4 9 5 6 affiliated to phylum proteobacteria and functioned as dominating consumers of vfas and glucose 19 were the predominant four classes followed by actinobacteria 6 2 7 4 acidobacteria 4 9 5 7 anaerolineae 5 4 8 6 clostridia 2 4 2 7 aminicenantes 3 6 3 7 synergistia 2 5 2 6 and caldilineae 1 9 2 9 in comparison to r2 relative abundances of deltaproteobacteria anaerolineae clostridia synergistia and caldilineae in r1 increased by 14 5 57 9 13 6 3 4 and 55 4 respectively most deltaproteobacteria were well known as acetate butyrate propionate and glucose utilizing microbial communities 40 anaerolineae and caldilineae were in charge of hydrolysis and fermentation of organic matters 20 and are members of phylum chloroflexi discovered to be essential for glucose utilization 40 clostridia the main bacterial class of phylum firmicutes could utilize various carbohydrates and transform complex macromolecules into simple products 41 compared to obligate anaerobic condition hydrolysis fermentation and acidogenesis under the presence of oxygen in the anaerobic digester gave rise to the relative abundances of deltaproteobacteria anaerolineae clostridia synergistia and caldilineae which will enable the acid producing process to metabolize more types of substrates 3 4 2 archaeal community fig 5 displays the composition of archaeal community in r1 and r2 at class and genus levels as can be seen from fig 5a the dominant classes detected in r1 and r2 were aceticlastic hydrogenotrophic methanomicrobia and hydrogenotrophic methanobacteria which in total composed 97 1 r1 and 96 4 r2 of the entire archaeal community respectively although the first two dominant classes in r1 and r2 did not shift in situ microaeration caused a significant decrease of methanobacteria 27 8 for r1 and 45 1 for r2 but enriched methanomicrobia 69 3 for r1 and 51 3 for r2 42 as illustrated in fig 5b the obligate aceticlastic methanogenic genus methanosaeta and the obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogenic genus methanobacterium 42 43 were dominant in r1 and r2 with total relative abundances of 94 0 r1 and 93 4 r2 respectively the relative abundances of methanosaeta and methanobacterium were 67 6 and 26 4 in r1 and 49 0 and 44 4 in r2 indicating that in situ microaeration in r1 favored the growth of methanosaeta but prejudiced methanobacterium kiener and leisinger 44 also demonstrated that longer periods of contact with oxygen could damage the viability of methanobacterium these results also indicated that the main methanogenic pathway in r1 was aceticlastic methanogenesis zheng and raskin 45 reported that methanosaeta species were also observed to be the predominant archaea in a variety of anaerobic reactors at low acetate concentrations but their numbers decreased fast as the acetate concentration increased however in the presence of a small amount of oxygen acetic acid reacts with oxygen to maintain a dynamic equilibrium of acetic acid concentration thus maintaining the higher activity and relative abundance of methanosaeta 46 as a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen 47 methanobrevibacter was reported to utilize h2 co2 or formate as substrates 48 and existed in two sludge samples with low abundance ranging from 0 69 to 1 3 overall the proportions of archaeal community in r1 changed significantly compared to r2 because of the in situ microaeration which significantly promoted enrichment of aceticlastic methanogens in ad reactor rather than hydrogenotrophic methanogens 3 5 energy balance and cost estimates for in situ microaeration and its combination with microaeration pretreatment for ad in situ microaeration was found to be a valid method to enhance biogas production and vs removal efficiency fig 2 besides in consideration of microaeration pretreatment strengthening methane production yield and rate 19 bench scale experiments were implemented to investigate the techno economic feasibility associated with the estimated energy balance and cost of in situ microaeration and its combination with microaeration pretreatment on ad of was fig 6 describes variations of cmp and vs removal of raw ms and ma with inoculated sludge from r1 and r2 on day 14 the cmp obtained under various experimental conditions was in the following sequence of ms rs1 100 7 ml g vs ma rs1 88 6 ml g vs ma rs2 80 9 ml g vs ms rs2 64 0 ml g vs fig 6a the determined cmp was then regressed with the modified gompertz equation eq 1 using non linear regression algorithm in originpro 8 1 and the fitting results are displayed in table 1 the results illustrate a well fit to experimental cmp data r 2 0 9999 compared to ms rs2 microaerobic condition brought the change of p by 69 0 46 7 and 33 5 and of r m by 54 9 55 9 and 60 8 for ms rs1 ma rs1 and ma rs2 respectively showing that microaerobic condition enhanced cmp but decreased the methane production rate fig 6b shows the average removal efficiency among different combination after 14 days in the sequence of ms rs1 44 4 2 8 ma rs1 36 0 2 2 ma rs2 33 1 1 4 ms rs2 28 1 2 6 the trend of vs removal accorded well with the cmp the above results indicated that enhancement in hydrolysis and acidogenesis under in situ microaeration might generate more substrates for methanogens leading to higher specific methanogenic activity and final methane yield in ad process 1 while coupling microaeration pretreatment and in situ microaeration decreased not only specific biogas yield but also vs removal efficiency in comparison to in situ microaeration alone for sludge ad in all above applications of microaeration it should need to consider the substrate competition between facultative bacteria and anaerobic methanogens in order to acquire strengthened digestion while preventing entire reduction in methane yield due to consumption of substrates by facultative bacteria 1 it is estimated that 1 kg ch4 can generate electricity for a capacity of 5 13 kwh 49 therefore compared with ms rs2 the enhanced methane yields for in situ microaeration ms rs1 microaeration pretreatment ma rs2 and combination treatment ma rs1 generated electricity of 0 111 0 051 and 0 074 kwh kg vs meanwhile microaeration saved costs of sludge treatment and disposal by 0 0152 0 0047 and 0 0074 kg vs for ms rs1 ma rs2 and ma rs1 by improving vs digestion with typical investment of 218 ton dried solids 50 so the total investment reduced by microaeration was 0 0223 0 0079 and 0 0122 kg vs considering the power consumption of 0 13 kwh microaeration pretreatment and 0 0012 kwh in situ microaeration 4 conclusion this research supplied perceptions into performance microbial community and mechanism of an innovative mesophilic ad process under in situ microaeration treatment in situ microaeration obtained a 15 8 7 3 gain in average specific biogas yield and a 37 1 12 1 increase in vs removal efficiency at 12 5 ml l d air dosage compared to the obligate ad process in situ microaeration stimulated activity of hydrolytic enzymes enlarged sludge particle size and improved sludge dewaterability however excessive air dosage of 25 ml l d decreased both specific biogas yield and vs removal efficiency remarkable differences in dominant bacterial and archaeal species were observed between the in situ microaeration and the obligate ad processes the methanogenic genus methanosaeta 67 6 predominated the archaeal community in the in situ microaeration ad process and facilitated the accelerated degradation of diverse substrates via aceticlastic pathway techno economic analysis associated with energy balance and cost estimates for in situ microaeration and its combination with microaeration pretreatment for ad also indicated that excessive microaeration could cause reduction in methane yield and vs removal efficiency owing to substrates consumption by facultative bacteria declaration of

specific biogas production and volatile solids vs removal rate focusing on performance evaluation microbial community analysis and underlying mechanisms the optimal dosage of 12 5 ml l d increased specific biogas production by 15 8 7 3 and enhanced vs removal by 18 3 1 6 in situ microaeration stimulated activity of hydrolytic enzymes enlarged sludge particle size and improved sludge dewaterability miseq sequencing analysis showed that dominant bacterial and archaeal communities were remarkably different between in situ microaeration and obligate ad process the presence of oxygen enriched relative abundances of deltaproteobacteria anaerolineae clostridia synergistia and caldilineae enabling the acid producing process to metabolize more types of substrates due to the selective enrichment in situ microaeration significantly enriched aceticlastic methanogens rather than hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the ad reactor analysis of coupling microaeration pretreatment and in situ microaeration for anaerobic digestion indicated that excessive microaeration decreased vs removal rate and methane yield owing to substrates consumption by facultative bacteria in situ microaeration based ad could be a promising process for sludge treatment and bioenergy recovery graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microaeration anaerobic digestion methane enzymatic activity microbial community 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad a mature and promising technology 1 2 with enormous developmental potentiality for waste activated sludge was treatment 3 has drawn extensive attentions in recent years for its low cost inputs low investment low energy consumption and low operation 4 and high effect outputs largely was mass and volume reduction effectively carbon footprint mitigation inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms and bioenergy recovery 5 however the anaerobic conversion efficiency of was treatment was of poor quality in china compared with that in developed countries 3 6 because of its low organic matter content 7 and high concentrations of metal ions e g ca2 fe3 al3 and mg2 and grit 50 65 8 the long solid retention time 10 30 days 3 of ad process and insufficient investment for was management 6 further baffled the application and popularization of ad process so the proportion of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps adopting ad technology was only about 2 in china greatly lower than the average ratio above 50 in developed countries 2 to overcome these bottlenecks and make progress of ad effective measures should be taken in terms of technology and management as for the ad process itself three main approaches such as optimization of operational conditions 9 supplement of additives 3 and pretreatment of was have been proposed to improve both efficiency and bioconversion degree of was in fact no matter which method was adopted the strengthening mechanism should be to maintain a balance in kinetics and energy during the four stages hydrolysis acidification acetogenesis methanogenesis of anaerobic reactions so as to improve the overall stability of ad system as well as enhance methane production 1 9 besides the pretreatment methods including physical chemical biological technologies or their combinations 3 5 were also employed to promote hydrolysis rate and improve system stability 10 the additives e g nutrient zero valent iron nanomaterials and conductive materials 3 were used to benefit biogas production from sludge 11 however certain pretreatment processes or supplement of additives usually required additional energy and or chemicals which not only increased operational costs and complexity but also caused a series of environmental problems 12 developing a more environmentally friendly and economically feasible strategy should be taken into consideration recent studies showed that microaeration was more environmentally friendly and cheaper than other pretreatment methods 13 and had advantages of enhancing hydrolysis 12 maintaining low volatile fatty acid vfas concentration 14 and removing h2s from biogas 1 besides the activity of anaerobic bacteria could not be harmfully affected by microaerobic condition owing to the rapid and almost entire consumption of injected o2 15 fu et al 16 found limited oxygen supply significantly increased cellulase activity and cumulative methane production cmp by 10 9 49 0 and 10 2 respectively although previous literatures have studied effects of microaerobic condition on ad of corn straw 17 food waste 18 cellulose and miscanthus 13 etc there was limited information about effects of in situ microaeration on the shift of microbial community structure and enzymatic activity of ad for was so incisive understandings of the mechanisms and microbial metabolism of in situ microaerated ad systems are still needed in this work different oxygen loads were firstly applied to investigate effects of in situ microaeration on the ad performance then enzymatic activity microbial community structure and specific methanogenic activity were investigated to demonstrate the reasons for the elevated ad performance under the circumstance of in situ microaeration lastly in consideration of microaeration pretreatment enhancing methane production yield and rate of ad for was 19 bench scale experiments were conducted to clarify the technical feasibility associated with energy balance and cost estimates for in situ microaeration and its combination with microaeration pretreatment on ad for was 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum mixed sludge ms employed as substrate for this research consisted of 40 primary sludge and 60 was collected from the bailonggang wwtp shanghai china digestion sludge ds served as inoculum was taken from a pilot scale mesophilic digester 35 0 1 0 c with semi continuous feeding of ms acquired from the same source the main features of ms used were as follows volatile solids vs of 23 7 0 9 g l total solids ts of 40 6 1 6 g l total chemical oxygen demand cod of 29 730 1842 mg l soluble cod of 458 11 mg l ammonium nitrogen nh4 n of 58 7 2 6 mg l total organic carbon toc of 133 5 1 4 mg l vfas

identical continuous stirred tank reactors cstr with working volume of 14 l at 35 0 1 0 c fig 1 the test cstr r1 was amended with air at dose of 12 5 phase i and 25 air volume per sludge volume per day ml l d phase ii by in situ microaeration treatment with manual syringe respectively the control cstr r2 was operated as conventional ad without aeration the initial ms was inoculated and acclimated for 40 days then two reactors were continuously operated to verify the effects of in situ microaeration on ad efficiency a wet gas flow meter and an online ph meter were employed to monitor biogas volume and ph the flow rate of ms substrate injected into each reactor was 0 7 l d by a peristaltic pump meanwhile another cstr fed with microaeration pretreated sludge ma reactor was operated to validate effect of ma on ad technology ma was obtained under the optimum conditions 4 air volume per gram ts per minute for 4 h on the basis of our previous research 19 2 3 enzymatic activity determination sludge samples were gathered at days 1 6 12 and 18 to measure hydrolase activities α glucosidase and protease and adenosine triphosphate atp concentrations by elisa kit shanghai hengyuan biotech on the basis of former reported methods 19 2 4 bacterial and archaeal community analysis miseq sequencing was adopted to analyze influences of in situ microaeration on the evolution of bacterial and archaeal community structure of sludge by collecting samples from r1 and r2 at day 20 the detailed experimental procedures of genomic dna extraction pcr amplification 16s rrna gene sequencing biodiversity and phylogenetic analysis could be obtained in ruan et al 19 and hou et al 20 then 16s rrna sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units by setting a distance cut off of 0 03 α 2 5 coupling microaeration pretreatment and in situ microaeration for anaerobic digestion batch assays were carried out at 35 0 1 0 c in 250 ml digester bottles in order to investigate synergistic effects of microaeration pretreatment and in situ microaeration on methane production of ad two different biomass sources collected from r1 and r2 at day 20 were used as inoculums and designated as rs1 and rs2 the detailed design of batch experiments is demonstrated in table 1 firstly four glass bottles were added with 40 ml inoculated sludge and 160 ml substrate sludge respectively then ph was adjusted and maintained at 7 2 0 1 by using 2 m hcl and 2 m naoh lastly all bottles were degassed with nitrogen 99 99 for 10 min to displace air and supply absolutely anaerobic environment before starting the experiment and then incubated at 35 0 1 0 c up to 14 days in a water bath besides a moderate manual stirring for several seconds was carried out for each bottle several times per day for purpose of maintaining sludge homogeneity the production of biogas was quantified volumetrically by water displacement test method with a bottle full of 3 w w naoh solution connected to absorb h2s and co2 2 6 kinetic analysis cmp curves during the batch assays were calculated by fitting the experimental methane production data with modified gompertz equation eq

lag phase time d 2 7 other item analysis the determination of nh4 n cod ts and vs were done in accordance twith standard methods 21 ph was analyzed with a portable ph meter hq30d hach usa toc concentration was determined by a multi n c 3100 analyzer analyti jena germany extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted and stratified to slime eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps according to reported methods 22 23 the concentrations of ps and pn in each eps fraction were monitored following the modified anthrone method and lowry method 24 vfas were measured by a gc 7900p fid gas chromatograph tianmei china the amount of methane was determined by gc tcd equipped with parallel column of 1 1 m 3 16 molsieve 137 and 0 7 m 1 4 chromosorb 108 specific resistance to filtrate srf was measured by pressure filtration method capillary suction time cst was analyzed by a portable cst 304b instrument triton uk the particle size distribution was monitored with an sald 2201 laser diffraction particle size analyzer shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 semi continuous flow experiment fig 2 demonstrates the changes of specific biogas yield and vs removal efficiency in the semi continuous flow anaerobic reactors with without in situ microaeration as shown in fig 2a the specific biogas yield fluctuated in the two reactors mainly because of varied organic matter contents and characteristics of ms collecting from the real wwtps the contribution of injected air to the specific gas yield was about 0 7 0 2 compared to r2 for control in situ microaeration increased the average specific biogas yield by 15 8 7 3 with air dosage ranging from 0 to 12 5 ml l d the specific biogas yield increased gradually in phase ii because the organic matter content of ms increased in winter in this stage the average specific biogas yield of r1 138 7 29 6 ml g vs was 13 1 6 7 higher than that of r2 123 3 28 8 ml g vs the results suggested that high oxygen supply did not further improve the specific biogas yield because higher aeration intensity might inhibit the activity of methanogens increase the oxidation of intermediate soluble products and then reduce methane yield 18 correspondingly the average vs removal of r1 in phase i and ii were 24 9 1 5 and 23 0 1 5 respectively both higher than those of r2 18 3 1 6 and 17 9 0 9 the average specific biogas yield of ma reactor fed with microaeration pretreated sludge was 135 4 22 4 ml g vs which was 11 7 2 4 higher than that of the control reactor fed with raw sludge in this sense enhancement for biogas production of ad by in situ microaeration was slightly superior to that by microaeration pretreatment 3 2 variation of eps and sludge properties as an intricate mixture of polymers eps are main ingredients of was floc matrix and play a crucial role in sludge flocculation sedimentation compression and dewaterability 25 as shown in table 2 in situ microaeration led to remarkable changes in the production of slime eps lb eps and tb eps compared with r2 the total concentrations of pn and ps in slime eps and lb eps for sludge discharged from r1 both decreased while those in tb eps increased yuan and wang 26 revealed a notable connection between sludge reduction and the degradation of tb eps and cell lysis the lower contents of ps and pn in tb eps for sludge discharged from r2 indicated that in situ microaeration motivated cell breakup and then led to the diffusion of eps from inner layer to outer layer especially through the disintegration of pn in tb eps 27 the pn ps ratio for sludge discharged from r1 ranged from 5 2 to 5 6 whereas that for sludge discharged from r2 varied from 2 3 to 4 6 eps with relatively high pn content would be hydrolyzed to serve as carbon and energy source for gas production 28 to ease the shortage of nutrient in substrate compared to r2 srf and cst of sludge discharged from r1 decreased by 14 7 and 14 0 table 2 indicating that dewaterability of ms improved by in situ microaeration better sludge dewaterability of an ad process operated under microaerobic condition was also reported by jenicek et al 29 a higher pn ps ratio of sludge discharged from r1 could be associated with well dewatering capacity along with hydrophobicity 30 moreover lb eps and tb eps were reported to play a vital role in dominating sludge dewaterability lb tb eps ratio for sludge discharged from r1 0 18 were lower than that from r2 0 30 supporting the enhancement of sludge dewaterability by in situ microaeration 23 the decreased lb tb eps ratio also manifested the strengthening of flocs structure and the improvement of sludge aggregation this result was in accordance with a clear increased particle size of sludge in r1 compared with r2 table 2 3 3 influence of in situ microaeration over enzymatic activity protease and α glucosidase main extracellular hydrolase in sludge mixture play a central role in degrading soluble pn and ps into small molecular organic matters such as amino acids and monosaccharide 7 as the universal energy currency of biological realm atp generated via substrate level phosphorylation 1 can be served as an indicator of biological activity and viable biomass in biological studies 22 during the whole operation period fig 3 activities of protease glucosidase and atp of raw ms had a small fluctuation and were maintained at 11 4 1 3 1 7 0 2 and 9 6 1 8 iu g vss the maximum values of protease α glucosidase and atp were achieved in r1 reaching 33 0 5 1 and 26 0 iu g vss on day 1 which were 2 5 2 2 and 2 9 times of those in r2 these results indicated that in situ microaeration enhanced secretion of hydrolase accelerated energetic conversions of intermediates to sustain overall stability in ad processes and finally improved the ad efficiency 1 besides in situ microaerobic condition could also be a promising tactic to facilitate the generation of atp and enhance the specific microbial activity which had a bearing on the release of organic matters by the higher cell lysis rate in r1 31 3 4 comparison on microbial community structures 3 4 1 bacterial community fig 4 depicts the bacterial composition of the two sludge samples collected from r1 and r2 at phylum and class levels although most abundant bacterial phyla were similar in two sludge samples the relative abundances differed from each other as shown in fig 4a proteobacteria 29 40 34 89 chloroflexi 13 41 21 24 bacteroidetes 6 57 12 17 actinobacteria 6 17 7 36 acidobacteria 4 93 5 68 firmicutes 3 42 3 97 aminicenantes 3 59 3 72 saccharibacteria 3 02 3 93 ws6 2 81 4 02 synergistetes 2 47 2 26 and parcubacteria 1 24 2 68 were the most dominant phyla in each sample among these dominant phyla relative abundances of four phyla playing prominent roles in hydrolysis and hydrogenogenic acidogenesis during ad of sludge 32 chloroflexi firmicutes synergistetes and parcubacteria in r1 were 58 4 16 1 3 4 and 116 3 higher than those in r2 chloroflexi was reported as one of the numerically important glucose degrading bacterial groups responsible for acidogenesis and h2 oxidizing homoacetogenesis in ad process 33 and could utilize various carbohydrates and amino acids as substrates 34 the relative abundances of these phyla confirmed the increase in protease and α glucosidase production fig 3 under microaerobic condition which could enhance hydrolysis of proteins and other complex organic substrates firmicutes had this ability of secreting extracellular enzymes closely related to the metabolism of protein lipids cellulose and hemicelluloses 34 firmicutes was also associated with the bioconversion of ps to butyric propionic and acetic acids 35 and had the thick cell wall to produce endospores for survival in extreme conditions 36 higher relative abundance of firmicutes in r1 meant greater ability to degrade complex substrate leading to higher hydrolysis rate under in situ microaerobic condition 17 synergistetes was notable to ferment ps to acetate and h2 37 parcubacteria principally fermented simple sugars to organic acids and some species also had the ability of degrading complex carbon sources 38 relatively higher abundance of the above mentioned phyla signified that efficient hydrolysis fermentation and acidogenesis were acquired in the anaerobic digester upon in situ microaeration 39 the bacteria diversity at the class level in fig 4b demonstrates more information on microbial community evolution between r1 and r2 alphaproteobacteria 8 8 9 1 betaproteobacteria 6 9 12 0 gammaproteobacteria 8 0 8 9 and deltaproteobacteria 4 9 5 6 affiliated to phylum proteobacteria and functioned as dominating consumers of vfas and glucose 19 were the predominant four classes followed by actinobacteria 6 2 7 4 acidobacteria 4 9 5 7 anaerolineae 5 4 8 6 clostridia 2 4 2 7 aminicenantes 3 6 3 7 synergistia 2 5 2 6 and caldilineae 1 9 2 9 in comparison to r2 relative abundances of deltaproteobacteria anaerolineae clostridia synergistia and caldilineae in r1 increased by 14 5 57 9 13 6 3 4 and 55 4 respectively most deltaproteobacteria were well known as acetate butyrate propionate and glucose utilizing microbial communities 40 anaerolineae and caldilineae were in charge of hydrolysis and fermentation of organic matters 20 and are members of phylum chloroflexi discovered to be essential for glucose utilization 40 clostridia the main bacterial class of phylum firmicutes could utilize various carbohydrates and transform complex macromolecules into simple products 41 compared to obligate anaerobic condition hydrolysis fermentation and acidogenesis under the presence of oxygen in the anaerobic digester gave rise to the relative abundances of deltaproteobacteria anaerolineae clostridia synergistia and caldilineae which will enable the acid producing process to metabolize more types of substrates 3 4 2 archaeal community fig 5 displays the composition of archaeal community in r1 and r2 at class and genus levels as can be seen from fig 5a the dominant classes detected in r1 and r2 were aceticlastic hydrogenotrophic methanomicrobia and hydrogenotrophic methanobacteria which in total composed 97 1 r1 and 96 4 r2 of the entire archaeal community respectively although the first two dominant classes in r1 and r2 did not shift in situ microaeration caused a significant decrease of methanobacteria 27 8 for r1 and 45 1 for r2 but enriched methanomicrobia 69 3 for r1 and 51 3 for r2 42 as illustrated in fig 5b the obligate aceticlastic methanogenic genus methanosaeta and the obligate hydrogenotrophic methanogenic genus methanobacterium 42 43 were dominant in r1 and r2 with total relative abundances of 94 0 r1 and 93 4 r2 respectively the relative abundances of methanosaeta and methanobacterium were 67 6 and 26 4 in r1 and 49 0 and 44 4 in r2 indicating that in situ microaeration in r1 favored the growth of methanosaeta but prejudiced methanobacterium kiener and leisinger 44 also demonstrated that longer periods of contact with oxygen could damage the viability of methanobacterium these results also indicated that the main methanogenic pathway in r1 was aceticlastic methanogenesis zheng and raskin 45 reported that methanosaeta species were also observed to be the predominant archaea in a variety of anaerobic reactors at low acetate concentrations but their numbers decreased fast as the acetate concentration increased however in the presence of a small amount of oxygen acetic acid reacts with oxygen to maintain a dynamic equilibrium of acetic acid concentration thus maintaining the higher activity and relative abundance of methanosaeta 46 as a typical hydrogenotrophic methanogen 47 methanobrevibacter was reported to utilize h2 co2 or formate as substrates 48 and existed in two sludge samples with low abundance ranging from 0 69 to 1 3 overall the proportions of archaeal community in r1 changed significantly compared to r2 because of the in situ microaeration which significantly promoted enrichment of aceticlastic methanogens in ad reactor rather than hydrogenotrophic methanogens 3 5 energy balance and cost estimates for in situ microaeration and its combination with microaeration pretreatment for ad in situ microaeration was found to be a valid method to enhance biogas production and vs removal efficiency fig 2 besides in consideration of microaeration pretreatment strengthening methane production yield and rate 19 bench scale experiments were implemented to investigate the techno economic feasibility associated with the estimated energy balance and cost of in situ microaeration and its combination with microaeration pretreatment on ad of was fig 6 describes variations of cmp and vs removal of raw ms and ma with inoculated sludge from r1 and r2 on day 14 the cmp obtained under various experimental conditions was in the following sequence of ms rs1 100 7 ml g vs ma rs1 88 6 ml g vs ma rs2 80 9 ml g vs ms rs2 64 0 ml g vs fig 6a the determined cmp was then regressed with the modified gompertz equation eq 1 using non linear regression algorithm in originpro 8 1 and the fitting results are displayed in table 1 the results illustrate a well fit to experimental cmp data r 2 0 9999 compared to ms rs2 microaerobic condition brought the change of p by 69 0 46 7 and 33 5 and of r m by 54 9 55 9 and 60 8 for ms rs1 ma rs1 and ma rs2 respectively showing that microaerobic condition enhanced cmp but decreased the methane production rate fig 6b shows the average removal efficiency among different combination after 14 days in the sequence of ms rs1 44 4 2 8 ma rs1 36 0 2 2 ma rs2 33 1 1 4 ms rs2 28 1 2 6 the trend of vs removal accorded well with the cmp the above results indicated that enhancement in hydrolysis and acidogenesis under in situ microaeration might generate more substrates for methanogens leading to higher specific methanogenic activity and final methane yield in ad process 1 while coupling microaeration pretreatment and in situ microaeration decreased not only specific biogas yield but also vs removal efficiency in comparison to in situ microaeration alone for sludge ad in all above applications of microaeration it should need to consider the substrate competition between facultative bacteria and anaerobic methanogens in order to acquire strengthened digestion while preventing entire reduction in methane yield due to consumption of substrates by facultative bacteria 1 it is estimated that 1 kg ch4 can generate electricity for a capacity of 5 13 kwh 49 therefore compared with ms rs2 the enhanced methane yields for in situ microaeration ms rs1 microaeration pretreatment ma rs2 and combination treatment ma rs1 generated electricity of 0 111 0 051 and 0 074 kwh kg vs meanwhile microaeration saved costs of sludge treatment and disposal by 0 0152 0 0047 and 0 0074 kg vs for ms rs1 ma rs2 and ma rs1 by improving vs digestion with typical investment of 218 ton dried solids 50 so the total investment reduced by microaeration was 0 0223 0 0079 and 0 0122 kg vs considering the power consumption of 0 13 kwh microaeration pretreatment and 0 0012 kwh in situ microaeration 4 conclusion this research supplied perceptions into performance microbial community and mechanism of an innovative mesophilic ad process under in situ microaeration treatment in situ microaeration obtained a 15 8 7 3 gain in average specific biogas yield and a 37 1 12 1 increase in vs removal efficiency at 12 5 ml l d air dosage compared to the obligate ad process in situ microaeration stimulated activity of hydrolytic enzymes enlarged sludge particle size and improved sludge dewaterability however excessive air dosage of 25 ml l d decreased both specific biogas yield and vs removal efficiency remarkable differences in dominant bacterial and archaeal species were observed between the in situ microaeration and the obligate ad processes the methanogenic genus methanosaeta 67 6 predominated the archaeal community in the in situ microaeration ad process and facilitated the accelerated degradation of diverse substrates via aceticlastic pathway techno economic analysis associated with energy balance and cost estimates for in situ microaeration and its combination with microaeration pretreatment for ad also indicated that excessive microaeration could cause reduction in methane yield and vs removal efficiency owing to substrates consumption by facultative bacteria declaration of

13478,textile industries consume huge amount of water which is more than that is consumed by most of the other industries wastewater generated from textile industries contains high concentrations of pollutants thus the wastewater needs to be treated before discharging besides since large amount of wastewater is produced reuse of treated wastewater should be considered in environmental aspects since textile wastewater contains mainly dyestuffs it must be treated effectively using environmentally friendly technologies membrane processes are widely used in textile wastewater treatment as they have distinct advantages over conventional wastewater treatment methods most of the research done so far has been conducted in lab scale but gradually both pilot and full scale systems have been applied this review provides a comprehensive view of the treatment of textile wastewater and its reuse after proper treatment by membrane technologies at both pilot and full scale applications for this purpose physical and biological treatment methods were examined separately as a result of the examination it was observed that according to the characteristics of textile wastewater and discharge standards hybrid systems were generally used in the literature and very good results were obtained in terms of both filtration and treatment performance besides cleaning methods and economic feasibility for the membrane processes are also investigated in textile wastewater treatment furthermore due to the fact that full scale studies are less in comparison to pilot scale studies deficiencies in processes are mentioned in order to support future research studies keywords economic feasibility industrial wastewater treatment membrane process textile industry water reuse 1 introduction water is the most valuable and indispensable natural resource of the life 71 of the earth s surface is covered with water 97 5 of this amount is salt water and the rest is freshwater 1 requirement of water consumption in daily life is mainly supplied from fresh water resources 2 however with the increase in population in recent years there has been a serious increase in water demand for domestic consumption and agricultural and industrial applications 3 as a result of this increase protection of water resources has become very important to avoid water shortages in the future 4 several precautions can be taken to protect the water resources one of the most important precautions is the reuse of treated wastewater due to increasing demand for additional water resources 5 due to the insufficient water resources in industrial zones and or the low quality of existing water resources especially in these regions protection of water resources and water reuse facilities should be widely applied 6 one of the highest water consumer industries is the textile industry the amount of water used to process 1 ton of product in the textile industry is averagely between 230 and 270 tons 7 based on the world bank report approximately 20 of the wastewater generated from the industries is contributed from the textile industry 8 natural fibers such as cotton linen wool silk and fabricated fibers such as casein acetate cellulose ester nylon polyester acrylic and vinyl are produced in the textile industry in general yarn making weaving preparation and finishing of products are involved in this sector 9 since the yarn making and weaving preparation parts are dry processes the most of the water is consumed during finishing processes major finishing processes are sizing knitting desizing washing bleaching mercerization charring dyeing 10 wastewater generated from finishing processes contains non degradable organic materials toxic substances surfactants organic halogens and heavy metals 11 in addition this wastewater is generally rich in color chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolved solids tds and salinity 12 in particular the dyeing process accounts for more than 80 of the total produced wastewater 7 therefore the most important constituent of the textile wastewater is dye that contains soluble and insoluble fractions dyestuffs can be classified as basic acidic direct reactive azo disperse sulfur enhanced dyes and aniline black 13 the presence of dyes in water resources results in a threat for both environment and human health dyes in wastewater are harmful to human health due to their carcinogenic and mutagenic properties 4 besides they disrupt the balance in the ecosystem by reducing dissolved oxygen as a result of blocking the sunlight 1 due to high amount of water use in the production stages the textile industry needs to effectively treat its wastewater and should reuse the treated water in the production process 7 however since the removal of dyes from wastewater is not an easy process several treatment methods have been tested to date 14 the applied methods reported in the literature for treatment of textile wastewaters included physical chemical and biological processes 8 adsorption ion exchange and membrane processes have been applied as physical processes 15 17 while chemical coagulation electrocoagulation and oxidation have been applied as chemical processes 18 biological methods have been applied as aerobic and anaerobic processes 18 20 physical methods are relatively simple and low cost but they are known to have large amounts of concentrated sludge as the final product although chemical methods are effective in treatment generally they are costly and produce excessive sludge including toxic substances 21 however electrocoagulation is an intensively used hybrid system which is easy to apply and produces less sludge 22 biological processes are complex to manage are quickly affected by external factors and require large footprint 4 but these methods cannot sufficiently meet discharge standards as a result legal wastewater discharge limits are tightened every year and wastewater purification has become a huge issue for the textile industry 23 considering all of the treatment alternatives membrane technology is one of the most sustainable and widely applied technologies in textile wastewater treatment 12 24 25 also in recent years membrane technology can be a good option for treating textile dye wastewater because narrow pore sizes of membranes can eliminate dye compounds and discharge high quality effluent many studies have been performed for removing dyes with membranes technologies 23 membrane technology is one of the best methods in terms of novelty efficiency and purity for obtaining desired water quality for water reuse 23 membrane process is an advanced treatment technology which covers low space and is easy to apply enabling recovery of chemicals as well as water reuse 10 membranes that are used wastewater treatment are classified as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro mf membranes have been used in dye and wash baths containing pigment dyes to remove colloidal dyes 12 26 it could also be used as pre treatment to prevent membrane fouling 22 uf membranes have been generally applied to recover high molecular weight substances auxiliary chemicals and direct indigo disperse and reactive dyes 27 28 in addition uf effluent could be reused in the rinsing and washing processes in the textile industry 29 nf membranes separate organic compounds divalent salts and hydrolyzed reactive dyes presented in wastewaters 30 whereas ro membranes can retain all mineral salts and hydrolyzed reactive dyes 31 membrane coupled biological processes e g membrane bioreactors mbrs produce less sludge adapt to more pollutant concentrations and occupy less space compared to other biological wastewater treatment methods 2 32 mbrs could remove both azo dyes and aromatic amines from textile wastewaters 33 membrane distillation md is an emerging thermal based membrane technology capable of treating a wide variety of feed water including high salinity brine and wastewater 34 although the use of membrane distillation technology in textile wastewater treatment has many advantages such as low electrical energy consumption complete elimination of non volatile solutes and ambient operating pressures it has been less studied in the literature compared to other processes 35 the high operating temperatures used in most textile dyeing mills mean that there is available waste heat that can be used to recycle water in one step through md the use of synthetic wastewater containing the predominant components of real wastewater namely dyes surfactants and salts was chosen to avoid any unknown variation from the actual samples 34 the main purposes of this review are i to investigate pilot and full scale studies conducted on the treatment of textile wastewater by membrane technology both physically and biologically ii examine cleaning methods which is important for fouling control iii investigate economic analysis of the membrane systems treating textile wastewater iv guide future studies with the available data in this review only pilot and full scale membrane applications for the treatment of textile wastewater were discussed including treatment and filtration performances in the application part both physical and biological studies are examined and summarized in detail the clogging and cleaning methods of the membranes used in the studies and their economic analysis were also examined in addition it was aimed to highlight needs for future research based on the current studies 2 historical development studies on the treatment of textile wastewater with membrane processes gained importance due to the advantages of these processes the major advantages are high quality of permeate production possibility to reuse of treated water within the textile production process small footprint and materials recovery since 1975 considering the analysis done by using scopus database 486 research papers and 23 review papers have been conducted on textile wastewater treatment since 1991 with the addition of membrane processes to the research topic then 117 research papers and 7 review papers have been conducted in addition the publications of the studies are increasing rapidly as can be seen in fig 1 effects of several parameters on the performance and morphology of membrane processes treating textile wastewaters have been studied at lab scale in the early studies 36 38 after adequate information has been gained at lab scale applications pilot and full scale systems have been investigated based on the literature studies it was determined that there were less studies performed at pilot and full scale in comparison to the lab scale applications fig 2 39 by examining pilot scale studies it can be understood whether full scale systems will work correctly and whether there will be performance losses engineering strategies should be implemented to ensure that full scale facilities can be applied at low cost and provide environment friendly treatment with high efficiency 40 membrane processes could be successfully enlarged when transitioning from lab scale to pilot and or full scale and it was also reported that membrane performance could be improved at larger scale applications 41 3 applications 3 1 pilot scale applications producing process water from wastewater by using membrane processes is a challenging task in the textile industry in order to achieve this wastewater characterization should be examined optimum technology and operating conditions should be determined and feasibility study should be carried out 31 pilot scale studies on both physical and biological membrane treatment systems in the literature were investigated in detail in the following sections treatment and filtration performances of pilot scale membrane processes used in the treatment of various types of textile wastewater are presented in table 1 3 1 1 physical treatment physical membrane treatment applications include mf uf nf and ro processes these processes can be applied both as the main treatment process and pre treatment process which is mainly applied in order to increase the efficiency of the whole treatment plant schematic illustration of physical treatment is presented in fig 3 pre treatment of textile wastewater generated from printing dyeing and rinsing units by uf process decreased cod concentration remarkably and protected the following nf process from fouling the reason for the fouling was due to dissolved inorganic and organic compounds 28 nf membrane provided more than 90 cod removal 90 color removal and 80 conductivity removal efficiencies in the study the flux of nf membrane was kept as 145 l m2 h at 15 bar 28 considering this study obtaining high quality permeate and reuse of the treated water in production processes of the textile industry were found appropriate 28 alcaina miranda et al 2009 investigated the treatment of textile wastewaters by uf and nf processes 42 spiral wound uf membrane module was used for pre treatment to remove large particles and thus avoid the fouling of nf membrane cod turbidity and color removal efficiencies were 64 76 95 99 and 75 by uf process respectively following uf two types of nf membranes including nf270 and nf 8040f were used for treatment of textile wastewaters generated from finishing unit the highest removal performance was achieved by nf270 membrane during this study membrane flux was maintained at 88 104 l m2 h and the transmembrane pressure tmp fluctuated between 8 and 10 bar 42 kurt et al 2012 investigated the treatment of textile wastewaters by nf and ro processes 31 the system had cartridge filters 5 μm and 1 μm string wound to remove suspended solids ss prior to nf and ro processes when nf and ro membrane performances were compared it was observed that ro process achieved better performance in terms of removal efficiency in both batch and continuous systems in the study it was reported that the fluxes of nf and ro membranes were 45 and 26 l m2 h at 6 and 20 bar respectively also when the membrane fouling experiments in the study were examined it was observed that irreversible fouling was 23 for nf membrane and 25 for ro membrane over the 5 days 31 barredo damas et al 2012 studied on the treatment of textile mill wastewaters by a ceramic membrane having an active layer of zirconium dioxide titanium dioxide zro2 tio2 and a support layer of tio2 cartridge filters 30 μm pleated and 5 μm string wound were used as pre treatment to remove big particles for avoiding membrane fouling which is reversible fouling for this process 29 different operational conditions were investigated by changing pressure between 1 and 4 5 bar and ph between 8 and 12 it was found that an increase in both ph and pressure resulted in an increase in cod ss and conductivity removal efficiencies a flux of 120 l m2 h was applied in the study at 2 bar considering this study ph and pressure were found to be important parameters that affect membrane performance for treatment of textile wastewaters 29 membrane applications can be used as a post treatment after a biological treatment process in which the pollutant load is high or the treatment is not sufficient bes pia et al 2009 applied activated sludge process and three different nf membranes to treat textile wastewater 27 since the activated sludge process did not provide required treated wastewater quality for reuse in the textile factory nf unit was added to the system as a post treatment process 27 in another study biological activated sludge process was used as a pre treatment method followed by membrane filtration processes uf ro for treatment of wastewaters from dyeing and finishing units in a textile factory in the study uf ro system was used as a hybrid system to reuse the treated textile wastewater in the textile factory conductivity cod and color removal efficiencies of 99 76 and 95 were obtained by the hybrid process respectively in the hybrid system flux of uf membrane was 25 l m2 h at 4 bar while flux of ro membrane was 9 3 l m2 h at 8 bar uf ro process was an effective hybrid system for the treatment of textile wastewater and reuse of treated water 43 tavangar et al 2019 applied electrocoagulation and nf processes for treatment of textile industry wastewater 8 since using electrocoagulation or membrane filtration alone was not sufficient to achieve required treatment performance nf was used following in electrocoagulation process turbidity cod and color removal efficiencies of 99 64 94 were achieved by the electrocoagulation process and removal efficiencies of 99 74 87 for the same parameters were achieved by the nf process respectively flux of nf membrane was kept as 50 l m2 h at 10 bar also it has been observed that membrane fouling of the nf membrane was irreversible in electrocoagulation process it has been observed that the membrane fouling depends on the type of electrode and if the al electrode is used the fouling was reversible 8 3 1 2 biological treatment onto membrane reactor performance of mbr systems treating textile wastewaters depends on many factors such as wastewater characteristics operational conditions membrane type and membrane configuration schematic illustration of biological treatment is presented in fig 4 yigit et al 2009 investigated the treatment of wastewaters from a denim producing textile industry containing 400 different dyes by an mbr process 44 experiments were carried out at mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 15 5 g l food to mass ratio f m ratio of 0 05 kg cod kg mlss day organic loading rate olr of 0 65 kg cod m3 day and hydraulic retention time hrt of 14 days considering the results of the study mbr process was found better in comparison to the conventional activated sludge system turbidity cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solid tss and color removal efficiencies of 99 8 97 4 96 7 97 6 and 97 8 were achieved by the mbr process the most important mechanisms of dye removal in mbr systems were biodegradation and sorption onto solids besides it was reported that permeate of the mbr process had potential to be reused in sizing dyeing and finishing units in the textile industries 44 luong et al 2016 investigated the treatment of textile wastewaters containing two different dyes and various salts by an mbr system 45 since the dyes and membrane surface were negatively charged charged exclusion mechanism was expected to occur the operating conditions of the mbr system in this study were applied as follows mlss concentration was 14 g l f m ratio was 0 2 kg cod kg mlss day olr was 1 4 kg cod m3 day and hrt was 65 h cod and color removal efficiencies of 95 and 80 were achieved by the mbr process in addition azo dyes presented in the wastewater had low biodegradability under aerobic conditions however mbr system applied without pre treatment provided high quality permeate which was appropriate for reuse in the industry 45 in some cases since only an mbr process does not provide the desired water quality enabling reuse hybrid mbr systems can be used to increase the removal efficiency of organics and color therefore several researchers have recently placed more emphasis on discovering the operational advantages of the hybrid processes based on the fact that each dye removal process has its own advantages and disadvantages a combination of different techniques can be used to achieve more efficient dye removal from wastewater cinperi et al 2019 investigated the treatment of textile wastewaters from woolen fabric production textile mill industry by different processes e g mbr mbr nf and mbr ro 46 basket type of fine screen was used as a pre treatment to remove solid substances conductivity turbidity cod and color removal were obtained as 11 4 99 70 and 62 by the mbr process 35 98 97 and 80 by the mbr nf process and 97 99 99 and 85 by the mbr ro process respectively following the results since only mbr process was not sufficient to achieve a high quality permeate nf or ro process should be used following the mbr process flux of nf membrane and ro membrane was applied as 10 l m2 h at 5 bar and 13 l m2 h at 12 bar respectively 46 3 2 full scale applications full scale studies in the literature are examined in this section treatment and filtration performances of the full scale membrane processes treating various textile wastewater types are presented in table 2 3 2 1 physical treatment generally uf and nf processes are mostly used for the treatment of textile wastewater pre treatment can also be applied in order to increase the treatment and filtration performance tahri et al 2012 investigated the treatment of dyeing wastewater which includes different dyes chemical substances and caustic soda by mf nf system 7 color turbidity ss conductivity and cod removal efficiencies were achieved as 97 2 99 5 100 42 4 and 75 5 respectively in the study the flux of mf membrane was 163 5 l m2 h at 2 bar and the flux of nf membrane was 45 l m2 h at 6 bar in addition when membrane fouling studies were examined it was observed that the fouling was irreversible and this was related to the interactions between nf and wastewater loads following the results of this study mf nf system was found effective for the treatment of textile wastewater in order to reuse it as process water 7 fersi et al 2008 investigated the application of uf nf processes for treatment of biologically treated textile wastewaters 48 uf tubular porous ceramic membrane module was used as a pre treatment step prior to nf membrane to remove big particles nf process was applied with and without uf pre treatment to evaluate the treatment performance uf nf combination provided better results in terms of removal efficiency in comparison to application of only nf process flux of nf membrane was 85 l m2 h at 11 bar 48 moreover sahinkaya et al 2019 investigated the treatment of wastewaters generated from an industrial area where 65 textile companies are located by using uf process as pre treatment followed by ro membrane systems 49 the reason of using uf was to remove the solids and to decrease the load fed to the ro process three recirculation methods including recirculation of only concentrate recirculation of both permeate and concentrate and 70 permeate recirculation were tested however no visible difference was observed among them conductivity color and cod removal efficiencies were found as 98 93 and 76 respectively for each mode flux of ro membrane was kept as 19 l m2 h at 8 bar 49 uf and electrodialysis processes were used for the treatment of cotton fabric primary treated textile wastewater by lafi et al 2018 uf process was used to remove macromolecules colloids and color electrodialysis was used to separate the ionic species two types of operation mode with only uf process and uf ed combination was investigated in this study according to the results of this study uf ed system was found more effective compared to uf process for treatment of the textile wastewater with uf ed system conductivity turbidity and cod removal efficiencies were found as 97 100 and 77 respectively in the study flux of uf membrane was applied as 150 l m2 h at 5 bar in addition the cause of membrane fouling was explained as adsorption of organic pollutants on the membrane surface and into the pores 12 moreover nandy et al 2007 investigated the treatment of wastewater from a textile processing industry including fabric dyeing and printing 50 two different pre treatment processes including chlorination multi grade filter and dechlorination antiscalant dosing prior to uf and ro processes respectively have been tested color and ss were completely removed by this system 50 in another study coagulation and flocculation processes were applied as for pre treatment purpose prior to nf process treating woolen textile wastewater with an increase in both pressure from 4 to 8 bar and ph from 6 to 10 a decrease in the turbidity removal efficiency from 72 9 to 67 4 and an increase in the cod removal efficiency from 91 5 to 96 1 were observed flux of nf membrane was applied as 54 l m2 h at 9 bar they mentioned that pre treatment with coagulation and flocculation processes which was followed by the nf process could be a promising alternative for the reuse of treated textile wastewaters 11 3 2 2 biological treatment onto membrane bioreactor biological treatment can be applied for the treatment of textile wastewaters which results in an efficient removal of cod total nitrogen ammonium nitrate and nitrite especially mbr treatment is an efficient method for treating textile wastewaters with a focus on color removal 44 de jager et al 2014 studied the treatment of textile wastewater using uf dual stage mbr ro system 30 cod turbidity color and conductivity removal efficiencies were obtained as 75 94 28 6 and 28 6 respectively by the mbr process although the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant was sufficient for discharge standards by using sole mbr system ro treatment was applied to remove residual color and conductivity removal efficiencies of cod turbidity color and conductivity were 87 97 95 and 93 respectively by the mbr ro system 30 moreover li et al 2020 studied the treatment of textile wastewater by mbr nf process after anaerobic treatment the mbr incorporated a membrane module containing forty pieces of flat sheet uf membrane with an effective volume of 1 5 m3 32 experiments were carried out at mlss concentration of 8 93 g l f m ratio of 0 87 kg cod kg mlss day olr of 34 76 g cod m3 day and hrt of 12 h mbr process provided cod turbidity and color removal efficiencies of 75 4 99 and 59 2 respectively when nf process was used after the mbr process removal efficiencies of cod turbidity and color increased up to 97 3 99 6 and 96 5 respectively enabling suitable permeate quality for reuse in the process 32 overall it can be stated that mbr process is much more effective in comparison to other systems such as conventional activated sludge process and permeate obtained by an mbr process has high potential for reuse inside the textile industry 44 4 cleaning methods for membrane applications in textile wastewater treatment fouling is commonly defined as the accumulation of unwanted material on solid surfaces with an associated detriment of function the types of fouling that can occur in membrane systems can be divided into four categories inorganic salt scaling or precipitation fouling particulate fouling biological fouling and chemical membrane degradation 51 membrane fouling is one of the most important problems of membrane processes as it reduces permeate flux and thus affects its selectivity 25 fouling may be caused by dissolved inorganic or organic compounds colloids bacteria and or ss 7 28 however different cleaning methods can be applied since the fouling type may differ according to the membrane processes operational conditions sludge properties and configurations 52 53 generally when flux decreases or transmembrane pressure increases the membrane should be cleaned or replaced 52 membrane cleaning is routinely performed to ensure stable operation over time the frequency with which cleaning operations are performed depends on a variety of factors including the type of separation process involved feedwater quality process conditions membrane design and others 34 membrane cleaning processes are classified as physical and chemical methods cleaning of the cake layer accumulated on the membrane surface by using hydraulic mechanical or electrical force application is called physical cleaning process 54 these can include air backwashing aeration vibration ultrasound and water flushing although compared to chemical techniques these have been less widely explored in the literature backwashing is a commonly used cleaning method for pressure driven membrane processes and is widely used in membrane bioreactors mbrs aeration employs the shear forces imparted by air bubbles onto the membrane surface to reduce fouling layer 34 in order to remove foulants from the membrane surface turbulence is increased in hydraulic and mechanical cleaning besides voltage can be applied to the membrane surface in electrical cleaning method 54 physical cleaning processes commonly remove reversible fouling such as cake layer and deposited solids reversible fouling reduces productivity and increases operational cost also physical cleaning is not as effective as chemical cleaning and does not require any chemical reagents 7 53 the ideal chemical cleaning method is to remove all dirt and limestone from the membrane surface recovering 100 of the initial distillation flow and preventing pore wetting without affecting the mechanical stability of the membrane in practice chemical cleaning regains only a fraction of the original performance of the membrane and may be required every few months or more at the expense of the membrane s life 34 chemical cleaning is generally applied in situ especially with alkaline and acidic solutions by using chemical cleaning method especially the formation of a gel layer on the membrane surface and the irreversible fouling caused the pore clogging could be eliminated 53 acid cleaning especially cleaning with hcl is one of the most common methods used for dirty membrane remediation in md systems acid cleaning is performed as a batch process by replacing the feed water with an acidic solution it is known that the effectiveness of acid washing varies considerably depending on the type of contamination it has been found that alkaline solutions that are more soluble at lower ph are removed very effectively by acid scrubbing including the most common lime caco3 51 in addition ultrasonic cleaning is one of the unconventional methods by using frequency sound waves to remove adherents on the membrane 54 high frequency vibrations cause cavitation the formation of small vapour filled bubbles in the surrounding liquid when these cavities collapse or implode they generate shockwaves which produce a physical force capable of dislodging weakly attached particles from surfaces 34 the main advantage of this method is that the cleaning method can be applied while the filtration continues without stopping the system 54 generally the reason for fouling of membranes used in textile wastewater is fouling layer on the membrane surface 55 a common problem of membrane fouling caused by textile wastewater being colored water is the thin gel like dye layer on the upper surface of the membrane however the fouling layer can be easily washed off by physically flushing fresh water without using any chemicals 56 for example li et al 2020 conducted studies to make membranes used in textile wastewater treatment electro cleanable as a result of this study they observed that after 5 min of electrical cleaning most of the contaminants on the membrane surface were degraded by electro catalysis and the membrane surface was cleaned after electro cleaning it was found that the permeable flux recovery rate was more than 90 57 ong et al 2014 examined that fouling and chemical membrane cleaning procedures in textile wastewater treatment 21 membrane flux was measured at different time intervals and when the flux dropped to 80 of the initial flux it was considered that the membrane was contaminated and chemical washing was required the membrane was cleaned first with an alkaline solution then with an acidic solution and washed with distilled water this process took 30 min and membrane contamination was eliminated 21 according to the studies of de lara et al 2012 and lafi et al 2018 membrane filtration performance was improved after a chemical washing process 12 25 in the first stage the membrane surface was cleaned with distilled water for 15 min then an alkaline cleaning process was carried out for 1 h after this process the membrane surface was washed again with distilled water then the fluxes were examined and it was observed that cleaning process was not enough to enhance membrane filtration performance so cleaning with acidic solution was applied for 1 more hour followed by rinsing with distilled water no pressure was applied during these processes the water flux was checked to ensure membrane filtration performance and a flux recovery of 90 was observed 12 25 moreover in the study of li et al 2020 the cleaning methods of both mbr and nf membranes after treatment of textile wastewater were investigated 32 when tmp of the mbr system exceeded 20 kpa chemical washing was performed with sodium hypochlorite and citric acid followed by an aeration for 6 h without any wastewater coming into the system in addition alkaline and acidic cleaning was performed for the nf membrane and the surface was washed with distilled water then the nf membrane was soaked in deionized water for 24 h and prepressed under 12 bar for at least 2 h to ensure a steady structure before each experiment to eliminate contamination as a result of chemical cleaning performances of both mbr and nf processes were improved 32 5 economic feasibility of membrane processes for textile wastewater treatment besides the performance of the membrane applications for treatment of textile wastewaters their economic feasibility is also very important especially for the pilot and full scale plants in the literature there are few studies that conduct economic analysis for the treatment of textile wastewater with membrane processes 32 ciardelli et al 2001 investigated the treatment and reuse of textile wastewater 43 as a result of the economic feasibility studies it has been revealed that the 10 year cost of the facility would be 300 000 euros 75 000 euros would be spent annually for energy and chemical consumption in addition considering the results obtained in this study it was calculated that the membrane life time was maximum 3 years and therefore the 10 year total membrane cost including investment and replacement would be 120 000 euros considering the results of the study the total unit investment and operating costs would be 1 euro per m3 processed 43 besides cinperi et al 2019 used treated textile wastewater by a pilot mbr system in fabric dyeing tests 46 the characteristics of treated textile wastewater including conductivity turbidity tss cod and color were found similar to the characteristics of the softened process water it was reported that the reuse of treated wastewater at the pilot plant did not affect the quality of textile products negatively with the findings obtained in pilot scale studies cinperi et al 2019 conducted a cost analysis for full scale applications total investment and unit operating costs were found as approximately 2 000 000 usd and 1 usd per m3 processed respectively 46 wastewaters with high salt concentration or high pollutant load can be difficult to treat in some cases pretreatment or two main processes can be applied since it is difficult to treat wastewater with high salt concentration or high pollutant load tahri et al 2012 investigated the reuse of water in textile factories in the industrial zone by membrane processes 7 the examined textile factory produced 400 000 m3 wastewater annually that contained high color and inorganic salt concentration reuse of treated wastewater in dying process was found applicable with recoveries of 50 treated water and 30 salt 7 li et al 2020 investigated a pilot scale mbr nf hybrid system for treatment of textile wastewater 32 the investment cost of the pilot plant having a capacity of 2 4 m3 day was calculated as 22 264 usd and the operating cost was calculated as 13 465 usd per year in this case while 15 4 usd was spent per m3 wastewater 1 14 usd was saved if this treatment configuration was applied at full scale the investment cost for a 3000 m3 day capacity plant would be calculated as 3 871 000 usd and the annual operating cost would be 988 000 usd in this case while 0 902 usd will be spent per ton of wastewater 1 14 usd will be saved considering all the results of the study the proposed full scale system would be more economical than conventional treatment systems 32 in addition to polymeric membranes ceramic membrane applications have also been widely used recently according to some studies 58 61 ceramic membrane applications were not found financially feasible for textile wastewater treatment however agtas et al 2020 reported that the hot water could be recovered by applying ceramic membrane process in textile industry 24 based on feasibility analysis the investment cost of a pilot scale plant containing ceramic membrane was approximately 1 100 000 usd and the operating cost varied between 910 000 usd and 2 120 000 usd depending on the temperature of the water to be used in the system approximately 1 340 000 usd could be saved from both electricity and water reuse by using ceramic membrane 24 6 future perspectives reuse of treated wastewaters will become very important and necessary for the industries in near future especially for those consuming high water amounts such as textile industry in particular membrane processes have provided satisfactory results in water reuse compared to the other wastewater treatment processes however characterization of textile wastewaters beneficial use of the treated water and necessary treated water quality standards should be considered carefully in order to determine the optimum membrane process for treatment of textile wastewaters recently ceramic membrane applications have been getting attraction for the treatment of textile wastewaters according to the study conducted by agtas et al 2020 hot water reuse has been achieved by pilot scale ceramic membrane processes 24 it was reported that ceramic membrane process was financially feasible for recovery of hot water when the performance of this system is examined it is observed that full scale systems can be used in textile industries at different temperatures 24 in addition for the development and use of new separation or conversion processes it is necessary to a offer a more selective separation than can be achieved with conventional processes b not produce waste by products and c allow full integration of all process streams including recycling streams the three basic processes for integrated physicochemical wastewater treatment nanofiltration membrane distillation and membrane crystallization can be reconsidered in terms of their use in the integrated zero discharge almost approach 62 as it is known addition of nanomaterials to membranes has improved both physicochemical properties and processes in terms of permeability and selectivity silver carbon halloysite and titanium dioxide nanoparticles were used to modify the membranes applied for the treatment of textile wastewater it has been observed that with each addition of nanoparticles an increase in removal efficiency and the fluxes by considering the adsorption capacities of nanoparticles 23 according to study of shahmirzadi et al 2018 while the use of membranes containing nanocomposites in both lab and pilot scale studies is common the number of applications in full scale systems is quite low due to difficulties in the nanocomposite membrane production stages 22 to overcome this obstacle surface modifications development of new nanomaterials with special structures and optimization studies to increase the durability are required 22 in addition studies have recently been carried out on the application of dynamic membrane systems for the treatment of textile wastewater and water reuse in these studies it was observed that economic benefits would be achieved and dynamic membrane performance was quite high when removal efficiencies were examined however more work should be done to understand the mechanism of this treatment process and to improve its use in textile wastewater applications 29 7 conclusions textile industry includes a wide range of processes mainly including yarn production dyeing and printing and finishing treatment in the textile industry more energy and water is consumed in comparison to most of the other type of industries therefore reducing water and energy consumption is very important for textile industries in terms of both protecting the environment and natural water sources one of the most appropriate solutions to reach this aim is to treat textile wastewaters in appropriate processes and reuse it inside the industry membrane processes are one of the most advantageous processes for water reuse compared to other processes in the literature there are many studies focusing on the treatment of textile wastewater using lab scale membrane systems 95 of the studies have been researched as lab scale however there is still lack of enough research on the application of pilot and full scale systems for treatment of textile wastewaters it was observed that there are only 14 pilot scale studies and 8 full scale studies available studies on the pilot scale applications treating textile wastewaters showed that membrane processes were successful in efficient wastewater treatment enabling water reuse inside the industry a few full scale studies have been conducted on textile wastewater treatment and sufficient knowledge has not been available therefore pilot scale studies should provide both knowledge and experience in the transition of these systems to full scale based on the characteristics of the wastewater to be treated and the discharge standards the use of membrane processes especially hybrid systems has been deemed appropriate further research needs to be done on both system performance enhancement and water reuse options in addition cleaning methods should be developed for fouling control that is very important for membranes feasibility studies should be carried out in order to select the most efficient membrane process in terms of treatment performance and financial perspective declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13478,textile industries consume huge amount of water which is more than that is consumed by most of the other industries wastewater generated from textile industries contains high concentrations of pollutants thus the wastewater needs to be treated before discharging besides since large amount of wastewater is produced reuse of treated wastewater should be considered in environmental aspects since textile wastewater contains mainly dyestuffs it must be treated effectively using environmentally friendly technologies membrane processes are widely used in textile wastewater treatment as they have distinct advantages over conventional wastewater treatment methods most of the research done so far has been conducted in lab scale but gradually both pilot and full scale systems have been applied this review provides a comprehensive view of the treatment of textile wastewater and its reuse after proper treatment by membrane technologies at both pilot and full scale applications for this purpose physical and biological treatment methods were examined separately as a result of the examination it was observed that according to the characteristics of textile wastewater and discharge standards hybrid systems were generally used in the literature and very good results were obtained in terms of both filtration and treatment performance besides cleaning methods and economic feasibility for the membrane processes are also investigated in textile wastewater treatment furthermore due to the fact that full scale studies are less in comparison to pilot scale studies deficiencies in processes are mentioned in order to support future research studies keywords economic feasibility industrial wastewater treatment membrane process textile industry water reuse 1 introduction water is the most valuable and indispensable natural resource of the life 71 of the earth s surface is covered with water 97 5 of this amount is salt water and the rest is freshwater 1 requirement of water consumption in daily life is mainly supplied from fresh water resources 2 however with the increase in population in recent years there has been a serious increase in water demand for domestic consumption and agricultural and industrial applications 3 as a result of this increase protection of water resources has become very important to avoid water shortages in the future 4 several precautions can be taken to protect the water resources one of the most important precautions is the reuse of treated wastewater due to increasing demand for additional water resources 5 due to the insufficient water resources in industrial zones and or the low quality of existing water resources especially in these regions protection of water resources and water reuse facilities should be widely applied 6 one of the highest water consumer industries is the textile industry the amount of water used to process 1 ton of product in the textile industry is averagely between 230 and 270 tons 7 based on the world bank report approximately 20 of the wastewater generated from the industries is contributed from the textile industry 8 natural fibers such as cotton linen wool silk and fabricated fibers such as casein acetate cellulose ester nylon polyester acrylic and vinyl are produced in the textile industry in general yarn making weaving preparation and finishing of products are involved in this sector 9 since the yarn making and weaving preparation parts are dry processes the most of the water is consumed during finishing processes major finishing processes are sizing knitting desizing washing bleaching mercerization charring dyeing 10 wastewater generated from finishing processes contains non degradable organic materials toxic substances surfactants organic halogens and heavy metals 11 in addition this wastewater is generally rich in color chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolved solids tds and salinity 12 in particular the dyeing process accounts for more than 80 of the total produced wastewater 7 therefore the most important constituent of the textile wastewater is dye that contains soluble and insoluble fractions dyestuffs can be classified as basic acidic direct reactive azo disperse sulfur enhanced dyes and aniline black 13 the presence of dyes in water resources results in a threat for both environment and human health dyes in wastewater are harmful to human health due to their carcinogenic and mutagenic properties 4 besides they disrupt the balance in the ecosystem by reducing dissolved oxygen as a result of blocking the sunlight 1 due to high amount of water use in the production stages the textile industry needs to effectively treat its wastewater and should reuse the treated water in the production process 7 however since the removal of dyes from wastewater is not an easy process several treatment methods have been tested to date 14 the applied methods reported in the literature for treatment of textile wastewaters included physical chemical and biological processes 8 adsorption ion exchange and membrane processes have been applied as physical processes 15 17 while chemical coagulation electrocoagulation and oxidation have been applied as chemical processes 18 biological methods have been applied as aerobic and anaerobic processes 18 20 physical methods are relatively simple and low cost but they are known to have large amounts of concentrated sludge as the final product although chemical methods are effective in treatment generally they are costly and produce excessive sludge including toxic substances 21 however electrocoagulation is an intensively used hybrid system which is easy to apply and produces less sludge 22 biological processes are complex to manage are quickly affected by external factors and require large footprint 4 but these methods cannot sufficiently meet discharge standards as a result legal wastewater discharge limits are tightened every year and wastewater purification has become a huge issue for the textile industry 23 considering all of the treatment alternatives membrane technology is one of the most sustainable and widely applied technologies in textile wastewater treatment 12 24 25 also in recent years membrane technology can be a good option for treating textile dye wastewater because narrow pore sizes of membranes can eliminate dye compounds and discharge high quality effluent many studies have been performed for removing dyes with membranes technologies 23 membrane technology is one of the best methods in terms of novelty efficiency and purity for obtaining desired water quality for water reuse 23 membrane process is an advanced treatment technology which covers low space and is easy to apply enabling recovery of chemicals as well as water reuse 10 membranes that are used wastewater treatment are classified as microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro mf membranes have been used in dye and wash baths containing pigment dyes to remove colloidal dyes 12 26 it could also be used as pre treatment to prevent membrane fouling 22 uf membranes have been generally applied to recover high molecular weight substances auxiliary chemicals and direct indigo disperse and reactive dyes 27 28 in addition uf effluent could be reused in the rinsing and washing processes in the textile industry 29 nf membranes separate organic compounds divalent salts and hydrolyzed reactive dyes presented in wastewaters 30 whereas ro membranes can retain all mineral salts and hydrolyzed reactive dyes 31 membrane coupled biological processes e g membrane bioreactors mbrs produce less sludge adapt to more pollutant concentrations and occupy less space compared to other biological wastewater treatment methods 2 32 mbrs could remove both azo dyes and aromatic amines from textile wastewaters 33 membrane distillation md is an emerging thermal based membrane technology capable of treating a wide variety of feed water including high salinity brine and wastewater 34 although the use of membrane distillation technology in textile wastewater treatment has many advantages such as low electrical energy consumption complete elimination of non volatile solutes and ambient operating pressures it has been less studied in the literature compared to other processes 35 the high operating temperatures used in most textile dyeing mills mean that there is available waste heat that can be used to recycle water in one step through md the use of synthetic wastewater containing the predominant components of real wastewater namely dyes surfactants and salts was chosen to avoid any unknown variation from the actual samples 34 the main purposes of this review are i to investigate pilot and full scale studies conducted on the treatment of textile wastewater by membrane technology both physically and biologically ii examine cleaning methods which is important for fouling control iii investigate economic analysis of the membrane systems treating textile wastewater iv guide future studies with the available data in this review only pilot and full scale membrane applications for the treatment of textile wastewater were discussed including treatment and filtration performances in the application part both physical and biological studies are examined and summarized in detail the clogging and cleaning methods of the membranes used in the studies and their economic analysis were also examined in addition it was aimed to highlight needs for future research based on the current studies 2 historical development studies on the treatment of textile wastewater with membrane processes gained importance due to the advantages of these processes the major advantages are high quality of permeate production possibility to reuse of treated water within the textile production process small footprint and materials recovery since 1975 considering the analysis done by using scopus database 486 research papers and 23 review papers have been conducted on textile wastewater treatment since 1991 with the addition of membrane processes to the research topic then 117 research papers and 7 review papers have been conducted in addition the publications of the studies are increasing rapidly as can be seen in fig 1 effects of several parameters on the performance and morphology of membrane processes treating textile wastewaters have been studied at lab scale in the early studies 36 38 after adequate information has been gained at lab scale applications pilot and full scale systems have been investigated based on the literature studies it was determined that there were less studies performed at pilot and full scale in comparison to the lab scale applications fig 2 39 by examining pilot scale studies it can be understood whether full scale systems will work correctly and whether there will be performance losses engineering strategies should be implemented to ensure that full scale facilities can be applied at low cost and provide environment friendly treatment with high efficiency 40 membrane processes could be successfully enlarged when transitioning from lab scale to pilot and or full scale and it was also reported that membrane performance could be improved at larger scale applications 41 3 applications 3 1 pilot scale applications producing process water from wastewater by using membrane processes is a challenging task in the textile industry in order to achieve this wastewater characterization should be examined optimum technology and operating conditions should be determined and feasibility study should be carried out 31 pilot scale studies on both physical and biological membrane treatment systems in the literature were investigated in detail in the following sections treatment and filtration performances of pilot scale membrane processes used in the treatment of various types of textile wastewater are presented in table 1 3 1 1 physical treatment physical membrane treatment applications include mf uf nf and ro processes these processes can be applied both as the main treatment process and pre treatment process which is mainly applied in order to increase the efficiency of the whole treatment plant schematic illustration of physical treatment is presented in fig 3 pre treatment of textile wastewater generated from printing dyeing and rinsing units by uf process decreased cod concentration remarkably and protected the following nf process from fouling the reason for the fouling was due to dissolved inorganic and organic compounds 28 nf membrane provided more than 90 cod removal 90 color removal and 80 conductivity removal efficiencies in the study the flux of nf membrane was kept as 145 l m2 h at 15 bar 28 considering this study obtaining high quality permeate and reuse of the treated water in production processes of the textile industry were found appropriate 28 alcaina miranda et al 2009 investigated the treatment of textile wastewaters by uf and nf processes 42 spiral wound uf membrane module was used for pre treatment to remove large particles and thus avoid the fouling of nf membrane cod turbidity and color removal efficiencies were 64 76 95 99 and 75 by uf process respectively following uf two types of nf membranes including nf270 and nf 8040f were used for treatment of textile wastewaters generated from finishing unit the highest removal performance was achieved by nf270 membrane during this study membrane flux was maintained at 88 104 l m2 h and the transmembrane pressure tmp fluctuated between 8 and 10 bar 42 kurt et al 2012 investigated the treatment of textile wastewaters by nf and ro processes 31 the system had cartridge filters 5 μm and 1 μm string wound to remove suspended solids ss prior to nf and ro processes when nf and ro membrane performances were compared it was observed that ro process achieved better performance in terms of removal efficiency in both batch and continuous systems in the study it was reported that the fluxes of nf and ro membranes were 45 and 26 l m2 h at 6 and 20 bar respectively also when the membrane fouling experiments in the study were examined it was observed that irreversible fouling was 23 for nf membrane and 25 for ro membrane over the 5 days 31 barredo damas et al 2012 studied on the treatment of textile mill wastewaters by a ceramic membrane having an active layer of zirconium dioxide titanium dioxide zro2 tio2 and a support layer of tio2 cartridge filters 30 μm pleated and 5 μm string wound were used as pre treatment to remove big particles for avoiding membrane fouling which is reversible fouling for this process 29 different operational conditions were investigated by changing pressure between 1 and 4 5 bar and ph between 8 and 12 it was found that an increase in both ph and pressure resulted in an increase in cod ss and conductivity removal efficiencies a flux of 120 l m2 h was applied in the study at 2 bar considering this study ph and pressure were found to be important parameters that affect membrane performance for treatment of textile wastewaters 29 membrane applications can be used as a post treatment after a biological treatment process in which the pollutant load is high or the treatment is not sufficient bes pia et al 2009 applied activated sludge process and three different nf membranes to treat textile wastewater 27 since the activated sludge process did not provide required treated wastewater quality for reuse in the textile factory nf unit was added to the system as a post treatment process 27 in another study biological activated sludge process was used as a pre treatment method followed by membrane filtration processes uf ro for treatment of wastewaters from dyeing and finishing units in a textile factory in the study uf ro system was used as a hybrid system to reuse the treated textile wastewater in the textile factory conductivity cod and color removal efficiencies of 99 76 and 95 were obtained by the hybrid process respectively in the hybrid system flux of uf membrane was 25 l m2 h at 4 bar while flux of ro membrane was 9 3 l m2 h at 8 bar uf ro process was an effective hybrid system for the treatment of textile wastewater and reuse of treated water 43 tavangar et al 2019 applied electrocoagulation and nf processes for treatment of textile industry wastewater 8 since using electrocoagulation or membrane filtration alone was not sufficient to achieve required treatment performance nf was used following in electrocoagulation process turbidity cod and color removal efficiencies of 99 64 94 were achieved by the electrocoagulation process and removal efficiencies of 99 74 87 for the same parameters were achieved by the nf process respectively flux of nf membrane was kept as 50 l m2 h at 10 bar also it has been observed that membrane fouling of the nf membrane was irreversible in electrocoagulation process it has been observed that the membrane fouling depends on the type of electrode and if the al electrode is used the fouling was reversible 8 3 1 2 biological treatment onto membrane reactor performance of mbr systems treating textile wastewaters depends on many factors such as wastewater characteristics operational conditions membrane type and membrane configuration schematic illustration of biological treatment is presented in fig 4 yigit et al 2009 investigated the treatment of wastewaters from a denim producing textile industry containing 400 different dyes by an mbr process 44 experiments were carried out at mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration of 15 5 g l food to mass ratio f m ratio of 0 05 kg cod kg mlss day organic loading rate olr of 0 65 kg cod m3 day and hydraulic retention time hrt of 14 days considering the results of the study mbr process was found better in comparison to the conventional activated sludge system turbidity cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solid tss and color removal efficiencies of 99 8 97 4 96 7 97 6 and 97 8 were achieved by the mbr process the most important mechanisms of dye removal in mbr systems were biodegradation and sorption onto solids besides it was reported that permeate of the mbr process had potential to be reused in sizing dyeing and finishing units in the textile industries 44 luong et al 2016 investigated the treatment of textile wastewaters containing two different dyes and various salts by an mbr system 45 since the dyes and membrane surface were negatively charged charged exclusion mechanism was expected to occur the operating conditions of the mbr system in this study were applied as follows mlss concentration was 14 g l f m ratio was 0 2 kg cod kg mlss day olr was 1 4 kg cod m3 day and hrt was 65 h cod and color removal efficiencies of 95 and 80 were achieved by the mbr process in addition azo dyes presented in the wastewater had low biodegradability under aerobic conditions however mbr system applied without pre treatment provided high quality permeate which was appropriate for reuse in the industry 45 in some cases since only an mbr process does not provide the desired water quality enabling reuse hybrid mbr systems can be used to increase the removal efficiency of organics and color therefore several researchers have recently placed more emphasis on discovering the operational advantages of the hybrid processes based on the fact that each dye removal process has its own advantages and disadvantages a combination of different techniques can be used to achieve more efficient dye removal from wastewater cinperi et al 2019 investigated the treatment of textile wastewaters from woolen fabric production textile mill industry by different processes e g mbr mbr nf and mbr ro 46 basket type of fine screen was used as a pre treatment to remove solid substances conductivity turbidity cod and color removal were obtained as 11 4 99 70 and 62 by the mbr process 35 98 97 and 80 by the mbr nf process and 97 99 99 and 85 by the mbr ro process respectively following the results since only mbr process was not sufficient to achieve a high quality permeate nf or ro process should be used following the mbr process flux of nf membrane and ro membrane was applied as 10 l m2 h at 5 bar and 13 l m2 h at 12 bar respectively 46 3 2 full scale applications full scale studies in the literature are examined in this section treatment and filtration performances of the full scale membrane processes treating various textile wastewater types are presented in table 2 3 2 1 physical treatment generally uf and nf processes are mostly used for the treatment of textile wastewater pre treatment can also be applied in order to increase the treatment and filtration performance tahri et al 2012 investigated the treatment of dyeing wastewater which includes different dyes chemical substances and caustic soda by mf nf system 7 color turbidity ss conductivity and cod removal efficiencies were achieved as 97 2 99 5 100 42 4 and 75 5 respectively in the study the flux of mf membrane was 163 5 l m2 h at 2 bar and the flux of nf membrane was 45 l m2 h at 6 bar in addition when membrane fouling studies were examined it was observed that the fouling was irreversible and this was related to the interactions between nf and wastewater loads following the results of this study mf nf system was found effective for the treatment of textile wastewater in order to reuse it as process water 7 fersi et al 2008 investigated the application of uf nf processes for treatment of biologically treated textile wastewaters 48 uf tubular porous ceramic membrane module was used as a pre treatment step prior to nf membrane to remove big particles nf process was applied with and without uf pre treatment to evaluate the treatment performance uf nf combination provided better results in terms of removal efficiency in comparison to application of only nf process flux of nf membrane was 85 l m2 h at 11 bar 48 moreover sahinkaya et al 2019 investigated the treatment of wastewaters generated from an industrial area where 65 textile companies are located by using uf process as pre treatment followed by ro membrane systems 49 the reason of using uf was to remove the solids and to decrease the load fed to the ro process three recirculation methods including recirculation of only concentrate recirculation of both permeate and concentrate and 70 permeate recirculation were tested however no visible difference was observed among them conductivity color and cod removal efficiencies were found as 98 93 and 76 respectively for each mode flux of ro membrane was kept as 19 l m2 h at 8 bar 49 uf and electrodialysis processes were used for the treatment of cotton fabric primary treated textile wastewater by lafi et al 2018 uf process was used to remove macromolecules colloids and color electrodialysis was used to separate the ionic species two types of operation mode with only uf process and uf ed combination was investigated in this study according to the results of this study uf ed system was found more effective compared to uf process for treatment of the textile wastewater with uf ed system conductivity turbidity and cod removal efficiencies were found as 97 100 and 77 respectively in the study flux of uf membrane was applied as 150 l m2 h at 5 bar in addition the cause of membrane fouling was explained as adsorption of organic pollutants on the membrane surface and into the pores 12 moreover nandy et al 2007 investigated the treatment of wastewater from a textile processing industry including fabric dyeing and printing 50 two different pre treatment processes including chlorination multi grade filter and dechlorination antiscalant dosing prior to uf and ro processes respectively have been tested color and ss were completely removed by this system 50 in another study coagulation and flocculation processes were applied as for pre treatment purpose prior to nf process treating woolen textile wastewater with an increase in both pressure from 4 to 8 bar and ph from 6 to 10 a decrease in the turbidity removal efficiency from 72 9 to 67 4 and an increase in the cod removal efficiency from 91 5 to 96 1 were observed flux of nf membrane was applied as 54 l m2 h at 9 bar they mentioned that pre treatment with coagulation and flocculation processes which was followed by the nf process could be a promising alternative for the reuse of treated textile wastewaters 11 3 2 2 biological treatment onto membrane bioreactor biological treatment can be applied for the treatment of textile wastewaters which results in an efficient removal of cod total nitrogen ammonium nitrate and nitrite especially mbr treatment is an efficient method for treating textile wastewaters with a focus on color removal 44 de jager et al 2014 studied the treatment of textile wastewater using uf dual stage mbr ro system 30 cod turbidity color and conductivity removal efficiencies were obtained as 75 94 28 6 and 28 6 respectively by the mbr process although the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant was sufficient for discharge standards by using sole mbr system ro treatment was applied to remove residual color and conductivity removal efficiencies of cod turbidity color and conductivity were 87 97 95 and 93 respectively by the mbr ro system 30 moreover li et al 2020 studied the treatment of textile wastewater by mbr nf process after anaerobic treatment the mbr incorporated a membrane module containing forty pieces of flat sheet uf membrane with an effective volume of 1 5 m3 32 experiments were carried out at mlss concentration of 8 93 g l f m ratio of 0 87 kg cod kg mlss day olr of 34 76 g cod m3 day and hrt of 12 h mbr process provided cod turbidity and color removal efficiencies of 75 4 99 and 59 2 respectively when nf process was used after the mbr process removal efficiencies of cod turbidity and color increased up to 97 3 99 6 and 96 5 respectively enabling suitable permeate quality for reuse in the process 32 overall it can be stated that mbr process is much more effective in comparison to other systems such as conventional activated sludge process and permeate obtained by an mbr process has high potential for reuse inside the textile industry 44 4 cleaning methods for membrane applications in textile wastewater treatment fouling is commonly defined as the accumulation of unwanted material on solid surfaces with an associated detriment of function the types of fouling that can occur in membrane systems can be divided into four categories inorganic salt scaling or precipitation fouling particulate fouling biological fouling and chemical membrane degradation 51 membrane fouling is one of the most important problems of membrane processes as it reduces permeate flux and thus affects its selectivity 25 fouling may be caused by dissolved inorganic or organic compounds colloids bacteria and or ss 7 28 however different cleaning methods can be applied since the fouling type may differ according to the membrane processes operational conditions sludge properties and configurations 52 53 generally when flux decreases or transmembrane pressure increases the membrane should be cleaned or replaced 52 membrane cleaning is routinely performed to ensure stable operation over time the frequency with which cleaning operations are performed depends on a variety of factors including the type of separation process involved feedwater quality process conditions membrane design and others 34 membrane cleaning processes are classified as physical and chemical methods cleaning of the cake layer accumulated on the membrane surface by using hydraulic mechanical or electrical force application is called physical cleaning process 54 these can include air backwashing aeration vibration ultrasound and water flushing although compared to chemical techniques these have been less widely explored in the literature backwashing is a commonly used cleaning method for pressure driven membrane processes and is widely used in membrane bioreactors mbrs aeration employs the shear forces imparted by air bubbles onto the membrane surface to reduce fouling layer 34 in order to remove foulants from the membrane surface turbulence is increased in hydraulic and mechanical cleaning besides voltage can be applied to the membrane surface in electrical cleaning method 54 physical cleaning processes commonly remove reversible fouling such as cake layer and deposited solids reversible fouling reduces productivity and increases operational cost also physical cleaning is not as effective as chemical cleaning and does not require any chemical reagents 7 53 the ideal chemical cleaning method is to remove all dirt and limestone from the membrane surface recovering 100 of the initial distillation flow and preventing pore wetting without affecting the mechanical stability of the membrane in practice chemical cleaning regains only a fraction of the original performance of the membrane and may be required every few months or more at the expense of the membrane s life 34 chemical cleaning is generally applied in situ especially with alkaline and acidic solutions by using chemical cleaning method especially the formation of a gel layer on the membrane surface and the irreversible fouling caused the pore clogging could be eliminated 53 acid cleaning especially cleaning with hcl is one of the most common methods used for dirty membrane remediation in md systems acid cleaning is performed as a batch process by replacing the feed water with an acidic solution it is known that the effectiveness of acid washing varies considerably depending on the type of contamination it has been found that alkaline solutions that are more soluble at lower ph are removed very effectively by acid scrubbing including the most common lime caco3 51 in addition ultrasonic cleaning is one of the unconventional methods by using frequency sound waves to remove adherents on the membrane 54 high frequency vibrations cause cavitation the formation of small vapour filled bubbles in the surrounding liquid when these cavities collapse or implode they generate shockwaves which produce a physical force capable of dislodging weakly attached particles from surfaces 34 the main advantage of this method is that the cleaning method can be applied while the filtration continues without stopping the system 54 generally the reason for fouling of membranes used in textile wastewater is fouling layer on the membrane surface 55 a common problem of membrane fouling caused by textile wastewater being colored water is the thin gel like dye layer on the upper surface of the membrane however the fouling layer can be easily washed off by physically flushing fresh water without using any chemicals 56 for example li et al 2020 conducted studies to make membranes used in textile wastewater treatment electro cleanable as a result of this study they observed that after 5 min of electrical cleaning most of the contaminants on the membrane surface were degraded by electro catalysis and the membrane surface was cleaned after electro cleaning it was found that the permeable flux recovery rate was more than 90 57 ong et al 2014 examined that fouling and chemical membrane cleaning procedures in textile wastewater treatment 21 membrane flux was measured at different time intervals and when the flux dropped to 80 of the initial flux it was considered that the membrane was contaminated and chemical washing was required the membrane was cleaned first with an alkaline solution then with an acidic solution and washed with distilled water this process took 30 min and membrane contamination was eliminated 21 according to the studies of de lara et al 2012 and lafi et al 2018 membrane filtration performance was improved after a chemical washing process 12 25 in the first stage the membrane surface was cleaned with distilled water for 15 min then an alkaline cleaning process was carried out for 1 h after this process the membrane surface was washed again with distilled water then the fluxes were examined and it was observed that cleaning process was not enough to enhance membrane filtration performance so cleaning with acidic solution was applied for 1 more hour followed by rinsing with distilled water no pressure was applied during these processes the water flux was checked to ensure membrane filtration performance and a flux recovery of 90 was observed 12 25 moreover in the study of li et al 2020 the cleaning methods of both mbr and nf membranes after treatment of textile wastewater were investigated 32 when tmp of the mbr system exceeded 20 kpa chemical washing was performed with sodium hypochlorite and citric acid followed by an aeration for 6 h without any wastewater coming into the system in addition alkaline and acidic cleaning was performed for the nf membrane and the surface was washed with distilled water then the nf membrane was soaked in deionized water for 24 h and prepressed under 12 bar for at least 2 h to ensure a steady structure before each experiment to eliminate contamination as a result of chemical cleaning performances of both mbr and nf processes were improved 32 5 economic feasibility of membrane processes for textile wastewater treatment besides the performance of the membrane applications for treatment of textile wastewaters their economic feasibility is also very important especially for the pilot and full scale plants in the literature there are few studies that conduct economic analysis for the treatment of textile wastewater with membrane processes 32 ciardelli et al 2001 investigated the treatment and reuse of textile wastewater 43 as a result of the economic feasibility studies it has been revealed that the 10 year cost of the facility would be 300 000 euros 75 000 euros would be spent annually for energy and chemical consumption in addition considering the results obtained in this study it was calculated that the membrane life time was maximum 3 years and therefore the 10 year total membrane cost including investment and replacement would be 120 000 euros considering the results of the study the total unit investment and operating costs would be 1 euro per m3 processed 43 besides cinperi et al 2019 used treated textile wastewater by a pilot mbr system in fabric dyeing tests 46 the characteristics of treated textile wastewater including conductivity turbidity tss cod and color were found similar to the characteristics of the softened process water it was reported that the reuse of treated wastewater at the pilot plant did not affect the quality of textile products negatively with the findings obtained in pilot scale studies cinperi et al 2019 conducted a cost analysis for full scale applications total investment and unit operating costs were found as approximately 2 000 000 usd and 1 usd per m3 processed respectively 46 wastewaters with high salt concentration or high pollutant load can be difficult to treat in some cases pretreatment or two main processes can be applied since it is difficult to treat wastewater with high salt concentration or high pollutant load tahri et al 2012 investigated the reuse of water in textile factories in the industrial zone by membrane processes 7 the examined textile factory produced 400 000 m3 wastewater annually that contained high color and inorganic salt concentration reuse of treated wastewater in dying process was found applicable with recoveries of 50 treated water and 30 salt 7 li et al 2020 investigated a pilot scale mbr nf hybrid system for treatment of textile wastewater 32 the investment cost of the pilot plant having a capacity of 2 4 m3 day was calculated as 22 264 usd and the operating cost was calculated as 13 465 usd per year in this case while 15 4 usd was spent per m3 wastewater 1 14 usd was saved if this treatment configuration was applied at full scale the investment cost for a 3000 m3 day capacity plant would be calculated as 3 871 000 usd and the annual operating cost would be 988 000 usd in this case while 0 902 usd will be spent per ton of wastewater 1 14 usd will be saved considering all the results of the study the proposed full scale system would be more economical than conventional treatment systems 32 in addition to polymeric membranes ceramic membrane applications have also been widely used recently according to some studies 58 61 ceramic membrane applications were not found financially feasible for textile wastewater treatment however agtas et al 2020 reported that the hot water could be recovered by applying ceramic membrane process in textile industry 24 based on feasibility analysis the investment cost of a pilot scale plant containing ceramic membrane was approximately 1 100 000 usd and the operating cost varied between 910 000 usd and 2 120 000 usd depending on the temperature of the water to be used in the system approximately 1 340 000 usd could be saved from both electricity and water reuse by using ceramic membrane 24 6 future perspectives reuse of treated wastewaters will become very important and necessary for the industries in near future especially for those consuming high water amounts such as textile industry in particular membrane processes have provided satisfactory results in water reuse compared to the other wastewater treatment processes however characterization of textile wastewaters beneficial use of the treated water and necessary treated water quality standards should be considered carefully in order to determine the optimum membrane process for treatment of textile wastewaters recently ceramic membrane applications have been getting attraction for the treatment of textile wastewaters according to the study conducted by agtas et al 2020 hot water reuse has been achieved by pilot scale ceramic membrane processes 24 it was reported that ceramic membrane process was financially feasible for recovery of hot water when the performance of this system is examined it is observed that full scale systems can be used in textile industries at different temperatures 24 in addition for the development and use of new separation or conversion processes it is necessary to a offer a more selective separation than can be achieved with conventional processes b not produce waste by products and c allow full integration of all process streams including recycling streams the three basic processes for integrated physicochemical wastewater treatment nanofiltration membrane distillation and membrane crystallization can be reconsidered in terms of their use in the integrated zero discharge almost approach 62 as it is known addition of nanomaterials to membranes has improved both physicochemical properties and processes in terms of permeability and selectivity silver carbon halloysite and titanium dioxide nanoparticles were used to modify the membranes applied for the treatment of textile wastewater it has been observed that with each addition of nanoparticles an increase in removal efficiency and the fluxes by considering the adsorption capacities of nanoparticles 23 according to study of shahmirzadi et al 2018 while the use of membranes containing nanocomposites in both lab and pilot scale studies is common the number of applications in full scale systems is quite low due to difficulties in the nanocomposite membrane production stages 22 to overcome this obstacle surface modifications development of new nanomaterials with special structures and optimization studies to increase the durability are required 22 in addition studies have recently been carried out on the application of dynamic membrane systems for the treatment of textile wastewater and water reuse in these studies it was observed that economic benefits would be achieved and dynamic membrane performance was quite high when removal efficiencies were examined however more work should be done to understand the mechanism of this treatment process and to improve its use in textile wastewater applications 29 7 conclusions textile industry includes a wide range of processes mainly including yarn production dyeing and printing and finishing treatment in the textile industry more energy and water is consumed in comparison to most of the other type of industries therefore reducing water and energy consumption is very important for textile industries in terms of both protecting the environment and natural water sources one of the most appropriate solutions to reach this aim is to treat textile wastewaters in appropriate processes and reuse it inside the industry membrane processes are one of the most advantageous processes for water reuse compared to other processes in the literature there are many studies focusing on the treatment of textile wastewater using lab scale membrane systems 95 of the studies have been researched as lab scale however there is still lack of enough research on the application of pilot and full scale systems for treatment of textile wastewaters it was observed that there are only 14 pilot scale studies and 8 full scale studies available studies on the pilot scale applications treating textile wastewaters showed that membrane processes were successful in efficient wastewater treatment enabling water reuse inside the industry a few full scale studies have been conducted on textile wastewater treatment and sufficient knowledge has not been available therefore pilot scale studies should provide both knowledge and experience in the transition of these systems to full scale based on the characteristics of the wastewater to be treated and the discharge standards the use of membrane processes especially hybrid systems has been deemed appropriate further research needs to be done on both system performance enhancement and water reuse options in addition cleaning methods should be developed for fouling control that is very important for membranes feasibility studies should be carried out in order to select the most efficient membrane process in terms of treatment performance and financial perspective declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13479,pbo2 based electrodes possess the greatest oxygen evolution overpotential range beside boron doped diamond bdd which allowed aqueous solution electrochemical oxidization of hazardous organic contaminants as a non active electrode pbo2 based electrode can generate rich free hydroxyl radicals favorable for the degradation of target pollutants the majority of published review articles to date focuses on the application of bdd electrodes metal oxide mo electrodes or mixed metal oxide mmo for treatment of wastewater however there is an increasingly need for reasonable catalyst design of pbo2 based electrodes because suitable electrode materials fundamentally determine the electrocatalytic performance hence in this review recent advances in properties preparation and degradation mechanism of pbo2 based electrodes are summarized with a focus on various modifying strategies eventually research gaps and future perspectives of pbo2 based electrodes are discussed graphical abstract this review highlights recent advances on engineering approach towards design of pbo2 based electrodes for the anodic oxidation of organic pollutants unlabelled image keywords electrochemical oxidization pbo2 based electrodes modifying strategies organic pollutants 1 introduction nowadays energy crisis and environmental pollution are two major issues facing countries all over the world in particular organic pollutants in wastewater released from various factories including cosmetic paper fabricating printing food and pharmaceutical industries are characteristic of diversity in types and refractoriness 1 8 moreover agriculture plays a pivotal role in the world economy and the ever increased usage of pesticides threatens the safety of our daily drinking water 9 11 to resolve this tough problem a great deal of wastewater treatment technologies such as photocatalysis 12 15 biological degradation 16 18 physical adsorption 19 22 ozone oxidation 23 25 and electrochemical methods 26 30 have been commonly employed among them electrochemical oxidization eo of organic pollutants is recognized as an advanced wastewater treatment method which can achieve complete mineralization of targeted organic pollutants 31 32 eo possesses several prestigious advantages over other conventional treatment methods including ease of operation high degradation efficiency low cost and no secondary waste generation for example the electric power supply acts as the major driving force for the degradation of organic pollutants by eo and it is applicable for treatment of turbid and colored wastewater which is difficult to treat by photocatalysis in addition a significant smaller working area of eo is needed in comparison with that of biological treatment methods 33 besides eo has the advantage of easy control through automation and the absence of additional chemicals necessary to conduct the process such as in the fenton process this is due to the high electric conductivity of industrial wastewaters which usually exceeds 10 ms cm more significantly it is easy to achieve degradation of highly toxic pollutants without secondary waste generation such as consumed adsorbents contaminated residues and ferric hydroxide sludge that occurs during physical adsorption nanofiltration biological methods and fenton reactions however analogous to other previously reported treatment methods eo possesses some shortcomings which are passivation polarization and corrosion of electrodes respectively polarization of electrodes usually occurs when the mass transfer is poor and generated gases accumulate on the electrode surface 34 this will result in the depletion of active species located in the boundary layer of electrodes passivation of electrodes is caused by the inert intermediates that are formed during the oxidization reactions nonetheless polarization and passivation of electrodes can be suppressed by agitation such as using a magnetic stirrer centrifugal pumps or turbulence promoters another issue is the corrosion of electrodes due to the oxidization reactions of the active anode materials and the generation of corrosive products such as chlorine gas and thiosulfate ions to resolve this matter it is of significant necessity to choose appropriate electrode materials or developing novel functional electrode materials to date a variety of eo electrode materials including noble metals like pt or mn 35 36 carbon and graphite 37 38 metal oxide mo and mixed metal oxide mmo 39 42 boron doped diamond bdd 43 47 and other mixed types of electrodes 48 50 have been employed for the wastewater treatment in general they can be classified into two categories namely active electrodes pt iro2 ruo2 and non active electrodes sno2 pbo2 bdd among them the most common electrodes are bdd pbo2 and sno2 because of their high oxygen evolution revolution oer overpotential and superior electrocatalytic performance during the oxidization process of organic pollutants bdd is reported to possess the greatest electrical potential before water decomposition which minimizes the evolution of oxygen or hydrogen and simultaneously allows for the almost complete oxidization of organic pollutants 51 however the preparation process of bdd is far more complicated and expensive which limits its practical application in wastewater purification areas sno2 is also a highly efficient anode material but it is usually prepared by thermal deposition method leading to multi crack surface which brings the poor corrosion resistance ability and short service lifespan 52 by contrast pbo2 has been viewed as the optimal anode material considering its facile preparation inexpensive cost superior corrosion resistance and high hydroxyl radicals oh generation capability as a non active anode direct oxidization of organic pollutants on the surface of pbo2 anode is allowed nevertheless the electrocatalytic efficiency of pure pbo2 anode towards most organic pollutants is poorer than that of bdd and sno2 and requires further promotion consequently pbo2 anode in most cases is used in its doped form for wastewater treatment as adding suitable dopants such as metal elements non metal elements and metal oxide can effectively improve the electrocatalytic activity of pbo2 anode 53 55 a considerable amount of published works over the past two decades suggest the appropriateness of pbo2 based anode for oxidization of refractory organic pollutants previous reviews mainly concentrate on the subject of bdd anodes metal oxide anodes and mmo electrodes with a discussion on the properties preparation methods effects of operating conditions on the electrocatalytic activity and various applications during the electrocatalytic degradation process 51 56 58 however a focused review on the catalyst design of pbo2 based anodes for oxidization of persistent organic pollutants still remains unavailable in the literature as a result in this review we first briefly summarize the already reported synthesis approaches and electrochemical properties of pbo2 based anodes then recent representative articles in regard to the design strategies of pbo2 based anodes are reviewed and discussed in detail table 1 eventually we will offer several future perspectives and stress on the significance of pbo2 based anodes employed for the electrochemical degradation of organic compounds 2 synthesis and properties of pbo2 based electrodes pbo2 based electrodes have been subjected to wide investigation for the remediation of wastewater containing refractory and toxic pollutants due to their superior electrochemical properties suitable for this application generally pbo2 exists in two forms namely orthorhombic α pbo2 with brown color and β pbo2 with black color in comparison with α pbo2 β pbo2 with a disordered close packed structure possesses a relatively higher conductivity and higher overpotential towards oxygen evolution reactions thus more favorable for the anodic oxidization of organic pollutants furthermore β pbo2 belongs to a non active anode characteristic of chemical inertness low cost high conductivity and high oer overpotential as a consequence the majority of reported work related to pbo2 based electrodes for degradation of organic pollutants chooses β pbo2 as the anode the onset oer potential of pbo2 electrodes is reported to range between 1 8 v and 2 0 v versus a standard hydrogen electrode she an electrochemical reference for half cell potential reactions which is second only to bdd electrodes 58 this broad potential range accounts for the high current efficiency for degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater as the generation of oxygen or hydrogen is minimized due to the superior electrochemical merits direct oxidization of toxic organic compounds on the surface of pbo2 based electrodes is allowed nonetheless the majority of pbo2 based electrodes achieve degradation of organics through the generation of hydroxyl radicals it is found that in comparison with other anodes like platinum pt titanium ti and graphite pbo2 based electrodes tend to exhibit greater degree of organic pollutant mineralization this is mainly ascribed to another unique characteristic of pbo2 based electrodes which is that the obtained hydroxyl radicals are weakly absorbed on the anode surface thus allowing more free hydroxyl radicals dispersed in the solution as a result unlike many other anode materials with high oer overpotential it is the free hydroxyl radicals that account primarily for the mineralization of noxious organic compounds which interact more effectively with the compounds than the strong absorbed hydroxyl radicals on the anode surface 59 similarly to bdd electrodes pbo2 based electrodes are also renowned for their excellent corrosion resistance and durability during the degradation process under the chemically mechanically and thermally harsh conditions with a highly hydrophobic surface and specific structure pbo2 based electrodes possess an inert and low adsorption characteristic which is resistant to electrode deactivation however in extremely challenging operation conditions pbo2 based electrodes suffer from the risk of lead leaking into the solution even so by utilizing suitable preparation methods the corrosion resistance can be conditioned and the leaching of lead ions in acidic environment can be avoided by applying appropriate current density thermal decomposition electrodeposition both in acidic and alkali media and electrooxidization anodization are the techniques commonly employed for the fabrication of pbo2 electrodes 60 62 among them the electrodeposition method used for fabrication of pbo2 electrodes is the most common one owing to its ease of operation easy control and rapid preparation in this method current density concentration of the electrolyte usually naf and spacing of the electrode are all influencing factors for the quality of the as prepared pbo2 electrodes recently several new preparation methods of pbo2 electrodes have been reported 63 67 for example duan et al prepared a novel pbo2 anode hl ht pbo2 by hydrolysis coupled with a hydrothermal process 66 this novel anode exhibited higher degradation efficiency towards sodium pentachlorophenate pcp na than traditional electrodeposited pbo2 anodes and under the same operating conditions the mineralization current efficiency of hl ht pbo2 was 2 7 times as that of the electrodeposited pbo2 anode ed pbo2 zhang and his coauthors 67 reported a magnetically assembled method for the fabrication of pbo2 anode and the anode called mae showed superior variability and versatility more significantly it allowed more efficient flexible and versatile electrochemical oxidation treatment of organic wastewater in this review the discussion focuses on the electrodeposition method as it is more frequently employed for preparation of pbo2 based electrodes 3 modifying strategies for improving the activity of pbo2 based electrodes to improve the electrocatalytic performance of pbo2 based electrodes towards refractory organics some modifying strategies are required generally a complete pbo2 based electrode consists of three major components substrate interlayer and active layer the substrate of pbo2 based electrodes has been mostly reported to be titanium ti plate or stainless steel plate considering their high conductivity and low cost in particular in addition beer et al 68 recognized titanium as a self healing substrate as it can anodically generate an inert tio2 layer protecting itself against corrosion the role of interlayer is to connect the active layer and the substrate which can not only suppress the passivation of substrate but can also enhance the chemical stability corrosion resistance and service lifetime of the anode the active layer plays an essential role in the effective degradation of targeted contaminants as it offers the reaction sites for the organics and the generated products during the degradation process therefore the research of this section is to summarize recent advances in the design strategies of pbo2 based electrodes for electrooxidization of organics in wastewater mainly from two categories choosing suitable interlayer materials and adding efficient dopants 3 1 interlayer the interlayer favors for the active layer to adhere strongly onto the substrate so as to promote the stability and simultaneously enhance the conductivity the commonly employed interlayer materials for pbo2 based electrodes are sno2 sb2o3 and α pbo2 although these two materials have been confirmed to greatly improve the corrosion resistance of the anode their impact on the improvement of electrocatalytic performance is still limited thus much effort has been devoted to seeking the suitable interlayer materials for boosting the activity of pbo2 based electrodes and great achievements have been achieved for example duan et al 69 reported a three dimensional anode 3dg pbo2 with the graphene as the interlayer which was prepared by a co electrodeposition technique for the electrocatalytic degradation of perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos it was discovered that the optimal anode called 3dg pbo2 0 08 the concentration of 3dg in the electrolyte is 0 08 g l possessed the best electrocatalytic performance which was attributed to the strong hydroxyl radicals generation ability more active sites due to the enlarged surface area and rapid charge transfer as clearly shown in fig 1 a and b the 3dg pbo2 0 08 electrode with a highly interconnected 3d network structure was uniform and compact in comparison with pyramid shaped pure pbo2 electrode moreover under the operating conditions of the initial pfos concentration of 50 mg l current density of 30 ma cm 2 ph 7 and 30 c the removal ratio of the 3dg pbo2 0 08 electrode towards pfos reached 96 17 far higher than 75 13 of pure pbo2 electrode more recently zno film has been reported to be an ideal interlayer material for pbo2 based electrodes as it can not only alleviate the electrical distortion between the substrate and the active layer but also improve the cracking of the active layer gui and his coauthors 70 utilized a polystyrene ps microsphere template strategy to prepare a stainless steel based ordered porous zno film subsequently a vertically oriented nanosphere pbo2 array electrode was fabricated on the as prepared grid like zno film by anodic oxidization method and applied for the electrocatalytic oxidization of phenol as can be observed from fig 1 c and d the morphology of the array pbo2 electrode and the traditional pbo2 electrode showed remarkable difference the new electrode possessed a regular petal like array structure while the traditional pbo2 electrode held a typical pyramid structure under the operating conditions of 0 1 mol l 1 na2so4 100 mg l phenol a current density of 30 ma cm 2 and 25 c the removal efficiency of the array pbo2 electrode towards phenol reached 100 after 180 min far outweighed that of the traditional pbo2 electrode 75 as displayed in fig 1 e and f the significantly improved electrocatalytic degradation activity is substantiated by the dramatically increased electrochemical active surface area another similar work was reported by gui et al 71 where a zno peg polyethylene glycol co ii pbo2 composite electrode was prepared with zno film as the intermediate layer using the anodic electrodeposition technique the obtained electrode exhibited excellent degradation efficiency removal ratio 91 1 towards phenol with a higher current efficiency lower activation energy and smaller charge transfer resistance therefore suitable interlayer materials are capable of improving the electrocatalytic oxidization of refractory organics and for convenience several high quality works related to it are also available here 72 74 3 2 doping 3 2 1 metal element doping pure pbo2 electrode has been widely employed for electrooxidization of persistent pollutants for wastewater treatment and also in its doped form adding suitable dopants can generate unexpected effects on the electrochemical properties of pbo2 based electrodes metal elements such as ni co fe bi and cu are the commonly employed dopants 59 75 77 xia et al 77 reported a novel nickel doped pbo2 electrode prepared via electrodeposition in nitrate solution and the optimal doping amount of nickel was discovered to be 1 with a more compact pbo2 film and the diminished size of crystal grains this new electrode possessed the highest kinetic rate constant chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc removals which were 1 41 1 22 and 1 20 times than those of pure pbo2 electrode respectively thus showing superior electrocatalytic oxidization of aspirin similar effect was observed for co doped pbo2 studied by wang et al 75 which showed outstanding hydrophilicity and electrical conductivity owing to the improvement of its microcrystal structure in another work the addition of cu into pbo2 electrode remarkably enhanced the electrocatalytic performance 76 the as prepared cu doped pbo2 electrode were used for the electrooxidization degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater that contains amoxicillin shown in fig 2 a was the combustion efficiency of electrochemical oxidation of amoxicillin at two different electrodes under the optimal operating conditions the combustion efficiency of cu pbo2 electrode was 98 4 while that of non doped pbo2 electrode was 65 6 as a result the enhanced combustion efficiency togerther with the increased hydroxyl radicals accounted for the more efficient amoxicillin degradation in addition rare earth metals like yb er nd and ce have also been regarded as prominent dopants for modifying the electrochemical properties of pbo2 electrode due to their unique characteristics 53 78 80 apart from single atom doping two or more metal elements co doping can also significantly promote the electrocatalytic performance of pbo2 electrode 81 85 for instance pan et al 81 successfully fabricated cerium ce and neodymium nd co doped lead dioxide pbo2 electrode via conventional electrodeposition technique and it was further applied for methyl orange mo degradation the obtained co doped electrode possessed smaller crystal sizes more compact structure and higher electrocatalytic activity than those of the single doped and undoped pbo2 electrodes as illustrated in fig 2 among the four types of electrodes the as prepared ce nd pbo2 electrode showed the highest oxygen evolution potential oep lowest charge transfer resistance longest service lifetime and highest mo removal rate additionally it exihibited the lower energy consumption than the other three kinds of electrodes similarly dai and his group reported a novel la y pbo2 electrode prepared by electrodeposition method which was employed for electrocatalytic degradation of aspirin 82 in comparison with non doped and single element doped electrodes the la y pbo2 electrode displayed a more compact surface with a smaller microcrystal grain size simultaneouly generating more active oxygen species besides the larger the electrochemical active surface area the higher apparent rate constant mass transport and current efficiency leaded to the superior degradation performance towards aspirin consequently co doping strategy has been validated to effectively promote the electrocatalytic performance of pbo2 based electrodes 3 2 2 non metal doping non metal dopants like phosphorus p fluorine f graphite and nano diamond possess specific merits and incorporating them into the targeted catalysts can effectively modify their nanostructure and electrochemical properties furthermore several published papers have proved the effectiveness of introducing non metal elements as dopants into pbo2 electrodes 54 74 86 87 dargahi et al 54 used an anodic oxidization approach to successfully prepare graphite doped pbo2 anode for electrochemical degradation of methylene blue mb and practical textile wastewater under the optimal experimental conditions the removal ratio of mb reached 96 4 and the kinetic coefficient of electrochemical mb removal by the graphite doped pbo2 anode was about 2 62 times higher than that of pure graphite anode which corresponded to the pseudo first order kinetic model as reported by li and his coauthors 87 a novel phosphorus doped pbo2 electrode was prepared by a simple and inexpensive electrochemical method for the first time this new electrode showed better electrocatalytic performance than the non doped pbo2 electrode in another work a nano diamond doped pbo2 anode with reduced ti nanotube as the interlayer was successfully prepared and it was utilized for electrochemical degradation of bentazon 74 distinctive from other dopants nano diamond can act as the active sites itself and simultaneously facilitate the electrodeposition of pbo2 by the formation of negatively charged pb2 nano diamond complex the average current efficiency of this anode reached 30 1 5 times higher than that of non doped pbo2 anode which is ascribed to the higher oxygen evolution overpotential larger active area and samller charge transfer resistance however the majority of pbo2 based electrodes are fabricated via anodic oidization method thus limited to several non metal element doping and published papers related to it are far less than that of metal element doping nevertheless one can introduce the non metal elements into pbo2 powder through other methods like hydrothermal method before coating it into the substrate of the electrode as a result much more effort is expected to be devoted to non metal element doping into pbo2 electrode for improving their pollutant degradation efficiency 3 2 3 metal oxide doping in the last two decades mixed metal oxide mmo electrodes have contributed substantially in electrocatalysis showing distinctive advantages over other electrodes i e high electrochemical stability inexpensive cost and long service lifetime a great deal of reasearch work has reported the effectiveness of metal oxide as the dopant for improving the electrocatalytic performance of pbo2 electrodes 88 91 yao et al 91 prepared pbo2 ceo2 nanocomposite electrodes by traditional electrodeposition method in the lead nitrate solution containing ceo2 nanoparticles in comparison with non doped and ce doped pbo2 electrode this composite electrode possessed higher oer overpotential and longer service lifetime 135 h with the malachite green mg and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency up to 95 4 and 69 3 respectively moreover teng and his coauthors 92 studied the corrosion resistance performance of pbo2 zro2 electrode with sodium chloride as the electrolyte it was found that pbo2 zro2 electrode with a more compact and smooth surface possessed stronger corrosion resistance and longer lifespan 146 h more recently zhang et al 93 have fabricated a new ti pbo2 sm2o3 composite electrode by a facile electrodeposition method leading to a high electrocatalytic activity towards treatment of wastewater containing alizarin yellow r ayr this composite electrode stacked by typical pyramid like microparticles exhibits smooth and compact surface morphology which is conducive to promoting the corrosion resistance fig 3 besides the accelerated lifetime of the ti pbo2 sm2o3 composite electrode 22 h is 1 7 times more than that of the ti pbo2 electrode 13 h and the cod and ayr removal efficiency of ti pbo2 sm2o3 composite electrode reached 79 90 and 80 00 respectively far greater than those of ti pbo2 electrode 39 00 and 41 90 therefore this new electrode was expected to be employed for practical wastewater purification 3 2 4 coupling with other functional materials other functional materials like polymers and ionic liquid are also advantageous in modifying the characteristics of a pbo2 electrode 94 96 yu et al 96 reported a ionic liquid 1 ethyl 3 methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate emim bf4 modified pbo2 electrode prepared by electrodeposition approach and it was applied for electrochemical degradation of phenol results indicated that the modified electrode with compact and regular morphology possessed a higher degree of crystallinity and a higher content of oxygen in crystal lattice derived from emim bf4 this resulted in the lower content of oxygen vacancy compared to non modified electrode which decreased the probability of oxygen transferring from more effective oh into less desirable olat at the electrode surface thus significantly enhancing the electrocatalytic activity a novel pbo2 electrode modified with polyvinyl fluoride pvdf marked as pbo2 pvdf was successfully fabricated through co deposition method by li s group 97 the addition of pvdf was found to improve the film morphology increase the oxygen evolution potential oep and to reduce the electrode film impedance as displayed in fig 4 the pbo2 pvdf 2 0 electrode exhibited the best degradation performance of phenol with a stronger oh generation ability smaller charge transfer resistance and longer service lifetime than those of other electrodes a similar research was conducted by li et al using polyvinyl alcohol pva to modify pbo2 electrode for anodic oxidization of acid red g arg 98 the presence of pva could refine the grain size and increase the oxygen evolution potential oep of the electrode hence modifying the pbo2 electrode with novel functional materials is expected to favor for the improvement of electrochemcial properties 4 anodic oxidation mechanisms for pbo2 based electrodes 4 1 direct oxidization the anodic oxidation process is strongly dependent on the thermodynamic properties of the electrode material as discussed above pbo2 with superior electrochemical and thermodynamic properties is suitable for treatment of refractory organics in wastewater the direct exchange of electrons between the anode material and the organic compounds at the interface is designated as direct oxidation this occurs only when the applied electric potential is within the regime of water stability when the operating potential exceeds 2 3 vshe 99 representing the occurrence of water decomposition hydroxyl radicals oh are observed to form it is in this potential range that the degradation mechanism transfers from direct to indirect oxidization which accounts for the majority of published literatures 4 2 indirect oxidization on electrolysis species generated by the discharge of water hydroxyl radical hydrogen peroxide ozone react with themselves or with the electrolytes to produce active oxidants these oxidants are utilized in the oxidation of organics and this type of oxidation is referred as indirect oxidation different electrolytes clo4 no3 po4 2 so4 2 co3 2 and br could be found in any industrial effluent and chloride salts cl are most common electrochemically generated active chlorine species efficiently oxidize the organics as follows 1 2 cl cl 2 2 e 2 cl 2 h 2 o hocl h cl 3 hocl h ocl 4 r ocl intermediates c o 2 h 2 o cl although the degradation efficiency in presence of cl ions is found to be better than that achieved in the presence of other electrolytes the generated aoxs are toxic and recalcitrant to degradation while the formed clo reduces the service life of the metal oxide anode therefore the majority of current works use sulfate ions as the electrolyte and the degradation mechanism by active sulfate species is anologous to that of active chlorine species described above on the other hand in most cases hydroxyl radicals oh palys the dominant role in degradation of target organci pollutants in a typical the degradation process hydroxyl radicals generate on the surface of the electrode by water decomposition these radicals weakly absorbed on the pbo2 suface and the majority of them are free in the electrolyte because pbo2 is a non active electrode pbo2 works as an inert electron sink for the removal of electrons from targeted organics while the free hydroxyl radicals react with the organics achieving the degradation 5 pb o 2 h 2 o pb o 2 oh h e 6 pb o 2 oh r pb o 2 c o 2 h 2 o the undesirable oxygen evolution reaction oer is greatly lessened with pbo2 electrode it can proceed as follows 7 oh o h e 8 2 o o 2 9 2 oh h 2 o 2 10 h 2 o 2 o 2 2 h 2 e as discussed above it is the weak absorption properties of hydroxyl radicals on the pbo2 suface that lead to the efficient degradation of various toxic organics 5 conclusions and future perspectives in summary recent progress on the prepartion properties and degradation mechanism of pbo2 based electrodes favorable for treatment of harmful organics is summarized with a focus on various modifying strategies to improve the electrocatalytic performance the currently available research has demonstrates the appropriateness of pbo2 based electrodes for electrochemical degradation of wastewater contaminants even for highly recalcitrant organic pollutants like microplastics pbo2 based electrodes in many cases are capable of achieving complete miniralization although several influence factors for the electocatalytic perforamance of pbo2 based electrodes i e operating electric current ph temperature initial concentration of the pollutant and the amount of electrolyte are universally observed suitable electrode material is of the greatest significance modifying pbo2 based electrodes with suitable dopants has been reported to be an effective strategy the dopants are diversified in forms including metal elements non metal componants metal oxide and other novel functional materials like polymers and ionic liquid in general these dopants can modify the microcrystal structure and morphology of pbo2 electrodes thus promoting the electrochemical activity nevertheless much more research effort should still be directed into this field either exploring new electrode materials or designing more resonable electrode preparation methods in addition the impact of formed oxidants besides hydroxyl radicals on the degradation pathways of traget organics has been limitedly studied so far and deeper understanding of it is required another imporant research direction is the scale up of pbo2 based electrodes as the majority of reported works are based on experiment scale with a single target organic compound although pbo2 suffers from potential risk of lead leakage an obstacle for the practical application it can be resolved with the appropriate operating conditions and the rapid evolutionized electrode materials eventually it is envisaged that this review will benefit for the better understaning of the electrochemical oxidization of organic pollutants at the surface of pbo2 based electrodes declaration of

13479,pbo2 based electrodes possess the greatest oxygen evolution overpotential range beside boron doped diamond bdd which allowed aqueous solution electrochemical oxidization of hazardous organic contaminants as a non active electrode pbo2 based electrode can generate rich free hydroxyl radicals favorable for the degradation of target pollutants the majority of published review articles to date focuses on the application of bdd electrodes metal oxide mo electrodes or mixed metal oxide mmo for treatment of wastewater however there is an increasingly need for reasonable catalyst design of pbo2 based electrodes because suitable electrode materials fundamentally determine the electrocatalytic performance hence in this review recent advances in properties preparation and degradation mechanism of pbo2 based electrodes are summarized with a focus on various modifying strategies eventually research gaps and future perspectives of pbo2 based electrodes are discussed graphical abstract this review highlights recent advances on engineering approach towards design of pbo2 based electrodes for the anodic oxidation of organic pollutants unlabelled image keywords electrochemical oxidization pbo2 based electrodes modifying strategies organic pollutants 1 introduction nowadays energy crisis and environmental pollution are two major issues facing countries all over the world in particular organic pollutants in wastewater released from various factories including cosmetic paper fabricating printing food and pharmaceutical industries are characteristic of diversity in types and refractoriness 1 8 moreover agriculture plays a pivotal role in the world economy and the ever increased usage of pesticides threatens the safety of our daily drinking water 9 11 to resolve this tough problem a great deal of wastewater treatment technologies such as photocatalysis 12 15 biological degradation 16 18 physical adsorption 19 22 ozone oxidation 23 25 and electrochemical methods 26 30 have been commonly employed among them electrochemical oxidization eo of organic pollutants is recognized as an advanced wastewater treatment method which can achieve complete mineralization of targeted organic pollutants 31 32 eo possesses several prestigious advantages over other conventional treatment methods including ease of operation high degradation efficiency low cost and no secondary waste generation for example the electric power supply acts as the major driving force for the degradation of organic pollutants by eo and it is applicable for treatment of turbid and colored wastewater which is difficult to treat by photocatalysis in addition a significant smaller working area of eo is needed in comparison with that of biological treatment methods 33 besides eo has the advantage of easy control through automation and the absence of additional chemicals necessary to conduct the process such as in the fenton process this is due to the high electric conductivity of industrial wastewaters which usually exceeds 10 ms cm more significantly it is easy to achieve degradation of highly toxic pollutants without secondary waste generation such as consumed adsorbents contaminated residues and ferric hydroxide sludge that occurs during physical adsorption nanofiltration biological methods and fenton reactions however analogous to other previously reported treatment methods eo possesses some shortcomings which are passivation polarization and corrosion of electrodes respectively polarization of electrodes usually occurs when the mass transfer is poor and generated gases accumulate on the electrode surface 34 this will result in the depletion of active species located in the boundary layer of electrodes passivation of electrodes is caused by the inert intermediates that are formed during the oxidization reactions nonetheless polarization and passivation of electrodes can be suppressed by agitation such as using a magnetic stirrer centrifugal pumps or turbulence promoters another issue is the corrosion of electrodes due to the oxidization reactions of the active anode materials and the generation of corrosive products such as chlorine gas and thiosulfate ions to resolve this matter it is of significant necessity to choose appropriate electrode materials or developing novel functional electrode materials to date a variety of eo electrode materials including noble metals like pt or mn 35 36 carbon and graphite 37 38 metal oxide mo and mixed metal oxide mmo 39 42 boron doped diamond bdd 43 47 and other mixed types of electrodes 48 50 have been employed for the wastewater treatment in general they can be classified into two categories namely active electrodes pt iro2 ruo2 and non active electrodes sno2 pbo2 bdd among them the most common electrodes are bdd pbo2 and sno2 because of their high oxygen evolution revolution oer overpotential and superior electrocatalytic performance during the oxidization process of organic pollutants bdd is reported to possess the greatest electrical potential before water decomposition which minimizes the evolution of oxygen or hydrogen and simultaneously allows for the almost complete oxidization of organic pollutants 51 however the preparation process of bdd is far more complicated and expensive which limits its practical application in wastewater purification areas sno2 is also a highly efficient anode material but it is usually prepared by thermal deposition method leading to multi crack surface which brings the poor corrosion resistance ability and short service lifespan 52 by contrast pbo2 has been viewed as the optimal anode material considering its facile preparation inexpensive cost superior corrosion resistance and high hydroxyl radicals oh generation capability as a non active anode direct oxidization of organic pollutants on the surface of pbo2 anode is allowed nevertheless the electrocatalytic efficiency of pure pbo2 anode towards most organic pollutants is poorer than that of bdd and sno2 and requires further promotion consequently pbo2 anode in most cases is used in its doped form for wastewater treatment as adding suitable dopants such as metal elements non metal elements and metal oxide can effectively improve the electrocatalytic activity of pbo2 anode 53 55 a considerable amount of published works over the past two decades suggest the appropriateness of pbo2 based anode for oxidization of refractory organic pollutants previous reviews mainly concentrate on the subject of bdd anodes metal oxide anodes and mmo electrodes with a discussion on the properties preparation methods effects of operating conditions on the electrocatalytic activity and various applications during the electrocatalytic degradation process 51 56 58 however a focused review on the catalyst design of pbo2 based anodes for oxidization of persistent organic pollutants still remains unavailable in the literature as a result in this review we first briefly summarize the already reported synthesis approaches and electrochemical properties of pbo2 based anodes then recent representative articles in regard to the design strategies of pbo2 based anodes are reviewed and discussed in detail table 1 eventually we will offer several future perspectives and stress on the significance of pbo2 based anodes employed for the electrochemical degradation of organic compounds 2 synthesis and properties of pbo2 based electrodes pbo2 based electrodes have been subjected to wide investigation for the remediation of wastewater containing refractory and toxic pollutants due to their superior electrochemical properties suitable for this application generally pbo2 exists in two forms namely orthorhombic α pbo2 with brown color and β pbo2 with black color in comparison with α pbo2 β pbo2 with a disordered close packed structure possesses a relatively higher conductivity and higher overpotential towards oxygen evolution reactions thus more favorable for the anodic oxidization of organic pollutants furthermore β pbo2 belongs to a non active anode characteristic of chemical inertness low cost high

dopants 59 75 77 xia et al 77 reported a novel nickel doped pbo2 electrode prepared via electrodeposition in nitrate solution and the optimal doping amount of nickel was discovered to be 1 with a more compact pbo2 film and the diminished size of crystal grains this new electrode possessed the highest kinetic rate constant chemical oxygen demand cod and total organic carbon toc removals which were 1 41 1 22 and 1 20 times than those of pure pbo2 electrode respectively thus showing superior electrocatalytic oxidization of aspirin similar effect was observed for co doped pbo2 studied by wang et al 75 which showed outstanding hydrophilicity and electrical conductivity owing to the improvement of its microcrystal structure in another work the addition of cu into pbo2 electrode remarkably enhanced the electrocatalytic performance 76 the as prepared cu doped pbo2 electrode were used for the electrooxidization degradation of pharmaceutical wastewater that contains amoxicillin shown in fig 2 a was the combustion efficiency of electrochemical oxidation of amoxicillin at two different electrodes under the optimal operating conditions the combustion efficiency of cu pbo2 electrode was 98 4 while that of non doped pbo2 electrode was 65 6 as a result the enhanced combustion efficiency togerther with the increased hydroxyl radicals accounted for the more efficient amoxicillin degradation in addition rare earth metals like yb er nd and ce have also been regarded as prominent dopants for modifying the electrochemical properties of pbo2 electrode due to their unique characteristics 53 78 80 apart from single atom doping two or more metal elements co doping can also significantly promote the electrocatalytic performance of pbo2 electrode 81 85 for instance pan et al 81 successfully fabricated cerium ce and neodymium nd co doped lead dioxide pbo2 electrode via conventional electrodeposition technique and it was further applied for methyl orange mo degradation the obtained co doped electrode possessed smaller crystal sizes more compact structure and higher electrocatalytic activity than those of the single doped and undoped pbo2 electrodes as illustrated in fig 2 among the four types of electrodes the as prepared ce nd pbo2 electrode showed the highest oxygen evolution potential oep lowest charge transfer resistance longest service lifetime and highest mo removal rate additionally it exihibited the lower energy consumption than the other three kinds of electrodes similarly dai and his group reported a novel la y pbo2 electrode prepared by electrodeposition method which was employed for electrocatalytic degradation of aspirin 82 in comparison with non doped and single element doped electrodes the la y pbo2 electrode displayed a more compact surface with a smaller microcrystal grain size simultaneouly generating more active oxygen species besides the larger the electrochemical active surface area the higher apparent rate constant mass transport and current efficiency leaded to the superior degradation performance towards aspirin consequently co doping strategy has been validated to effectively promote the electrocatalytic performance of pbo2 based electrodes 3 2 2 non metal doping non metal dopants like phosphorus p fluorine f graphite and nano diamond possess specific merits and incorporating them into the targeted catalysts can effectively modify their nanostructure and electrochemical properties furthermore several published papers have proved the effectiveness of introducing non metal elements as dopants into pbo2 electrodes 54 74 86 87 dargahi et al 54 used an anodic oxidization approach to successfully prepare graphite doped pbo2 anode for electrochemical degradation of methylene blue mb and practical textile wastewater under the optimal experimental conditions the removal ratio of mb reached 96 4 and the kinetic coefficient of electrochemical mb removal by the graphite doped pbo2 anode was about 2 62 times higher than that of pure graphite anode which corresponded to the pseudo first order kinetic model as reported by li and his coauthors 87 a novel phosphorus doped pbo2 electrode was prepared by a simple and inexpensive electrochemical method for the first time this new electrode showed better electrocatalytic performance than the non doped pbo2 electrode in another work a nano diamond doped pbo2 anode with reduced ti nanotube as the interlayer was successfully prepared and it was utilized for electrochemical degradation of bentazon 74 distinctive from other dopants nano diamond can act as the active sites itself and simultaneously facilitate the electrodeposition of pbo2 by the formation of negatively charged pb2 nano diamond complex the average current efficiency of this anode reached 30 1 5 times higher than that of non doped pbo2 anode which is ascribed to the higher oxygen evolution overpotential larger active area and samller charge transfer resistance however the majority of pbo2 based electrodes are fabricated via anodic oidization method thus limited to several non metal element doping and published papers related to it are far less than that of metal element doping nevertheless one can introduce the non metal elements into pbo2 powder through other methods like hydrothermal method before coating it into the substrate of the electrode as a result much more effort is expected to be devoted to non metal element doping into pbo2 electrode for improving their pollutant degradation efficiency 3 2 3 metal oxide doping in the last two decades mixed metal oxide mmo electrodes have contributed substantially in electrocatalysis showing distinctive advantages over other electrodes i e high electrochemical stability inexpensive cost and long service lifetime a great deal of reasearch work has reported the effectiveness of metal oxide as the dopant for improving the electrocatalytic performance of pbo2 electrodes 88 91 yao et al 91 prepared pbo2 ceo2 nanocomposite electrodes by traditional electrodeposition method in the lead nitrate solution containing ceo2 nanoparticles in comparison with non doped and ce doped pbo2 electrode this composite electrode possessed higher oer overpotential and longer service lifetime 135 h with the malachite green mg and chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency up to 95 4 and 69 3 respectively moreover teng and his coauthors 92 studied the corrosion resistance performance of pbo2 zro2 electrode with sodium chloride as the electrolyte it was found that pbo2 zro2 electrode with a more compact and smooth surface possessed stronger corrosion resistance and longer lifespan 146 h more recently zhang et al 93 have fabricated a new ti pbo2 sm2o3 composite electrode by a facile electrodeposition method leading to a high electrocatalytic activity towards treatment of wastewater containing alizarin yellow r ayr this composite electrode stacked by typical pyramid like microparticles exhibits smooth and compact surface morphology which is conducive to promoting the corrosion resistance fig 3 besides the accelerated lifetime of the ti pbo2 sm2o3 composite electrode 22 h is 1 7 times more than that of the ti pbo2 electrode 13 h and the cod and ayr removal efficiency of ti pbo2 sm2o3 composite electrode reached 79 90 and 80 00 respectively far greater than those of ti pbo2 electrode 39 00 and 41 90 therefore this new electrode was expected to be employed for practical wastewater purification 3 2 4 coupling with other functional materials other functional materials like polymers and ionic liquid are also advantageous in modifying the characteristics of a pbo2 electrode 94 96 yu et al 96 reported a ionic liquid 1 ethyl 3 methyl imidazolium tetrafluoroborate emim bf4 modified pbo2 electrode prepared by electrodeposition approach and it was applied for electrochemical degradation of phenol results indicated that the modified electrode with compact and regular morphology possessed a higher degree of crystallinity and a higher content of oxygen in crystal lattice derived from emim bf4 this resulted in the lower content of oxygen vacancy compared to non modified electrode which decreased the probability of oxygen transferring from more effective oh into less desirable olat at the electrode surface thus significantly enhancing the electrocatalytic activity a novel pbo2 electrode modified with polyvinyl fluoride pvdf marked as pbo2 pvdf was successfully fabricated through co deposition method by li s group 97 the addition of pvdf was found to improve the film morphology increase the oxygen evolution potential oep and to reduce the electrode film impedance as displayed in fig 4 the pbo2 pvdf 2 0 electrode exhibited the best degradation performance of phenol with a stronger oh generation ability smaller charge transfer resistance and longer service lifetime than those of other electrodes a similar research was conducted by li et al using polyvinyl alcohol pva to modify pbo2 electrode for anodic oxidization of acid red g arg 98 the presence of pva could refine the grain size and increase the oxygen evolution potential oep of the electrode hence modifying the pbo2 electrode with novel functional materials is expected to favor for the improvement of electrochemcial properties 4 anodic oxidation mechanisms for pbo2 based electrodes 4 1 direct oxidization the anodic oxidation process is strongly dependent on the thermodynamic properties of the electrode material as discussed above pbo2 with superior electrochemical and thermodynamic properties is suitable for treatment of refractory organics in wastewater the direct exchange of electrons between the anode material and the organic compounds at the interface is designated as direct oxidation this occurs only when the applied electric potential is within the regime of water stability when the operating potential exceeds 2 3 vshe 99 representing the occurrence of water decomposition hydroxyl radicals oh are observed to form it is in this potential range that the degradation mechanism transfers from direct to indirect oxidization which accounts for the majority of published literatures 4 2 indirect oxidization on electrolysis species generated by the discharge of water hydroxyl radical hydrogen peroxide ozone react with themselves or with the electrolytes to produce active oxidants these oxidants are utilized in the oxidation of organics and this type of oxidation is referred as indirect oxidation different electrolytes clo4 no3 po4 2 so4 2 co3 2 and br could be found in any industrial effluent and chloride salts cl are most common electrochemically generated active chlorine species efficiently oxidize the organics as follows 1 2 cl cl 2 2 e 2 cl 2 h 2 o hocl h cl 3 hocl h ocl 4 r ocl intermediates c o 2 h 2 o cl although the degradation efficiency in presence of cl ions is found to be better than that achieved in the presence of other electrolytes the generated aoxs are toxic and recalcitrant to degradation while the formed clo reduces the service life of the metal oxide anode therefore the majority of current works use sulfate ions as the electrolyte and the degradation mechanism by active sulfate species is anologous to that of active chlorine species described above on the other hand in most cases hydroxyl radicals oh palys the dominant role in degradation of target organci pollutants in a typical the degradation process hydroxyl radicals generate on the surface of the electrode by water decomposition these radicals weakly absorbed on the pbo2 suface and the majority of them are free in the electrolyte because pbo2 is a non active electrode pbo2 works as an inert electron sink for the removal of electrons from targeted organics while the free hydroxyl radicals react with the organics achieving the degradation 5 pb o 2 h 2 o pb o 2 oh h e 6 pb o 2 oh r pb o 2 c o 2 h 2 o the undesirable oxygen evolution reaction oer is greatly lessened with pbo2 electrode it can proceed as follows 7 oh o h e 8 2 o o 2 9 2 oh h 2 o 2 10 h 2 o 2 o 2 2 h 2 e as discussed above it is the weak absorption properties of hydroxyl radicals on the pbo2 suface that lead to the efficient degradation of various toxic organics 5 conclusions and future perspectives in summary recent progress on the prepartion properties and degradation mechanism of pbo2 based electrodes favorable for treatment of harmful organics is summarized with a focus on various modifying strategies to improve the electrocatalytic performance the currently available research has demonstrates the appropriateness of pbo2 based electrodes for electrochemical degradation of wastewater contaminants even for highly recalcitrant organic pollutants like microplastics pbo2 based electrodes in many cases are capable of achieving complete miniralization although several influence factors for the electocatalytic perforamance of pbo2 based electrodes i e operating electric current ph temperature initial concentration of the pollutant and the amount of electrolyte are universally observed suitable electrode material is of the greatest significance modifying pbo2 based electrodes with suitable dopants has been reported to be an effective strategy the dopants are diversified in forms including metal elements non metal componants metal oxide and other novel functional materials like polymers and ionic liquid in general these dopants can modify the microcrystal structure and morphology of pbo2 electrodes thus promoting the electrochemical activity nevertheless much more research effort should still be directed into this field either exploring new electrode materials or designing more resonable electrode preparation methods in addition the impact of formed oxidants besides hydroxyl radicals on the degradation pathways of traget organics has been limitedly studied so far and deeper understanding of it is required another imporant research direction is the scale up of pbo2 based electrodes as the majority of reported works are based on experiment scale with a single target organic compound although pbo2 suffers from potential risk of lead leakage an obstacle for the practical application it can be resolved with the appropriate operating conditions and the rapid evolutionized electrode materials eventually it is envisaged that this review will benefit for the better understaning of the electrochemical oxidization of organic pollutants at the surface of pbo2 based electrodes declaration of
