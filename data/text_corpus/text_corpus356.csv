1780,the water erosion prediction project wepp model is a physical process based model that can predict both interrill and rill erosion on hillslopes the interrill erodibility ki is quantified by the soil particle size distribution which is a key parameter in wepp model however the important effects of soil structure on soil erodibility are ignored which seriously affects the prediction accuracy of the model in this study simulated rainfall experiments 60 90 120 mm h 1 were performed to improve the prediction equation of interrill erosion incorporating the aggregate instability index as rare earth elements rees were employed as tracers to distinguish interrill and rill erosion on slopes in a box 2 m long 0 5 m wide 0 4 m deep with gradients of 10 20 and 30 the le bissonnais method was used to determine the soil aggregate stability the results showed that aggregate stability played a crucial role in interrill erosion under similar runoff rates the improved equation contains four parameters as runoff rate q rainfall intensity i and slope gradient sf with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 81 and model efficiency me of 0 79 this equation exhibits greatly improved efficiency in estimating the interrill erosion rate compared to the wepp model furthermore a new equation incorporating the as flow velocity v flow depth h and hydraulic gradient j was developed with r 2 of 0 90 and me of 0 89 this study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism of interrill erosion and improves upon the physical process based soil erosion model keywords interrill erosion aggregate stability hydraulic parameters wepp model rees data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction interrill erosion is one of the most important and most common forms of soil erosion and has been widely studied and many interrill erosion prediction models have been developed foster et al 1977 deduced an equation by analysing the dominant impact factors in which the interrill erosion rate is a power function of soil erodibility rainfall intensity and slope gradient this equation was subsequently improved and employed by the water erosion prediction project wepp model nearing et al 1989 flanagan and nearing 1995 kinnell 1991 suggested integrating the runoff rate into an interrill erosion model considering the transport process of sheet flow in subsequent research the effects of several factors such as slope length rainfall pattern raindrop kinetic energy flow depth and seepage on interrill erosion were studied zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zhang and wang 2017 shin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 which greatly improved the prediction accuracy of interrill erosion in the majority of erosion models developed to date the resistance of soil to raindrop detachment termed interrill erodibility ki was considered a key factor for the prediction of interrill erosion two methods are used to determine ki one method is direct measurement for long term monitoring in the field which is time consuming and costly another method is to calculate by empirical equations provided in the wepp model which were developed based on soil texture information these empirical relationships were developed based on data from specific studied areas and might lead to misestimation when applied to other areas romero et al 2007 yan et al 2008 accordingly it is necessary to establish a valid and easily measurable indicator to replace ki although the soil erosion process is affected by various soil properties such as soil structure cohesion strength topsoil clay and organic matter content directly or indirectly it is widely accepted that the soil structure dominates the response to soil erosion nciizah and wakindiki 2015 vaezi et al 2018 as the fundamental unit of soil structure aggregates not only control the process of raindrop detachment directly but can also be disintegrated into light and easily transportable fine particles which are important subprocesses in interrill erosion ma et al 2014 the feasibility of aggregate stability as a substitute for soil erodibility has been proven in some studies valmis et al 2005 ding and zhang 2016 however this information was obtained at the empirical level and the studies failed to consider the different mechanisms of aggregate breakdown yan et al 2008 the mechanisms of aggregate breakdown include slaking microcracking mechanical breakdown and physical chemical dispersion le bissonnais 1996 slaking and mechanical breakdown are regarded as principal mechanisms accounting for aggregate breakdown during water erosion xiao et al 2017a li et al 2021a yan et al 2008 developed an aggregate instability index as based on the principal mechanisms of aggregate breakdown which can reflect both the sensitivity of soil aggregates to raindrop impact and to slaking shi et al 2010 and xiao et al 2017b used as to replace ki in the wepp model and accurately predicted the interrill erosion rate in ultisols of subtropical china however the applicability of the improved equation was not assessed for different soil types with various textures in addition many hydraulic parameters including flow velocity shear stress stream power and unit stream power were also used to establish the interrill erosion model however the optimal hydraulic parameter and function for quantifying the interrill erosion rate varied with different soil textures and test conditions for example wu et al 2017 and zhang et al 2020 suggested that the stream power linearly changed with the interrill erosion rate guo et al 2020 found a power function between stream power and the interrill erosion rate an et al 2012 concluded that the optimal parameter to estimate the interrill erosion rate was the unit stream power under raindrop impacts this variation may lead to poor predictive efficiency of a single hydraulic parameter to estimate the interrill erosion rate of different soils li et al 2021b found that it was difficult to estimate the interrill erosion rate simultaneously for two types of loess using only a single hydraulic parameter therefore they defined a general flow intensity parameter that is a function of flow velocity flow depth and hydraulic slope which in combination with the median soil grain diameter successfully estimated the interrill erosion rate for the two soils however the median soil grain diameter could not well characterize the difference in susceptibility to erosion for different soils one of the difficulties in establishing an interrill erosion model is to distinguish and quantify interrill and rill erosion on hillslopes during rainfall events zhang et al 2013 some researchers have used mini plots to avoid rill erosion wu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 however the interaction between interrill erosion and rill erosion which occur on hillslopes simultaneously was neglected the tracing technique was verified to be an effective method to partition interrill and rill erosion and many materials were employed as tracers such as rare earth elements rees xiao et al 2017b 7be liu et al 2011 and magnetic material ventura et al 2001 rees are considered ideal tracers due to their low background concentrations in soils environmental safety chemical stability and strong binding with soil particles liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 one centimeter was defined as the threshold depth to distinguish interrill and rill erosion and the various rees were thus placed at different soil depths to trace different soil erosion processes liu et al 2011 wang et al 2020 interrill erosion involves the processes of detachment by raindrops and transport by sheet flow induced by raindrops kinnell 2005 as takes into account the different mechanisms of aggregate breakdown which are crucial in the process of detachment by raindrops thus this study hypothesized that as would be well connected with interrill erosion and would predict interrill erosion rates in combination with runoff rainfall intensity slope steepness as well as hydraulic parameters and the objectives of this study were to i assess the effect of soil aggregate stability on interrill erosion ii evaluate the efficiency of as for estimating the interrill erosion rate and iii develop a new equation for predicting the interrill erosion rate by combining the as and hydraulic parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 soils five loessial soils were collected from the upper 20 cm of farmland at five sites considering the latitudinal distribution and physicochemical properties of the soils in the loess plateau of china table 1 these five loessial soils according to the international soil texture system included i a loamy clay collected from yangling 34 17 n 108 03 e with a mean annual temperature of 12 9 c and a mean annual precipitation of 635 1 mm ii a clay loam collected from changwu 35 13 n 107 41 e with a mean annual temperature of 9 5 and a mean annual precipitation of 584 1 mm iii a silty clay loam collected from wugong 34 25 n 108 04 e with a mean annual temperature of 12 9 and a mean annual precipitation of 633 7 mm iv a sandy loam collected from jingbian 37 22 n 108 49 e with a mean annual temperature of 10 0 and a mean annual precipitation of 443 5 mm and v a sandy loam collected from ansai 36 55 n 108 51 e with a mean annual temperature of 8 8 and a mean annual precipitation of 505 3 mm 2 2 experimental design the rainfall simulation experiments were performed on a slope adjustable metal box 2 m long 0 5 m wide 0 4 m deep at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling china a side spraying simulated rainfall system with a rainfall height of 16 m above the soil surface was used to simulate rainfall two ree oxide powders sm2o3 and ho2o3 were chosen as tracers taking into account the cost and accuracy of the measurement sm2o3 and ho2o3 were homogeneously mixed with a certain amount of soil sample by step by step dilution to obtain predetermined concentrations liu et al 2016 to distinguish interrill and rill erosion the soil tagged with sm2o3 and ho2o3 was filled into the 0 1 cm and 1 20 cm depths of the box at a target bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 respectively the soil was screened through a 5 mm sieve before filling specifically the sand was packed at the bottom of the plots at a depth of 20 cm to ensure free drainage then the subsurface soil 1 20 cm was packed followed by the topsoil 0 1 cm after filling the surface soil was watered with an electric sprayer evika ltd china until saturation to strengthen the adsorption of the ree oxides to soil particles and to ensure the consistency of antecedent soil moisture before each test severe soil erosion is mostly caused by short duration and high intensity rainstorms in the loess plateau of china xin et al 2010 therefore the artificial rainfall intensity was set at 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 and the duration was controlled at 30 min after the generation of runoff the plots were set at 10 20 and 30 which are representative low middle and high slope gradients in the loess plateau zhang et al 2012 considering the change in runoff during the rainfall process wang et al 2018 runoff samples were collected at intervals of 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 and 4 min after runoff initiation surface flow velocities were measured using the ink dye method along two 100 cm segments located in two locations within the box 0 100 cm and 100 200 cm from the top of the box sun et al 2020 the measurement time was in the middle of the collection time of each runoff sample at the end of each test the wet and air dried weights of the collected runoff and sediment samples were weighed to calculate the yield of runoff and sediment 2 3 laboratory analysis soil particle size distribution organic matter content and ph value were measured using a malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd uk the k2cr2o7 oxidation outer heating method zhang and gong 2012 and a ph meter shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd china respectively the methods introduced by li 1997 were used to extract free form fe al oxide and amorphous fe al oxide which were then measured by an icp analyzer vista mpx varian inc palo alto ca usa the le bissonnais method was used to measure soil aggregate stability which includes three treatments fast wetting fw slow wetting sw and wet stirring ws le bissonnais 1996 the aggregates with a particle size of 3 5 mm were heated in a 40 oven for 24 h to make the initial moisture content uniform then the above three treatments were used to simulate the different mechanisms of aggregate breakdown fw a 5 g sample of aggregates was soaked in deionized water for 10 min and then the water was removed by pipette sw a 5 g sample of aggregates was placed on wet filter paper with a tension of 0 3 kpa for 30 min to completely wet the aggregates ws a 5 g sample of aggregates soaked in ethanol for 10 min was placed in a flask containing 200 ml of deionized water and then shaken 20 times the mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min and then the water was removed by pipette these three samples from the above treatments were transferred to a 0 05 mm sieve soaked in alcohol and shaken 20 times the remaining sample of aggregates on the sieve was heated at 40 in an oven for 48 h and then passed through sieves with pore sizes of 2 mm 1 mm 0 5 mm 0 2 mm 0 1 mm and 0 05 mm to obtain their size distribution each treatment was repeated 3 times rees were extracted from all tagged soil and sediment samples using strong acid extraction in short they were adsorbed with soil particles and extracted repeatedly using hno3 68 by weight and hf 48 by weight and the concentration of extracted rees was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry x series ⅱ icp ms thermo fisher scientific us detailed operations were reported by liu et al 2016 and each procedure was repeated twice 2 4 calculation the mass of eroded soil from the interrill area and rill area were calculated as follows 1 q 0 75 i 0 017 c l a y 0 0088 s a n d 0 02 r 2 0

cs and ch are the applied concentrations of sm2o3 and ho2o3 tracer element in soil mg kg 1 respectively the mean weight diameter mwd was calculated to express the stability of the soil aggregates under the three treatments as follows 3 mwd i 0 n x i m i where xi is the average diameter of each aggregate size and mi is the mass percentage of each aggregate size the relative slaking index rsi and the relative mechanical breakdown index rmi can characterize the susceptivity of soil aggregates to slaking and mechanical breakdown respectively as is an integrated index incorporating the rsi

the soil particle size distribution for calculation ki is determined by using the classic sedimentation method thus the conversion model developed by yang et al 2009 was employed to convert the measurement results of the laser diffraction method to sedimentation method 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were undertaken using spss 21 0 software spss inc chicago il usa one way analysis of variance one way anova followed by the least significant difference lsd test was used to compare the differences in runoff rate and soil aggregate stability among different soils pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between variables and influencing factors regression analysis was used to develop equations specifically the test data were randomly split into two groups one group n 30 was used to develop new equations and another group n 15 was used to evaluate and validate the newly developed equations the performance of the new equations was

sediment yield as shown in fig 1 the runoff rate increased with increasing rainfall intensity under given slope gradients the rainfall intensity increased from 60 mm h 1 to 120 mm h 1 and the runoff rates of the loamy clay clay loam silty clay loam sandy loam 1 and sandy loam 2 treatments increased by 102 30 85 14 128 48 196 37 and 148 14 respectively however the slope gradient had no significant effect on the runoff rate table 2 and a slightly decreasing tendency could be observed with increasing slope gradients overall the mean runoff rate of loamy clay clay loam and silty clay loam soils were obviously greater than those of sandy loam 1 and sandy loam 2 runoff generation is closely associated with soil texture table 2 indicates that the runoff rate was strongly positively related to rainfall intensity clay and silt p 0 01 and negatively related to sand p 0 01 while it was not strongly related to slope gradient p 0 05 therefore linear regression analysis was performed to explore the relationships among the runoff rate q and the main influential factors including rainfall intensity i clay and sand 19 q 0 75 i 0 017 c l a y 0 0088 s a n d 0 02 r 2 0 93 m e 0 92 the variations in interrill and rill erosion rates with rainfall duration under different experimental conditions are shown in fig 2 obvious rill erosion was found in all test conditions with the exception of 10 and 60 mm h 1 and its occurrence was advanced with increasing rainfall intensity the interrill erosion rate increased and then tended to be stable while the rill erosion rate gradually increased with the development of rills as a whole interrill erosion was the dominant erosion type and accounted for 80 of erosion the interrill erosion rate was in the following order silty clay loam clay loam loamy clay sandy loam 2 sandy loam 1 in addition as the slope gradient increased from 10 to 30 the average interrill erosion rates of loamy clay clay loam silty clay loam sandy loam 1 and sandy loam 2 increased by 1 63 1 79 1 27 1 73 and 2 23 times respectively these values increased by 2 91 3 01 3 26 9 12 and 5 98 times as the rainfall intensity increased from 60 mm h 1 to 120 mm h 1 respectively 3 2 soil aggregates and interrill erosion rate the mwdfw mwdsw and mwdws of the five soils varied from 0 097 to 0 43 mm from 0 39 to 2 65 mm and from 0 17 to 2 11 mm respectively table 3 significant differences among the mwdsw of the five soils and among the mwdfw and mwdws of the four soil textures were found loamy clay had the largest mwd values and sandy loam had the smallest mwd values this result indicated that the soil aggregates of loamy clay were the most stable and those of sandy loam were the least stable the mwd values for the same soil ranked from higher to lower as mwdsw mwdws mwdfw unlike the rsi the rmi and as were significantly different among the five soils and both showed the following order loamy clay clay loam silty clay loam sandy loam 1 sandy loam 2 mwdfw mwdsw and mwdws were positively correlated with clay p 0 01 as well as free from fe contents p 0 05 fig 3 they were negatively correlated with sand p 0 05 and weakly correlated with organic matter and other fe al hydr oxide contents p 0 05 rmi and as were significantly and negatively correlated with clay p 0 01 while rsi was positively correlated with clay p 0 079 the as is an integrated indicator considering the main mechanisms of aggregate breakdown based on randomly selected data n 30 in this study an improved equation was developed using as instead of ki as shown in eq 20 20 di 0 16 a s q i s f r 2 0 73 m e 0 71 3 3 hydraulic parameter characteristics and interrill erosion rate the variations in shear stress stream power and unit stream power for the five soils under different experimental conditions are shown in table 4 apparently the three hydraulic parameters increased with both rainfall intensity and slope gradient as the slope gradient increased from 10 to 30 the shear stress stream power and unit stream power increased by 110 73 150 11 and 249 33 on average respectively these parameters increased by 46 53 118 16 and 49 12 as the rainfall intensity increased from 60 mm h 1 to 120 mm h 1 respectively these findings indicated that hydraulic parameters were more sensitive to slope gradients than to rainfall intensity the relationships between the interrill erosion rate and the three hydraulic parameters are as follows fig 4 21 di 0 041 τ 0 018 r 2 0 34 m e 0 34 p 0 01 22 di 0 58 ω 0 0033 r 2 0 66 m e 0 66 p 0 01 23 di 1 23 p 0 026 r 2 0 27 m e 0 27 p 0 01 the three hydraulic parameters were highly correlated with the interrill erosion rate p 0 01 while r2 and me revealed the poor accuracy obtained with the use of a single hydraulic parameter for predicting the interrill erosion rate of five soils r2 0 8 me 0 7 different soils have different resistances to raindrop and sheet flow thus both soil and hydraulic parameters should be employed to model the interrill erosion rate additionally a general flow parameter can be derived from the flow velocity v flow depth h and hydraulic slope j li et al 2021b therefore multiple regression analysis was conducted on as v h and j and a new model of interrill erosion was obtained 24 di 142 79 a s 0 60 v 1 96 h 1 57 j 0 65 r 2 0 92 m e 0 92 3 4 evaluation and validation of the equation the ki calculated by eqs 12 and 13 was substituted into eq 11 to obtain the estimated values of the interrill erosion rate as shown in fig 5 a the values estimated by the wepp model were 2 01 times higher on average than the measured values of the interrill erosion rate me 0 also indicated that the estimated values greatly differed from the measured values the remaining data n 15 were used for model evaluation and validation fig 5b illustrates that eq 20 including as q i and sf greatly improve the prediction efficiency of the wepp model apparently r 2 reached 0 81 good r 2 0 80 revealing that di was highly correlated with as q i and sf and me reached 0 79 good me 0 70 revealing that the model was valid therefore eq 20 was capable of estimating the interrill erosion rate as shown in fig 5c the values estimated by eq 24 were very close to the measured values the statistical parameters r 2 0 90 me 0 89 rmse 0 016 ave 7 82 showed that the prediction efficiency of the interrill erosion rate was further improved when the model combined aggregate stability and hydraulic parameters 4 discussion 4 1 the factors controlling aggregate stability the mwd values of the five soils decreased in the sequence mwdsw mwdws mwdfw under the three treatments table 3 this indicated that slaking by rapid wetting was the main cause of the breakdown of aggregates followed by mechanical breakdown due to raindrop impact this finding was consistent with the reports of xiao et al 2017a and li et al 2021a who measured the aggregate stability of different soils using the same method generally soil clay and organic matter have the function of cementation which contribute to the formation of soil aggregates and increase aggregate stability six et al 2000 wuddivira et al 2009 xue et al 2019 however the aggregate stability had a positive correlation with clay but not with organic matter in this study fig 3 le bissonnais et al 2007 pointed out that aggregate stability was mainly controlled by clay when the organic matter content was lower than 15 g kg 1 the organic matter content of the tested soils was lower than the threshold except for silty clay loam resulting in the clay predominantly controlling the aggregate stability likewise the low fe al oxide content led to a weak correlation between fe al oxide and aggregate stability unexpectedly clay showed a significant negative correlation with rmi and as but a positive correlation with rsi this may be attributed to the increased inconsistency of mwdfw mwdws and mwdsw with increasing clay content xiao et al 2018 4 2 effect of soil aggregate stability on interrill erosion soil aggregate stability as an important indicator of soil structure has been considered to dominate the erosion process according to previous studies more stable soil aggregates are corresponded with a lower erosion rate yan et al 2008 xiao et al 2017b however loamy clay clay loam and silty clay loam with more stable aggregates had greater interrill erosion rates than sandy loam with less stable aggregates in the present study sun et al 2021 fang et al 2008 and chen et al 2013 found this same phenomenon in simulated rainfall experiment on different soils on the loess plateau of china this observation could be attributed to the difference in runoff rate of the tested soils chen et al 2013 interrill erosion is the result of the interaction between detachment by raindrops and transportation by sheet flow and the interrill erosion rate is determined by weaker processes kinnell 2005 xiao et al 2018 depending on the postulation of martinezmena et al 2002 a negative correlation between runoff rate and sediment concentration indicated a detachment limiting condition while the opposite signified a transport limiting condition fig 6 indicates that the transport limiting process was the dominant erosion mechanism in this study as positive correlations were found between sediment concentration and runoff rate therefore it could be deduced that the predetached soil particles by raindrops were deposited on the slope surface due to the inadequate transport capacity of sheet flow more runoff means greater transport capacity wang et al 2019 thus loamy clay clay loam and silty clay loam had greater interrill erosion rates than sandy loam soil aggregate stability plays a crucial role in interrill erosion under similar runoff rates for loamy clay clay loam and silty clay loam the average runoff rates were 1 20 1 25 and 1 11 mm min 1 respectively and no significant difference was found among them fig 1 therefore silty clay loam with the least stable aggregates among the three soils had the greatest interrill erosion rate similarly the interrill erosion rate of sandy loam 1 with less stable aggregates was greater than that of sandy loam 2 4 3 evaluation of the interrill erosion equation incorporating as the interrill erosion rate estimated by the wepp model was significantly different from the measured interrill erosion rate and similar findings were obtained by duiker et al 2001 ki is a comprehensive function of soil physicochemical properties and can vary within a standard texture romero et al 2007 however the calculation of ki ignored the influence of the soil structure especially the aggregate stability a study in semiarid areas also showed that the information on soil particle composition was inadequate to quantify ki vaezi et al 2018 this resulted in the poor efficiency in predicting the interrill erosion rate in the wepp model as is an integrated indicator considering the main mechanisms of aggregate breakdown which in turn is is an important process for raindrop detachment ma et al 2014 xiao et al 2018 therefore as could well characterize the process of raindrop detachment furthermore the higher efficiency of eq 20 than eq 11 for predicting the interrill erosion rate validates the hypothesis in this study in this study the shear stress stream power and unit stream power were used to estimate the interrill erosion rate this result was consistent with some earlier findings cao et al 2015 wang et al 2018 guo et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 our results also indicated that stream power was the optimal hydraulic parameter for estimating the interrill erosion rate unfortunately r 2 and me showed that the predicted efficiency of the three hydraulic parameters was unsatisfactory on the one hand this may be attributed to the difference in the optimal hydraulic parameters and conditions for quantifying interrill erosion rates of different soils li et al 2021b on the other hand water erosion is affected not only by flow but also by soil properties liu et al 2020 in this study eq 24 combined as and general flow intensity parameters to achieve satisfactory prediction efficiency with r 2 0 90 me 0 89 rmse 0 016 and ave 7 82 fig 5c as the basic hydrological parameters v h and j can well characterize the transport ability of sheet flow and h also plays an important role in rainfall splash kinnell 1991 gabet and dunne 2003 by incorporating as the eq 24 takes into account both the detachment and transport processes of interrill erosion and thus has better prediction efficiency than eq 20 it is noteworthy that eq 24 was established based on indoor tests and the tested soil structure was inevitably damaged during sampling and filling therefore it is necessary to validate the newly developed equation for undisturbed soil in the field for calibration 5 conclusions in this study the simulated rainfall and ree tracing methods were used to quantify the interrill erosion rate of five soils the results demonstrated that the interrill erosion rate of the tested soils increased both with rainfall intensity and slope gradient and the tested soils ranked in the following order in terms of interrill erosion rate silty clay loam clay loam loamy clay sandy loam 1 sandy loam 2 due to the difference in runoff rate loamy clay clay loam and silty clay loam with more stable aggregates had greater interrill erosion rates than sandy loam the equation including as q i and sf greatly improved the prediction accuracy of the interrill erosion compared to the wepp model the interrill erosion rate increased linearly with shear stress stream power and unit stream power however equations including single hydraulic parameters cannot achieve satisfactory prediction efficiency r 2 0 8 me 0 7 the newly developed equation combining as and the general flow intensity parameters could accurately estimate the interrill erosion rate with high r 2 0 90 and me 0 89 and low rmse 0 016 and ave 7 82 the equation indicated that the interrill erosion rate increased as as v h and j increased in power function and the exponents were 0 60 1 96 1 57 and 0 65 respectively this study showed that as is an appropriate indicator to characterize the susceptibility of soil to raindrop detachment however the runoff process should also be incorporated into interrill erosion prediction models these results are helpful for further understanding the mechanisms of interrill erosion and improving the prediction accuracy credit authorship

1780,the water erosion prediction project wepp model is a physical process based model that can predict both interrill and rill erosion on hillslopes the interrill erodibility ki is quantified by the soil particle size distribution which is a key parameter in wepp model however the important effects of soil structure on soil erodibility are ignored which seriously affects the prediction accuracy of the model in this study simulated rainfall experiments 60 90 120 mm h 1 were performed to improve the prediction equation of interrill erosion incorporating the aggregate instability index as rare earth elements rees were employed as tracers to distinguish interrill and rill erosion on slopes in a box 2 m long 0 5 m wide 0 4 m deep with gradients of 10 20 and 30 the le bissonnais method was used to determine the soil aggregate stability the results showed that aggregate stability played a crucial role in interrill erosion under similar runoff rates the improved equation contains four parameters as runoff rate q rainfall intensity i and slope gradient sf with a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 81 and model efficiency me of 0 79 this equation exhibits greatly improved efficiency in estimating the interrill erosion rate compared to the wepp model furthermore a new equation incorporating the as flow velocity v flow depth h and hydraulic gradient j was developed with r 2 of 0 90 and me of 0 89 this study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism of interrill erosion and improves upon the physical process based soil erosion model keywords interrill erosion aggregate stability hydraulic parameters wepp model rees data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction interrill erosion is one of the most important and most common forms of soil erosion and has been widely studied and many interrill erosion prediction models have been developed foster et al 1977 deduced an equation by analysing the dominant impact factors in which the interrill erosion rate is a power function of soil erodibility rainfall intensity and slope gradient this equation was subsequently improved and employed by the water erosion prediction project wepp model nearing et al 1989 flanagan and nearing 1995 kinnell 1991 suggested integrating the runoff rate into an interrill erosion model considering the transport process of sheet flow in subsequent research the effects of several factors such as slope length rainfall pattern raindrop kinetic energy flow depth and seepage on interrill erosion were studied zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zhang and wang 2017 shin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 which greatly improved the prediction accuracy of interrill erosion in the majority of erosion models developed to date the resistance of soil to raindrop detachment termed interrill erodibility ki was considered a key factor for the prediction of interrill erosion two methods are used to determine ki one method is direct measurement for long term monitoring in the field which is time consuming and costly another method is to calculate by empirical equations provided in the wepp model which were developed based on soil texture information these empirical relationships were developed based on data from specific studied areas and might lead to misestimation when applied to other areas romero et al 2007 yan et al 2008 accordingly it is necessary to establish a valid and easily measurable indicator to replace ki although the soil erosion process is affected by various soil properties such as soil structure cohesion strength topsoil clay and organic matter content directly or indirectly it is widely accepted that the soil structure dominates the response to soil erosion nciizah and wakindiki 2015 vaezi et al 2018 as the fundamental unit of soil structure aggregates not only control the process of raindrop detachment directly but can also be disintegrated into light and easily transportable fine particles which are important subprocesses in interrill erosion ma et al 2014 the feasibility of aggregate stability as a substitute for soil erodibility has been proven in some studies valmis et al 2005 ding and zhang 2016 however this information was obtained at the empirical level and the studies failed to consider the different mechanisms of aggregate breakdown yan et al 2008 the mechanisms of aggregate breakdown include slaking microcracking mechanical breakdown and physical chemical dispersion le bissonnais 1996 slaking and mechanical breakdown are regarded as principal mechanisms accounting for aggregate breakdown during water erosion xiao et al 2017a li et al 2021a yan et al 2008 developed an aggregate instability index as based on the principal mechanisms of aggregate breakdown which can reflect both the sensitivity of soil aggregates to raindrop impact and to slaking shi et al 2010 and xiao et al 2017b used as to replace ki in the wepp model and accurately predicted the interrill erosion rate in ultisols of subtropical china however the applicability of the improved equation was not assessed for different soil types with various textures in addition many hydraulic parameters including flow velocity shear stress stream power and unit stream power were also used to establish the interrill erosion model however the optimal hydraulic parameter and function for quantifying the interrill erosion rate varied with different soil textures and test conditions for example wu et al 2017 and zhang et al 2020 suggested that the stream power linearly changed with the interrill erosion rate guo et al 2020 found a power function between stream power and the interrill erosion rate an et al 2012 concluded that the optimal parameter to estimate the interrill erosion rate was the unit stream power under raindrop impacts this variation may lead to poor predictive efficiency of a single hydraulic parameter to estimate the interrill erosion rate of different soils li et al 2021b found that it was difficult to estimate the interrill erosion rate simultaneously for two types of loess using only a single hydraulic parameter therefore they defined a general flow intensity parameter that is a function of flow velocity flow depth and hydraulic slope which in combination with the median soil grain diameter successfully estimated the interrill erosion rate for the two soils however the median soil grain diameter could not well characterize the difference in susceptibility to erosion for different soils one of the difficulties in establishing an interrill erosion model is to distinguish and quantify interrill and rill erosion on hillslopes during rainfall events zhang et al 2013 some researchers have used mini plots to avoid rill erosion wu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 however the interaction between interrill erosion and rill erosion which occur on hillslopes simultaneously was neglected the tracing technique was verified to be an effective method to partition interrill and rill erosion and many materials were employed as tracers such as rare earth elements rees xiao et al 2017b 7be liu et al 2011 and magnetic material ventura et al 2001 rees are considered ideal tracers due to their low background concentrations in soils environmental safety chemical stability and strong binding with soil particles liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 one centimeter was defined as the threshold depth to distinguish interrill and rill erosion and the various rees were thus placed at different soil depths to trace different soil erosion processes liu et al 2011 wang et al 2020 interrill erosion involves the processes of detachment by raindrops and transport by sheet flow induced by raindrops kinnell 2005 as takes into account the different mechanisms of aggregate breakdown which are crucial in the process of detachment by raindrops thus this study hypothesized that as would be well connected with interrill erosion and would predict interrill erosion rates in combination with runoff rainfall intensity slope steepness as well as hydraulic parameters and the objectives of this study were to i assess the effect of soil aggregate stability on interrill erosion ii evaluate the efficiency of as for estimating the interrill erosion rate and iii develop a new equation for predicting the interrill erosion rate by combining the as and hydraulic parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 soils five loessial soils were collected from the upper 20 cm of farmland at five sites considering the latitudinal distribution and physicochemical properties of the soils in the loess plateau of china table 1 these five loessial soils according to the international soil texture system included i a loamy clay collected from yangling 34 17 n 108 03 e with a mean annual temperature of 12 9 c and a mean annual precipitation of 635 1 mm ii a clay loam collected from changwu 35 13 n 107 41 e with a mean annual temperature of

sandy loam collected from jingbian 37 22 n 108 49 e with a mean annual temperature of 10 0 and a mean annual precipitation of 443 5 mm and v a sandy loam collected from ansai 36 55 n 108 51 e with a mean annual temperature of 8 8 and a mean annual precipitation of 505 3 mm 2 2 experimental design the rainfall simulation experiments were performed on a slope adjustable metal box 2 m long 0 5 m wide 0 4 m deep at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling china a side spraying simulated rainfall system with a rainfall height of 16 m above the soil surface was used to simulate rainfall two ree oxide powders sm2o3 and ho2o3 were chosen as tracers taking into account the cost and accuracy of the measurement sm2o3 and ho2o3 were homogeneously mixed with a certain amount of soil sample by step by step dilution to obtain predetermined concentrations liu et al 2016 to distinguish interrill and rill erosion the soil tagged with sm2o3 and ho2o3 was filled into the 0 1 cm and 1 20 cm depths of the box at a target bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 respectively the soil was screened through a 5 mm sieve before filling specifically the sand was packed at the bottom of the plots at a depth of 20 cm to ensure free drainage then the subsurface soil 1 20 cm was packed followed by the topsoil 0 1 cm after filling the surface soil was watered with an electric sprayer evika ltd china until saturation to strengthen the adsorption of the ree oxides to soil particles and to ensure the consistency of antecedent soil moisture before each test severe soil erosion is mostly caused by short duration and high intensity rainstorms in the loess plateau of china xin et al 2010 therefore the artificial rainfall intensity was set at 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 and the duration was controlled at 30 min after the generation of runoff the plots were set at 10 20 and 30 which are representative low middle and high slope gradients in the loess plateau zhang et al 2012 considering the change in runoff during the rainfall process wang et al 2018 runoff samples were collected at intervals of 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 and 4 min after runoff initiation surface flow velocities were measured using the ink dye method along two 100 cm segments located in two locations within the box 0 100 cm and 100 200 cm from the top of the box sun et al 2020 the measurement time was in the middle of the collection time of each runoff sample at the end of each test the wet and air dried weights of the collected runoff and sediment samples were weighed to calculate the yield of runoff and sediment 2 3 laboratory analysis soil particle size distribution organic matter content and ph value were measured using a malvern laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd uk the k2cr2o7 oxidation outer heating method zhang and gong 2012 and a ph meter shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd china respectively the methods introduced by li 1997 were used to extract free form fe al oxide and amorphous fe al oxide which were then measured by an icp analyzer vista mpx varian inc palo alto ca usa the le bissonnais method was used to measure soil aggregate stability which includes three treatments fast wetting fw slow wetting sw and wet stirring ws le bissonnais 1996 the aggregates with a particle size of 3 5 mm were heated in a 40 oven for 24 h to make the initial moisture content uniform then the above three treatments were used to simulate the different mechanisms of aggregate breakdown fw a 5 g sample of aggregates was soaked in deionized water for 10 min and then the water was removed by pipette sw a 5 g sample of aggregates was placed on wet filter paper with a tension of 0 3 kpa for 30 min to completely wet the aggregates ws a 5 g sample of aggregates soaked in ethanol for 10 min was placed in a flask containing 200 ml of deionized water and then shaken 20 times the mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min and then the water was removed by pipette these three samples from the above treatments were transferred to a 0 05 mm sieve soaked in alcohol and shaken 20 times the remaining sample of aggregates on the sieve was heated at 40 in an oven for 48 h and then passed through sieves with pore sizes of 2 mm 1 mm 0 5 mm 0 2 mm 0 1 mm and 0 05 mm to obtain their size distribution each treatment was repeated 3 times rees were extracted from all tagged soil and sediment samples using strong acid extraction in short they were adsorbed with soil particles and extracted repeatedly using hno3 68 by weight and hf 48 by weight and the concentration of extracted rees was detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry x series ⅱ icp ms thermo fisher scientific us detailed operations were reported by liu et al 2016 and each procedure was repeated twice 2 4 calculation the mass of eroded soil from the interrill area and rill area were calculated as follows 1 q 0 75 i 0 017 c l a y 0 0088 s a n d 0 02 r 2 0

the soil particle size distribution for calculation ki is determined by using the classic sedimentation method thus the conversion model developed by yang et al 2009 was employed to convert the measurement results of the laser diffraction method to sedimentation method 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were undertaken using spss 21 0 software spss inc chicago il usa one way analysis of variance one way anova followed by the least significant difference lsd test was used to compare the differences in runoff rate and soil aggregate stability among different soils pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between variables and influencing factors regression analysis was used to develop equations specifically the test data were randomly split into two groups one group n 30 was used to develop new equations and another group n 15 was used to evaluate and validate the newly developed equations the performance of the new equations was

sediment yield as shown in fig 1 the runoff rate increased with increasing rainfall intensity under given slope gradients the rainfall intensity increased from 60 mm h 1 to 120 mm h 1 and the runoff rates of the loamy clay clay loam silty clay loam sandy loam 1 and sandy loam 2 treatments increased by 102 30 85 14 128 48 196 37 and 148 14 respectively however the slope gradient had no significant effect on the runoff rate table 2 and a slightly decreasing tendency could be observed with increasing slope gradients overall the mean runoff rate of loamy clay clay loam and silty clay loam soils were obviously greater than those of sandy loam 1 and sandy loam 2 runoff generation is closely associated with soil texture table 2 indicates that the runoff rate was strongly positively related to rainfall intensity clay and silt p 0 01 and negatively related to sand p 0 01 while it was not strongly related to slope gradient p 0 05 therefore linear regression analysis was performed to explore the relationships among the runoff rate q and the main influential factors including rainfall intensity i clay and sand 19 q 0 75 i 0 017 c l a y 0 0088 s a n d 0 02 r 2 0 93 m e 0 92 the variations in interrill and rill erosion rates with rainfall duration under different experimental conditions are shown in fig 2 obvious rill erosion was found in all test conditions with the exception of 10 and 60 mm h 1 and its occurrence was advanced with increasing rainfall intensity the interrill erosion rate increased and then tended to be stable while the rill erosion rate gradually increased with the development of rills as a whole interrill erosion was the dominant erosion type and accounted for 80 of erosion the interrill erosion rate was in the following order silty clay loam clay loam loamy clay sandy loam 2 sandy loam 1 in addition as the slope gradient increased from 10 to 30 the average interrill erosion rates of loamy clay clay loam silty clay loam sandy loam 1 and sandy loam 2 increased by 1 63 1 79 1 27 1 73 and 2 23 times respectively these values increased by 2 91 3 01 3 26 9 12 and 5 98 times as the rainfall intensity increased from 60 mm h 1 to 120 mm h 1 respectively 3 2 soil aggregates and interrill erosion rate the mwdfw mwdsw and mwdws of the five soils varied from 0 097 to 0 43 mm from 0 39 to 2 65 mm and from 0 17 to 2 11 mm respectively table 3 significant differences among the mwdsw of the five soils and among the mwdfw and mwdws of the four soil textures were found loamy clay had the largest mwd values and sandy loam had the smallest mwd values this result indicated that the soil aggregates of loamy clay were the most stable and those of sandy loam were the least stable the mwd values for the same soil ranked from higher to lower as mwdsw mwdws mwdfw unlike the rsi the rmi and as were significantly different among the five soils and both showed the following order loamy clay clay loam silty clay loam sandy loam 1 sandy loam 2 mwdfw mwdsw and mwdws were positively correlated with clay p 0 01 as well as free from fe contents p 0 05 fig 3 they were negatively correlated with sand p 0 05 and weakly correlated with organic matter and other fe al hydr oxide contents p 0 05 rmi and as were significantly and negatively correlated with clay p 0 01 while rsi was positively correlated with clay p 0 079 the as is an integrated indicator considering the main mechanisms of aggregate breakdown based on randomly selected data n 30 in this study an improved equation was developed using as instead of ki as shown in eq 20 20 di 0 16 a s q i s f r 2 0 73 m e 0 71 3 3 hydraulic parameter characteristics and interrill erosion rate the variations in shear stress stream power and unit stream power for the five soils under different experimental conditions are shown in table 4 apparently the three hydraulic parameters increased with both rainfall intensity and slope gradient as the slope gradient increased from 10 to 30 the shear stress stream power and unit stream power increased by 110 73 150 11 and 249 33 on average respectively these parameters increased by 46 53 118 16 and 49 12 as the rainfall intensity increased from 60 mm h 1 to 120 mm h 1 respectively these findings indicated that hydraulic parameters were more sensitive to slope gradients than to rainfall intensity the relationships between the interrill erosion rate and the three hydraulic parameters are as follows fig 4 21 di 0 041 τ 0 018 r 2 0 34 m e 0 34 p 0 01 22 di 0 58 ω 0 0033 r 2 0 66 m e 0 66 p 0 01 23 di 1 23 p 0 026 r 2 0 27 m e 0 27 p 0 01 the three hydraulic parameters were highly correlated with the interrill erosion rate p 0 01 while r2 and me revealed the poor accuracy obtained with the use of a single hydraulic parameter for predicting the interrill erosion rate of five soils r2 0 8 me 0 7 different soils have different resistances to raindrop and sheet flow thus both soil and hydraulic parameters should be employed to model the interrill erosion rate additionally a general flow parameter can be derived from the flow velocity v flow depth h and hydraulic slope j li et al 2021b therefore multiple regression analysis was conducted on as v h and j and a new model of interrill erosion was obtained 24 di 142 79 a s 0 60 v 1 96 h 1 57 j 0 65 r 2 0 92 m e 0 92 3 4 evaluation and validation of the equation the ki calculated by eqs 12 and 13 was substituted into eq 11 to obtain the estimated values of the interrill erosion rate as shown in fig 5 a the values estimated by the wepp model were 2 01 times higher on average than the measured values of the interrill erosion rate me 0 also indicated that the estimated values greatly differed from the measured values the remaining data n 15 were used for model evaluation and validation fig 5b illustrates that eq 20 including as q i and sf greatly improve the prediction efficiency of the wepp model apparently r 2 reached 0 81 good r 2 0 80 revealing that di was highly correlated with as q i and sf and me reached 0 79 good me 0 70 revealing that the model was valid therefore eq 20 was capable of estimating the interrill erosion rate as shown in fig 5c the values estimated by eq 24 were very close to the measured values the statistical parameters r 2 0 90 me 0 89 rmse 0 016 ave 7 82 showed that the prediction efficiency of the interrill erosion rate was further improved when the model combined aggregate stability and hydraulic parameters 4 discussion 4 1 the factors controlling aggregate stability the mwd values of the five soils decreased in the sequence mwdsw mwdws mwdfw under the three treatments table 3 this indicated that slaking by rapid wetting was the main cause of the breakdown of aggregates followed by mechanical breakdown due to raindrop impact this finding was consistent with the reports of xiao et al 2017a and li et al 2021a who measured the aggregate stability of different soils using the same method generally soil clay and organic matter have the function of cementation which contribute to the formation of soil aggregates and increase aggregate stability six et al 2000 wuddivira et al 2009 xue et al 2019 however the aggregate stability had a positive correlation with clay but not with organic matter in this study fig 3 le bissonnais et al 2007 pointed out that aggregate stability was mainly controlled by clay when the organic matter content was lower than 15 g kg 1 the organic matter content of the tested soils was lower than the threshold except for silty clay loam resulting in the clay predominantly controlling the aggregate stability likewise the low fe al oxide content led to a weak correlation between fe al oxide and aggregate stability unexpectedly clay showed a significant negative correlation with rmi and as but a positive correlation with rsi this may be attributed to the increased inconsistency of mwdfw mwdws and mwdsw with increasing clay content xiao et al 2018 4 2 effect of soil aggregate stability on interrill erosion soil aggregate stability as an important indicator of soil structure has been considered to dominate the erosion process according to previous studies more stable soil aggregates are corresponded with a lower erosion rate yan et al 2008 xiao et al 2017b however loamy clay clay loam and silty clay loam with more stable aggregates had greater interrill erosion rates than sandy loam with less stable aggregates in the present study sun et al 2021 fang et al 2008 and chen et al 2013 found this same phenomenon in simulated rainfall experiment on different soils on the loess plateau of china this observation could be attributed to the difference in runoff rate of the tested soils chen et al 2013 interrill erosion is the result of the interaction between detachment by raindrops and transportation by sheet flow and the interrill erosion rate is determined by weaker processes kinnell 2005 xiao et al 2018 depending on the postulation of martinezmena et al 2002 a negative correlation between runoff rate and sediment concentration indicated a detachment limiting condition while the opposite signified a transport limiting condition fig 6 indicates that the transport limiting process was the dominant erosion mechanism in this study as positive correlations were found between sediment concentration and runoff rate therefore it could be deduced that the predetached soil particles by raindrops were deposited on the slope surface due to the inadequate transport capacity of sheet flow more runoff means greater transport capacity wang et al 2019 thus loamy clay clay loam and silty clay loam had greater interrill erosion rates than sandy loam soil aggregate stability plays a crucial role in interrill erosion under similar runoff rates for loamy clay clay loam and silty clay loam the average runoff rates were 1 20 1 25 and 1 11 mm min 1 respectively and no significant difference was found among them fig 1 therefore silty clay loam with the least stable aggregates among the three soils had the greatest interrill erosion rate similarly the interrill erosion rate of sandy loam 1 with less stable aggregates was greater than that of sandy loam 2 4 3 evaluation of the interrill erosion equation incorporating as the interrill erosion rate estimated by the wepp model was significantly different from the measured interrill erosion rate and similar findings were obtained by duiker et al 2001 ki is a comprehensive function of soil physicochemical properties and can vary within a standard texture romero et al 2007 however the calculation of ki ignored the influence of the soil structure especially the aggregate stability a study in semiarid areas also showed that the information on soil particle composition was inadequate to quantify ki vaezi et al 2018 this resulted in the poor efficiency in predicting the interrill erosion rate in the wepp model as is an integrated indicator considering the main mechanisms of aggregate breakdown which in turn is is an important process for raindrop detachment ma et al 2014 xiao et al 2018 therefore as could well characterize the process of raindrop detachment furthermore the higher efficiency of eq 20 than eq 11 for predicting the interrill erosion rate validates the hypothesis in this study in this study the shear stress stream power and unit stream power were used to estimate the interrill erosion rate this result was consistent with some earlier findings cao et al 2015 wang et al 2018 guo et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 our results also indicated that stream power was the optimal hydraulic parameter for estimating the interrill erosion rate unfortunately r 2 and me showed that the predicted efficiency of the three hydraulic parameters was unsatisfactory on the one hand this may be attributed to the difference in the optimal hydraulic parameters and conditions for quantifying interrill erosion rates of different soils li et al 2021b on the other hand water erosion is affected not only by flow but also by soil properties liu et al 2020 in this study eq 24 combined as and general flow intensity parameters to achieve satisfactory prediction efficiency with r 2 0 90 me 0 89 rmse 0 016 and ave 7 82 fig 5c as the basic hydrological parameters v h and j can well characterize the transport ability of sheet flow and h also plays an important role in rainfall splash kinnell 1991 gabet and dunne 2003 by incorporating as the eq 24 takes into account both the detachment and transport processes of interrill erosion and thus has better prediction efficiency than eq 20 it is noteworthy that eq 24 was established based on indoor tests and the tested soil structure was inevitably damaged during sampling and filling therefore it is necessary to validate the newly developed equation for undisturbed soil in the field for calibration 5 conclusions in this study the simulated rainfall and ree tracing methods were used to quantify the interrill erosion rate of five soils the results demonstrated that the interrill erosion rate of the tested soils increased both with rainfall intensity and slope gradient and the tested soils ranked in the following order in terms of interrill erosion rate silty clay loam clay loam loamy clay sandy loam 1 sandy loam 2 due to the difference in runoff rate loamy clay clay loam and silty clay loam with more stable aggregates had greater interrill erosion rates than sandy loam the equation including as q i and sf greatly improved the prediction accuracy of the interrill erosion compared to the wepp model the interrill erosion rate increased linearly with shear stress stream power and unit stream power however equations including single hydraulic parameters cannot achieve satisfactory prediction efficiency r 2 0 8 me 0 7 the newly developed equation combining as and the general flow intensity parameters could accurately estimate the interrill erosion rate with high r 2 0 90 and me 0 89 and low rmse 0 016 and ave 7 82 the equation indicated that the interrill erosion rate increased as as v h and j increased in power function and the exponents were 0 60 1 96 1 57 and 0 65 respectively this study showed that as is an appropriate indicator to characterize the susceptibility of soil to raindrop detachment however the runoff process should also be incorporated into interrill erosion prediction models these results are helpful for further understanding the mechanisms of interrill erosion and improving the prediction accuracy credit authorship

1781,water environment water resources carrying capacity wercc is a sustainability indicator rendering it significant to measure the water systems covering the water environment and water resources currently water environment carrying capacity wecc accounting and assessment mostly tend to the deterministic results of a single element under a design hydrological condition however the wercc as well as its components wecc and water resources carrying capacity wrcc is a random variable with a certain probability distribution to account for that we established a bayesian network based wercc overloading risk assessment method system it can calculate the water system carrying state and its corresponding probability after determining the wecc and wrcc probability distributions among them the probability distributions of the wecc and wrcc were determined by the bayesian formula and the spatiotemporal law respectively additionally based on the above quantitative uncertainty analysis in the basin a bayesian network based wercc overloading risk assessment path was built by modeling the causal chain of the wercc internal impact mechanism and the risk assessment results were obtained by the software netica taking the north canal basin in china as an example the results of wercc overloading risk zoning showed that cu6 and cu9 were severe risk areas cu2 cu7 cu8 and cu10 had moderate risks and the remaining 40 control units were slight or mild risks according to the overloading risk characteristics the uncertain quantitative assessment has provided a scientific basis for ensuring the sustainable development of the north canal from the perspective of reducing the water environment pressure wep and improving the wercc keywords water environment carrying capacity bayesian network water resources carrying capacity risk assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is one of the basic living substances of human society involving all aspects of human production and life the water environment is an important part of the natural environment system wang et al 2019a b currently global water security is facing increasing challenges maintaining water security and achieving the 2030 un water related goals for sustainable development have become a common vision for many countries in the world wang et al 2022 jia et al 2018 appreciated that the root cause of the water security challenge is rapid economic development and population growth ignoring the carrying capacity of water system water environment carrying capacity wecc indicates the total amount of pollutants that can be discharged into the water environment without changes in the functional structure of the water body wang et al 2019a b water resources carrying capacity wrcc refers to the ability of providing water resources to human social activities liao et al 2020 with the rapid socioeconomic development and continuous urban expansion in many asian countries human activities are exerting increasing pressure on the water systems in the basins bayu et al 2020 once the pressure e g pollutant inflow and total water use exceeds the wecc or wrcc of the basin it will lead to the deterioration of water quality water shortage and the degradation of water ecosystem functions seriously endangering the sustainable development of the basin water system wang et al 2019a b to ensure the sustainable development of the basin water system assessing the water system carrying status and identifying the causal factors of the wecc wrcc overloading in the basin have become a research hotspot robinson 1973 zhang et al 2019 water system wecc wrcc is a complex system involving numerous indicator factors wang et al 2019a b liao et al 2020 integrated both carriers and loads within regional water systems effectively capturing the interplay between the two components however the evaluation process of determining which standard level the indicators belonged to was uncertain when incorporating all the comparison results of every indicator into the carrying overloading status wang et al 2019a b wang and xu 2015 combined the variable fuzzy pattern recognition vfpr model and the analytic hierarchy process ahp to establish a new wecc indicator system the vfpr model can comprehensively consider the influence of different levels of relative membership on the results and retain more original information of the sample chen et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 used the principal component analysis pca for dynamic assessment of the temporal trends and explored a deep seated reason based on nature based solutions considering the water resources water environment carrying capacity wr wecc as the target jia et al 2018 constructed an evaluation system of wecc clustering and zoning indicators from four perspectives and the results indicated that 41 9 of the water environment in china was in need of priority protection nevertheless most of the current studies on wecc wrcc in the basin have adopted the single factor analysis under the design hydrological conditions or multi factor combination under deterministic conditions which could not reflect the complexity stochasticity and uncertainty of the internal elements of the water system water environment and water resources kang xu 2012 to address the uncertainty of wecc zeng and wang 1992 proposed a risk wecc stochastic estimation model but this method requires a relatively high amount of data afterward some scholars expanded uncertainty studies from the perspective of greyness and ambiguity of water systems using system dynamics sd hu et al 2021 cellular automaton ca zhou et al 2017 fuzzy vikor opricovic 2011 etc the cloud model could represent the randomness and fuzziness to assess the carrying grade of wrcc by realizing the conversion between uncertainty language and quantitative numerical expressions the uncertainty in the evaluation process was overcome to some extent peng et al 2021 li et al 2016 integrated stochastic interval linear and multiple objective programming to trace fuzzy information in industrial environment carrying systems however the fuzzy theory is only a semiquantitative and semiqualitative evaluation of a single indicator using fuzzy membership and cannot solve the stochastic uncertainty of each element magri berezowska azzag 2018 the artificial neural network ann algorithm can solve many nonlinear complex problems but it requires a very large training volume in practice and the results are highly uncertain ghiasi et al 2022 however most of the existing wecc uncertainty accounting is based on water environment quality models to obtain the numerical range without considering the prior probability distribution of model parameters and the wecc itself by all means the accounting results of the nonprobability distribution cannot be used as the basis of wecc wrcc risk assessment therefore to date there have been no uncertainty risk assessment studies for the combined wecc and wrcc carrying overloading states guided by risk analysis theory the use of probability distributions to quantitatively estimate uncertainty has been proven to be an effective tool for risk prevention and control which is more conducive to the development of management strategies wing et al 2022 the bayesian networks bns pearl 1986 are typical graphical models suitable for describing probabilistic causal relationships which can visually represent the interactions between elements in a system i e various risk factors marcot penman 2019 bns consist of directed acyclic graphs dags and conditional probability tables cpts which can integrate qualitative and quantitative knowledge from experts monitor data sets and compute models of experimental data landuyt et al 2014 therefore it is very suitable for solving problems with high diversity complexity and uncertainty lehikoinen 2014 bns are widely used in comprehensive water resources planning bromley et al 2005 social behavior investigation peng et al 2018 ecological risk assessment pollino et al 2007 and water quality simulation kingston et al 2005 castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 constructed a water system model that showed how to describe the relationships between subsystems and construct an integrated management model of the water environment and water resources taner et al 2019 proposed a bn approach to incorporate multidimensional probabilistic information into robustness based water systems planning indicating that the approach helps better distinguish the available options compared with the grey theory and the parametric system methods the water resource vulnerability assessment of the complex systems based on the bayesian theory could effectively address the uncertainty problem wang et al 2015 fienen et al 2013 explored the use of a bn to emulate a water flow model propagating uncertainty from inputs through to outputs this bn emulation was shown to capture the important flow characteristics and uncertainty of the water system in addition the bayesian method could compensate for the lack of prior knowledge in data processing and identify the corresponding relationship of parameters in the real time environment to accurately determine the water quality status and make effective emergency strategies rao et al 2021 the empirical curve fitting is impaired when samples do not represent the full complexity of the water system therefore vigiak and bende michl 2013 took advantage of the considerable parametric flexibility in bayesian inference to provide daily and monthly load estimates however few studies have considered the use of bns for quantitative uncertainty assessments of water environment water resources carrying state risks mishra et al 2018 to fill the gap in current research on the uncertainty overloading risk of the wecc wrcc we propose a bn based method system to quantify the ensemble of wecc and wrcc named water environment water resources carrying capacity wercc which includes the uncertainty accounting of wecc and wrcc the innovations of this study are as follows 1 bayesian theory is applied to the uncertainty accounting of wecc and wrcc and bayesian parameter estimation is used to modify the priori historical experience the combination of subjective judgment and objective monitoring provides a more comprehensive description of the carrying capacity of the water system 2 the combination of wercc theory computer programming and data science overcomes the singularity of traditional methods and obtains a more relevant uncertainty description of the actual water system 3 water quality and water quantity support and pressure are unified in bns modeling and various sources of information are utilized to assess responses of complex water systems to human activities this study makes two contributions which are 1 solving the problem to quantify the stochastic uncertainty of wecc wrcc and wep and constructing an uncertainty wercc accounting method based on bayesian probability and statistics 2 introducing the bn theory to analyze the causal chains of water systems and quantify their dependencies constructing a bn model for wercc overloading risk assessment and comprehensively analyzing the basin scale distributions of water environment and water resources overloading states this study takes the north canal basin as an example and proposes targeted management and regulation measures for different overloading risk areas the rest of this paper is structured as section 2 presents the main materials and methods of this study uncertainty analysis results of the wecc wrcc and wep based on section 2 3 1 and the bn based wercc overloading risk assessment and zoning according to section 2 3 2 are presented in section 3 discussions on the introduced method and demonstration results are presented in section 4 followed by the conclusion in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north canal 39 20 40 26 n 115 52 117 31 e is one of the rivers with the highest level of population industry and urbanization in the haihe river basin in china fig 1 its water pollution problem is also the most serious the mainstream passes through beijing hebei and tianjin in turn from the northwest and finally joins the haihe river in tianjin the total length is approximately 143 km and the basin area is 4348 km2 zhang et al 2021 the north canal basin is in a temperate continental monsoon climate zone with hot rainy summers and dry cold winters the average annual rainfall is approximately 643 mm with over 80 of the rainfall mainly falling between june and september according to statistics from the past 10 years the water flowing out of beijing accounts for 72 90 of the total water volume of the north canal the downstream rivers have very little natural runoff and rely on sewage treatment plant water and other types of sewage as their main sources of water therefore the north canal is essentially incapable of self purification the main pollution indicators are ammonia nitrogen nh3 n chemical oxygen demand cod and total phosphorus tp with nh3 n being the most prominent hou et al 2022 in 2017 the annual gross domestic product gdp of the basin was approximately 246 908 million with a population of 18 87 million an annual average runoff of 439 million cubic meters and an annual water volume of 893 million cubic meters in short the large dense packed population and the emphasis on economic development whatever the cost have led to the north canal being the basin with the highest water scarcity index zeng et al 2013 2 2 data sources most of the data in this study were obtained from

provided the non point pollution data which were obtained by the dpers diffuse pollution estimation with remote sensing non point source pollution assessment model the data such as water resources were from the previous research results of our group https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7696245 considering the data availability the time span of this study is from 2008 to 2017 in addition the parameters involved in the uncertainty analysis for wecc wrcc and wep are detailed in supporting information 2 3 methods in this study the basin wercc overloading risk assessment method system fig 2 includes qualitative analysis of the relevant elements of the water environment carrying system quantitative uncertainty accounting and analysis based on the bayesian formula and a bn based wercc overloading risk assessment model 2 3 1 uncertainty accounting of the wecc based on the bayesian formula 2 3 1 1 theoretical basis of bayesian statistical inference the bayesian statistical inference based on observed data estimates parameters and state variables through conditional posterior distributions the key difference from the frequentist framework is that the parameters are treated as random variables rather than fixed values kim and pearl 1983 pearl 1988 before any data can be obtained or any data can be fitted to a model the distribution that the parameters may obey needs to be determined assumed which is the prior distribution p θ the prior distribution contains uncertainty about the parameters the probability distribution of the available data d with a given parameter θ is often called the likelihood function p d θ indicating the extent to which the model parameters fit the measured data the posterior probability p θ d is the revised or updated probability after taking into consideration new information which is calculated by updating p θ using bayes theorem pearl 1986 1 p θ d p d θ p θ p d in contrast to the traditional deterministic wecc calculation see supporting information text s1 for detailed steps the basic steps of the uncertainty wecc accounting based on the bayesian formula are the same however the difference is that the parameters of the latter are random variables subject to a probability distribution rather than a certain value so it is necessary to determine the posterior distribution corresponding to each parameter 2 3 1 2 distribution of the comprehensive attenuation coefficient of pollutants it is a well known fact that the pollutants discharged into natural water bodies disappear slowly with time the removal of pollutants from a water body without any artificial controls is called self purification the mechanisms of self purification of water bodies can be divided into three groups physical processes chemical processes and biological processes comprehensive attenuation coefficient refers to the rate of pollutant degradation in the water body and its physical meaning is the daily or hourly percentage of pollutant degradation in the water body it is related to pollutant degradability water temperature and other hydrological conditions see text s1 in the supporting information for details the comprehensive attenuation coefficient k of the pollutants is calibrated according to the bayesian equation pearl 1986 2 p k d p d k p k p d where k is the comprehensive attenuation coefficient of pollutants which is a random variable p k d is the posterior distribution of parameter k that is the normalized result distribution of parameter k which represents the distribution pattern of model parameters after the observation data are obtained d is the sample information p k is the prior distribution function of the parameter k which mainly derives from the past observation data experience and subjective judgment p d k is the likelihood function which indicates the degree of goodness of fit of the model parameters to the measured data see text s5 3 in the supporting information for details since p d is a constant term the posterior probability of the parameter is proportional to the product of the likelihood function and the prior probability pearl 1988 3 p k d p d k p k a straight steady flowing non tributary confluent and non inlet discharge section of the river is used as the study object to determine the actual pollutant concentration data d and the water quality model the loss function is used to quantify the difference in the probability distribution between the model output and the observed results the squared error loss function is chosen to compare the difference between the calculated value l 2 and the actual value l 2 the likelihood function p d k of the observed samples for the parameter k is 4 p d k i 1 n 1 l 2 l 2 1 l 2 l 2 n where l 2 is the actual value of pollutant concentration at the end of the reach l 2 is the pollutant concentration at the same location calculated by the selected water quality model n denotes the number of a series of independent identically distributed data in d the parameter k is determined by minimization of the loss function in this study the p d k is not required to adhere to normalization constraints as its absolute value is of little importance the primary focus lies in the alterations to the p d k as the k varies a larger p d k signifies a more plausible choice for the k finally the product of the likelihood function and the prior probability is normalized to obtain the posterior probability p k d of the parameter k 2 3 1 3 distribution of other parameters 1 flow and flow rate the pearson type iii p iii curve is a widely used frequency curve line type in hydrological frequency calculations also known as the gamma distribution according to historical experience most hydrological parameters obey the p iii type distribution hu et al 2023 based on the monthly flow data of each hydrological station over the years the parameters of the p iii curve are estimated by the commonly used method of moments then the theoretical and empirical frequencies are compared based on the optimal line fitting method and the optimal parameters are selected finally the probability distribution of flow is determined the details can be found in the text s4 and text s5 1 after obtaining the estimated distribution of parameters for the flow the flow rate distribution and the flow distribution have the corresponding empirical relationship as follows 5 u a q b where u is the flow rate m s q is the flow m3 s a and b are hydraulic parameters i e empirical parameters determined from the measured data 2 background concentration and water quality target the determination of the background concentration distribution was based on the analysis of the actual monitored water quality data at the head of each reach data observation and data fitting analysis were performed using r project programming to determine the distributions the water quality target for each reach is the mathematical expectation value of the background water quality concentration in the corresponding reach text s5 2 and figure s2 in the supporting information for details 2 3 1 4 posterior distribution of wecc the wecc w is calculated based on the bayesian equation pearl 1988 6 p w d p d w p w first it is assumed that w belongs to a certain normal prior distribution p w with the standard deviation of σ then using the obtained parameter distributions random sampling is performed on each parameter for widely utilized distributions such as the gamma distribution the r language offers a convenient sampling function called rgamma to sample from the p k d the acceptance rejection sampling ars can be employed finally the calculated water quality value c at the end of the reach was compared with the water quality target concentration c s based on the se loss function to obtain the likelihood function p d w for the observed sample of w ma et al 2020 7 p d w i 1 n 1 2 π σ 2 e x p c i c s i 2 2 σ 2 the posterior distribution p w d of w can be calculated according to the equations 6 7 2 3 2 bn based structure and modeling for wercc overloading risk assessment a bn is a directed acyclic graph dag consisting of a set of random variables nodes and the dependencies between parent and child nodes are quantified by the cpts korb nicholson 2010 a bn is defined in terms of two components maldonado et al 2019 qualitative component in a graphical inference network each vertex represents a variable within the model and the presence of an edge e connecting two vertices signifies the existence of statistical dependence between the associated variables quantitative component for each variable x i i 1 v in the graph a conditional probability distribution p x i p a x i is determined where pa x i denotes the set of parent variables associated with x i the prior probability distributions associated with the parent nodes are denoted as the edge probability tables epts while the probability tables characterizing the dependencies between child nodes and their respective parent nodes are referred to as cpts in bns given the establishment of input variable probabilities and the assumption of conditional independence the joint probability distribution p x can be represented as the product of the conditional probabilities for each random variable ghahramani 2015 8 p x i 1 v p x i p a x i where the random variable node x x 1 x 2 x v is the set of all variable nodes in the bns the variable x i is conditionally independent from all non descendants given its parent nodes pa x i in bns each parent node p a x i has its prior probability distribution in different states while the causal relationship between the remaining nodes is determined by the conditional probability function the sum of the probability values of all nodes in cpts and epts at each state is 1 based on the characteristics of the dataset a bn with a reasonable structure and probability distribution was constructed by analyzing the existing dataset figure s11 bn modeling mainly consisted of two parts 1 defining the state values of nodes as discretized values conditions or criteria and 2 computing the cpts 2 3 2 1 overloading risk assessment mechanism for the wecc overloading risk cod nh3 n and tp could be selected as indicators for consideration the overloading of the wecc in the basin could be assessed by analyzing the wecc and the number of pollutants entering the river for the wrcc overloading risk what must be considered was whether the available water resources in the water systems could meet the water demand for human production and life 2 3 2 2 relevant variable selection and processing in the bn model each node corresponds to a different variable when fewer variables are selected the accuracy of the evaluation results will be low in contrast it is easy to absorb some noise variables thus affecting the soundness of the bn construction the efficiency of the model operation and the accuracy of the evaluation another consideration is the availability quantification degree and relevance of variable related data in the actual modeling process for complex environmental systems that lack data expert knowledge is an important source of information that can provide experience for quantitative simulation and prediction in the system in the bn model of comprehensive wecc overloading risk assessment nodes variables could be divided into three types 1 indicator layer risk factors root nodes the root nodes are usually the quantitative variables for these risk factors including the environmental carrying capacity of pollutants the number of pollutants entering the river the availability of water resources and the total water consumption 2 middle layer elements intermediate nodes the intermediate nodes facilitate a more reasonable quantitative evaluation of the target layer including the single factor carrying capacity overloading risk nodes cod carrying capacity overloading risk nh3 n carrying capacity overloading risk tp carrying capacity overloading risk wrcc overloading risk and multi factor overloading risk nodes wecc overloading risk 3 evaluation target layer target node different from the first two types of nodes there is usually only one target node that is the purpose of the comprehensive evaluation of the system the target node can be set as wercc overloading risk the relevant variable processing includes missing value processing singular value removal variable distribution pattern analysis data discretization processing and so on in the actual modeling process continuous variables are usually discretized because bns based on discrete variables are more efficient in construction and operation in addition the variables of the intermediate and target nodes need to determine their dependencies on the child nodes that is the corresponding cpts should be given 2 3 2 3 determine the network structure the key to constructing a bn structure is to study the influence processes of each overloading risk i e their causal relationships and the interrelationships between different processes and then comprehensively analyze and visualize all causal chains first starting with the risk factors each random variable in section 2 3 2 2 is plotted as a node in the network structure second the topology of the bayesian network figure s11 is constructed based on the framework of the wercc overloading risk assessment method system in the basin fig 2 and the root node intermediate node target node risk transfer mechanism after that the cpts need to be adjusted to quantify the causal relationship by combining expert experience and linear interpolation method ban et al 2014 the extreme cases are first set to 0 or 100 risk experts and local stakeholders including government managers enterprise leaders and local residents are then invited to complete the probability tables for the combinations of variables finally the interpolation factors are calculated by nemerow index text s3 and the conditional probabilities for the remaining states are interpolated in some cases the network structure may not be static and will be modified and adjusted based on the model evaluation results and actual needs 3 results 3 1 uncertainty calculation of the wecc based on the bayesian formula according to the deterministic wecc results of each reach at different guarantee rates see table s1 table s3 in the supporting information for details the normal prior distribution p w of the wecc of each calculation unit was set accordingly using the obtained distributions for each parameter see text s5 and figures s1 s5 in the supporting information for details random sampling was performed for each parameter according to the square error loss function the water quality c at the end of the reach was compared with the target water quality concentration c s and the likelihood function p d w of the observed samples with the parameter w was obtained according to the product of the likelihood function and the prior probability the posterior distribution p w d of w was obtained 3 1 1 wecc of cod the probability density distributions of the cod wecc in the north canal basin are shown in fig 3 a except for cu5 which was left skewed all of the other reaches were right skewed compared with the standard normal distribution with the kurtosis of 3 the kurtosis of each distribution was less than 3 which belonged to the thin tailed distribution the parameters of the uncertainty cod wecc accounting results are shown in table 1 the main flow control units cu1 cu2 cu3 cu4 and cu5 of the north canal were characterized by higher pollutant concentrations higher flows and larger weccs with the expected weccs mostly above 10 000 t a the maximum expected value of the wecc for mainstream in the whole area was cu2 45 600 t a and the minimum expected value was cu5 6881 5 t a except for cu7 with high flow and cu8 with high flow and long reaches the wecc of each tributary control unit was relatively small at 10 800 t a and 21 500 t a respectively cu6 had the smallest expected wecc 782 1 t a fig 4 a shows the position of the deterministic cod wecc values see table s1 on the cumulative probability distribution diagram the deterministic wecc with different guarantee rates basically followed the trend of the probability distribution of the uncertain wecc 3 1 2 wecc of nh3 n fig 3b shows the probability density distribution of the nh3 n wecc in the north canal basin from the nh3 n wecc distribution of each control unit the two control units cu4 and cu7 were left skewed and the rest of the reaches were right skewed all distributions were thin tailed the parameters of the uncertain nh3 n wecc accounting results are shown in table 2 the distribution pattern of the nh3 n wecc was similar to that of cod the expected values of wecc for all five control units in the mainstream were above 100 t a the maximum expected value of the wecc in the mainstream of the whole region was cu2 1880 04 t a and the minimum expected value was cu5 108 35 t a the tributary control units had relatively small weccs only cu7 and cu8 with 440 46 t a and 643 81 t a respectively cu6 had the smallest expected wecc 18 44 t a fig 4b shows the cumulative probability distribution of the nh3 n wecc and its corresponding relationship with the deterministic wecc see table s2 the deterministic wecc under different guarantee rates basically conformed to the trend of the probability distribution of the uncertain wecc the prior information based on the actual monitoring data was adjusted and modified by the bayesian method 3 1 3 wecc of tp the probability density distribution of the tp wecc is shown in fig 3c from the tp wecc distribution of each control unit the four control units on cu4 cu5 cu7 and cu8 were left skewed and the rest of the rivers were right skewed all of which belong to a thin tailed distribution the parameters of the uncertainty tp wecc accounting results are shown in table 3 the distribution pattern of the tp wecc was similar to that of the nh3 n and cod weccs most of the weccs expected values for the five control units in the mainstream of the north canal were above 100 t a the maximum expected value of the wecc in the mainstream of the whole basin was cu2 457 84 t a and the minimum expected value was cu5 69 08 t a the tributary control units had relatively small weccs only cu7 and cu8 with 111 13 t a and 216 37 t a respectively cu6 had the smallest expected wecc 7 51 t a fig 4c shows the cumulative probability distribution of the tp wecc and its corresponding relationship with the deterministic wecc see table s3 although the trend of the probability distribution of the deterministic wecc remained more or less the same as that of the uncertain wecc for different guarantee rates it could be seen that the prior information of some control units e g cu9 was more corrected 3 2 uncertainty analysis of wrcc and wep based on probability statistics 3 2 1 probability distribution of the wrcc the wrcc considering the water quantity dimension refers to the ability of water bodies to supply water resources to humans for specific wrcc issues the wrcc was usually expressed in terms of the number of available water resources li et al 2019 the analysis methods of water availability are detailed in the supporting information text s1 the monthly data of surface water resources swrs available and groundwater resources grs available were summed to obtain the monthly data of the total available water resources and their distribution was further analyzed to obtain the probability distribution of water availability as shown in figure s6 the available water resources in the north canal basin obeyed a skewed distribution cu5 and cu8 had the most abundant available water resources the available water resources at cu8 had the highest probability density at approximately 21 million t m while cu5 was at approximately 17 million t m cu10 had a relatively small amount of available water resources with the highest probability density of less than 1 million t m control units with relatively scarce available water resources included cu6 and cu9 3 2 2 probability distribution of wep 3 2 2 1 cod inflow figure s7 shows the probability density distribution of cod inflow for each control unit in the north canal basin and the expected values of point and nonpoint source inflows are shown in table s4 the total cod inflow per control unit did not vary much and the expected value of the total inflow was approximately 10 000 t a however the cod inflow varied considerably among the control units among them the cod inflows in cu2 cu7 and cu8 were relatively large at 35435 81 t a 24580 32 t a and 13038 92 t a respectively however cu4 and cu6 had the smallest total inflows of less than 500 t a in the control units with large cod inflows the proportion of point source pollution was as high as 98 control units with relatively small cod inflows accounted for a relatively high proportion of cod nonpoint source pollution cu6 accounted for 63 2 and cu4 accounted for 75 6 3 2 2 2 nh3 n inflow figure s8 shows the probability density distribution of nh3 n inflow for each control unit in the north canal basin and the expected values of point and nonpoint source inflows are shown in table s5 the variation of the total nh3 n inflow for each control unit was also small and the expected value of the total inflow was approximately 500 t a however the nh3 n inflow varied greatly among the control units among them cu1 cu2 cu7 and cu8 had relatively large nh3 n inflows 1970 95 t a 725 85 t a 665 36 t a and 421 83 t a respectively however the total inflows of cu4 cu5 and cu6 were the smallest less than 50 t a in the control units with large nh3 n inflows the proportion of point source pollution was up to 90 or more the proportion of nh3 n nonpoint source pollution was relatively high in the control units with relatively small nh3 n inflows cu6 accounted for 94 3 and cu4 accounted for 89 6 3 2 2 3 tp inflow figure s9 shows the probability density distribution of tp inflow for each control unit in the north canal basin and the expected values of point and nonpoint source inflows are shown in table s6 the variation in the total tp inflow for each control unit was also small with an expected value of the total inflow being approximately 100 t a however the tp inflow varied greatly among the control units among them cu1 and cu2 had relatively large tp inflows 345 19 t a 241 04 t a and 137 56 t a respectively however the total inflows of cu4 cu5 and cu9 were the smallest less than 10 t a the percentage of point source pollution was as high as 97 in the control units with large tp inflows control units with relatively small tp inflows accounted for a relatively high proportion of tp nonpoint source pollution the point source pollution was almost zero for cu5 while the nonpoint source pollution accounted for 93 for cu4 3 2 2 4 total water use water resources in the basin are divided into three main parts namely agricultural water domestic water and industrial water in general agriculture in the beijing tianjin hebei region has been dominated by aquaculture li et al 2019 in this study the annual data of the total water use in each control unit were distributed as monthly data and their probability distributions were further analyzed the probability density distribution of total water use in the north canal basin is shown in figure s10 the control units in the middle reach cu2 cu7 and cu8 consumed the largest amount of water mainly due to the large population and high level of urbanization in this area and the domestic water consumption was much higher than that in other areas this is followed by the control units in the upper reaches such as cu6 where most of the upper reaches were mountainous with low population density and high agricultural water consumption the control units in the middle and lower reaches of the basin such as cu4 and cu9 had large cultivation areas and a high volume of livestock and poultry breeding the primary industry was relatively developed and the agricultural water consumption was relatively large 3 3 bn based wercc overloading risk assessment and zoning 3 3 1 identify network nodes table 4 and table 5 represent the overloading risk module nodes for the wecc and wrcc respectively table s7 shows the water environment carrying rates and the corresponding overloading states the nemerow index was introduced in the multifactor carrying capacity overloading risk calculation which considered the average and maximum values of the single factor carrying capacity overloading risk and highlighted the influence and effect of the most severe overloading factor the calculation equations can be found in the supporting information text s3 3 3 2 bn structure and running results figure s11 shows the bn structure of the wercc overloading risk in the basin the target node wercc overloading risk was represented by a rectangle and there were also 8 root nodes and 5 intermediate nodes represented by ellipses the two child nodes of the target node were wecc overloading risk and wrcc overloading risk which measured the water quality and quantity respectively table 6 shows the cpt of the wercc overloading risk the wercc overloading risks for cu6 in the upper reaches fig 5 cu2 in the middle reaches fig 6 and cu5 in the lowest reaches fig 7 were taken as examples to analyze the model running results the results of the other control units performances are shown in figure s12 s18 of the supporting information 3 3 2 1 take cu6 as an example the overall risk probabilities of cu6 being at r1 r2 r3 and r4 were 0 18 5 79 30 1 and 64 0 respectively the probability of severe overloading was the highest followed by the probability of moderate overloading and mild overloading the wercc in this unit was overloaded seriously in terms of the risk of wecc overloading there was a 53 6 probability of moderate overloading conditions and a 43 0 probability of severe overloading conditions in terms of the risk of wrcc overloading the unit had a relatively developed primary industry with high agricultural and residential water use however due to the low flow in the upper reaches of the basin the available water resources were insufficient therefore there was a 66 6 probability that the wrcc overloading condition was considered a severe risk 3 3 2 2 take cu2 as an example the overall risk of cu2 was at 2 16 15 6 39 6 and 42 7 probability of being at r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively the probability of being in severe and moderate overloading was the highest and the probability of not overloading was very low at 2 16 in general the wercc overloading of cu2 was not promising since cu2 was located in the middle reaches of the basin covering part of central beijing more point source pollution put some pressure on the water supply system for the wecc overloading risk submodule the cod carrying capacity overloading risk was the most serious and almost distributed in a moderate overloading state the nh3 n carrying capacity overloading risk was basically in a slight overloading state the tp was in good carrying condition and there was no overloading risk at all therefore the wecc was most likely to be in a slight and moderate overloading state for the wrcc overloading risk submodule the severe overloading accounted for 64 9 mainly because the urban domestic water consumption was large and the water system was prone to a water supply shortage resulting in water resources overloading 3 3 2 3 take cu5 as an example the probabilities that the wercc overloading risk of cu5 was at r1 r2 r3 and r4 were 87 9 5 61 5 27 and 1 17 respectively indicating a relatively positive overall situation the two submodules wecc and wrcc also had a nonoverloaded carrying capacity status with a high probability cu5 covering the most downstream area of the mainstream also had the largest flow and its ability to digest pollutants was strong so the water quality was better than that of the other cus both the cod and tp carrying capacity overloading risks were nonoverloaded with a probability of 100 and the nh3 n carrying capacity overloading risk was nonoverloaded with a probability of 99 4 for the wrcc overloading risk this control unit had fewer industrial production activities more agricultural water demand and more water resources in the downstream of the basin therefore the wrcc was not overloaded with a probability of 87 4 but there would still be the possibility of overloading or even severe overloading 3 3 3 overloading risk zoning in the north canal basin the four overloading states r1 r2 r3 and r4 were assigned to 1 2 3 and 4 respectively and the corresponding overloading risk indexes of the target units were determined using equation s9 see supporting information based on the results of the wercc overloading risk assessment for the north canal figs 5 7 and figure s12 s18 different overloading risk zones were obtained table s9 accordingly the north canal control units were divided into four types of areas slight overloading risk area r r i s k i n d e x 1 00 1 25 mild overloading risk area r r i s k i n d e x 1 25 2 25 moderate overloading risk area r r i s k i n d e x 2 25 3 25 and severe overloading risk area r r i s k i n d e x 3 25 4 00 figure s19 shows the distribution of the wercc overloading risk in the north canal among them cu3 and cu5 were slight overloading risk areas cu1 and cu4 were mild overloading risk areas cu6 and cu9 were severe overloading risk areas the remaining control units were moderate overloading risk areas 4 discussion 4 1 about the study case climate change and anthropogenic activities jointly impact the carrying capacity of water systems variations in meteorological parameters such as temperature and precipitation induce alterations in the water cycle processes within a basin substantially increasing the likelihood of extreme hydrological events including floods and droughts yin et al 2021 yin et al 2023 human activities can modify land use patterns and vegetation cover as well as generate point and nonpoint source pollution the implementation of water management infrastructure can induce static water flows sedimentation of particulate matter transported from upstream sources and a decline in the self purification capacity of water bodies collectively these factors contribute to a diminished wecc barnett et al 2005 wang et al 2019a b as illustrated in fig 3 the control unit exhibits an increased wecc in correspondence with longer channels and higher river flows this occurs as extended periods of low flows or droughts can lead to increased retention time for pollutants within the water system yin et al 2023 for example cu2 with the largest expected value of the wecc has the longest river with a length of 45 10 km into which many tributaries converge in contrast rivers with low flows and short lengths have smaller wecc values for example cu6 which has the smallest expected wecc value has a length of 10 23 km and small flows concentrated below 3 m3 s in comparison although cu3 has a shorter river length of approximately 8 92 km the flows are relatively large concentrated in the range of 20 m3 s 30 m3 s and its wecc is also relatively large the background concentration exerts an influence on the distribution of the wecc however the disparities in background concentration distributions across various river reaches are relatively subtle chen et al 2010 conducted a thorough analysis demonstrating that within the wecc influence factor the design flow was identified as the most sensitive input parameter followed by the comprehensive attenuation coefficient in terms of the influencing factors of the wecc the wecc in the study area is mainly affected by the flow and the length of the river segment followed by the background concentration and the water quality target concentration which is similar to the study results of stow and borsuk 2003 compared with the traditional design conditions of deterministic wecc accounting zhang et al 2015 the uncertain wecc accounting based on the bayesian theory not only reflects the information contained in the former and uses prior knowledge to ensure the reasonableness and accuracy of the results stow et al 2007 it is a relatively new and intuitive probability distribution of the wecc which is conducive to the refined management of the water environment in the basin the method has a certain degree of universality and is equally applicable to other study areas and other pollutant indicators alameddine et al 2011 as shown in figure s7 figure s9 spatially the control units with higher cod nh3 n and tp inflows are mostly located in the middle reaches of the basin and the inflows are mostly from point source pollution while the control units with lower cod nh3 n and tp inflows are mostly from the upper or lower reaches of the basin with a higher proportion of nonpoint source pollution this might be because there are more large scale centralized treatment facilities in the middle reaches of the basin with higher sewage treatment capacity and wastewater treatment volume and high point source discharges the upper reaches areas such as cu6 are mostly located in mountainous areas with more rural domestic sewage discharges the lower reaches of the basin have a relatively high proportion of the primary industries the high application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers and large scale livestock breeding have caused serious related pollution as a result rural domestic nonpoint source pollution agricultural cultivation source pollution and livestock breeding source pollution are all higher in the lower reach areas when compared to the middle and upper reaches resulting in a relatively high proportion of nonpoint source pollution in the upper and lower reaches of the basin wang et al 2019a b the inadequate ecological recharge downstream is another contributing factor to the suboptimal water quality global climate change is exerting a significant influence on regional precipitation trends leading to their continual evolution the heightened spatial heterogeneity of precipitation patterns and an increase in the heterogeneity of water resource distribution within the basin yin et al 2021 regarding spatial distribution the mean annual precipitation amounts to 582 mm in the middle reaches of the north canal basin while approximately 565 mm is observed in middle and lower reaches notably annual precipitation exhibits its nadir in both the upper and lower reaches to a certain degree precipitation functions as a source of clean water with increased precipitation levels positively correlating to larger wecc wang et al 2019a b nevertheless it generates surface runoff potentially leading to nonpoint source pollution yin et al 2022a b moreover it has been demonstrated that a confluence of factors including precipitation patterns topographic features vegetative coverage and soil composition collectively exert an impact on nonpoint source pollution alvarez cobelas et al 2008 unlike the uncertainty analysis based on the bayesian theory the data fitting analysis on the basis of r project can study the unknown distribution in the absence of prior distribution this is undoubtedly a more comprehensive and accurate description of the random variables and lays the foundation for the wercc overloading risk assessment borsuk et al 2002 1 slight overloading risk area including cu3 and cu5 these two control units are in good water environment condition with a low risk of overloading and little need for special measures particularly in terms of water quality this is because they are in the middle and lower reaches of the basin where flows and corresponding weccs are high and the pollution loads are relatively low zhang et al 2018 however in terms of water use cu5 still has a certain potential for water overloading nearly 10 mainly due to the high demand for water for agriculture caused by its developed level of agriculture therefore in terms of water resource utilization relevant measures can be taken to prevent water shortages from occurring given its water use situation the main considerations are to improve water use efficiency accelerate the construction of efficient water saving agriculture strengthen rain fed agriculture and adjust the water use structure qi et al 2021 in addition it is also possible to increase the utilization rate of recycled water strengthen the construction of water storage and water saving facilities and improve the efficiency of agricultural irrigation from an economic point of view the popularization of rational water use and water conservation can be promoted through for example the imposition of a water tax 2 mild overloading risk area including cu1 and cu4 these two control units have essentially no wecc overloading mainly because their weccs are relatively large and have a better capacity to absorb pollutants however the environment carrying state of water resources is not ideal with these two control units having nearly half the probability of wrcc overloading mainly due to the large scale of agricultural production and high agricultural water consumption cu1 is relatively scarce in terms of water supply there is a need to strengthen the construction of water storage water saving reuse and water saving facilities especially agricultural water conservation and rational water distribution regional water transfers can also be considered to solve the water supply problem chung et al 2021 cu4 in the lower reaches needs attention to rational water allocation and policies related to strengthening efficient water use in agriculture garcia et al 2016 3 moderate overloading risk area including the control units of cu2 cu7 cu8 and cu10 these three control units cu2 cu7 and cu8 are located in the middle reaches of the north canal basin they are also the three units covering the central city of beijing they all have developed regional economies with a high proportion of the tertiary industries and high population densities the pollution is relatively high and the demand for domestic water is large wu et al 2020 the water pollution comes mainly from point sources which are concentrated in urban domestic sewage and sewage treatment plant discharges there is a high proportion of urban domestic water use there is a need to reduce the direct discharge of domestic sewage strengthen the prevention and control of water pollution and improve the capacity and efficiency of sewage treatment zhang et al 2021 in addition a leading group for comprehensive water pollution control could be established to strengthen law enforcement and supervision and strictly control the total amount of pollutants discharged for the water resources problem in the city water prices should be reasonably adjusted regional water transfer should be implemented and the concept of water conservation be strengthened gonzales and ajami 2017 cu10 is located in the lower part of the basin this area is dominated by primary industries the pollution comes mainly from emissions from agricultural cultivation sources and livestock breeding sources the agricultural water consumption is also high it could strengthen the construction of organic fertilizer plants the treatment of pollutants such as livestock and poultry manure and the ecological restoration of agricultural drainage ditches 4 severe overloading risk area including cu6 and cu9 wu et al 2020 suggested that the water quality in the upper and lower reaches of the north canal was generally better than that in the middle reaches however the superiority of water quality is not fully equivalent to the level of wercc overloading risk cu6 is located in the upper reaches of the basin and has a smaller wecc and fewer available water resources the large proportion of the primary industries leads to a high level of agricultural and domestic nonpoint source pollution cu9 is located in the middle and lower reaches of the basin and the situation is similar to that of cu6 that is the water consumption for agriculture and domestic purposes is relatively high for water quality problems the equipment could be optimized by improving the scale and the treatment capacity of sewage treatment plants rationalizing the design of recycled water reuse pathways and improving the efficiency of agricultural fertilizers application for water resources problems the use of reclaimed water and sewage could be increased by transferring water from outside the region increasing the penetration of water saving appliances in rural areas and placing emphasis on the development and application of recycled water reuse technology 4 2 about limitations and perspectives 1 the uncertainty analysis involved in this study is a process of data analysis based on probability statistics and computer programming and the quality and the quantity of data are crucial some of the data in this study need to be further improved e g the number of monitoring sections and point sources in the future studies with the intelligence and refinement of data storage the environmental data sources will be correspondingly more comprehensive and accurate thus laying a solid foundation for a more reasonable data analysis 2 the basin wercc overloading risk assessment methodological system proposed in this study mainly considers the water environment subsystem and water resources subsystem but not the water ecology subsystem this is because the water ecology subsystem involves factors and indicators that are difficult to quantify e g the damage to water ecology caused by human activities however water quality and water quantity can also reflect the water ecology health to a large extent to further improve the methodological system it should be considered to integrate the water ecology factors and analyze them qualitatively and quantitatively 3 although the corresponding relationships across cus and between upstream and downstream of river sections were considered during the wecc modeling and data preparation stages soil and water assessment tool production and sink model hydrological model etc the spatial dependence between cus was not considered in the process of constructing the basin wercc overloading risk assessment framework in the future researches a bayesian network model can be developed across cus at the whole basin scale 4 a noted limitation of the bn modeling approach has been its difficulty in considering spatial dynamics within a system when the system is dynamical e g water system bn can only be applied when the time horizon is not too long castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 static bns cannot capture the spatial feedback mechanisms within the system due to their acyclic framework morrison and stone 2014 future optimizations will be made in terms of a exploring the relationship between the number of model samples indicator state changes and model output results to obtain the most significant impact factors b introducing more impact factors e g ecological variables to generate different cpts and analyzing the impact mechanisms of overloading risk events that have occurred c coupling the hydrodynamic models e g mike21 and bn modeling framework to explicitly account for effects of dynamic changes on wercc overloading evaluation 5 the proposed wercc overloading risk assessment framework in this study has a generic nature and can be applied at a larger watershed regional scale however it is insufficient to solely consider human activities as future climate stress is expected to worsen water scarcity and exert pressure on water systems li and sivapalan 2020 with climate warming the intensity of precipitation increases exponentially leading to exacerbated flood conditions yin et al 2021 yin et al 2022a b additionally numerous studies have demonstrated that compound drought heat wave events have become significant climate stressors for global sustainability yin et al 2023 these climate changes have amplified the adverse impacts on water system sustainability and human well being given the increasing frequency of compound climate risks future research should focus on better preparing adaptation and mitigation solutions yin et al 2022a b 5 conclusions in this study the uncertainty accounting method of the wercc in the basin including the wecc and wrcc is discussed according to the connotation of the wercc and the corresponding uncertainty wep is considered a risk assessment generic model framework for wercc overloading based on bns in the basin has been developed taking the north canal basin as an example the areas at risk of moderate to severe overloading for wercc are concentrated in the middle and upper reaches mainly in economically developed areas such as the central urban areas of beijing and the more agriculturally developed upper and middle reaches fringe areas densely populated economically developed areas have high water pressure and serious water pollution however in the more agriculturally developed areas agricultural water consumption is large and pollutant emissions from agricultural cultivation sources and pollution from livestock and poultry sources are more serious overall this study is of particular importance for the scientific understanding of the contradictions between the water system and human society and for the coordinated and sustainable development of the water environment and water resources in the basin region 6 open research 6 1 data

1781,water environment water resources carrying capacity wercc is a sustainability indicator rendering it significant to measure the water systems covering the water environment and water resources currently water environment carrying capacity wecc accounting and assessment mostly tend to the deterministic results of a single element under a design hydrological condition however the wercc as well as its components wecc and water resources carrying capacity wrcc is a random variable with a certain probability distribution to account for that we established a bayesian network based wercc overloading risk assessment method system it can calculate the water system carrying state and its corresponding probability after determining the wecc and wrcc probability distributions among them the probability distributions of the wecc and wrcc were determined by the bayesian formula and the spatiotemporal law respectively additionally based on the above quantitative uncertainty analysis in the basin a bayesian network based wercc overloading risk assessment path was built by modeling the causal chain of the wercc internal impact mechanism and the risk assessment results were obtained by the software netica taking the north canal basin in china as an example the results of wercc overloading risk zoning showed that cu6 and cu9 were severe risk areas cu2 cu7 cu8 and cu10 had moderate risks and the remaining 40 control units were slight or mild risks according to the overloading risk characteristics the uncertain quantitative assessment has provided a scientific basis for ensuring the sustainable development of the north canal from the perspective of reducing the water environment pressure wep and improving the wercc keywords water environment carrying capacity bayesian network water resources carrying capacity risk assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is one of the basic living substances of human society involving all aspects of human production and life the water environment is an important part of the natural environment system wang et al 2019a b currently global water security is facing increasing challenges maintaining water security and achieving the 2030 un water related goals for sustainable development have become a common vision for many countries in the world wang et al 2022 jia et al 2018 appreciated that the root cause of the water security challenge is rapid economic development and population growth ignoring the carrying capacity of water system water environment carrying capacity wecc indicates the total amount of pollutants that can be discharged into the water environment without changes in the functional structure of the water body wang et al 2019a b water resources carrying capacity wrcc refers to the ability of providing water resources to human social activities liao et al 2020 with the rapid socioeconomic development and continuous urban expansion in many asian countries human activities are exerting increasing pressure on the water systems in the basins bayu et al 2020 once the pressure e g pollutant inflow and total water use exceeds the wecc or wrcc of the basin it will lead to the deterioration of water quality water shortage and the degradation of water ecosystem functions seriously endangering the sustainable development of the basin water system wang et al 2019a b to ensure the sustainable development of the basin water system assessing the water system carrying status and identifying the causal factors of the wecc wrcc overloading in the basin have become a research hotspot robinson 1973 zhang et al 2019 water system wecc wrcc is a complex system involving numerous indicator factors wang et al 2019a b liao et al 2020 integrated both carriers and loads within regional water systems effectively capturing the interplay between the two components however the evaluation process of determining which standard level the indicators belonged to was uncertain when incorporating all the comparison results of every indicator into the carrying overloading status wang et al 2019a b wang and xu 2015 combined the variable fuzzy pattern recognition vfpr model and the analytic hierarchy process ahp to establish a new wecc indicator system the vfpr model can comprehensively consider the influence of different levels of relative membership on the results and retain more original information of the sample chen et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 used the principal component analysis pca for dynamic assessment of the temporal trends and explored a deep seated reason based on nature based solutions considering the water resources water environment carrying capacity wr wecc as the target jia et al 2018 constructed an evaluation system of wecc clustering and zoning indicators from four perspectives and the results indicated that 41 9 of the water environment in china was in need of priority protection nevertheless most of the current studies on wecc wrcc in the basin have adopted the single factor analysis under the design hydrological conditions or multi factor combination under deterministic conditions which could not reflect the complexity stochasticity and uncertainty of the internal elements of the water system water environment and water resources kang xu 2012 to address the uncertainty of wecc zeng and wang 1992 proposed a risk wecc stochastic estimation model but this method requires a relatively high amount of data afterward some scholars expanded uncertainty studies from the perspective of greyness and ambiguity of water systems using system dynamics sd hu et al 2021 cellular automaton ca zhou et al 2017 fuzzy vikor opricovic 2011 etc the cloud model could represent the randomness and fuzziness to assess the carrying grade of wrcc by realizing the conversion between uncertainty language and quantitative numerical expressions the uncertainty in the evaluation process was overcome to some extent peng et al 2021 li et al 2016 integrated stochastic interval linear and multiple objective programming to trace fuzzy information in industrial environment carrying systems however the fuzzy theory is only a semiquantitative and semiqualitative evaluation of a single indicator using fuzzy membership and cannot solve the stochastic uncertainty of each element magri berezowska azzag 2018 the artificial neural network ann algorithm can solve many nonlinear complex problems but it requires a very large training volume in practice and the results are highly uncertain ghiasi et al 2022 however most of the existing wecc uncertainty accounting is based on water environment quality models to obtain the numerical range without considering the prior probability distribution of model parameters and the wecc itself by all means the accounting results of the nonprobability distribution cannot be used as the basis of wecc wrcc risk assessment therefore to date there have been no uncertainty risk assessment studies for the combined wecc and wrcc carrying overloading states guided by risk analysis theory the use of probability distributions to quantitatively estimate uncertainty has been proven to be an effective tool for risk prevention and control which is more conducive to the development of management strategies wing et al 2022 the bayesian networks bns pearl 1986 are typical graphical models suitable for describing probabilistic causal relationships which can visually represent the interactions between elements in a system i e various risk factors marcot penman 2019 bns consist of directed acyclic graphs dags and conditional probability tables cpts which can integrate qualitative and quantitative knowledge from experts monitor data sets and compute models of experimental data landuyt et al 2014 therefore it is very suitable for solving problems with high diversity complexity and uncertainty lehikoinen 2014 bns are widely used in comprehensive water resources planning bromley et al 2005 social behavior investigation peng et al 2018 ecological risk assessment pollino et al 2007 and water quality simulation kingston et al 2005 castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 constructed a water system model that showed how to describe the relationships between subsystems and construct an integrated management model of the water environment and water resources taner et al 2019 proposed a bn approach to incorporate multidimensional probabilistic information into robustness based water systems planning indicating that the approach helps better distinguish the available options compared with the grey theory and the parametric system methods the water resource vulnerability assessment of the complex systems based on the bayesian theory could effectively address the uncertainty problem wang et al 2015 fienen et al 2013 explored the use of a bn to emulate a water flow model propagating uncertainty from inputs through to outputs this bn emulation was shown to capture the important flow characteristics and uncertainty of the water system in addition the bayesian method could compensate for the lack of prior knowledge in data processing and identify the corresponding relationship of parameters in the real time environment to accurately determine the water quality status and make effective emergency strategies rao et al 2021 the empirical curve fitting is impaired when samples do not represent the full complexity of the water system therefore vigiak and bende michl 2013 took advantage of the considerable parametric flexibility in bayesian inference to provide daily and monthly load estimates however few studies have considered the use of bns for quantitative uncertainty assessments of water environment water resources carrying state risks mishra et al 2018 to fill the gap in current research on the uncertainty overloading risk of the wecc wrcc we propose a bn based method system to quantify the ensemble of wecc and wrcc named water environment water resources carrying capacity wercc which includes the uncertainty accounting of wecc and wrcc the innovations of this study are as follows 1 bayesian theory is applied to the uncertainty accounting of wecc and wrcc and bayesian parameter estimation is used to modify the priori historical experience the combination of subjective judgment and objective monitoring provides a more comprehensive description of the carrying capacity of the water system 2 the combination of wercc theory computer programming and data science overcomes the singularity of traditional methods and obtains a more relevant uncertainty description of the actual water system 3 water quality and water quantity support and pressure are unified in bns modeling and various sources of information are utilized to assess responses of complex water systems to human activities this study makes two contributions which are 1 solving the problem to quantify the stochastic uncertainty of wecc wrcc and wep and constructing an uncertainty wercc accounting method based on bayesian probability and statistics 2 introducing the bn theory to analyze the causal chains of water systems and quantify their dependencies constructing a bn model for wercc overloading risk assessment and comprehensively analyzing the basin scale distributions of water environment and water resources overloading states this study takes the north canal basin as an example and proposes targeted management and regulation measures for different overloading risk areas the rest of this paper is structured as section 2 presents the main materials and methods of this study uncertainty analysis results of the wecc wrcc and wep based on section 2 3 1 and the bn based wercc overloading risk assessment and zoning according to section 2 3 2 are presented in section 3 discussions on the introduced method and demonstration results are presented in section 4 followed by the conclusion in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the north canal 39 20 40 26 n 115 52 117 31 e is one of the rivers with the highest level of population industry and urbanization in the haihe river basin in china fig 1 its water pollution problem is also the most serious the mainstream passes through beijing hebei and tianjin in turn from the northwest and finally joins the haihe river in tianjin the total length is approximately 143 km and the basin area is 4348 km2 zhang et al 2021 the north canal basin is in a temperate continental monsoon climate zone with hot rainy summers and dry cold winters the average annual rainfall is approximately 643 mm with over 80 of the rainfall mainly falling between june and september according to statistics from the past 10 years the water flowing out of beijing accounts for 72 90 of the total water volume of the north canal the downstream rivers have very little natural runoff and rely on sewage treatment plant water and other types of sewage as their main sources of water therefore the north canal is essentially incapable of self purification the main pollution indicators are ammonia nitrogen nh3 n chemical oxygen demand cod and total phosphorus tp with nh3 n being the most prominent hou et al 2022 in 2017 the annual gross domestic product gdp of the basin was approximately 246 908 million with a population of 18 87 million an annual average runoff of 439 million cubic meters and an annual water volume of 893 million cubic meters in short the large dense packed population and the emphasis on economic development whatever the cost have led to the north canal being the basin with the highest water scarcity index zeng et al 2013 2 2 data sources most of the data in this study were obtained from

provided the non point pollution data which were obtained by the dpers diffuse pollution estimation with remote sensing non point source pollution assessment model the data such as water resources were from the previous research results of our group https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 7696245 considering the data availability the time span of this study is from 2008 to 2017 in addition the parameters involved in the uncertainty analysis for wecc wrcc and wep are detailed in supporting information 2 3 methods in this study the basin wercc overloading risk assessment method system fig 2 includes qualitative analysis of the relevant elements of the water environment carrying system quantitative uncertainty accounting and analysis based on the bayesian formula and a bn based wercc overloading risk assessment model 2 3 1 uncertainty accounting of the wecc based on the bayesian formula 2 3 1 1 theoretical basis of bayesian statistical inference the bayesian statistical inference based on observed data estimates parameters and state variables through conditional posterior distributions the key difference from the frequentist framework is that the parameters are treated as random variables rather than fixed values kim and pearl 1983 pearl 1988 before any data can be obtained or any data can be fitted to a model the distribution that the parameters may obey needs to be determined assumed which is the prior distribution p θ the prior distribution contains uncertainty about the parameters the probability distribution of the available data d with a given parameter θ is often called the likelihood function p d θ indicating the extent to which the model parameters fit the measured data the posterior probability p θ d is the revised or updated probability after taking into consideration new information which is calculated by updating p θ using bayes theorem pearl 1986 1 p θ d p d θ p θ p d in contrast to the traditional deterministic wecc calculation see supporting information text s1 for detailed steps the basic steps of the uncertainty wecc accounting based on the bayesian formula are the same however the difference is that the parameters of the latter are random variables subject to a probability distribution rather than a certain value so it is necessary to determine the posterior distribution corresponding to each parameter 2 3 1 2 distribution of the comprehensive attenuation coefficient of pollutants it is a well known fact that the pollutants discharged into natural water bodies disappear slowly with time the removal of pollutants from a water body without any artificial controls is called self purification the mechanisms of self purification of water bodies can be divided into three groups physical processes chemical processes and biological processes comprehensive attenuation coefficient refers to the rate of pollutant degradation in the water body and its physical meaning is the daily or hourly percentage of pollutant degradation in the water body it is related to pollutant degradability water temperature and other hydrological conditions see text s1 in the supporting information for details the comprehensive attenuation coefficient k of the pollutants is calibrated according to the bayesian equation pearl 1986 2 p k d p d k p k p d where k is the comprehensive attenuation coefficient of pollutants which is a random variable p k d is the posterior distribution of parameter k that is the normalized result distribution of parameter k which represents the distribution pattern of model parameters after the observation data are obtained d is the sample information p k is the prior distribution function of the parameter k which mainly derives from the past observation data experience and subjective judgment p d k is the likelihood function which indicates the degree of goodness of fit of the model parameters to the measured data see text s5 3 in the supporting information for details since p d is a constant term the posterior probability of the parameter is proportional to the product of the likelihood function and the prior probability pearl 1988 3 p k d p d k p k a straight steady flowing non tributary confluent and non inlet discharge section of the river is used as the study object to determine the actual pollutant concentration data d and the water quality model the loss function is used to quantify the difference in the probability distribution between the model output and the observed results the squared error loss function is chosen to compare the difference between the calculated value l 2 and the actual value l 2 the likelihood function p d k of the observed samples for the parameter k is 4 p d k i 1 n 1 l 2 l 2 1 l 2 l 2 n where l 2 is the actual value of pollutant concentration at the end of the reach l 2 is the pollutant concentration at the same location calculated by the selected water quality model n denotes the number of a series of independent identically distributed data in d the parameter k is determined by minimization of the loss function in this study the p d k is not required to adhere to normalization constraints as its absolute value is of little importance the primary focus lies in the alterations to the p d k as the k varies a larger p d k signifies a more plausible choice for the k finally the product of the likelihood function and the prior probability is normalized to obtain the posterior probability p k d of the parameter k 2 3 1 3 distribution of other parameters 1 flow and flow rate the pearson type iii p iii curve is a widely used frequency curve line type in hydrological frequency calculations also known as the gamma distribution according to historical experience most hydrological parameters obey the p iii type distribution hu et al 2023 based on the monthly flow data of each hydrological station over the years the parameters of the p iii curve are estimated by the commonly used method of moments then the theoretical and empirical frequencies are compared based on the optimal line fitting method and the optimal parameters are selected finally the probability distribution of flow is determined the details can be found in the text s4 and text s5 1 after obtaining the estimated distribution of parameters for the flow the flow rate distribution and the flow distribution have the corresponding empirical relationship as follows 5 u a q b where u is the flow rate m s q is the flow m3 s a and b are hydraulic parameters i e empirical parameters determined from the measured data 2 background concentration and water quality target the determination of the background concentration distribution was based on the analysis of the actual monitored water quality data at the head of each reach data observation and data fitting analysis were performed using r project programming to determine the distributions the water quality target for each reach is the mathematical expectation value of the background water quality concentration in the corresponding reach text s5 2 and figure s2 in the supporting information for details 2 3 1 4 posterior distribution of wecc the wecc w is calculated based on the bayesian equation pearl 1988 6 p w d p d w p w first it is assumed that w belongs to a certain normal prior distribution p w with the standard deviation of σ then using the obtained parameter distributions random sampling is performed on each parameter for widely utilized distributions such as the gamma distribution the r language offers a convenient sampling function called rgamma to sample from the p k d the acceptance rejection sampling ars can be employed finally the calculated water quality value c at the end of the reach was compared with the water quality target concentration c s based on the se loss function to obtain the likelihood function p d w for the observed sample of w ma et al 2020 7 p d w i 1 n 1 2 π σ 2 e x p c i c s i 2 2 σ 2 the posterior distribution p w d of w can be calculated according to the equations 6 7 2 3 2 bn based structure and modeling for wercc overloading risk assessment a bn is a directed acyclic graph dag consisting of a set of random variables nodes and the dependencies between parent and child nodes are quantified by the cpts korb nicholson 2010 a bn is defined in terms of two components maldonado et al 2019 qualitative component in a graphical inference network each vertex represents a variable within the model and the presence of an edge e connecting two vertices signifies the existence of statistical dependence between the associated variables quantitative component for each variable x i i 1 v in the graph a conditional probability distribution p x i p a x i is determined where pa x i denotes the set of parent variables associated with x i the prior probability distributions associated with the parent nodes are denoted as the edge probability tables epts while the probability tables characterizing the dependencies between child nodes and their respective parent nodes are referred to as cpts in bns given the establishment of input variable probabilities and the assumption of conditional independence the joint probability distribution p x can be represented as the product of the conditional probabilities for each random variable ghahramani 2015 8 p x i 1 v p x i p a x i where the random variable node x x 1 x 2 x v is the set of all variable nodes in the bns the variable x i is conditionally independent from all non descendants given its parent nodes pa x i in bns each parent node p a x i has its prior probability distribution in different states while the causal relationship between the remaining nodes is determined by the conditional probability function the sum of the probability values of all nodes in cpts and epts at each state is 1 based on the characteristics of the dataset a bn with a reasonable structure and probability distribution was constructed by analyzing the existing dataset figure s11 bn modeling mainly consisted of two parts 1 defining the state values of nodes as discretized values conditions or criteria and 2 computing the cpts 2 3 2 1 overloading risk assessment mechanism for the wecc overloading risk cod nh3 n and tp could be selected as indicators for consideration the overloading of the wecc in the basin could be assessed by analyzing the wecc and the number of pollutants entering the river for the wrcc overloading risk what must be considered was whether the available water resources in the water systems could meet the water demand for human production and life 2 3 2 2 relevant variable selection and processing in the bn model each node corresponds to a different variable when fewer variables are selected the accuracy of the evaluation results will be low in contrast it is easy to absorb some noise variables thus affecting the soundness of the bn construction the efficiency of the model operation and the accuracy of the evaluation another consideration is the availability quantification degree and relevance of variable related data in the actual modeling process for complex environmental systems that lack data expert knowledge is an important source of information that can provide experience for quantitative simulation and prediction in the system in the bn model of comprehensive wecc overloading risk assessment nodes variables could be divided into three types 1 indicator layer risk factors root nodes the root nodes are usually the quantitative variables for these risk factors including the environmental carrying capacity of pollutants the number of pollutants entering the river the availability of water resources and the total water consumption 2 middle layer elements intermediate nodes the intermediate nodes facilitate a more reasonable quantitative evaluation of the target layer including the single factor carrying capacity overloading risk nodes cod carrying capacity overloading risk nh3 n carrying capacity overloading risk tp carrying capacity overloading risk wrcc overloading risk and multi factor overloading risk nodes wecc overloading risk 3 evaluation target layer target node different from the first two types of nodes there is usually only one target node that is the purpose of the comprehensive evaluation of the system the target node can be set as wercc overloading risk the relevant variable processing includes missing value processing singular value removal variable distribution pattern analysis data discretization processing and so on in the actual modeling process continuous variables are usually discretized because bns based on discrete variables are more efficient in construction and operation in addition the variables of the intermediate and target nodes need to determine their dependencies on the child nodes that is the corresponding cpts should be given 2 3 2 3 determine the network structure the key to constructing a bn structure is to study the influence processes of each overloading risk i e their causal relationships and the interrelationships between different processes and then comprehensively analyze and visualize all causal chains first starting with the risk factors each random variable in section 2 3 2 2 is plotted as a node in the network structure second the topology of the bayesian network figure s11 is constructed based on the framework of the wercc overloading risk assessment method system in the basin fig 2 and the root node intermediate node target node risk transfer mechanism after that the cpts need to be adjusted to quantify the causal relationship by combining expert experience and linear interpolation method ban et al 2014 the extreme cases are first set to 0 or 100 risk experts and local stakeholders including government managers enterprise leaders and local residents are then invited to complete the probability tables for the combinations of variables finally the interpolation factors are calculated by nemerow index text s3 and the conditional probabilities for the remaining states are interpolated in some cases the network structure may not be static and will be modified and adjusted based on the model evaluation results and actual needs 3 results 3 1 uncertainty calculation of the wecc based on the bayesian formula according to the deterministic wecc results of each reach at different guarantee rates see table s1 table s3 in the supporting information for details the normal prior distribution p w of the wecc of each calculation unit was set accordingly using the obtained distributions for each parameter see text s5 and figures s1 s5 in the supporting information for details random sampling was performed for each parameter according to the square error loss function the water quality c at the end of the reach was compared with the target water quality concentration c s and the likelihood function p d w of the observed samples with the parameter w was obtained according to the product of the likelihood function and the prior probability the posterior distribution p w d of w was obtained 3 1 1 wecc of cod the probability density distributions of the cod wecc in the north canal basin are shown in fig 3 a except for cu5 which was left skewed all of the other reaches were right skewed compared with the standard normal distribution with the kurtosis of 3 the kurtosis of each distribution was less than 3 which belonged to the thin tailed distribution the parameters of the uncertainty cod wecc accounting results are shown in table 1 the main flow control units cu1 cu2 cu3 cu4 and cu5 of the north canal were characterized by higher pollutant concentrations higher flows and larger weccs with the expected weccs mostly above 10 000 t a the maximum expected value of the wecc for mainstream in the whole area was cu2 45 600 t a and the minimum expected value was cu5 6881 5 t a except for cu7 with high flow and cu8 with high flow and long reaches the wecc of each tributary control unit was relatively small at 10 800 t a and 21 500 t a respectively cu6 had the smallest expected wecc 782 1 t a fig 4 a shows the position of the deterministic cod wecc values see table s1 on the cumulative probability distribution diagram the deterministic wecc with different guarantee rates basically followed the trend of the probability distribution of the uncertain wecc 3 1 2 wecc of nh3 n fig 3b shows the probability density distribution of the nh3 n wecc in the north canal basin from the nh3 n wecc distribution of each control unit the two control units cu4 and cu7 were left skewed and the rest of the reaches were right skewed all distributions were thin tailed the parameters of the uncertain nh3 n wecc accounting results are shown in table 2 the distribution pattern of the nh3 n wecc was similar to that of cod the expected values of wecc for all five control units in the mainstream were above 100 t a the maximum expected value of the wecc in the mainstream of the whole region was cu2 1880 04 t a and the minimum expected value was cu5 108 35 t a the tributary control units had relatively small weccs only cu7 and cu8 with 440 46 t a and 643 81 t a respectively cu6 had the smallest expected wecc 18 44 t a fig 4b shows the cumulative probability distribution of the nh3 n wecc and its corresponding relationship with the deterministic wecc see table s2 the deterministic wecc under different guarantee rates basically conformed to the trend of the probability distribution of the uncertain wecc the prior information based on the actual monitoring data was adjusted and modified by the bayesian method 3 1 3 wecc of tp the probability density distribution of the tp wecc is shown in fig 3c from the tp wecc distribution of each control unit the four control units on cu4 cu5 cu7 and cu8 were left skewed and the rest of the rivers were right skewed all of which belong to a thin tailed distribution the parameters of the uncertainty tp wecc accounting results are shown in table 3 the distribution pattern of the tp wecc was similar to that of the nh3 n and cod weccs most of the weccs expected values for the five control units in the mainstream of the north canal were above 100 t a the maximum expected value of the wecc in the mainstream of the whole basin was cu2 457 84 t a and the minimum expected value was cu5 69 08 t a the tributary control units had relatively small weccs only cu7 and cu8 with 111 13 t a and 216 37 t a respectively cu6 had the smallest expected wecc 7 51 t a fig 4c shows the cumulative probability distribution of the tp wecc and its corresponding relationship with the deterministic wecc see table s3 although the trend of the probability distribution of the deterministic wecc remained more or less the same as that of the uncertain wecc for different guarantee rates it could be seen that the prior information of some control units e g cu9 was more corrected 3 2 uncertainty analysis of wrcc and wep based on probability statistics 3 2 1 probability distribution of the wrcc the wrcc considering the water quantity dimension refers to the ability of water bodies to supply water resources to humans for specific wrcc issues the wrcc was usually expressed in terms of the number of available water resources li et al 2019 the analysis methods of water availability are detailed in the supporting information text s1 the monthly data of surface water resources swrs available and groundwater resources grs available were summed to obtain the monthly data of the total available water resources and their distribution was further analyzed to obtain the probability distribution of water availability as shown in figure s6 the available water resources in the north canal basin obeyed a skewed distribution cu5 and cu8 had the most abundant available water resources the available water resources at cu8 had the highest probability density at approximately 21 million t m while cu5 was at approximately 17 million t m cu10 had a relatively small amount of available water resources with the highest probability density of less than 1 million t m control units with relatively scarce available water resources included cu6 and cu9 3 2 2 probability distribution of wep 3 2 2 1 cod inflow figure s7 shows the probability density distribution of cod inflow for each control unit in the north canal basin and the expected values of point and nonpoint source inflows are shown in table s4 the total cod inflow per control unit did not vary much and the expected value of the total inflow was approximately 10 000 t a however the cod inflow varied considerably among the control units among them the cod inflows in cu2 cu7 and cu8 were relatively large at 35435 81 t a 24580 32 t a and 13038 92 t a respectively however cu4 and cu6 had the smallest total inflows of less than 500 t a in the control units with large cod inflows the proportion of point source pollution was as high as 98 control units with relatively small cod inflows accounted for a relatively high proportion of cod nonpoint source pollution cu6 accounted for 63 2 and cu4 accounted for 75 6 3 2 2 2 nh3 n inflow figure s8 shows the probability density distribution of nh3 n inflow for each control unit in the north canal basin and the expected values of point and nonpoint source inflows are shown in table s5 the variation of the total nh3 n inflow for each control unit was also small and the expected value of the total inflow was approximately 500 t a however the nh3 n inflow varied greatly among the control units among them cu1 cu2 cu7 and cu8 had relatively large nh3 n inflows 1970 95 t a 725 85 t a 665 36 t a and 421 83 t a respectively however the total inflows of cu4 cu5 and cu6 were the smallest less than 50 t a in the control units with large nh3 n inflows the proportion of point source pollution was up to 90 or more the proportion of nh3 n nonpoint source pollution was relatively high in the control units with relatively small nh3 n inflows cu6 accounted for 94 3 and cu4 accounted for 89 6 3 2 2 3 tp inflow figure s9 shows the probability density distribution of tp inflow for each control unit in the north canal basin and the expected values of point and nonpoint source inflows are shown in table s6 the variation in the total tp inflow for each control unit was also small with an expected value of the total inflow being approximately 100 t a however the tp inflow varied greatly among the control units among them cu1 and cu2 had relatively large tp inflows 345 19 t a 241 04 t a and 137 56 t a respectively however the total inflows of cu4 cu5 and cu9 were the smallest less than 10 t a the percentage of point source pollution was as high as 97 in the control units with large tp inflows control units with relatively small tp inflows accounted for a relatively high proportion of tp nonpoint source pollution the point source pollution was almost zero for cu5 while the nonpoint source pollution accounted for 93 for cu4 3 2 2 4 total water use water resources in the basin are divided into three main parts namely agricultural water domestic water and industrial water in general agriculture in the beijing tianjin hebei region has been dominated by aquaculture li et al 2019 in this study the annual data of the total water use in each control unit were distributed as monthly data and their probability distributions were further analyzed the probability density distribution of total water use in the north canal basin is shown in figure s10 the control units in the middle reach cu2 cu7 and cu8 consumed the largest amount of water mainly due to the large population and high level of urbanization in this area and the domestic water consumption was much higher than that in other areas this is followed by the control units in the upper reaches such as cu6 where most of the upper reaches were mountainous with low population density and high agricultural water consumption the control units in the middle and lower reaches of the basin such as cu4 and cu9 had large cultivation areas and a high volume of livestock and poultry breeding the primary industry was relatively developed and the agricultural water consumption was relatively large 3 3 bn based wercc overloading risk assessment and zoning 3 3 1 identify network nodes table 4 and table 5 represent the overloading risk module nodes for the wecc and wrcc respectively table s7 shows the water environment carrying rates and the corresponding overloading states the nemerow index was introduced in the multifactor carrying capacity overloading risk calculation which considered the average and maximum values of the single factor carrying capacity overloading risk and highlighted the influence and effect of the most severe overloading factor the calculation equations can be found in the supporting information text s3 3 3 2 bn structure and running results figure s11 shows the bn structure of the wercc overloading risk in the basin the target node wercc overloading risk was represented by a rectangle and there were also 8 root nodes and 5 intermediate nodes represented by ellipses the two child nodes of the target node were wecc overloading risk and wrcc overloading risk which measured the water quality and quantity respectively table 6 shows the cpt of the wercc overloading risk the wercc overloading risks for cu6 in the upper reaches fig 5 cu2 in the middle reaches fig 6 and cu5 in the lowest reaches fig 7 were taken as examples to analyze the model running results the results of the other control units performances are shown in figure s12 s18 of the supporting information 3 3 2 1 take cu6 as an example the overall risk probabilities of cu6 being at r1 r2 r3 and r4 were 0 18 5 79 30 1 and 64 0 respectively the probability of severe overloading was the highest followed by the probability of moderate overloading and mild overloading the wercc in this unit was overloaded seriously in terms of the risk of wecc overloading there was a 53 6 probability of moderate overloading conditions and a 43 0 probability of severe overloading conditions in terms of the risk of wrcc overloading the unit had a relatively developed primary industry with high agricultural and residential water use however due to the low flow in the upper reaches of the basin the available water resources were insufficient therefore there was a 66 6 probability that the wrcc overloading condition was considered a severe risk 3 3 2 2 take cu2 as an example the overall risk of cu2 was at 2 16 15 6 39 6 and 42 7 probability of being at r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively the probability of being in severe and moderate overloading was the highest and the probability of not overloading was very low at 2 16 in general the wercc overloading of cu2 was not promising since cu2 was located in the middle reaches of the basin covering part of central beijing more point source pollution put some pressure on the water supply system for the wecc overloading risk submodule the cod carrying capacity overloading risk was the most serious and almost distributed in a moderate overloading state the nh3 n carrying capacity overloading risk was basically in a slight overloading state the tp was in good carrying condition and there was no overloading risk at all therefore the wecc was most likely to be in a slight and moderate overloading state for the wrcc overloading risk submodule the severe overloading accounted for 64 9 mainly because the urban domestic water consumption was large and the water system was prone to a water supply shortage resulting in water resources overloading 3 3 2 3 take cu5 as an example the probabilities that the wercc overloading risk of cu5 was at r1 r2 r3 and r4 were 87 9 5 61 5 27 and 1 17 respectively indicating a relatively positive overall situation the two submodules wecc and wrcc also had a nonoverloaded carrying capacity status with a high probability cu5 covering the most downstream area of the mainstream also had the largest flow and its ability to digest pollutants was strong so the water quality was better than that of the other cus both the cod and tp carrying capacity overloading risks were nonoverloaded with a probability of 100 and the nh3 n carrying capacity overloading risk was nonoverloaded with a probability of 99 4 for the wrcc overloading risk this control unit had fewer industrial production activities more agricultural water demand and more water resources in the downstream of the basin therefore the wrcc was not overloaded with a probability of 87 4 but there would still be the possibility of overloading or even severe overloading 3 3 3 overloading risk zoning in the north canal basin the four overloading states r1 r2 r3 and r4 were assigned to 1 2 3 and 4 respectively and the corresponding overloading risk indexes of the target units were determined using equation s9 see supporting information based on the results of the wercc overloading risk assessment for the north canal figs 5 7 and figure s12 s18 different overloading risk zones were obtained table s9 accordingly the north canal control units were divided into four types of areas slight overloading risk area r r i s k i n d e x 1 00 1 25 mild overloading risk area r r i s k i n d e x 1 25 2 25 moderate overloading risk area r r i s k i n d e x 2 25 3 25 and severe overloading risk area r r i s k i n d e x 3 25 4 00 figure s19 shows the distribution of the wercc overloading risk in the north canal among them cu3 and cu5 were slight overloading risk areas cu1 and cu4 were mild overloading risk areas cu6 and cu9 were severe overloading risk areas the remaining control units were moderate overloading risk areas 4 discussion 4 1 about the study case climate change and anthropogenic activities jointly impact the carrying capacity of water systems variations in meteorological parameters such as temperature and precipitation induce alterations in the water cycle processes within a basin substantially increasing the likelihood of extreme hydrological events including floods and droughts yin et al 2021 yin et al 2023 human activities can modify land use patterns and vegetation cover as well as generate point and nonpoint source pollution the implementation of water management infrastructure can induce static water flows sedimentation of particulate matter transported from upstream sources and a decline in the self purification capacity of water bodies collectively these factors contribute to a diminished wecc barnett et al 2005 wang et al 2019a b as illustrated in fig 3 the control unit exhibits an increased wecc in correspondence with longer channels and higher river flows this occurs as extended periods of low flows or droughts can lead to increased retention time for pollutants within the water system yin et al 2023 for example cu2 with the largest expected value of the wecc has the longest river with a length of 45 10 km into which many tributaries converge in contrast rivers with low flows and short lengths have smaller wecc values for example cu6 which has the smallest expected wecc value has a length of 10 23 km and small flows concentrated below 3 m3 s in comparison although cu3 has a shorter river length of approximately 8 92 km the flows are relatively large concentrated in the range of 20 m3 s 30 m3 s and its wecc is also relatively large the background concentration exerts an influence on the distribution of the wecc however the disparities in background concentration distributions across various river reaches are relatively subtle chen et al 2010 conducted a thorough analysis demonstrating that within the wecc influence factor the design flow was identified as the most sensitive input parameter followed by the comprehensive attenuation coefficient in terms of the influencing factors of the wecc the wecc in the study area is mainly affected by the flow and the length of the river segment followed by the background concentration and the water quality target concentration which is similar to the study results of stow and borsuk 2003 compared with the traditional design conditions of deterministic wecc accounting zhang et al 2015 the uncertain wecc accounting based on the bayesian theory not only reflects the information contained in the former and uses prior knowledge to ensure the reasonableness and accuracy of the results stow et al 2007 it is a relatively new and intuitive probability distribution of the wecc which is conducive to the refined management of the water environment in the basin the method has a certain degree of universality and is equally applicable to other study areas and other pollutant indicators alameddine et al 2011 as shown in figure s7 figure s9 spatially the control units with higher cod nh3 n and tp inflows are mostly located in the middle reaches of the basin and the inflows are mostly from point source pollution while the control units with lower cod nh3 n and tp inflows are mostly from the upper or lower reaches of the basin with a higher proportion of nonpoint source pollution this might be because there are more large scale centralized treatment facilities in the middle reaches of the basin with higher sewage treatment capacity and wastewater treatment volume and high point source discharges the upper reaches areas such as cu6 are mostly located in mountainous areas with more rural domestic sewage discharges the lower reaches of the basin have a relatively high proportion of the primary industries the high application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers and large scale livestock breeding have caused serious related pollution as a result rural domestic nonpoint source pollution agricultural cultivation source pollution and livestock breeding source pollution are all higher in the lower reach areas when compared to the middle and upper reaches resulting in a relatively high proportion of nonpoint source pollution in the upper and lower reaches of the basin wang et al 2019a b the inadequate ecological recharge downstream is another contributing factor to the suboptimal water quality global climate change is exerting a significant influence on regional precipitation trends leading to their continual evolution the heightened spatial heterogeneity of precipitation patterns and an increase in the heterogeneity of water resource distribution within the basin yin et al 2021 regarding spatial distribution the mean annual precipitation amounts to 582 mm in the middle reaches of the north canal basin while approximately 565 mm is observed in middle and lower reaches notably annual precipitation exhibits its nadir in both the upper and lower reaches to a certain degree precipitation functions as a source of clean water with increased precipitation levels positively correlating to larger wecc wang et al 2019a b nevertheless it generates surface runoff potentially leading to nonpoint source pollution yin et al 2022a b moreover it has been demonstrated that a confluence of factors including precipitation patterns topographic features vegetative coverage and soil composition collectively exert an impact on nonpoint source pollution alvarez cobelas et al 2008 unlike the uncertainty analysis based on the bayesian theory the data fitting analysis on the basis of r project can study the unknown distribution in the absence of prior distribution this is undoubtedly a more comprehensive and accurate description of the random variables and lays the foundation for the wercc overloading risk assessment borsuk et al 2002 1 slight overloading risk area including cu3 and cu5 these two control units are in good water environment condition with a low risk of overloading and little need for special measures particularly in terms of water quality this is because they are in the middle and lower reaches of the basin where flows and corresponding weccs are high and the pollution loads are relatively low zhang et al 2018 however in terms of water use cu5 still has a certain potential for water overloading nearly 10 mainly due to the high demand for water for agriculture caused by its developed level of agriculture therefore in terms of water resource utilization relevant measures can be taken to prevent water shortages from occurring given its water use situation the main considerations are to improve water use efficiency accelerate the construction of efficient water saving agriculture strengthen rain fed agriculture and adjust the water use structure qi et al 2021 in addition it is also possible to increase the utilization rate of recycled water strengthen the construction of water storage and water saving facilities and improve the efficiency of agricultural irrigation from an economic point of view the popularization of rational water use and water conservation can be promoted through for example the imposition of a water tax 2 mild overloading risk area including cu1 and cu4 these two control units have essentially no wecc overloading mainly because their weccs are relatively large and have a better capacity to absorb pollutants however the environment carrying state of water resources is not ideal with these two control units having nearly half the probability of wrcc overloading mainly due to the large scale of agricultural production and high agricultural water consumption cu1 is relatively scarce in terms of water supply there is a need to strengthen the construction of water storage water saving reuse and water saving facilities especially agricultural water conservation and rational water distribution regional water transfers can also be considered to solve the water supply problem chung et al 2021 cu4 in the lower reaches needs attention to rational water allocation and policies related to strengthening efficient water use in agriculture garcia et al 2016 3 moderate overloading risk area including the control units of cu2 cu7 cu8 and cu10 these three control units cu2 cu7 and cu8 are located in the middle reaches of the north canal basin they are also the three units covering the central city of beijing they all have developed regional economies with a high proportion of the tertiary industries and high population densities the pollution is relatively high and the demand for domestic water is large wu et al 2020 the water pollution comes mainly from point sources which are concentrated in urban domestic sewage and sewage treatment plant discharges there is a high proportion of urban domestic water use there is a need to reduce the direct discharge of domestic sewage strengthen the prevention and control of water pollution and improve the capacity and efficiency of sewage treatment zhang et al 2021 in addition a leading group for comprehensive water pollution control could be established to strengthen law enforcement and supervision and strictly control the total amount of pollutants discharged for the water resources problem in the city water prices should be reasonably adjusted regional water transfer should be implemented and the concept of water conservation be strengthened gonzales and ajami 2017 cu10 is located in the lower part of the basin this area is dominated by primary industries the pollution comes mainly from emissions from agricultural cultivation sources and livestock breeding sources the agricultural water consumption is also high it could strengthen the construction of organic fertilizer plants the treatment of pollutants such as livestock and poultry manure and the ecological restoration of agricultural drainage ditches 4 severe overloading risk area including cu6 and cu9 wu et al 2020 suggested that the water quality in the upper and lower reaches of the north canal was generally better than that in the middle reaches however the superiority of water quality is not fully equivalent to the level of wercc overloading risk cu6 is located in the upper reaches of the basin and has a smaller wecc and fewer available water resources the large proportion of the primary industries leads to a high level of agricultural and domestic nonpoint source pollution cu9 is located in the middle and lower reaches of the basin and the situation is similar to that of cu6 that is the water consumption for agriculture and domestic purposes is relatively high for water quality problems the equipment could be optimized by improving the scale and the treatment capacity of sewage treatment plants rationalizing the design of recycled water reuse pathways and improving the efficiency of agricultural fertilizers application for water resources problems the use of reclaimed water and sewage could be increased by transferring water from outside the region increasing the penetration of water saving appliances in rural areas and placing emphasis on the development and application of recycled water reuse technology 4 2 about limitations and perspectives 1 the uncertainty analysis involved in this study is a process of data analysis based on probability statistics and computer programming and the quality and the quantity of data are crucial some of the data in this study need to be further improved e g the number of monitoring sections and point sources in the future studies with the intelligence and refinement of data storage the environmental data sources will be correspondingly more comprehensive and accurate thus laying a solid foundation for a more reasonable data analysis 2 the basin wercc overloading risk assessment methodological system proposed in this study mainly considers the water environment subsystem and water resources subsystem but not the water ecology subsystem this is because the water ecology subsystem involves factors and indicators that are difficult to quantify e g the damage to water ecology caused by human activities however water quality and water quantity can also reflect the water ecology health to a large extent to further improve the methodological system it should be considered to integrate the water ecology factors and analyze them qualitatively and quantitatively 3 although the corresponding relationships across cus and between upstream and downstream of river sections were considered during the wecc modeling and data preparation stages soil and water assessment tool production and sink model hydrological model etc the spatial dependence between cus was not considered in the process of constructing the basin wercc overloading risk assessment framework in the future researches a bayesian network model can be developed across cus at the whole basin scale 4 a noted limitation of the bn modeling approach has been its difficulty in considering spatial dynamics within a system when the system is dynamical e g water system bn can only be applied when the time horizon is not too long castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 static bns cannot capture the spatial feedback mechanisms within the system due to their acyclic framework morrison and stone 2014 future optimizations will be made in terms of a exploring the relationship between the number of model samples indicator state changes and model output results to obtain the most significant impact factors b introducing more impact factors e g ecological variables to generate different cpts and analyzing the impact mechanisms of overloading risk events that have occurred c coupling the hydrodynamic models e g mike21 and bn modeling framework to explicitly account for effects of dynamic changes on wercc overloading evaluation 5 the proposed wercc overloading risk assessment framework in this study has a generic nature and can be applied at a larger watershed regional scale however it is insufficient to solely consider human activities as future climate stress is expected to worsen water scarcity and exert pressure on water systems li and sivapalan 2020 with climate warming the intensity of precipitation increases exponentially leading to exacerbated flood conditions yin et al 2021 yin et al 2022a b additionally numerous studies have demonstrated that compound drought heat wave events have become significant climate stressors for global sustainability yin et al 2023 these climate changes have amplified the adverse impacts on water system sustainability and human well being given the increasing frequency of compound climate risks future research should focus on better preparing adaptation and mitigation solutions yin et al 2022a b 5 conclusions in this study the uncertainty accounting method of the wercc in the basin including the wecc and wrcc is discussed according to the connotation of the wercc and the corresponding uncertainty wep is considered a risk assessment generic model framework for wercc overloading based on bns in the basin has been developed taking the north canal basin as an example the areas at risk of moderate to severe overloading for wercc are concentrated in the middle and upper reaches mainly in economically developed areas such as the central urban areas of beijing and the more agriculturally developed upper and middle reaches fringe areas densely populated economically developed areas have high water pressure and serious water pollution however in the more agriculturally developed areas agricultural water consumption is large and pollutant emissions from agricultural cultivation sources and pollution from livestock and poultry sources are more serious overall this study is of particular importance for the scientific understanding of the contradictions between the water system and human society and for the coordinated and sustainable development of the water environment and water resources in the basin region 6 open research 6 1 data

emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief the responses of ecosystem water use efficiency wue to environmental perturbations are non linearly dependent on how strongly coupled are water and carbon cycling here we evaluate the structure of these non linearities using two high fidelity explainable machine learning xml models to disentangle the confounding effects of the air temperature ta precipitation pr downward shortwave radiation sr atmospheric co2 concentration ca and nitrogen deposition ndep on wue the findings suggest that mean annual pr plays a dominant role in shaping the spatial pattern of wue spatially wue responded positively to pr and ca but negatively to ta and sr while ndep had little impact on wue for temporal trends the spatial pattern of the mean annual wue determined the spatial pattern of the wue trend furthermore the spatial patterns of the ndep and ca trends also contributed substantially to the spatial pattern of the wue trend notably the wue and ca trends exhibited negative correlations while the wue and ndep trends showed positive or negative correlations depending on the different nutrient constraints on vegetation the wue growth rate responded negatively to sr in both spatial patterns and temporal trends additionally using the trend of 0 077 k yr 1 and 0 mm yr 1 as the threshold the trends of ta and pr shifted from positive to negative relationships on wue growth our results help identify key sensitivities and thresholds in wue to environmental controls over space and time keywords water use efficiency ecosystem climate change machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial ecosystem water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp to evapotranspiration et represents the trade off between carbon sequestration and water consumption at the ecosystem scale cooley et al 2022 m huang et al 2015 wue reflects the coupling of the regional and global carbon and water cycles and the adaptability of vegetation in different ecosystems and various periods therefore understanding the spatiotemporal changes in the responses of wue to environmental forces is important for making reliable projections of future carbon water coupling to date many studies have shown that the global temporal increase of wue is primarily driven by variations in atmospheric co2 concentration ca and nitrogen deposition ndep b el masri et al 2019 bassil el masri et al 2021 m huang et al 2015 traore et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 and climatic factors are considered to increase zhou et al 2017 or decrease wue b el masri et al 2019 however at the regional or local scale the responses of wue to these variables remain unclear because different ecosystems have distinct characteristics associated with species composition and plant function types the exchanges of water and carbon fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere vary temporally and geographically cooley et al 2022 nemani et al 2003 ponton et al 2006 resulting in contrasting responses of wue to environmental drivers regional analysis is therefore imperative to clarify the spatial and temporal responses of wue to potential drivers to gain a targeted understanding of local c h2o coupling relationships in the context of climate change in the past three decades climatic conditions have significantly shifted and both ca and ndep have increased significantly particularly in china with industrial development guirui yu et al 2019 as a result many studies have sought to examine the spatial and temporal variations of wue with these factors in china bai et al 2020 g li et al 2021 s sun et al 2018 g yu et al 2008 q zhu et al 2011 x j zhu et al 2015 ca and ndep have been identified as the primary drivers of the global wue increase over the last three decades based on multiple process based models b el masri et al 2019 m huang et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 however regionally the dominant factors of wue must still be determined via individual analyses although it is generally accepted that wue increases with ca walker et al 2021 the level of the wue response to increases in ca remains unclear b el masri et al 2019 and involves a debate on the aggravated nutrient limitation induced by increasing ca giguère croteau et al 2019 van der sleen et al 2015 moreover although the increased addition of ndep will promote photosynthesis terrer et al 2019 y p wang et al 2010 because china s terrestrial vegetation generally suffers from the limitation of nutrient availability du et al 2020 joshua b fisher et al 2012 shao et al 2016 a recent meta analysis showed that nitrogen n addition might not further benefit plant growth when nitrogen limitation is relieved liu et al 2022 in addition high levels of ndep were identified as the dominant factor driving the decline in leaf c n ratio in southern china sheng et al 2021 while the increase in c n ratio is an important mechanism for carbon gains in most vegetation rastetter et al 2022 therefore based on the uncertainty of the different effects of ca and ndep on wue it is necessary to unravel the distinct responses of wue to the trajectories of ca and ndep in various biomes and ecosystems apart from the responses to ca and ndep the role of climatic factors on wue must be explored as contrasting responses of wue to climatic factors including air temperature ta downward shortwave radiation sr and precipitation pr have been observed in previous studies for example s sun et al 2018 and g yu et al 2008 reported that the annual wue decreased with pr and ta while x j zhu et al 2015 suggested that it logarithmically varied with pr and linearly increased with ta in china g li et al 2021 found that wue was positively correlated with ta and p in 50 21 and 66 16 of the areas in china respectively in a global analysis however xue et al 2015 indicated that in most regions wue is positively correlated with pr and specific humidity and negatively correlated with ta and sr the spatial distribution patterns of wue observed in previous studies have also varied for instance bai et al 2020 suggested that wue has higher values in forests and cropland than in shrubland and grassland in china while g li et al 2021 suggested that it has greater values in woodland than in non woodland along the aridity gradient bai et al 2020 found that the value of wue is decreased in arid dry sub humid and semi arid areas in china while ponce campos et al 2013 and tian et al 2010 suggested that wue decreases with the moisture availability these inconsistent conclusions may result from the differences in multi source and multi scale data attribution methods and various study regions making it necessary to prudently assess the response of wue to various climatic variables at the regional scale thus there remains a need to continue studying how wue has responded to the environmental factors in the last three decades across china not only because of the inconsistent conclusions but also because of the necessity to improve the understanding of ecosystem processes and feedback to the climate system as the magnitude and amplitude of climate change continue to expand globally the present study aimed to examine 1 how the spatial variations of environmental variables affect the spatial pattern of wue and 2 how the changes of climatic variables ca and ndep influence the regional trends of wue distinct from existing studies the confounding effects of all the drivers were disentangled and their individualized effects on wue were investigated along the gradients of each variable to this end two explainable machine learning xml models were employed to explore the complicated relationships between wue and its drivers in spatial and temporal terms respectively most current studies on wue in china have been based on observational data and have employed simple unary linear regression for the attribution analysis of environmental factors bai et al 2020 ponce campos et al 2013 xue et al 2015 x j zhu et al 2015 however this traditional unary linear regression distorts the nonlinear relationships between wue and its drivers ignoring the interaction and coupling effects between drivers therefore there are clear advantages to using xml methods to understand better the underlying mechanisms of the relationships between physical quantities and their drivers gevaert 2022 on the one hand complex machine learning methods have high predictive performance in identifying the linear nonlinear relationships between physical quantities thus allowing for exploiting the maximum potential in mining data relationships on the other hand the explanatory ability of xml can manifest the data relationships fitted by machine learning thus enabling the further mining of new knowledge such as the identification of the dominant factors of physical quantities lipton 2016 the visualization of their nonlinear effects and the quantification of the magnitudes of these effects montavon et al 2018 roscher et al 2020 roscher et al 2020 thus in this study xml was employed to obtain the contributions of environmental factors to wue and more importantly to determine how these features contribute to wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 data sources gpp and et data were collected from two independent data products to calculate wue selected by a combination of multi decadal availability resolution and linkage to observations first gpp data were derived from the global land surface satellite glass product the glass gpp is driven by the eddy covariance light use efficiency ec lue model which is based on eddy covariance data and light utilization efficiency theory wenping yuan et al 2010 wenping yuan et al 2007 the latest version of the glass gpp product integrates the forces of ca radiative composition and atmospheric water vapor pressure to accurately indicate long term changes in gpp w yuan et al 2019 the et data were derived from ma et al 2019b the data comprise the terrestrial monthly actual et dataset across china with a spatial resolution of 0 1 these estimates of et in the dataset were derived by the complementary relationship method which is entirely based on atmospheric data and requires no information on vegetation and soil parameters ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2019a meteorological data were sourced from a near surface meteorological and environmental reanalysis dataset namely the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 k yang and he 2019 which has a 0 1 degree spatial resolution and a 3 h temporal resolution three meteorological elements were adopted from the cmfd dataset including the 2 m ta the surface sr and the pr rate to characterize the variation of climatic conditions the accuracy of this dataset is between those of meteorological station observations and satellite derived data as its development was based on remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ observation data from weather stations its characteristics of a long available length high resolution stability and continuity make it preferable to china s meteorological datasets moreover the cmfd data were also the basic atmospheric inputs for the et data adopted in this study therefore they had good coherence with the et data the ca data were derived from a global 0 5 degree model forcing dataset provided by the multi scale synthesis and terrestrial model intercomparison project mstmip wei et al 2014a the mstmip global simulation project is a formal synthesis activity and model intercomparison and evaluation project aimed at improving the diagnosis and attribution of carbon exchange at the local and global scales j b fisher et al 2022 huntzinger et al 2013 the environmental driver data of mstmip is a standardized set of driven data fused from multiple data sources among which the ca data prepared for the mstmip are consistent with the globalview co2 2011 data product and time series of historic ca from multiple observation sites more detailed information about the mstmip has been described in previous studies huntzinger et al 2013 wei et al 2014b moreover the ndep data were obtained from a dataset that was developed from the in site ndep data across china and further quantified by a global aerosol chemical climate model gao et al 2020a gao et al 2020b the dataset combines dry and wet depositions including all forms of nitrogen the attributions of the data products are tabulated in table 1 2 2 data processing all data were reprojected to the world geodetic system 1984 and resampled to a 0 05 0 05 spatial resolution using the bilinear resampling method to study the annual dynamics of wue all data were aggregated into annual averages except for pr and evaporation and thus wue which were resampled to annual total values the ca and ndep data were also used in terms of their annual total amounts the theil sen median and mann kendall trend analysis of ca from 1982 to 2010 and ndep data from 1982 to 2013 demonstrated that nearly all the 0 05 0 05 pixels in the study area had a significant upward trend p 0 05 therefore the annual value data of ca and ndep in all the 0 05 0 05 pixels were extended to 2015 using the ordinary least squares ols method fig a1 shows the annual dynamics and the extension results of the regional averages of the two types of data specifically ndep data prior to 1990 were filled with ndep data for 1990 while ndep data for 1991 1997 were filled with ndep data for 1997 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 technical route the responses of the spatial patterns and annual variation trends of wue to the environmental factors were explored through two paths respectively the first was to obtain the spatial patterns of the 34 year averages of the annual wue wue and other environmental variables ta pr sr ca and ndep from 1982 to 2015 for each 0 05 0 05 grid of the study region and then to perform an attribution analysis with an xml model xmlm similarly the other path was to obtain the trend slopes of the annual variation in wue swue and the other environmental variables sta spr ssr sca and sndep for every 0 05 0 05 sample grid in the study area over the past 34 years and then to perform an attribution analysis with another xml model xmls specifically since our trend analysis is based on spatial data each spatial raster represents a different ecosystem thus the spatial heterogeneity of the wue magnitudes likely plays a role in the spatial heterogeneity of the swue trend therefore wue was also adopted to participate in xmls to model swue the technical scheme is shown in fig 1 the multi year trend slopes of the annual variations of all the elements considered in this study were derived through the theil sen median trend estimation method and were then tested by the mann kendall trend test method the significance level was assessed at p 0 05 because the trend slopes determine the reliability of the trend analysis samples with significant trend slopes of swue p 0 05 were screened out and qualified to participate in the xmls model for attribution the attribution analyses were based on the xml models in this study a complete xml model consisted of an extreme gradient boosting xgboost model for prediction and a shapley additive explanations shap explainer for interpretation 2 3 2 explainable machine learning generally contemporary inherently interpretable machine models have an inadequate fitting ability due to their frugal designs therefore the combination of a sophisticated machine learning model for prediction and a post hoc explanation model for interpretation is a good choice to achieve xml xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 was chosen as the prediction model based on the consideration that only predictions with high accuracy are meaningful for interpretation the gradient boosting algorithm is the basis of xgboost it minimizes deviation and underfitting by continuously establishing estimators in an orderly way which has the irresistible advantage of achieving outstanding accuracy in data modelling moreover xgboost is a highly accurate enhancement of gradient boosting and largely pushes the limits of the model performance the computing power and the scalability of gradient boosting for example in addition to pursuing residual minimization xgboost includes embedded overfitting reduction techniques to ensure model robustness to date xgboost has been applied in many fields to conduct various tasks such as regression classification and ranking detailed descriptions of the algorithm can be found in the publication by chen and guestrin 2016 and the model training process is described in appendix a shap s m lundberg and lee 2017 one of the most popular high fidelity machine learning interpretation techniques available today was chosen as the interpretation technique shap has two main theoretical advantages the first of which is its additive interpretation strategy for a single prediction it achieves interpretability by quantifying the importance of each feature specifically when shap begins to interpret a predictive model it first obtains the base value of the model which is calculated as the average of all predicted values and indicates the value that the model would have predicted if no knowledge of the features was provided subsequently shap decomposes the difference between the base and predicted values into the importance of each input feature this addictive strategy is specified in eq 1 it unifies six other machine learning additive interpretation methods including lime deeplift and layer wise relevance propagation the second advantage of shap is the theoretical basis behind it namely the shap value the shap value inspired by the concept of the shapley value in the field of game theory shapley 1953 is defined as the feature importance under the shap framework the shap value calculates the average of the marginal gains for a feature in all combinations of feature inputs as specified in eq 2 the developers of shap proposed that the shap value could act as a unified measure of feature importance as it maintains three desirable properties local accuracy missingness tolerance and consistency scott m lundberg et al 2018 s m lundberg and lee 2017 specifically local accuracy indicates the addictive strategy and missingness tolerance indicates that the features that are already missing have no impact consistency indicates that when the machine learning model is changed and the marginal contribution of a feature thus increases or remains constant the shap value will increase or remain constant 1 g z φ 0 i 1 m φ i z i 2 φ i s n i s m s 1 m f x s i f x s where g is the explanation model φ 0 is the average of the prediction and φ i r is the feature attribution for feature i namely the shap value moreover z 0 1 m is the coalition vector m is the number of input features n is the set of all input features s is the set of non zero indexes and f x is the expected value of the function conditioned on a subset of the input features 2 3 3 statistical analysis further statistical analyses were conducted based on the shap results first to evaluate the total influence force of each factor that drives wue variation the factor importance index for a specific factor was defined as the average of its absolute shap values obtained on all valid spots over the study region eq 3 furthermore to evaluate the dominant range of each factor for a specific spot the driving factor with the largest shap absolute value was defined as the dominant driving factor eq 4 finally the dependencies between the values of each factor and its corresponding shap values for all samples were plotted to explore the individualized influence of each driving factor on the wue outputs along their gradients 3 f i mean k 1 2 n φ i k 4 φ prim max i 1 2 m φ i where f i refers to the factor importance of feature i φ prim indicates the primary factor for a single sample n is the number of all valid samples across the study region and m is the number of input features for a single sample 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of wue and its drivers the regional average of the 34 year averaged wue in china was estimated to be 1 30 0 95 g c m 2 mm 1 yr 1 after excluding the extreme values which is consistent with previous studies such as bai et al 2020 which suggested that the average growing season wue at the 31 sites over china was 1 67 0 98 g c kg 1 h2o the estimated wue exhibited a discernible heterogeneity in its geographic distribution across china fig 2 a wue was found to have low values in the northwestern and qinghai tibet regions and higher values in the northeastern and southern regions with the highest values in kunming sichuan and taiwan provinces and the southernmost part of tibet province the spatial distributions of the theil sen based trend slopes of the annual wue swue are illustrated in fig 2 b wue was found to have a positive growth trend in most regions areas with a strong positive trend of wue were found to be mainly distributed in the yellow river basin in north china the xinjiang uygur autonomous region in northwest china and a few southern regions conversely areas with a negative swue trend were sparsely distributed in the northernmost part of north china and a few southern areas among which a strong decreasing trend was found in taiwan province the spatial distribution of the environmental factors concerned are mapped in fig 3 3 2 attribution of the spatial variations and trends in wue the effects of the environmental factors on the multi year averages and annual trends of wue were explored via two xml models both models achieved good performance and were qualified for conducting an explanation analysis the evaluations of the modeled wue and swue are presented in table a1 and fig a2 the shap values for each factor in the study area were further obtained fig 4 the shap explainers delivered a base value of 1 3 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 for the spatial pattern attribution and 0 012 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 for the annual trend attribution for each 0 05 0 05 sample the sum of the shap base value and the shap values obtained by all variables was the modeled value from the xgboost model a summary of the shap values obtained by each factor is shown in fig 5 3 2 1 attribution of the spatial variation in wue according to the spatial distribution of the shap values obtained for each factor ta and ndep were found to contribute positively to the wue gains while ca contributed negatively in most of the study area both pr and sr were found to have comparable positive and negative shap values their absolute shap values however were relatively larger and their spatial patterns in the study area were also more evident fig 4 a the spatial variation in wue was found to be largely determined by climatic factors more specifically by pr rather than by ca and ndep both in terms of the force and the dominant space fig 6 a1 a2 pr was found to have a dominant impact on the spatial variation of wue its importance index was 0 52 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 which is much higher than that of the secondary factor pr was found to be the primary factor in 74 1 of the study region covering most of northwest northern and southern china sr the secondary factor that was found to drive the spatial variation in wue had a feature importance index of 0 26 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and acted as the dominant factor in 18 1 of the study region which is mainly distributed in the qinghai tibet regions and some of northeast china ca ta and ndep were found to have similar importance indexes of about 0 13 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 ca played a dominant role in about 4 5 of the study area a continuous strip like area that covers beijing tianjin shanghai and hebei as well as parts of shanxi and shaanxi ningxia and gansu provinces the sites dominated by ta and ndep respectively accounted for only 2 3 and 1 0 of the whole study area and they were sparsely distributed across the study area the dependence plots of the factors and their shap values are mapped in fig 7 a which also exhibits the polynomial curves fitted by the ols method overall in the spatial pattern the response of wue to pr was found to be positive as the shap value of pr increased along the increasing gradient of pr fig 7 a5 an obvious threshold appeared at 500 mm where the direction of the effect of pr on wue shifted from negative to positive moreover after pr reached about 1000 mm the response of wue began to stabilize regarding the remaining four factors wue was found to monotonically respond to ta and ca as lower ta and higher ca values produced higher wue gains fig 7 a1 a3 in contrast wue non monotonically responded to sr and ndep as the shap values increased and then decreased along their gradients fig 7 a2 a4 3 2 2 attribution of the spatial variation in swue as seen in figs 5 b and 6 b since wue was found to have the highest importance index of 0 006 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and acted as the dominant factor in 55 of the sample spots the spatial pattern of wue determined the spatial pattern of annual variation trend in wue sndep and sca were also found to play an important role with their importance indexes of about 0 004 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and 0 0034 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and their dominant space covering 23 37 and 15 69 of the valid sample spots respectively the variation of ssr seemed to exert a relatively minor effect on the spatial variation in swue as it had its importance index of 0 0022 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and acted as the dominant factor in about 4 63 of the study areas where swue was significant the variation of spr and sta was found to exert a negligible effect on the spatial variation in swue as spr and sta had their low importance indexes of 0 0013 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and 0 001 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and both acted as the dominant factor in only about 0 6 of the study areas where swue was significant the places dominated by wue are mainly some arid and semi arid areas such as northwest and north china and the northern part of southwest china the places dominated by sndep are mainly some relatively humid areas such as central china south china east china and the southern part of southwest china the places dominated by the other factors were all found to be sparsely distributed fig 6 b2 the dependence plots of the factors their shap values and the polynomial curves used to smooth the series are mapped in fig 7 b the response of swue to sca was non monotonic fig 7 b1 sca exhibited a strip shaped distribution along the latitude which caused the shap values corresponding to the same gradient of sca to be more dispersed in the shap dependence plot and to have larger uncertainty however there was a jump discontinuity point of sca in the shap dependence graph of swue to sca swue and sca showed negative correlations on both sides of this discontinuity point fig 7 b1 the sca discontinuity point value was about 1 7 ppm yr 1 and its isoline line is located at 42 n in china fig 3 b1 when sndep is negative sndep enhancement seems to have little effect on swue however when sndep is positive sndep growth facilitated swue decline until sndep exceeded about 110 mg n m 2 yr 1 at which point its growth shifted to promote swue growth fig 7 b2 swue exhibited nearly monotonic responses to ssr i e generally higher ssr values produced higher swue losses fig 7 b4 along the factor gradient the shap curves of swue responding to sta and spr similarly showed a positive correlation when the factor is small especially when the factor value is negative and shifted to a large negative correlation when sta reached about 0 077 k yr 1 and spr reached about 0 mm yr 1 fig 7 b3 b5 swue responded to wue non monotonically i e the shap values first increased and then decreased along the wue gradients with the threshold being 1 9 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 fig 7 b6 according to the density estimation for more samples swue responded positively to wue sndep and sta but negatively to sca ssr and spr fig 7 b 4 discussion 4 1 wue response to ca the shap result of ca suggests that elevated ca promotes ecosystem wue fig 7 a1 previous studies have adequately validated this general fact both globally and regionally adams et al 2021 m huang et al 2015 hutley et al 2022 zhou et al 2017 at the plant scale wue is expressed as the ratio of maximum photosynthetic capacity amax to stomatal conductance gs many free air co2 enrichment experiments have revealed an elevated ca induced decrease of both amax and gs however the suppression in amax is much less than that of gs mccarroll et al 2009 richard j norby and zak 2011 walker et al 2021 at the ecosystem scale similarly it is widely supposed that the increase in wue is mainly the result of an extensive ca induced decrease in gs however recent studies based on 30 year tree ring records of carbon and oxygen isotope measurements have challenged the hypothesis and instead suggested that the ca driven increase in photosynthesis is the main cause guerrieri et al 2019 mathias and thomas 2021 however the positive gain of wue driven by ca is not infinite with the increase of the growth rate of ca this positive effect on wue growth gradually diminishes our shap results show that although sca and swue had different spatial relationships in china at higher latitudes and low to mid latitudes both exhibit negative correlations fig 7 b1 this is consistent with a recent study in which adams et al 2020 collected global tree ring isotopic data and detected a gradual decrease in the degree to which ca enhances wue this phenomenon mainly depends on the ca driven increase in vegetation productivity many satellite observations indicate a global decline in the co2 fertilization effect s wang et al 2020 and numerous clues point to the increased nutrient restriction craine et al 2018 terrer et al 2019 s wang et al 2020 as well as considerations of water restriction s wang et al 2020 craine et al 2018 suggested that the global nutrition decline is attributed to the elevated ca and extended vegetation growing seasons due to climate change rather than ndep concerning ca the mechanism behind this may be the decreasing nutrient availability induced by elevated ca which accelerates the transfer of soil n to the plant bodies drake et al 2011 finzi et al 2006 at the plant scale carbon assimilation depends largely on nutrient support adams et al 2019 anderegg et al 2018 y yang et al 2016 in any case high ca growth is detrimental to wue and vegetation productivity thus the positive effect of ca on ecosystem wue should be vigilantly discounted if the ca growth rate continues to increase in the future 4 2 wue response to ndep the spatial distributions of ndep and sndep were similar and the shap dependency graphs of wue to ndep and swue to sndep exhibited similar dynamics that is ndep and sndep experienced stages of growth decline and re growth as the gradient of the factor rises the isolines of ndep and sndep thresholds for these three stages can be identified in fig 3 a2 and b2 in line with the different responses of wue to ndep the study area can be divided into three regions consistent with the spatial distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation in china according to du et al 2020 the western part of china is mainly limited by nitrogen the southeastern part is mainly limited by phosphorus while the northern part of east china which has the peaks of ndep and sndep fig 3 b2 is not considered to be subject to nutrient limitation n limitation constrains both the carbon assimilation function and transpiration but the constraint on carbon assimilation is greater r j norby et al 2017 zavisic et al 2018 and thus increasing nitrogen deposition rate is beneficial to improving carbon assimilation therefore for the western regions of china where vegetation is dominated by nitrogen limitation and the northern part of east china where vegetation is not limited by nutrients increasing ndep had a promoting effect on wue the effect of the gain of ndep on wue however was found to be limited in our study for the southeastern region of china where phosphorus limitation is dominant ndep and sndep were relatively large however there was a negative correlation between wue and ndep fig 3 a2 b2 fig 4 a2 b2 and fig 7 a2 b2 first in these ndep hotspot regions such as southeastern china the impact of ndep on wue mainly depends on its impact on gpp lu et al 2019 additionally a recent study based on a meta analysis found that the gpp gains promoted by global warming would attenuate or even disappear when n is relaxed liu et al 2022 more evidence has also shown that the effects of ndep are generally the greatest at relatively low rates for a range of ecosystems de schrijver et al 2011 wooliver et al 2019 moreover the effect of n on the vegetation in different ecosystems concerns not only its accumulation but also its distribution and stoichiometry rastetter et al 2022 apart from n limitation even phosphorus p limited vegetation may be affected by ndep as n p imbalance also constrains the physiological activity of vegetation y sun et al 2022 therefore long term ndep may exacerbate p limitation and reduce the projected increase in carbon stocks due to the effect of elevated ca on p limited soils z huang et al 2016 which may be the main reason for the negative response of wue to ndep in the southeastern region of china although changes in ndep were found to have little effect on wue fig 6 a1 a2 the spatial distribution of sndep was found to play an important role in the spatial distribution of swue indicating that nutrient limitation is an important factor for wue trend thus under the strong changing dynamics of ndep in china to achieve the overall optimal scheme for wue promotion it is necessary to study their response relationship separately according to the different nutrient limitations on the local vegetation 4 3 wue response to climatic factors many previous studies bai et al 2020 q zhu et al 2011 x j zhu et al 2015 based on ec derived wue data reported consistent conclusions regarding the positive relationship between wue and pr and that between wue and ta however this is contrary to s sun et al 2018 who reported a negative correlation between the spatially averaged annual wue and the annual mean values of ta and p in china using a process based model s sun et al 2018 explained that this discrepancy results from the difference between site based data and integrated regional values the shap results in the present study based on integrated regional data however suggest inconsistent conclusions on wue responses as compared to previous studies regarding pr a linear relationship with wue was found as high wue values were accompanied by high pr values in terms of the spatial pattern fig 3 a5 fig 4 a5 fig 7 a5 highly productive vegetation is accompanied by a water rich environment e g its stomatal conductance as affected by evolved anatomical morphological or physiological characteristics is much less constrained adams et al 2021 and its wue is less constrained by water the effect is contrary for water constrained vegetation therefore pr which shows a side of the richness of the local water resources played a significant role in shaping the spatial pattern of wue q zhu et al 2011 in this case wue was found to respond linearly to pr however the shap results seem more conservative in terms of their multi year trend as locations with a stable trend in annual pr spr 0 mm yr 1 were found to make the largest positive contributions to swue fig 7 b5 and these locations occupied the largest area of the study area areas with large absolute values of spr are mainly concentrated in taiwan in east china and the qinghai tibet alpine zone in southwest china where spr had a relatively large negative contribution to swue fig 3 b5 fig 4 b5 for the arid and semi arid alpine regions the limited water resources may cause a positive response of swue to spr as for the humid east china region where vegetation productivity is less limited by water higher pr increase may intensify local evaporation or increase water overload resulting in a decrease in wue regarding the spatial pattern of wue the shap results of xmlm indicated that ta and wue were negatively correlated fig 7 a3 consistent bai et al 2020 s sun et al 2018 or contradictory x j zhu et al 2015 results have been found in previous studies the response of wue to ta is different in different ecosystems due to the different responses of gpp and et to ta x j zhu et al 2015 suggested that the distribution of ta in china is closely related to the distribution of the lai and that ta may indirectly affect wue by influencing the lai due to the larger lai in warmer regions bai et al 2020 suggested that ta may also affect wue by directly influencing vapor pressure deficit further efforts are needed to explore the mechanism behind the results of the xmlm analysis the xmls shap results showed that the optimal value of sta for swue growth was about 0 077 k yr 1 fig 7 b3 however the sta of most sample points was lower than this value fig 3 b3 and had a positive correlation with swue fig 7 b3 which may indicate that most regions still have room to promote wue gain by increasing ta growth previous studies have found a negative correlation between wue and radiation y li et al 2018 x j zhu et al 2015 this is because the photosynthetic light response curve is usually a non regular rectangular hyperbola xu et al 2019 excessive light however may lead to photoinhibition which is characterized by a decrease in the photosynthetic electron transport rate photooxidative damage decreases in co2 uptake and the accumulation of dry matter demmig adams and adams 2017 in particular for plateaus where there is high radiation and a low co2 concentration the negative response of gpp to radiation is evident fig 3 a4 b4 fig 4 a4 b4 q yu et al 2002 furthermore a recent study suggests that radiation is strongly correlated with transpiration independent of the stomatal conductance mechanism boese et al 2017 moreover radiation driven transpiration enhancement and a radiation stimulated rise in soil evaporation may allow et rather than gpp to exhibit greater sensitivity to sr y li et al 2018 thus at the ecosystem scale it is reasonable that areas in the study region with high sr and ssr values were accompanied by lesser wue and swue gains fig 7 a4 b4 4 4 wue trend response to mean annual wue according to our results the spatial pattern of wue determined the spatial pattern of swue fig 6 b specifically swue responded to wue non monotonically i e the shap values first increased and then decreased along the wue gradients with the threshold being 1 9 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 fig 7 b6 this means that areas with larger wue have limited potential for wue enhancement and these areas are mainly distributed in the eastern region of china fig 2 however for the large areas with lower wue in the western part of china there is still room for improvement in wue fig 2 5 conclusions the factors that drive wue variation are mixed and contrasted across different regions based on two xml models the individualized effects of ca ndep and climatic factors on the spatial and trend variations in wue across china between 1982 and 2015 were disentangled the xml models consisted of an xgboost machine learning model which was used to fit the nonlinear relationship between the response factors and the drivers and a shap explanation model which quantified the effect of each driver on each sample as shap values among the two xml models one xmlm was used to detect the nonlinear relationships between the 34 year averages of the annual values of wue and those of ta sr pr ca and ndep the other model xmls was used to explore the relationships between the trend slopes of the annual variation in wue and the environmental factors further by aggregating the spatial shap values obtained by the two models it was explored how wue responds to the driving factors in terms of the multi year averages and trend changes over the study area statistical analyses based on the xml parsing results were conducted as follows first the factor importance was defined as the mean of all absolute shap values in the space and the dominant factor at each 0 5 degree area was defined as the driving factor with the largest absolute shap value as a result it was found that the mean annual pr played a dominant role in shaping the spatial pattern of wue and the spatial pattern of wue contributed the most to the trend of wue in china over the last three decades moreover the shap values obtained for each factor were plotted along the gradient of the factor magnitude thus allowing for the holistic observation of how the drivers affect the wue the combination of the results of the multi year average and trend analysis reveals the following 1 ca benefits wue gains but the ca driven gains in wue decrease with elevated ca growth rates 2 although spatial variation in ndep has a slight impact on the spatial pattern of wue the change of ndep had a different and significant impact on wue growth in light of different nutrient limitations on the local vegetation 3 among the meteorological factors wue responds negatively to ta and positively to pr spatially and the trends in ta and pr are most favorable for wue growth when they are close to the threshold of 0 077 k yr 1 and 0 mm yr 1 respectively moreover the growth of sr consistently inhibits the growth of wue xml methods exhibit the strong potential to explain the complex relationships between components the machine learning approach enables the exploration of the complex relationships between wue and its drivers moreover the shap explanation framework decomposes the model output of each sample point into the contribution values of each driver thereby allowing for the interpretation of the wue response both globally and locally the main uncertainty arises from the need for more in depth descriptions of the different ecosystems in the aggregated analysis based on spatial data further this uncertainty may be amplified by local accuracy one of the essential properties of shap regardless xml was employed to provide valuable information from another perspective on how wue responds to environmental factors in summary the xml interpretation can improve the understanding of wue variation 6 data availability statement the gpp

emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief the responses of ecosystem water use efficiency wue to environmental perturbations are non linearly dependent on how strongly coupled are water and carbon cycling here we evaluate the structure of these non linearities using two high fidelity explainable machine learning xml models to disentangle the confounding effects of the air temperature ta precipitation pr downward shortwave radiation sr atmospheric co2 concentration ca and nitrogen deposition ndep on wue the findings suggest that mean annual pr plays a dominant role in shaping the spatial pattern of wue spatially wue responded positively to pr and ca but negatively to ta and sr while ndep had little impact on wue for temporal trends the spatial pattern of the mean annual wue determined the spatial pattern of the wue trend furthermore the spatial patterns of the ndep and ca trends also contributed substantially to the spatial pattern of the wue trend notably the wue and ca trends exhibited negative correlations while the wue and ndep trends showed positive or negative correlations depending on the different nutrient constraints on vegetation the wue growth rate responded negatively to sr in both spatial patterns and temporal trends additionally using the trend of 0 077 k yr 1 and 0 mm yr 1 as the threshold the trends of ta and pr shifted from positive to negative relationships on wue growth our results help identify key sensitivities and thresholds in wue to environmental controls over space and time keywords water use efficiency ecosystem climate change machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial ecosystem water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity gpp to evapotranspiration et represents the trade off between carbon sequestration and water consumption at the ecosystem scale cooley et al 2022 m huang et al 2015 wue reflects the coupling of the regional and global carbon and water cycles and the adaptability of vegetation in different ecosystems and various periods therefore understanding the spatiotemporal changes in the responses of wue to environmental forces is important for making reliable projections of future carbon water coupling to date many studies have shown that the global temporal increase of wue is primarily driven by variations in atmospheric co2 concentration ca and nitrogen deposition ndep b el masri et al 2019 bassil el masri et al 2021 m huang et al 2015 traore et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 and climatic factors are considered to increase zhou et al 2017 or decrease wue b el masri et al 2019 however at the regional or local scale the responses of wue to these variables remain unclear because different ecosystems have distinct characteristics associated with species composition and plant function types the exchanges of water and carbon fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere vary temporally and geographically cooley et al 2022 nemani et al 2003 ponton et al 2006 resulting in contrasting responses of wue to environmental drivers regional analysis is therefore imperative to clarify the spatial and temporal responses of wue to potential drivers to gain a targeted understanding of local c h2o coupling relationships in the context of climate change in the past three decades climatic conditions have significantly shifted and both ca and ndep have increased significantly particularly in china with industrial development guirui yu et al 2019 as a result many studies have sought to examine the spatial and temporal variations of wue with these factors in china bai et al 2020 g li et al 2021 s sun et al 2018 g yu et al 2008 q zhu et al 2011 x j zhu et al 2015 ca and ndep have been identified as the primary drivers of the global wue increase over the last three decades based on multiple process based models b el masri et al 2019 m huang et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 however regionally the dominant factors of wue must still be determined via individual analyses although it is generally accepted that wue increases with ca walker et al 2021 the level of the wue response to increases in ca remains unclear b el masri et al 2019 and involves a debate on the aggravated nutrient limitation induced by increasing ca giguère croteau et al 2019 van der sleen et al 2015 moreover although the increased addition of ndep will promote photosynthesis terrer et al 2019 y p wang et al 2010 because china s terrestrial vegetation generally suffers from the limitation of nutrient availability du et al 2020 joshua b fisher et al 2012 shao et al 2016 a recent meta analysis showed that nitrogen n addition might not further benefit plant growth when nitrogen limitation is relieved liu et al 2022 in addition high levels of ndep were identified as the dominant factor driving the decline in leaf c n ratio in southern china sheng et al 2021 while the increase in c n ratio is an important mechanism for carbon gains in most vegetation rastetter et al 2022 therefore based on the uncertainty of the different effects of ca and ndep on wue it is necessary to unravel the distinct responses of wue to the trajectories of ca and ndep in various biomes and ecosystems apart from the responses to ca and ndep the role of climatic factors on wue must be explored as contrasting responses of wue to climatic factors including air temperature ta downward shortwave radiation sr and precipitation pr have been observed in previous studies for example s sun et al 2018 and g yu et al 2008 reported that the annual wue decreased with pr and ta while x j zhu et al 2015 suggested that it logarithmically varied with pr and linearly increased with ta in china g li et al 2021 found that wue was positively correlated with ta and p in 50 21 and 66 16 of the areas in china respectively in a global analysis however xue et al 2015 indicated that in most regions wue is positively correlated with pr and specific humidity and negatively correlated with ta and sr the spatial distribution patterns of wue observed in previous studies have also varied for instance bai et al 2020 suggested that wue has higher values in forests and cropland than in shrubland and grassland in china while g li et al 2021 suggested that it has greater values in woodland than in non woodland along the aridity gradient bai et al 2020 found that the value of wue is decreased in arid dry sub humid and semi arid areas in china while ponce campos et al 2013 and tian et al 2010 suggested that wue decreases with the moisture availability these inconsistent conclusions may result from the differences in multi source and multi scale data attribution methods and various study regions making it necessary to prudently assess the response of wue to various climatic variables at the regional scale thus there remains a need to continue studying how wue has responded to the environmental factors in the last three decades across china not only because of the inconsistent conclusions but also because of the necessity to improve the understanding of ecosystem processes and feedback to the climate system as the magnitude and amplitude of climate change continue to expand globally the present study aimed to examine 1 how the spatial variations of environmental variables affect the spatial pattern of wue and 2 how the changes of climatic variables ca and ndep influence the regional trends of wue distinct from existing studies the confounding effects of all the drivers were disentangled and their individualized effects on wue were investigated along the gradients of each variable to this end two explainable machine learning xml models were employed to explore the complicated relationships between wue and its drivers in spatial and temporal terms respectively most current studies on wue in china have been based on observational data and have employed simple unary linear regression for the attribution analysis of environmental factors bai et al 2020 ponce campos et al 2013 xue et al 2015 x j zhu et al 2015 however this traditional unary linear regression distorts the nonlinear relationships between wue and its drivers ignoring the interaction and coupling effects between drivers therefore there are clear advantages to using xml methods to understand better the underlying mechanisms of the relationships between physical quantities and their drivers gevaert 2022 on the one hand complex machine learning methods have high predictive performance in identifying the linear nonlinear relationships between physical quantities thus allowing for exploiting the maximum potential in mining data relationships on the other hand the explanatory ability of xml can manifest the data relationships fitted by machine learning thus enabling the further mining of new knowledge such as the identification of the dominant factors of physical quantities lipton 2016 the visualization of their nonlinear effects and the quantification of the magnitudes of these effects montavon et al 2018 roscher et al 2020 roscher et al 2020 thus in this study xml was employed to obtain the contributions of environmental factors to wue and more importantly to determine how these features contribute to wue 2 materials and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 data sources gpp and et data were collected from two independent data products to calculate wue selected by a combination of multi decadal availability resolution and linkage to observations first gpp data were derived from the global land surface satellite glass product the glass gpp is driven by the eddy covariance light use efficiency ec lue model which is based on eddy covariance data and light utilization efficiency theory wenping yuan et al 2010 wenping yuan et al 2007 the latest version of the glass gpp product integrates the forces of ca radiative composition and atmospheric water vapor pressure to accurately indicate long term changes in gpp w yuan et al 2019 the et data were derived from ma et al 2019b the data comprise the terrestrial monthly actual et dataset across china with a spatial resolution of 0 1 these estimates of et in the dataset were derived by the complementary relationship method which is entirely based on atmospheric data and requires no information on vegetation and soil parameters ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2019a meteorological data were sourced from a near surface meteorological and environmental reanalysis dataset namely the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 k yang and he 2019 which has a 0 1 degree spatial resolution and a 3 h temporal resolution three meteorological elements were adopted from the cmfd dataset including the 2 m ta the surface sr and the pr rate to characterize the variation of climatic conditions the accuracy of this dataset is between those of meteorological station observations and satellite derived data as its development was based on remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ observation data from weather stations its characteristics of a long available length high resolution stability and continuity make it preferable to china s meteorological datasets moreover the cmfd data were also the basic atmospheric inputs for the et data adopted in this study therefore they had good coherence with the et data the ca data were derived from a global 0 5 degree model forcing dataset provided by the multi scale synthesis and terrestrial model intercomparison project mstmip wei et al 2014a the mstmip global simulation project is a formal synthesis activity and model intercomparison and evaluation project aimed at improving the diagnosis and attribution of carbon exchange at the local and global scales j b fisher et al 2022 huntzinger et al 2013 the environmental driver data of mstmip is a standardized set of driven data fused from multiple data sources among which the ca data prepared for the mstmip are consistent with the globalview co2 2011 data product and time series of historic ca from multiple observation sites more detailed information about the mstmip has been described in previous studies huntzinger et al 2013 wei et al 2014b moreover the ndep data were obtained from a dataset that was developed from the in site ndep data across china and further quantified by a global aerosol chemical climate model gao et al 2020a gao et al 2020b the dataset combines dry and wet depositions including all forms of nitrogen the attributions of the data products are tabulated in table 1 2 2 data processing all data were reprojected to the world geodetic system 1984 and resampled to a 0 05 0 05 spatial resolution using the bilinear resampling method to study the annual dynamics of wue all data were aggregated into annual averages except for pr and evaporation and thus wue which were resampled to annual total values the ca and ndep data were also used in terms of their annual total amounts the theil sen median and mann kendall trend analysis of ca from 1982 to 2010 and ndep data from 1982 to 2013 demonstrated that nearly all the 0 05 0 05 pixels in the study area had a significant upward trend p 0 05 therefore the annual value data of ca and ndep in all the 0 05 0 05 pixels were extended to 2015 using the ordinary least squares ols method fig a1 shows the annual dynamics and the extension results of the regional averages of the two types of data specifically ndep data prior to 1990 were filled with ndep data for 1990 while ndep data for 1991 1997 were filled with ndep data for 1997 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 technical route the responses of the spatial patterns and annual variation trends of wue to the environmental factors were explored through two paths respectively the first was to obtain the spatial patterns of the 34 year averages of the annual wue wue and other environmental variables ta pr sr ca and ndep from 1982 to 2015 for each 0 05 0 05 grid of the study region and then to perform an attribution analysis with an xml model xmlm similarly the other path was to obtain the trend slopes of the annual variation in wue swue and the other environmental variables sta spr ssr sca and sndep for every 0 05 0 05 sample grid in the study area over the past 34 years and then to perform an attribution analysis with another xml model xmls specifically since our trend analysis is based on spatial data each spatial raster represents a different ecosystem thus the spatial heterogeneity of the wue magnitudes likely plays a role in the spatial heterogeneity of the swue trend therefore wue was also adopted to participate in xmls to model swue the technical scheme is shown in fig 1 the multi year trend slopes of the annual variations of all the elements considered in this study were derived through the theil sen median trend estimation method and were then tested by the mann kendall trend test method the significance level was assessed at p 0 05 because the trend slopes determine the reliability of the trend analysis samples with significant trend slopes of swue p 0 05 were screened out and qualified to participate in the xmls model for attribution the attribution analyses were based on the xml models in this study a complete xml model consisted of an extreme gradient boosting xgboost model for prediction and a shapley additive explanations shap explainer for interpretation 2 3 2 explainable machine learning generally contemporary inherently interpretable machine models have an inadequate fitting ability due to their frugal designs therefore the combination of a sophisticated machine learning model for prediction and a post hoc explanation model for interpretation is a good choice to achieve xml xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 was chosen as the prediction model based on the consideration that only predictions with high accuracy are meaningful for interpretation the gradient boosting algorithm is the basis of xgboost it minimizes deviation and underfitting by continuously establishing estimators in an orderly way which has the irresistible advantage of achieving outstanding accuracy in data modelling moreover xgboost is a highly accurate enhancement of gradient boosting and largely pushes the limits of the model performance the computing power and the scalability of gradient boosting for example in addition to pursuing residual minimization xgboost includes embedded overfitting reduction techniques to ensure model robustness to date xgboost has been applied in many fields to conduct various tasks such as regression classification and ranking detailed descriptions of the algorithm can be found in the publication by chen and guestrin 2016 and the model training process is described in appendix a shap s m lundberg and lee 2017 one of the most popular high fidelity machine learning interpretation techniques available today was chosen as the interpretation technique shap has two main theoretical advantages the first of which is its additive interpretation strategy for a single prediction it achieves interpretability by quantifying the importance of each feature specifically when shap begins to interpret a predictive model it first obtains the base value of the model which is calculated as the average of all predicted values and indicates the value that the model would have predicted if no knowledge of the features was provided subsequently shap decomposes the difference between the base and predicted values into the importance of each input feature this addictive strategy is specified in eq 1 it unifies six other machine learning additive interpretation methods including lime deeplift and layer wise relevance propagation the second advantage of shap is the theoretical basis behind it namely the shap value the shap value inspired by the concept of the shapley value in the field of game theory shapley 1953 is defined as the feature importance under the shap framework the shap value calculates the average of the marginal gains for a feature in all combinations of feature inputs as specified in eq 2 the developers of shap proposed that the shap value could act as a unified measure of feature importance as it maintains three desirable properties local accuracy missingness tolerance and consistency scott m lundberg et al 2018 s m lundberg and lee 2017 specifically local accuracy indicates the addictive strategy and missingness tolerance indicates that the features that are already missing have no impact consistency indicates that when the machine learning model is changed and the marginal contribution of a feature thus increases or remains constant the shap value will increase or remain constant 1 g z φ 0 i 1 m φ i z i 2 φ i s n i s m s 1 m f x s i f x s where g is the explanation model φ 0 is the average of the prediction and φ i r is the feature attribution for feature i namely the shap value moreover z 0 1 m is the coalition vector m is the number of input features n is the set of all input features s is the set of non zero indexes and f x is the expected value of the function conditioned on a subset of the input features 2 3 3 statistical analysis further statistical analyses were conducted based on the shap results first to evaluate the total influence force of each factor that drives wue variation the factor importance index for a specific factor was defined as the average of its absolute shap values obtained on all valid spots over the study region eq 3 furthermore to evaluate the dominant range of each factor for a specific spot the driving factor with the largest shap absolute value was defined as the dominant driving factor eq 4 finally the dependencies between the values of each factor and its corresponding shap values for all samples were plotted to explore the individualized influence of each driving factor on the wue outputs along their gradients 3 f i mean k 1 2 n φ i k 4 φ prim max i 1 2 m φ i where f i refers to the factor importance of feature i φ prim indicates the primary factor for a single sample n is the number of all valid samples across the study region and m is the number of input features for a single sample 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal dynamics of wue and its drivers the regional average of the 34 year averaged wue in china was estimated to be 1 30 0 95 g c m 2 mm 1 yr 1 after excluding the extreme values which is consistent with previous studies such as bai et al 2020 which suggested that the average growing season wue at the 31 sites over china was 1 67 0 98 g c kg 1 h2o the estimated wue exhibited a discernible heterogeneity in its geographic distribution across china fig 2 a wue was found to have low values in the northwestern and qinghai tibet regions and higher values in the northeastern and southern regions with the highest values in kunming sichuan and taiwan provinces and the southernmost part of tibet province the spatial distributions of the theil sen based trend slopes of the annual wue swue are illustrated in fig 2 b wue was found to have a positive growth trend in most regions areas with a strong positive trend of wue were found to be mainly distributed in the yellow river basin in north china the xinjiang uygur autonomous region in northwest china and a few southern regions conversely areas with a negative swue trend were sparsely distributed in the northernmost part of north china and a few southern areas among which a strong decreasing trend was found in taiwan province the spatial distribution of the environmental factors concerned are mapped in fig 3 3 2 attribution of the spatial variations and trends in wue the effects of the environmental factors on the multi year averages and annual trends of wue were explored via two xml models both models achieved good performance and were qualified for conducting an explanation analysis the evaluations of the modeled wue and swue are presented in table a1 and fig a2 the shap values for each factor in the study area were further obtained fig 4 the shap explainers delivered a base value of 1 3 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 for the spatial pattern attribution and 0 012 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 for the annual trend attribution for each 0 05 0 05 sample the sum of the shap base value and the shap values obtained by all variables was the modeled value from the xgboost model a summary of the shap values obtained by each factor is shown in fig 5 3 2 1 attribution of the spatial variation in wue according to the spatial distribution of the shap values obtained for each factor ta and ndep were found to contribute positively to the wue gains while ca contributed negatively in most of the study area both pr and sr were found to have comparable positive and negative shap values their absolute shap values however were relatively larger and their spatial patterns in the study area were also more evident fig 4 a the spatial variation in wue was found to be largely determined by climatic factors more specifically by pr rather than by ca and ndep both in terms of the force and the dominant space fig 6 a1 a2 pr was found to have a dominant impact on the spatial variation of wue its importance index was 0 52 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 which is much higher than that of the secondary factor pr was found to be the primary factor in 74 1 of the study region covering most of northwest northern and southern china sr the secondary factor that was found to drive the spatial variation in wue had a feature importance index of 0 26 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and acted as the dominant factor in 18 1 of the study region which is mainly distributed in the qinghai tibet regions and some of northeast china ca ta and ndep were found to have similar importance indexes of about 0 13 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 ca played a dominant role in about 4 5 of the study area a continuous strip like area that covers beijing tianjin shanghai and hebei as well as parts of shanxi and shaanxi ningxia and gansu provinces the sites dominated by ta and ndep respectively accounted for only 2 3 and 1 0 of the whole study area and they were sparsely distributed across the study area the dependence plots of the factors and their shap values are mapped in fig 7 a which also exhibits the polynomial curves fitted by the ols method overall in the spatial pattern the response of wue to pr was found to be positive as the shap value of pr increased along the increasing gradient of pr fig 7 a5 an obvious threshold appeared at 500 mm where the direction of the effect of pr on wue shifted from negative to positive moreover after pr reached about 1000 mm the response of wue began to stabilize regarding the remaining four factors wue was found to monotonically respond to ta and ca as lower ta and higher ca values produced higher wue gains fig 7 a1 a3 in contrast wue non monotonically responded to sr and ndep as the shap values increased and then decreased along their gradients fig 7 a2 a4 3 2 2 attribution of the spatial variation in swue as seen in figs 5 b and 6 b since wue was found to have the highest importance index of 0 006 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and acted as the dominant factor in 55 of the sample spots the spatial pattern of wue determined the spatial pattern of annual variation trend in wue sndep and sca were also found to play an important role with their importance indexes of about 0 004 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and 0 0034 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and their dominant space covering 23 37 and 15 69 of the valid sample spots respectively the variation of ssr seemed to exert a relatively minor effect on the spatial variation in swue as it had its importance index of 0 0022 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and acted as the dominant factor in about 4 63 of the study areas where swue was significant the variation of spr and sta was found to exert a negligible effect on the spatial variation in swue as spr and sta had their low importance indexes of 0 0013 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and 0 001 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 and both acted as the dominant factor in only about 0 6 of the study areas where swue was significant the places dominated by wue are mainly some arid and semi arid areas such as northwest and north china and the northern part of southwest china the places dominated by sndep are mainly some relatively humid areas such as central china south china east china and the southern part of southwest china the places dominated by the other factors were all found to be sparsely distributed fig 6 b2 the dependence plots of the factors their shap values and the polynomial curves used to smooth the series are mapped in fig 7 b the response of swue to sca was non monotonic fig 7 b1 sca exhibited a strip shaped distribution along the latitude which caused the shap values corresponding to the same gradient of sca to be more dispersed in the shap dependence plot and to have larger uncertainty however there was a jump discontinuity point of sca in the shap dependence graph of swue to sca swue and sca showed negative correlations on both sides of this discontinuity point fig 7 b1 the sca discontinuity point value was about 1 7 ppm yr 1 and its isoline line is located at 42 n in china fig 3 b1 when sndep is negative sndep enhancement seems to have little effect on swue however when sndep is positive sndep growth facilitated swue decline until sndep exceeded about 110 mg n m 2 yr 1 at which point its growth shifted to promote swue growth fig 7 b2 swue exhibited nearly monotonic responses to ssr i e generally higher ssr values produced higher swue losses fig 7 b4 along the factor gradient the shap curves of swue responding to sta and spr similarly showed a positive correlation when the factor is small especially when the factor value is negative and shifted to a large negative correlation when sta reached about 0 077 k yr 1 and spr reached about 0 mm yr 1 fig 7 b3 b5 swue responded to wue non monotonically i e the shap values first increased and then decreased along the wue gradients with the threshold being 1 9 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 fig 7 b6 according to the density estimation for more samples swue responded positively to wue sndep and sta but negatively to sca ssr and spr fig 7 b 4 discussion 4 1 wue response to ca the shap result of ca suggests that elevated ca promotes ecosystem wue fig 7 a1 previous studies have adequately validated this general fact both globally and regionally adams et al 2021 m huang et al 2015 hutley et al 2022 zhou et al 2017 at the plant scale wue is expressed as the ratio of maximum photosynthetic capacity amax to stomatal conductance gs many free air co2 enrichment experiments have revealed an elevated ca induced decrease of both amax and gs however the suppression in amax is much less than that of gs mccarroll et al 2009 richard j norby and zak 2011 walker et al 2021 at the ecosystem scale similarly it is widely supposed that the increase in wue is mainly the result of an extensive ca induced decrease in gs however recent studies based on 30 year tree ring records of carbon and oxygen isotope measurements have challenged the hypothesis and instead suggested that the ca driven increase in photosynthesis is the main cause guerrieri et al 2019 mathias and thomas 2021 however the positive gain of wue driven by ca is not infinite with the increase of the growth rate of ca this positive effect on wue growth gradually diminishes our shap results show that although sca and swue had different spatial relationships in china at higher latitudes and low to mid latitudes both exhibit negative correlations fig 7 b1 this is consistent with a recent study in which adams et al 2020 collected global tree ring isotopic data and detected a gradual decrease in the degree to which ca enhances wue this phenomenon mainly depends on the ca driven increase in vegetation productivity many satellite observations indicate a global decline in the co2 fertilization effect s wang et al 2020 and numerous clues point to the increased nutrient restriction craine et al 2018 terrer et al 2019 s wang et al 2020 as well as considerations of water restriction s wang et al 2020 craine et al 2018 suggested that the global nutrition decline is attributed to the elevated ca and extended vegetation growing seasons due to climate change rather than ndep concerning ca the mechanism behind this may be the decreasing nutrient availability induced by elevated ca which accelerates the transfer of soil n to the plant bodies drake et al 2011 finzi et al 2006 at the plant scale carbon assimilation depends largely on nutrient support adams et al 2019 anderegg et al 2018 y yang et al 2016 in any case high ca growth is detrimental to wue and vegetation productivity thus the positive effect of ca on ecosystem wue should be vigilantly discounted if the ca growth rate continues to increase in the future 4 2 wue response to ndep the spatial distributions of ndep and sndep were similar and the shap dependency graphs of wue to ndep and swue to sndep exhibited similar dynamics that is ndep and sndep experienced stages of growth decline and re growth as the gradient of the factor rises the isolines of ndep and sndep thresholds for these three stages can be identified in fig 3 a2 and b2 in line with the different responses of wue to ndep the study area can be divided into three regions consistent with the spatial distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation in china according to du et al 2020 the western part of china is mainly limited by nitrogen the southeastern part is mainly limited by phosphorus while the northern part of east china which has the peaks of ndep and sndep fig 3 b2 is not considered to be subject to nutrient limitation n limitation constrains both the carbon assimilation function and transpiration but the constraint on carbon assimilation is greater r j norby et al 2017 zavisic et al 2018 and thus increasing nitrogen deposition rate is beneficial to improving carbon assimilation therefore for the western regions of china where vegetation is dominated by nitrogen limitation and the northern part of east china where vegetation is not limited by nutrients increasing ndep had a promoting effect on wue the effect of the gain of ndep on wue however was found to be limited in our study for the southeastern region of china where phosphorus limitation is dominant ndep and sndep were relatively large however there was a negative correlation between wue and ndep fig 3 a2 b2 fig 4 a2 b2 and fig 7 a2 b2 first in these ndep hotspot regions such as southeastern china the impact of ndep on wue mainly depends on its impact on gpp lu et al 2019 additionally a recent study based on a meta analysis found that the gpp gains promoted by global warming would attenuate or even disappear when n is relaxed liu et al 2022 more evidence has also shown that the effects of ndep are generally the greatest at relatively low rates for a range of ecosystems de schrijver et al 2011 wooliver et al 2019 moreover the effect of n on the vegetation in different ecosystems concerns not only its accumulation but also its distribution and stoichiometry rastetter et al 2022 apart from n limitation even phosphorus p limited vegetation may be affected by ndep as n p imbalance also constrains the physiological activity of vegetation y sun et al 2022 therefore long term ndep may exacerbate p limitation and reduce the projected increase in carbon stocks due to the effect of elevated ca on p limited soils z huang et al 2016 which may be the main reason for the negative response of wue to ndep in the southeastern region of china although changes in ndep were found to have little effect on wue fig 6 a1 a2 the spatial distribution of sndep was found to play an important role in the spatial distribution of swue indicating that nutrient limitation is an important factor for wue trend thus under the strong changing dynamics of ndep in china to achieve the overall optimal scheme for wue promotion it is necessary to study their response relationship separately according to the different nutrient limitations on the local vegetation 4 3 wue response to climatic factors many previous studies bai et al 2020 q zhu et al 2011 x j zhu et al 2015 based on ec derived wue data reported consistent conclusions regarding the positive relationship between wue and pr and that between wue and ta however this is contrary to s sun et al 2018 who reported a negative correlation between the spatially averaged annual wue and the annual mean values of ta and p in china using a process based model s sun et al 2018 explained that this discrepancy results from the difference between site based data and integrated regional values the shap results in the present study based on integrated regional data however suggest inconsistent conclusions on wue responses as compared to previous studies regarding pr a linear relationship with wue was found as high wue values were accompanied by high pr values in terms of the spatial pattern fig 3 a5 fig 4 a5 fig 7 a5 highly productive vegetation is accompanied by a water rich environment e g its stomatal conductance as affected by evolved anatomical morphological or physiological characteristics is much less constrained adams et al 2021 and its wue is less constrained by water the effect is contrary for water constrained vegetation therefore pr which shows a side of the richness of the local water resources played a significant role in shaping the spatial pattern of wue q zhu et al 2011 in this case wue was found to respond linearly to pr however the shap results seem more conservative in terms of their multi year trend as locations with a stable trend in annual pr spr 0 mm yr 1 were found to make the largest positive contributions to swue fig 7 b5 and these locations occupied the largest area of the study area areas with large absolute values of spr are mainly concentrated in taiwan in east china and the qinghai tibet alpine zone in southwest china where spr had a relatively large negative contribution to swue fig 3 b5 fig 4 b5 for the arid and semi arid alpine regions the limited water resources may cause a positive response of swue to spr as for the humid east china region where vegetation productivity is less limited by water higher pr increase may intensify local evaporation or increase water overload resulting in a decrease in wue regarding the spatial pattern of wue the shap results of xmlm indicated that ta and wue were negatively correlated fig 7 a3 consistent bai et al 2020 s sun et al 2018 or contradictory x j zhu et al 2015 results have been found in previous studies the response of wue to ta is different in different ecosystems due to the different responses of gpp and et to ta x j zhu et al 2015 suggested that the distribution of ta in china is closely related to the distribution of the lai and that ta may indirectly affect wue by influencing the lai due to the larger lai in warmer regions bai et al 2020 suggested that ta may also affect wue by directly influencing vapor pressure deficit further efforts are needed to explore the mechanism behind the results of the xmlm analysis the xmls shap results showed that the optimal value of sta for swue growth was about 0 077 k yr 1 fig 7 b3 however the sta of most sample points was lower than this value fig 3 b3 and had a positive correlation with swue fig 7 b3 which may indicate that most regions still have room to promote wue gain by increasing ta growth previous studies have found a negative correlation between wue and radiation y li et al 2018 x j zhu et al 2015 this is because the photosynthetic light response curve is usually a non regular rectangular hyperbola xu et al 2019 excessive light however may lead to photoinhibition which is characterized by a decrease in the photosynthetic electron transport rate photooxidative damage decreases in co2 uptake and the accumulation of dry matter demmig adams and adams 2017 in particular for plateaus where there is high radiation and a low co2 concentration the negative response of gpp to radiation is evident fig 3 a4 b4 fig 4 a4 b4 q yu et al 2002 furthermore a recent study suggests that radiation is strongly correlated with transpiration independent of the stomatal conductance mechanism boese et al 2017 moreover radiation driven transpiration enhancement and a radiation stimulated rise in soil evaporation may allow et rather than gpp to exhibit greater sensitivity to sr y li et al 2018 thus at the ecosystem scale it is reasonable that areas in the study region with high sr and ssr values were accompanied by lesser wue and swue gains fig 7 a4 b4 4 4 wue trend response to mean annual wue according to our results the spatial pattern of wue determined the spatial pattern of swue fig 6 b specifically swue responded to wue non monotonically i e the shap values first increased and then decreased along the wue gradients with the threshold being 1 9 gcm 2mm 1yr 1 fig 7 b6 this means that areas with larger wue have limited potential for wue enhancement and these areas are mainly distributed in the eastern region of china fig 2 however for the large areas with lower wue in the western part of china there is still room for improvement in wue fig 2 5 conclusions the factors that drive wue variation are mixed and contrasted across different regions based on two xml models the individualized effects of ca ndep and climatic factors on the spatial and trend variations in wue across china between 1982 and 2015 were disentangled the xml models consisted of an xgboost machine learning model which was used to fit the nonlinear relationship between the response factors and the drivers and a shap explanation model which quantified the effect of each driver on each sample as shap values among the two xml models one xmlm was used to detect the nonlinear relationships between the 34 year averages of the annual values of wue and those of ta sr pr ca and ndep the other model xmls was used to explore the relationships between the trend slopes of the annual variation in wue and the environmental factors further by aggregating the spatial shap values obtained by the two models it was explored how wue responds to the driving factors in terms of the multi year averages and trend changes over the study area statistical analyses based on the xml parsing results were conducted as follows first the factor importance was defined as the mean of all absolute shap values in the space and the dominant factor at each 0 5 degree area was defined as the driving factor with the largest absolute shap value as a result it was found that the mean annual pr played a dominant role in shaping the spatial pattern of wue and the spatial pattern of wue contributed the most to the trend of wue in china over the last three decades moreover the shap values obtained for each factor were plotted along the gradient of the factor magnitude thus allowing for the holistic observation of how the drivers affect the wue the combination of the results of the multi year average and trend analysis reveals the following 1 ca benefits wue gains but the ca driven gains in wue decrease with elevated ca growth rates 2 although spatial variation in ndep has a slight impact on the spatial pattern of wue the change of ndep had a different and significant impact on wue growth in light of different nutrient limitations on the local vegetation 3 among the meteorological factors wue responds negatively to ta and positively to pr spatially and the trends in ta and pr are most favorable for wue growth when they are close to the threshold of 0 077 k yr 1 and 0 mm yr 1 respectively moreover the growth of sr consistently inhibits the growth of wue xml methods exhibit the strong potential to explain the complex relationships between components the machine learning approach enables the exploration of the complex relationships between wue and its drivers moreover the shap explanation framework decomposes the model output of each sample point into the contribution values of each driver thereby allowing for the interpretation of the wue response both globally and locally the main uncertainty arises from the need for more in depth descriptions of the different ecosystems in the aggregated analysis based on spatial data further this uncertainty may be amplified by local accuracy one of the essential properties of shap regardless xml was employed to provide valuable information from another perspective on how wue responds to environmental factors in summary the xml interpretation can improve the understanding of wue variation 6 data availability statement the gpp

1783,a soil water characteristic curve swcc is a prerequisite relationship to study water transport in unsaturated soils and has significant applications in agriculture and engineering sciences therefore many swcc models were proposed and improved the understanding of water transport many of these models were obtained depending on the particle size distribution psd because the water content is related to the sizes and distributions of particles and pores in soils however the continuous psd was divided into many fractions to calculate the water content in these models moreover the particles and pores were simplified as spheres and cylinders respectively these simplifications are idealistic and contrary to actual complex structures in soils to solve the above limitations of these models we considered the weibull distribution and fractal theory and established a universal swcc model called pf psd and fractal theory based on the continuous psd and irregularities of the pore structures the new proposed pf model was verified by measured data in the unsoda database furthermore its accuracy was proven by comparison with two classical models widely used the verification and comparison results show that the pf model can well describe the measured data of various types of soils and has fewer errors than the other two models meanwhile the continuous psd in this study overcomes the limitation of artificial discretization and is convenient for subsequent calculation in addition the actual irregular soil geometry is described by the fractal theory which well matches complex soil structures therefore the pf model based on the psd and the fractal theory is reasonable and reliable in predicting swcc in addition this study can provide a foundation and reference for subsequent studies on hydraulic behaviors keywords soil water characteristic curve particle size distribution weibull distribution fractal theory matric suction water content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil water characteristic curve swcc is an important hydraulic property that describes the relationship between the matric suction and water content in unsaturated soils aung et al 2001 sillers et al 2001 mohammadi vanclooster 2011 the swcc has wide applications in engineering and agricultural subjects such as geotechnical engineering environmental engineering hydraulic engineering and other research areas mohammadi et al 2009 russell 2014 tomas et al 2018 li vanapalli 2022 in particular it is an essential property in analyzing water transport solute transport and water retention in soils mohammadi et al 2009 meskini vishkaee et al 2014 therefore study on the swcc can improve the understanding of water retention and transport in soils as well as provide a reference for subsequent studies of hydraulic properties to date many mathematical models for the swcc have been proposed based on measured data and theoretical derivations and they are mainly empirical models and theoretical models the empirical models were obtained by fitting discrete measured data brooks corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 zhang van genuchten 1994 fredlund and xing 1994 which gives a continuous equation for a set of specific test data and makes the scattered data convenient for theoretical calculation van genuchten 1980 arya paris 1981 however these empirical models often contain fitted parameters changing with different soils and they also do not connect the swcc with fundamental physical properties these limitations shorten their wide application to solve these limitations many theoretical models have been developed based on the particle size distribution psd pore size and distribution soil bulk density void ratio clay content and so on arya paris 1981 fredlund et al 2002 fredlund 2006 hwang choi 2005 chiu et al 2012 mohammadi vanclooster 2011 chang cheng 2018 chang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 chen et al 2021 the theoretical models can indicate the influence of some physical characteristics of soils on the swcc and facilitate the analysis of the mechanism of water retention and transport in soils in these models the psd was artificially divided into a limited number of fractions to determine the water content and the discretization of the psd cannot comprehensively describe the sizes and contents of soil particles and further decrease the accuracy of the swcc prediction in addition when the pore radius is given as an expression of the particle radius in these models the geometries of the soil particles and pores are presumed to be spherical and capillary cylindrical respectively arya and paris 1981 mohammadi vanclooster 2011 actually the scanning electron microscope sem image shows that the soil particles are irregular and the pores are also curved and complex fig 1 qin et al 2021 therefore the above assumptions about the particles and pores deviate from the actual soil structures to realistically reflect the complex geometry of soil particles and pores the fractal theory quantitatively describing the irregularity of objects is widely used in soil science mandelbrot john 1983 wheatcraft tyler 1988 tyler wheatcraft 1992 xu 2004 chu et al 2020 chen et al 2021 to solve the above limitations in empirical and theoretical models we established a universal pf model depending on the psd and the fractal theory in the pf model the weibull distribution is used to describe the psd then we took into account the complexity of pore structures and obtained a relation between the particle size and pore size after that an expression for the matric suction and the particle size was built based on the young laplace equation eventually the equation for matric suction and water content is derived the pf model was verified by measured data of different types of soils in the unsoda database furthermore its accuracy was proven by comparison with two classical models widely used in addition the root means square errors rmse also reflect that the prediction swccs of the pf model are reasonable and the error is acceptable in this study the continuous psd can accurately reflect the particle distribution and is easier to apply to the calculation besides using fractal theory to characterize the bending pores is more realistic for soils and gives a universal relation between particle size and pore size therefore the pf model built by the psd and the fractal theory is reasonable and reliable moreover this study can provide a reference for subsequent studies on hydraulic and mechanical behaviors such as the permeability coefficient water migration and solute transport deformation and strength of unsaturated soils 2 theoretical framework 2 1 model description the swcc connects the water content with the matric suction dependent on adsorption and capillary actions lu and likos 2004 zhang lu 2018 lu zhang 2019 accordingly the water content is composed of both adsorptive and capillary waters shown in fig 2 zhang lu 2018 and its expression was given by campbell shiozawa 1992 lebeau konrad 2010 1 θ w θ c 1 θ c θ s θ a where θ w is the volumetric water content cm3 cm3 θ c is the capillary water cm3 cm3 θ a is the adsorptive water cm3 cm3 and θ s is the saturated volumetric water content cm3 cm3 in the following parts θ a and θ c are calculated respectively in soils a part of the pore water is adsorbed on the surface of the particles in the form of thin films due to the short range adsorption effects lu and likos 2004 and the adsorptive water can be expressed as the following campbell shiozawa 1992 lebeau konrad 2010 2 θ a θ 0 1 ln ψ ln ψ max where θ 0 is the volumetric water content due to adsorption at a matric suction of 9 8 kpa cm3 cm3 ψ is the matric suction kpa and ψ max is the matric suction at oven dryness kpa in addition another part of the pore water in soils is capillary water and its content is mainly influenced by soil particles pore structure pore size and distribution lu and likos 2004 chen et al 2021 the pores with a radius less than or equal to r are presumed to be water filled thus the capillary water may be described as follows 3 θ c v v r v 0 e n v s r v 0 where v v is the cumulative volume of pores smaller than a certain pore radius cm3 v 0 is the total volume of soil cm3 r is the mean pore radius cm e n is the void ratio and v s is the cumulative volume of particles smaller than a certain particle radius cm3 and it is obtained from the psd which will be described in the next section 2 2 probability description of the psd to solve the problem that the psd is artificially divided into many fractions and decrease the accuracy of the swcc continuous expressions are used to describe the psd among which the weibull distribution has good description ability esmaeelnejad et al 2016 bayat et al 2015 therefore the particle radius of a soil sample can be regarded as a random variable and assumed to follow the weibull distribution the cumulative distribution of particles smaller than a specific radius can be expressed as 4 f r r 1 e r α β where r is the mean particle radius cm α and β are the scale and shape parameters of the weibull distribution and α 0 β 0 hence the particle volume distribution function can be obtained f v s v s 1 p v s v s 1 p r 3 v s 1 4 π 3 5 f r 3 v s 1 4 π 3 1 e 1 α 3 v s 1 4 π 3 β where v s 1 is the particle volume cm3 substitute eq 5 to eq 3 can take the following form 6 θ c n 1 e 1 α 3 v s 1 4 π 3 β where n is porosity and n e n ρ d ρ s in which ρ d is the soil dry density g cm3 and ρ s is the particle density g cm3 2 3 relation between particle radius and pore radius the equation for the pore radius and particle radius is obtained by considering the irregular pore shape and using the void ratio assuming that the void ratio calculated by any particle radius and corresponding pore radius is equal to the total soil void ratio e n arya paris 1981 tyler wheatcraft 1989 that is 7 e n v v v s v v n s v s 1 where v v is the total pore volume for any pore radius per unit mass cm3 v s and n s are the total particle volume cm3 and the number of particles for any particle radius per unit mass respectively and n s c r d s where c is a positive constant r is the mean particle radius of the soil cm and d s is the fractal dimension of soils mandelbrot john 1983 wheatcraft tyler 1988 xu 2004 therefore the particle volume smaller than a specific particle radius can be specified as follows v r r min r v s 1 d n s r min r n s d v s 1 8 4 3 π c r 3 d s r min 3 d s where r is the mean particle radius of the soil cm and r min is the minimum particle radius of the soil cm from eq 8 it is easy to obtain the total volume of particles 9 v s 0 1 ρ s 4 3 π c r max 3 d s r min 3 d s where ρ s is the soil particle density g cm3 if the minimum particle radius is assumed to be 0 that is r min 0 then the constant can be given as 10 c 3 4 π ρ s r max 3 d s thus the number of particles for any particle radius per unit mass will be expressed as 11 n s c r d s 3 4 π ρ s r max 3 d s r d s to study water transport in soils the pore structure is usually assumed to be bundles of cylindrical capillaries with different pore radii fig 3 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2022 straight capillaries are convenient for the quantitative calculation of pore volume but the actual pores are complex and tortuous mufti das 2022 therefore the shape of the cylindrical capillary is generalized and the pores are considered to be curved capillaries of uniform section fig 3 chu et al 2020 the volume of fractal capillary for a certain pore radius in the soil is given by wheatcraft tyler 1988 12 v v π r 2 l f where r is the pore radius cm and l f is the actual length of the fractal capillary cm and can be expressed as follows wheatcraft tyler 1988 13 l f l s d v ε c 1 d v where ε c is the minimum length unit to measure the length of the fractal line cm d v is the fractal dimension that reflects the irregularity of pores and l s is the straight line distance of the fractal line cm substitute eqs 11 13 to eq 7 and get 14 r a r b where a and b are both constants derived from the geometry and

data and models for verifying the pf model unsoda is a database of hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils built by the u s salinity laboratory which is part of the department of agriculture it collects the swccs hydraulic conductivities particle size distributions and bulk densities of 11 soils including sandy and clay soils nemes et al 2001 because this database contains sufficient experimental data and corresponding soil information it is widely cited to validate theoretical models chang cheng 2018 chang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 therefore we also selected the measured swccs of 39 soil samples from 5 soil textures in the unsoda database to verify the accuracy of the pf model the codes and textures of these soils are listed in table 1 the bulk density and void ratio of the selected soil samples as well as the psd parameters are shown in table 2 to further confirm the accuracy of the pf model the classical arya paris ap model arya paris 1981 and mohammadi vanclooster mv model mohammadi vanclooster 2011 were selected to compare with the pf model in addition the root means square errors rmse of different models are also calculated to reflect the effectiveness of the pf model 4 model validation according to the measured matric suctions from the unsoda database the theoretical water contents of 5 soil textures were calculated based on the pf ap and mv models fig 4 shows these predicted and measured water contents the water contents calculated by the pf model are evenly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line with fluctuations of only 6 this phenomenon implies that the pf model well characterizes the swccs of various soils for the ap model the calculated water contents deviate from the measured values and especially many of them are located above the 1 1 line which indicates that the ap model easily overestimates the water content compared with the ap model the mv model has a smaller deviation from the 1 1 line however it is less accurate than the pf model and especially underestimates the water contents in high matric suctions therefore the pf model has the lowest prediction error and highest accuracy among the three models to quantify the errors between the measured and calculated data of the three models rmses were calculated for different soils and were shown in the form of box plots fig 5 and the details were listed in table 3 the three models all have small errors for coarse grained soils in the sand soils as the content of fine particles increases and the pore structure becomes complex in soils the ap and mv models exhibit large errors for the loam soils and even the maximum error of the ap model can reach 0 3052 while it is only 0 0509 for the pf model moreover as the fine particles further increase the predicted errors of the mv model increase in the clay soils and the maximum error is 0 3004 in the clay soils the pf model has the highest prediction accuracy among the three theoretical models although its error has a significant increase in general the average rmses of the pf ap and mv models are 0 0538 0 1624 and 0 1701 respectively these statistical data comparisons show that the pf model has high accuracy and wide application for different soils fig 6 demonstrates the measured and calculated swccs of different soils we can see that the swccs predicted by all three models agree well with the measured data in the low matric suction section 1kpa however when the matric suction is over 1 kpa approximately equal to the air entry value the ap model shows remarkable errors because the swcc calculated with the ap method is influenced with the mass of the soil you et al 2022 however the pf model has a particularly significant advantage in the prediction accuracy of the swcc when matric suction is in the above range since the model takes into account the physically meaningful fractal dimension to describe the curved pore fig 6 as the matric suction increases to 100 kpa the water in the pore is almost drained but a small part of the water remains due to the short range adsorption effects caused by the particles in this section the mv model has much deviation from the measured curves compared with the other two models which is caused by that the mv model only considers capillary water and cannot describe the adsorption capacity of soil particles moreover the underestimation of water content by the mv model in the high matric suction increases with increasing fine particle content fig 6 c d e and the maximum difference between the calculated and measured water content increases from 5 18 to 9 97 however the maximum difference for the pf model is only 1 34 and 3 32 respectively therefore the pf model can well describe the swcc in the full matric suction for different soils since it takes into account not only capillary action but also adsorption 5 discussion 5 1 the advantage of continuous psd the segregation of psd is a requirement for swcc calculation in the ap and mv models campos guereta et al 2021 however the number of fractions influences the accuracy of the quantitative description of psd fig 7 which affects the relationship between particle size and pore size campos guereta et al 2021 and further affects the accuracy of swcc fig 8 therefore it is wise that the pf model takes into account a continuous probability distribution function to express the psd the results show that the weibull distribution not only accurately describes the characteristics of the psd fig 7 but also has higher accuracy than the discrete psd in the swcc calculation fig 8 5 2 influence of pore shapes on swcc since the geometry of soil particles and pore structure have an effect on water retention and water transport in soils the swcc is linked to soil geometry therefore the pf model introduces the fractal dimension to reflect the complexity of soil geometry when the pore fractal dimension dv 1 the pores are cylindrical capillaries when dv 1 the pore geometry is curved the effect of fractal dimension on swcc is shown in fig 9 and it can be seen that the calculated swcc has significantly high accuracy when considering complex pore structures 5 3 contribution of capillary and adsorption actions fig 10 shows the swccs and the performance of capillary and adsorption actions for two different soils for both sand and clay soils the variation of capillary and adsorptive water with matric suction are the same as those in the literatures campbell shiozawa 1992 lebeau konrad 2010 due to the large pore content of coarse grained soil such as sand code 4282 capillary water is the main component of water content when the matric suction reaches to about 100 kpa the capillary water drains out and the adsorptive water becomes the main component of the residual water content on the contrary fine grained soils such as clay code 4680 contain high adsorptive water content because of the large specific surface and strong attraction to water molecules when the matric suction reaches to 10 kpa approximately equal to the air entry value the capillary water content decreases rapidly and the adsorptive water becomes the main component of the water content 6 conclusions in this study a universal pf model is established to calculate the swcc for different soils based on the continuous psd and fractal theory in the pf model the weibull distribution is used to describe the psd and the fractal dimension is used to characterize the curved pore in addition the pf model is validated with measured data and also verified with two classical models combined with the above analysis the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 we introduce the weibull distribution to describe the psd which improves the precision of quantifying the psd and the continuous psd overcomes the limitation of artificial discretization and is convenient for subsequent calculation 2 a new relationship between particle size and pore size has been drawn based on a physically meaningful fractal dimension that reflects the complexity of the pore structure thus the pf model is established based on the relationship continuous psd and the young laplace equation 3 compared with the measured swccs of various types of soils the pf model agrees well with the experimental data indicating that the pf model can be used to calculate the swccs in the full range of matric suction for different soils 4 compared with the ap and mv models the pf model has the highest accuracy and the lowest error among the three models indicating that the pf model is stable for

1783,a soil water characteristic curve swcc is a prerequisite relationship to study water transport in unsaturated soils and has significant applications in agriculture and engineering sciences therefore many swcc models were proposed and improved the understanding of water transport many of these models were obtained depending on the particle size distribution psd because the water content is related to the sizes and distributions of particles and pores in soils however the continuous psd was divided into many fractions to calculate the water content in these models moreover the particles and pores were simplified as spheres and cylinders respectively these simplifications are idealistic and contrary to actual complex structures in soils to solve the above limitations of these models we considered the weibull distribution and fractal theory and established a universal swcc model called pf psd and fractal theory based on the continuous psd and irregularities of the pore structures the new proposed pf model was verified by measured data in the unsoda database furthermore its accuracy was proven by comparison with two classical models widely used the verification and comparison results show that the pf model can well describe the measured data of various types of soils and has fewer errors than the other two models meanwhile the continuous psd in this study overcomes the limitation of artificial discretization and is convenient for subsequent calculation in addition the actual irregular soil geometry is described by the fractal theory which well matches complex soil structures therefore the pf model based on the psd and the fractal theory is reasonable and reliable in predicting swcc in addition this study can provide a foundation and reference for subsequent studies on hydraulic behaviors keywords soil water characteristic curve particle size distribution weibull distribution fractal theory matric suction water content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil water characteristic curve swcc is an important hydraulic property that describes the relationship between the matric suction and water content in unsaturated soils aung et al 2001 sillers et al 2001 mohammadi vanclooster 2011 the swcc has wide applications in engineering and agricultural subjects such as geotechnical engineering environmental engineering hydraulic engineering and other research areas mohammadi et al 2009 russell 2014 tomas et al 2018 li vanapalli 2022 in particular it is an essential property in analyzing water transport solute transport and water retention in soils mohammadi et al 2009 meskini vishkaee et al 2014 therefore study on the swcc can improve the understanding of water retention and transport in soils as well as provide a reference for subsequent studies of hydraulic properties to date many mathematical models for the swcc have been proposed based on measured data and theoretical derivations and they are mainly empirical models and theoretical models the empirical models were obtained by fitting discrete measured data brooks corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 zhang van genuchten 1994 fredlund and xing 1994 which gives a continuous equation for a set of specific test data and makes the scattered data convenient for theoretical calculation van genuchten 1980 arya paris 1981 however these empirical models often contain fitted parameters changing with different soils and they also do not connect the swcc with fundamental physical properties these limitations shorten their wide application to solve these limitations many theoretical models have been developed based on the particle size distribution psd pore size and distribution soil bulk density void ratio clay content and so on arya paris 1981 fredlund et al 2002 fredlund 2006 hwang choi 2005 chiu et al 2012 mohammadi vanclooster 2011 chang cheng 2018 chang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 chen et al 2021 the theoretical models can indicate the influence of some physical characteristics of soils on the swcc and facilitate the analysis of the mechanism of water retention and transport in soils in these models the psd was artificially divided into a limited number of fractions to determine the water content and the discretization of the psd cannot comprehensively describe the sizes and contents of soil particles and further decrease the accuracy of the swcc prediction in addition when the pore radius is given as an expression of the particle radius in these models the geometries of the soil particles and pores are presumed to be spherical and capillary cylindrical respectively arya and paris 1981 mohammadi vanclooster 2011 actually the scanning electron microscope sem image shows that the soil particles are irregular and the pores are also curved and complex fig 1 qin et al 2021 therefore the above assumptions about the particles and pores deviate from the actual soil structures to realistically reflect the complex geometry of soil particles and pores the fractal theory quantitatively describing the irregularity of objects is widely used in soil science mandelbrot john 1983 wheatcraft tyler 1988 tyler wheatcraft 1992 xu 2004 chu et al 2020 chen et al 2021 to solve the above limitations in empirical and theoretical models we established a universal pf model depending on the psd and the fractal theory in the pf model the weibull distribution is used to describe the psd then we took into account the complexity of pore structures and obtained a relation between the particle size and pore size after that an expression for the matric suction and the particle size was built based on the young laplace equation eventually the equation for matric suction and water content is derived the pf model was verified by measured data of different types of soils in the unsoda database furthermore its accuracy was proven by comparison with two classical models widely used in addition the root means square errors rmse also reflect that the prediction swccs of the pf model are reasonable and the error is acceptable in this study the continuous psd can accurately reflect the particle distribution and is easier to apply to the calculation besides using fractal theory to characterize the bending pores is more realistic for soils and gives a universal relation between particle size and pore size therefore the pf model built by the psd and the fractal theory is reasonable and reliable moreover this study can provide a reference for subsequent studies on hydraulic and mechanical behaviors such as the permeability coefficient water migration and solute transport deformation and strength of unsaturated soils 2 theoretical framework 2 1 model description the swcc connects the water content with the matric suction dependent on adsorption and capillary actions lu and likos 2004 zhang lu 2018 lu zhang 2019 accordingly the water content is composed of both adsorptive and capillary waters shown in fig 2 zhang lu 2018 and its expression was given by campbell shiozawa 1992 lebeau konrad 2010 1 θ w θ c 1 θ c θ s θ a where θ w is the volumetric water content cm3 cm3 θ c is the capillary water cm3 cm3 θ a is the adsorptive water cm3 cm3 and θ s is the saturated volumetric water content cm3 cm3 in the following parts θ a and θ c are calculated respectively in soils a part of the pore water is adsorbed on the surface of the particles in the form of thin films due to the short range adsorption effects lu and likos 2004 and the adsorptive water can be expressed as the following campbell shiozawa 1992 lebeau konrad 2010 2 θ a θ 0 1 ln ψ ln ψ max where θ 0 is the volumetric water content due to adsorption at a matric suction of 9 8 kpa cm3 cm3 ψ is the matric suction kpa and ψ max is the matric suction at oven dryness kpa in addition another part of the pore water in soils is capillary water and its content is mainly influenced by soil particles pore structure pore size and distribution lu and likos 2004 chen et al 2021 the pores with a radius less than or equal to r are presumed to be water filled thus the capillary water may be described as follows 3 θ c v v r v 0 e n v s r v 0 where v v is the cumulative volume of pores smaller than a certain pore radius cm3 v 0 is the total volume of soil cm3 r is the mean pore radius cm e n is the void ratio and v s is the cumulative volume of particles smaller than a certain particle radius cm3 and it is obtained from the psd which will be described in the next section 2 2 probability description of the psd to solve the problem that the psd is artificially divided into many fractions and decrease the accuracy of the swcc continuous expressions are used to describe the psd among which the weibull distribution has good description ability esmaeelnejad et al 2016 bayat et al 2015 therefore the particle radius of a soil sample can be regarded as a random variable and assumed to follow the weibull distribution the cumulative distribution of particles smaller than a specific radius can be expressed as 4 f r r 1 e r α β where r is the mean particle radius cm α and β are the scale and shape parameters of the weibull distribution and α 0 β 0 hence the particle volume distribution function can be obtained f v s v s 1 p v s v s 1 p r 3 v s 1 4 π 3 5 f r 3 v s 1 4 π 3 1 e 1 α 3 v s 1 4 π 3 β where v s 1 is the particle volume cm3 substitute eq 5 to eq 3 can take the following form 6 θ c n 1 e 1 α 3 v s 1 4 π 3 β where n is porosity and n e n ρ d ρ s in which ρ d is the soil dry density g cm3 and ρ s is the particle density g cm3 2 3 relation between particle radius and pore radius the equation for the pore radius and particle radius is obtained by considering the irregular pore shape and using the void ratio assuming that the void ratio calculated by any particle radius and corresponding pore radius is equal to the total soil void ratio e n arya paris 1981 tyler wheatcraft 1989 that is 7 e n v v v s v v n s v s 1 where v v is the total pore volume for any pore radius per unit mass cm3 v s and n s are the total particle volume cm3 and the number of particles for any particle radius per unit mass respectively and n s c r d s where c is a positive constant r is the mean particle radius of the soil cm and d s is the fractal dimension of soils mandelbrot john 1983 wheatcraft tyler 1988 xu 2004 therefore the particle volume smaller than a specific particle radius can be specified as follows v r r min r v s 1 d n s r min r n s d v s 1 8 4 3 π c r 3 d s r min 3 d s where r is the mean particle radius of the soil cm and r min is the minimum particle radius of the soil cm from eq 8 it is easy to obtain the total volume of particles 9 v s 0 1 ρ s 4 3 π c r max 3 d s r min 3 d s where ρ s is the soil particle density g cm3 if the minimum particle radius is assumed to be 0 that is r min 0 then the constant can be given as 10 c 3 4 π ρ s r max 3 d s thus the number of particles for any particle radius per unit mass will be expressed as 11 n s c r d s 3 4 π ρ s r max 3 d s r d s to study water transport in soils the pore structure is usually assumed to be bundles of cylindrical capillaries with different pore radii fig 3 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2022 straight capillaries are convenient for the quantitative calculation of pore volume but the actual pores are complex and tortuous mufti das 2022 therefore the shape of the cylindrical capillary is generalized and the pores are considered to be curved capillaries of uniform section fig 3 chu et al 2020 the volume of fractal capillary for a certain pore radius in the soil is given by wheatcraft tyler 1988 12 v v π r 2 l f where r is the pore radius cm and l f is the actual length of the fractal capillary cm and can be expressed as follows wheatcraft tyler 1988 13 l f l s d v ε c 1 d v where ε c is the minimum length unit to measure the length of the fractal line cm d v is the fractal dimension that reflects the irregularity of pores and l s is the straight line distance of the fractal line cm substitute eqs 11 13 to eq 7 and get 14 r a r b where a and b are both constants derived from the geometry and physical properties of the soil and a 1 5 d v e n π 1 d v r max d v 1 d s 3 ρ s 1 d v 1 3 d s d v 1 d s and b 3 d v 3 d s d v 1 d s in unsaturated soils the matrix suction makes the bending liquid

matric suction kpa σ s denotes the surface tension mn m φ represent contact angle and r is the pore radius cm substituting eq 14 and eq 15 to eq 6 leads to the following equation of the capillary water 16 θ c n 1 e a α 2 σ s c o s φ ψ b β combined with eqs 1 2 and 16 the swcc can be derived as follows 17 θ w θ 0 1 ln ψ ln ψ max 1 θ 0 1 ln ψ ln ψ max θ s n n e a α 2 σ s c o s φ ψ b β 3 measured data and models for verifying the pf model unsoda is a database of hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils built by the u s salinity laboratory which is part of the department of agriculture it collects the swccs hydraulic conductivities particle size distributions and bulk densities of 11 soils including sandy and clay soils nemes et al 2001 because this database contains sufficient experimental data and corresponding soil information it is widely cited to validate theoretical models chang cheng 2018 chang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 therefore we also selected the measured swccs of 39 soil samples from 5 soil textures in the unsoda database to verify the accuracy of the pf model the codes and textures of these soils are listed in table 1 the bulk density and void ratio of the selected soil samples as well as the psd parameters are shown in table 2 to further confirm the accuracy of the pf model the classical arya paris ap model arya paris 1981 and mohammadi vanclooster mv model mohammadi vanclooster 2011 were selected to compare with the pf model in addition the root means square errors rmse of different models are also calculated to reflect the effectiveness of the pf model 4 model validation according to the measured matric suctions from the unsoda database the theoretical water contents of 5 soil textures were calculated based on the pf ap and mv models fig 4 shows these predicted and measured water contents the water contents calculated by the pf model are evenly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line with fluctuations of only 6 this phenomenon implies that the pf model well characterizes the swccs of various soils for the ap model the calculated water contents deviate from the measured values and especially many of them are located above the 1 1 line which indicates that the ap model easily overestimates the water content compared with the ap model the mv model has a smaller deviation from the 1 1 line however it is less accurate than the pf model and especially underestimates the water contents in high matric suctions therefore the pf model has the lowest prediction error and highest accuracy among the three models to quantify the errors between the measured and calculated data of the three models rmses were calculated for different soils and were shown in the form of box plots fig 5 and the details were listed in table 3 the three models all have small errors for coarse grained soils in the sand soils as the content of fine particles increases and the pore structure becomes complex in soils the ap and mv models exhibit large errors for the loam soils and even the maximum error of the ap model can reach 0 3052 while it is only 0 0509 for the pf model moreover as the fine particles further increase the predicted errors of the mv model increase in the clay soils and the maximum error is 0 3004 in the clay soils the pf model has the highest prediction accuracy among the three theoretical models although its error has a significant increase in general the average rmses of the pf ap and mv models are 0 0538 0 1624 and 0 1701 respectively these statistical data comparisons show that the pf model has high accuracy and wide application for different soils fig 6 demonstrates the measured and calculated swccs of different soils we can see that the swccs predicted by all three models agree well with the measured data in the low matric suction section 1kpa however when the matric suction is over 1 kpa approximately equal to the air entry value the ap model shows remarkable errors because the swcc calculated with the ap method is influenced with the mass of the soil you et al 2022 however the pf model has a particularly significant advantage in the prediction accuracy of the swcc when matric suction is in the above range since the model takes into account the physically meaningful fractal dimension to describe the curved pore fig 6 as the matric suction increases to 100 kpa the water in the pore is almost drained but a small part of the water remains due to the short range adsorption effects caused by the particles in this section the mv model has much deviation from the measured curves compared with the other two models which is caused by that the mv model only considers capillary water and cannot describe the adsorption capacity of soil particles moreover the underestimation of water content by the mv model in the high matric suction increases with increasing fine particle content fig 6 c d e and the maximum difference between the calculated and measured water content increases from 5 18 to 9 97 however the maximum difference for the pf model is only 1 34 and 3 32 respectively therefore the pf model can well describe the swcc in the full matric suction for different soils since it takes into account not only capillary action but also adsorption 5 discussion 5 1 the advantage of continuous psd the segregation of psd is a requirement for swcc calculation in the ap and mv models campos guereta et al 2021 however the number of fractions influences the accuracy of the quantitative description of psd fig 7 which affects the relationship between particle size and pore size campos guereta et al 2021 and further affects the accuracy of swcc fig 8 therefore it is wise that the pf model takes into account a continuous probability distribution function to express the psd the results show that the weibull distribution not only accurately describes the characteristics of the psd fig 7 but also has higher accuracy than the discrete psd in the swcc calculation fig 8 5 2 influence of pore shapes on swcc since the geometry of soil particles and pore structure have an effect on water retention and water transport in soils the swcc is linked to soil geometry therefore the pf model introduces the fractal dimension to reflect the complexity of soil geometry when the pore fractal dimension dv 1 the pores are cylindrical capillaries when dv 1 the pore geometry is curved the effect of fractal dimension on swcc is shown in fig 9 and it can be seen that the calculated swcc has significantly high accuracy when considering complex pore structures 5 3 contribution of capillary and adsorption actions fig 10 shows the swccs and the performance of capillary and adsorption actions for two different soils for both sand and clay soils the variation of capillary and adsorptive water with matric suction are the same as those in the literatures campbell shiozawa 1992 lebeau konrad 2010 due to the large pore content of coarse grained soil such as sand code 4282 capillary water is the main component of water content when the matric suction reaches to about 100 kpa the capillary water drains out and the adsorptive water becomes the main component of the residual water content on the contrary fine grained soils such as clay code 4680 contain high adsorptive water content because of the large specific surface and strong attraction to water molecules when the matric suction reaches to 10 kpa approximately equal to the air entry value the capillary water content decreases rapidly and the adsorptive water becomes the main component of the water content 6 conclusions in this study a universal pf model is established to calculate the swcc for different soils based on the continuous psd and fractal theory in the pf model the weibull distribution is used to describe the psd and the fractal dimension is used to characterize the curved pore in addition the pf model is validated with measured data and also verified with two classical models combined with the above analysis the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 we introduce the weibull distribution to describe the psd which improves the precision of quantifying the psd and the continuous psd overcomes the limitation of artificial discretization and is convenient for subsequent calculation 2 a new relationship between particle size and pore size has been drawn based on a physically meaningful fractal dimension that reflects the complexity of the pore structure thus the pf model is established based on the relationship continuous psd and the young laplace equation 3 compared with the measured swccs of various types of soils the pf model agrees well with the experimental data indicating that the pf model can be used to calculate the swccs in the full range of matric suction for different soils 4 compared with the ap and mv models the pf model has the highest accuracy and the lowest error among the three models indicating that the pf model is stable for

1784,the frequent earthquakes in the loess area and the geological disasters induced by them have caused huge threats to the safety and property of the local residents and most disasters are highly dependent on moisture in the soils in this study the effects of pre dynamic loading on the hydraulic properties of loess are investigated through the variation of soil water characteristic curves which control the interaction between soil and moisture the results are analyzed based on the combination of mercury intrusion porosimetry mip and scanning electron microscope sem tests which reveal the influence of pre dynamic loads on microstructure for a more comprehensive understanding it is found that both the initial water content of soil samples and the magnitude of applied pre dynamic loads have impacts on soil water characteristic curve swcc when initial moisture content is low the dynamic load causes the loess structure to form a seismic damage zone resulting in downward movement of swcc and a reduction in the air entry value when the moisture content is high the soil structure gets denser after vibration leading to reversed influence for both cases the effect increases as the pga amplitude increases the outcomes of different experiments have achieved good agreement keywords pre dynamic treatment loess swcc microstructure mip sem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction early and mainstream studies on seismic liquefaction mainly focused on granular soil howells et al 1976 castro and poulos 1980 mohamad and dobry 1986 iwasaki 1986 bouckovalas et al 2003 tasiopoulou et al 2019 beyzaei et al 2020 to name a few but in recent years the liquefaction of clayey soil has also received increasing attention due to the disasters caused by frequent earthquakes around the loess areas ishihara et al 1990 huang et al 2019 huie et al 2019 in the loess plateau of china the earthquake induced disasters such as liquefaction seismic depressions landslides mudslides and collapses caused severe losses of life and property in history for example magnitude 8 5 haiyuan earthquake in 1920 the most catastrophic earthquake in loess area caused a series of landslides triggered by loess liquefaction at the expense of more than 100 000 lives more recently the magnitude 5 8 yondeng earthquake in 1995 caused 14 deaths 533 injuries and many house collapses another catastrophic earthquake magnitude 8 0 wenchuan earthquake in 2008 which caused 69 227 deaths 17 923 missing and enormous house collapses also resulted in a large number of loess disasters due to the proximity of hypocenter to the loess plateau based on this some researchers devoted their time to the study of clay liquefaction wang et al 2007 conducted the ring shear tests on saturated silt soil mixed with loess and they suggested that the shearing band was vulnerable to liquefaction under undrained condition and an increase in loess content caused a decrease in the peak shear strength and residual strength of the mixture xu et al 2012 also indicated that the cracks developed on the terrace behind the slope formed the dominant channels for water infiltration after in situ investigation zhou et al 2014a b carried out shearing tests on saturated loess and observed obvious dilation and contraction during undrained tests accompanied by increasing pore pressure which finally resulted in the liquefaction zhang et al 2017 conducted consolidated undrained triaxial tests to investigate the shear behavior of saturated loess and confirmed that excess pore water pressure was the key factor affecting the stability of loess landslides peng et al 2019 proposed a hydrological response of loess slopes based on widespread landslide events and suggested that if the bottom layer of loess slope was saturated by irrigation water the static liquefaction was experienced although these research outcomes have made great progress they mainly concentrated on the shearing resistance of loess and soil response during the liquefaction while the investigation about the effects of pre dynamic loads on loess properties is less from a historical point of view earthquakes in seismic zones often take place with multiple events occurring over a short period time which leads to the impact of early earthquakes on the soil response to subsequent earthquakes in other words most of the natural slopes in the seismic zone are not in the most primitive state they have experienced large or small earthquakes in the historical process thus reaching the current stable state therefore it is of theoretical and practical significance to understand the impact of pre dynamic loads on soil many investigations have been conducted to study the pre dynamic responses of cohesionless soil such as sands ecemis et al 2015 ertek and demir 2017 karakan et al 2019 but similar work on clayey soils are less in comparison liu et al 2020a b furthermore the effects of pre dynamic loading on the soil water characteristic curve abbreviated as swcc hereafter are scarce in literature however swcc constitutes a pivotal factor in characterizing the interplay between water and matric suction and is indicative of the soil s water retention capacity typically the curve is presented as a plot of the logarithm of either matric suction or total suction against either the degree of saturation the gravimetric water content or the volumetric water content the swcc encompasses the soil s behavior as it transitions from an initial unsaturated state to a saturated liquefaction state and given that water is a primary factor in earthquake induced geological disasters comprehending the changes in swcc under pre dynamic loading conditions holds practical significance in the analysis and prevention of such disasters it is notable that the water retention capacity discussed in this paper is not equal to the total amount water that can be stored in soil but the amount of water that soil can hold at different hydraulic states i e at different unsaturated states furthermore the swcc plays a crucial role in determining the effective stress parameter χ which is essential in evaluating the effective stress of unsaturated soil given that soil in its natural state is predominantly unsaturated its effective stress and corresponding alterations upon encountering water are closely associated with the swcc the fundamental mechanism of liquefaction involves the gradual accumulation of excess pore water pressure which ultimately diminishes the effective stress of the soil skeleton to zero resulting in the loss of its resistance capacity and its subsequent flow like a liquid hence a precise determination of the initial effective stress prior to seismic loading or water infiltration is imperative to accurately describe the occurrence of liquefaction moreover swcc is critical in the determination of permeability coefficient of unsaturated soils which controls the infiltration process the damage evolution of loess structure dominates the change of mechanical properties and the impact of earthquakes on loess can be fully reflected in the microstructure evolution loess microstructure includes particle contact mode and pore morphology structural changes occur under earthquakes and the evolution of internal structures leads to macroscopic geological disasters such as collapse landslide and mud flow pei et al 2017 liu et al 2020a wu et al 2020 the early earthquake causes the saturated low plastic silt to liquefy directly after the liquefaction the silt is consolidated under the action of self weight stress when the overlying load changes the consolidation stress ratio will be different and new structures will be formed which leads to important impact on the soil response when it experiences another earthquake in the later stage gao 1996 jiang et al 2014 therefore understanding the evolution of microstructure is of great significance to the hydraulic state in loess in this investigation emphasis is given to the effects of pre dynamic loading on the soil water characteristic curve of loess to fill the gap in this field and the results are analyzed and supplemented from the microscopic perspective by mercury intrusion mercury intrusion porosimetry mip test and scanning electron microscope sem observation 2 material and methods 2 1 material the loess used in the study was sampled from heping town lanzhou city china which is located on the fourth terrace of the yellow river the sampling position was around 6 0 m below the ground surface sampling location is illustrated in fig 1 after the soil samples were dug out they were carefully stored in sealed containers and then transferred to laboratory for tests basic geotechnical tests were conducted on the undisturbed soil to obtain the properties of the loess including natural moisture content density specific gravity plastic and liquid limits and particle size distribution in addition mineral compositions of the loess are analyzed and quantified through xrd tests the basic physical properties of the sampled loess are listed in table 1 and the main mineral compositions and corresponding percentages are shown in table 2 the particle size distribution curve is presented in fig 2 2 2 sample preparation in order to restore the properties of the in situ loess as much as possible the experiments were all carried out on the undisturbed loess specimens specifically the soil blocks sampled from the site were roughly cut into cylinders with diameter of 60 80 mm and height of 120 130 mm and then the cylinders were clamped within the soil cutting device the soil cylinder was fixed in the center of the device but allowed to rotate and the distance from the cutting plane to the center or designed diameter of the trimmed sample was controlled by a movable rod by rotating the soil sample and trimming it at a fixed shear plane a soil column with a predetermined diameter can be obtained finally standard triaxial sample with size of 50 100 mm is obtained by measuring the density and water content of several random samples prepared by above method it was found that the differences were extremely small so the consistency between each sample was guaranteed as minimum disturbance was made to the soil the samples can be regarded as undisturbed as indicated by song et al 2017 and xie et al 2018 in order to take account of the effects of initial water content on swcc three water content values were set at 5 10 and 15 the selection of three water contents is based on the following the natural water content of the soil in situ is around 4 75 5 25 so the first water content is selected as 5 to simulate the natural loess laboratory tests found that the plastic limit water content of heping loess is 15 42 15 48 so the upper limit of water content is selected as 15 to study the structural evolution of loess under the influence of seismic action near the plastic limit water content since the soil responses with initial moisture content of 5 and 15 after pre dynamic treatment are very different 10 was interpolated as the intermediate moisture content in the study to better determine the turning point the 10 and 15 samples were prepared as following according to the initial water content of the sample additional amount of water was dropped on the sample carefully with dropper then the samples were sealed with plastic wrap and allowed to cure for 7 days to ensure evenly distribution of moisture the uniform distribution of moisture was checked by measuring the water contents of random soil samples at top middle and bottom positions the results showed that for each sample the water contents at different positions were very similar with error less than 0 5 so the feasibility of this preparation method was confirmed then the samples were ready for pre dynamic loading tests 2 3 test method the pre dynamic loading was applied by the wf 12440 dynamic triaxial apparatus which was manufactured by wykeham farrance ltd of britain before pre dynamic treatment the samples are required to be consolidated to restore the initial stress state the axial consolidation pressure σ1c is determined from the formation pressure of the in situ loess which is calculated from the overburden pressure above the sampling position the lateral consolidation pressure σ3c was determined through σ3c k0σ1c where the lateral consolidation ratio k0 is 0 59 for the soil obtained from k0 tests wang et al 2011 liu et al 2020a following the above calculation procedure the axial pressure was set at 136 kpa and the confining pressure was set at 80 kpa the anisotropic consolidation was regarded as completed when the axial deformation of the sample had stabilized the parameters of pre dynamic loads were selected based on the real situation in sampling area based on the consideration that the seismic predominant frequencies are in the nature range between 1 and 5 hz and that seismic field inherent period of foundation soils of interest in engineering investigations is about 0 1 1 s in general liu et al 2020a b the frequency of 1 hz is adopted for continuous sinusoidal load during pre dynamic loading according to the seismic ground motion parameters zoning map of china gb 2015 and the code for seimic design of buildings in china gb 2010 the peak ground acceleration abbreviated as pga hereafter in sampling area is 0 15 0 40 g where g is the gravimetric acceleration to consider the effects of pga on swcc pga gradients of 0 00 g 0 15 g 0 30 g and 0 40 g are set in this study the shear strength τ c at given pga can be determined by using the equation proposed by seed and idriss 1971 1 τ c 0 65 a h m a x g σ v γ d where a h m a x is the maximum horizontal ground acceleration g is the gravimetric acceleration σ v is the total vertical stress γ d is the reduction factor which can be empirically obtained from table 3 then the dynamic loading σ d is expressed as 2 σ d 2 τ c during pre dynamic treatment a h m a x is equal to the applied pga gradient namely 0 00 g 0 15 g 0 30 g and 0 40 g respectively given that the bulk density of heping loess is 1388 kg m3 and the sampling depth is 6 m by using equations 1 and 2 the corresponding pre dynamic loads for designed pga gradients are 0 kpa 15 51 kpa 31 02 kpa and 41 36 kpa respectively in summary after the anisotropic consolidation was completed the soil samples would undergo pre dynamic treatment by applying cyclic loading at 0 00 g 0 15 g 0 30 g and 0 40 g respectively with sinusoidal wave frequency of 1 hz to ensure the comparability between different dynamic load groups same cycles 30 cycles in specific were applied for each pre dynamic load the schematic of pre dynamic load for cyclic loading at 0 15 g 0 30 g and 0 40 g is presented in fig 3 after pre dynamic treatment the samples were saturated inside the triaxial apparatus and then carefully dissembled from the equipment cut and transferred into a containing ring with 50 mm diameter and 20 mm height the entire process is carefully operated to minimize disturbance of the specimen and the duplicate samples are set to ensure the reliability of the experimental results the samples were then tested in a pressure plate chamber to determine the soil water characteristic curve the main principle of the pressure plate method is to use a high air entry value porous ceramic plate to maintain a pressure difference on both sides of the plate by means of axis translation technique namely the pore water pressure uw within the plate and the air pressure ua applied externally saturated samples are then placed on the porous plate to allow the pore fluid to be drained through the plate driven by the pressure difference at equilibrium the soil cakes resting on the plate will possess a value of matric suction equivalent to the difference between the ua and uw then the water content of the samples at this state is determined each air pressure is applied for at least 7 days which proved sufficient for reaching equilibrium after applying a series of air pressures and measuring the corresponding water contents the swcc data are obtained it should be noted that for each group of soil samples that is soil samples with different initial moisture contents and pga treatments duplicate experiments are set up to ensure the reliability of test results after the pressure plate data are plotted they are simulated and analyzed then numerous formulas have been proposed to mathematically present the soil water characteristic curve in geotechnical and geological engineering field the most popular ones include brooks and corey model 1964 van genuchten model 1980 and fredlund and xing model 1994 which are abbreviated as bc model vg model and fx model for simple description bc model is one of the earliest and simplest equation for swcc but this empirical expression is only applicable to coarse grained soils at relatively low suction ranges in comparison vg model has a strong physical and theoretical basis by taking account of the pore size distribution of soil and it is suitable for a wide range of soil types over the entire suction range fx model is similar to vg model and developed by further modifying the pore size distribution function provided by van genuchten 1980 considering the validity yet simplicity van genuchten model is adopted in this study to simulate the experimental data which is expressed as 3 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 a s n m where θ r and θ s are residual and saturated volumetric water content respectively which can be easily obtained from swcc data a n and m are model parameters which are related to the inverse of air entry value pore size distribution of soil and the overall symmetry of the soil water characteristic curve respectively these parameters can be determined by fitting the swcc experimental data the remaining soil samples were freeze dried to achieve dehydration while keeping the soil structure unchanged delage et al 1982 then mip and sem tests were conducted on the dried samples the mip test can obtain quantitative data of the change in the number of pores with different pore sizes in the rock and soil but it cannot reflect the specific change pattern of pores and the change in the contact mode of particles inside the soil in contrast the sem test can obtain a plane photo of the microstructure of the sample and provide more intuitive observation of the change in the pore patterns and particle contact mode inside the sample therefore combining the two methods the whole picture of the microstructural alteration can be better depicted mip tests were carried out by using auto pore 9510 which was manufactured by micromeritics and the sem tests were conducted with kyky 2008b apparatus 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 soil responses to pre dynamic loading treatment the stress strain curves of samples with different initial water content under different pga treatment are shown in fig 4 which reflect the different responses of soil at different hydraulic states to the seismic action in general under the same water content condition the axial strain increases with the increase of pga and under the same pga condition the axial strain increases with the increase of water content when both the water content and the pga value are low the regularity of the stress strain relationship curve is poor within the limited strain change the data show significant fluctuations with the increase of water content and especially the increase of pga the fluctuation of the curve decreases and becomes smooth at this time with the progress of the dynamic load cycle the soil sample undergoes significant axial strain but as the number of cycles continues to increase the amount of strain gradually tends to be constant the test has achieved good results in line with the expectation in order to better understand the changes of the soil samples caused by the pre dynamic load treatment the basic parameters including void ratio volumetric strain specific gravity before and after the dynamic load treatment are presented first when the initial water content is 5 and the pga is 0 15g 0 30g and 0 40g the axial strain of the undisturbed loess sample is around 0 019 0 189 when the moisture content of the loess samples increase from 5 to 10 and 15 the axial strain of the samples increases by 8 40 times after experiencing the same pre dynamic load the specific data are shown in table 4 3 2 effects of pre dynamic loading on swcc the experimental data obtained from pressure plate test and corresponding simulation result by using van genuchten model 1980 are presented in figs 5 7 denoted by separated symbols and continuous dash lines respectively since there are many groups of samples involved in the test in order to avoid mess and confusion the soil samples with the same initial moisture content are plotted in one graph also the average of the two parallel samples is taken when the final data is presented so that the results are more reliable and more concise the results show that the change of swcc of the soil samples with the initial water content of 5 was completely opposite to that of the 10 and 15 groups after undergoing pre dynamic loads for the 5 group the swccs shifted downward after pre dynamic treatment which implied that under the condition of same matric suction the water content of the soil sample decreased that is the water retention capacity of the soil decreased with the increase of the dynamic load used in the pre dynamic treatment i e the increase of the pga the swcc moved down further in contrast the swccs of soil samples in the 10 and 15 groups moved upward after the same pre dynamic treatment that is to say under the condition of same water content the soil sample after pre dynamic treatment had a larger suction value in other words the water retention capacity of the soil sample was enhanced the magnitude of the upward movement of the swcc increased with the increase of the pga moreover the swccs of the 10 group were more compact than that of the 15 group indicating that pga had a greater effect on loess samples with higher initial moisture content combining the data from the three groups it can be seen that the loess with different initial moisture content showed different responses after pre dynamic treatment soil samples with lower initial water content tended to be loose while those with higher water content became dense after seismic loading and it can also be predicted from the test result that the turning point water content was between 5 and 10 in order to better understand the swcc responses of soil samples with different initial water contents under the same pga condition the test results were also presented in the fig 8 it should be noted that 0 00 g corresponded to the reference group without pre dynamic treatment it can be seen from the fig 8 a that the swcc of soil samples without pre dynamic treatment was basically the same irrespective of different initial moisture contents many researches indicate that swcc depends on void ratio and soil fabric vanapalli et al 1999 ng and pang 2000 miller et al 2008 for the samples without pre dynamic treatment the void ratio and soil structure remained basically undisturbed during the sample preparation process as described before so the swcc did not change significantly this experimental result was in line with the findings in literature it can be seen from the remaining subplots b d that after experiencing the same pga the swccs of loess sample with different initial water contents were different and with the increase of pga the difference between swcc was also enlarged in general soil samples with higher initial water content had higher swcc distribution position after the same pre dynamic load treatment which meant that at the same matric suction value the soil had higher water content or say at the same water content the soil had higher matric suction in other words soil samples with higher initial water content had higher water retention capacity after the same pre dynamic treatment this implies that the swcc of loess that has experienced earthquake disturbances in history will change according to the water content at that time which will also affect the interaction between loess and subsequent infiltrating moisture as well as the stress state in the soil thereby affecting the soil responses including liquefaction that occur during subsequent earthquakes another important parameter that can be extracted from the soil water characteristic curve is the air entry value which is obtained by the intersection of the near horizontal straight line segment in the saturated part of swcc and the steep straight linear segment in the middle part of the swcc the air entry values derived from the experimental data were summarized in fig 9 it can be seen from the figure that the aev of the 5 group decreased gradually with the increase of pga while the aev of the 10 and 15 groups increased with the increasing pga this change was also consistent with the overall change pattern of swcc according to the equation 3 different air entry values will lead to different effective stress on the soil skeleton when subjected to same matric suction thus affecting the performance of the soil during the earthquake in addition comparing the experimental data and the fitting results good consistency was found and the fitting variances of all curves were greater than 0 99 which confirms that van genuchten model was applicable to heping loess investigated in this study and can be used to predict the relationship between water content and matric suction 3 3 effects of pre dynamic loading on loess structure 3 3 1 mip test results mip test results are presented in fig 10 which describe the volume of mercury intrusion per gram of soil sample at different pore size and the volume of mercury intrusion is equal to the volume of penetrated pores fig 10 a shows the pore size changes of the samples with 5 initial water content under the dynamic load with pga of 0 00 g 0 15 g 0 30 g and 0 40 g respectively it can be seen from the figure that there were two dominant peaks in the pore volume number curve of loess samples indicating two types of pores namely macropores and micropores the pore diameter distribution range of main peak was 80 537 113 180 µm while the distribution range of secondary peak existed between 0 324 and 0 954 µm with the increase of pga the number of large pore volumes in loess increased accordingly which was reflected by a rightward shift of the main peak in comparison the change of micropores was relatively small with the increase of pga the pore size of micropores increased slightly but the number of pore volumes was almost unchanged due to the larger number and proportion of macropores in the loess the pore size increased as a whole with the increase of pga in general fig 10 b and c show the pore size distribution of undisturbed loess samples with initial moisture content of 10 and 15 after pretreatment with different pga dynamic loads double porosity phenomenon was also observed for all samples however contrary to the 5 group after pretreatment with different pga dynamic loads the number of macropores in the loess samples began to decrease for both 10 and 15 groups which was indicated by a leftward movement of the main peak featured with pore diameter of 80 521 100 645 µm the micro porosity unsurprisingly showed insignificant change similar to the 5 group therefore on the whole after the soil samples with higher initial moisture content were subjected to dynamic load the pore size of the soil decreased and the structure became more compact numerous studies on the microstructure of clayey soils in the literature prove that the particle distribution of cohesive soils often contains bimodal or multimodal patterns i e double structure or double porosity and external loads can only affect the macropores portion pusch 1982 lloret et al 2003 sanchez et al 2005 castellanos et al 2008 romero et al 2011 musso et al 2013 mokni et al 2014 manca et al 2015 the bimodal curve obtained in this experiment as well as the weak response of micropores under dynamic loading are consistent with the previous research results 3 3 2 sem test results sem test results are shown in figs 11 13 grouped according to the initial moisture content as illustrated by the pictures the samples without pre dynamic treatment were similar irrespective of different initial water content the particles had clear boundaries and there were large pores between the particles without small particles filling in the similarity among non treated samples in sem observation was consistent with the aforementioned swcc results for the 5 initial water content group it can be seen from the sem pictures that the loess samples showed obvious seismic damage zones after pre dynamic loading the seismic damage zone referred to the phenomenon in which the pores inside the loess sample were connected to form larger pores under the action of dynamic load usually in the form of strips with the increase of pga the scale of the seismic damage zone in the loess sample began to expand and the number also began to increase this observation corresponded to the mip results for the loess sample groups with initial water contents of 10 and 15 the sem picture showed that the number of macropores in the loess began to decrease after pre dynamic loading the pores between large particles were obviously filled with smaller particles also with the increase of pga particle stacking and rearrangement occurred in some areas which resulted in a denser arrangement between soil particles in comparison the soil particles of the 15 group were relatively denser after pre dynamic treatment 3 4 influence of swcc changes on soil properties earthquake induced liquefaction is closely related to the initial stress state of soil skeleton as well as the subsequent moisture infiltration and these factors are highly dependent on and reflected by soil water characteristic curve swcc swcc describes the interaction between air and liquid phase in unsaturated soils and plays key role in determining the effective stress model parameters of elasto plastic constitutive equation and permeability coefficient based on a large number of experimental results the most widely accepted expression of effective stress extended for unsaturated soil takes the form proposed by bishop 1959 and bishop and blight 1963 4 σ σ u a χ u a u w in which σ is the effective stress u a and u w are pore air pressure and pore water pressure respectively χ is the effective stress parameter which describes the attribution of matric suction to effective stress and it takes the value of 1 for saturated soils and 0 for completely dry soils appropriate determination of effective stress parameter χ is critical to define the effective stress khalili and khabbaz 1998 investigated a large set of shearing test data from different soils in literature and proposed an equation for χ linking it with the air entry value of air expulsion value of soils which can be obtained from the swcc the equation is given as 5 χ 1 f o r s s e 1 s s e 0 55 f o r 1 s s e 12 where s is the actual matric suction existing in soil s e is the suction value separating the saturated and unsaturated states which are often denoted as air entry value or air expulsion value according to hydraulic path the soil traces this formula was improved by khalili et al 2004 and russell and khalili 2006 to extend the suction ratio greater than 25 after suitable mathematical determination of the swcc the permeability coefficient for unsaturated soils is then able to be obtained via statistical models which are rigorous and have strong physical basis in unsaturated soil permeability coefficient is not constant and it is a function of water content and pore size distribution moreover the experimental determination is time consuming and difficult therefore it is preferable to obtain the coefficient statistically based on swcc fredlund et al 1994 leong and rahardjo 1997 lu and likos 2003 for example among the commonly used models the one proposed by fredlund and xing 1994 is given as 6 k r w s s r s 10 6 s s r y s r s y 2 s r y s d y 10 6 s s r y 1 y 2 s r y s d y where y is a dummy variable of integration s e is the air entry suction s r s is the degree of saturation at the given value of suction and s r s s is the slope of the swcc 3 5 discussion combined with the mip and sem test results the observation of the microstructure showed that the macropores increased after pre dynamic loading for samples with initial water content of 5 while the macropores decreased after the same treatment for 10 and 15 groups this is because when the water content is low the soil particles mainly resist external forces through the internal friction under the action of dynamic loads rigid friction and occlusion occurs between the particles which lead to the interconnection of pores in the soil to form larger cavities the dislocation and displacement of particles under seismic action also destroy the cementation between particles as a result the pores in the loess begin to connect and the pore connectivity of the entire sample is enhanced such that this reduces the water retention capacity when the water content increases the water in the soil can play a lubricating role so that the cohesion starts to play a dominant role the soil samples are then able to be rearranged under the dynamic loads and the small particles are more likely to be filled into the gaps between the large particles with the moisture movement thus forming a denser structure and the overall pore connectivity inside the loess sample decreases also the contact mode between particles is transformed to oriented arrangement zuo et al 2020 yu et al 2021 yan et al 2022 yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 the above effects jointly led to a more compact soil structure such that an increase of water retention capacity occurred with the variaiton in density or porosity of soils after seismic load the pore size of voids will change accordingly the relationship between pore size and matric suction can be expressed as follows by using a capillary tube model 7 s u a u w 2 t s r c o s α where s is matric suction u a u w are air pressure and pore water pressure respectively t s is the surface tension r radius of capillary tube and α is the contact angle between water and soil particle for other more complicated models this similar inverse relationship between s and r can be found from the formation mechanism of matric suction it is known that swcc is controlled by soil structure since the soil structure and pore volume are closely related there is an indirect relationship between them in summary denser soil with smaller porosity and pore diameter will have greater matric suction stronger water retention and a higher distribution of swcc conversely looser soil with larger porosity and pore diameter will have lower matric suction weaker water retention and a lower distribution of swcc the intuitive observation results of the microstructure tests are consistent with the change of swcc the increase of macropores will reduce the water retention capacity of the loess soil while the water retention capacity of it will be enhanced if soil structure gets denser after pre dynamic treatment in addition the conclusions drawn in this paper are also in good agreement with the study of liu et al 2020a b on the effects of pre dynamic loads on static and dynamic liquefaction of undisturbed loess from a practical point of view when loess in nature experiences small earthquakes in the early stage if the moisture content in the soil is high a more stable soil structure can be achieved through vibration and the resistance of the loess to subsequent strong earthquakes can be improved on the contrary if the soil water content is low at that time the soil structure will be damaged due to vibration and the overall structure of the soil will become loose with fracture channels that are conducive to the infiltration of subsequent water thus showing poor stability in subsequent strong earthquakes wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 pei et al 2017 liu et al 2020a b 4 conclusions this paper aims to investigate the impact of pre dynamic loads on the soil water characteristic curve swcc of undisturbed loess through a series of comprehensive experiments the obtained results demonstrate a satisfactory level of agreement with the expected outcomes the findings indicate that both the initial water content of soil samples and the magnitude of pre dynamic loads significantly affect the swcc moreover the changing trend of the swcc may be diametrically opposite when different initial water contents are considered these results suggest that pre dynamic loads and initial water content should be carefully considered when analyzing the swcc of undisturbed loess the experimental results indicate that the impact of dynamic loads on the swcc of undisturbed loess is contingent upon the initial moisture content of the soil sample specifically when the initial moisture content is low the application of dynamic loads results in a downward shift of the swcc which is evidenced by a reduction in the soil sample s water retention capacity and air entry value conversely when the initial moisture content is high dynamic loading induces an upward shift of the swcc which is characterized by an increase in the soil sample s water retention capacity and air entry value notably the magnitude of the influence is positively correlated with the peak ground acceleration pga of the dynamic load the present study employs mip and sem tests to investigate the microstructural changes of undisturbed loess samples under dynamic loading the obtained results reveal that the impact of dynamic loading on the internal structure of the soil varies depending on the initial moisture content of the samples specifically for soil samples with low initial moisture content dynamic loading leads to the disruption of the internal structure resulting in a seismic damage zone and a trend of looser structure in contrast for loess samples with high initial moisture content dynamic loading causes the soil structure to become denser due to the induced vibration it is notable that the observed microstructural changes are consistent with the conclusions drawn from the swcc experiments providing reasonable explanations for the observed phenomena declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

1784,the frequent earthquakes in the loess area and the geological disasters induced by them have caused huge threats to the safety and property of the local residents and most disasters are highly dependent on moisture in the soils in this study the effects of pre dynamic loading on the hydraulic properties of loess are investigated through the variation of soil water characteristic curves which control the interaction between soil and moisture the results are analyzed based on the combination of mercury intrusion porosimetry mip and scanning electron microscope sem tests which reveal the influence of pre dynamic loads on microstructure for a more comprehensive understanding it is found that both the initial water content of soil samples and the magnitude of applied pre dynamic loads have impacts on soil water characteristic curve swcc when initial moisture content is low the dynamic load causes the loess structure to form a seismic damage zone resulting in downward movement of swcc and a reduction in the air entry value when the moisture content is high the soil structure gets denser after vibration leading to reversed influence for both cases the effect increases as the pga amplitude increases the outcomes of different experiments have achieved good agreement keywords pre dynamic treatment loess swcc microstructure mip sem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction early and mainstream studies on seismic liquefaction mainly focused on granular soil howells et al 1976 castro and poulos 1980 mohamad and dobry 1986 iwasaki 1986 bouckovalas et al 2003 tasiopoulou et al 2019 beyzaei et al 2020 to name a few but in recent years the liquefaction of clayey soil has also received increasing attention due to the disasters caused by frequent earthquakes around the loess areas ishihara et al 1990 huang et al 2019 huie et al 2019 in the loess plateau of china the earthquake induced disasters such as liquefaction seismic depressions landslides mudslides and collapses caused severe losses of life and property in history for example magnitude 8 5 haiyuan earthquake in 1920 the most catastrophic earthquake in loess area caused a series of landslides triggered by loess liquefaction at the expense of more than 100 000 lives more recently the magnitude 5 8 yondeng earthquake in 1995 caused 14 deaths 533 injuries and many house collapses another catastrophic earthquake magnitude 8 0 wenchuan earthquake in 2008 which caused 69 227 deaths 17 923 missing and enormous house collapses also resulted in a large number of loess disasters due to the proximity of hypocenter to the loess plateau based on this some researchers devoted their time to the study of clay liquefaction wang et al 2007 conducted the ring shear tests on saturated silt soil mixed with loess and they suggested that the shearing band was vulnerable to liquefaction under undrained condition and an increase in loess content caused a decrease in the peak shear strength and residual strength of the mixture xu et al 2012 also indicated that the cracks developed on the terrace behind the slope formed the dominant channels for water infiltration after in situ investigation zhou et al 2014a b carried out shearing tests on saturated loess and observed obvious dilation and contraction during undrained tests accompanied by increasing pore pressure which finally resulted in the liquefaction zhang et al 2017 conducted consolidated undrained triaxial tests to investigate the shear behavior of saturated loess and confirmed that excess pore water pressure was the key factor affecting the stability of loess landslides peng et al 2019 proposed a hydrological response of loess slopes based on widespread landslide events and suggested that if the bottom layer of loess slope was saturated by irrigation water the static liquefaction was experienced although these research outcomes have made great progress they mainly concentrated on the shearing resistance of loess and soil response during the liquefaction while the investigation about the effects of pre dynamic loads on loess properties is less from a historical point of view earthquakes in seismic zones often take place with multiple events occurring over a short period time which leads to the impact of early earthquakes on the soil response to subsequent earthquakes in other words most of the natural slopes in the seismic zone are not in the most primitive state they have experienced large or small earthquakes in the historical process thus reaching the current stable state therefore it is of theoretical and practical significance to understand the impact of pre dynamic loads on soil many investigations have been conducted to study the pre dynamic responses of cohesionless soil such as sands ecemis et al 2015 ertek and demir 2017 karakan et al 2019 but similar work on clayey soils are less in comparison liu et al 2020a b furthermore the effects of pre dynamic loading on the soil water characteristic curve abbreviated as swcc hereafter are scarce in literature however swcc constitutes a pivotal factor in characterizing the interplay between water and matric suction and is indicative of the soil s water retention capacity typically the curve is presented as a plot of the logarithm of either matric suction or total suction against either the degree of saturation the gravimetric water content or the volumetric water content the swcc encompasses the soil s behavior as it transitions from an initial unsaturated state to a saturated liquefaction state and given that water is a primary factor in earthquake induced geological disasters comprehending the changes in swcc under pre dynamic loading conditions holds practical significance in the analysis and prevention of such disasters it is notable that the water retention capacity discussed in this paper is not equal to the total amount water that can be stored in soil but the amount of water that soil can hold at different hydraulic states i e at different unsaturated states furthermore the swcc plays a crucial role in determining the effective stress parameter χ which is essential in evaluating the effective stress of unsaturated soil given that soil in its natural state is predominantly unsaturated its effective stress and corresponding alterations upon encountering water are closely associated with the swcc the fundamental mechanism of liquefaction involves the gradual accumulation of excess pore water pressure which ultimately diminishes the effective stress of the soil skeleton to zero resulting in the loss of its resistance capacity and its subsequent flow like a liquid hence a precise determination of the initial effective stress prior to seismic loading or water infiltration is imperative to accurately describe the occurrence of liquefaction moreover swcc is critical in the determination of permeability coefficient of unsaturated soils which controls the infiltration process the damage evolution of loess structure dominates the change of mechanical properties and the impact of earthquakes on loess can be fully reflected in the microstructure evolution loess microstructure includes particle contact mode and pore morphology structural changes occur under earthquakes and the evolution of internal structures leads to macroscopic geological disasters such as collapse landslide and mud flow pei et al 2017 liu et al 2020a wu et al 2020 the early earthquake causes the saturated low plastic silt to liquefy directly after the liquefaction the silt is consolidated under the action of self weight stress when the overlying load changes the consolidation stress ratio will be different and new structures will be formed which leads to important impact on the soil response when it experiences another earthquake in the later stage gao 1996 jiang et al 2014 therefore understanding the evolution of microstructure is of great significance to the hydraulic state in loess in this investigation emphasis is given to the effects of pre dynamic loading on the soil water characteristic curve of loess to fill the gap in this field and the results are analyzed and supplemented from the microscopic perspective by mercury intrusion mercury intrusion porosimetry mip test and scanning electron microscope sem observation 2 material and methods 2 1 material the loess used in the study was sampled from heping town lanzhou city china which is located on the fourth terrace of the yellow river the sampling position was around 6 0 m below the ground surface sampling location is illustrated in fig 1 after the soil samples were dug out they were carefully stored in sealed containers and then transferred to laboratory for tests basic geotechnical tests were conducted on the undisturbed soil to obtain the properties of the loess including natural moisture content density specific gravity plastic and liquid limits and particle size distribution in addition mineral compositions of the loess are analyzed and quantified through xrd tests the basic physical properties of the sampled loess are listed in table 1 and the main mineral compositions and corresponding percentages are shown in table 2 the particle size distribution curve is presented in fig 2 2 2 sample preparation in order to restore the properties of the in situ loess as much as possible the experiments were all carried out on the undisturbed loess specimens specifically the soil blocks sampled from the site were roughly cut into cylinders with diameter of 60 80 mm and height of 120 130 mm and then the cylinders were clamped within the soil cutting device the soil cylinder was fixed in the center of the device but allowed to rotate and the distance from the cutting plane to the center or designed diameter of the trimmed sample was controlled by a movable rod by rotating the soil sample and trimming it at a fixed shear plane a soil column with a predetermined diameter can be obtained finally standard triaxial sample with size of 50 100 mm is obtained by measuring the density and water content of several random samples prepared by above method it was found that the differences were extremely small so the consistency between each sample was guaranteed as minimum disturbance was made to the soil the samples can be regarded as undisturbed as indicated by song et al 2017 and xie et al 2018 in order to take account of the effects of initial water content on swcc three water content values were set at 5 10 and 15 the selection of three water contents is based on the following the natural water content of the soil in situ is around 4 75 5 25 so the first water content is selected as 5 to simulate the natural loess laboratory tests found that the plastic limit water content of heping loess is 15 42 15 48 so the upper limit of water content is selected as 15 to study the structural evolution of loess under the influence of seismic action near the plastic limit water content since the soil responses with initial moisture content of 5 and 15 after pre dynamic treatment are very different 10 was interpolated as the intermediate moisture content in the study to better determine the turning point the 10 and 15 samples were prepared as following according to the initial water content of the sample additional amount of water was dropped on the sample carefully with dropper then the samples were sealed with plastic wrap and allowed to cure for 7 days to ensure evenly distribution of moisture the uniform distribution of moisture was checked by measuring the water contents of random soil samples at top middle and bottom positions the results showed that for each sample the water contents at different positions were very similar with error less than 0 5 so the feasibility of this preparation method was confirmed then the samples were ready for pre dynamic loading tests 2 3 test method the pre dynamic loading was applied by the wf 12440 dynamic triaxial apparatus which was manufactured by wykeham farrance ltd of britain before pre dynamic treatment the samples are required to be consolidated to restore the initial stress state the axial consolidation pressure σ1c is determined from the formation pressure of the in situ loess which is calculated from the overburden pressure above the sampling position the lateral consolidation pressure σ3c was determined through σ3c k0σ1c where the lateral consolidation ratio k0 is 0 59 for the soil obtained from k0 tests wang et al 2011 liu et al 2020a following the above calculation procedure the axial pressure was set at 136 kpa and the confining pressure was set at 80 kpa the anisotropic consolidation was regarded as completed when the axial deformation of the sample had stabilized the parameters of pre dynamic loads were selected based on the real situation in sampling area based on the consideration that the seismic predominant frequencies are in the nature range between 1 and 5 hz and that seismic field inherent period of foundation soils of interest in engineering investigations is about 0 1 1 s in general liu et al 2020a b the frequency of 1 hz is adopted for continuous sinusoidal load during pre dynamic loading according to the seismic ground motion parameters zoning map of china gb 2015 and the code for seimic design of buildings in china gb 2010 the peak ground acceleration abbreviated as pga hereafter in sampling area is 0 15 0 40 g where g is the gravimetric acceleration to consider the effects of pga on swcc pga gradients of 0 00 g 0 15 g 0 30 g and 0 40 g are set in this study the shear strength τ c at given pga can be determined by using the equation proposed by seed and idriss 1971 1 τ c 0 65 a h m a x g σ v γ d where a h m a x is the maximum horizontal ground acceleration g is the gravimetric acceleration σ v is the total vertical stress γ d is the reduction factor which can be empirically obtained from table 3 then the dynamic loading σ d is expressed as 2 σ d 2 τ c during pre dynamic treatment a h m a x is equal to the applied pga gradient namely 0 00 g 0 15 g 0 30 g and 0 40 g respectively given that the bulk density of heping loess is 1388 kg m3 and the sampling depth is 6 m by using equations 1 and 2 the corresponding pre dynamic loads for designed pga gradients are 0 kpa 15 51 kpa 31 02 kpa and 41 36 kpa respectively in summary after the anisotropic consolidation was completed the soil samples would undergo pre dynamic treatment by applying cyclic loading at 0 00 g 0 15 g 0 30 g and 0 40 g respectively with sinusoidal wave frequency of 1 hz to ensure the comparability between different dynamic load groups same cycles 30 cycles in specific were applied for each pre dynamic load the schematic of pre dynamic load for cyclic loading at 0 15 g 0 30 g and 0 40 g is presented in fig 3 after pre dynamic treatment the samples were saturated inside the triaxial apparatus and then carefully dissembled from the equipment cut and transferred into a containing ring with 50 mm diameter and 20 mm height the entire process is carefully operated to minimize disturbance of the specimen and the duplicate samples are set to ensure the reliability of the experimental results the samples were then tested in a pressure plate chamber to determine the soil water characteristic curve the main principle of the pressure plate method is to use a high air entry value porous ceramic plate to maintain a pressure difference on both sides of the plate by means of axis translation technique namely the pore water pressure uw within the plate and the air pressure ua applied externally saturated samples are then placed on the porous plate to allow the pore fluid to be drained through the plate driven by the pressure difference at equilibrium the soil cakes resting on the plate will possess a value of matric suction equivalent to the difference between the ua and uw then the water content of the samples at this state is determined each air pressure is applied for at least 7 days which proved sufficient for reaching equilibrium after applying a series of air pressures and measuring the corresponding water contents the swcc data are obtained it should be noted that for each group of soil samples that is soil samples with different initial moisture contents and pga treatments duplicate experiments are set up to ensure the reliability of test results after the pressure plate data are plotted they are simulated and analyzed then numerous formulas have been proposed to mathematically present the soil water characteristic curve in geotechnical and geological engineering field the most popular ones include brooks and corey model 1964 van genuchten model 1980 and fredlund and xing model 1994 which are abbreviated as bc model vg model and fx model for simple description bc model is one of the earliest and simplest equation for swcc but this empirical expression is only applicable to coarse grained soils at relatively low suction ranges in comparison vg model has a strong physical and theoretical basis by taking account of the pore size distribution of soil and it is suitable for a wide range of soil types over the entire suction range fx model is similar to vg model and developed by further modifying the pore size distribution function provided by van genuchten 1980 considering the validity yet simplicity van genuchten model is adopted in this study to simulate the experimental data which is expressed as 3 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 a s n m where θ r and θ s are residual and saturated volumetric water content respectively which can be easily obtained from swcc data a n and m are model parameters which are related to the inverse of air entry value pore size distribution of soil and the overall symmetry of the soil water characteristic curve respectively these parameters can be determined by fitting the swcc experimental data the remaining soil samples were freeze dried to achieve dehydration while keeping the soil structure unchanged delage et al 1982 then mip and sem tests were conducted on the dried samples the mip test can obtain quantitative data of the change in the number of pores with different pore sizes in the rock and soil but it cannot reflect the specific change pattern of pores and the change in the contact mode of particles inside the soil in contrast the sem test can obtain a plane photo of the microstructure of the sample and provide more intuitive observation of the change in the pore patterns and particle contact mode inside the sample therefore combining the two methods the whole picture of the microstructural alteration can be better depicted mip tests were carried out by using auto pore 9510 which was manufactured by micromeritics and the sem tests were conducted with kyky 2008b apparatus 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 soil responses to pre dynamic loading treatment the stress strain curves of samples with different initial water content under different pga treatment are shown in fig 4 which reflect the different responses of soil at different hydraulic states to the seismic action in general under the same water content condition the axial strain increases with the increase of pga and under the same pga condition the axial strain increases with the increase of water content when both the water content and the pga value are low the regularity of the stress strain relationship curve is poor within the limited strain change the data show significant fluctuations with the increase of water content and especially the increase of pga the fluctuation of the curve decreases and becomes smooth at this time with the progress of the dynamic load cycle the soil sample undergoes significant axial strain but as the number of cycles continues to increase the amount of strain gradually tends to be constant the test has achieved good results in line with the expectation in order to better understand the changes of the soil samples caused by the pre dynamic load treatment the basic parameters including void ratio volumetric strain specific gravity before and after the dynamic load treatment are presented first when the initial water content is 5 and the pga is 0 15g 0 30g and 0 40g the axial strain of the undisturbed loess sample is around 0 019 0 189 when the moisture content of the loess samples increase from 5 to 10 and 15 the axial strain of the samples increases by 8 40 times after experiencing the same pre dynamic load the specific data are shown in table 4 3 2 effects of pre dynamic loading on swcc the experimental data obtained from pressure plate test and corresponding simulation result by using van genuchten model 1980 are presented in figs 5 7 denoted by separated symbols and continuous dash lines respectively since there are many groups of samples involved in the test in order to avoid mess and confusion the soil samples with the same initial moisture content are plotted in one graph also the average of the two parallel samples is taken when the final data is presented so that the results are more reliable and more concise the results show that the change of swcc of the soil samples with the initial water content of 5 was completely opposite to that of the 10 and 15 groups after undergoing pre dynamic loads for the 5 group the swccs shifted downward after pre dynamic treatment which implied that under the condition of same matric suction the water content of the soil sample decreased that is the water retention capacity of the soil decreased with the increase of the dynamic load used in the pre dynamic treatment i e the increase of the pga the swcc moved down further in contrast the swccs of soil samples in the 10 and 15 groups moved upward after the same pre dynamic treatment that is to say under the condition of same water content the soil sample after pre dynamic treatment had a larger suction value in other words the water retention capacity of the soil sample was enhanced the magnitude of the upward movement of the swcc increased with the increase of the pga moreover the swccs of the 10 group were more compact than that of the 15 group indicating that pga had a greater effect on loess samples with higher initial moisture content combining the data from the three groups it can be seen that the loess with different initial moisture content showed different responses after pre dynamic treatment soil samples with lower initial water content tended to be loose while those with higher water content became dense after seismic loading and it can also be predicted from the test result that the turning point water content was between 5 and 10 in order to better understand the swcc responses of soil samples with different initial water contents under the same pga condition the test results were also presented in the fig 8 it should be noted that 0 00 g corresponded to the reference group without pre dynamic treatment it can be seen from the fig 8 a that the swcc of soil samples without pre dynamic treatment was basically the same irrespective of different initial moisture contents many researches indicate that swcc depends on void ratio and soil fabric vanapalli et al 1999 ng and pang 2000 miller et al 2008 for the samples without pre dynamic treatment the void ratio and soil structure remained basically undisturbed during the sample preparation process as described before so the swcc did not change significantly this experimental result was in line with the findings in literature it can be seen from the remaining subplots b d that after experiencing the same pga the swccs of loess sample with different initial water contents were different and with the increase of pga the difference between swcc was also enlarged in general soil samples with higher initial water content had higher swcc distribution position after the same pre dynamic load treatment which meant that at the same matric suction value the soil had higher water content or say at the same water content the soil had higher matric suction in other words soil samples with higher initial water content had higher water retention capacity after the same pre dynamic treatment this implies that the swcc of loess that has experienced earthquake disturbances in history will change according to the water content at that time which will also affect the interaction between loess and subsequent infiltrating moisture as well as the stress state in the soil thereby affecting the soil responses including liquefaction that occur during subsequent earthquakes another important parameter that can be extracted from the soil water characteristic curve is the air entry value which is obtained by the intersection of the near horizontal straight line segment in the saturated part of swcc and the steep straight linear segment in the middle part of the swcc the air entry values derived from the experimental data were summarized in fig 9 it can be seen from the figure that the aev of the 5 group decreased gradually with the increase of pga while the aev of the 10 and 15 groups increased with the increasing pga this change was also consistent with the overall change pattern of swcc according to the equation 3 different air entry values will lead to different effective stress on the soil skeleton when subjected to same matric suction thus affecting the performance of the soil during the earthquake in addition comparing the experimental data and the fitting results good consistency was found and the fitting variances of all curves were greater than 0 99 which confirms that van genuchten model was applicable to heping loess investigated in this study and can be used to predict the relationship between water content and matric suction 3 3 effects of pre dynamic loading on loess structure 3 3 1 mip test results mip test results are presented in fig 10 which describe the volume of mercury intrusion per gram of soil sample at different pore size and the volume of mercury intrusion is equal to the volume of penetrated pores fig 10 a shows the pore size changes of the samples with 5 initial water content under the dynamic load with pga of 0 00 g 0 15 g 0 30 g and 0 40 g respectively it can be seen from the figure that there were two dominant peaks in the pore volume number curve of loess samples indicating two types of pores namely macropores and micropores the pore diameter distribution range of main peak was 80 537 113 180 µm while the distribution range of secondary peak existed between 0 324 and 0 954 µm with the increase of pga the number of large pore volumes in loess increased accordingly which was reflected by a rightward shift of the main peak in comparison the change of micropores was relatively small with the increase of pga the pore size of micropores increased slightly but the number of pore volumes was almost unchanged due to the larger number and proportion of macropores in the loess the pore size increased as a whole with the increase of pga in general fig 10 b and c show the pore size distribution of undisturbed loess samples with initial moisture content of 10 and 15 after pretreatment with different pga dynamic loads double porosity phenomenon was also observed for all samples however contrary to the 5 group after pretreatment with different pga dynamic loads the number of macropores in the loess samples began to decrease for both 10 and 15 groups which was indicated by a leftward movement of the main peak featured with pore diameter of 80 521 100 645 µm the micro porosity unsurprisingly showed insignificant change similar to the 5 group therefore on the whole after the soil samples with higher initial moisture content were subjected to dynamic load the pore size of the soil decreased and the structure became more compact numerous studies on the microstructure of clayey soils in the literature prove that the particle distribution of cohesive soils often contains bimodal or multimodal patterns i e double structure or double porosity and external loads can only affect the macropores portion pusch 1982 lloret et al 2003 sanchez et al 2005 castellanos et al 2008 romero et al 2011 musso et al 2013 mokni et al 2014 manca et al 2015 the bimodal curve obtained in this experiment as well as the weak response of micropores under dynamic loading are consistent with the previous research results 3 3 2 sem test results sem test results are shown in figs 11 13 grouped according to the initial moisture content as illustrated by the pictures the samples without pre dynamic treatment were similar irrespective of different initial water content the particles had clear boundaries and there were large pores between the particles without small particles filling in the similarity among non treated samples in sem observation was consistent with the aforementioned swcc results for the 5 initial water content group it can be seen from the sem pictures that the loess samples showed obvious seismic damage zones after pre dynamic loading the seismic damage zone referred to the phenomenon in which the pores inside the loess sample were connected to form larger pores under the action of dynamic load usually in the form of strips with the increase of pga the scale of the seismic damage zone in the loess sample began to expand and the number also began to increase this observation corresponded to the mip results for the loess sample groups with initial water contents of 10 and 15 the sem picture showed that the number of macropores in the loess began to decrease after pre dynamic loading the pores between large particles were obviously filled with smaller particles also with the increase of pga particle stacking and rearrangement occurred in some areas which resulted in a denser arrangement between soil particles in comparison the soil particles of the 15 group were relatively denser after pre dynamic treatment 3 4 influence of swcc changes on soil properties earthquake induced liquefaction is closely related to the initial stress state of soil skeleton as well as the subsequent moisture infiltration and these factors are highly dependent on and reflected by soil water characteristic curve swcc swcc describes the interaction between air and liquid phase in unsaturated soils and plays key role in determining the effective stress model parameters of elasto plastic constitutive equation and permeability coefficient based on a large number of experimental results the most widely accepted expression of effective stress extended for unsaturated soil takes the form proposed by bishop 1959 and bishop and blight 1963 4 σ σ u a χ u a u w in which σ is the effective stress u a and u w are pore air pressure and pore water pressure respectively χ is the effective stress parameter which describes the attribution of matric suction to effective stress and it takes the value of 1 for saturated soils and 0 for completely dry soils appropriate determination of effective stress parameter χ is critical to define the effective stress khalili and khabbaz 1998 investigated a large set of shearing test data from different soils in literature and proposed an equation for χ linking it with the air entry value of air expulsion value of soils which can be obtained from the swcc the equation is given as 5 χ 1 f o r s s e 1 s s e 0 55 f o r 1 s s e 12 where s is the actual matric suction existing in soil s e is the suction value separating the saturated and unsaturated states which are often denoted as air entry value or air expulsion value according to hydraulic path the soil traces this formula was improved by khalili et al 2004 and russell and khalili 2006 to extend the suction ratio greater than 25 after suitable mathematical determination of the swcc the permeability coefficient for unsaturated soils is then able to be obtained via statistical models which are rigorous and have strong physical basis in unsaturated soil permeability coefficient is not constant and it is a function of water content and pore size distribution moreover the experimental determination is time consuming and difficult therefore it is preferable to obtain the coefficient statistically based on swcc fredlund et al 1994 leong and rahardjo 1997 lu and likos 2003 for example among the commonly used models the one proposed by fredlund and xing 1994 is given as 6 k r w s s r s 10 6 s s r y s r s y 2 s r y s d y 10 6 s s r y 1 y 2 s r y s d y where y is a dummy variable of integration s e is the air entry suction s r s is the degree of saturation at the given value of suction and s r s s is the slope of the swcc 3 5 discussion combined with the mip and sem test results the observation of the microstructure showed that the macropores increased after pre dynamic loading for samples with initial water content of 5 while the macropores decreased after the same treatment for 10 and 15 groups this is because when the water content is low the soil particles mainly resist external forces through the internal friction under the action of dynamic loads rigid friction and occlusion occurs between the particles which lead to the interconnection of pores in the soil to form larger cavities the dislocation and displacement of particles under seismic action also destroy the cementation between particles as a result the pores in the loess begin to connect and the pore connectivity of the entire sample is enhanced such that this reduces the water retention capacity when the water content increases the water in the soil can play a lubricating role so that the cohesion starts to play a dominant role the soil samples are then able to be rearranged under the dynamic loads and the small particles are more likely to be filled into the gaps between the large particles with the moisture movement thus forming a denser structure and the overall pore connectivity inside the loess sample decreases also the contact mode between particles is transformed to oriented arrangement zuo et al 2020 yu et al 2021 yan et al 2022 yu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 the above effects jointly led to a more compact soil structure such that an increase of water retention capacity occurred with the variaiton in density or porosity of soils after seismic load the pore size of voids will change accordingly the relationship between pore size and matric suction can be expressed as follows by using a capillary tube model 7 s u a u w 2 t s r c o s α where s is matric suction u a u w are air pressure and pore water pressure respectively t s is the surface tension r radius of capillary tube and α is the contact angle between water and soil particle for other more complicated models this similar inverse relationship between s and r can be found from the formation mechanism of matric suction it is known that swcc is controlled by soil structure since the soil structure and pore volume are closely related there is an indirect relationship between them in summary denser soil with smaller porosity and pore diameter will have greater matric suction stronger water retention and a higher distribution of swcc conversely looser soil with larger porosity and pore diameter will have lower matric suction weaker water retention and a lower distribution of swcc the intuitive observation results of the microstructure tests are consistent with the change of swcc the increase of macropores will reduce the water retention capacity of the loess soil while the water retention capacity of it will be enhanced if soil structure gets denser after pre dynamic treatment in addition the conclusions drawn in this paper are also in good agreement with the study of liu et al 2020a b on the effects of pre dynamic loads on static and dynamic liquefaction of undisturbed loess from a practical point of view when loess in nature experiences small earthquakes in the early stage if the moisture content in the soil is high a more stable soil structure can be achieved through vibration and the resistance of the loess to subsequent strong earthquakes can be improved on the contrary if the soil water content is low at that time the soil structure will be damaged due to vibration and the overall structure of the soil will become loose with fracture channels that are conducive to the infiltration of subsequent water thus showing poor stability in subsequent strong earthquakes wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 pei et al 2017 liu et al 2020a b 4 conclusions this paper aims to investigate the impact of pre dynamic loads on the soil water characteristic curve swcc of undisturbed loess through a series of comprehensive experiments the obtained results demonstrate a satisfactory level of agreement with the expected outcomes the findings indicate that both the initial water content of soil samples and the magnitude of pre dynamic loads significantly affect the swcc moreover the changing trend of the swcc may be diametrically opposite when different initial water contents are considered these results suggest that pre dynamic loads and initial water content should be carefully considered when analyzing the swcc of undisturbed loess the experimental results indicate that the impact of dynamic loads on the swcc of undisturbed loess is contingent upon the initial moisture content of the soil sample specifically when the initial moisture content is low the application of dynamic loads results in a downward shift of the swcc which is evidenced by a reduction in the soil sample s water retention capacity and air entry value conversely when the initial moisture content is high dynamic loading induces an upward shift of the swcc which is characterized by an increase in the soil sample s water retention capacity and air entry value notably the magnitude of the influence is positively correlated with the peak ground acceleration pga of the dynamic load the present study employs mip and sem tests to investigate the microstructural changes of undisturbed loess samples under dynamic loading the obtained results reveal that the impact of dynamic loading on the internal structure of the soil varies depending on the initial moisture content of the samples specifically for soil samples with low initial moisture content dynamic loading leads to the disruption of the internal structure resulting in a seismic damage zone and a trend of looser structure in contrast for loess samples with high initial moisture content dynamic loading causes the soil structure to become denser due to the induced vibration it is notable that the observed microstructural changes are consistent with the conclusions drawn from the swcc experiments providing reasonable explanations for the observed phenomena declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
