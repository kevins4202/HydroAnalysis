860,to maintain a navigable channel and improve high flow conveyance engineers have recently proposed constructing longitudinal training walls as an alternative to the traditional transverse groynes however previous work has shown that the system of parallel channels created by a longitudinal training wall might be unstable in rivers with alternate bars many questions remain unanswered particularly whether a stable system can be obtained by carefully designing the bifurcation point this work analyses the stability of the bifurcating system created by a thin longitudinal wall in sand bed rivers with alternate bars or point bars the methodology includes performing 102 numerical tests using the delft3d code to reproduce an idealized low land river either straight or meandering the results show that the system of parallel channels separated by a training wall may indeed become unstable an important factor is found to be the location of the bifurcation point with respect to a neighboring bar or point bar the same trends are observed for both constant and variable discharge in straight and meandering channels the results suggest that cyclic growth and decline of the bifurcating channels may arise as inherent system behavior without the need of any additional external forcing we explain this from changes in the relationship between sediment transport ratio and discharge ratio as the bifurcation evolves this cyclic behavior can be regarded as a form of system stability and can be obtained by carefully placing the starting point of the longitudinal training wall and thus the bifurcation point near the top of a bar keywords longitudinal training wall river morphology river bars bifurcation channel stability delft3d 1 background and objective lowland rivers have been trained for centuries with transverse groynes to prevent bank erosion and to improve and maintain a navigable channel longitudinal training walls are less commonly applied but they can serve the same purposes in the netherlands series of transverse groynes have been built to prevent ice jams during the winter and improve channel navigability by channel narrowing fig 1 a the large scale narrowing of the rhine branches along with bend cutoffs and sediment mining triggered a morphological response of incision at rates up to over 2 cm year apart from draining riparian habitats in floodplains and undermining hydraulic structures this incision also deteriorated the conditions for navigation to mitigate these effects groynes in the river waal near tiel were replaced by longitudinal training walls in the years 2013 2015 as a pilot for testing this alternative approach to river training fig 1b the main idea was to provide a narrow and hence deep main channel during low flows while allowing more water to flow in the secondary channel behind the training wall at higher discharges in order to reduce main channel erosion and to lower the water levels during floods furthermore the presence of the secondary channel was expected to improve the ecological conditions of the river finally the fairway would no longer be spoiled by the shallow ridges that develop in response to the formation of local scour holes at groyne heads another pertinent example is the quang ngai irrigation system in central vietnam which was built in the period 1985 1997 in the framework of the thach nham project it comprises two main intakes upstream and many small free inlets further downstream along both sides of the tra khuc river during the dry season the main low flow stream sways inside the main channel changing location every year fig 2 this creates the need to guarantee water flow to the intakes without hindering the water conveyance during the rainy season two solutions are proposed to solve the problem the first one is to move the intakes to other locations where the main stream is more stable the second solution proposes constructing longitudinal training walls along the river banks in the reach with the intakes this solution is expected to be more easily accepted by the local community since it would not change the old channel system and the land use along the river therefore longitudinal training walls appear as a promising solution to clear the entrances of water inlets and intakes along the tra khuc river a longitudinal training wall divides a river in two parallel channels usually having different widths with an upstream bifurcation as river bifurcations are often unstable the question arises whether the two channel system will be stable and in case of instability which channel would silt up the pattern of steady bars in the river can be assumed to be a major factor for this stability because bars influence the sediment distribution between the two channels de heer and mosselman 2004 redolfi et al 2016 le et al 2018 we address this question in the present research by carrying out a long series of numerical tests using the delft3d code considering that this code has already proven to be successful in simulating the morphological development of this type of systems le et al 2018 the objective is to assess the stability of the channels on either side of a longitudinal training wall in single thread sand bed rivers with steady or slowly migrating alternate bars or point bars several cases are considered different locations of the bifurcation point with respect to a bar or point bar different channel widths constant and variable discharges as well as straight and sinuous channels 2 theoretical background 2 1 stability of bifurcations and bars bifurcation stability depends on the flow and sediment transport in the upper reaches of the branches below the bifurcation if more sediment enters the branch than the flow can transport the branch will experience sedimentation if less sediment enters the bed of the branch will erode if the amount of sediment entering each branch is exactly equal to the transport capacity of the flow the bifurcation is in equilibrium this equilibrium is stable if it is restored after a small perturbation e g if occasional erosion in a branch generates sediment overloading producing counteracting sedimentation it is unstable if the small perturbation grows further for instance if occasional erosion in a branch generates a shortage of sediment entering this branch giving rise to further erosion the stability of a bifurcation is therefore governed by the interplay between the distributions of water and sediment between the two branches these distributions depend on the structure of flow and sediment transport in the area immediately upstream of the bifurcation most alluvial rivers have wavy channel beds due to the presence of bars fig 3 this makes the structure of flow and sediment transport complex bars are associated with lateral flow redistribution transverse bed slopes and helical flow that alter the sediment transport direction struiksma et al 1985 these features affect the distribution of sediment at bifurcations bertoldi and tubino 2007 the presence of a bar and in particular a steady bar redolfi et al 2016 le et al 2018 might therefore lead to the silting up and closure of one of the two parallel channels divided by the longitudinal wall bars develop due to either morphodynamic instability occurring at sufficiently large width to depth ratios or morphodynamic forcing or both the bars that arise from morphodynamic instability are called free bars these bars are typically periodic and can migrate in downstream or in upstream direction zolezzi and seminara 2001 zolezzi et al 2005 mosselman et al 2006 the linear stability analyses carried out since the 1970s show that a flat alluvial bed may develop into a pattern of alternate or multiple bars unstable bed depending on the flow width to depth ratio and other morphodynamic parameters e g hansen 1967 callander 1969 engelund 1970 engelund and skovgaard 1973 parker 1976 fredsøe 1978 zolezzi and seminara 2001 showed that free bars migrate in downstream direction if the flow width to depth ratio is smaller than the resonant one sub resonant conditions and in upstream direction if it is larger super resonant conditions at resonant conditions free bars present zero celerity notwithstanding the presence of simplifying assumptions such as a constant discharge the results of these analyses are successfully used as physics based predictors of the alluvial channel pattern e g parker 1976 lanzoni 2000 crosato and mosselman 2009 morphodynamic forcing is the result of permanent flow curvature that arises from a local change of channel geometry which can be caused by a bend a structure and a local width change curved flow results in outer bend scour and inner bend sediment deposition typical forced bars are the point bars that become visible during low flows at the inner side of river bends forcing can also fix the location of free bars struiksma et al 1985 struiksma and crosato 1989 such bars with zero celerity can give rise to a more extensive pattern of periodic non migrating sediment deposits these deposits are called hybrid bars because they depend on both forcing and morphodynamic instability duró et al 2015 recent theoretical analyses show that steady bars may arise upstream of the bifurcation point as a result of the perturbation generated by the start of the longitudinal wall if the original channel exceeds the width to depth ratio that allows for upstream morphodynamic influence i e is at super resonant conditions redolfi et al 2016 forced and hybrid bars are rather common in low land rivers since natural channels are generally irregular resulting in numerous forcings and this is why the presence of these bars is considered central in this study 2 2 bifurcation stability analyses non linear phase plane stability analyses of one dimensional bifurcation models by flokstra 1985 and wang et al 1995 show how sensitive bifurcations are to the distribution of sediment transport these analyses use simple hypothetical relationships in which the ratio of sediment transports into the two branches is a function of the ratios of discharges and widths of the two branches 1 q s 1 q s 2 q 1 q 2 k b 1 b 2 1 k where q s1 and q s2 are the sediment transport rates entering branch 1 and 2 respectively q 1 and q 2 are the water discharges b 1 and b 2 are the channel widths and k is a number that has to be determined empirically for low values of k this relation is destabilizing because a higher discharge into one branch would generate a higher stabilizing sediment input but an even higher destabilizing sediment throughput due to the nonlinear relation between sediment transport capacity and discharge the stabilizing effect of the higher sediment input prevails only if k is sufficiently large wang et al 1995 found that bifurcations are stable both channels remain open for k 5 3 and unstable one of the channels silts up for k 5 3 if the sediment transport capacity is computed with engelund and hansen s 1967 formula which is valid for sand bed rivers in principle 2d and 3d models can be used to calculate the distribution of sediment transport into the branches of a bifurcation in 1d models however the 2d and 3d details of flow and sediment transport at the bifurcation are lost several researchers attempted to improve the relationships for sediment transport distribution over bifurcated branches in 1d models by accounting in a parameterized way for various mechanisms that may play a role fig 4 bolla pittaluga et al 2003 extended wang et al 1995 formula by incorporating transverse flows due to the redistribution of discharges over the cross section and by incorporating the effects of transverse bed slope in the final reach of the upstream channel with normal width flow discharge and sediment transport rate equal to b0 q 0 and q s0 respectively the additions by bolla pittaluga et al 2003 imply that more sediment is transported towards the largest and deepest channel downstream they thus have a stabilizing effect indeed bolla pittaluga et al 2003 found that for low values of the flow width to depth ratio and large values of the shields parameter of the flow symmetrical bifurcation geometries are stable as the width to depth ratio increases or the shields number decreases this configuration loses stability de heer and mosselman 2004 commented that the relationship of bolla pittaluga et al 2003 does not account for upstream asymmetries such as the presence of bars they expressed the expectation that an extension with more mechanisms of sediment distribution would reveal that bifurcations can be unstable under more conditions than suggested by the analysis of bolla pittaluga et al 2003 such extensions were proposed subsequently by kleinhans et al 2008 bertoldi et al 2009 and van der mark and mosselman 2013 bertoldi et al 2009 included the effect of migrating bars according to relations by colombini et al 1987 for free alternate bars that occur in long straight channels with uniform width bars arriving at the bifurcation feed the downstream branches alternatingly with a larger amount of water and sediment the time period of this feeding is set by the ratio between bar length and migration speed as a result the bifurcation oscillates around an equilibrium or disappears due to closure of one of the branches the findings of bertoldi et al 2009 do not hold however for the point bars and hybrid steady bars that are encountered more generally in rivers than free bars kleinhans et al 2008 added the effects of helical flow in upstream river bends to the sediment distribution relation of bolla pittaluga et al 2003 by modifying the direction of the sediment transport affected by transverse slope however the transverse bed slope is still calculated from the elevation difference between the bed levels in the downstream branches not from the topography of the upstream point bar that is formed in alluvial river bends van der mark and mosselman 2013 proposed a relationship for the effects of helical flow in which the streamline curvature generating this helical flow is related to redistribution of the flow over the cross section rather than related to an upstream river bend they tested their relationship as well as other relationships against field data concluding that all relationships perform poorly and that reliable models of river bifurcations should be at least two dimensional systematic 2d numerical simulations by kleinhans et al 2008 shed more light on the effects of different sediment distribution mechanisms on bifurcation stability unstable bifurcations can be nearly balanced if mechanisms favoring the closure of one channel are compensated by mechanisms favoring the closure of the other channel such nearly balanced bifurcations develop more slowly than unbalanced bifurcations furthermore the numerical simulations showed the sediment distribution relationships to change as a bifurcation evolves in this way an initially unstable bifurcation may become stable in a strongly asymmetrical configuration without reaching full closure of the declining branch 3 numerical investigations 3 1 model description we analysed the results of a large number of 2d numerical simulations reproducing the behavior of an idealized low land river with alternate bars or point bars which is divided into two parallel channels by a thin longitudinal wall the delft3d code solves the three dimensional reynolds equations for incompressible fluid and shallow water with a finite difference scheme deltares 2014 a variety of sediment transport formulas is available to compute the sediment transport rate bed level changes are derived by either applying the exner principle bed load or fast adapting suspended load or from a sediment balance equation in which sediment deposition and entrainment rates are derived as a function of suspended solid concentrations and hydrodynamic parameters the models developed in the framework of this study were based on the depth averaged version of the basic equations 2d approach defina 2003 schuurman et al 2013 duró et al 2015 and singh et al 2017 demonstrated that this type of approach is able to simulate bar processes with sufficient accuracy the approach is also supported by the experience of le et al 2018 who successfully reproduced the long term morphological developments of this type of systems at the laboratory scale with a 2d model built using the delft3d code 3 2 model setup we selected values of the hydraulic and morphological variables and parameters that represent a typical lowland river with alternate bars or point bars such variables and parameters were inspired by the waal river in the netherlands fig 1 and are listed in table 1 the computational case however is not a scaled version of the waal river since the two systems differ for instance in the value of the shields parameter fig 5 shows part of the numerical grids 45 km total length for the straight and the sinuous channel the rectangular grid size being 15 45 m2 straight channel in all models b0 b1 b2 where b 0 is the original river width b 1 is the side smaller channel width and b 2 is the main larger channel width three width combinations are investigated including the scenario in which b1 b2 in the curved channel the wavelength of the meanders along the straight line connecting their inflection points was chosen to be equal to the equilibrium hybrid bar wavelength 1350 m the meander amplitude was equal to 100 m the hydrodynamic boundary conditions of the models consisted of downstream water level and upstream discharge these boundary conditions were either constant most scenarios with a discharge of 200 m3 s or variable the discharge hydrograph adopted in the variable discharge scenarios was inspired by the waal river table 1 the typical hydrological year is depicted in fig 6 the boundary conditions for the sediment component were upstream balanced sediment transport which prevented the bed level from changing at the boundary and a downstream free sediment transport condition which allows undisturbed level changes up to the boundary the banks were kept fixed and treated as free slip boundaries the morphodynamic conditions of the simulated system correspond to a river channel with alternate bars the theoretical mode m is the integer representing the type of bars that form in the river channel it was here computed according to crosato and mosselman s 2009 theory the value m 1 table 1 refers to alternate bars applying the linear theory both the waal river at average discharge and the computational case result in super resonant conditions but very close to resonance blondeaux and seminara 1985 in such a case a finite flow discontinuity near the upstream boundary leads to the formation of a series of hybrid alternate bars struiksma and crosato 1989 mosselman et al 2006 such a discontinuity was obtained in the straight channel simulations by placing a transverse thin dam obstructing 1 2 of the channel width at a distance of 900 m from the upstream boundary ten times the width of the channel b0 the sinuous channel simulations did not need an external disturbance to obtain the formation of point bars which spontaneously form at the inner side of bends the longitudinal training wall was schematized as a thin infinitely high and deep dam to ensure that the structure always divides the two channels even at the highest flow rates the bed roughness was represented by a constant chézy coefficient value in table 1 and the bed load transport rate was computed by means of the engelund hansen 1967 formula valid for sand bed rivers the bed slope effect on sediment transport direction was taken into account in all simulations mosselman and le 2016 two formulations were considered bagnold s 1966 default in delft3d and koch and flokstra s 1981 koch and flokstra s formulation was adopted solely for the sensitivity analysis meant to study the effects of transverse bed slope on bifurcation stability since it allows having a stronger vs smaller effect of transverse bed slope on sediment transport direction by changing the value of one or more coefficients the influence of the spiral flow in curved reaches was accounted for according to the formulation of struiksma et al 1985 in delft3d the drying of wet cells is imposed based on a threshold water depth cells that become dry are removed from the hydro morphological computational domain and remain dry they may become wet again by bank erosion but this is not considered in our computations in our simulation this threshold water depth was 10 cm default in delft3d the time step of the flow computations was 0 5 min to ensure numerical stability and accuracy as evaluated by the criterion that the courant number is smaller than 10 the morphological developments in all simulations with constant discharge were accelerated by using a morphological acceleration factor mf equal to 10 after having checked that this does not affect the results in a way that is relevant for the scope of the study this approach is also justified because previous studies in river channels with similarly small froude numbers e g crosato et al 2011 duró et al 2015 showed that it hardly affects the development of the 2d bed topography in a river with hybrid bars for the simulations with variable discharge we did not accelerate the computations mf 1 as a result the running times were 10 years for all constant discharge scenarios with mf 10 and 100 years for the variable discharge scenarios with mf 1 this means that we computationally cover 100 years in all cases the computational time proved to be long enough to reach a new morphodynamic equilibrium characterized by negligible temporal changes of the average bed elevation of the parallel channels see chapter 4 table 2 summarizes the numerical parameters used in the simulations 3 3 model runs the investigation comprises 102 different model runs these are meant to study the effects on bifurcation stability of longitudinal wall starting point runs w 0 width ratio runs w 0 w 1 and w 2 and variable discharge runs v 0 v 1 and v 2 with different width ratios the investigation includes a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects on bifurcation stability of the deviation of bed load direction due to transverse bed slope runs a in addition four runs are carried out to study bifurcation stability in a sinuous channel runs s these are especially meant to investigate whether accounting for the effects of spiral flow on bed load direction may result in different morphological trends since spiral flow deviates bed load transport in opposite direction compared to transverse bed slope struiksma et al 1985 kleinhans et al 2008 ottevanger 2013 the performed simulations are listed in table 3 all scenarios included a reference case without longitudinal wall but with a transverse wall to generate the initial bed topography with alternate hybrid bars this bed topography is then the starting condition of all the other runs to study the influence of bars on the stability of the bifurcation created by the start of the longitudinal wall several starting locations were identified with respect to a selected steady bar fig 7 these locations are numbered from 1 to 18 location 18 corresponds to location 1 with respect to the next bar the effects of the starting location were then analysed for different width ratios namely b1 b2 1 5 w 0 base case scenario 1 2 w 1 and 1 1 w 2 see table 3 4 results 4 1 effects of starting location the 18 simulations reproducing the long term morphological developments of the base case scenario w0 runs with b1 b2 1 5 and constant discharge differ solely in the starting location of the longitudinal wall the results show that if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a steady bar i e at locations 3 7 the side channel silts up fig 8 b instead if the training wall starts in the downstream part of the bar i e at locations 11 17 the side channel deepens and it is the main channel that silts up in this case the side channel eventually conveys almost all the water discharge fig 8d a different morphodynamic behavior is observed if the training wall starts near the bar top at locations 8 10 in this case the results show a dynamic balance in which the side channel experiences cycles of erosion and sedimentation and remains open fig 8c every cycle comprises three steps fig 9 1 rise of side channel bed 2 bar formation near the upstream end of the side channel and side channel bed erosion 3 upstream bar erosion and return to the initial state these cycles repeat continuously during the 100 years covered by the computations the first cycle is illustrated in fig 9 the simulated systems were slightly super resonant at average flow in this case the perturbation caused by the starting of the longitudinal wall might affect the shape of the steady bars upstream redolfi et al 2016 however the obtained results do not always show upstream influence of the bifurcation point indeed when the training wall starts in the upstream part fig 8b or near the bar top fig 8c upstream bars do not show any changes compared to the reference case fig 8a when the training wall starts in the downstream part a bar deformation extends to a distance upstream of about 3 bar wavelengths fig 8d independently from the bifurcation point no bars formed upstream of the transverse forcing dam that was placed to generate the series of hybrid bars downstream not in the figures fig 10 a shows the temporal variations of the proportion of total discharge that flows in the side channel q1 q0 in some representative cases if q1 q0 0 all the discharge is conveyed by the main channel if q1 q0 1 all the discharge is conveyed by the side channel the fastest developments pertain to the cases in which the side channel becomes increasingly deep fig 10b shows the variations of sediment transport ratio versus discharge ratio during the computations the initial discharge ratio q 1 q 2 being about 1 8 this figure shows also theoretical sediment transport ratios as a function of q 1 q 2 for b1 b2 1 5 base case scenario computed using eq 1 wang et al 1995 in the logarithmic scale graph the values of the exponent k are represented by the slope of the straight lines according to wang et al the bifurcation is stable both channels remain open for k 5 3 and unstable one of the channels silts up for k 5 3 in case sediment transport capacity is governed by the formula of engelund and hansen 1967 this is the transport formula adopted in the simulations the application of wang et al s theory implies deriving the constant value of k by calibration for the performed numerical tests this would lead to the selection of a value of k within the instability conditions for most cases for location 10 however the numerical results show that the system assumes a dynamic balance in which it alternates between a stable bifurcation with a slope k in fig 10b that is steeper than 5 3 and an unstable bifurcation with a slope that is less than 5 3 temporal variations thus allow a limit cycle that is not a possible solution in the theoretical analysis of wang et al 1995 that uses a constant value of k this suggests that an oscillating distribution of discharges can arise as inherent system behavior not necessarily imposed by the alternating arrival of migrating bars from upstream as in hirose et al 2003 and bertoldi and tubino 2007 because in our system we do not have migrating bars at the longitudinal wall starting location this behaviour can be theoretically described only when allowing for temporal variations of k in wang et al 1995 formula eq 1 4 2 effects of altering the width ratio between side and main channel the results of the long term morphological simulations show that altering the width ratio does not change the final result the trends are the same as in the base case scenario fig 11 if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a hybrid bar the side channel silts up fig 11a instead if the training wall starts in the downstream part of the same bar the side channel deepens and the main channel aggrades fig 11c if the training wall starts near the bar top both channels remain open fig 11b fig 12 shows the temporal variations of the proportion of total discharge that flows in the side channel q1 q0 for various width ratios if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a bar the side channel silts up completely q1 q0 0 dash dot lines as seen in the previous section this happens for all considered width ratios except for b1 b2 1 1 side and main channel having equal width where the process is slower red line and does not result in complete closure of one of the channels if the training wall starts in the downstream part of a bar the side channel eventually conveys most water discharge dash lines it conveys 100 of the water main channel closure only for b1 b2 1 5 black line whereas the main channel remains open for the larger width ratios b1 b2 1 2 and b1 b2 1 1 however also in these cases the side channel still conveys the major part of the discharge with q1 q0 0 95 in the new equilibrium bars are not observable in the deeper channel whereas some low amplitude bars are present in the silting up channel they are the remains of bars that formed during the transition period when the training wall starts near the bar top both channels remain open continuous lines the larger the width ratio the more water flows through the side channel these results suggest that enlarging the width ratio increases the stability of the bifurcation in general the evolution with constant discharge is relatively fast when it does not reach a dynamic balance it reaches the dominant configuration in which one of the parallel channels silts up within the first 14 years 4 3 effects of variable discharge a set of runs was carried out to study the effects of variable discharge on bifurcation stability considering that flow variations can influence the bar location and geometry as well as the sediment distribution between the two channels as in the previous set of runs three different width ratios were considered b1 b2 1 5 base case scenario b1 b2 1 2 and b1 b2 1 1 the following three starting locations were analysed 4 upstream of bar top 10 bar top and 17 downstream of bar top see fig 7 the reference case with variable flow started with a flat bed the bars that formed after 100 years can be recognized from fig 13 showing their evolution during the tenth year due to discharge variations bars tend to disappear at peak discharge q 590 m3 s when the width to depth ratio is the minimum b h 15 at peak discharge low amplitude migrating bars are observable in the straight reach with the exception of a forced bar near the transverse wall and a strongly damped hybrid bar further downstream at the opposite side bars start to reform after the peak discharge since small amplitude bars are already visible at the end of the flood wave at a discharge of q 267 m3 s when the width to depth ratio has increased to b h 25 it can be observed that the small migrating bars are gradually suppressed by a series of longer hybrid bars forming downstream of the transverse wall after the period characterized by the average discharge q 200 m3 s the small migrating bars are still present and with larger amplitude they are further suppressed in the low discharge period q 151 m3 s the results show that the bar wave length increases whereas the bar amplitude decreases with the discharge this is valid for both hybrid and free migrating bars table 4 presents bar development under variable discharge the analysis of bar evolution shows that influenced by the forcing offered by the transverse wall the first bar on the right side is the most stable one and the second bar on the right side has some variations in shape due to variable discharge in order to observe clear effects of the variable discharge the starting locations of the training wall refer to the second bar on the right side starting the longitudinal wall near one of the most downstream and variable bars could lead to different conclusions the results of the simulations with the longitudinal wall starting from the bed topography at the end of the tenth year of the reference case show bed evolution trends that are similar to the cases with constant discharge fig 14 if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a steady bar the side channel silts up fig 14 a whereas if the training wall starts in the downstream part of the same bar the side channel deepens fig 14 c however if the training wall starts near the bar top the evolution is similar to the case in which the wall starts in the upstream part of the bar fig 14 shows the water depth at the end of the 100th year at low flow for different width ratios it might give the impression that one of the parallel channels always silts up completely but that is not true since the plots refer to the final bed configuration at low flow condition fig 15 shows the temporal evolution of the ratio of side channel discharge to total discharge q1 q0 during the first 30 years both channels remain open from the 31st year on both channels remain open during high flow whereas one of the channels closes during low flow the parallel channel system does not find a dynamic equilibrium as occurs with a constant discharge if the training wall starts at location 10 which is located at 2 2 km from the transverse wall fig 13 dash line the conveyance of the silting channel slowly diminishes with time to reach a constant value after 70 years this could be explained by the longitudinal variation of the reference bar shape due to variable discharge fig 13 the location of the initial bar top is situated in the upstream part of a bar during average to moderate discharge and in a pool at the highest discharge but for a relatively short duration 4 4 sensitivity analysis on the effects of transverse bed slope a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the dependence of bifurcation stability on transverse bed slope by increasing and decreasing its effects on sediment transport direction this was obtained in the model by applying koch and flokstra s 1981 formulation extended for the effect of bedforms according to which the function f θ is calculated as 3 f θ a s h θ b s h d h c s h where ash bsh and csh are calibration coefficients θ represents the shields parameter d is sediment size and h is the normal depth among the three parameters ash is the most sensitive one increasing the value of ash decreases the effects of transverse slope on sediment transport direction schuurman et al 2013 the value of ash normally falls in the range 0 5 1 5 and this is the range of values used for the sensitivity analysis whereas the values of the other calibration coefficients are kept constant bsh 0 5 and csh 0 3 talmon et al 1995 the numerical simulations show that starting from a flat bed different values of ash resulted in different bar characteristics analysing the values in table 5 we can observe that the bar wavelength increases if the bed slope effects increase decreasing ash whereas the opposite trend can be observed for the bar amplitude stronger bed slope effects result in smaller amplitudes based on the equilibrium state two locations for the starting point of the longitudinal training wall were selected location 4 in the upstream part of a bar and location 17 in the downstream part the results show that varying the effect of bed slope did not change the final configuration of the bifurcating channels a training wall starting at location 4 always resulted in side channel silt up whereas a training wall starting at location 17 always resulted in side channel erosion however stronger bed slope effects resulted in slower morphological evolution table 5 which is probably due to the smaller bar amplitude resulting in more equal sediment distribution between the channels 4 5 sinuous planform in this section the numerical simulations represent a sinuous channel with constant discharge of 200 m3 s in the reference case without longitudinal wall point bars naturally formed near the inner bank of bends fig 16 a the longitudinal training wall was set only after the point bars were fully formed three locations for its starting point were selected location 4 in the upstream part of a point bar location 10 near the bar top and location 17 in its downstream part the obtained final configurations are shown in fig 16 the results are similar to the ones obtained with a straight channel fig 8 indicating that the curvature of the channel and the presence of a relatively strong spiral flow ottevanger 2013 do not change the unstable character of the bifurcation created by a longitudinal training wall the results indicate that the effects of the spiral flow are less important for the sediment transport direction and the sediment distribution between side and main channel than the main flow deviation and the bed slope caused by the presence of the point bar at least in the cases examined 5 discussion in the previous sections attention was paid to rather schematized and idealized examples for more realistic applications a few aspects should be considered cell drying was obtained numerically in a rather straightforward way depending on an assigned critical local water depth we believe that the areas that become completely dry under constant discharge in the numerical simulations would still convey some water in reality the experimental study carried out by le et al 2018 supports this because aggrading channels were never found to silt up completely all tests were carried out with sediment transported as bed load the results might be different in presence of substantial amounts of suspended load this remains open for further research keeping a constant value of the bed roughness represented in the models by the chézy coefficient may have altered the dynamics of the system the bed roughness should be a function of water depth becoming gradually higher in the aggrading channel and lower in the deepening one similarly the bed roughness should vary with the discharge the numerical grid used in the computations contains six cells in the cross section because two dimensional aspects of water flow and sediment transport are important for bifurcation studies we also performed other computational tests not shown here with 18 cells the results of the finer grid confirmed the morphological developments obtained with the coarser grid for this reason we decided to use the coarser grid which allowed for the computation of many different scenarios in total 102 model runs an important issue in morphodynamic modelling is the use of a morphological factor mf which accelerates the bed development and decreases the computational time in this study we applied mf 10 but only for the cases with constant discharge after having checked that it does not affect the results in a relevant way to check this we performed a computation using mf 1 no morphological acceleration and obtained after 10 years results that did not differ when plotted in an observable way from the results of one year using mf 10 for variable discharge we represented the yearly hydrograph in a schematic way and performed the computation without any morphological acceleration in this way we could distinguish the yearly effects of the variable discharge in computations with a constant discharge the time corresponding to the morphological developments is merely theoretical using a morphological acceleration factor larger than 1 after having checked that it does not affect the results therefore does not affect the interpretation of the results since the link with time is not clear anyway with variable discharge especially if a yearly hydrograph is used applying a morphological acceleration factor larger than 1 creates an unclear distortion of time and hampers the interpretations of time developments for this reason we discourage the use of morphological acceleration in computations with variable discharge redolfi et al 2016 investigated the stability of a symmetrical bifurcation under steady flow conditions disregarding the presence of alternate bars in the main channel this symmetrical configuration becomes unstable if the original not yet bifurcated channel is at super resonant conditions because due to morphodynamics influence a steady alternate bar forms just upstream of the bifurcation point this bar tends to unbalance the flow and sediment partition between the bifurcating channels in the unsteady flow computations performed here the width to depth ratio falls below the critical value for bar formation during peak flows and for this reason bars tend to disappear fig 13 at the end of the flood wave hybrid bars are incipient and short migrating bars are present hybrid bars are fully developed after the low flow period although some bar irregularities are present due to the interactions with remains of free bars the conditions at average discharge occurring after the flood wave are close to resonance and at the lowest discharge the systems is super resonant according to zolezzi and seminara 2001 upstream morphodynamic influence may occur only at the lowest flow rates however we do not observe any steady bar interfering with hybrid bars near the bifurcation at the end of the low flow period this is a sign of possible hybrid bar dominance as a consequence we can conclude that upstream morphodynamic influence does not affect bifurcation stability at the conditions considered in this study hypothetically if super resonant conditions were present for a longer period i e also at higher discharges a steady bar might develop near the bifurcation in this case the stability of the channel system would be determined by the competition between the steady bar at the node and the hybrid bars in the channel further investigations are needed to show at which conditions one of the two would prevail 6 conclusions and recommendations this work addresses the stability of the system of two parallel channels separated by a longitudinal training wall the effects of hybrid steady alternate bars near the bifurcation point on their morphological evolution have been investigated by means of a 2d numerical model developed using the delft3d code the results of the numerical simulations show that the two channel system with a training wall along one side of the river tends to become unstable with the silting up of either the narrower side channel or the wider main channel these results are valid for both straight and sinuous channels with either constant or variable discharge the results of the numerical simulations show three final scenarios depending on the starting location of the longitudinal walls in the first scenario the training wall starts in the upstream part of a bar in this case all water flow eventually concentrates in the main channel and as a result the side channel gradually silts up in the second scenario the training wall starts in the downstream part of a bar in this case all water is eventually conveyed by the side channel and as a result the main channel gradually silts up if the training wall starts in a limited area near the bar top both channels reach a dynamic balance and remain open however this third scenario only occurs for constant discharge since discharge variability results in the silting up of one channel in this case too this is caused by the elongation and shortening of the bars that result from the discharge variations changing the widths of the parallel channels did not change the trends observed in the base case scenario the most stable system is obtained if the longitudinal wall subdivides the river in two equally wide parallel channels in this case the morphological process appears much slower than in the other cases and the channel characterized by bed level rise does not appear to silt up completely this study shows that in rivers with hybrid bars the position of the upstream end of the training wall plays an important role in the morphological development of the system our results indicate that the upstream end of a training wall is best located near the top of a bar this can be readily understood from the physical processes at the bifurcation bifurcation instability arises when the supply of sediment to a branch deviates from the transport capacity immediately downstream two factors play a role first this deviation between supply and transport capacity is smallest in river sections without streamwise gradients in flow field and bed topography where lateral exchanges are at a minimum such sections are found at bar tops and in bar troughs second deviations between sediment supply and transport capacity produce faster morphological changes in deeper areas where sediment transport is higher small deviations thus produce faster loss of stability in bar troughs than at bar tops that makes bar tops the most suitable locations for the bifurcation yet this does not guarantee stability in natural rivers where hybrid and point bars continuously change in length and position due to discharge variations claude et al 2014 which means that the location of the training wall relative to a bar continuously changes with time the upstream entrance of the side channel might therefore require an appropriate bank line configuration or a control structure to enforce a favorable location since the first hybrid bars near a forcing are the most stable ones discharge variations and the arrival of free migrating bars may produce cyclic growth and decay of bifurcated channels hirose et al 2003 bertoldi and tubino 2007 our findings suggest however that such cycles may also arise spontaneously as inherent system behavior if the development of bifurcated channels alters the relationship between sediment transport ratio and discharge ratio e g expressed as a change in k eq 1 the simulated systems were super resonant but close to resonant conditions blondeaux and seminara 1985 in this case steady bars may form also upstream of the bifurcation due to the flow perturbation caused by the start of the longitudinal wall redolfi et al 2016 the obtained results however do not always show upstream influence of the bifurcation point apart from a local bed deformation extending to a distance upstream on the order of magnitude of 3 bar wave lengths fig 8 no bars formed upstream of the transverse forcing wall that was placed to generate a series of hybrid bars downstream in general the evolution with constant discharge is faster than the evolution with variable discharge this is because with constant discharge location and size of the bar close to the bifurcation did not change and transported sediment was permanently deviated in the same way with variable discharge the bar tended to disappear during peak flows and the deviation of sediment towards the silting up channel was not always present in our numerical simulations when it does not reach a dynamic balance the final bed configuration is obtained within the first 14 years with variable discharges the final configuration is obtained after 70 years fig 15 this result suggests that in real rivers with natural discharges the morphological development after the construction of a longitudinal training wall may last for a long time the bifurcation formed by a longitudinal training wall is inherently unstable but we found the condition at which the morphological changes develop rather slowly which makes the bifurcation manageable as a result we recommend designing longitudinal training walls in such a way that the upstream starting point is located at the top of a bar the bar top location can be fixated by constructing a groyne or structure upstream if this is not possible the optimal location of the starting point could be obtained by carefully studying the variation in bar length due to discharge variability channel maintenance is minimized if the two channels have more or less the same width acknowledgment this work is sponsored by vietnam international education development vied

860,to maintain a navigable channel and improve high flow conveyance engineers have recently proposed constructing longitudinal training walls as an alternative to the traditional transverse groynes however previous work has shown that the system of parallel channels created by a longitudinal training wall might be unstable in rivers with alternate bars many questions remain unanswered particularly whether a stable system can be obtained by carefully designing the bifurcation point this work analyses the stability of the bifurcating system created by a thin longitudinal wall in sand bed rivers with alternate bars or point bars the methodology includes performing 102 numerical tests using the delft3d code to reproduce an idealized low land river either straight or meandering the results show that the system of parallel channels separated by a training wall may indeed become unstable an important factor is found to be the location of the bifurcation point with respect to a neighboring bar or point bar the same trends are observed for both constant and variable discharge in straight and meandering channels the results suggest that cyclic growth and decline of the bifurcating channels may arise as inherent system behavior without the need of any additional external forcing we explain this from changes in the relationship between sediment transport ratio and discharge ratio as the bifurcation evolves this cyclic behavior can be regarded as a form of system stability and can be obtained by carefully placing the starting point of the longitudinal training wall and thus the bifurcation point near the top of a bar keywords longitudinal training wall river morphology river bars bifurcation channel stability delft3d 1 background and objective lowland rivers have been trained for centuries with transverse groynes to prevent bank erosion and to improve and maintain a navigable channel longitudinal training walls are less commonly applied but they can serve the same purposes in the netherlands series of transverse groynes have been built to prevent ice jams during the winter and improve channel navigability by channel narrowing fig 1 a the large scale narrowing of the rhine branches along with bend cutoffs and sediment mining triggered a morphological response of incision at rates up to over 2 cm year apart from draining riparian habitats in floodplains and undermining hydraulic structures this incision also deteriorated the conditions for navigation to mitigate these effects groynes in the river waal near tiel were replaced by longitudinal training walls in the years 2013 2015 as a pilot for testing this alternative approach to river training fig 1b the main idea was to provide a narrow and hence deep main channel during low flows while allowing more water to flow in the secondary channel behind the training wall at higher discharges in order to reduce main channel erosion and to lower the water levels during floods furthermore the presence of the secondary channel was expected to improve the ecological conditions of the river finally the fairway would no longer be spoiled by the shallow ridges that develop in response to the formation of local scour holes at groyne heads another pertinent example is the quang ngai irrigation system in central vietnam which was built in the period 1985 1997 in the framework of the thach nham project it comprises two main intakes upstream and many small free inlets further downstream along both sides of the tra khuc river during the dry season the main low flow stream sways inside the main channel changing location every year fig 2 this creates the need to guarantee water flow to the intakes without hindering the water conveyance during the rainy season two solutions are proposed to solve the problem the first one is to move the intakes to other locations where the main stream is more stable the second solution proposes constructing longitudinal training walls along the river banks in the reach with the intakes this solution is expected to be more easily accepted by the local community since it would not change the old channel system and the land use along the river therefore longitudinal training walls appear as a promising solution to clear the entrances of water inlets and intakes along the tra khuc river a longitudinal training wall divides a river in two parallel channels usually having different widths with an upstream bifurcation as river bifurcations are often unstable the question arises whether the two channel system will be stable and in case of instability which channel would silt up the pattern of steady bars in the river can be assumed to be a major factor for this stability because bars influence the sediment distribution between the two channels de heer and mosselman 2004 redolfi et al 2016 le et al 2018 we address this question in the present research by carrying out a long series of numerical tests using the delft3d code considering that this code has already proven to be successful in simulating the morphological development of this type of systems le et al 2018 the objective is to assess the stability of the channels on either side of a longitudinal training wall in single thread sand bed rivers with steady or slowly migrating alternate bars or point bars several cases are considered different locations of the bifurcation point with respect to a bar or point bar different channel widths constant and variable discharges as well as straight and sinuous channels 2 theoretical background 2 1 stability of bifurcations and bars bifurcation stability depends on the flow and sediment transport in the upper reaches of the branches below the bifurcation if more sediment enters the branch than the flow can transport the branch will experience sedimentation if less sediment enters the bed of the branch will erode if the amount of sediment entering each branch is exactly equal to the transport capacity of the flow the bifurcation is in equilibrium this equilibrium is stable if it is restored after a small perturbation e g if occasional erosion in a branch generates sediment overloading producing counteracting sedimentation it is unstable if the small perturbation grows further for instance if occasional erosion in a branch generates a shortage of sediment entering this branch giving rise to further erosion the stability of a bifurcation is therefore governed by the interplay between the distributions of water and sediment between the two branches these distributions depend on the structure of flow and sediment transport in the area immediately upstream of the bifurcation most alluvial rivers have wavy channel beds due to the presence of bars fig 3 this makes the structure of flow and sediment transport complex bars are associated with lateral flow redistribution transverse bed slopes and helical flow that alter the sediment transport direction struiksma et al 1985 these features affect the distribution of sediment at bifurcations bertoldi and tubino 2007 the presence of a bar and in particular a steady bar redolfi et al 2016 le et al 2018 might therefore lead to the silting up and closure of one of the two parallel channels divided by the longitudinal wall bars develop due to either morphodynamic instability occurring at sufficiently large width to depth ratios or morphodynamic forcing or both the bars that arise from morphodynamic instability are called free bars these bars are typically periodic and can migrate in downstream or in upstream direction zolezzi and seminara 2001 zolezzi et al 2005 mosselman et al 2006 the linear stability analyses carried out since the 1970s show that a flat alluvial bed may develop into a pattern of alternate or multiple bars unstable bed depending on the flow width to depth ratio and other morphodynamic parameters e g hansen 1967 callander 1969 engelund 1970 engelund and skovgaard 1973 parker 1976 fredsøe 1978 zolezzi and seminara 2001 showed that free bars migrate in downstream direction if the flow width to depth ratio is smaller than the resonant one sub resonant conditions and in upstream direction if it is larger super resonant conditions at resonant conditions free bars present zero celerity notwithstanding the presence of simplifying assumptions such as a constant discharge the results of these analyses are successfully used as physics based predictors of the alluvial channel pattern e g parker 1976 lanzoni 2000 crosato and mosselman 2009 morphodynamic forcing is the result of permanent flow curvature that arises from a local change of channel geometry which can be caused by a bend a structure and a local width change curved flow results in outer bend scour and inner bend sediment deposition typical forced bars are the point bars that become visible during low flows at the inner side of river bends forcing can also fix the location of free bars struiksma et al 1985 struiksma and crosato 1989 such bars with zero celerity can give rise to a more extensive pattern of periodic non migrating sediment deposits these deposits are called hybrid bars because they depend on both forcing and morphodynamic instability duró et al 2015 recent theoretical analyses show that steady bars may arise upstream of the bifurcation point as a result of the perturbation generated by the start of the longitudinal wall if the original channel exceeds the width to depth ratio that allows for upstream morphodynamic influence i e is at super resonant conditions redolfi et al 2016 forced and hybrid bars are rather common in low land rivers since natural channels are generally irregular resulting in numerous forcings and this is why the presence of these bars is considered central in this study 2 2 bifurcation stability analyses non linear phase plane stability analyses of one dimensional bifurcation models by flokstra 1985 and wang et al 1995 show how sensitive bifurcations are to the distribution of sediment transport these analyses use simple hypothetical relationships in which the ratio of sediment transports into the two branches is a function of the ratios of discharges and widths of the two branches 1 q s 1 q s 2 q 1 q 2 k b 1 b 2 1 k where q s1 and q s2 are the sediment transport rates entering branch 1 and 2 respectively q 1 and q 2 are the water discharges b 1 and b 2 are the channel widths and k is a number that has to be determined empirically for low values of k this relation is destabilizing because a higher discharge into one branch would generate a higher stabilizing sediment input but an even higher destabilizing sediment throughput due to the nonlinear relation between sediment transport capacity and discharge the stabilizing effect of the higher sediment input prevails only if k is sufficiently large wang et al 1995 found that bifurcations are stable both channels remain open for k 5 3 and unstable one of the channels silts up for k 5 3 if the sediment transport capacity is computed with engelund and hansen s 1967 formula which is valid for sand bed rivers in principle 2d and 3d models can be used to calculate the distribution of sediment transport into the branches of a bifurcation in 1d models however the 2d and 3d details of flow and sediment transport at the bifurcation are lost several researchers attempted to improve the relationships for sediment transport distribution over bifurcated branches in 1d models by accounting in a parameterized way for various mechanisms that may play a role fig 4 bolla pittaluga et al 2003 extended wang et al 1995 formula by incorporating transverse flows due to the redistribution of discharges over the cross section and by incorporating the effects of transverse bed slope in the final reach of the upstream channel with normal width flow discharge and sediment transport rate equal to b0 q 0 and q s0 respectively the additions by bolla pittaluga et al 2003 imply that more sediment is transported towards the largest and deepest channel downstream they thus have a stabilizing effect indeed bolla pittaluga et al 2003 found that for low values of the flow width to depth ratio and large values of the shields parameter of the flow symmetrical bifurcation geometries are stable as the width to depth ratio increases or the shields number decreases this configuration loses stability de heer and mosselman 2004 commented that the relationship of bolla pittaluga et al 2003 does not account for upstream asymmetries such as the presence of bars they expressed the expectation that an extension with more mechanisms of sediment distribution would reveal that bifurcations can be unstable under more conditions than suggested by the analysis of bolla pittaluga et al 2003 such extensions were proposed subsequently by kleinhans et al 2008 bertoldi et al 2009 and van der mark and mosselman 2013 bertoldi et al 2009 included the effect of migrating bars according to relations by colombini et al 1987 for free alternate bars that occur in long straight channels with uniform width bars arriving at the bifurcation feed the downstream branches alternatingly with a larger amount of water and sediment the time period of this feeding is set by the ratio between bar length and migration speed as a result the bifurcation oscillates around an equilibrium or disappears due to closure of one of the branches the findings of bertoldi et al 2009 do not hold however for the point bars and hybrid steady bars that are encountered more generally in rivers than free bars kleinhans et al 2008 added the effects of helical flow in upstream river bends to the sediment distribution relation of bolla pittaluga et al 2003 by modifying the direction of the sediment transport affected by transverse slope however the transverse bed slope is still calculated from the elevation difference between the bed levels in the downstream branches not from the topography of the upstream point bar that is formed in alluvial river bends van der mark and mosselman 2013 proposed a relationship for the effects of helical flow in which the streamline curvature generating this helical flow is related to redistribution of the flow over the cross section rather than related to an upstream river bend they tested their relationship as well as other relationships against field data concluding that all relationships perform poorly and that reliable models of river bifurcations should be at least two dimensional systematic 2d numerical simulations by kleinhans et al 2008 shed more light on the effects of different sediment distribution mechanisms on bifurcation stability unstable bifurcations can be nearly balanced if mechanisms favoring the closure of one channel are compensated by mechanisms favoring the closure of the other channel such nearly balanced bifurcations develop more slowly than unbalanced bifurcations furthermore the numerical simulations showed the sediment distribution relationships to change as a bifurcation evolves in this way an initially unstable bifurcation may become stable in a strongly asymmetrical configuration without reaching full closure of the declining branch 3 numerical investigations 3 1 model description we analysed the results of a large number of 2d numerical simulations reproducing the behavior of an idealized low land river with alternate bars or point bars which is divided into two parallel channels by a thin longitudinal wall the delft3d code solves the three dimensional reynolds equations for incompressible fluid and shallow water with a finite difference scheme deltares 2014 a variety of sediment transport formulas is available to compute the sediment transport rate bed level changes are derived by either applying the exner principle bed load or fast adapting suspended load or from a sediment balance equation in which sediment deposition and entrainment rates are derived as a function of suspended solid concentrations and hydrodynamic parameters the models developed in the framework of this study were based on the depth averaged version of the basic equations 2d approach defina 2003 schuurman et al 2013 duró et al 2015 and singh et al 2017 demonstrated that this type of approach is able to simulate bar processes with sufficient accuracy the approach is also supported by the experience of le et al 2018 who successfully reproduced the long term morphological developments of this type of systems at the laboratory scale with a 2d model built using the delft3d code 3 2 model setup we selected values of the hydraulic and morphological variables and parameters that represent a typical lowland river with alternate bars or point bars such variables and parameters were inspired by the waal river in the netherlands fig 1 and are listed in table 1 the computational case however is not a scaled version of the waal river since the two systems differ for instance in the value of the shields parameter fig 5 shows part of the numerical grids 45 km total length for the straight and the sinuous channel the rectangular grid size being 15 45 m2 straight channel in all models b0 b1 b2 where b 0 is the original river width b 1 is the side smaller channel width and b 2 is the main larger channel width three width combinations are investigated including the scenario in which b1 b2 in the curved channel the wavelength of the meanders along the straight line connecting their inflection points was chosen to be equal to the equilibrium hybrid bar wavelength 1350 m the meander amplitude was equal to 100 m the hydrodynamic boundary conditions of the models consisted of downstream water level and upstream discharge these boundary conditions were either constant most scenarios with a discharge of 200 m3 s or variable the discharge hydrograph adopted in the variable discharge scenarios was inspired by the waal river table 1 the typical hydrological year is depicted in fig 6 the boundary conditions for the sediment component were upstream balanced sediment transport which prevented the bed level from changing at the boundary and a downstream free sediment transport condition which allows undisturbed level changes up to the boundary the banks were kept fixed and treated as free slip boundaries the morphodynamic conditions of the simulated system correspond to a river channel with alternate bars the theoretical mode m is the integer representing the type of bars that form in the river channel it was here computed according to crosato and mosselman s 2009 theory the value m 1 table 1 refers to alternate bars applying the linear theory both the waal river at average discharge and the computational case result in super resonant conditions but very close to resonance blondeaux and seminara 1985 in such a case a finite flow discontinuity near the upstream boundary leads to the formation of a series of hybrid alternate bars struiksma and crosato 1989 mosselman et al 2006 such a discontinuity was obtained in the straight channel simulations by placing a transverse thin dam obstructing 1 2 of the channel width at a distance of 900 m from the upstream boundary ten times the width of the channel b0 the sinuous channel simulations did not need an external disturbance to obtain the formation of point bars which spontaneously form at the inner side of bends the longitudinal training wall was schematized as a thin infinitely high and deep dam to ensure that the structure always divides the two channels even at the highest flow rates the bed roughness was represented by a constant chézy coefficient value in table 1 and the bed load transport rate was computed by means of the engelund hansen 1967 formula valid for sand bed rivers the bed slope effect on sediment transport direction was taken into account in all simulations mosselman and le 2016 two formulations were considered bagnold s 1966 default in delft3d and koch and flokstra s 1981 koch and flokstra s formulation was adopted solely for the sensitivity analysis meant to study the effects of transverse bed slope on bifurcation stability since it allows having a stronger vs smaller effect of transverse bed slope on sediment transport direction by changing the value of one or more coefficients the influence of the spiral flow in curved reaches was accounted for according to the formulation of struiksma et al 1985 in delft3d the drying of wet cells is imposed based on a threshold water depth cells that become dry are removed from the hydro morphological computational domain and remain dry they may become wet again by bank erosion but this is not considered in our computations in our simulation this threshold water depth was 10 cm default in delft3d the time step of the flow computations was 0 5 min to ensure numerical stability and accuracy as evaluated by the criterion that the courant number is smaller than 10 the morphological developments in all simulations with constant discharge were accelerated by using a morphological acceleration factor mf equal to 10 after having checked that this does not affect the results in a way that is relevant for the scope of the study this approach is also justified because previous studies in river channels with similarly small froude numbers e g crosato et al 2011 duró et al 2015 showed that it hardly affects the development of the 2d bed topography in a river with hybrid bars for the simulations with variable discharge we did not accelerate the computations mf 1 as a result the running times were 10 years for all constant discharge scenarios with mf 10 and 100 years for the variable discharge scenarios with mf 1 this means that we computationally cover 100 years in all cases the computational time proved to be long enough to reach a new morphodynamic equilibrium characterized by negligible temporal changes of the average bed elevation of the parallel channels see chapter 4 table 2 summarizes the numerical parameters used in the simulations 3 3 model runs the investigation comprises 102 different model runs these are meant to study the effects on bifurcation stability of longitudinal wall starting point runs w 0 width ratio runs w 0 w 1 and w 2 and variable discharge runs v 0 v 1 and v 2 with different width ratios the investigation includes a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects on bifurcation stability of the deviation of bed load direction due to transverse bed slope runs a in addition four runs are carried out to study bifurcation stability in a sinuous channel runs s these are especially meant to investigate whether accounting for the effects of spiral flow on bed load direction may result in different morphological trends since spiral flow deviates bed load transport in opposite direction compared to transverse bed slope struiksma et al 1985 kleinhans et al 2008 ottevanger 2013 the performed simulations are listed in table 3 all scenarios included a reference case without longitudinal wall but with a transverse wall to generate the initial bed topography with alternate hybrid bars this bed topography is then the starting condition of all the other runs to study the influence of bars on the stability of the bifurcation created by the start of the longitudinal wall several starting locations were identified with respect to a selected steady bar fig 7 these locations are numbered from 1 to 18 location 18 corresponds to location 1 with respect to the next bar the effects of the starting location were then analysed for different width ratios namely b1 b2 1 5 w 0 base case scenario 1 2 w 1 and 1 1 w 2 see table 3 4 results 4 1 effects of starting location the 18 simulations reproducing the long term morphological developments of the base case scenario w0 runs with b1 b2 1 5 and constant discharge differ solely in the starting location of the longitudinal wall the results show that if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a steady bar i e at locations 3 7 the side channel silts up fig 8 b instead if the training wall starts in the downstream part of the bar i e at locations 11 17 the side channel deepens and it is the main channel that silts up in this case the side channel eventually conveys almost all the water discharge fig 8d a different morphodynamic behavior is observed if the training wall starts near the bar top at locations 8 10 in this case the results show a dynamic balance in which the side channel experiences cycles of erosion and sedimentation and remains open fig 8c every cycle comprises three steps fig 9 1 rise of side channel bed 2 bar formation near the upstream end of the side channel and side channel bed erosion 3 upstream bar erosion and return to the initial state these cycles repeat continuously during the 100 years covered by the computations the first cycle is illustrated in fig 9 the simulated systems were slightly super resonant at average flow in this case the perturbation caused by the starting of the longitudinal wall might affect the shape of the steady bars upstream redolfi et al 2016 however the obtained results do not always show upstream influence of the bifurcation point indeed when the training wall starts in the upstream part fig 8b or near the bar top fig 8c upstream bars do not show any changes compared to the reference case fig 8a when the training wall starts in the downstream part a bar deformation extends to a distance upstream of about 3 bar wavelengths fig 8d independently from the bifurcation point no bars formed upstream of the transverse forcing dam that was placed to generate the series of hybrid bars downstream not in the figures fig 10 a shows the temporal variations of the proportion of total discharge that flows in the side channel q1 q0 in some representative cases if q1 q0 0 all the discharge is conveyed by the main channel if q1 q0 1 all the discharge is conveyed by the side channel the fastest developments pertain to the cases in which the side channel becomes increasingly deep fig 10b shows the variations of sediment transport ratio versus discharge ratio during the computations the initial discharge ratio q 1 q 2 being about 1 8 this figure shows also theoretical sediment transport ratios as a function of q 1 q 2 for b1 b2 1 5 base case scenario computed using eq 1 wang et al 1995 in the logarithmic scale graph the values of the exponent k are represented by the slope of the straight lines according to wang et al the bifurcation is stable both channels remain open for k 5 3 and unstable one of the channels silts up for k 5 3 in case sediment transport capacity is governed by the formula of engelund and hansen 1967 this is the transport formula adopted in the simulations the application of wang et al s theory implies deriving the constant value of k by calibration for the performed numerical tests this would lead to the selection of a value of k within the instability conditions for most cases for location 10 however the numerical results show that the system assumes a dynamic balance in which it alternates between a stable bifurcation with a slope k in fig 10b that is steeper than 5 3 and an unstable bifurcation with a slope that is less than 5 3 temporal variations thus allow a limit cycle that is not a possible solution in the theoretical analysis of wang et al 1995 that uses a constant value of k this suggests that an oscillating distribution of discharges can arise as inherent system behavior not necessarily imposed by the alternating arrival of migrating bars from upstream as in hirose et al 2003 and bertoldi and tubino 2007 because in our system we do not have migrating bars at the longitudinal wall starting location this behaviour can be theoretically described only when allowing for temporal variations of k in wang et al 1995 formula eq 1 4 2 effects of altering the width ratio between side and main channel the results of the long term morphological simulations show that altering the width ratio does not change the final result the trends are the same as in the base case scenario fig 11 if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a hybrid bar the side channel silts up fig 11a instead if the training wall starts in the downstream part of the same bar the side channel deepens and the main channel aggrades fig 11c if the training wall starts near the bar top both channels remain open fig 11b fig 12 shows the temporal variations of the proportion of total discharge that flows in the side channel q1 q0 for various width ratios if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a bar the side channel silts up completely q1 q0 0 dash dot lines as seen in the previous section this happens for all considered width ratios except for b1 b2 1 1 side and main channel having equal width where the process is slower red line and does not result in complete closure of one of the channels if the training wall starts in the downstream part of a bar the side channel eventually conveys most water discharge dash lines it conveys 100 of the water main channel closure only for b1 b2 1 5 black line whereas the main channel remains open for the larger width ratios b1 b2 1 2 and b1 b2 1 1 however also in these cases the side channel still conveys the major part of the discharge with q1 q0 0 95 in the new equilibrium bars are not observable in the deeper channel whereas some low amplitude bars are present in the silting up channel they are the remains of bars that formed during the transition period when the training wall starts near the bar top both channels remain open continuous lines the larger the width ratio the more water flows through the side channel these results suggest that enlarging the width ratio increases the stability of the bifurcation in general the evolution with constant discharge is relatively fast when it does not reach a dynamic balance it reaches the dominant configuration in which one of the parallel channels silts up within the first 14 years 4 3 effects of variable discharge a set of runs was carried out to study the effects of variable discharge on bifurcation stability considering that flow variations can influence the bar location and geometry as well as the sediment distribution between the two channels as in the previous set of runs three different width ratios were considered b1 b2 1 5 base case scenario b1 b2 1 2 and b1 b2 1 1 the following three starting locations were analysed 4 upstream of bar top 10 bar top and 17 downstream of bar top see fig 7 the reference case with variable flow started with a flat bed the bars that formed after 100 years can be recognized from fig 13 showing their evolution during the tenth year due to discharge variations bars tend to disappear at peak discharge q 590 m3 s when the width to depth ratio is the minimum b h 15 at peak discharge low amplitude migrating bars are observable in the straight reach with the exception of a forced bar near the transverse wall and a strongly damped hybrid bar further downstream at the opposite side bars start to reform after the peak discharge since small amplitude bars are already visible at the end of the flood wave at a discharge of q 267 m3 s when the width to depth ratio has increased to b h 25 it can be observed that the small migrating bars are gradually suppressed by a series of longer hybrid bars forming downstream of the transverse wall after the period characterized by the average discharge q 200 m3 s the small migrating bars are still present and with larger amplitude they are further suppressed in the low discharge period q 151 m3 s the results show that the bar wave length increases whereas the bar amplitude decreases with the discharge this is valid for both hybrid and free migrating bars table 4 presents bar development under variable discharge the analysis of bar evolution shows that influenced by the forcing offered by the transverse wall the first bar on the right side is the most stable one and the second bar on the right side has some variations in shape due to variable discharge in order to observe clear effects of the variable discharge the starting locations of the training wall refer to the second bar on the right side starting the longitudinal wall near one of the most downstream and variable bars could lead to different conclusions the results of the simulations with the longitudinal wall starting from the bed topography at the end of the tenth year of the reference case show bed evolution trends that are similar to the cases with constant discharge fig 14 if the training wall starts in the upstream part of a steady bar the side channel silts up fig 14 a whereas if the training wall starts in the downstream part of the same bar the side channel deepens fig 14 c however if the training wall starts near the bar top the evolution is similar to the case in which the wall starts in the upstream part of the bar fig 14 shows the water depth at the end of the 100th year at low flow for different width ratios it might give the impression that one of the parallel channels always silts up completely but that is not true since the plots refer to the final bed configuration at low flow condition fig 15 shows the temporal evolution of the ratio of side channel discharge to total discharge q1 q0 during the first 30 years both channels remain open from the 31st year on both channels remain open during high flow whereas one of the channels closes during low flow the parallel channel system does not find a dynamic equilibrium as occurs with a constant discharge if the training wall starts at location 10 which is located at 2 2 km from the transverse wall fig 13 dash line the conveyance of the silting channel slowly diminishes with time to reach a constant value after 70 years this could be explained by the longitudinal variation of the reference bar shape due to variable discharge fig 13 the location of the initial bar top is situated in the upstream part of a bar during average to moderate discharge and in a pool at the highest discharge but for a relatively short duration 4 4 sensitivity analysis on the effects of transverse bed slope a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the dependence of bifurcation stability on transverse bed slope by increasing and decreasing its effects on sediment transport direction this was obtained in the model by applying koch and flokstra s 1981 formulation extended for the effect of bedforms according to which the function f θ is calculated as 3 f θ a s h θ b s h d h c s h where ash bsh and csh are calibration coefficients θ represents the shields parameter d is sediment size and h is the normal depth among the three parameters ash is the most sensitive one increasing the value of ash decreases the effects of transverse slope on sediment transport direction schuurman et al 2013 the value of ash normally falls in the range 0 5 1 5 and this is the range of values used for the sensitivity analysis whereas the values of the other calibration coefficients are kept constant bsh 0 5 and csh 0 3 talmon et al 1995 the numerical simulations show that starting from a flat bed different values of ash resulted in different bar characteristics analysing the values in table 5 we can observe that the bar wavelength increases if the bed slope effects increase decreasing ash whereas the opposite trend can be observed for the bar amplitude stronger bed slope effects result in smaller amplitudes based on the equilibrium state two locations for the starting point of the longitudinal training wall were selected location 4 in the upstream part of a bar and location 17 in the downstream part the results show that varying the effect of bed slope did not change the final configuration of the bifurcating channels a training wall starting at location 4 always resulted in side channel silt up whereas a training wall starting at location 17 always resulted in side channel erosion however stronger bed slope effects resulted in slower morphological evolution table 5 which is probably due to the smaller bar amplitude resulting in more equal sediment distribution between the channels 4 5 sinuous planform in this section the numerical simulations represent a sinuous channel with constant discharge of 200 m3 s in the reference case without longitudinal wall point bars naturally formed near the inner bank of bends fig 16 a the longitudinal training wall was set only after the point bars were fully formed three locations for its starting point were selected location 4 in the upstream part of a point bar location 10 near the bar top and location 17 in its downstream part the obtained final configurations are shown in fig 16 the results are similar to the ones obtained with a straight channel fig 8 indicating that the curvature of the channel and the presence of a relatively strong spiral flow ottevanger 2013 do not change the unstable character of the bifurcation created by a longitudinal training wall the results indicate that the effects of the spiral flow are less important for the sediment transport direction and the sediment distribution between side and main channel than the main flow deviation and the bed slope caused by the presence of the point bar at least in the cases examined 5 discussion in the previous sections attention was paid to rather schematized and idealized examples for more realistic applications a few aspects should be considered cell drying was obtained numerically in a rather straightforward way depending on an assigned critical local water depth we believe that the areas that become completely dry under constant discharge in the numerical simulations would still convey some water in reality the experimental study carried out by le et al 2018 supports this because aggrading channels were never found to silt up completely all tests were carried out with sediment transported as bed load the results might be different in presence of substantial amounts of suspended load this remains open for further research keeping a constant value of the bed roughness represented in the models by the chézy coefficient may have altered the dynamics of the system the bed roughness should be a function of water depth becoming gradually higher in the aggrading channel and lower in the deepening one similarly the bed roughness should vary with the discharge the numerical grid used in the computations contains six cells in the cross section because two dimensional aspects of water flow and sediment transport are important for bifurcation studies we also performed other computational tests not shown here with 18 cells the results of the finer grid confirmed the morphological developments obtained with the coarser grid for this reason we decided to use the coarser grid which allowed for the computation of many different scenarios in total 102 model runs an important issue in morphodynamic modelling is the use of a morphological factor mf which accelerates the bed development and decreases the computational time in this study we applied mf 10 but only for the cases with constant discharge after having checked that it does not affect the results in a relevant way to check this we performed a computation using mf 1 no morphological acceleration and obtained after 10 years results that did not differ when plotted in an observable way from the results of one year using mf 10 for variable discharge we represented the yearly hydrograph in a schematic way and performed the computation without any morphological acceleration in this way we could distinguish the yearly effects of the variable discharge in computations with a constant discharge the time corresponding to the morphological developments is merely theoretical using a morphological acceleration factor larger than 1 after having checked that it does not affect the results therefore does not affect the interpretation of the results since the link with time is not clear anyway with variable discharge especially if a yearly hydrograph is used applying a morphological acceleration factor larger than 1 creates an unclear distortion of time and hampers the interpretations of time developments for this reason we discourage the use of morphological acceleration in computations with variable discharge redolfi et al 2016 investigated the stability of a symmetrical bifurcation under steady flow conditions disregarding the presence of alternate bars in the main channel this symmetrical configuration becomes unstable if the original not yet bifurcated channel is at super resonant conditions because due to morphodynamics influence a steady alternate bar forms just upstream of the bifurcation point this bar tends to unbalance the flow and sediment partition between the bifurcating channels in the unsteady flow computations performed here the width to depth ratio falls below the critical value for bar formation during peak flows and for this reason bars tend to disappear fig 13 at the end of the flood wave hybrid bars are incipient and short migrating bars are present hybrid bars are fully developed after the low flow period although some bar irregularities are present due to the interactions with remains of free bars the conditions at average discharge occurring after the flood wave are close to resonance and at the lowest discharge the systems is super resonant according to zolezzi and seminara 2001 upstream morphodynamic influence may occur only at the lowest flow rates however we do not observe any steady bar interfering with hybrid bars near the bifurcation at the end of the low flow period this is a sign of possible hybrid bar dominance as a consequence we can conclude that upstream morphodynamic influence does not affect bifurcation stability at the conditions considered in this study hypothetically if super resonant conditions were present for a longer period i e also at higher discharges a steady bar might develop near the bifurcation in this case the stability of the channel system would be determined by the competition between the steady bar at the node and the hybrid bars in the channel further investigations are needed to show at which conditions one of the two would prevail 6 conclusions and recommendations this work addresses the stability of the system of two parallel channels separated by a longitudinal training wall the effects of hybrid steady alternate bars near the bifurcation point on their morphological evolution have been investigated by means of a 2d numerical model developed using the delft3d code the results of the numerical simulations show that the two channel system with a training wall along one side of the river tends to become unstable with the silting up of either the narrower side channel or the wider main channel these results are valid for both straight and sinuous channels with either constant or variable discharge the results of the numerical simulations show three final scenarios depending on the starting location of the longitudinal walls in the first scenario the training wall starts in the upstream part of a bar in this case all water flow eventually concentrates in the main channel and as a result the side channel gradually silts up in the second scenario the training wall starts in the downstream part of a bar in this case all water is eventually conveyed by the side channel and as a result the main channel gradually silts up if the training wall starts in a limited area near the bar top both channels reach a dynamic balance and remain open however this third scenario only occurs for constant discharge since discharge variability results in the silting up of one channel in this case too this is caused by the elongation and shortening of the bars that result from the discharge variations changing the widths of the parallel channels did not change the trends observed in the base case scenario the most stable system is obtained if the longitudinal wall subdivides the river in two equally wide parallel channels in this case the morphological process appears much slower than in the other cases and the channel characterized by bed level rise does not appear to silt up completely this study shows that in rivers with hybrid bars the position of the upstream end of the training wall plays an important role in the morphological development of the system our results indicate that the upstream end of a training wall is best located near the top of a bar this can be readily understood from the physical processes at the bifurcation bifurcation instability arises when the supply of sediment to a branch deviates from the transport capacity immediately downstream two factors play a role first this deviation between supply and transport capacity is smallest in river sections without streamwise gradients in flow field and bed topography where lateral exchanges are at a minimum such sections are found at bar tops and in bar troughs second deviations between sediment supply and transport capacity produce faster morphological changes in deeper areas where sediment transport is higher small deviations thus produce faster loss of stability in bar troughs than at bar tops that makes bar tops the most suitable locations for the bifurcation yet this does not guarantee stability in natural rivers where hybrid and point bars continuously change in length and position due to discharge variations claude et al 2014 which means that the location of the training wall relative to a bar continuously changes with time the upstream entrance of the side channel might therefore require an appropriate bank line configuration or a control structure to enforce a favorable location since the first hybrid bars near a forcing are the most stable ones discharge variations and the arrival of free migrating bars may produce cyclic growth and decay of bifurcated channels hirose et al 2003 bertoldi and tubino 2007 our findings suggest however that such cycles may also arise spontaneously as inherent system behavior if the development of bifurcated channels alters the relationship between sediment transport ratio and discharge ratio e g expressed as a change in k eq 1 the simulated systems were super resonant but close to resonant conditions blondeaux and seminara 1985 in this case steady bars may form also upstream of the bifurcation due to the flow perturbation caused by the start of the longitudinal wall redolfi et al 2016 the obtained results however do not always show upstream influence of the bifurcation point apart from a local bed deformation extending to a distance upstream on the order of magnitude of 3 bar wave lengths fig 8 no bars formed upstream of the transverse forcing wall that was placed to generate a series of hybrid bars downstream in general the evolution with constant discharge is faster than the evolution with variable discharge this is because with constant discharge location and size of the bar close to the bifurcation did not change and transported sediment was permanently deviated in the same way with variable discharge the bar tended to disappear during peak flows and the deviation of sediment towards the silting up channel was not always present in our numerical simulations when it does not reach a dynamic balance the final bed configuration is obtained within the first 14 years with variable discharges the final configuration is obtained after 70 years fig 15 this result suggests that in real rivers with natural discharges the morphological development after the construction of a longitudinal training wall may last for a long time the bifurcation formed by a longitudinal training wall is inherently unstable but we found the condition at which the morphological changes develop rather slowly which makes the bifurcation manageable as a result we recommend designing longitudinal training walls in such a way that the upstream starting point is located at the top of a bar the bar top location can be fixated by constructing a groyne or structure upstream if this is not possible the optimal location of the starting point could be obtained by carefully studying the variation in bar length due to discharge variability channel maintenance is minimized if the two channels have more or less the same width acknowledgment this work is sponsored by vietnam international education development vied

861,in the present study we investigate the energy flux at the sediment water interface and the relevance of the heat exchanged between water and sediment for the water temperature dynamics in shallow coastal environments water and sediment temperature data collected in the venice lagoon show that in shallow temperate lagoons temperature is uniform within the water column and enabled us to estimate the net heat flux at the sediment water interface we modeled this flux as the sum of a conductive component and of the solar radiation reaching the bottom finding the latter being negligible we developed a point model to describe the temperature dynamics of the sediment water continuum driven by vertical energy transfer we applied the model considering conditions characterized by negligible advection obtaining satisfactory results we found that the heat exchange between water and sediment is crucial for describing sediment temperature but plays a minor role on the water temperature keywords sediment temperature dynamics water temperature dynamics field measurements shallow tidal environments energy fluxes 1 introduction despite wide interest in understanding biological and geomorphological dynamics in lagoon and estuarine environments likens 2010 energy exchanges at the sediment water interface in shallow water bodies are rarely studied and remain poorly understood

2010 paterson 1989 temperature in the underlying sediment layers is a major determinant of biochemical kinetics and of the recycling of nutrient and toxic materials within the sediment column fang and stefan 1998 the approaches for modeling temperature dynamics and energy fluxes in aquatic systems found in the literature can be categorized under three main types regression models semi empirical

bayesian multiple regression semi empirical models kettle et al 2004 piccolroaz et al 2013 are based on parameterized formulations drawn from physical principles the parameters introduced usually lose their direct physical meaning and must be defined through calibration regression and semi empirical models provide simplified representations of the physical processes at play with the advantage of involving less input information and computational burden they are typically used for long term analyses and applications focus on deep waters away from the coastal zone process based energy balance models fang and stefan 1996 martynov et al 2010 like the one developed in this paper are based on a physically based description of radiative conductive and advective energy transfer within the water sediment continuum calibrating and running these models requires accurate time series of input meteorological data process based models however allow the detailed investigation of the relative role of the physical processes involved and the development of an understanding of their relative importance under different forcing conditions this latter advantage is exploited here to identify the magnitude and controls of sediment water interface energy exchanges to our knowledge few studies have investigated the water temperature dynamics and energy balance in shallow coastal environments e g bouin et al 2012 umgiesser et al 2004 even fewer studies focus on the description of energy exchanges at the sediment water interface heat exchange at the sediment water interface was studied in coastal regions to describe temperature evolution in bed sediments guarini et al 1997 smith 2002 but without fully solving for the two way coupling of sediment water energy fluxes the mutual interaction between water and sediment temperature was studied in lakes and in absence of tidal fluctuations to determine the dynamics of temperature in the underlying bed sediment boike et al 2015 fang and stefan 1996 and of the hypolimnion warming induced by seiche oscillations kirillin et al 2009 nishri et al 2015 the aim of the present study is to investigate the evolution of the temperature profile in the water sediment continuum in a very shallow tidal environment in particular we aim to analyze observationally and numerically the temporal variation of the vertical temperature profile within the sediment water continuum with particular attention to the energy flux exchanged at the sediment water interface herein after swi our analysis focuses on a study site located in the venice lagoon italy where temperature was measured at several points within the water and the sediment column with time resolution of 5 minutes for about one year observations were used to compute the heat flux at the swi and interpreted using a point model describing the time evolution of the vertical distribution of temperature the heat exchanged at the swi was then compared with the computed energy fluxes at the air water interface herein after awi in order to understand its relevance compared to the other vertical energy fluxes 2 field observations 2 1 study site the venice lagoon is a shallow tidal basin located in northeastern italy with an area of about 550 km2 a mean depth of about 1 2 m a typical tidal range of 1 0 m and a main tidal period of 12 h it is connected to the adriatic sea by three inlets lido malamocco and chioggia we performed temperature observations in a shallow tidal flat in the northern part of the lagoon see fig 1 where bathymetric and morphological information were already available bendoni et al 2016 between july 2015 and may 2016 the bottom elevation at the measuring station is 0 65 m below mean sea level and the local tidal range is about 0 80 m during a spring tide and 0 50 m during a neap tide therefore the tidal flat is almost permanently submerged except for rare meteorological conditions in fact the tidal flat emerged only once during the one year monitoring period and only for few hours the study site was chosen quite close to the divide between two sub basins of the lagoon d alpaos 2010 solidoro et al 2004 i e the boundary separating areas to from which sea water is transported along different paths through the treporti channel and the san nicoló channel the divide between sub basins are area theoretically lines where the tidally induced water velocity and the associated horizontal heat transport is theoretically equal to zero the position of our study site is therefore the best for limiting the relevance of the advective energy transport to the water column energy balance thus favouring the estimation and analysis of the vertical fluxes driving the local temperature dynamics and allowing the application of a point model 2 2 sensors we deployed temperature sensors in the sediment at depths of 5 10 25 50 100 150 cm below the sediment surface and in the water column at 10 40 70 100 cm above the sediment surface the digital temperature sensors have an accuracy 0 5 c with a logging resolution of 0 0625 c controlbyweb xytronix inc utah usa and were connected to an arduino pro328 microcomputer with a data logging shield adafruit new york usa the temperature sensors in the water column were variably submerged by water depending on the local tidal elevation measured by a pressure transducer u20 hobo onset massachusetts usa all data were collected at five minutes intervals the data logger and sensors were powered by sealed lead acid batteries the duration of a battery charge is temperature dependent and was the cause of some missing data over a period of 318 days from july 17 to may 31 we collected data for 134 days with continuous data records that are all longer than one week see fig 2 the pressure transducer was in operation only during the first month of the campaign water level data from this period were related to the tidal observations recorded at burano by a tide gauge of the venice municipality monitoring network tidal levels from the burano station were then used for the remainder of the data collection window 2 3 measurements and data the almost 1 year long temperature dataset contains gaps due to the variable duration of the batteries but continuous data records are all longer than one week the longest stretches being longer than one month see fig 2 we were thus able to investigate temperature changes over time scales from minutes to seasons the meteorological data necessary to compute the heat fluxes at the air water interface awi are solar

monitoring stations considered for each input parameter the location of the different stations is shown in fig 1 air temperature and relative humidity are measured at 14 m above the mean sea level at the measuring station of palazzo cavalli while the wind speed is measured at 9 m above the mean sea level at the measuring station of laguna nord where the wind regime can be considered characteristic of the entire northern part of the lagoon carniello et al 2012 carniello et al 2014 the solar radiation transducer measures all the solar radiation spectrum with a measuring range of 0 3 3 μ m more information about the monitoring stations can be found at the venice municipality website cittá di venezia 2017 we used tidal level observations from the burano station the tide gauge closest to our study site to complement local water depth observations the comparison of the tidal levels measured at the two locations during the first month of the field campaign while the pressure transducer was deployed showed consistent values with a lag of 5 min i e the tidal signal reaches the sant erasmo station 5 min before it reaches the burano station more precisely the root mean square error between the tidal signal computed using the pressure data and the signal measured at burano anticipated of 5 min is 0 01 m while the value of the pearson s linear correlation coefficient is 1 indicating an almost perfect agreement see also figure s 1 of the supplementary material this information was used to ensure that tidal level values at the study site could be reconstructed during the entire campaign hourly information on cloud cover obtained from model simulations mesinger et al 2012 were provided by the forecasting service ilmeteo 2017 as a weighted average of cloud cover values at different heights 3 methods 3 1 sediment temperature and energy flux at the swi the vertical temperature profile within the sediment is described by solving the 1 d heat diffusion equation applied to the sediment implicitly neglecting the effect of the horizontal fluxes more precisely horizontal diffusion is neglected because of the small horizontal temperature gradient fang and stefan 1998 while horizontal energy advection is neglected because of the small values of the sediment hydraulic conductivity typical of these environments tosatto et al 2009 ursino et al 2004 the 1 d heat diffusion equation describing the sediment temperature dynamics is the following 1 t s t z t 1 c s z k t s t z z α 2 t s t z z 2 where ts t z c is sediment temperature at time t s and depth z m below the swi c s j m 3 c 1 is the sediment thermal capacity per unit volume k w m 1 c 1 is the sediment thermal conductivity α k c s m 2 s 1 is the sediment thermal diffusivity we consider uniform and temporally constant sediment thermal properties i e cs α and k constant in t and z eq 1 is solved using a finite elements method imposing either the value of the temperature along the boundary dirichlet boundary condition bc or the value of the heat flux neumann bc imposition of the energy flux as bc at the swi allows us to account for the potential contribution of the residual solar radiation reaching the sediment bottom we solved eq 1 using a timestep of 5 minutes and a spatial discretization of 2 5 cm assuming homogeneous sediments we used eq 1 to characterize the sediment thermal diffusivity α piccolo et al 1993 we solved eq 1 by imposing the measured sediment temperature profile as ic and the sediment temperature measured at the uppermost and lowermost deployed sensors i e z 0 05 m and z 1 50 m depth as bc we explored a large number of values of α and determined the value that minimized the difference between measured and modeled sediment temperature at intermediate depths i e z 0 25 0 50 1 00 m the heat flux at the swi h s w i w m 2 assumed positive downward i e when entering the soil can be calculated using the sediment temperature data and eq 1 integrated from a prescribed lower boundary condition zlower to the swi z 0 m and solved considering the energy flux as the unknown harrison and phizacklea 1985 2 h s w i c s z l o w e r 0 t s t z t d z k t s t z z z l o w e r the first term on the right hand side of eq 2 represents the energy stored by the sediment between zlower and the swi in dt while the second term represents the energy flux at the lower boundary both these terms can be computed using the available temperature data knowing the flux at the swi we describe hswi as the sum of two components 3 h s w i t h s e d t h r e s t where h s e d w m 2 is the conductive heat flux at the swi due to the temperature gradient between water and sediment while h r e s w m 2 is the residual solar radiation reaching the bottom exploiting the position of the temperature sensors deployed at our measuring station we estimated the temperature gradient at the swi considering the water temperature assumed uniform in the entire water column see 4 1 for further discussion and the temperature measured by the uppermost sensor within the soil i e at z z u p p e r 0 05 m following this approach we model hsed as 4 h s e d t k 1 t w t t s t z u p p e r z u p p e r when t w t t s t z u p p e r 0 k 2 t w t t s t z u p p e r z u p p e r when t w t t s t z u p p e r 0 where k 1 w m 1 c 1 and k 2 w m 1 c 1 are two model parameters describing the conductive heat flux due to the temperature gradient at the swi we distinguish the case of flux directed downward i e when water temperature is higher than sediment temperature and upward i e when sediment temperature is higher than water temperature in order to consider the effects of possibly unstable conditions favoring the formation of convective cells the residual solar radiation hres at the bottom is computed as 5 h r e s t r 0 t e λ y t where r 0 t 1 a r s u n t w m 2 is the solar irradiance not reflected by the water surface a is the water surface albedo λ m 1 is the extinction coefficient representing the irradiance absorption per unit depth of the water column λ is time dependent being a function of water turbidity turbidity data are not available at our study site therefore we treat λ as a model parameter and find the value of λ that best represents on average water column conditions we performed the calibration of the model parameters using the random sampling technique testing several combination of parameters in order to identify the parameters combination that maximizes the agreement between hswi computed from the sediment temperature data using eq 2 and hswi modeled using eq 3 3 2 water temperature dynamics as we are dealing with a very shallow water environment we can assume the temperature to be uniform within the water column as shown also by our field observation see fig 4 we thus assume a single temperature value to represent the thermal state of the well mixed water column whose dynamics is described by the following equation 6 d t w t d t 1 c w t h n t where tw t c is the water column temperature c w t j c 1 m 2 is the thermal capacity of the water column h n t w m 2 is the net energy flux driving the water column dynamics the thermal capacity is given by c w t ρ w c p w y t where ρ w kg m 3 is water density c p w j kg 1 c 1 the water specific heat both assumed constants and y t m is the water depth the net incoming energy flux h n w m 2 is given by the sum of the horizontal and vertical energy fluxes affecting the water column we consider sediment in suspension to be in thermal equilibrium with water furthermore we assume the values of suspended sediment concentration characterizing shallow tidal environments and the venice lagoon in particular not high enough ssc never exceeds the order of magnitude of 10 2 mg l 1 in the venice lagoon see e g venier et al 2014 to affect the water thermal properties focusing on the vertical energy fluxes the contributions to hn consist on the following terms see sketch in fig 3 i short wave radiation solar irradiance not reflected by the water surface h s h o w m 2 partially absorbed by water according to beer s law integrated over the water column ii net incoming long wave radiation h l o n w m 2 which is the difference between radiation emitted by the atmosphere and fully absorbed by water and the long wave radiation emitted by the water column iii sensible heat flux h s e n w m 2 which is the convective heat flux exchanged at the awi iv latent heat flux h l a t w m 2 exchanged between water and atmosphere v conductive heat flux at the swi h s e d w m 2 exchanged between water and sediment the formulations used to evaluate the energy fluxes at the awi are described in appendix a in particular the long wave net radiation is computed following bignami et al 1995 formulation calibrated and tested using data from the mediterranean sea sensible and latent heat fluxes are computed following a simplified bulk parameterization based on the monin obukhov similarity theory fairall et al 2003 we assume heat transfer between the water column and the sediment suspended during a storm event to be negligible even during intense storm events erosion only affects a small volume of sediments a few mm at the swi carniello et al 2012 where it can be assumed to be in approximate thermal equilibrium with the overlying water a horizontal energy flux is generated by the advection of water by tidal and secondarily wind currents to estimate this flux a 2 d approach describing the full hydrodynamic circulation is needed however the aim of this study is to evaluate the relevance of hswi for the water temperature dynamics for which a simple 1 d approach focusing on the vertical energy balance of the water column is most appropriate experimental conditions were selected in order to ensure that horizontal energy exchanges were small see discussion in paragraph 2 1 to provide an appropriate test furthermore eq 6 can be used to compute on the basis of observed water temperature time series the net energy flux hn entering leaving the water column this flux can be compared with the sum of the vertical energy fluxes computed at the awi using the formulation in appendix a and evaluated at the swi using eq 2 the deviation obtained from this comparison allows the quantification of the potential importance of the advective component see paragraph 4 5 and to identify if and under what conditions such contribution may become important finally once the energy balance model is tested against observations advective energy flux components can be readily added using a model of shallow water flows it is also worth noting that we focus here on energy exchanges at the swi while we do not describe exchanges at the air sediment interface during low tides the study site was also chosen to minimize the occurrence of tidal flat emergence however the formulation presented here can be expanded to describe air sediment energy exchanges by properly adapting our formulation e g see approach in guarini et al 2000 3 3 temperature profile within the water sediment continuum coupling eqs 1 and 6 we develop and apply a point model for describing the energy transfer through the water sediment continuum that considers reflection scattering and absorption of radiative energy and conduction of heat in the vertical direction in order to apply the model we need an initial condition ic specifying the initial water temperature tw 0 and the initial vertical temperature profile within the sediment ts 0 z the value of the sediment thermal diffusivity α assumed to be constant along the vertical direction within the sediment column considered in our analysis the model parameters k 1 k 2 and λ necessary to compute the energy flux at the swi the meteorological data to be imposed as boundary condition bc for evaluating the energy fluxes at the awi in particular the required meteorological inputs are solar radiation at the water surface r s u n

sediments to be imposed as bc at the lower limit of the computational domain in the present analysis the ic and bc for the point model are derived from the observations collected at the measuring station more precisely we use the temperature profile at t 0 s as ic the time record of the sediment temperature at z 1 50 m as bc at the lower limit of the domain thus solving the sediment temperature dynamics only in the upper 1 5 m thick layer of sediments the use of a full set of observed ic and bc clearly undermines the possibility of using the model as a predictive tool as these type of data are typically not available particularly in the sediment column in order to limit the need of observations in the sediment column we propose to use as ic the vertical temperature profile provided by an analytical solution of the heat diffusion eq 1 that describes the daily mean temperature profile evolution over the year following nishri et al 2015 the analytical solution of 1 is 7 t s t z t 0 t a e x p z ω 2 α sin ω t l d z ω 2 α where t 0 c is the average annual temperature at the swi ta c is the amplitude of the annual temperature variation at the swi ω 2 π 365 25 d 1 is the annual angular frequency α m 2 d 1 is the sediment thermal diffusivity ld d is the phase shift we used the available sediment temperature data to calibrate the values of t 0 ta α and ld by maximizing the agreement between the computed and measured vertical mean daily temperature profile the calibrated value of α provides a further estimation of the sediment properties to be compared with that obtained using 1 in addition to providing a reliable ic for the vertical temperature profile within the bed sediment when temperature data are not available the analytical solution 7 allows to extend the ic to the depth below the swi where the sediment temperature is not affected by the seasonal temperature fluctuations for temperate latitudes and silty sand sediments typically z 10 m in this way the bc at the lower limit of the domain can be imposed assuming a constant value for the temperature equal to the mean annual temperature at the swi for the specific location 3 4 error parameters we

during a summer and a winter day in both cases we notice that i water temperature is uniform within the water column observation supported also by water temperature measurements collected in previous studies at other locations within the venice lagoon mav 2004 which supports the assumption of a uniform water layer to represent the thermal dynamics in the water see section 3 2 ii the temperature variation at the daily timescale affects only the topmost 30 50 cm of the sediment iii sediment temperature varies throughout the entire monitored sediment layer over seasonal time scales as illustrated by comparing a summer and a winter day in fig 4 iv in summer the mean temperature of the sediment is lower than the mean water temperature and the heat flux is on average directed from the water to the sediment while in winter the opposite pattern is observed 4 2 sediment thermal properties data collected during the field campaign were used to provide an initial characterization of the thermal properties of the tidal flat sediments thermal diffusivity α m 2 s 1 assumed uniform within the sediment i e we assume homogeneous bed sediment was estimated using eq 1 as described in paragraph 3 1 in particular we explored 104 different values of thermal diffusivity α in the range 10 7 α 10 6 m 2 s 1 we then determined the value of α that simultaneously minimized the rmse between measured and computed sediment temperature data at intermediate depths more precisely we minimized the following objective function 10 f t i r m s e 2 z i where rmse zi is the rmse between the measured and computed sediment temperature at zi z i 0 25 0 50 1 00 m we considered a moving time window of 15 days and determined for each time window the optimal value for α fig 5 a shows the frequency distribution of the values obtained for α from the calibration procedure ranging from 4 7 10 7 and 8 0 10 7 m 2 s 1 with a maximum rmse over all the periods considered of 0 25 c the results suggest that the most appropriate value for characterizing the sediment thermal diffusivity at our measuring station is α 6 0 10 7 m 2 s 1 the estimated value of thermal diffusivity is coherent with a silty sand kim et al 2007 a sediment characterization also confirmed by the analysis of sediment cores collected in situ by solving eq 1 using the identified value of α 6 0 10 7 m 2 s 1 for all the considered periods we obtained a good description of the temperature dynamics within the sediments yielding a maximum rmse of 0 3 c as confirmed by the scatter plots of modeled vs observed sediment temperature at different depths in fig 5 b and c based on the above sediment characterization we derived from kim et al 2007 the following values of thermal capacity per unit volume c s 3 00 10 6 j m 3 c 1 and thermal conductivity k c s α 1 8 w m 1 c 1 4 3 daily mean sediment temperature profile following the approach described in paragraph 3 3 we calibrated the parameters t 0 ta α ld in eq 7 by applying the random sampling technique to minimize the difference between the mean daily temperature derived from the data collected at the measuring station and those computed using eq 7 in particular we tested 106 random combinations of parameters within the following ranges 0 t 0 30 c 0 ta 20 c 0 α 0 1 m 2 d 1 150 l d 150 d we identified the best combination of the parameters as the combination that minimizes the target function 10 with z i 0 05 0 25 0 50 1 00 1 50 m fig 6 shows the results of the calibration highlighting the best values for the parameters fig 6 a and two sample comparisons of mean daily temperature profiles measured and computed following the calibration fig 6 b and c in table 2 we report the calibrated values of the parameters toward the goal of providing a reliable ic for the vertical temperature profile within the bed sediment when temperature data are not available the temperature profile computed using the analytical formula does favorably compare with the observed one as shown in fig 6 b and c the value of α obtained α 5 3 10 2 m 2 d 1 6 1 10 7 m 2 s 1 from the present calibration procedure well matches the value obtained following the procedure described in section 4 2 α 6 0 10 7 m 2 s 1 supporting the reliability of the previous analysis 4 4 heat flux at the swi once the sediment thermal properties were estimated 4 2 we computed the energy flux at the swi hswi from eq 2 properly discretized using the available sediment temperature data the computed flux hswi was then used to calibrate the parameters k 1 k 2 and λ of eq 3 we performed the calibration over 55 sliding window periods of 15 days using the random sampling technique we explored for each period 106 random parameter combinations e g see fig 5 a and b and looked for the values that maximized the efficiency of the model as described by the nash sutcliffe coefficient 9 the results of the calibration procedure revealed that the model better reproduces the process in summer and spring ns usually greater than 0 75 see fig 7 a and b while on average the values of the ns coefficient are lower in winter ns in the range 0 50 0 60 we ascribe this both to the lower amount of data available for the winter season see fig 2 which made the calibration procedure less robust and to the fact that during winter the computed flux at the swi is lower than in summer and spring such that energy advection within the sediment which we neglect in our 1 d approach might become more relevant focusing on the summer and spring periods we performed a frequency analysis of the calibration results fig 7 c clearly shows that our analysis identifies different values of k 1 and k 2 for the two seasons with larger values of both the parameters in spring this observation seems to suggest a seasonal variation of the parameters probably due to the different temperature characterizing the sediment and to the different stability conditions of the water column however the available data covering less than 1 year are not sufficient to confirm and define a clear seasonal trend the values of k 1 and k 2 we selected for modeling the heat flux at the swi are listed in table 3 the ratio k 2 k 1 is quite similar for the two seasons and equal to about 1 5 1 75 therefore with the same temperature gradient between water and sediment the energy flux is larger if directed towards the water we can ascribe this behavior to the different stability condition affecting the water column where the formation of convective cells might contribute to the column mixing thus increasing the capability of the water to absorb the heat provided by bed sediments the frequency analysis further shows that both in summer and spring the best value for parameter λ is larger than 7 m 1 this suggests that water turbidity at our study site is in general i e not only during storm events when suspended sediment concentration is increased by bed sediment entrainment carniello et al 2016 note that periods characterized by wind speed higher than 10 m s 1 represent only the 8 of our dataset high enough to absorb most of the incoming solar radiation such that the residual irradiance reaching the sediment surface hres is negligible i e from eq 3 hswi hsed this also explains why λ seems to be not well identified from the dotty plots in fig 7 a and b in fact when λ exceeds a threshold roughly λ 6 m 1 hres is negligible and no longer affects the results of the calibration our findings are consistent with persistent turbid water column conditions characterizing the venice lagoon carniello et al 2012 2014 venier et al 2014 and very shallow lakes subin et al 2012 fig 7 d provides two examples of the capability of eq 4 using the calibrated value of k 1 and k 2 listed in table 3 of reproducing the dynamics of the heat flux at the swi for both a summer and a spring period in particular in fig 7 d the flux is positive when directed toward the water column in order to estimate the relevance of the thermal interaction between water and sediments at the swi hsed on the energy balance of the water column we compared the hswi computed from eq 2 on the basis of the sediment temperature data being hswi hsed with the fluxes at the awi hsho hlon hsen hlat computed using the meteorological forcings as input for the formulas described in appendix a fig 8 shows a comparison of the contribution of each vertical energy flux to the total energy exchanged at the hourly and daily timescale for a summer fig 8 a and b and a winter fig 8 c and d period respectively the contribution of the flux to the energy balance is positive when it is directed toward the water column i e when the flux contributes at warming the water more precisely we show the hourly daily contribution of each energy flux normalized using the total energy exchanged i e the sum of the different contributions in absolute value for each hour day focusing on the daily timescale analysis fig 8 a and 8 c typically used in limnology we observe that in summer the most important fluxes are the short wave radiation hsho and the latent heat flux hlat in winter hsho still plays an important role but also the long wave energy flux hlon becomes important hswi represents the smallest term in the total energy balance never exceeding the 10 the hourly timescale analysis fig 8 b and d more consistent with our investigation shows that both in summer and winter hsho represents the most important contribution during the day in summer hlon and hlat play a relevant role by cooling the water and become the most important fluxes during nighttime the contribution of hswi is limited usually lower than 10 and never exceeding 20 the hourly timescale analysis also shows that on average the flux at the swi is directed toward the sediment in summer and toward the water column in winter these observations seem to suggest that for the considered study site the heat flux at the swi can be neglected when modeling the water column temperature dynamics we will further investigate this in section 4 6 based on the point model application on the contrary hswi is crucial for describing the sediment temperature dynamics 4 5 net energy flux relevance of the horizontal advection based on the measured water temperature time series we used eq 6 as described in paragraph 3 2 for computing the net flux hn exchanged by the water column at our study site with the surrounding domain following such an approach the computed data based hn necessarily accounts for both the horizontal and vertical heat fluxes we then compared the data based net energy flux hn with the energy flux obtained summing the computed vertical energy fluxes entering exiting the water column hnvert in particular h n v e r t h a w i h s e d where hawi is the sum of the energy fluxes at the awi hsho hlon hsen hlat computed using formulas from the literature see appendix a while hsed is the flux exchanged between water and sediment at the swi computed from the available sediment temperature data using eq 2 as described in the previous paragraph fig 9 a compares the two fluxes hn and hnvert over a 5 days long period while fig 9 b shows the comparison between the water temperature measured in the sea ts and at our measuring station inside the lagoon tl we observe that the dynamics of the two fluxes is similar but there are some marked differences mainly characterizing the flood tidal phase in particular the net energy flux hn is in this case lower than the sum of the vertical energy fluxes hnvert especially during flood phases occurred in the morning of the 3 rd 4 th and 5 th of august characterized by a quite large tidal excursion and a temperature of the sea quite lower than the lagoon temperature this observation suggests that the disagreement can be ascribed to the advective transport of colder water from the sea to the lagoon that is not accounted for in hnvert this is further confirmed by noting that the agreement between hn and hnvert is much better on august 1 st when ts and tl have much similar values fig 9 b the above observations suggest that in order to investigate the water and sediment temperature dynamics using a 1 d vertical approach such as the one described in the section 3 3 it is necessary to limit the analysis to the available period in which the horizontal advection is indeed negligible i e to neap tide periods i e small tidal oscillation and or periods in which the difference between water temperature at the sea and inside the lagoon are small 4 6 model application as discussed in the previous paragraph the point model we introduced in section 3 3 can be applied to reconstruct the sub diurnal water and sediment temperature dynamics when the horizontal advective energy fluxes are negligible although the study site was chosen in order to limit the importance of advection we found that its contribution to the total energy balance is often not negligible thus limiting the applicability of the proposed 1 d approach notwithstanding we identified in our dataset periods characterized by negligible horizontal energy transport i e periods characterized by a small tidal excursion and or similar water temperature at the sea and inside the lagoon periods highlighted in blue in fig 2 that we used to verify the capability of our point model to reproduce the temperature dynamics in the water sediment continuum and to further investigate the role of the energy flux at the swi hsed on the water temperature dynamics using parameter values obtained from the calibration described in paragraph 4 2 we applied the model to estimate the time evolution of the vertical temperature profile in the water sediment continuum driven by meteorological forcings we consider two alternative set ups in the first approach we impose a measured vertical temperature profile as ic and the following bc energy fluxes at the awi computed from observed meteorological data measured water level sediment temperature measured at the deepest sensor 1 5 m with reference to the swi in a second set of model runs we impose as ic the sediment temperature profile given by eq 7 and as lower bc a constant bed sediment temperature of 17 c the mean annual temperature at the swi as discussed in paragraph 4 3 at z 10 m with reference to the swi following this approach we do not need sediment temperature observations to perform our computations fig 10 shows sample results obtained by applying the model to reconstruct the temperature profile for a period of 5 days characterized by negligible advection considering the results obtained following the first approach red line we observe a quite good agreement between model results and observations for both the water temperature the rmse between observed and computed tw is 1 0 c while the value of the nash sutcliffe coefficient is 0 6 and the sediment temperature results at z 0 5 m are not shown as sediment temperature is constant this confirms the ability of the model to accurately describe the energy transfer processes and to correctly reproduce temperature dynamics in the water sediment column at the sub diurnal time scale results obtained imposing the analytical sediment temperature profile given by eq 7 as ic yellow line are quite similar to those obtained with the first approach in the upper part of the sediment and in the water column while the error characterizing the ic clearly affects the results deeper within the sediment interestingly the difference between observed sediment temperature and sediment temperature computed imposing as ic the temperature profile estimated using eq 7 decreases in time suggesting that the system and the model rapidly loses memory of the ic and converges to an accurate description of temperature dynamics we can conclude that the analytical solution of eq 1 provides a reasonably good approximation of the temperature profile within the sediment to be used as ic when sediment temperature data are not available further investigations on the time required by the system for loosing memory of the ic suggest that it never exceeds 5 days see supplementary material for further discussion fig 11 a shows the comparison between hsed computed using the temperature data to solve eq 2 being hsed hswi or provided by the model i e using eq 4 positive values of the energy flux correspond to a flux directed toward the water column the good agreement between the fluxes confirms the capability of the model to correctly reproduce the temperature dynamics at the swi fig 11 b compares the time evolution of the water temperature as measured blue line and computed either considering red line or neglecting yellow line hsed in the energy balance the agreement with measured data is clearly satisfactory but more interestingly the negligible difference between the results computed by considering or by neglecting the heat flux at the swi confirms that hsed is small compared with other fluxes contributing to the water column energy balance in order to generalize this observation the process deserves further investigation considering shallower less turbid locations under the effect of different meteorological forcings in closing it is worth noting that hsed remains crucial for describing the sediment temperature dynamics and the dynamics of the biochemical processes that take place within the first layer of sediment 5 summary and conclusions we collected temperature data within the water sediment continuum in a shallow water area in the venice lagoon italy we further developed a point energy balance model that solves for energy transfer processes in the water sediment continuum the model computes the energy fluxes at the air water and sediment water interface and hence the water sediment temperature dynamics and enables us to draw some interesting inferences from the observations observations show that the temperature in the water column is quite uniform in the vertical direction sediment temperature varies over daily time scales within the topmost 30 50 cm layer while seasonal scale temperature variations propagate throughout the entire 1 50 m layer of sediment investigated here under the investigated conditions the contribution of the residual solar radiation at the sediment water interface is found to be negligible the average water turbidity is such that most of the incoming solar radiation is either reflected at the surface or absorbed within the water column even when water depth is small y 0 3 m conductive heat flux is thus the chief energy transfer mechanism at the sediment water interface and crucial to model sediment temperature dynamics however this energy flux is found to play a minor role in determining water temperature dynamics conductive heat exchange at the water sediment interface is mostly less than 10 at the hourly timescale and mostly less than 5 at the daily timescale independently on the season this observation suggests the possibility to model the water temperature dynamics in shallow water environments only as forced by the heat fluxes at the air water interface using parameter values determined on the basis of our observations we applied the model to describe the dynamics of the temperature profile in the water sediment continuum the model applicability is strongly limited by the relevant role usually played by the advection but it properly represents the observed dynamics of the vertical temperature distribution when horizontal advective energy transport is negligible model applications further confirm that neglecting the heat flux at the swi minimally affects the capability of the model in correctly reproducing the water temperature dynamics the formulation presented and tested here constitutes a building block that can be readily incorporated into a fully spatial hydro morphodynamic model to provide a proper description of the energy transfer processes complete of horizontal advective dispersive transport e g carniello et al 2011 2012 2014 proper testing of such a fully spatial energy balance model will require temperature observations distributed in space and time e g through remote sensing and will contribute to further our predictive understanding of temperature dynamics

861,in the present study we investigate the energy flux at the sediment water interface and the relevance of the heat exchanged between water and sediment for the water temperature dynamics in shallow coastal environments water and sediment temperature data collected in the venice lagoon show that in shallow temperate lagoons temperature is uniform within the water column and enabled us to estimate the net heat flux at the sediment water interface we modeled this flux as the sum of a conductive component and of the solar radiation reaching the bottom finding the latter being negligible we developed a point model to describe the temperature dynamics of the sediment water continuum driven by vertical energy transfer we applied the model considering conditions characterized by negligible advection obtaining satisfactory results we found that the heat exchange between water and sediment is crucial for describing sediment temperature but plays a minor role on the water temperature

their direct physical meaning and must be defined through calibration regression and semi empirical models provide simplified representations of the physical processes at play with the advantage of involving less input information and computational burden they are typically used for long term analyses and applications focus on deep waters away from the coastal zone process based energy balance models fang and stefan 1996 martynov et al 2010 like the one developed in this paper are based on a physically based description of radiative conductive and advective energy transfer within the water sediment continuum calibrating and running these models requires accurate time series of input meteorological data process based models however allow the detailed investigation of the relative role of the physical processes involved and the development of an understanding of their relative importance under different forcing conditions this latter advantage is exploited here to identify the magnitude and controls of sediment water interface energy exchanges to our knowledge few studies have investigated the water temperature dynamics and energy balance in shallow coastal environments e g bouin et al 2012 umgiesser et al 2004 even fewer studies focus on the description of energy exchanges at the sediment water interface heat exchange at the sediment water interface was studied in coastal regions to describe temperature evolution in bed sediments guarini et al 1997 smith 2002 but without fully solving for the two way coupling of sediment water energy fluxes the mutual interaction between water and sediment temperature was studied in lakes and in absence of tidal fluctuations to determine the dynamics of temperature in the underlying bed sediment boike et al 2015 fang and stefan 1996 and of the hypolimnion warming induced by seiche oscillations kirillin et al 2009 nishri et al 2015 the aim of the present study is to investigate the evolution of the temperature profile in the water sediment continuum in a very shallow tidal environment in particular we aim to analyze observationally and numerically the temporal variation of the vertical temperature profile within the sediment water continuum with particular attention to the energy flux exchanged at the sediment water interface herein after swi our analysis focuses on a study site located in the venice lagoon italy where temperature was measured at several points within the water and the sediment column with time resolution of 5 minutes for about one year observations were used to compute the heat flux at the swi and interpreted using a point model describing the time evolution of the vertical distribution of temperature the heat exchanged at the swi was then compared with the computed energy fluxes at the air water interface herein after awi in order to understand its relevance compared to the other vertical energy fluxes 2 field observations 2 1 study site the venice lagoon is a shallow tidal basin located in northeastern italy with an area of about 550 km2 a mean depth of about 1 2 m a typical tidal range of 1 0 m and a main tidal period of 12 h it is connected to the adriatic sea by three inlets lido malamocco and chioggia we performed temperature observations in a shallow tidal flat in the northern part of the lagoon see fig 1 where bathymetric and morphological information were already available bendoni et al 2016 between july 2015 and may 2016 the bottom elevation at the measuring station is 0 65 m below mean sea level and the local tidal range is about 0 80 m during a spring tide and 0 50 m during a neap tide therefore the tidal flat is almost permanently submerged except for rare meteorological conditions in fact the tidal flat emerged only once during the one year monitoring period and only for few hours the study site was chosen quite close to the divide between two sub basins of the lagoon d alpaos 2010 solidoro et al 2004 i e the boundary separating areas to from which sea water is transported along different paths through the treporti channel and the san nicoló channel the divide between sub basins are area theoretically lines where the tidally induced water velocity and the associated horizontal heat transport is theoretically equal to zero the position of our study site is therefore the best for limiting the relevance of the advective energy transport to the water column energy balance thus favouring the estimation and analysis of the vertical fluxes driving the local temperature dynamics and allowing the application of a point model 2 2 sensors we deployed temperature sensors in the sediment at depths of 5 10 25 50 100 150 cm below the sediment surface and in the water column at 10 40 70 100 cm above the sediment surface the digital temperature sensors have an accuracy 0 5 c with a logging resolution of 0 0625 c controlbyweb xytronix inc utah usa and were connected to an arduino pro328 microcomputer with a data logging shield adafruit new york usa the temperature sensors in the water column were variably submerged by water depending on the local tidal elevation measured by a pressure transducer u20 hobo onset massachusetts usa all data were collected at five minutes intervals the data logger and sensors were powered by sealed lead acid batteries the duration of a battery charge is temperature dependent and was the cause of some missing data over a period of 318 days from july 17 to may 31 we collected data for 134 days with continuous data records that are all longer than one week see fig

the venice municipality monitoring network tidal levels from the burano station were then used for the remainder of the data collection window 2 3 measurements and data the almost 1 year long temperature dataset contains gaps due to the variable duration of the batteries but continuous data records are all longer than one week the longest stretches being longer than one month see fig 2 we

study site to complement local water depth observations the comparison of the tidal levels measured at the two locations during the first month of the field campaign while the pressure transducer was deployed showed consistent values with a lag of 5 min i e the tidal signal reaches the sant erasmo station 5 min before it reaches the burano station more precisely the root mean square error between the tidal signal computed using the pressure data and the signal measured at burano anticipated of 5 min is 0 01 m while the value of the pearson s linear correlation coefficient is 1 indicating an almost perfect agreement see also figure s 1 of the supplementary material this information was used to ensure that tidal level values at the study site could be reconstructed during the entire campaign hourly information on cloud cover obtained from model simulations mesinger et al 2012 were provided by the forecasting service ilmeteo 2017 as a weighted average of cloud cover values at different heights 3 methods 3 1 sediment temperature and energy flux at the swi the vertical temperature profile within the sediment is described by solving the 1 d heat diffusion equation applied to the sediment implicitly neglecting the effect of the horizontal fluxes more precisely horizontal diffusion is neglected because of the small horizontal temperature gradient fang and stefan 1998 while horizontal energy advection is neglected because of the small values of the sediment hydraulic conductivity typical of these environments tosatto et al 2009 ursino et al 2004 the 1 d heat diffusion equation describing the sediment temperature dynamics is the following 1 t s t z t 1 c s z k t s t z z α 2 t s t z z 2 where ts t z c is sediment temperature at time t s and depth z m below the swi c s j m 3 c 1 is the sediment thermal capacity per unit volume k w m 1 c 1 is the sediment thermal conductivity α k c s m 2 s 1 is the sediment thermal diffusivity we consider uniform and temporally constant sediment thermal properties i e cs α and k constant in t and z eq 1 is solved using a finite elements method imposing either the value of the temperature along the boundary dirichlet boundary condition bc or the value of the heat flux neumann bc imposition of the energy flux as bc at the swi allows us to account for the potential contribution of the residual solar radiation reaching the sediment bottom we solved eq 1 using a timestep of 5 minutes and a spatial discretization of 2 5 cm assuming homogeneous sediments we used eq 1 to characterize the sediment thermal diffusivity α piccolo et al 1993 we solved eq 1 by imposing the measured sediment temperature profile as ic and the sediment temperature measured at the uppermost and lowermost deployed sensors i e z 0 05 m and z 1 50 m depth as bc we explored a large number of values of α and determined the value that minimized the difference between measured and modeled sediment temperature at intermediate depths i e z 0 25 0 50 1 00 m the heat flux at the swi h s w i w m 2 assumed positive downward i e when entering the soil can be calculated using the sediment temperature data and eq 1 integrated from a prescribed lower boundary condition zlower to the swi z 0 m and solved considering the energy flux as the unknown harrison and phizacklea 1985 2 h s w i c s z l o w e r 0 t s t z t d z k t s t z z z l o w e r the first term on the right hand side of eq 2 represents the energy stored by the sediment between zlower and the swi in dt while the second term represents the energy flux at the lower boundary both these terms can be computed using the available temperature data knowing the flux at the swi we describe hswi as the sum of two components 3 h s w i t h s e d t h r e s t where h s e d w m 2 is the conductive heat flux at the swi due to the temperature gradient between water and sediment while h r e s w m 2 is the residual solar radiation reaching the bottom exploiting the position of the temperature sensors deployed at our measuring station we estimated the temperature gradient at the swi considering the water temperature assumed uniform in the entire water column see 4 1 for further discussion and the temperature measured by the uppermost sensor within the soil i e at z z u p p e r 0 05 m following this approach we model hsed as 4 h s e d t k 1 t w t t s t z u p p e r z u p p e r when t w t t s t z u p p e r 0 k 2 t w t t s t z u p p e r z u p p e r when t w t t s t z u p p e r 0 where k 1 w m 1 c 1 and k 2 w m 1 c 1 are two model parameters describing the conductive heat flux due to the temperature gradient at the swi we distinguish the case of flux directed downward i e when water temperature is higher than sediment temperature and upward i e when sediment temperature is higher than water temperature in order to consider the effects of possibly unstable conditions favoring the formation of convective cells the residual solar radiation hres at the bottom is computed as 5 h r e s t r 0 t e λ y t where r 0 t 1 a r s u n t w m 2 is the solar irradiance not reflected by the water surface a is the water surface albedo λ m 1 is the extinction coefficient representing the irradiance absorption per unit depth of the water column λ is time dependent being a function of water turbidity turbidity data are not available at our study site therefore we treat λ as a model parameter and find the value of λ that best represents on average water column conditions we performed the calibration of the model parameters using the random sampling technique testing several combination of parameters in order to identify the parameters combination that maximizes the agreement between hswi computed from the sediment temperature data using eq 2 and hswi modeled using eq 3 3 2 water temperature dynamics as we are dealing with a very shallow water environment we can assume the temperature to be uniform within the water column as shown also by our field observation see fig 4 we thus assume a single temperature value to represent the thermal state of the well mixed water column whose dynamics is described by the following equation 6 d t w t d t 1 c w t h n t where tw t c is the water column temperature c w t j c 1 m 2 is the thermal capacity of the water column h n t w m 2 is the net energy flux driving the water column dynamics the thermal capacity is given by c w t ρ w c p w y t where ρ w kg m 3 is water density c p w j kg 1 c 1 the water specific heat both assumed constants and y t m is the water depth the net incoming energy flux h n w m 2 is given by the sum of the horizontal and vertical energy fluxes affecting the water column we consider sediment in suspension to be in thermal equilibrium with water furthermore we assume the values of suspended sediment concentration characterizing shallow tidal environments and the venice lagoon in particular not high enough ssc never exceeds the order of magnitude of 10 2 mg l 1 in the venice lagoon see e g venier et al 2014 to affect the water thermal properties focusing on the vertical energy fluxes the contributions to hn consist on the following terms see sketch in fig 3 i short wave radiation solar irradiance not reflected by the water surface h s h o w m 2 partially absorbed by water according to beer s law integrated over the water column ii net incoming long wave radiation h l o n w m 2 which is the difference between radiation emitted by the atmosphere and fully absorbed by water and the long wave radiation emitted by the water column iii sensible heat flux h s e n w m 2 which is the convective heat flux exchanged at the awi iv latent heat flux h l a t w m 2 exchanged between water and atmosphere v conductive heat flux at the swi h s e d w m 2 exchanged between water and sediment the formulations used to evaluate the energy fluxes at the awi are described in appendix a in particular the long wave net radiation is computed following bignami et al 1995 formulation calibrated and tested using data from the mediterranean sea sensible and latent heat fluxes are computed following a simplified bulk parameterization based on the monin obukhov similarity theory fairall et al 2003 we assume heat transfer between the water column and the sediment suspended during a storm event to be negligible even during intense storm events erosion only affects a small volume of sediments a few mm at the swi carniello et al 2012 where it can be assumed to be in approximate thermal equilibrium with the overlying water a horizontal energy flux is generated by the advection of water by tidal and secondarily wind currents to estimate this flux a 2 d approach describing the full hydrodynamic circulation is needed however the aim of this study is to evaluate the relevance of hswi for the water temperature dynamics for which a simple 1 d approach focusing on the vertical energy balance of the water column is most appropriate experimental conditions were selected in order to ensure that horizontal energy exchanges were small see discussion in paragraph 2 1 to provide an appropriate test furthermore eq 6 can be used to compute on the basis of observed water temperature time series the net energy flux hn entering leaving the water column this flux can be compared with the sum of the vertical energy fluxes computed at the awi using the formulation in appendix a and evaluated at the swi using eq 2 the deviation obtained from this comparison allows the quantification of the potential importance of the advective component see paragraph 4 5 and to identify if and under what conditions such contribution may become important finally once the energy balance model is tested against observations advective energy flux components can be readily added using a model of shallow water flows it is also worth noting that we focus here on energy exchanges at the swi while we do not describe exchanges at the air sediment interface during low tides the study site was also chosen to minimize the occurrence of tidal flat emergence however the formulation presented here can be expanded to describe air sediment energy exchanges by properly adapting our formulation e g see approach in guarini et al 2000 3 3 temperature profile within the water sediment continuum coupling eqs 1 and 6 we develop and apply a point model for describing the energy transfer through the water sediment continuum that considers reflection scattering and absorption of radiative energy and conduction of heat in the vertical direction in order to apply the model we need an initial condition ic specifying the initial water temperature tw 0 and the initial vertical temperature profile within the sediment ts 0 z the value of the sediment thermal diffusivity α assumed to be constant along the vertical direction within the sediment column considered in our analysis the model parameters k 1 k 2 and λ necessary to compute the energy flux at the swi the meteorological data to be imposed as boundary condition bc for evaluating the energy fluxes at the awi in particular the required meteorological inputs are solar radiation at the water surface r s u n w m 2 air temperature tair c relative humidity hrel atmospheric pressure patm mbar wind speed v w i n d m s 1 fraction of cloud covered sky n sediment temperature at a prescribed depth within the sediments to be imposed as bc at the lower limit of the computational domain in the present analysis the ic and bc for the point model are derived from the observations collected at the measuring station more precisely we use the temperature profile at t 0 s as ic the time record of the sediment temperature at z 1 50 m as bc at the lower limit of the domain thus solving the sediment temperature dynamics only in the upper 1 5 m thick layer of sediments the use of a full set of observed ic and bc clearly undermines the possibility of using the model as a predictive tool as these type of data are typically not available particularly in the sediment column in order to limit the need of observations in the sediment column we propose to use as ic the vertical temperature profile provided by an analytical solution of the heat diffusion eq 1 that describes the daily mean temperature profile evolution over the year following nishri et al 2015 the analytical solution of 1 is 7 t s t z t 0 t a e x p z ω 2 α sin ω t l d z ω 2 α where t 0 c is the average annual temperature at the swi ta c is the amplitude of the annual temperature variation at the swi ω 2 π 365 25 d 1 is the annual angular frequency α m 2 d 1 is the sediment thermal diffusivity ld d is the phase shift we used the available sediment temperature data to calibrate the values of t 0 ta α and ld by maximizing the agreement between the computed and measured vertical mean daily temperature profile the calibrated value of α provides a further estimation of the sediment properties to be compared with that obtained using 1 in addition to providing a reliable ic for the vertical temperature profile within the bed sediment when temperature data are not available the analytical solution 7 allows to extend the ic to the depth below the swi where the sediment temperature is not affected by the seasonal temperature fluctuations for temperate latitudes and silty sand sediments typically z 10 m in this way the bc at the lower limit of the domain can be imposed assuming a constant value for the temperature equal to the mean annual temperature at the swi for the specific location 3 4 error parameters we

during a summer and a winter day in both cases we notice that i water temperature is uniform within the water column observation supported also by water temperature measurements collected in previous studies at other locations within the venice lagoon mav 2004 which supports the assumption of a uniform water layer to represent the thermal dynamics in the water see section 3 2 ii the temperature variation at the daily timescale affects only the topmost 30 50 cm of the sediment iii sediment temperature varies throughout the entire monitored sediment layer over seasonal time scales as illustrated by comparing a summer and a winter day in fig 4 iv in summer the mean temperature of the sediment is lower than the mean water temperature and the heat flux is on average directed from the water to the sediment while in winter the opposite pattern is observed 4 2 sediment thermal properties data collected during the field campaign were used to provide an initial characterization of the thermal properties of the tidal flat sediments thermal diffusivity α m 2 s 1 assumed uniform within the sediment i e we assume homogeneous bed sediment was estimated using eq 1 as described in paragraph 3 1 in particular we explored 104 different values of thermal diffusivity α in the range 10 7 α 10 6 m 2 s 1 we then determined the value of α that simultaneously minimized the rmse between measured and computed sediment temperature data at intermediate depths more precisely we minimized the following objective function 10 f t i r m s e 2 z i where rmse zi is the rmse between the measured and computed sediment temperature at zi z i 0 25 0 50 1 00 m we considered a moving time window of 15 days and determined for each time window the optimal value for α fig 5 a shows the frequency distribution of the values obtained for α from the calibration procedure ranging from 4 7 10 7 and 8 0 10 7 m 2 s 1 with a maximum rmse over all the periods considered of 0 25 c the results suggest that the most appropriate value for characterizing the sediment thermal diffusivity at our measuring station is α 6 0 10 7 m 2 s 1 the estimated value of thermal diffusivity is coherent with a silty sand kim et al 2007 a sediment characterization also confirmed by the analysis of sediment cores collected in situ by solving eq 1 using the identified value of α 6 0 10 7 m 2 s 1 for all the considered periods we obtained a good description of the temperature dynamics within the sediments yielding a maximum rmse of 0 3 c as confirmed by the scatter plots of modeled vs observed sediment temperature at different depths in fig 5 b and c based on the above sediment characterization we derived from kim et al 2007 the following values of thermal capacity per unit volume c s 3 00 10 6 j m 3 c 1 and thermal conductivity k c s α 1 8 w m 1 c 1 4 3 daily mean sediment temperature profile following the approach described in paragraph 3 3 we calibrated the parameters t 0 ta α ld in eq 7 by applying the random sampling technique to minimize the difference between the mean daily temperature derived from the data collected at the measuring station and those computed using eq 7 in particular we tested 106 random combinations of parameters within the following ranges 0 t 0 30 c 0 ta 20 c 0 α 0 1 m 2 d 1 150 l d 150 d we identified the best combination of the parameters as the combination that minimizes the target function 10 with z i 0 05 0 25 0 50 1 00 1 50 m fig 6 shows the results of the calibration highlighting the best values for the parameters fig 6 a and two sample comparisons of mean daily temperature profiles measured and computed following the calibration fig 6 b and c in table 2 we report the calibrated values of the parameters toward the goal of providing a reliable ic for the vertical temperature profile within the bed sediment when temperature data are not available the temperature profile computed using the analytical formula does favorably compare with the observed one as shown in fig 6 b and c the value of α obtained α 5 3 10 2 m 2 d 1 6 1 10 7 m 2 s 1 from the present calibration procedure well matches the value obtained following the procedure described in section 4 2 α 6 0 10 7 m 2 s 1 supporting the reliability of the previous analysis 4 4 heat flux at the swi once the sediment thermal properties were estimated 4 2 we computed the energy flux at the swi hswi from eq 2 properly discretized using the available sediment temperature data the computed flux hswi was then used to calibrate the parameters k 1 k 2 and λ of eq 3 we performed the calibration over 55 sliding window periods of 15 days using the random sampling technique we explored for each period 106 random parameter combinations e g see fig 5 a and b and looked for the values that maximized the efficiency of the model as described by the nash sutcliffe coefficient 9 the results of the calibration procedure revealed that the model better reproduces the process in summer and spring ns usually greater than 0 75 see fig 7 a and b while on average the values of the ns coefficient are lower in winter ns in the range 0 50 0 60 we ascribe this both to the lower amount of data available for the winter season see fig 2 which made the calibration procedure less robust and to the fact that during winter the computed flux at the swi is lower than in summer and spring such that energy advection within the sediment which we neglect in our 1 d approach might become more relevant focusing on the summer and spring periods we performed a frequency analysis of the calibration results fig 7 c clearly shows that our analysis identifies different values of k 1 and k 2 for the two seasons with larger values of both the parameters in spring this observation seems to suggest a seasonal variation of the parameters probably due to the different temperature characterizing the sediment and to the different stability conditions of the water column however the available data covering less than 1 year are not sufficient to confirm and define a clear seasonal trend the values of k 1 and k 2 we selected for modeling the heat flux at the swi are listed in table 3 the ratio k 2 k 1 is quite similar for the two seasons and equal to about 1 5 1 75 therefore with the same temperature gradient between water and sediment the energy flux is larger if directed towards the water we can ascribe this behavior to the different stability condition affecting the water column where the formation of convective cells might contribute to the column mixing thus increasing the capability of the water to absorb the heat provided by bed sediments the frequency analysis further shows that both in summer and spring the best value for parameter λ is larger than 7 m 1 this suggests that water turbidity at our study site is in general i e not only during storm events when suspended sediment concentration is increased by bed sediment entrainment carniello et al 2016 note that periods characterized by wind speed higher than 10 m s 1 represent only the 8 of our dataset high enough to absorb most of the incoming solar radiation such that the residual irradiance reaching the sediment surface hres is negligible i e from eq 3 hswi hsed this also explains why λ seems to be not well identified from the dotty plots in fig 7 a and b in fact when λ exceeds a threshold roughly λ 6 m 1 hres is negligible and no longer affects the results of the calibration our findings are consistent with persistent turbid water column conditions characterizing the venice lagoon carniello et al 2012 2014 venier et al 2014 and very shallow lakes subin et al 2012 fig 7 d provides two examples of the capability of eq 4 using the calibrated value of k 1 and k 2 listed in table 3 of reproducing the dynamics of the heat flux at the swi for both a summer and a spring period in particular in fig 7 d the flux is positive when directed toward the water column in order to estimate the relevance of the thermal interaction between water and sediments at the swi hsed on the energy balance of the water column we compared the hswi computed from eq 2 on the basis of the sediment temperature data being hswi hsed with the fluxes at the awi hsho hlon hsen hlat computed using the meteorological forcings as input for the formulas described in appendix a fig 8 shows a comparison of the contribution of each vertical energy flux to the total energy exchanged at the hourly and daily timescale for a summer fig 8 a and b and a winter fig 8 c and d period respectively the contribution of the flux to the energy balance is positive when it is directed toward the water column i e when the flux contributes at warming the water more precisely we show the hourly daily contribution of each energy flux normalized using the total energy exchanged i e the sum of the different contributions in absolute value for each hour day focusing on the daily timescale analysis fig 8 a and 8 c typically used in limnology we observe that in summer the most important fluxes are the short wave radiation hsho and the latent heat flux hlat in winter hsho still plays an important role but also the long wave energy flux hlon becomes important hswi represents the smallest term in the total energy balance never exceeding the 10 the hourly timescale analysis fig 8 b and d more consistent with our investigation shows that both in summer and winter hsho represents the most important contribution during the day in summer hlon and hlat play a relevant role by cooling the water and become the most important fluxes during nighttime the contribution of hswi is limited usually lower than 10 and never exceeding 20 the hourly timescale analysis also shows that on average the flux at the swi is directed toward the sediment in summer and toward the water column in winter these observations seem to suggest that for the considered study site the heat flux at the swi can be neglected when modeling the water column temperature dynamics we will further investigate this in section 4 6 based on the point model application on the contrary hswi is crucial for describing the sediment temperature dynamics 4 5 net energy flux relevance of the horizontal advection based on the measured water temperature time series we used eq 6 as described in paragraph 3 2 for computing the net flux hn exchanged by the water column at our study site with the surrounding domain following such an approach the computed data based hn necessarily accounts for both the horizontal and vertical heat fluxes we then compared the data based net energy flux hn with the energy flux obtained summing the computed vertical energy fluxes entering exiting the water column hnvert in particular h n v e r t h a w i h s e d where hawi is the sum of the energy fluxes at the awi hsho hlon hsen hlat computed using formulas from the literature see appendix a while hsed is the flux exchanged between water and sediment at the swi computed from the available sediment temperature data using eq 2 as described in the previous paragraph fig 9 a compares the two fluxes hn and hnvert over a 5 days long period while fig 9 b shows the comparison between the water temperature measured in the sea ts and at our measuring station inside the lagoon tl we observe that the dynamics of the two fluxes is similar but there are some marked differences mainly characterizing the flood tidal phase in particular the net energy flux hn is in this case lower than the sum of the vertical energy fluxes hnvert especially during flood phases occurred in the morning of the 3 rd 4 th and 5 th of august characterized by a quite large tidal excursion and a temperature of the sea quite lower than the lagoon temperature this observation suggests that the disagreement can be ascribed to the advective transport of colder water from the sea to the lagoon that is not accounted for in hnvert this is further confirmed by noting that the agreement between hn and hnvert is much better on august 1 st when ts and tl have much similar values fig 9 b the above observations suggest that in order to investigate the water and sediment temperature dynamics using a 1 d vertical approach such as the one described in the section 3 3 it is necessary to limit the analysis to the available period in which the horizontal advection is indeed negligible i e to neap tide periods i e small tidal oscillation and or periods in which the difference between water temperature at the sea and inside the lagoon are small 4 6 model application as discussed in the previous paragraph the point model we introduced in section 3 3 can be applied to reconstruct the sub diurnal water and sediment temperature dynamics when the horizontal advective energy fluxes are negligible although the study site was chosen in order to limit the importance of advection we found that its contribution to the total energy balance is often not negligible thus limiting the applicability of the proposed 1 d approach notwithstanding we identified in our dataset periods characterized by negligible horizontal energy transport i e periods characterized by a small tidal excursion and or similar water temperature at the sea and inside the lagoon periods highlighted in blue in fig 2 that we used to verify the capability of our point model to reproduce the temperature dynamics in the water sediment continuum and to further investigate the role of the energy flux at the swi hsed on the water temperature dynamics using parameter values obtained from the calibration described in paragraph 4 2 we applied the model to estimate the time evolution of the vertical temperature profile in the water sediment continuum driven by meteorological forcings we consider two alternative set ups in the first approach we impose a measured vertical temperature profile as ic and the following bc energy fluxes at the awi computed from observed meteorological data measured water level sediment temperature measured at the deepest sensor 1 5 m with reference to the swi in a second set of model runs we impose as ic the sediment temperature profile given by eq 7 and as lower bc a constant bed sediment temperature of 17 c the mean annual temperature at the swi as discussed in paragraph 4 3 at z 10 m with reference to the swi following this approach we do not need sediment temperature observations to perform our computations fig 10 shows sample results obtained by applying the model to reconstruct the temperature profile for a period of 5 days characterized by negligible advection considering the results obtained following the first approach red line we observe a quite good agreement between model results and observations for both the water temperature the rmse between observed and computed tw is 1 0 c while the value of the nash sutcliffe coefficient is 0 6 and the sediment temperature results at z 0 5 m are not shown as sediment temperature is constant this confirms the ability of the model to accurately describe the energy transfer processes and to correctly reproduce temperature dynamics in the water sediment column at the sub diurnal time scale results obtained imposing the analytical sediment temperature profile given by eq 7 as ic yellow line are quite similar to those obtained with the first approach in the upper part of the sediment and in the water column while the error characterizing the ic clearly affects the results deeper within the sediment interestingly the difference between observed sediment temperature and sediment temperature computed imposing as ic the temperature profile estimated using eq 7 decreases in time suggesting that the system and the model rapidly loses memory of the ic and converges to an accurate description of temperature dynamics we can conclude that the analytical solution of eq 1 provides a reasonably good approximation of the temperature profile within the sediment to be used as ic when sediment temperature data are not available further investigations on the time required by the system for loosing memory of the ic suggest that it never exceeds 5 days see supplementary material for further discussion fig 11 a shows the comparison between hsed computed using the temperature data to solve eq 2 being hsed hswi or provided by the model i e using eq 4 positive values of the energy flux correspond to a flux directed toward the water column the good agreement between the fluxes confirms the capability of the model to correctly reproduce the temperature dynamics at the swi fig 11 b compares the time evolution of the water temperature as measured blue line and computed either considering red line or neglecting yellow line hsed in the energy balance the agreement with measured data is clearly satisfactory but more interestingly the negligible difference between the results computed by considering or by neglecting the heat flux at the swi confirms that hsed is small compared with other fluxes contributing to the water column energy balance in order to generalize this observation the process deserves further investigation considering shallower less turbid locations under the effect of different meteorological forcings in closing it is worth noting that hsed remains crucial for describing the sediment temperature dynamics and the dynamics of the biochemical processes that take place within the first layer of sediment 5 summary and conclusions we collected temperature data within the water sediment continuum in a shallow water area in the venice lagoon italy we further developed a point energy balance model that solves for energy transfer processes in the water sediment continuum the model computes the energy fluxes at the air water and sediment water interface and hence the water sediment temperature dynamics and enables us to draw some interesting inferences from the observations observations show that the temperature in the water column is quite uniform in the vertical direction sediment temperature varies over daily time scales within the topmost 30 50 cm layer while seasonal scale temperature variations propagate throughout the entire 1 50 m layer of sediment investigated here under the investigated conditions the contribution of the residual solar radiation at the sediment water interface is found to be negligible the average water turbidity is such that most of the incoming solar radiation is either reflected at the surface or absorbed within the water column even when water depth is small y 0 3 m conductive heat flux is thus the chief energy transfer mechanism at the sediment water interface and crucial to model sediment temperature dynamics however this energy flux is found to play a minor role in determining water temperature dynamics conductive heat exchange at the water sediment interface is mostly less than 10 at the hourly timescale and mostly less than 5 at the daily timescale independently on the season this observation suggests the possibility to model the water temperature dynamics in shallow water environments only as forced by the heat fluxes at the air water interface using parameter values determined on the basis of our observations we applied the model to describe the dynamics of the temperature profile in the water sediment continuum the model applicability is strongly limited by the relevant role usually played by the advection but it properly represents the observed dynamics of the vertical temperature distribution when horizontal advective energy transport is negligible model applications further confirm that neglecting the heat flux at the swi minimally affects the capability of the model in correctly reproducing the water temperature dynamics the formulation presented and tested here constitutes a building block that can be readily incorporated into a fully spatial hydro morphodynamic model to provide a proper description of the energy transfer processes complete of horizontal advective dispersive transport e g carniello et al 2011 2012 2014 proper testing of such a fully spatial energy balance model will require temperature observations distributed in space and time e g through remote sensing and will contribute to further our predictive understanding of temperature dynamics

the vertical heat fluxes shown in fig 4 in order to compute the heat fluxes at the air water interface we used well known formulas widely studied in literature table a 4 lists the constants and variables appearing in the formulas used in the present study while table a 5 lists the formulas used to compute the heat fluxes at the awi we briefly discuss the formulas to compute the energy fluxes at the awi in the following paragraphs a1 short wave radiation the short wave flux h s h o w m 2 consists of the solar radiation absorbed by the water column the usual assumption is that the irradiance absorption by the water column follows an exponential function e g denman and miyake 1973 therefore the total energy budget absorbed by the water column is given by a 1 h s h o t r 0 t 1

862,transport processes in a physical model of a natural stream with a composite cross section compound channel are investigated by means of a lagrangian analysis based on nonlinear dynamical system theory two dimensional free surface eulerian experimental velocity fields of a uniform flow in a compound channel form the basis for the identification of the so called lagrangian coherent structures lagrangian structures are recognized as the key features that govern particle trajectories we seek for two particular class of lagrangian structures shear and shearless structures the former are generated whenever the shear dominates the flow whereas the latter behave as jet cores these two type of structures are detected as ridges and trenches of the finite time lyapunov exponents fields respectively besides shearlines computed applying the geodesic theory of transport barriers mark shear lagrangian coherent structures so far the detection of these structures in real experimental flows has not been deeply investigated indeed the present results obtained in a wide range of the controlling parameters clearly show a different behaviour depending on the shallowness of the flow shear and shearless lagrangian structures detected from laboratory experiments clearly appear as the flow develops in shallow conditions the presence of these lagrangian structures tends to fade in deep flow conditions keywords shear lagrangian structure shearless lagrangian structure ridges trenches ftle shearlines river dynamics 1 introduction natural rivers and quite often artificial channels are characterized by cross sections composed by a deeper main channel and shallower floodplains for this reason they are usually referred as compound channels flows of these streams are defined as predominantly horizontal since their horizontal dimensions greatly exceed the vertical one jirka 2001 the analysis of mixing processes in natural streams is not a simple task as flow dynamics is strongly affected by channel irregularities flow velocity in the floodplains is lower than the one of the main channel due to the water shallowness and to bed roughness typically higher than the main channel as a result of the velocity gradient shear occurs at the interface between the main channel and the floodplains the presence of various eulerian flow patterns most of which are characterized by large scale vortical structures with vertical axes i e macro vortices is well known socolofksy and jirka 2004 stocchino et al 2011 stocchino and brocchini 2010 the generation of these vortical structures can be described by two main approaches rowiński and radecki pawlik 2015 either as a shear instability at the junction of two streams van prooijen et al 2005 or as an outcome of differential energy dissipation of shallow water currents interacting with submerged obstacles soldini et al 2004 the former approach casts an analogy between the transitional region of the compound channel and a free mixing layer the latter identifies the driving mechanism for the generation and sustainment of the eulerian macro vortices in the vorticity generation owing to the depth jump across the cross section stocchino and brocchini 2010 showed that the shear layer thickness remains constant in compound channels such a condition is a peculiar consequence of the topographic forcing i e the depth jump generating the eulerian macro vortices on the contrary the shear layer generated by the junction of two streams on an even bottom tends to grow linearly in order to clarify strengths and shortcomings of both a detailed comparison between the approaches pursued by van prooijen et al 2005 and soldini et al 2004 should be carried out and the outcome of the numerical simulations compared however the issues raised by these two different approaches are not considered in the present work indeed we aim to analyse experimental surface velocity fields under a lagrangian perspective disregarding the eulerian approach note that it is well known that eulerian and lagrangian patterns do not always correspond haller 2015 an experimental investigation on the mixing processes in terms of lagrangian statistics of single and multiple particles was presented by stocchino et al 2011 however the role of flow inhomogeneity was disregarded in that study this aspect is the main subject of the present work where we aim to detect coherent patterns from lagrangian measures in order to seek structures that characterise the compound channel key structures are located at the transition from the main channel to the lateral channels floodplains and approximately along the axis of the main channel therefore we focus on lagrangian structures that shape trajectory patterns the present analysis mainly relies on the computations of the finite time lyapunov exponents ftle fields along with related trenches beron vera et al 2010 and ridges shadden et al 2005 as a first diagnostic tool however ftle trenches and ridges are not always a signature of the presence of material lines despite such a shortcoming they are still a valuable tool to understand the dynamics of the flow in particular ridges are able to reveal the regions of motion that are kinematically the most active allshouse and peacock 2015a we then manage to isolate two types of heuristic structures that are mostly disregarded in previous studies jet cores jc i e shearless structures and shear lagrangian structures sls respectively jc were studied by beron vera et al 2010 and farazmand et al 2014 in the present work we apply the methodology detailed in the former study based on ftle trenches besides we characterize the behaviour of heuristic jc resulting from ftle trenches by applying the methodology described by allshouse and peacock 2015b the same method is also applied to ridges of ftle fields that mark heuristic sls such a conclusion is proven by testing heuristic sls against their shear properties a further characterization of shear is carried out upon the rigorous definitions of lagrangian coherent structures lcs haller 2011 haller and beron vera 2012 among the general family of lcs sls are features dominated by a bulk shear typical of parallel flows herein sls are detected in order to mark the fundamental geometry of shear patterns note that sls and jc are usually defined and studied on the basis of analytical velocity fields whereas the main goal of the present study is to deeply investigate realistic flow conditions in a laboratory model of a typical river configuration heuristic sls calculated as ftle ridges and rigorous sls calculated from the geodesic theory of transport barriers are compared and a nice agreement is found summing up experimental data of time dependent two dimensional eulerian velocity fields stocchino et al 2011 stocchino and brocchini 2010 are employed to calculate numerical trajectories upon which jc and sls are estimated against their shear properties rigorous sls are also calculated as shearlines that minimize their geodesic deviation the paper proceeds with section 2 devoted to the definition and formulation of the lcs identification techniques then in section 3 we describe the velocity fields employed and we asses their two dimensionality section 4 describes in details the lcs that can be detected in shallow intermediate and deep flow conditions finally section 5 is devoted to the conclusions and closes the paper 2 theoretical background a fluid is usually studied applying the well known results of continuum mechanics and we follow this approach a fluid body b is made of elements called particles ξ in order to describe the position of these particles we establish a one to one correspondence between the particles and the coordinates of a reference system i e a triple of real numbers we introduce lagrangian coordinates ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 as a material coordinate system that label fluid particles since any two systems of coordinates are related by a continuously differentiable transformation we can introduce eulerian coordinates as 1 x φ t t 0 ξ where φ is the flow map the eulerian coordinates denote the position of a point fixed in what can be called the laboratory frame thiffeault and boozer 2001 the transformation showed in equation 1 can be inverted in the neighbour of a point provided that the jacobian exists and does not vanish aris 1962 the study of fluid flows cannot be carried out disregarding velocity fields indeed velocity fields are the core of fluid mechanics and time dependent velocity fields are generally written as v x t the trajectory of particles are curves solutions of 2 d x d t v x t with initial conditions x t 0 ξ ξ we can regard eq 2 as a set of ordinary differential equations and evaluate on a finite time interval t t 1 t 0 the distance that two initial close particles can experience therefore if we consider as initial conditions ξ 0 and ξ 0 ϵ we can evaluate the final distance between the two particles applying a linearisation allshouse and peacock 2015b 3 δ x t 1 φ t 1 t 0 ξ 0 φ t 1 t 0 ξ 0 ϵ φ t 1 t 0 ξ 0 ϵ where φ t 1 t 0 ξ 0 is called the flow map gradient and it is a tensor represented by a matrix the entries of which are φ j i x i ξ j we impose two restrictions on φ firstly an infinitesimal material element d x must not split along its evolution and coalescence of two material elements is not allowed this is the physical interpretation of the condition on the jacobian of eq 1 the second restriction imposes that the deformation must preserve orientation i e three right handed material elements d x d y and d z satisfying d x d y d z 0 are transformed into three material elements satisfying d x t d y t d z t φ d x φ d y φ d z det φ d x d y d z 0 by writing φ d x we denote the product between the matrix φ and the vector d x i e a contraction that results in a vector scalar product between vectors is indicated as the second restriction implies that the jacobian of eq 1 must satisfy the following condition 4 j det φ 0 the magnitude of the final distance can be evaluated as shadden et al 2005 5 δ x t 1 δ x t 1 δ x t 1 φ δ x t 0 φ δ x t 0 δ x t 0 c δ x t 0 ϵ c ϵ where c is the cauchy green tensor defined as c φ t φ where t denotes the transpose it is possible to prove that matrix c is positive definite and symmetric since we analyse 2d velocity fields c has two eigenvectors e 1 and e 2 associated with two eigenvalues 0 λ 1 λ 2 respectively maximum stretching occurs when δ x t 0 is chosen such that it is aligned with the eigenvector associated with the maximum eigenvalue of c i e 6 max δ x t 1 λ 2 δ x t 0 where indicates alignment with the eigenvector associated with the maximum eigenvalue λ 2 of the cauchy green tensor since δ x t 0 ϵ eq 6 can be recast to obtain 7 max δ x t 1 e σ t 0 t 1 t ϵ where 8 σ t 0 t 1 1 t log λ 2 represents the maximum finite time lyapunov exponent ftle calculated on a finite integration time t the eigenvectors of c define directions of initial separations for which neighbouring particles are converging or diverging since we are interested in the most active regions of the fluid flow from a kinematic point of view we define the ftle in eq 8 as a function of the maximum eigenvalue panel a of fig 1 shows the deformation in the neighboured of a point under the action of the flow map computation of ftle can be carried out in forward time i e from t 0 to t 0 t or in backward time i e from t 0 t to t 0 identification and classification of the main features of these scalar fields is the subject of the next paragraphs eckmann and ruelle 1985 showed how λ 2 tends asymptotically to a single value λ as time tends to infinity for ergodic systems the following results are strictly applicable to autonomous systems osseledec theorem 9 λ lim t log λ 2 2 t tang and boozer 1996 showed that at times t 1 λ the averaged ftle takes the form 10 λ a t b t λ where a and b are constants analogously the standard deviation behaves as 11 σ λ 1 t the probability density function must behave in agreement with the previous theoretical results i e as the integration time increases the pdf must narrow converging to a delta function abraham and bowen 2002 showed the consistency of these last theoretical results in an analysis carried out on the basis of surface velocity fields of a region of the east australian current lapeyre 2002 found narrowing pdfs as t increases due to the decrease of the standard deviation and a shift of the peaks towards smaller values due to the decaying turbulent field in time he analysed 2 1 detection and classification of the ftle features ridges and trenches lagrangian coherent structures have been broadly recognised as the main features that characterise transport in fluid flows ftle scalar fields have been largely adopted in order to seek for heuristic lagrangian coherent structures in particular ridges have been associated with the concept of stable and unstable manifolds ridges calculated in forward time are considered as a signature of repelling structures whereas ridges calculated in backward time as attracting structures shadden et al 2005 however such a representation is undermined by some known issues haller and yuan 2000 in particular ridges of ftle fields can mark heuristic sls this applies to the present case the transition region between the main channel and the floodplains is marked by such features as discussed in the following jc can be detected at the center of the main channel they mark absence of shear and inhibit cross channel transport such shearless barriers were found to strongly separate the fluid environment preventing exchange between the regions divided by them rypina et al 2007 samelson 1992 such structures were classified as invariant tori like lcs that are often present in geophysical flows beron vera et al 2010 since infinite time lyapunov exponents of invariant tori are zero and invariant tori computed in forward time coincide with invariant tori computed in backward time the heuristic identification of jc relies on trenches of ftle fields that coincide in forward and backward time evaluation of the most influential structures in ftle fields i e ridges and trenches is pursued considering the dynamical properties of these features green et al 2007 mathur et al 2007 ridges behave as attractors of trajectories solution of the dynamical system 12 d x d s σ t 0 t 0 t x where s is the arclength along the gradient lines of σ t 0 t 0 t x and the right hand side represents the spatial gradient of ftle scalar fields this property is at the base of the extraction algorithm proposed by mathur et al 2007 and here adopted the reliability of such a procedure was strengthen by peikert et al 2013 panel b of fig 1 shows the behaviour of ridges as attractors of trajectories solution of eq 12 the detection of trenches is analogue the computations are carried out considering d x d s σ t 0 t 0 t x since the methodology is the same in the following we refer only to ridges once the ridges are detected a hermite interpolation is adopted rovenski 2010 in order to locate first attempt ridges made of points equally spaced between them the advantage of hermite cubic interpolation is twofold tangent vectors of the points that form the curve can be chosen and monotony property of the function curve that is interpolated is generally preserved given points p 1 and p 2 and nonzero tangent vectors q 1 and q 2 the cubic hermite curve r s is defined as 13 r s 1 3 s 2 2 s 3 p 1 s 2 3 2 s p 2 s s 1 2 q 1 s 2 s 1 q 2 where 0 s 1 however the precision of the computed ridges is insufficient to allow for an accurate advection of these structures therefore the procedure described by allshouse and peacock 2015b is applied in order to refine the ridges following the cited approach points belonging to a ridge are detected with a relative precision of order 10 7 and their advection can be reliably computed the refinement process is schematically depicted in fig 2 and can be summarized as follows an initial ridge depicted in red in fig 2 i e the curve interpolated with the hermite polynomial is better approximated placing a number of test points at incremental distances δ at either sides of the ridge along the normal direction ftle values for all these points normal to the initial ridge are then evaluated and the point with the maximum ftle value is taken as the refined position of the ridge green points in fig 2 in case of trenches the revised position is chosen as the corresponding minimum ftle value this process is carried out recursively until a prescribed accuracy is reached once the final refined ridge is calculated it is possible to define a tangential unit vector τ0 to the ridge at time t 0 and a normal unit vector n0 evaluated with frenet serret formulas by applying the flow map gradient we can evaluate the advected tangential vector φτ0 and the advected normal vector φn0 in order to characterize the behaviour of ridges it is possible to evaluate the quantities described by allshouse and peacock 2015b the magnitudes of the advected normal and tangential vectors nl and el show stretching and contraction that occur to particles initially aligned along the ridge and initially perpendicular to the ridge respectively and can be written as 14 n l log φ n 0 15 e l log φ τ 0 similarly it is possible to compute the hyperbolic repulsion ρl and the lagrangian shear σl in order to characterize how the unit normal vector n0 deforms as 16 ρ l log n t φ n 0 17 σ l log τ t φ n 0 where nt and τt are unit normal and tangential vectors to the advected ridge fig 3 shows a pictorial representation of such quantities eqs 14 17 adopt a logarithmic scaling in order emphasize stretching a precise detection of the ridges is mandatory for a reliable computation of the quantities expressed by eqs 14 17 in particular when the flow map gradient is applied to τ0 trenches of ftle fields are characterized adopting the same measures the predominant shear character of ridges is confirmed if σl is greater than ρl along the majority of their length on the contrary jc must present very small σl and vanishing ρl along the majority of their length 2 2 shear lagrangian coherent structures recent developments in the field of lagrangian structures cleared that not all ftle ridges are material lines haller and beron vera 2012 developed a consistent theory in order do detect material lines that act as transport barriers of particular interest are material lines that attract or repel nearby fluid over a finite time interval the normal repulsion rate introduced in the previous section evaluates such a condition logarithmic scaling is not essential in the definition necessary and sufficient criteria for the existence of repelling and attracting lcs over a finite time interval are described in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the cauchy green tensor adopting a variational argument haller and beron vera 2012 showed that a curve is a hyperbolic transport barrier whether it is a trajectory of the autonomous differential equation 18 r e 1 such trajectories are defined strainlines after haller and beron vera 2012 considering a generic point p the least stretching geodesic at p under the cauchy green tensor is the geodesic starting from p with a unit tangent vector expressed by eq 18 in the framework of this work the predominant features of the flow are characterised by shear the material lines shear lcs that maximize lagrangian shear σ τ t φ n 0 are curves everywhere tangent to the shear vector field η hadjighasem et al 2013 haller and beron vera 2012 defined as 19 η λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 e 1 λ 1 λ 1 λ 2 e 2 open curves tangent to the shear vector field of eq 19 are shear lcs i e a shear transport barrier is a trajectory of the autonomous differential equation 20 r η such trajectories are defined shearlines after haller and beron vera 2012 positive lagrangian shear signals clockwise deformation while negative lagrangian shear signals counterclockwise deformation in the local coordinate frame e 1 e 2 the most prominent shear lcs are shearlines that minimize the geodesic shear deviation hadjighasem et al 2013 haller and beron vera 2012 along their length the pointwise closeness of shear lcs to least stretching geodesics can be computed in terms of invariants of the cauchy green tensor the geodesic deviation evaluates the difference of tangents plus the difference of curvatures of a shear lcs from the least stretching geodesic of the cauchy green tensor haller and beron vera 2012 provide an explicit formula in order to evaluate the geodesic deviation which reads 21 d g η 1 λ 2 λ 2 1 λ 2 λ 2 e 1 2 λ 2 1 λ 2 λ 2 e 2 1 λ 2 3 λ 2 5 2 λ 2 3 1 λ 2 3 κ 1 λ 2 5 1 λ 2 2 1 λ 2 λ 2 2 1 λ 2 κ 2 1 λ 2 with e 2 denoting the eigenvector associated with λ 2 κ 1 the curvature of the strainline and κ 2 the curvature of e 2 vector field the predominant shear lcs is chosen as the shearline whose average geodesic deviation 22 avg d g η d g η r d s r d s is the least among all computations of ftle fields and shear lcs are carried out following onu et al 2015 and farazmand and haller 2012 a matlab toolbox was made publicly available by these authors and it has been here exploited 3 experimental flow field the present analysis is based on the experimental measurements of the free surface eulerian velocity fields described in stocchino and brocchini 2010 and stocchino et al 2011 herein we briefly recall the main characteristics of the apparatus and of the measuring system the flume was 20 m long 60 cm wide and the trapezoidal cross section was composed by a central main channel w m c 20 cm two lateral flat floodplains w f p 18 cm and a transition region w t r 2 5 cm fig 4 shows the cross section of the flume velocity measurements have been performed by means of a two dimensional particle image velocimetry system on a field of view of 1 2 0 6 m2 the acquisition rate was between 100 hz and 250 hz depending on the flow velocity each acquisition was made of a number of frames between 2000 and 4000 several series of experiments have been carried out spanning a quite large range of values of the main physical parameters in table 1 we summarize the experimental conditions providing the values of the ratio between the main channel water depth hmc and that of the floodplains hfp r h h m c h f p and the froude number f r u m g r where r is the hydraulic radius g is gravity and um is the peak velocity in the main channel moreover s represents the longitudinal bed slope we keep the same distribution of the flow regimes depending on rh introduced in nezu et al 1999 and used in stocchino et al 2011 as pointed out by nezu et al 1999 three different flow regimes can be identified depending on the value of rh for rh 3 the flow is defined as shallow in this case intense velocity gradients occur at the transition between the main channel and the floodplains leading to a strong shearing and a generation of vorticity associated with the flow depth jump soldini et al 2004 for values of rh 2 the flow is defined as deep characterized by a weaker shear in the transition region the flow depth jump in this case is unable to greatly influence the free surface flow finally intermediate flows are defined when 2 rh 3 in the framework of their analysis stocchino et al 2011 evaluated single and multiple particles statistics since a constant mean velocity causes the absolute dispersion to increase quadratically in time and thus the diffusivity to increase linearly in time their analysis was carried out removing a constant mean from the velocity field in the case of compound channel flows a mean motion does exist in the stream wise direction and it is non homogeneous over the cross section the mean stream wise velocity assumes a bell like distribution as shown in stocchino and brocchini 2010 and its shape depends strongly on the flow depth ratio rh as a result for a 2d flow evolving in the plane the residual velocity reads as 23 u x y t u x y t u x y where u x y indicates the velocity averaged over the duration of the single realization this method is adequate to handle flows that are inhomogeneous like in the present case or in oceanographic applications while the classical results of taylor were obtained assuming u x y 0 i e for homogeneous flows the analysis is then carried out upon such velocity field in agreement with stocchino et al 2011 sls and jc have been computed on the entire dataset however for the sake of clarity we will discuss in details one run of each class showing the recurrent features of every corresponding class 3 1 assessment of two dimensionality in the framework of the present work the fluid flow is considered two dimensional indeed the measurements presented in stocchino and brocchini 2010 and stocchino et al 2011 were taken on the free surface assuming that the flow is mainly two dimensional this experimental approach based on the free surface velocity measurement is often used in many experimental works with primary focus on quasi 2d vortical structures see jirka 2001 nikora et al 2007 socolofksy and jirka 2004 among others this approach is valid as long as the secondary flows can be considered negligible in the formation of the quasi 2d vortical structures with vertical axis of rotation and confined in a layer close to the bottom however in order to verify this hypothesis the lagrangian divergence is here evaluated in particular mathur et al 2007 define lagrangian divergence as 24 l x t 0 t 1 v φ t 0 t ξ d t where v u in the present case the lagrangian divergence is computed along particle paths and should be zero for purely 2d flows it represents the factor by which infinitesimal areas are magnified fig 5 shows a typical snapshot of l x for a shallow flow case the lagrangian divergence presents a quite flat distribution with the only exception of few peaks located at the transition region the overall values are well below unity and much smaller than the ones found by mathur et al 2007 in a rotating water tank where the flow is considered manly two dimensional this measure is also employed by wilson et al 2013 in a turbulent boundary layer in order to quantify its two dimensionality they found a mean value of exp l close to 1 2 over their entire domain arguing that stretching along one direction is balanced by convergence in another direction further considerations led them to accept the flow as two dimensional besides divergence free flows have ftle fields non negative arnold 1992 lipinski and mohseni 2010 therefore an indirect proof of the low three dimensionality of the flow can be obtained inspecting ftle fields as showed in the following sections negative ftle values are very few therefore the assumption of two dimensionality can be fully accepted 4 results four experimental cases are reported in detail as prototypical examples of the respective flow conditions shallow flows intermediate flows and deep flows in the case of intermediate flows two regimes have been further investigated namely flow in subcritical and supercritical conditions the integration time is set to one second in order to let particle stay inside the computational domain furthermore such an integration time has the same order of magnitude of the lagrangian decorrelation time evaluated by stocchino et al 2011 on the same dataset it is worthy to recall the theoretical analysis reported in haller and beron vera 2012 where the authors studied a parallel shear flow as a benchmark case in particular the velocity field of the shear flow investigated takes the form 25 x u y t 26 y v y on a planar domain with non vanishing and non linear time averaged shear a y t 0 t u y τ d τ 0 and da y dy 0 one of the main conclusions of the work by haller and beron vera 2012 was that in such a framework any horizontal line is a shear lcs despite several important differences it is possible to cast an analogy between the above flow and the compound channel flows here discussed indeed although both velocity components are time dependent in the case of compound channels the shear pattern heuristically conforms to the parallel shear flow described by eqs 25 and 26 since shear lcs do develop in the stream wise direction and are advected in the same direction in particular the expected pattern must be symmetric with respect to the axis of the channel because the residual velocity eq 23 upon which eq 2 is solved determines a flow direction of the main channel reversed with respect to the floodplains fig 6 shows a pictorial representation of shear lcs marking positive and negative shear which can be detected in compound channels at the transition between the main channel and the floodplains indeed the bottom region of the figure shows positive shear whereas the top region negative shear defined in agreement with the convention adopted for eq 20 a shearless structure is present along the axis of the main channel marking a jc the main channel is characterized by low values of ftle fields and trenches can be detected this is the typical configuration resulting from a bell shaped velocity profile in the following we present the main results obtained starting from a general description of the behaviour of the ftle fields and then go forward with a detailed description of the lagrangian structures depending on the flow regime 4 1 general behaviour of ftle fields coherent patterns are firstly detected through ftle fields and they are found to behave in agreement with eqs 10 and 11 by choosing 12 different initial conditions and evaluating ftle fields with integration times varying from 0 1 to 5 7 s we can obtain the results plotted in fig 7 this figure shows two bundles of 12 curves representing the average and the standard deviation of the values of ftle fields as a function of the integration time note that the different curves are so closed to each other that can be hardly identified separately the trends of both quantities average and standard deviation are in agreement with the expected theoretical results for ergodic systems showing a monotonic decay in time as predicted by abraham and bowen 2002 moreover the probability density function pdf of the ftle are expected to behave accordingly in particular as the integration time increases the pdf tends to a dirac delta centered at the limit ftle value see fig 8 owing to the two dimensionality of the flow at hand it is reasonable to expect that ftle values are mainly positive leading to positively skewed pdfs 4 2 shear and shearless structures in shallow conditions experiment 201 is considered as a prototypical case of shallow conditions since it was carried out with a ratio r h 4 16 note that the flow for this case is in subcritical regime f r 0 60 fig 9 shows typical lagrangian patterns of shallow flow conditions panel a and b depict a snapshot of the forward and backward ftle fields evaluated at t 5 0 s respectively both forward and backward fields show structures at the transition from the main channel to the lateral floodplains upon each field three main structures depicted in black are identified and their ridges isolated at the center of the main channel trenches are identified and depicted in red in order to prove the predominant shear character of ridges the magnitude of the advected unit normal and tangential vectors are computed taking advantage of eqs 14 and 15 besides repulsion and lagrangian shear are evaluated applying eqs 16 and 17 figs 10 and 11 show such quantities as a function of the curvilinear coordinated s along forward and backward ridges respectively in all cases the growth of the normal vectors is greater than the growth of the tangential vectors i e nl is greater then el the growth of the normal vector n0 is predominantly due to lagrangian shear since σl is greater than ρl along each ridge for almost their entire length ridge c belonging to the forward field of fig 9 panel a shows some noisy signal in the hyperbolic repulsion depicted in fig 10 this behaviour is all but surprising since it is encountered even from dataset resulting from numerical simulations allshouse and peacock 2015b these quantitative results suggest that material elements initially aligned along ftle ridges will tend to move consistently without significant elongations on the contrary material elements initially perpendicular to the ridges will stretch because of shear trenches of ftle fields are identified at the center of the main channel where low ftle values appear these trenches behave as jc showing absence of shear panel a of fig 12 shows that nl and el are almost zero along the entire length of both jc evaluated from forward and backward fields this means that along jc unit normal and tangential vectors are not significantly deformed panel b show that ρl is almost zero whereas σl is very small this reflects the fact that unit normal vectors do not deform and their projection along the tangential direction to the ridge is negligible ftle ridges are nicely in agreement with shearlines fig 13 shows positive shear vector field in the lower part of the domain in blue and negative shear vector field in the upper part of the domain in red shear vector fields and shearlines are computed through eqs 19 and 20 respectively the corresponding positive and negative shearlines are superimposed on the corresponding areas this particular pattern is due to the symmetry of the problem clockwise shear in the lower part of the domain is reflected in counterclockwise shear in the upper part of the domain see for comparison fig 6 fig 14 shows the predominant shear lcs in black that minimize the geodesic deviation forward ridges of fig 9 are plotted in green and backward ridges in blue they are not perfectly aligned with shear lcs since the eigenvectors associated with maximum eigenvalues differ from the shear vector field however their alignment is remarkable jc are depicted in red and are located at the center of the main channel they do not perfectly superimpose increasing the integration time should lead to a better superposition however this leads to an accumulation of particles to the boundaries resulting in a splintering of the ridges as a result the integration time is kept to one second 4 3 shear and shearless structures in intermediate conditions subcritical case experiment 207 was carried out with a ratio r h 2 26 and it belongs to intermediate and subcritical conditions f r 0 73 it is analyzed as a reference configuration for this type of flows ftle fields show in general a pattern comparable to shallow conditions even if high ftle regions protrude towards lateral channels fig 15 shows the ftle field and represents the general configuration of interest for forward and backward fields seven predominant ridges are identified in forward time and two in backward time their behaviour is characterized with the same procedure followed in the previous section analogously to the shallow case lagrangian shear is predominant to repulsion as depicted in figs 16 and 17 classifying these ridges as sls compared to the shallow case higher values of ftle are obtained in the floodplains such values could reach peaks comparable to those of the transition region see panel a of fig 15 at the center of the main channel trenches of ftle fields are identified fig 18 quantifies shear properties of such trenches and qualifies them as jc showing results analogue to those of experiment 201 however the extension of the region where low ftle values are present contracts fig 19 shows positive shear vector field in the lower part of the domain in blue and negative shear vector field in the upper part of the domain in red with a pattern analogous to the previous case fig 20 shows the shear lcs that minimize the geodesic deviation alongside ridges and trenches shear lcs do align along longitudinal ftle ridges jc identified in both forward and backward fields superimpose much better than in the case of experiment 201 4 4 shear and shearless structures in intermediate conditions supercritical case experiment 105 was carried out with a ratio r h 2 15 belonging to intermediate and supercritical conditions f r 1 05 ftle fields show in general a pattern comparable to intermediate and subcritical conditions fig 21 shows the ftle field representing the general configuration of interest for forward and backward fields four predominant ridges are identified in forward time and two in backward time higher ftle values are located at the transition region however some ridges do not completely align along the stream wise direction in particular ridges c of panel a and b of panel b of fig 21 tend to align diagonally with respect to the stream wise direction as a result for these specific ridges lagrangian shear is not always predominant over hyperbolic repulsion figs 22 and 23 show that the magnitude of the advected normal is always greater than the magnitude of the advected tangential vector for all the ridges such predominance is due to lagrangian shear except for the ridges with diagonal alignment therefore we do not classify these ridges as sls since they show for a non negligible length a hyperbolic behaviour very well defined trenches are detected at the center of the main channel fig 24 shows the shear properties of these trenches that qualify as jc with negligible shear fig 25 shows positive shear vector field in the lower part of the domain in blue and negative shear vector field in the upper part of the domain in red with a pattern analogous to the previous case fig 26 shows the shear lcs that minimize the geodesic deviation these shear lcs align with ridges of ftle fields except for ridges c of panel a and b of panel b of fig 21 this explains why hyperbolic repulsion is predominant over lagrangian shear along some portions of these ridges on the contrary jc are very well superimposed 4 5 shear and shearless structures in deep conditions experiment 213 was carried out with a ratio r h 1 68 and in subcritical conditions f r 0 82 it is analysed as a reference configuration for deep flow conditions ftle fields show in general a pattern with the absence of persistent structures fig 27 shows the ftle field representing the general configuration of interest for forward and backward fields in deep conditions the ftle field is less readable and regions with high ftle values protrude towards the inner of the main channel four predominant ridges are identified in forward time and two in backward time their behaviour is characterized with the same procedure followed in the previous sections analogously to the previous cases lagrangian shear is predominant to repulsion as depicted in fig 28 for ridges that are mainly longitudinal i e a and c of the forward field panel a of fig 27 transverse ridges b and d show on the contrary comparable lagrangian shear and repulsion strength and consequently cannot be classified as a sls such a behaviour showed in fig 29 characterizes even ridge b belonging to the backward field panel b of fig 27 trenches are located at the center of the main channel however the width of the low ftle region has shrunk significantly compared to the previous cases as a result trenches tend to be interrupted by higher values of ftle fig 30 quantifies the shear properties of these trenches that can be consequently classified as jc fig 31 shows positive shear vector field in the lower part of the domain in blue and negative shear vector field in the upper part of the domain in red with a pattern analogous to the previous case fig 32 shows the shear lcs that minimize the geodesic deviation these shear lcs do align along longitudinal ftle ridges jc do superimpose as expected as a general comment of such a flow condition it is possible to argue a strong independence of the surface flow from the depth jump indeed transition region from the main channel to the floodplains is not clearly marked by high ftle regions as in the previous cases furthermore the presence of jc is not continuous along the stream wise direction 5 discussion and concluding remarks this work aims to detect shear and shearless lagrangian coherent structures in compound channels finite time lyapunov exponent fields are calculated on the basis of eulerian velocity fields measured via piv stocchino et al 2011 stocchino and brocchini 2010 and they unveil the most active regions of the fluid flow from a kinematic point of view from a methodological perspective ridges and trenches of ftle fields are obtained combining the best methods found in literature algorithm proposed by mathur et al 2007 hermite interpolation by haller 2011 recovered in a simplified version from rovenski 2010 owing to a predominant linearity of ridges and trenches along the stream wise direction refinement process proposed by allshouse and peacock 2015b note that the eulerian velocity fields were collected during an experimental campaign whereas most applications concern analytical or numerical models this reinforce the idea that this lagrangian measure is a robust tool that can be applied to realistic and complex flow fields the main parameters controlling the flow under investigation are the depth ratio rh i e the ratio between the depth of the main channel and the depth of the floodplains and the froude number the first parameter defines the shallowness of the flow whereas the second the critical conditions the results suggest a strong influence of the depth ratio on the establishment of persistent lagrangian patterns whereas the froude number do not seem to be an important controlling parameter however our dataset does not present supercritical flows for the shallow conditions and the highest froude number is 1 07 for the intermediate conditions therefore the relevance of our results mainly concerns the influence of the depth ratio in shallow flow conditions ftle fields show active regions at the transition from the main channel to the lateral floodplains marked by high ftle values regions of small ftle values at the center of the main channel are also present the former are associated with ridges whereas the latter with trenches ridges mark shear lagrangian structures that maximize lagrangian shear and trenches shearless lagrangian structures that behave as jet cores such a configuration is kept even in intermediate conditions however it is possible to observe that ftle ridges protrude more in the floodplains the analysis performed on the resulting ridges in order to assess whether hyperbolic repulsion or lagrangian shear are predominant suggests that ridges aligned along the stream wise direction show predominance of lagrangian shear over hyperbolic repulsion on the contrary ridges that are aligned diagonally with respect to the stream wise direction show portions of their length where hyperbolic repulsion is predominant over lagrangian shear the clear separation between the main channel and the floodplains shades by decreasing the flow depth ratio and reaching deep flow conditions as a result the presence of shear and shearless lagrangian structures detected from ftle fields is less readable it is still possible to recover some features but their persistence is less evident the peculiar pattern of shallow and intermediate conditions strongly influences transport as fig 33 exemplifies green dots represent tracers advected by the flow panels a c e and g represent initial conditions of particles superimposed on forward ftle fields panels b d f and h represent final conditions resulting from the advection process superimposed on corresponding forward ftle fields note that forward ftle fields are usually associated with repelling structures however a negligible hyperbolic repulsion was detected for ridges aligned along the stream wise direction in the previous paragraphs panels a f refer to shallow and intermediate conditions these clearly show the shear character of ridges at the transition region due to the fact that the initial distance between particles is not kept constant by the advection process by decreasing rh the shear character persists but with less strength jet cores at the centre of the main channel preserve the initial spacing between the particles panels g and h refer to deep conditions and they show that the shear strength tends to be lost this analysis gives an integrated point of view over a finite time interval of the previous work carried out by stocchino and brocchini 2010 and stocchino et al 2011 the influence of the eulerian macrovortices that develop mainly in shallow conditions cf fig 4 of stocchino et al 2011 can be directly observed in the meandering pattern that particles show in such a flow see panel b of fig 33 however eulerian and lagrangian diagnostics are conceptually different haller 2015 since the former refer to an instantaneous time instance whereas the latter to a finite time interval therefore a direct matching is impossible to reach ridges of ftle fields marking heuristic sls conform to rigorous sls calculated adopting the geodesic theory of transport barriers haller and beron vera 2012 such sls are aligned along the stream wise direction with a symmetric pattern positive sls are located in the bottom part of the domain and negative sls are located in the upper part of the domain however sls are always aligned along the stream wise direction decreasing rh down to a value typical of deep flow conditions sls conform to shallow and intermediate conditions however the results should be considered jointly with the fact that ftle fields are less significant and do not show strong persistent patterns this fact reflects the different velocity profiles that are recovered in the different depth flow conditions along a cross section fig 2 of stocchino and brocchini 2010 shows that peak velocities in the main channel and in the floodplains are comparable at deep flow conditions therefore ftle fields prove to be once again a valuable tool in order to assess the behaviour of a fluid flow giving an immediate understanding of the strength of the mixing pattern and the most active regions of the domain however these active areas need to be well characterized by the evaluation of the lagrangian shear and the hyperbolic repulsion to further understand the dynamics sls are detected in order to depict the shear pattern the joint analysis of ftle fields and sls manage to unveil the mixing pattern thoroughly since the shortcomings of one measure are balanced by strengths of the other besides the presence of jc at the center of the main channel impacts on tracer advection these results are of evident importance in riverine and estuarine analysis since these structures mark regions where particles undergo different fates for example evaluation of concentration distributions employed in the advection diffusion equation must carefully take into account the inhomogeneity resulting from sls and jc as a result turbulent diffusivity can vary on the spatial domain besio et al 2012 especially across regions delimited by sls and jc natural streams or estuaries usually show several regions that adapt to the framework of this work the presence of analogue structures is quite likely therefore lcs should mark the natural boundaries along which diffusivities could dramatically change their magnitude further research is needed to clearly connect the eulerian properties of the flow with its intrinsic lagrangian features indeed the compound channel geometry leads to the generation of eulerian vortical structures the appearance of which is strongly dependent on the flow depth ratio the present results suggest that a similar relationship is found when lagrangian coherent structures are studied a link between the two frameworks based on the spectral properties of eulerian velocity fields and ftle fields would then be desirable supplementary material supplementary material associated

862,transport processes in a physical model of a natural stream with a composite cross section compound channel are investigated by means of a lagrangian analysis based on nonlinear dynamical system theory two dimensional free surface eulerian experimental velocity fields of a uniform flow in a compound channel form the basis for the identification of the so called lagrangian coherent structures lagrangian structures are recognized as the key features that govern particle trajectories we seek for two particular class of lagrangian structures shear and shearless structures the former are generated whenever the shear dominates the flow whereas the latter behave as jet cores these two type of structures are detected as ridges and trenches of the finite time lyapunov exponents fields respectively besides shearlines computed applying the geodesic theory of transport barriers mark shear lagrangian coherent structures so far the detection of these structures in real experimental flows has not been deeply investigated indeed the present results obtained in a wide range of the controlling parameters clearly show a different behaviour depending on the shallowness of the flow shear and shearless lagrangian structures detected from laboratory experiments clearly appear as the flow develops in shallow conditions the presence of these lagrangian structures tends to fade in deep flow conditions keywords shear lagrangian structure shearless lagrangian structure ridges trenches ftle shearlines river dynamics 1 introduction natural rivers and quite often artificial channels are characterized by cross sections composed by a deeper main channel and shallower floodplains for this reason they are usually referred as compound channels flows of these streams are defined as predominantly horizontal since their horizontal dimensions greatly exceed the vertical one jirka 2001 the analysis of mixing processes in natural streams is not a simple task as flow dynamics is strongly affected by channel irregularities flow velocity in the floodplains is lower than the one of the main channel due to the water shallowness and to bed roughness typically higher than the main channel as a result of the velocity gradient shear occurs at the interface between the main channel and the floodplains the presence of various eulerian flow patterns most of which are characterized by large scale vortical structures with vertical axes i e macro vortices is well known socolofksy and jirka 2004 stocchino et al 2011 stocchino and brocchini 2010 the generation of these vortical structures can be described by two main approaches rowiński and radecki pawlik 2015 either as a shear instability at the junction of two streams van prooijen et al 2005 or as an outcome of differential energy dissipation of shallow water currents interacting with submerged obstacles soldini et al 2004 the former approach casts an analogy between the transitional region of the compound channel and a free mixing layer the latter identifies the driving mechanism for the generation and sustainment of the eulerian macro vortices in the vorticity generation owing to the depth jump across the cross section stocchino and brocchini 2010 showed that the shear layer thickness remains constant in compound channels such a condition is a peculiar consequence of the topographic forcing i e the depth jump generating the eulerian macro vortices on the contrary the shear layer generated by the junction of two streams on an even bottom tends to grow linearly in order to clarify strengths and shortcomings of both a detailed comparison between the approaches pursued by van prooijen et al 2005 and soldini et al 2004 should be carried out and the outcome of the numerical simulations compared however the issues raised by these two different approaches are not considered in the present work indeed we aim to analyse experimental surface velocity fields under a lagrangian perspective disregarding the eulerian approach note that it is well known that eulerian and lagrangian patterns do not always correspond haller 2015 an experimental investigation on the mixing processes in terms of lagrangian statistics of single and multiple particles was presented by stocchino et al 2011 however the role of flow inhomogeneity was disregarded in that study this aspect is the main subject of the present work where we aim to detect coherent patterns from lagrangian measures in order to seek structures that characterise the compound channel key structures are located at the transition from the main channel to the lateral channels floodplains and approximately along the axis of the main channel therefore we focus on lagrangian structures that shape trajectory patterns the present analysis mainly relies on the computations of the finite time lyapunov exponents ftle fields along with related trenches beron vera et al 2010 and ridges shadden et al 2005 as a first diagnostic tool however ftle trenches and ridges are not always a signature of the presence of material lines despite such a shortcoming they are still a valuable tool to understand the dynamics of the flow in particular ridges are able to reveal the regions of motion that are kinematically the most active allshouse and peacock 2015a we then manage to isolate two types of heuristic structures that are mostly disregarded in previous studies jet cores jc i e shearless structures and shear lagrangian structures sls respectively jc were studied by beron vera et al 2010 and farazmand et al 2014 in the present work we apply the methodology detailed in the former study based on ftle trenches besides we characterize the behaviour of heuristic jc resulting from ftle trenches by applying the methodology described by allshouse and peacock 2015b the same method is also applied to ridges of ftle fields that mark heuristic sls such a conclusion is proven by testing heuristic sls against their shear properties a further characterization of shear is carried out upon the rigorous definitions of lagrangian coherent structures lcs haller 2011 haller and beron vera 2012 among the general family of lcs sls are features dominated by a bulk shear typical of parallel flows herein sls are detected in order to mark the fundamental geometry of shear patterns note that sls and jc are usually defined and studied on the basis of analytical velocity fields whereas the main goal of the present study is to deeply investigate realistic flow conditions in a laboratory model of a typical river configuration heuristic sls calculated as ftle ridges and rigorous sls calculated from the geodesic theory of transport barriers are compared and a nice agreement is found summing up experimental data of time dependent two dimensional eulerian velocity fields stocchino et al 2011 stocchino and brocchini 2010 are employed to calculate numerical trajectories upon which jc and sls are estimated against their shear properties rigorous sls are also calculated as shearlines that minimize their geodesic deviation the paper proceeds with section 2 devoted to the definition and formulation of the lcs identification techniques then in section 3 we describe the velocity fields employed and we asses their two dimensionality section 4 describes in details the lcs that can be detected in shallow intermediate and deep flow conditions finally section 5 is devoted to the conclusions and closes the paper 2 theoretical background a fluid is usually studied applying the well known results of continuum mechanics and we follow this approach a fluid body b is made of elements called particles ξ in order to describe the position of these particles we establish a one to one correspondence between the particles and the coordinates of a reference system i e a triple of real numbers we introduce lagrangian coordinates ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 as a material coordinate system that label fluid particles since any two systems of coordinates are related by a continuously differentiable transformation we can introduce eulerian coordinates as 1 x φ t t 0 ξ where φ is the flow map the eulerian coordinates denote the position of a point fixed in what can be called the laboratory frame thiffeault and boozer 2001 the transformation showed in equation 1 can be inverted in the neighbour of a point provided that the jacobian exists and does not vanish aris 1962 the study of fluid flows cannot be carried out disregarding velocity fields indeed velocity fields are the core of fluid mechanics and time dependent velocity fields are generally written as v x t the trajectory of particles are curves solutions of 2 d x d t v x t with initial conditions x t 0 ξ ξ we can regard eq 2 as a set of ordinary differential equations and evaluate on a finite time interval t t 1 t 0 the distance that two initial close particles can experience therefore if we consider as initial conditions ξ 0 and ξ 0 ϵ we can evaluate the final distance between the two particles applying a linearisation allshouse and peacock 2015b 3 δ x t 1 φ t 1 t 0 ξ 0 φ t 1 t 0 ξ 0 ϵ φ t 1 t 0 ξ 0 ϵ where φ t 1 t 0 ξ 0 is called the flow map gradient and it is a tensor represented by a matrix the entries of which are φ j i x i ξ j we impose two restrictions on φ firstly an infinitesimal material element d x must not split along its evolution and coalescence of two material elements is not allowed this is the physical interpretation of the condition on the jacobian of eq 1 the second restriction imposes that the deformation must preserve orientation i e three right handed material elements d x d y and d z satisfying d x d y d z 0 are transformed into three material elements satisfying d x t d y t d z t φ d x φ d y φ d z det φ d x d y d z 0 by writing φ d x we denote the product between the matrix φ and the vector d x i e a contraction that results in a vector scalar product between vectors is indicated as the second restriction implies that the jacobian of eq 1 must satisfy the following condition 4 j det φ 0 the magnitude of the final distance can be evaluated as shadden et al 2005 5 δ x t 1 δ x t 1 δ x t 1 φ δ x t 0 φ δ x t 0 δ x t 0 c δ x t 0 ϵ c ϵ where c is the cauchy green tensor defined as c φ t φ where t denotes the transpose it is possible to prove that matrix c is positive definite and symmetric since we analyse 2d velocity fields c has two eigenvectors e 1 and e 2 associated with two eigenvalues 0 λ 1 λ 2 respectively maximum stretching occurs when δ x t 0 is chosen such that it is aligned with the eigenvector associated with the maximum eigenvalue of c i e 6 max δ x t 1 λ 2 δ x t 0 where indicates alignment with the eigenvector associated with the maximum eigenvalue λ 2 of the cauchy green tensor since δ x t 0 ϵ eq 6 can be recast to obtain 7 max δ x t 1 e σ t 0 t 1 t ϵ where 8 σ t 0 t 1 1 t log λ 2 represents the maximum finite time lyapunov exponent ftle calculated on a finite integration time t the eigenvectors of c define directions of initial separations for which neighbouring particles are converging or diverging since we are interested in the most active regions of the fluid flow from a kinematic point of view we define the ftle in eq 8 as a function of the maximum eigenvalue panel a of fig 1 shows the deformation in the neighboured of a point under the action of the flow map computation of ftle can be carried out in forward time i e from t 0 to t 0 t or in backward time i e from t 0 t to t 0 identification and classification of the main features of these scalar fields is the subject of the next paragraphs eckmann and ruelle 1985 showed how λ 2 tends asymptotically to a single value λ as time tends to infinity for ergodic systems the following results are strictly applicable to autonomous systems osseledec theorem 9 λ lim t log λ 2 2 t tang and boozer 1996 showed that at times t 1 λ the averaged ftle takes the form 10 λ a t b t λ where a and b are constants analogously the standard deviation behaves as 11 σ λ 1 t the probability density function must behave in agreement with the previous theoretical results i e as the integration time increases the pdf must narrow converging to a delta function abraham and bowen 2002 showed the consistency of these last theoretical results in an analysis carried out on the basis of surface velocity fields of a region of the east australian current lapeyre 2002 found narrowing pdfs as t increases due to the decrease of the standard deviation and a shift of the peaks towards smaller values due to the decaying turbulent field in time he analysed 2 1 detection and classification of the ftle features ridges and trenches lagrangian coherent structures have been broadly recognised as the main features that characterise transport in fluid flows ftle scalar fields have been largely adopted in order to seek for heuristic lagrangian coherent structures in particular ridges have been associated with the concept of stable and unstable manifolds ridges calculated in forward time are considered as a signature of repelling structures whereas ridges calculated in backward time as attracting structures shadden et al 2005 however such a representation is undermined by some known issues haller and yuan 2000 in particular ridges of ftle fields can mark heuristic sls this applies to the present case the transition region between the main channel and the floodplains is marked by such features as discussed in the following jc can be detected at the center of the main channel they mark absence of shear and inhibit cross channel transport such shearless barriers were found to strongly separate the fluid environment preventing exchange between the regions divided by them rypina et al 2007 samelson 1992 such structures were classified as invariant tori like lcs that are often present in geophysical flows beron vera et al 2010 since infinite time lyapunov exponents of invariant tori are zero and invariant tori computed in forward time coincide with invariant tori computed in backward time the heuristic identification of jc relies on trenches of ftle fields that coincide in forward and backward time evaluation of the most influential structures in ftle fields i e ridges and trenches is pursued considering the dynamical properties of these features green et al 2007 mathur et al 2007 ridges behave as attractors of trajectories solution of the dynamical system 12 d x d s σ t 0 t 0 t x where s is the arclength along the gradient lines of σ t 0 t 0 t x and the right hand side represents the spatial gradient of ftle scalar fields this property is at the base of the extraction algorithm proposed by mathur et al 2007 and here adopted the reliability of such a procedure was strengthen by peikert et al 2013 panel b of fig 1 shows the behaviour of ridges as attractors of trajectories solution of eq 12 the detection of trenches is analogue the computations are carried out considering d x d s σ t 0 t 0 t x since the methodology is the same in the following we refer only to ridges once the ridges are detected a hermite interpolation is adopted rovenski 2010 in order to locate first attempt ridges made of points equally spaced between them the advantage of hermite cubic interpolation is twofold tangent vectors of the points that form the curve can be chosen and monotony property of the function curve that is interpolated is generally preserved given points p 1 and p 2 and nonzero tangent vectors q 1 and q 2 the cubic hermite curve r s is defined as 13 r s 1 3 s 2 2 s 3 p 1 s 2 3 2 s p 2 s s 1 2 q 1 s 2 s 1 q 2 where 0 s 1 however the precision of the computed ridges is insufficient to allow for an accurate advection of these structures therefore the procedure described by allshouse and peacock 2015b is applied in order to refine the ridges following the cited approach points belonging to a ridge are detected with a relative precision of order 10 7 and their advection can be reliably computed the refinement process is schematically depicted in fig 2 and can be summarized as follows an initial ridge depicted in red in fig 2 i e the curve interpolated with the hermite polynomial is better approximated placing a number of test points at incremental distances δ at either sides of the ridge along the normal direction ftle values for all these points normal to the initial ridge are then evaluated and the point with the maximum ftle value is taken as the refined position of the ridge green points in fig 2 in case of trenches the revised position is chosen as the corresponding minimum ftle value this process is carried out recursively until a prescribed accuracy is reached once the final refined ridge is calculated it is possible to define a tangential unit vector τ0 to the ridge at time t 0 and a normal unit vector n0 evaluated with frenet serret formulas by applying the flow map gradient we can evaluate the advected tangential vector φτ0 and the advected normal vector φn0 in order to characterize the behaviour of ridges it is possible to evaluate the quantities described by allshouse and peacock 2015b the magnitudes of the advected normal and tangential vectors nl and el show stretching and contraction that occur to particles initially aligned along the ridge and initially perpendicular to the ridge respectively and can be written as 14 n l log φ n 0 15 e l log φ τ 0 similarly it is possible to compute the hyperbolic repulsion ρl and the lagrangian shear σl in order to characterize how the unit normal vector n0 deforms as 16 ρ l log n t φ n 0 17 σ l log τ t φ n 0 where nt and τt are unit normal and tangential vectors to the advected ridge fig 3 shows a pictorial representation of such quantities eqs 14 17 adopt a logarithmic scaling in order emphasize stretching a precise detection of the ridges is mandatory for a reliable computation of the quantities expressed by eqs 14 17 in particular when the flow map gradient is applied to τ0 trenches of ftle fields are characterized adopting the same measures the predominant shear character of ridges is confirmed if σl is greater than ρl along the majority of their length on the contrary jc must present very small σl and vanishing ρl along the majority of their length 2 2 shear lagrangian coherent structures recent developments in the field of lagrangian structures cleared that not all ftle ridges are material lines haller and beron vera 2012 developed a consistent theory in order do detect material lines that act as transport barriers of particular interest are material lines that attract or repel nearby fluid over a finite time interval the normal repulsion rate introduced in the previous section evaluates such a condition logarithmic scaling is not essential in the definition necessary and sufficient criteria for the existence of repelling and attracting lcs over a finite time interval are described in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the cauchy green tensor adopting a variational argument haller and beron vera 2012 showed that a curve is a hyperbolic transport barrier whether it is a trajectory of the autonomous differential equation 18 r e 1 such trajectories are defined strainlines after haller and beron vera 2012 considering a generic point p the least stretching geodesic at p under the cauchy green tensor is the geodesic starting from p with a unit tangent vector expressed by eq 18 in the framework of this work the predominant features of the flow are characterised by shear the material lines shear lcs that maximize lagrangian shear σ τ t φ n 0 are curves everywhere tangent to the shear vector field η hadjighasem et al 2013 haller and beron vera 2012 defined as 19 η λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 e 1 λ 1 λ 1 λ 2 e 2 open curves tangent to the shear vector field of eq 19 are shear lcs i e a shear transport barrier is a trajectory of the autonomous differential equation 20 r η such trajectories are defined shearlines after haller and beron vera 2012 positive lagrangian shear signals clockwise deformation while negative lagrangian shear signals counterclockwise deformation in the local coordinate frame e 1 e 2 the most prominent shear lcs are shearlines that minimize the geodesic shear deviation hadjighasem et al 2013 haller and beron vera 2012 along their length the pointwise closeness of shear lcs to least stretching geodesics can be computed in terms of invariants of the cauchy green tensor the geodesic deviation evaluates the difference of tangents plus the difference of curvatures of a shear lcs from the least stretching geodesic of the cauchy green tensor haller and beron vera 2012 provide an explicit formula in order to evaluate the geodesic deviation which reads 21 d g η 1 λ 2 λ 2 1 λ 2 λ 2 e 1 2 λ 2 1 λ 2 λ 2 e 2 1 λ 2 3 λ 2 5 2 λ 2 3 1 λ 2 3 κ 1 λ 2 5 1 λ 2 2 1 λ 2 λ 2 2 1 λ 2 κ 2 1 λ 2 with e 2 denoting the eigenvector associated with λ 2 κ 1 the curvature of the strainline and κ 2 the curvature of e 2 vector field the predominant shear lcs is chosen as the shearline whose average geodesic deviation 22 avg d g η d g η r d s r d s is the least among all computations of ftle fields and shear lcs are carried out following onu et al 2015 and farazmand and haller 2012 a matlab toolbox was made publicly available by these authors and it has been here exploited 3 experimental flow field the present analysis is based on the experimental measurements of the free surface eulerian velocity fields described in stocchino and brocchini 2010 and stocchino et al 2011 herein we briefly recall the main characteristics of the apparatus and of the measuring system the flume was 20 m long 60 cm wide and the trapezoidal cross section was composed by a central main channel w m c 20 cm two lateral flat floodplains w f p 18 cm and a transition region w t r 2 5 cm fig 4 shows the cross section of the flume velocity measurements have been performed by means of a two dimensional particle image velocimetry system on a field of view of 1 2 0 6 m2 the acquisition rate was between 100 hz and 250 hz depending on the flow velocity each acquisition was made of a number of frames between 2000 and 4000 several series of experiments have been carried out spanning a quite large range of values of the main physical parameters in table 1 we summarize the experimental conditions providing the values of the ratio between the main channel water depth hmc and that of the floodplains hfp r h h m c h f p and the froude number f r u m g r where r is the hydraulic radius g is gravity and um is the peak velocity in the main channel moreover s represents the longitudinal bed slope we keep the same distribution of the flow regimes depending on rh introduced in nezu et al 1999 and used in stocchino et al 2011 as pointed out by nezu et al 1999 three different flow regimes can be identified depending on the value of rh for rh 3 the flow is defined as shallow in this case intense velocity gradients occur at the transition between the main channel and the floodplains leading to a strong shearing and a generation of vorticity associated with the flow depth jump soldini et al 2004 for values of rh 2 the flow is defined as deep characterized by a weaker shear in the transition region the flow depth jump in this case is unable to greatly influence the free surface flow finally intermediate flows are defined when 2 rh 3 in the framework of their analysis stocchino et al 2011 evaluated single and multiple particles statistics since a constant mean velocity causes the absolute dispersion to increase quadratically in time and thus the diffusivity to increase linearly in time their analysis was carried out removing a constant mean from the velocity field in the case of compound channel flows a mean motion does exist in the stream wise direction and it is non homogeneous over the cross section the mean stream wise velocity assumes a bell like distribution as shown in stocchino and brocchini 2010 and its shape depends strongly on the flow depth ratio rh as a result for a 2d flow evolving in the plane the residual velocity reads as 23 u x y t u x y t u x y where u x y indicates the velocity averaged over the duration of the single realization this method is adequate to handle flows that are inhomogeneous like in the present case or in oceanographic applications while the classical results of taylor were obtained assuming u x y 0 i e for homogeneous flows the analysis is then carried out upon such velocity field in agreement with stocchino et al 2011 sls and jc have been computed on the entire dataset however for the sake of clarity we will discuss in details one run of each class showing the recurrent features of every corresponding class 3 1 assessment of two dimensionality in the framework of the present work the fluid flow is considered two dimensional indeed the measurements presented in stocchino and brocchini 2010 and stocchino et al 2011 were taken on the free surface assuming that the flow is mainly two dimensional this experimental approach based on the free surface velocity measurement is often used in many experimental works with primary focus on quasi 2d vortical structures see jirka 2001 nikora et al 2007 socolofksy and jirka 2004 among others this approach is valid as long as the secondary flows can be considered negligible in the formation of the quasi 2d vortical structures with vertical axis of rotation and confined in a layer close to the bottom however in order to verify this hypothesis the lagrangian divergence is here evaluated in particular mathur et al 2007 define lagrangian divergence as 24 l x t 0 t 1 v φ t 0 t ξ d t where v u in the present case the lagrangian divergence is computed along particle paths and should be zero for purely 2d flows it represents the factor by which infinitesimal areas are magnified fig 5 shows a typical snapshot of l x for a shallow flow case the lagrangian divergence presents a quite flat distribution with the only exception of few peaks located at the transition region the overall values are well below unity and much smaller than the ones found by mathur et al 2007 in a rotating water tank where the flow is considered manly two dimensional this measure is also employed by wilson et al 2013 in a turbulent boundary layer in order to quantify its two dimensionality they found a mean value of exp l close to 1 2 over their entire domain arguing that stretching along one direction is balanced by convergence in another direction further considerations led them to accept the flow as two dimensional besides divergence free flows have ftle fields non negative arnold 1992 lipinski and mohseni 2010 therefore an indirect proof of the low three dimensionality of the flow can be obtained inspecting ftle fields as showed in the following sections negative ftle values are very few therefore the assumption of two dimensionality can be fully accepted 4 results four experimental cases are reported in detail as prototypical examples of the respective flow conditions shallow flows intermediate flows and deep flows in the case of intermediate flows two regimes have been further investigated namely flow in subcritical and supercritical conditions the integration time is set to one second in order to let particle stay inside the computational domain furthermore such an integration time has the same order of magnitude of the lagrangian decorrelation time evaluated by stocchino et al 2011 on the same dataset it is worthy to recall the theoretical analysis reported in haller and beron vera 2012 where the authors studied a parallel shear flow as a benchmark case in particular the velocity field of the shear flow investigated takes the form 25 x u y t 26 y v y on a planar domain with non vanishing and non linear time averaged shear a y t 0 t u y τ d τ 0 and da y dy 0 one of the main conclusions of the work by haller and beron vera 2012 was that in such a framework any horizontal line is a shear lcs despite several important differences it is possible to cast an analogy between the above flow and the compound channel flows here discussed indeed although both velocity components are time dependent in the case of compound channels the shear pattern heuristically conforms to the parallel shear flow described by eqs 25 and 26 since shear lcs do develop in the stream wise direction and are advected in the same direction in particular the expected pattern must be symmetric with respect to the axis of the channel because the residual velocity eq 23 upon which eq 2 is solved determines a flow direction of the main channel reversed with respect to the floodplains fig 6 shows a pictorial representation of shear lcs marking positive and negative shear which can be detected in compound channels at the transition between the main channel and the floodplains indeed the bottom region of the figure shows positive shear whereas the top region negative shear defined in agreement with the convention adopted for eq 20 a shearless structure is present along the axis of the main channel marking a jc the main channel is characterized by low values of ftle fields and trenches can be detected this is the typical configuration resulting from a bell shaped velocity profile in the following we present the main results obtained starting from a general description of the behaviour of the ftle fields and then go forward with a detailed description of the lagrangian structures depending on the flow regime 4 1 general behaviour of ftle fields coherent patterns are firstly detected through ftle fields and they are found to behave in agreement with eqs 10 and 11 by choosing 12 different initial conditions and evaluating ftle fields with integration times varying from 0 1 to 5 7 s we can obtain the results plotted in fig 7 this figure shows two bundles of 12 curves representing the average and the standard deviation of the values of ftle fields as a function of the integration time note that the different curves are so closed to each other that can be hardly identified separately the trends of both quantities average and standard deviation are in agreement with the expected theoretical results for ergodic systems showing a monotonic decay in time as predicted by abraham and bowen 2002 moreover the probability density function pdf of the ftle are expected to behave accordingly in particular as the integration time increases the pdf tends to a dirac delta centered at the limit ftle value see fig 8 owing to the two dimensionality of the flow at hand it is reasonable to expect that ftle values are mainly positive leading to positively skewed pdfs 4 2 shear and shearless structures in shallow conditions experiment 201 is considered as a prototypical case of shallow conditions since it was carried out with a ratio r h 4 16 note that the flow for this case is in subcritical regime f r 0 60 fig 9 shows typical lagrangian patterns of shallow flow conditions panel a and b depict a snapshot of the forward and backward ftle fields evaluated at t 5 0 s respectively both forward and backward fields show structures at the transition from the main channel to the lateral floodplains upon each field three main structures depicted in black are identified and their ridges isolated at the center of the main channel trenches are identified and depicted in red in order to prove the predominant shear character of ridges the magnitude of the advected unit normal and tangential vectors are computed taking advantage of eqs 14 and 15 besides repulsion and lagrangian shear are evaluated applying eqs 16 and 17 figs 10 and 11 show such quantities as a function of the curvilinear coordinated s along forward and backward ridges respectively in all cases the growth of the normal vectors is greater than the growth of the tangential vectors i e nl is greater then el the growth of the normal vector n0 is predominantly due to lagrangian shear since σl is greater than ρl along each ridge for almost their entire length ridge c belonging to the forward field of fig 9 panel a shows some noisy signal in the hyperbolic repulsion depicted in fig 10 this behaviour is all but surprising since it is encountered even from dataset resulting from numerical simulations allshouse and peacock 2015b these quantitative results suggest that material elements initially aligned along ftle ridges will tend to move consistently without significant elongations on the contrary material elements initially perpendicular to the ridges will stretch because of shear trenches of ftle fields are identified at the center of the main channel where low ftle values appear these trenches behave as jc showing absence of shear panel a of fig 12 shows that nl and el are almost zero along the entire length of both jc evaluated from forward and backward fields this means that along jc unit normal and tangential vectors are not significantly deformed panel b show that ρl is almost zero whereas σl is very small this reflects the fact that unit normal vectors do not deform and their projection along the tangential direction to the ridge is negligible ftle ridges are nicely in agreement with shearlines fig 13 shows positive shear vector field in the lower part of the domain in blue and negative shear vector field in the upper part of the domain in red shear vector fields and shearlines are computed through eqs 19 and 20 respectively the corresponding positive and negative shearlines are superimposed on the corresponding areas this particular pattern is due to the symmetry of the problem clockwise shear in the lower part of the domain is reflected in counterclockwise shear in the upper part of the domain see for comparison fig 6 fig 14 shows the predominant shear lcs in black that minimize the geodesic deviation forward ridges of fig 9 are plotted in green and backward ridges in blue they are not perfectly aligned with shear lcs since the eigenvectors associated with maximum eigenvalues differ from the shear vector field however their alignment is remarkable jc are depicted in red and are located at the center of the main channel they do not perfectly superimpose increasing the integration time should lead to a better superposition however this leads to an accumulation of particles to the boundaries resulting in a splintering of the ridges as a result the integration time is kept to one second 4 3 shear and shearless structures in intermediate conditions subcritical case experiment 207 was carried out with a ratio r h 2 26 and it belongs to intermediate and subcritical conditions f r 0 73 it is analyzed as a reference configuration for this type of flows ftle fields show in general a pattern comparable to shallow conditions even if high ftle regions protrude towards lateral channels fig 15 shows the ftle field and represents the general configuration of interest for forward and backward fields seven predominant ridges are identified in forward time and two in backward time their behaviour is characterized with the same procedure followed in the previous section analogously to the shallow case lagrangian shear is predominant to repulsion as depicted in figs 16 and 17 classifying these ridges as sls compared to the shallow case higher values of ftle are obtained in the floodplains such values could reach peaks comparable to those of the transition region see panel a of fig 15 at the center of the main channel trenches of ftle fields are identified fig 18 quantifies shear properties of such trenches and qualifies them as jc showing results analogue to those of experiment 201 however the extension of the region where low ftle values are present contracts fig 19 shows positive shear vector field in the lower part of the domain in blue and negative shear vector field in the upper part of the domain in red with a pattern analogous to the previous case fig 20 shows the shear lcs that minimize the geodesic deviation alongside ridges and trenches shear lcs do align along longitudinal ftle ridges jc identified in both forward and backward fields superimpose much better than in the case of experiment 201 4 4 shear and shearless structures in intermediate conditions supercritical case experiment 105 was carried out with a ratio r h 2 15 belonging to intermediate and supercritical conditions f r 1 05 ftle fields show in general a pattern comparable to intermediate and subcritical conditions fig 21 shows the ftle field representing the general configuration of interest for forward and backward fields four predominant ridges are identified in forward time and two in backward time higher ftle values are located at the transition region however some ridges do not completely align along the stream wise direction in particular ridges c of panel a and b of panel b of fig 21 tend to align diagonally with respect to the stream wise direction as a result for these specific ridges lagrangian shear is not always predominant over hyperbolic repulsion figs 22 and 23 show that the magnitude of the advected normal is always greater than the magnitude of the advected tangential vector for all the ridges such predominance is due to lagrangian shear except for the ridges with diagonal alignment therefore we do not classify these ridges as sls since they show for a non negligible length a hyperbolic behaviour very well defined trenches are detected at the center of the main channel fig 24 shows the shear properties of these trenches that qualify as jc with negligible shear fig 25 shows positive shear vector field in the lower part of the domain in blue and negative shear vector field in the upper part of the domain in red with a pattern analogous to the previous case fig 26 shows the shear lcs that minimize the geodesic deviation these shear lcs align with ridges of ftle fields except for ridges c of panel a and b of panel b of fig 21 this explains why hyperbolic repulsion is predominant over lagrangian shear along some portions of these ridges on the contrary jc are very well superimposed 4 5 shear and shearless structures in deep conditions experiment 213 was carried out with a ratio r h 1 68 and in subcritical conditions f r 0 82 it is analysed as a reference configuration for deep flow conditions ftle fields show in general a pattern with the absence of persistent structures fig 27 shows the ftle field representing the general configuration of interest for forward and backward fields in deep conditions the ftle field is less readable and regions with high ftle values protrude towards the inner of the main channel four predominant ridges are identified in forward time and two in backward time their behaviour is characterized with the same procedure followed in the previous sections analogously to the previous cases lagrangian shear is predominant to repulsion as depicted in fig 28 for ridges that are mainly longitudinal i e a and c of the forward field panel a of fig 27 transverse ridges b and d show on the contrary comparable lagrangian shear and repulsion strength and consequently cannot be classified as a sls such a behaviour showed in fig 29 characterizes even ridge b belonging to the backward field panel b of fig 27 trenches are located at the center of the main channel however the width of the low ftle region has shrunk significantly compared to the previous cases as a result trenches tend to be interrupted by higher values of ftle fig 30 quantifies the shear properties of these trenches that can be consequently classified as jc fig 31 shows positive shear vector field in the lower part of the domain in blue and negative shear vector field in the upper part of the domain in red with a pattern analogous to the previous case fig 32 shows the shear lcs that minimize the geodesic deviation these shear lcs do align along longitudinal ftle ridges jc do superimpose as expected as a general comment of such a flow condition it is possible to argue a strong independence of the surface flow from the depth jump indeed transition region from the main channel to the floodplains is not clearly marked by high ftle regions as in the previous cases furthermore the presence of jc is not continuous along the stream wise direction 5 discussion and concluding remarks this work aims to detect shear and shearless lagrangian coherent structures in compound channels finite time lyapunov exponent fields are calculated on the basis of eulerian velocity fields measured via piv stocchino et al 2011 stocchino and brocchini 2010 and they unveil the most active regions of the fluid flow from a kinematic point of view from a methodological perspective ridges and trenches of ftle fields are obtained combining the best methods found in literature algorithm proposed by mathur et al 2007 hermite interpolation by haller 2011 recovered in a simplified version from rovenski 2010 owing to a predominant linearity of ridges and trenches along the stream wise direction refinement process proposed by allshouse and peacock 2015b note that the eulerian velocity fields were collected during an experimental campaign whereas most applications concern analytical or numerical models this reinforce the idea that this lagrangian measure is a robust tool that can be applied to realistic and complex flow fields the main parameters controlling the flow under investigation are the depth ratio rh i e the ratio between the depth of the main channel and the depth of the floodplains and the froude number the first parameter defines the shallowness of the flow whereas the second the critical conditions the results suggest a strong influence of the depth ratio on the establishment of persistent lagrangian patterns whereas the froude number do not seem to be an important controlling parameter however our dataset does not present supercritical flows for the shallow conditions and the highest froude number is 1 07 for the intermediate conditions therefore the relevance of our results mainly concerns the influence of the depth ratio in shallow flow conditions ftle fields show active regions at the transition from the main channel to the lateral floodplains marked by high ftle values regions of small ftle values at the center of the main channel are also present the former are associated with ridges whereas the latter with trenches ridges mark shear lagrangian structures that maximize lagrangian shear and trenches shearless lagrangian structures that behave as jet cores such a configuration is kept even in intermediate conditions however it is possible to observe that ftle ridges protrude more in the floodplains the analysis performed on the resulting ridges in order to assess whether hyperbolic repulsion or lagrangian shear are predominant suggests that ridges aligned along the stream wise direction show predominance of lagrangian shear over hyperbolic repulsion on the contrary ridges that are aligned diagonally with respect to the stream wise direction show portions of their length where hyperbolic repulsion is predominant over lagrangian shear the clear separation between the main channel and the floodplains shades by decreasing the flow depth ratio and reaching deep flow conditions as a result the presence of shear and shearless lagrangian structures detected from ftle fields is less readable it is still possible to recover some features but their persistence is less evident the peculiar pattern of shallow and intermediate conditions strongly influences transport as fig 33 exemplifies green dots represent tracers advected by the flow panels a c e and g represent initial conditions of particles superimposed on forward ftle fields panels b d f and h represent final conditions resulting from the advection process superimposed on corresponding forward ftle fields note that forward ftle fields are usually associated with repelling structures however a negligible hyperbolic repulsion was detected for ridges aligned along the stream wise direction in the previous paragraphs panels a f refer to shallow and intermediate conditions these clearly show the shear character of ridges at the transition region due to the fact that the initial distance between particles is not kept constant by the advection process by decreasing rh the shear character persists but with less strength jet cores at the centre of the main channel preserve the initial spacing between the particles panels g and h refer to deep conditions and they show that the shear strength tends to be lost this analysis gives an integrated point of view over a finite time interval of the previous work carried out by stocchino and brocchini 2010 and stocchino et al 2011 the influence of the eulerian macrovortices that develop mainly in shallow conditions cf fig 4 of stocchino et al 2011 can be directly observed in the meandering pattern that particles show in such a flow see panel b of fig 33 however eulerian and lagrangian diagnostics are conceptually different haller 2015 since the former refer to an instantaneous time instance whereas the latter to a finite time interval therefore a direct matching is impossible to reach ridges of ftle fields marking heuristic sls conform to rigorous sls calculated adopting the geodesic theory of transport barriers haller and beron vera 2012 such sls are aligned along the stream wise direction with a symmetric pattern positive sls are located in the bottom part of the domain and negative sls are located in the upper part of the domain however sls are always aligned along the stream wise direction decreasing rh down to a value typical of deep flow conditions sls conform to shallow and intermediate conditions however the results should be considered jointly with the fact that ftle fields are less significant and do not show strong persistent patterns this fact reflects the different velocity profiles that are recovered in the different depth flow conditions along a cross section fig 2 of stocchino and brocchini 2010 shows that peak velocities in the main channel and in the floodplains are comparable at deep flow conditions therefore ftle fields prove to be once again a valuable tool in order to assess the behaviour of a fluid flow giving an immediate understanding of the strength of the mixing pattern and the most active regions of the domain however these active areas need to be well characterized by the evaluation of the lagrangian shear and the hyperbolic repulsion to further understand the dynamics sls are detected in order to depict the shear pattern the joint analysis of ftle fields and sls manage to unveil the mixing pattern thoroughly since the shortcomings of one measure are balanced by strengths of the other besides the presence of jc at the center of the main channel impacts on tracer advection these results are of evident importance in riverine and estuarine analysis since these structures mark regions where particles undergo different fates for example evaluation of concentration distributions employed in the advection diffusion equation must carefully take into account the inhomogeneity resulting from sls and jc as a result turbulent diffusivity can vary on the spatial domain besio et al 2012 especially across regions delimited by sls and jc natural streams or estuaries usually show several regions that adapt to the framework of this work the presence of analogue structures is quite likely therefore lcs should mark the natural boundaries along which diffusivities could dramatically change their magnitude further research is needed to clearly connect the eulerian properties of the flow with its intrinsic lagrangian features indeed the compound channel geometry leads to the generation of eulerian vortical structures the appearance of which is strongly dependent on the flow depth ratio the present results suggest that a similar relationship is found when lagrangian coherent structures are studied a link between the two frameworks based on the spectral properties of eulerian velocity fields and ftle fields would then be desirable supplementary material supplementary material associated

863,geological heterogeneity of the subsurface caused by both discrete features and spatially distributed hydraulic conductivity fields affects the flow of coastal groundwater it influences the shape and the position of the interface between saltwater and freshwater as well as the location and flux rate of freshwater discharge to the ocean fringing reefs lead to a bimodal regime of freshwater discharge with discharge at the beach face and through deeper submarine springs impermeable vertical flow barriers dykes lead to an impoundment of fresh groundwater and a compartmentalization of the aquifer but also to a delayed expulsion of saline water spatially distributed conductivity fields affect the shape of the interface and the geometry of the saltwater wedge higher effective conductivities lead to a further landward intrusion of the wedge toe these flow characteristics can be important for groundwater extraction the delineation of protection zones and the assessment of

zones is strongly influenced by the presence of natural geological heterogeneities abarca 2006 permeable and impermeable discrete features such as fractures and karst conduits but also dykes can channel submarine groundwater discharge e g taborosi et al 2013 sebben et al 2015 vittecoq et al 2015 fluvial tidal and deltaic sediments show distinct spatial lithological variations of material and

2015 in order to bridge this gap we study the influence of various typical geological heterogeneities on steady state freshwater flow in coastal settings at a physical model scale sandtank experiments allow visualizing the conceptual features and quantifying their relative influence this can be very useful for providing conceptual understanding of such systems and thus improve numerical models for real life cases and also to explain field observations three features common in nature were considered 1 coastal caprocks fringing reefs 2 impermeable vertical structures dykes and 3 variable hydraulic conductivities at regular spacing for each case variations of recharge rate or sea level respectively were considered the rationale is to identify the main hydrological features caused by heterogeneity through the physical model and if necessary assess their influence numerically the hawaiian islands are a type example for islands where the hydrogeology is strongly influenced by the presence of both dykes and fringing reefs peterson 1972 druecker and fan 1976 macdonald et al 1990 scholl et al 1996 but similar conditions prevail on many other pacific islands sedimentary heterogeneity is also to be expected in many coastal environments especially deltaic ones michael et al 2016 1 2 fringing reefs the main aquifer of islands can be capped at the coast by fluvial or marine deposits macdonald et al 1990 oki et al 1998 bratton 2007 the latter often occurring in the form of a fringing reef they form around the shoreline of oceanic islands often of volcanic origin by predominantly biogenic accumulation of carbonates it was charles darwin 1842 who discovered their temporal evolution from a fringing reef to a ring shaped atoll this process is influenced by a complex interplay of erosion and subsidence of the volcano growth of the reef body by carbonate accumulation and the evolution of the sea level over time toomey et al 2013 fringing reefs are important for oceanic islands for a variety of reasons they provide a habitat for marine life and are thus economically important for fishery and tourism they act as breakwaters protecting the coastline from wave

influenced by a variety of processes including cementation dolomitization dissolution and boring by animals resulting in non homogeneous flow patterns land et al 1989 perry 1999 befus et al 2014 compared to basaltic rocks they are however often less permeable in cases with a high contrast between the hydraulic conductivity of the cap rock and the weathered volcanic rock the former can act as confining layer sometimes leading to artesian conditions e g in pearl harbor hawaii peterson 1972 the presence and hydraulic conductivity of fringing reefs can strongly influence the location and intensity of freshwater discharge which may deliver nutrients but also pollutants to the oceans e g gallagher et al 1996 bratton 2007 moore 2010 knee and paytan 2012 wang et al 2014 moosdorf et al 2015 nutrient input can strongly influence the ecology of the reef and adjacent lagoons e g by promoting algal blooms which subdue coral growth and lead to reef degradation naim 1993 lapointe 1997 dadhich et al 2017 it is therefore imperative to know the location and flux rate of freshwater discharge at a reef 1 3 dykes dykes are more or less vertical sheeted intrusions which commonly occur during the later stages of the volcanic cycle and intrude into extensional faults and fractures weathered dykes can act as preferential flow paths when surrounded by less permeable host rock here we will focus on impermeable dykes surrounded by a more permeable host rock such dykes or dyke swarms can play a major role in subsurface flow processes due to their low permeability spatial extent and

model experiments to simulate a two dimensional cross section of a coastal aquifer with i a fringing reef ii a vertical dyke and iii structured aquifer heterogeneity on different scales the general set up of the laboratory experiments is adopted from stoeckl and houben 2012 however instead of islands coastal aquifers were modeled here represented by a single coastline in the physical model the sand tank of 2 m length 0 5 m height and 5 cm width was filled with sand to a length of 1 18 m from the right hand side in all cases it reached a height of 27 cm above base for case i fringing reef and of 35 cm for the ii vertical dyke and iii aquifer heterogeneity fig 1 tap water and artificial saltwater were used for the representation of fresh groundwater and the ocean water respectively densities of the waters were determined using a density meter dma 38 by anton paar austria density of freshwater was determined to be 997 4 kg m 3 and that of saline water 1021 2 kg m 3 at 23 c prior to injection the saltwater was degassed by a water jet vacuum pump to prevent air entrapment by outgassing on the left hand side an overflow bucket was placed at the open saltwater surface to maintain a constant sea water level in all experiments drippers were installed above the sand aquifer to recharge freshwater from the top supplied by a multi channel peristaltic pump ismatec bvp wertheim germany to visualize processes of mixing and flow paths through the sandy aquifer the tracer dyes uranine yellow eosine red and indigotine blue were added to the freshwater at a concentration of 0 3 g

dyke experiment an impermeable vertical barrier was erected in the center of the sand aquifer using purple playdoh plasticine which is practically impermeable this feature was 26 cm in height 2 cm in thickness and placed at a distance of 163 cm from the coast compare fig 1 ii the dyke did not reach the surface because in nature dykes tend to be truncated by weathering erosion or sedimentary cover kuntz et al 2002 scholl et al 1996 the aquifer was made of medium sand with k 4 10 10 3 m s n 0 45 initially the whole aquifer was occupied by saline water this assumption is based on the development of the volcanic islands discussed here they grow from the ocean floor towards the sea surface and as long as they have not breached the sea level the pore spaces are completely filled with seawater the same four freshwater recharge rates of q 1 21 m d 2 69 m d 3 70 m d and 4 90 m d were applied as in the experiments with the fringing reef the development of the freshwater body was monitored until quasi steady state was achieved i e until no more movement was noticeable visually 2 4 physical model of structured aquifer heterogeneity the influence of small scale aquifer heterogeneity on the fresh saltwater interface position and shape was investigated using three different sands and three compartment lengths instead of a stochastic conductivity distribution we used a structured arrangement of internally homogeneous rectangular sand bodies three different filter sands were used with hydraulic conductivities for the fine medium and coarse sand being 2 3 10 3 m s 5 1 10 3 m s and 1 9 10 2 m s respectively and porosities between 0 47 and 0 41 compartments of 9 cm 18 cm and 27 cm length were prepared to investigate the influence of different correlation length scales respectively the length increment between the three compartment lengths is constant at 9 cm this causes a doubling going from 9 cm to 18 cm but the increase from 18 cm to 27 cm is only a third the height of the compartments was kept constant at 3 5 cm for all cases the aspect ratio height over length was thus 0 39 0 19 and 0 13 for the three cases it should be noted that the aspect ratios of our physical model compartments are much higher than those commonly found for most natural sediment layers fig 1 iii shows the alternating distribution of medium coarse and fine sand here for a compartment length of 18 cm four different ocean levels 21 0 cm 24 5 cm 28 0 cm and 30 5 cm above base with a constant increment of 3 5 cm equaling the compartment height were studied for each compartment length the recharge rate was kept constant at 1 73 m d for each compartment length an additional experiment with a constant sea level of 0 315 m and an approximately doubled recharge rate of 3 36 m d was performed 2 5 numerical model simulations on the basis of the physical experiments numerical model simulations were performed using the variable density and solute transport software feflow diersch 2014 the aim was to a validate the physical observations and b extend the experimental findings where measurements were not possible e g the calculation of flow rates of individual cells two dimensional cross sectional models were developed corresponding to the different scenarios i fringing reef ii vertical dyke and iii three different length scales of aquifer heterogeneity the basic conceptual model underlying all different numerical models is shown in fig 2 slight adaptations were implemented to modify the base case accordingly which are described in the respective sections below all concentrations are normalized to 0 c 1 where c 0 is freshwater with a salt concentration of 0 g l 1 and a density of 997 kg m 3 and c 1 is saltwater with a concentration of 35 g l 1 and a density of 1021 kg m 3 the initial condition for the simulation is a fully saltwater saturated domain with a concentration of c 1 for simulating unsaturated flow the van genuchten empirical model was used van genuchten 1980 the van genuchten parameters for all compartments were manually set to α 4 1 m 1 and n 1 964 above sea level the sand in the physical experiment was almost saturated due to capillary effects with the exception of some larger pores at the very top where air was observed the boundary conditions bc are shown in fig 2 and are defined as follows the horizontal top boundary is a constant flow neumann bc and constant concentration dirichlet bc of c 0 to ensure freshwater recharge into the model the slope at the left side of the model represents the ocean which is simulated by a constant head bc dirichlet for flow together with a directionally dependent concentration bc dirichlet for transport of c 1 where freshwater can leave the system the vertical right boundary center of the island and the horizontal bottom boundary are assigned no flow neumann bcs the models were calibrated manually by adjusting the hydraulic conductivities with the objective of fitting the width of the outflow zone and the position of the freshwater saltwater interface to the physical experiments in the numerical model of the dyke the latter was implemented as a no flow bc the saltwater head bc was assigned a height of 28 cm on the ocean side of the model and the fluid flux bc was assigned from the top right corner of the model boundary to a distance of 50 cm along the horizontal plane the longitudinal and transversal dispersivities were set to αl 0 01 m and αt 0 001 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 fringing reef the presence of the fringing reef leads to a redistribution of groundwater flow at the discharge zone despite being comprised of rather permeable fine sand the fringing reef is significantly less permeable than the main aquifer therefore freshwater discharging from the main aquifer mainly passes underneath the reef and discharges into the ocean further offshore as a result submarine springs are likely to develop at the rim of the reef in the physical model the localized outflow was visible by the color but could not be determined quantitatively the steady state lens geometries of the four different recharge rates studied are visualized in fig 3 a to d it shows a growing freshwater lens thickness 13 5 cm to 22 0 cm as well as the small increase of the freshwater outflow face below the fringing reef flow budgets at selected nodes were extracted from the numerical model for each freshwater recharge rate tab 1 fig 4 a b node 1 is the uppermost discharge where the seawater level and thus the beach seepage face is located discharge decreases continuously along the outflow face in the reef but reaches a secondary maximum at node 21 this node reflects the transition point between the fringing reef lower permeability and the underlying aquifer material higher permeability in nature this would correspond to a submarine spring most discharge occurs in a small zone around this node the fit between the numerical model and the experimental data is generally good fig 4c not unexpectedly higher freshwater recharge rates lead to higher total discharge rates however with increasing recharge a redistribution occurs between discharge through and below the reef except for the recharge rate of 1 21 m d where reef flow dominates total discharge through and below the reef are roughly similar if only the flow through the beach face node 1 and the strongest sgd spring node 21 are compared the latter produces almost twice as much freshwater except for the lowest recharge rate of 1 21 m d the outflow is somewhat larger than the net recharge due to an entrainment of saline water it is important to notice that the model predicts two main discharge locations into the ocean one at the top of the fringing reef beach face and one at its bottom submarine springs in actual coastal environments these outlets correspond to freshwater springs one at the beach or at least near the shore and the other one offshore and submarine there is some field evidence for a bimodal and uneven freshwater discharge around fringing reefs on the caribbean coast of the karstic yucatan peninsula mexico null et al 2014 found freshwater discharge both as beach seepage and submarine springs with the latter having flow rates up to two orders of magnitude higher than the former it should be noted that in nature the submarine springs are not entirely composed of freshwater but may carry a significant proportion of recycled seawater in the puerto morelos lagoon yucatan parra et al 2015 found that beach face seepage accounts for 21 5 and submarine springs for 78 5 of discharge on guam mylroie et al 2001 found freshwater seepage at a beach fronted by a fringing reef but failed to find springs maybe because they were further off shore in pantai krakas lombok indonesia moosdorf and oehler 2017 encountered freshwater influenced springs in a coastal reef at depths of 7 5 m below sea level it should be noted that such bimodal discharge distributions are not an exclusive feature of fringing reefs michael et al 2016 also found similar patterns for heterogeneous conductivity fields in coastal zones 3 2 vertical dyke in both the physical and the numerical model figs 5 and 6 the thickness of the freshwater lens upstream of the dyke landward side is thinner compared to the downstream seaward side of the dyke seawater initially present upstream is washed out only slowly by dispersive entrainment and diffusion along the interface and is therefore conserved for longer periods of time it should be noted that the pictures in figs 5 and 6 show a quasi steady state situation both the physical and the numerical model had not reached a full steady state due to time constraints in nature the outwash of the landward saline water may become completed only on a geological time scale the thickness of the lens on the seaward side increases linearly with recharge rate figs 5 and 6c on the landward side the freshwater thickness increases linearly for the first three recharge rates but then slightly levels off which indicates that steady state conditions were indeed not yet reached both physical and numerical models show a widening of the interface between the top of the dyke and the foot of the seaward part of the freshwater lens figs 5 and 6a this brackish zone is an effect of the constant entrainment of saltwater stored upstream which is pushed over the dyke top by freshwater recharge from the landward side this entrainment also explains the thicker transition zone on the landward side the highest flow velocities occur above the dyke top 14 m d and at the outflow zone 24 m d at the beach fig 6b the fit between the numerical model and the experimental data is generally good fig 6b our findings have some implications for the exploration of freshwater lenses on island of the hawaiian type the fresh water body on the landward side of a dike might be significantly thinner than on the seaward side at least for geologically young environments where the outwash of the landward saline water has not come to completion a horizontal drilling through such a dike might therefore result in encountering saline water comte et al 2017 predicted thicker freshwater lenses on the landward side of dykes this is probably explained by the fact that they studied a system where the seaward side is under constant saltwater influence induced by tides and overwash according to our physical and numerical models the mixing zone close to the seaward side of a dyke can be thicker than on the other side due to entrainment of saline groundwater trapped on the other side i e behind the dyke this can potentially result in the occurrence of an extensive zone of brackish water to our knowledge no field evidence of this has yet been published 3 3 structured aquifer heterogeneity the numerical models for the three structured heterogeneity fields reflect the physical models quite well fig 7 in some cases however the tip of the wedge was not represented well this is an influence of small perturbations in the physical model which lead to a jump of the toe into the next compartment by extracting the freshwater gradient from the numerical model the average hydraulic conductivity of the system was obtained using the law of darcy for the three compartment lengths of 9 18 and 27 cm the average conductivities were obtained as 4 21 10 3 4 61 10 3 and 4 75 10 3 m s these values fit well into the conductivity range of the individual sands and are close to the value for the medium sand 5 1 10 3 m s the values thus show a dependency between the compartment length and the system transmissivity however the relative increase of the compartment lengths is 1 2 3 base 9 cm compartment and that of the resulting conductivity only 1 00 1 09 1 13 the different compartment lengths show several effects on the shape of freshwater saltwater interface at steady state and the propagation of the saltwater wedge in the freshwater section a transition to a higher conductive compartment always leads to a more pronounced horizontal flow component than in adjacent less conductive compartments in the unsaturated zone however water flow predominantly took place in the fine and medium sand compartments figs 8 and 9 due to the higher capillary forces with heterogeneities the interface shape changes from the typical smooth curve of a homogeneous aquifer to a stepped curve when water enters a more permeable compartment bending into a more horizontal flow regime could be observed while with small compartment lengths the interface is steeper and shows more but less elongate steps figs 7 9 this confirms findings by abarca 2006 based on numerical models with small compartment lengths the deviations from the homogeneous case are relatively small sebben et al 2015 came to similar conclusions numerous but small heterogeneities lead to an interface geometry resembling the homogeneous case for each of the 15 experiments the position of the saltwater wedge toe was extracted from the images at steady state figs 7 8 9 in some cases the saltwater reached the right hand boundary and the maximum toe lengths had to be extrapolated these values are rather uncertain especially for the longer compartment lengths where the intersection with the base is difficult to predict due to the elongated steps in the interface not surprisingly the saltwater wedge reaches further inland and increases in size with increasing sea level this applies consistently for all three compartment lengths in a practically linear fashion figs 8 10 a more interesting however is the response of the saltwater wedge to the increase in compartment length figs 8 10b with increasing compartment length the saltwater wedge increases in size and protrudes further inland however the increase is most noticeable for the jump from the 9 cm to the 18 cm compartment length going from 18 to 27 cm hardly brings any further increase there is an apparent deviation between scenarios fig 8f and j which show similar wedge shapes the wedge in fig 8f however has a very thin toe such fine features are sensitive to small changes in the physical model and thus difficult to reproduce the dependence of the saltwater wedge geometry on the compartment length is a result of the effective hydraulic conductivity of the system kerrou and renard 2010 with longer compartments flow is focused to the more permeable compartments and becomes more horizontal figs 8 and 9 longer compartments thus result in a higher system transmissivity this in turn leads to lower freshwater heads which in due cause reduce the freshwater thickness and make the saltwater wedge move further inland following the ghijben herzberg principle however there is a limit on the effect of the compartment length as the similarity between the toe lengths of the 18 and 27 cm compartments show figs 8 and 10b as shown above the increase in hydraulic conductivity between these two compartments lengths is rather small the observed behavior can be explained qualitatively by a comparison to the analytical model by cheng and ouazar 1999 based on strack 1976 which allows calculating the wedge toe length for an unconfined homogeneous coastal aquifer the model assumes that there is no outflow zone point outflow 1 x t q 0 q l q 0 q l 2 k δ 1 δ z 0 2 q where xt is the wedge toe length l measured starting from the beach face q the recharge rate l t q0 the horizontal background flow rate from the right l t k the aquifer hydraulic conductivity l t z0 the sea level above datum l l the distance between the coast and the right hand boundary l and δ the density ratio ρs ρf ρf here δ 0 025 with ρs and ρf being the densities of saline and fresh water respectively the right hand boundary here is impermeable and thus q0 0 the comparably weak increase of hydraulic conductivity with increasing compartment length is reflected in figs 9b and 10 where the wedge toe length does increase only slightly with compartment length in our case the compartment length is a measure of the total or effective hydraulic conductivity the dependency between sea level and wedge toe length is on the other hand practically linear which is also qualitatively suggested by eq 1 this effect is also reflected in fig 9a despite their heterogeneous set up the physical experiments in principle confirm the predictions by eq 1 the influence of the recharge rate was studied for two recharge rates q 1 37 m d q 3 36 m d at a constant sea level of 0 315 m for all three compartment lengths fig 11 as predicted by eq 1 the influence of the recharge rate is also limited accordingly the toe does not penetrate twice as far for the lower recharge rate fig 11 it has to be noted though that recharge rates in nature will not vary over orders of magnitude for a given hydrological system the comparison of wedge toe lengths observed in the physical models and of those calculated from eq 1 show only a moderate to weak correlation fig 12 while the general trends are similar individual values can deviate quite strongly this is due to the simplifications of the analytical model which assumes homogeneous conditions and does not consider an outflow zone in the sandtank experiments the compartments especially the longer ones lead to pronounced jumps of the interface and the outflow zone also affects the geometry of the wedge the physical models presented here are for obvious reasons limited in both number and observational accuracy numerical models could fill these gaps but the dimensionality of heterogeneous flow fields needs to be considered in three dimensional systems the interconnectedness of the flow paths and thus the effective hydraulic conductivity is different from two dimensional systems kerrou and renard 2010 when encountering a low permeability compartment in a 2d system the flow path cannot deviate sideways to a more permeable unit as it would be the case in 3d or in nature fogg 1986 in two dimensional set ups abarca 2006 and michael et al 2016 found that heterogeneity promotes a seaward displacement of the saltwater wedge based on three dimensional numerical models kerrou and renard 2010 found the opposite a landward migration with an increasing degree of heterogeneity pool et al 2015a arrived at a similar conclusion based on a three dimensional numerical model they also found that an increase in correlation length perpendicular to the coast as in our cases promotes the development of preferential flow paths our physical models are despite being physically three dimensional technically two dimensional as no variation of hydraulic conductivity occurs parallel to the coast in the y direction insofar the models presented here contradict the seaward displacement of saltwater predicted by abarca 2006 and michael et al 2016 for 2d systems there are however noteworthy differences between the previously published numerical models and our set up which might explain this contradiction both abarca 2006 and michael et al 2016 found that increasing heterogeneity causes a widening of the mixing zone this could not be recreated in our models because the interface in the physical model remains sharp throughout the experiment figs 8 9 there is undoubtedly a scale effect between our physical experiments and the large scale numerical models which prevents a direct comparison our sharp interface also meant that the bimodal fresh and brackish water discharge predicted by michael et al 2016 could not be observed in our models 4 conclusions the geological heterogeneity in coastal aquifers influences the flow of groundwater and thereby the interface geometry as well as the location and distribution of freshwater discharge in this study the influence of both discrete and spatially distributed geological features was investigated by physical experiments and numerical modeling in the case of a fringing reef fresh groundwater preferentially discharges in two locations 1 at the beach face close to the sea water level and 2 at the bottom of the reef the latter as sgd potentially at significant distances from the coast our models confirm field data that show sgd being stronger than beach seepage in regions of water scarcity water from such offshore sgd might be tapped as already practiced in several locations worldwide mijatovic 2007 moosdorf and oehler 2017 the location and flux rate of freshwater discharge are important factors for the ecology of reefs and lagoons as land borne nutrient inputs can severely interfere with coral growth vertical dykes on volcanic islands e g of the hawaiian type act as flow barriers leading to compartmentalization and strong local gradients on the landward side of the dyke initially present saltwater may become entrapped for extended periods of time the depth to the interface might thus differ significantly on both sides of the dyke on the seaward side of the dyke dispersive entrainment of saltwater from the landward side of the dyke can lead to a local widening of the mixing zone rendering water in this zone potentially unsuitable for use structured variations of the hydraulic conductivity field lead to a stepped interface longer compartment lengths lead to stronger deflections of the interface into the horizontal direction and thus stronger deviations from the geometry of a homogeneous aquifer our models show a landward displacement of saltwater with increasing transmissivity or compartment length here due to a decrease of freshwater heads however the effect is limited since there is no linear relationship between compartment length and hydraulic conductivity higher sea levels on the other hand lead to a proportional increase of the wedge toe length our findings confirm at least qualitatively the predictions of the analytical model by strack 1976 and cheng and ouazar 1999 for a homogeneous aquifer and of field scale numerical models kerrou and renard 2010 pool et al 2015a they also underline the importance of model dimensionality in studies of heterogeneous aquifers although our models are necessarily simplifications of natural heterogeneity they can be useful for developing conceptual models for actual coastal aquifers e g islands of the hawaiian type or deltaic coasts this can be important for

863,geological heterogeneity of the subsurface caused by both discrete features and spatially distributed hydraulic conductivity fields affects the flow of coastal groundwater it influences the shape and the position of the interface between saltwater and freshwater as well as the location and flux rate of freshwater discharge to the ocean fringing reefs lead to a bimodal regime of freshwater discharge with discharge at the beach face and through deeper submarine springs impermeable vertical flow barriers dykes lead to an impoundment of fresh groundwater and a compartmentalization of the aquifer but also to a delayed expulsion of saline water spatially distributed conductivity fields affect the shape of the interface and the geometry of the saltwater wedge higher effective

zones is strongly influenced by the presence of natural geological heterogeneities abarca 2006 permeable and impermeable discrete features such as fractures and karst conduits but also dykes can channel submarine groundwater discharge e g taborosi et al 2013 sebben et al 2015 vittecoq et al 2015 fluvial tidal and deltaic sediments show distinct spatial lithological variations of material and

2015 in order to bridge this gap we study the influence of various typical geological heterogeneities on steady state freshwater flow in coastal settings at a physical model scale sandtank experiments allow visualizing the conceptual features and quantifying their relative influence this can be very useful for providing conceptual understanding of such systems and thus improve numerical models for real life cases and also to explain field observations three features common in nature were considered 1 coastal caprocks fringing reefs 2 impermeable vertical structures dykes and 3 variable hydraulic conductivities at regular spacing for each case variations of recharge rate or sea level respectively were considered the rationale is to identify the main hydrological features caused by heterogeneity through the physical model and if necessary assess their influence numerically the hawaiian islands are a type example for islands where the hydrogeology is strongly influenced by the presence of both dykes and fringing reefs peterson 1972 druecker and fan 1976 macdonald et al 1990 scholl et al 1996 but similar conditions prevail on many other pacific islands sedimentary heterogeneity is also to be expected in many coastal environments especially deltaic ones michael et al 2016 1 2 fringing reefs the main aquifer of islands can be capped at the coast by fluvial or marine deposits macdonald et al 1990 oki et al 1998 bratton 2007 the latter often occurring in the form of a fringing reef they form around the shoreline of oceanic islands often of volcanic origin by predominantly biogenic accumulation of carbonates it was charles darwin 1842 who discovered their temporal evolution from a fringing reef to a ring shaped atoll this process is influenced by a complex interplay of erosion and subsidence of the volcano growth of the reef body by carbonate accumulation and the evolution of the sea level over time toomey et al 2013 fringing reefs are important for oceanic islands for a variety of reasons they provide a habitat for marine life and are thus economically important for fishery and tourism they act as breakwaters protecting the coastline from wave action compared to atolls which have received a lot of attention e g ayers and vacher 1986 oberdorfer et al 1990 underwood et al 1992 bailey et al 2009 white and falkland 2010 befus et al 2014 werner

parra et al 2015 the only physical model did not consider natural freshwater discharge but rather a perforation of the caprock by a well lau 1967 the hydraulic conductivity of fringing reefs is influenced by a variety of processes including cementation dolomitization dissolution and boring by animals resulting in non homogeneous flow patterns land et al 1989 perry 1999 befus et al 2014 compared to basaltic rocks they are however often less permeable in cases with a high contrast between the hydraulic conductivity of the cap rock and the weathered volcanic rock the former can act as confining layer sometimes leading to artesian conditions e g in pearl harbor hawaii peterson 1972 the presence and hydraulic conductivity of fringing reefs can strongly influence the location and intensity of freshwater discharge which may deliver nutrients but also pollutants to the oceans e g gallagher et al 1996 bratton 2007 moore 2010 knee and paytan 2012 wang et al 2014 moosdorf et al 2015 nutrient input can strongly influence the ecology of the reef and adjacent lagoons e g by promoting algal blooms which subdue coral growth and lead to reef degradation naim 1993 lapointe 1997 dadhich et al 2017 it is therefore imperative to know the location and flux rate of freshwater discharge at a reef 1 3 dykes dykes are more or less vertical sheeted intrusions which commonly occur during the later stages of the volcanic cycle and intrude into extensional faults and fractures weathered dykes can act as preferential flow paths when surrounded by less permeable host rock here we will focus on impermeable dykes surrounded by a more permeable host rock such dykes or dyke swarms can play a major role in subsurface flow processes due to their low permeability spatial extent and

model experiments to simulate a two dimensional cross section of a coastal aquifer with i a fringing reef ii a vertical dyke and iii structured aquifer heterogeneity on different scales the general set up of the laboratory experiments is adopted from stoeckl and houben 2012 however instead of islands coastal aquifers were modeled here represented by a single coastline in the physical model the sand tank of 2 m length 0 5 m height and 5 cm width was filled with sand to a length of 1 18 m from the right hand side in all cases it reached a height of 27 cm above base for case i fringing reef and of 35 cm for the ii vertical dyke and iii aquifer heterogeneity fig 1 tap water and artificial saltwater were used for the representation of fresh groundwater and the ocean water respectively densities of the waters were determined using a density meter dma 38 by anton paar austria density of freshwater was determined to be 997 4 kg m 3 and that of saline water 1021 2 kg m 3 at 23 c prior to injection the saltwater was degassed by a water jet vacuum pump to prevent air entrapment by outgassing on the left hand side an overflow bucket was placed at the open saltwater surface to maintain a constant sea water level in all experiments drippers were installed above the sand aquifer to recharge freshwater from the top supplied by a multi channel peristaltic pump ismatec bvp wertheim germany to visualize processes of mixing and flow paths through the sandy aquifer the tracer dyes uranine yellow eosine red and indigotine blue were added to the freshwater at a concentration of 0 3 g

47 was placed at the upper left corner of the aquifer where the freshwater outflow zone into the ocean is located this fine sand feature had a height of 10 cm and a length of 12 cm fig 1 the saltwater level was adjusted to 5 cm below the top of the sandy aquifer to a height of 22 cm four different freshwater recharge rates were applied to the top of the model i e 1 21 m d 2 69 m d 3 70 m d and 4 90 m d since only 0 48 m of the model length received recharge fig 1 the net recharge rate is equal to 50 of the preceding numbers effects of internal heterogeneity of the fringing reef e g stratification karstification and tidally induced saltwater overwash were not considered the former was investigated numerically by oki et al 1998 2 3 physical model of vertical dyke for the vertical dyke experiment an impermeable vertical barrier was erected in the center of the sand aquifer using purple playdoh plasticine which is practically impermeable this feature was 26 cm in height 2 cm in thickness and placed at a distance of 163 cm from the coast compare fig 1 ii the dyke did not reach the surface because in nature dykes tend to be truncated by weathering erosion or sedimentary cover kuntz et al 2002 scholl et al 1996 the aquifer was made of medium sand with k 4 10 10 3 m s n 0 45 initially the whole aquifer was occupied by saline water this assumption is based on the development of the volcanic islands discussed here they grow from the ocean floor towards the sea surface and as long as they have not breached the sea level the pore spaces are completely filled with seawater the same four freshwater recharge rates of q 1 21 m d 2 69 m d 3 70 m d and 4 90 m d were applied as in the experiments with the fringing reef the development of the freshwater body was monitored until quasi steady state was achieved i e until no more movement was noticeable visually 2 4 physical model of structured aquifer heterogeneity the influence of small scale aquifer heterogeneity on the fresh saltwater interface position and shape was investigated using three different sands and three compartment lengths instead of a stochastic conductivity distribution we used a structured arrangement of internally homogeneous rectangular sand bodies three different filter sands were used with hydraulic conductivities for the fine medium and coarse sand being 2 3 10 3 m s 5 1 10 3 m s and 1 9 10 2 m s respectively and porosities between 0 47 and 0 41 compartments of 9 cm 18 cm and 27 cm length were prepared to investigate the influence of different correlation length scales respectively the length increment between the three compartment lengths is constant at 9 cm this causes a doubling going from 9 cm to 18 cm but the increase from 18 cm to 27 cm is only a third the height of the compartments was kept constant at 3 5 cm for all cases the aspect ratio height over length was thus 0 39 0 19 and 0 13 for the three cases it should be noted that the aspect ratios of our physical model compartments are much higher than those commonly found for most natural sediment layers fig 1 iii shows the alternating distribution of medium coarse and fine sand here for a compartment length of 18 cm four different ocean levels 21 0 cm 24 5 cm 28 0 cm and 30 5 cm above base with a constant increment of 3 5 cm equaling the compartment height were studied for each compartment length the recharge rate was kept constant at 1 73 m d for each compartment length an additional experiment with a constant sea level of 0 315 m and an approximately doubled recharge rate of 3 36 m d was performed 2 5 numerical model simulations on the basis of the physical experiments numerical model simulations were performed using the variable density and solute transport software feflow diersch 2014 the aim was to a validate the physical observations and b extend the experimental findings where measurements were not possible e g the calculation of flow rates of individual cells two dimensional cross sectional models were developed corresponding to the different scenarios i fringing reef ii vertical dyke and iii three different length scales of aquifer heterogeneity the basic conceptual model underlying all different numerical models is shown in fig 2 slight adaptations were implemented to modify the base case accordingly which are described in the respective sections below all concentrations are normalized to 0 c 1 where c 0 is freshwater with a salt concentration of 0 g l 1 and a density of 997 kg m 3 and c 1 is saltwater with a concentration of 35 g l 1 and a density of 1021 kg m 3 the initial condition for the simulation is a fully saltwater saturated domain with a concentration of c 1 for simulating unsaturated flow the van genuchten empirical model was used van genuchten 1980 the van genuchten parameters for all compartments were manually set to α 4 1 m 1 and n 1 964 above sea level the sand in the physical experiment was almost saturated due to capillary effects with the exception of some larger pores at the very top where air was observed the boundary conditions bc are shown in fig 2 and are defined as follows the horizontal top boundary is a constant flow neumann bc and constant concentration dirichlet bc of c 0 to ensure freshwater recharge into the model the slope at the left side of the model represents the ocean which is simulated by a constant head bc dirichlet for flow together with a directionally dependent concentration bc dirichlet for transport of c 1 where freshwater can leave the system the vertical right boundary center of the island and the horizontal bottom boundary are assigned no flow neumann bcs the models were calibrated manually by adjusting the hydraulic conductivities with the objective of fitting the width of the outflow zone and the position of the freshwater saltwater interface to the physical experiments in the numerical model of the dyke the latter was implemented as a no flow bc the saltwater head bc was assigned a height of 28 cm on the ocean side of the model and the fluid flux bc was assigned from the top right corner of the model boundary to a distance of 50 cm along the horizontal plane the longitudinal and transversal dispersivities were set to αl 0 01 m and αt 0 001 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 fringing reef the presence of the fringing reef leads to a redistribution of groundwater flow at the discharge zone despite being comprised of rather permeable fine sand the fringing reef is significantly less permeable than the main aquifer therefore freshwater discharging from the main aquifer mainly passes underneath the reef and discharges into the ocean further offshore as a result submarine springs are likely to develop at the rim of the reef in the physical model the localized outflow was visible by the color but could not be determined quantitatively the steady state lens geometries of the four different recharge rates studied are visualized in fig 3 a to d it shows a growing freshwater lens thickness 13 5 cm to 22 0 cm as well as the small increase of the freshwater outflow face below the fringing reef flow budgets at selected nodes were extracted from the numerical model for each freshwater recharge rate tab 1 fig 4 a b node 1 is the uppermost discharge where the seawater level and thus the beach seepage face is located discharge decreases continuously along the outflow face in the reef but reaches a secondary maximum at node 21 this node reflects the transition point between the fringing reef lower permeability and the underlying aquifer material higher permeability in nature this would correspond to a submarine spring most discharge occurs in a small zone around this node the fit between the numerical model and the experimental data is generally good fig 4c not unexpectedly higher freshwater recharge rates lead to higher total discharge rates however with increasing recharge a redistribution occurs between discharge through and below the reef except for the recharge rate of 1 21 m d where reef flow dominates total discharge through and below the reef are roughly similar if only the flow through the beach face node 1 and the strongest sgd spring node 21 are compared the latter produces almost twice as much freshwater except for the lowest recharge rate of 1 21 m d the outflow is somewhat larger than the net recharge due to an entrainment of saline water it is important to notice that the model predicts two main discharge locations into the ocean one at the top of the fringing reef beach face and one at its bottom submarine springs in actual coastal environments these outlets correspond to freshwater springs one at the beach or at least near the shore and the other one offshore and submarine there is some field evidence for a bimodal and uneven freshwater discharge around fringing reefs on the caribbean coast of the karstic yucatan peninsula mexico null et al 2014 found freshwater discharge both as beach seepage and submarine springs with the latter having flow rates up to two orders of magnitude higher than the former it should be noted that in nature the submarine springs are not entirely composed of freshwater but may carry a significant proportion of recycled seawater in the puerto morelos lagoon yucatan parra et al 2015 found that beach face seepage accounts for 21 5 and submarine springs for 78 5 of discharge on guam mylroie et al 2001 found freshwater seepage at a beach fronted by a fringing reef but failed to find springs maybe because they were further off shore in pantai krakas lombok indonesia moosdorf and oehler 2017 encountered freshwater influenced springs in a coastal reef at depths of 7 5 m below sea level it should be noted that such bimodal discharge distributions are not an exclusive feature of fringing reefs michael et al 2016 also found similar patterns for heterogeneous conductivity fields in coastal zones 3 2 vertical dyke in both the physical and the numerical model figs 5 and 6 the thickness of the freshwater lens upstream of the dyke landward side is thinner compared to the downstream seaward side of the dyke seawater initially present upstream is washed out only slowly by dispersive entrainment and diffusion along the interface and is therefore conserved for longer periods of time it should be noted that the pictures in figs 5 and 6 show a quasi steady state situation both the physical and the numerical model had not reached a full steady state due to time constraints in nature the outwash of the landward saline water may become completed only on a geological time scale the thickness of the lens on the seaward side increases linearly with recharge rate figs 5 and 6c on the landward side the freshwater thickness increases linearly for the first three recharge rates but then slightly levels off which indicates that steady state conditions were indeed not yet reached both physical and numerical models show a widening of the interface between the top of the dyke and the foot of the seaward part of the freshwater lens figs 5 and 6a this brackish zone is an effect of the constant entrainment of saltwater stored upstream which is pushed over the dyke top by freshwater recharge from the landward side this entrainment also explains the thicker transition zone on the landward side the highest flow velocities occur above the dyke top 14 m d and at the outflow zone 24 m d at the beach fig 6b the fit between the numerical model and the experimental data is generally good fig 6b our findings have some implications for the exploration of freshwater lenses on island of the hawaiian type the fresh water body on the landward side of a dike might be significantly thinner than on the seaward side at least for geologically young environments where the outwash of the landward saline water has not come to completion a horizontal drilling through such a dike might therefore result in encountering saline water comte et al 2017 predicted thicker freshwater lenses on the landward side of dykes this is probably explained by the fact that they studied a system where the seaward side is under constant saltwater influence induced by tides and overwash according to our physical and numerical models the mixing zone close to the seaward side of a dyke can be thicker than on the other side due to entrainment of saline groundwater trapped on the other side i e behind the dyke this can potentially result in the occurrence of an extensive zone of brackish water to our knowledge no field evidence of this has yet been published 3 3 structured aquifer heterogeneity the numerical models for the three structured heterogeneity fields reflect the physical models quite well fig 7 in some cases however the tip of the wedge was not represented well this is an influence of small perturbations in the physical model which lead to a jump of the toe into the next compartment by extracting the freshwater gradient from the numerical model the average hydraulic conductivity of the system was obtained using the law of darcy for the three compartment lengths of 9 18 and 27 cm the average conductivities were obtained as 4 21 10 3 4 61 10 3 and 4 75 10 3 m s these values fit well into the conductivity range of the individual sands and are close to the value for the medium sand 5 1 10 3 m s the values thus show a dependency between the compartment length and the system transmissivity however the relative increase of the compartment lengths is 1 2 3 base 9 cm compartment and that of the resulting conductivity only 1 00 1 09 1 13 the different compartment lengths show several effects on the shape of freshwater saltwater interface at steady state and the propagation of the saltwater wedge in the freshwater section a transition to a higher conductive compartment always leads to a more pronounced horizontal flow component than in adjacent less conductive compartments in the unsaturated zone however water flow predominantly took place in the fine and medium sand compartments figs 8 and 9 due to the higher capillary forces with heterogeneities the interface shape changes from the typical smooth curve of a homogeneous aquifer to a stepped curve when water enters a more permeable compartment bending into a more horizontal flow regime could be observed while with small compartment lengths the interface is steeper and shows more but less elongate steps figs 7 9 this confirms findings by abarca 2006 based on numerical models with small compartment lengths the deviations from the homogeneous case are relatively small sebben et al 2015 came to similar conclusions numerous but small heterogeneities lead to an interface geometry resembling the homogeneous case for each of the 15 experiments the position of the saltwater wedge toe was extracted from the images at steady state figs 7 8 9 in some cases the saltwater reached the right hand boundary and the maximum toe lengths had to be extrapolated these values are rather uncertain especially for the longer compartment lengths where the intersection with the base is difficult to predict due to the elongated steps in the interface not surprisingly the saltwater wedge reaches further inland and increases in size with increasing sea level this applies consistently for all three compartment lengths in a practically linear fashion figs 8 10 a more interesting however is the response of the saltwater wedge to the increase in compartment length figs 8 10b with increasing compartment length the saltwater wedge increases in size and protrudes further inland however the increase is most noticeable for the jump from the 9 cm to the 18 cm compartment length going from 18 to 27 cm hardly brings any further increase there is an apparent deviation between scenarios fig 8f and j which show similar wedge shapes the wedge in fig 8f however has a very thin toe such fine features are sensitive to small changes in the physical model and thus difficult to reproduce the dependence of the saltwater wedge geometry on the compartment length is a result of the effective hydraulic conductivity of the system kerrou and renard 2010 with longer compartments flow is focused to the more permeable compartments and becomes more horizontal figs 8 and 9 longer compartments thus result in a higher system transmissivity this in turn leads to lower freshwater heads which in due cause reduce the freshwater thickness and make the saltwater wedge move further inland following the ghijben herzberg principle however there is a limit on the effect of the compartment length as the similarity between the toe lengths of the 18 and 27 cm compartments show figs 8 and 10b as shown above the increase in hydraulic conductivity between these two compartments lengths is rather small the observed behavior can be explained qualitatively by a comparison to the analytical model by cheng and ouazar 1999 based on strack 1976 which allows calculating the wedge toe length for an unconfined homogeneous coastal aquifer the model assumes that there is no outflow zone point outflow 1 x t q 0 q l q 0 q l 2 k δ 1 δ z 0 2 q where xt is the wedge toe length l measured starting from the beach face q the recharge rate l t q0 the horizontal background flow rate from the right l t k the aquifer hydraulic conductivity l t z0 the sea level above datum l l the distance between the coast and the right hand boundary l and δ the density ratio ρs ρf ρf here δ 0 025 with ρs and ρf being the densities of saline and fresh water respectively the right hand boundary here is impermeable and thus q0 0 the comparably weak increase of hydraulic conductivity with increasing compartment length is reflected in figs 9b and 10 where the wedge toe length does increase only slightly with compartment length in our case the compartment length is a measure of the total or effective hydraulic conductivity the dependency between sea level and wedge toe length is on the other hand practically linear which is also qualitatively suggested by eq 1 this effect is also reflected in fig 9a despite their heterogeneous set up the physical experiments in principle confirm the predictions by eq 1 the influence of the recharge rate was studied for two recharge rates q 1 37 m d q 3 36 m d at a constant sea level of 0 315 m for all three compartment lengths fig 11 as predicted by eq 1 the influence of the recharge rate is also limited accordingly the toe does not penetrate twice as far for the lower recharge rate fig 11 it has to be noted though that recharge rates in nature will not vary over orders of magnitude for a given hydrological system the comparison of wedge toe lengths observed in the physical models and of those calculated from eq 1 show only a moderate to weak correlation fig 12 while the general trends are similar individual values can deviate quite strongly this is due to the simplifications of the analytical model which assumes homogeneous conditions and does not consider an outflow zone in the sandtank experiments the compartments especially the longer ones lead to pronounced jumps of the interface and the outflow zone also affects the geometry of the wedge the physical models presented here are for obvious reasons limited in both number and observational accuracy numerical models could fill these gaps but the dimensionality of heterogeneous flow fields needs to be considered in three dimensional systems the interconnectedness of the flow paths and thus the effective hydraulic conductivity is different from two dimensional systems kerrou and renard 2010 when encountering a low permeability compartment in a 2d system the flow path cannot deviate sideways to a more permeable unit as it would be the case in 3d or in nature fogg 1986 in two dimensional set ups abarca 2006 and michael et al 2016 found that heterogeneity promotes a seaward displacement of the saltwater wedge based on three dimensional numerical models kerrou and renard 2010 found the opposite a landward migration with an increasing degree of heterogeneity pool et al 2015a arrived at a similar conclusion based on a three dimensional numerical model they also found that an increase in correlation length perpendicular to the coast as in our cases promotes the development of preferential flow paths our physical models are despite being physically three dimensional technically two dimensional as no variation of hydraulic conductivity occurs parallel to the coast in the y direction insofar the models presented here contradict the seaward displacement of saltwater predicted by abarca 2006 and michael et al 2016 for 2d systems there are however noteworthy differences between the previously published numerical models and our set up which might explain this contradiction both abarca 2006 and michael et al 2016 found that increasing heterogeneity causes a widening of the mixing zone this could not be recreated in our models because the interface in the physical model remains sharp throughout the experiment figs 8 9 there is undoubtedly a scale effect between our physical experiments and the large scale numerical models which prevents a direct comparison our sharp interface also meant that the bimodal fresh and brackish water discharge predicted by michael et al 2016 could not be observed in our models 4 conclusions the geological heterogeneity in coastal aquifers influences the flow of groundwater and thereby the interface geometry as well as the location and distribution of freshwater discharge in this study the influence of both discrete and spatially distributed geological features was investigated by physical experiments and numerical modeling in the case of a fringing reef fresh groundwater preferentially discharges in two locations 1 at the beach face close to the sea water level and 2 at the bottom of the reef the latter as sgd potentially at significant distances from the coast our models confirm field data that show sgd being stronger than beach seepage in regions of water scarcity water from such offshore sgd might be tapped as already practiced in several locations worldwide mijatovic 2007 moosdorf and oehler 2017 the location and flux rate of freshwater discharge are important factors for the ecology of reefs and lagoons as land borne nutrient inputs can severely interfere with coral growth vertical dykes on volcanic islands e g of the hawaiian type act as flow barriers leading to compartmentalization and strong local gradients on the landward side of the dyke initially present saltwater may become entrapped for extended periods of time the depth to the interface might thus differ significantly on both sides of the dyke on the seaward side of the dyke dispersive entrainment of saltwater from the landward side of the dyke can lead to a local widening of the mixing zone rendering water in this zone potentially unsuitable for use structured variations of the hydraulic conductivity field lead to a stepped interface longer compartment lengths lead to stronger deflections of the interface into the horizontal direction and thus stronger deviations from the geometry of a homogeneous aquifer our models show a landward displacement of saltwater with increasing transmissivity or compartment length here due to a decrease of freshwater heads however the effect is limited since there is no linear relationship between compartment length and hydraulic conductivity higher sea levels on the other hand lead to a proportional increase of the wedge toe length our findings confirm at least qualitatively the predictions of the analytical model by strack 1976 and cheng and ouazar 1999 for a homogeneous aquifer and of field scale numerical models kerrou and renard 2010 pool et al 2015a they also underline the importance of model dimensionality in studies of heterogeneous aquifers although our models are necessarily simplifications of natural heterogeneity they can be useful for developing conceptual models for actual coastal aquifers e g islands of the hawaiian type or deltaic coasts this can be important for the planning of groundwater extraction the delineation of protection zones and the assessment of contaminant transport to coastal ecosystems acknowledgment the authors would like thank the two

864,the use of acoustic techniques has become common for estimating suspended sediment in water environments an emitted beam propagates into water producing backscatter and attenuation which depend on scattering particles concentration and size distribution unfortunately the actual particles size distribution psd may largely affect the accuracy of concentration quantification through the unknown coefficients of backscattering strength ks 2 and normalized attenuation ζs this issue was partially solved by applying the multi frequency approach despite this possibility a relevant scientific and practical question remains regarding the possibility of using acoustic methods to investigate poorly sorted sediment in the spectrum ranging from clay to fine sand the aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of combining the measurement of sound attenuation and backscatter to determine ζs for the suspended particles and the corresponding concentration the proposed method is moderately dependent from actual psd thus relaxing the need of frequent calibrations to account for changes in ks 2 and ζs coefficients laboratory tests were conducted under controlled conditions to validate this measurement technique with respect to existing approaches the developed method more accurately estimates the concentration of suspended particles ranging from clay to fine sand and at the same time gives an indication on their actual psd keywords backscatter acoustic attenuation suspended sediment particle size distribution 1 introduction reliable data regarding suspended sediment in water environment serves a variety of environmental and engineering practices these include inland navigation guerrero et al 2013a paarlberg et al 2015 sea shoreline protection archetti and romagnoli 2011 carniel et al 2011 erosion hazard mitigation during flood elhakeem et al 2017 irrigation water supply guerrero 2014 habitat and river morphology preservation nones and gerstgraser 2016 haimann et al 2016 guerrero et al 2015 and environmental sustainable hydropower development guerrero et al 2016 felix et al 2016 the direct sampling of the mixture of water and sediment is a challenging task especially during rough climate conditions such as storms and waves in the sea and high discharges and rough water level conditions in a river in addition the continuous monitoring of suspended sediment in a fixed position is hardly achievable by means of physical samples because of the time and effort required for sampling and subsequent laboratory analyses hence indirect methods for the quantification of suspended sediment have been noticeably improved in the last decades focusing on acoustic and optical techniques as to the acoustic methods the assumptions made regarding the actual particle size distribution psd of the suspended sediment guerrero et al 2016 eventually enable an accurate inversion of the sonar equation thorne and hurther 2014 therefore the reliability of acoustic methods largely depends on the validity of these assumptions two main approaches exist the backscatter method and the attenuation method for the first the suspended sediment concentration was successfully correlated to the measured backscattering strength i e a logarithmic form of the backscatter that may be corrected by considering attenuation processes due to suspended particles indeed the acoustic backscatter depends in addition on psd guerrero et al 2016 thorne and meral 2008 this occurrence may undermine the mentioned correlation however using a multi frequency approach the indetermination related to the actual psd may be solved guerrero et al 2013b thorne and hanes 2002 thosteson and hanes 1998 to some degree although this may not be feasible when using few frequencies for poorly sorted sediment i e wide psd even so the multi frequency approach was validated for the investigation of suspended sand from riverbed or in the nearshore region the second approach attenuation is based on scatter attenuation that spreads energy out of the incident beam and the viscous dissipation as result of the friction produced by particles to fluid relative motions this approach was developed for a prevailing attenuation effect due to suspended fine fractions i e clay and silt which dominates the acoustic beam propagation into a homogenous concentration in this case the measured attenuation was correlated to sediment concentration the backscatter gradient along the beam being negligible this attenuation method was successfully applied for the monitoring of fine sediment concentration during flood events in rivers wright et al 2010 moore et al 2012 by relaying on the fact that suspended sediment are homogenously distributed along horizontal alignments unfortunately the sound attenuation depends on psd too which again raises questions on the reliability of acoustic methods when using a single frequency in case of changing psd during the monitored period although the ensonified volume may be limited to a region where homogenous concentration is expected eventually resulting in a punctual measurement whatever the method used the obtained correlations between sediment concentration and measured backscatter and attenuation are site and time specific for example the attenuation effect due to clay silt fractions should be calibrated when trying to correlate sand concentration to single and multi frequency backscatter for the attenuation approach the correlation between attenuation and concentration should be validated in the field that accounts for the actual psd these facts may require frequent and dense sampling to keep the assessed calibration validated accounting for psd change and the actual distribution of concentration along the acoustic beam this in turn makes the use of acoustic methods tricky interfering with the objective of substituting the physical sampling with indirect methods therefore despite the recent advancements in acoustic methods for suspended sediment assessment further research efforts in this area are justified by the objective of improving the reliability of these methods for poorly sorted psds lowering at the same time the need of calibration on the basis of frequent and dense samples in this regard this paper reports on the possibility of simultaneously characterizing particles size distribution and concentration by combining attenuation and backscatter measurements a novel acoustic method significantly reducing the estimation sensitivity to actual psd is proposed for the estimation of suspended sediment concentration the method is based on attenuation to backscatter ratio at a single frequency which straightforwardly defines the acoustic parameter correlating the measured attenuation to sediment concentration for a wide range of psds ranging from clay to sand and with changing width i e variable standard deviation in addition the ratio of backscatters at two well spaced frequencies is used to further extend the range of applicability of the method toward wider psds the method exhibits a modest dependence on the actual psd therefore providing two benefits as it i lowers the need of case specific calibrations ii offers a reliable estimation of concentration and an indication regarding the size distribution of suspended sediment in sum a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches is proposed to advance the fundamental understanding of the interaction of suspended sediment with ultrasound in water environment the measure of ultrasound intensity within water is used to indirectly quantify the concentration of suspended sediment an issue which is relevant in a variety of basic processes and applications regarding water resources in particular the method is novel in that the ratio of acoustic attenuation to backscatter is applied for the first time to estimate the sediment concentration for different psds advancements are achieved is a two levels first different psds are simulated and tested in the laboratory exploring a variety of combinations of mean sizes and standard deviations to represent the most likely conditions typical of actual rivers secondly further steps are taken towards the complete validation of an integrated theoretical experimental approach to measure suspended sediment in rivers paving the way for field applications the proposed method will be useful to both practitioners and theoreticians who work in the field of hydroacoustics thus contributing to the advancement of knowledge regarding fluvial processes and related water resources the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 summarizes the background for acoustic methods and describes the proposed methodology for a reliable assessment of concentration using the attenuation to backscatter ratio at a single frequency and the dual frequency backscatter ratio section 3 describes the laboratory setup and tests conducted to validate the method the results obtained are presented and examined in section 4 section 5 presents a general discussion on the proposed method its advancements and limitations focusing on the possibility of extracting information regarding the psd and on the use of multifrequency to further enlarge the method applicability a set of conclusions and perspectives for future work closes the paper section 6 2 the acoustic method in this section the basic aspects regarding the underwater propagation of sound are firstly presented by introducing the sonar equation section 2 1 then the physical meaning of the attenuation to backscatter ratio at given frequency is presented section 2 2 and the effects of psd changes on coefficients of backscattering strength ks 2 and normalized attenuation ζs are described the use of the attenuation to backscatter ratio at 0 5 mhz for the inversion of the sonar equation is illustrated in section 2 3 the method consists of three steps i the determination of the most likely psd affecting the sound propagation ii the quantification of ζs and iii the assessment of corresponding sediment concentration finally an alternative approach to evaluate the sediment concentration in case of low ζs at 0 5 mhz is explored in section 2 4 the method employs a higher frequency i e 8 mhz to infer the ratio between backscattering strength coefficients at 8 mhz and 0 5 mhz 2 1 acoustic scattering and attenuation for readers convenience only the basic aspects are reported here regarding the theory of sound scattering from a water particles mixture exhaustive studies may be found in technical scientific books medwin and clay 1998 urick 1997 urick 1948 and in more recent review papers thorne and hurther 2014 thorne and meral

backscattering strength at a distance r iii the two way round trip attenuation iv the geometrical spreading this relationship is expressed by eq 1 which is derived by e g thorne and hanes 2002 and is usually referred as the sonar equation 1 i p 0 2 r 0 2 k t 2 k s 2 m s r 2 ψ 2 e 4 α w α s r where i the backscattering coefficient ks 2 times the mass concentration ms is the backscattering strength ii α w and α s are the water viscosity and suspended sediment attenuation coefficients respectively iii r2ψ2 is the geometrical spreading that includes the near field correction coefficient ψ downing et al 1995 in the far field ψ 1 it is worth noting that much of the existing acoustics literature reports logarithmic forms of the sonar equation including the target strength or an equivalent decibel expression of the backscattering strength that is ten times the common logarithm of ks 2ms this is because the echo intensity level e spans a wide range of orders of magnitude and an hydrophone usually gives the received sound intensity in a db scale idb guerrero et al 2017 latosinski et al 2014 szupiany et al 2016 as reported in eq 2 2 i d b c 10 l o g k s 2 m s 20 l o g r ψ 20 l o g e 2 α

different relationships exist for the backscattering strength and for the two additive mechanisms producing the attenuation the scatter attenuation that spreads energy out of the incident beam and the viscous dissipation resulting from the friction produced by particles to fluid relative motions thorne and meral 2008 moore et al 2012 hanes 2012 these relationships eventually depend on the applied acoustic frequency and the actual psd yielding the backscattering coefficient as well as the normalized scatter and viscous attenuation coefficients guerrero et al 2016 these normalized coefficients give the normalized attenuation coefficient ζs which multiplies the suspended sediment concentration ms yielding the attenuation term as reported on the left hand side of eq 3 2 2 the attenuation to backscatter ratio at single frequency for an acoustic beam ensonifying a homogeneous concentration of a multi size mixture of sediments the backscattering strength and sediment attenuation coefficients are not range r dependent in this case the idb profile corrected for instrumental constants the beam spreading and the water viscosity attenuation term gives an estimation of the difference between the backscattering strength and the sediment attenuation term at given concentration that is the left hand side of eq 3 this difference recasts into a ratio when passing from the decibel expression as reported in eq 3 to the backscattering strength i e k s 2 m s in particular it is worth noting that the attenuation to backscatter ratio at a given frequency and for homogeneous concentration depends on the actual psd and can be estimated from idb profiling this was first pointed out by guerrero et al 2017 although without an exhaustive presentation of the relations among attenuation to backscatter ratio ζs ks 2 and psd features i e mean size standard deviation skewness these relations are derived and illustrated in the present paper figs 1 a b 2 a and b by assessing ks 2 ζss and ζsv values according to thorne and meral 2008 and for a variety of psds instrumental frequencies ranging from 0 5 to 8 mhz are considered covering well typical adcp frequencies and including the frequencies used in laboratory tests presented herein most importantly the sorting of suspended sediment largely affects the acoustic parameters and therefore the attenuation to backscatter ratio to illustrate this dependency a number of psds are considered table 1 firstly a mono size distributions from 1 to 3000 µm is adopted to represent a theoretically simple condition furthermore the log normal function is used to simulate a variety of distributions corresponding to real sediment suspensions in this case the psd mean diameter d changes from 0 6 to about 100 µm the corresponding standard deviations std are within the range 0 4 24 5 µm while skewness skw is equal to 8 overall the mono size and log normal distributions represent a wide set of conditions from poorly sorted clay i e 0 4 µm 24 5 µm and 8 for d std and skw respectively to well sorted sand i e 100 3000 µm mono sizes which is a decreasing sorting for fining sediment as it is usually observed in riverine environment the attenuation to backscatter ratio is plotted versus psd mean size or standard deviation to illustrate its dependency on the simulated psd for a given frequency of 0 5 mhz fig 1 a and b the attenuation to backscatter ratio decreases for coarsening mean size fig 1 a and for a widening of the corresponding distributions fig 1 b in more detail psds group in lines with different slopes characterized by a given std and d fig 1 a and b respectively for example the attenuation to backscatter ratio noticeably decreases for a coarsening of mono size psd i e for std 0 in fig 1 a on the contrary the same ratio is almost constant for large standard deviations i e for std 24 5 in fig 1 a in addition an increase in the psd width larger std implies a significant decrease of the attenuation to backscatter ratio for fine psds i e d 0 6 in fig 1 b while corresponding to an almost constant ratio for coarse mean sizes i e d 90 in fig 1 b an attenuation to backscatter ratio decreasing with increasing d and std is therefore evident within a certain range of d and std the ratio then flattens for finer and well sorted sediment respectively the dependency of the attenuation to backscatter ratio on the applied frequency can be observed in fig 2 a and b in this case the attenuation to backscatter ratio values were assessed for the same psds i e d std and skw values similar to table 1 and for two well spaced frequencies i e 0 6 and 1 2 mhz the relationships among the attenuation to backscatter ratio and d std values resulted in different lines in fig 2 a and b these lines exhibit an upwards shift for the lower frequency of 0 6 mhz which reflects an increased weight of the attenuation processes over backscattering strength at low frequency 2 3 assessment of suspended sediment concentration the possibility of single frequency acoustic measurement of sand and clay concentrations in uniform suspensions was discussed by hanes 2012 the use of horizontal aligned beams was proved to work for concentration assessment during flood events moore et al 2012 this method relies on the derivative of a simplified version of eq 3 valid for a homogenous content of suspended sediment in this case the change of backscattering strength is negligible along the ranging distance and the suspended sediment concentration easily relates to the measured profile slope didb dr through the attenuation coefficient αs guerrero et al 2017 as shown in eq 4 4 α s m s ζ s s ζ s v α w 1 2 r 1 40 log e d i d b d r eq 4 yields the sediment concentration by measuring the slope of sound intensity corrected for beam spreading 1 2r and the clear water attenuation αw that sum up in the right hand side term the sediment concentration is the right hand side term divided by the normalized attenuation coefficient ζs ζss ζsv this simplified inversion of the sonar equation is possible for a known value of ζs which needs to be previously fixed by site specific and periodic calibrations the method previously proposed herein provides an estimation of ζs to be applied in eq 4 starting from the same eq 3 a trivial finding is that a straight line fit in the form mx n may be used in the idb r quadrant in this case the idb profiling corrected for beam spreading and clear water attenuation i e the right hand side of eq 3 may be modelled with the correct backscattering strength and sediment attenuation on the left hand side of eq 3 which are the intercept n and the slope coefficient m of a quasi linear fitting therefore the tests performed consisted in idb profiling through homogenous concentrations which enabled the concurrent assessment of the backscattering strength and sediment attenuation by simply finding the best fitting of eq 3 this also provided a measurement of the attenuation to backscatter ratio abr ζs ks 2 this acronym indicates the value obtained from echo profiling rather than the assessment based on known psds in fact abr is derived from the ratio of the slope to intercept coefficients where the suspended sediment concentration cancels out eqs 5 7 5 n 10 l o g k s 2 m s b s d b 6 m ζ s s ζ s v m s α s 7 a b r m 10 n 10 ζ s s ζ s v m s 10 10 log k s 2 m s 10 ζ s k s 2 as already mentioned a non trivial relation exists between psd features i e d std and skw and the attenuation to backscatter ratio so that a limited region for d std values may be associated to a known attenuation to backscatter ratio at a given frequency fig 1 a and b furthermore the normalized attenuation coefficients ζsv and ζss depend on psd features these relationships were presented by guerrero et al 2016 for set of psds similar to those represented in fig 1 a and b therefore the measuring of abr may lead to a likely range of d std values which in turn may be used to estimate the normalized attenuation coefficients this enables solving eq 6 for sediment concentration ms by dividing the sediment attenuation m αs from idb profiling by the normalized attenuation coefficient ζs ζss ζsv eventually reducing the need of frequent calibrations to correct for ζs variations the method presented for the assessment of sediment concentration exploits the attenuation to backscatter ratio and the ζs dependence from the independent variables consisting in psd features at a given frequency the method is exemplified by the abacus in fig 3 a which locates the set of psds listed in table 1 in terms of abr and ζs values at 0 5 mhz notice that d becomes finer while moving from left to right along each of the reported lines i e d std lines in fig 3 a for the indicated std values d changes within ranges as listed in table 1 specifically the abacus in fig 3 a is used through the following steps i the measured abr is entered in the graph vertical line pointing the x axis ii the actual psd and corresponding d std values are located by intersecting the vertical line with d std lines see the elliptical region in fig 3 a iii a range of values for ζs is obtained by bounding a segment on the y axis that is the projection of the located region of psd on the y axis this evaluation is used in turn for the assessment of sediment concentration the same attenuation to backscatter ratio may correspond to a variety of ζs values depending on the most likely psds for example upon entering a starting value of abr 105 the graphical solution as sketched in fig 3 a gives ζs 0 025 0 032 m2 kg where the low value is for relatively coarse d equal to about 100 µm and well sorted particles i e std 0 0 4 µm and 0 032 corresponds to d values of 1 10 µm and wider psd i e std 1 5 µm however aiming to predict ζs for an accurate assessment of sediment concentration this range appears narrow when compared to the overall ζs variation ranging from 0 003 to 0 1 m2 kg in addition a linear law may be argued between the attenuation to backscatter ratio and ζs this relationship may be experimentally validated in real application in the field on the basis of sampled psds for example a relevant widening of the psd i e for increasing std corresponds to a moderate upward shift of the linear relation valid for mono size particles the ζs prediction becomes uncertain for low values of the attenuation to backscatter ratio i e abr 10 which results in a large ζs variation ζs 0 003 0 1 m2 kg for small changes of abr fig 3 a where abr 10 in this range the corresponding assessment of suspended sediment concentration is unreliable in turn this implies a negligible viscous dissipation coefficient ζsv as showed in fig 3 b that is the case for medium coarse sand and finer particles characterized with very poorly sorted psds i e std 24 5 µm 2 4 the backscatter ratio using a higher frequency the use of double frequency for the mapping of sand concentration gradients across a river channel was originally suggested by guerrero et al 2013b the method proposed by these authors relies on a scarce attenuation effect and on a well sorted psd a specific assumption which is consistent for suspended sand guerrero et al 2016 in variance with guerrero et al 2013b in this study the prediction of the normalized attenuation coefficient is the basis for a reliable assessment of sediment concentration by idb profiling in a water volume containing a homogeneous suspension this is consistent with a correct measuring process also in regions with an expected heterogeneous distribution of concentration as the support volume scale of the measure may be considered as a point wise within a varying concentration field this may be the case of an acoustic beam ensonifying a horizontal alignment at a sufficient distance from the riverbed i e with reduced heterogeneity due to resuspension processes and propagating into a highly turbulent and mixed region a second pertinent example is the monitoring of flood events when again a nearly point wise measurement is taken in a fixed position to eventually deliver a time series for sediment concentration at a single spatial location the prediction of the normalized attenuation coefficient appears unreliable for abr 10 fig 3 a which corresponds to negligible viscous dissipation fig 3 b and relevant scatter dissipation in this case ζs can be extracted from the ratio of backscatters bbr at two well spaced frequencies 8 0 over 0 5 mhz fig 4 a this is trivial for coarse or poorly sorted psd yielding the prevailing of scatter over viscous attenuation and bbr versus ζs and ζss linear relationships for bbr 103 these relationships are reported in fig 4 a and b for the same psd set of fig 3 a and b bbr 103 also corresponds to abr 10 as evident upon comparing fig 3 a and b with fig 4 a and b respectively in this condition bbr 103 starting from a measured value for bbr on the x axis the abacus in fig 4 a gives the normalized attenuation coefficient ζs on y axis which in turn enables the calculation of the suspended sediment concentration ms by means of eq 6 3 laboratory tests laboratory tests were conducted under controlled conditions to validate this measurement technique the test specific objectives were to prove that i the single frequency attenuation to backscatter ratio does not depend on concentration ii the latter ratio provides information about the psd in suspension to be applied for the assessment of concentration iii dual frequency backscatter ratio extends the method s applicability in the range of low abr the use of these ratios enables the assessment of concentration for a wide spectrum of psds through idb profiling in homogenous suspensions towards these objectives two acoustic probes working at 0 5 and 8 0 mhz namely dop and lisst abs were combined in the mixing cylindrical tank fig 5 a of the laboratory of hydraulic engineering of the university of bologna the experimental apparatus and procedure are described in section 3 1 whereas the use of dop and lisst abs and following data analyses are separately reported in sections 3 2 and 3 3 respectively 3 1 suspended sediment mixing facility and testing procedure the two probes were deployed side by side from a sealed window fig 5 b and c at 1 m level of the 3 5 m tall and 1 m diameter mixing tank the cylindrical tank was equipped with a upward propeller to maintain in suspension the injected sediment and with a pump collecting and circulating the settling sediment from the collector conic bottom to the injection section at cylinder top each test consisted in the consecutive injections of sediment volumes achieving 50 150 300 600 mg l concentrations for three different psds in a couple of cases higher concentrations of 870 and 1200 mg l were also produced the three simulated psds ranged from well sorted quasi gaussian distribution of fine sand to poorly sorted and asymmetric distributions of clay fig 6 for sake of simplicity these psds will be referred to hereafter as clay silt and sand psd although this classification usually refers to volume or weight distributions rather than to number distributions indeed the number distributions were used to assess the acoustic parameters therefore d std and skw indicated the mean size standard deviation and skewness of number distributions as for the simulated psd table 1 each test started with clear water from aqueduct and was repeated 4 times for sand and 5 times for silt to verify the experimental procedure repeatability experiments with sand included a high concentration test with 1200 mg l last one clay test was performed starting from 50 mg l and ending with 870 mg l to equalize the aqueduct water 5 10 h of mixing were preliminary required eventually reducing to negligible levels the scattering from air bubbles and other impurities before the initial sediment injection of 50 mg l data from lisst abs and dop were continuously acquired during 7 9 min periods a homogenous concentration was reached before the following injection suspended sediment equalization within the tank took few seconds the recordings during these equalization periods were discarded from following analyses water temperature was continuously monitored and fell in the range 18 c 24 c the increase of water temperature due to the mixer pump heating up was considered when accounting for viscous effects modification 3 2 the 0 5 mhz dop the dop by signal processing s a lausanne switzerland was originally designed to profile flow velocities at typical laboratory scale i e 1m 1 mm by applying the doppler effect with a variety of probes characterized by frequencies from 10 to 0 5 mhz in addition the dop also gives the echo intensity modulus i e idb along the ranging distance a 0 5 mhz probe was coupled side by side with the lisst abs fig 5 b that continuously measured idb profiles with a 4 4 mm resolution and up to the ranging distance of about 0 15 m mostly overlapping the lisst abs measurement volume a recorded ensemble of 0 06 s included 128 measured single profiles the recording period for a single concentration value following the sediment injection was 7 minutes in this period 128 ensembles were equally spaced at 3 4 s acquiring time in some cases the recorded ensembles were increased up to 2000 that required a more frequent acquisition and up to 9 min of recording period however no relevant modifications were observed in the time averaged profiles along the 7 9 min recording period these time averaged profiles were used for the investigation of the suspended sediment acoustic parameters which are embedded in the backscattering strength and sediment attenuation terms of eq 3 in fact the idb time averaged profiles from dop are modelled with a two parameters function n and m in eq 8 eqs 3 and 5 were substituted into eq 6 that in turn gave the working form eq 8 for the evaluation of n and m 8 n 20 l o g r ψ 20 l o g e 2 r α w m i d b c these evaluations yield the attenuation to backscatter ratio at 0 5 mhz by means of eq 7 the dop has the capability of automatically adjust the emitted intensity gain this effect may deteriorate the correlations between measured idb profiles and the acoustic parameters of sediment suspensions to account for this deterioration the raw data from dop were preliminary sorted by excluding idb high values close to the saturation level for the receiving sensor as these values were not affected by suspended sediment injection this effect was particularly frequent for the low concentration of 50 mg l and coarsest psd where indeed a negligible sound attenuation due to suspended particles was expected at 0 5 mhz hanes 2012 in these cases the dop automatically adjusted the emitted intensity gain to obtain an appreciable echo intensity level along the entire ranging distance the adjustment gave a good instrument sensitivity to doppler velocity but didn t reflect sediment content in the water volume in addition to instrumental gain water density structures e g flocs temperature gradients and air bubbles may affect sound propagation guerrero et al 2017 eventually uncorrelating the acoustic parameters of sediment i e bsdb and αs from n and m coefficients derived from idb profiles these occurrences required an analysis of the actual effect of sediment injection on idb profiles the investigation was performed by verifying the correlation among the known sediment parameters and the variations of coefficients n and m in eq 8 for a changing concentration i e for additional injections of sediment during tests therefore the obtained n and m coefficients were referred to zero by subtracting their average value for a single test and then compared to corresponding bsdb and αs values in this manner only changes in the values of the coefficients accounted for sediment injections whereas their total values may have depended on instrumental gain change and other variable conditions that differently affected the sound propagation process during tests 3 3 the 8 0 mhz lisst abs the lisst abs by sequoia scientific inc bellevue wa usa measures idb profiles at 8 0 mhz along short ranges of 5 10 cm unfortunately raw data of measured profiles are not made available from the manufacturer but a concentration assessment is directly delivered this device produces a corrected backscattering strength value that gives the concentration at each second on the basis of the backscatter coefficient ks 2 fixed equal to about 0 3 m2 kg i e in house calibration sequoia 2015 conevski et al 2016 the concentration values as provided by lisst abs were used to obtain the actual corrected backscattering strength bs at the high frequency of 8 0 mhz bs was the concentration output times 0 3 that corrected for the in house calibration in fact eqs 2 and 4 may be recast into eq 9 which yields the corrected backscattering strength bsdb as evaluated by lisst abs and the concentration value c as provided by the same device eq 10 9 b s d b 10 l o g k s 2 m s i d b c 20 l o g r ψ 20 l o g e r d i d b d r 10 c b s 0 3 bs in eq 10 is simply the backscattering strength in neper rather than in db therefore the actual concentration for suspended sediment characterized with a certain backscatter coefficient ks 2 was equal to 0 3 times the lisst abs reading of concentration c divided by the actual backscatter coefficient ks 2 aiming to combine the corrected backscattering strength at 8 mhz with the acoustic parameters from time averaged dop profiles at 0 5 mhz the lisst abs measurements were time averaged in the same manner as the idb profiles from dop 4 results results are presented in three subsections section 4 1 focuses on n and m evaluations from idb profiling by dop which are the estimations for bsdb and αs at 0 5 mhz for the following abr assessment the lisst abs results in terms of bsdb at 8 mhz are presented in section 4 2 these two sections summarize the measured parameters to be applied for abr and bbr assessments which enable the concentration quantification as described in the proposed methodology sections 2 3 and 2 4 at the same time these sections report on instrumental accuracies finally in section 4 3 the resulting abr bbr values and concentrations are compared to corresponding known values 4 1 suspended sediment acoustic parameters from idb profiles at 0 5 mhz the time averaged idb profiles from dop were modelled by the quasi linear function reported in eq 8 a typical result is shown in fig 7 for one test with silt psd data fitting returned an average root mean square errors rmse in the range of 11 14 of the observed idb variations along the ranging distance noteworthy rmses usually increased for low concentration values because of the reduced effect of suspended sediment on measured echo intensities however the rmse was always lower than 30 except for few profiles where suspended sediment effect on sound propagation were most likely overwhelmed by noises e g instrumental gain air bubbles not well homogenized temperature gradients eventually resulting in water density structures these profiles were not validated and therefore discarded from further analyses the validated idb profiles produced n and m values which are estimations for bsdb and αs at 0 5 mhz these indirect estimations were compared with the evaluation of the same acoustic parameters as directly resulting from the theoretical concentrations corresponding to injected sediment volume of used psds fig 8 aiming to filter out additional effects on sound propagation other than suspended sediment n and m coefficients in fig 8 were referred to zero by subtracting their average value for a single test the correlation coefficients among direct and indirect evaluations and the corresponding significance levels confirmed a relevant effect of suspended sediment on measured profiles in fact these coefficients resulted always larger than 0 8 and the corresponding significance levels i e p values lower than 0 05 see table 2 finer psds i e clay and silt gave higher correlation coefficients and lower p values both for the backscattering strength and the attenuation coefficient reflecting a strong effect of these particles on the measured profiles at 0 5 mhz for sandy psd the correlations and corresponding significance levels appeared good enough corroborating the hypothesis that the measured echo intensity profiles were primarily affected by the concentration of the experimental suspensions the linear relationships in fig 8 a and b enabled the indirect assessment of bsdb and αs starting from the evaluation of n and m coefficients those relationships may represent the dop calibration in a procedure aimed for the estimation of suspended sediment concentration from idb profiling the indirect and direct assessments of those acoustic parameters are compared in fig 9 a and b when comparing the very good and fair agreements in fig 9 a and b respectively two different scales must be considered in fact the backscattering strength and the attenuation coefficient are usually expressed in logarithmic and linear scales respectively fig 9 a and b this entails a similar degree of accuracy for the indirect assessment of bsdb and αs notwithstanding the larger deviations in fig 9 b the indirect assessment of the backscattering strength and sound attenuation bsdb and αs respectively may be further applied to infer the suspended sediment concentration as for example the bsdb and αs indirect assessments were compared to known concentrations fig 10 a and b for the performed tests these comparisons confirmed different relationships between acoustic parameters and concentration depending on the used psds concluding on that whatever the method used to acoustically infer the suspended sediment concentration the obtained correlations between concentration and the backscattering strength and attenuation coefficient appeared to be psd dependent hence these methods are prone to site and time specific psd in fact the same values for the backscattering strength and attenuation coefficient may correspond to different order of magnitudes for concentration fig 10 a and b this reflects the importance of the backscattering strength coefficient k2 and normalized attenuation coefficient ζs in eqs 5 and 6 respectively 4 2 backscattering strenght at 8 mhz from lisst abs the concentration time series measured with the lisst abs were averaged in the time window corresponding to idb averaged profiles from the dop the resulting time averaged concentrations were converted into backscatter intensity by inverting eq 10 the bsdb value obtained was then compared to the known bsdb values which resulted from known concentrations and psds fig 11 a in addition the backscattering strength from lisst abs were compared to actual concentrations fig 11 b overall the lisst abs gave an accurate prediction of the actual bsdb with an exception for the clay psd fig 11 a in this case the lisst abs underestimated the actual bsdb this may reflect an overestimation of the corresponding attenuation due to suspended sediment and consequently produce a bias in bsdb assessment through eq 7 unfortunately the lisst abs does not provide the raw dataset i e the idb profiles that would make possible an exhaustive analysis of the effects of suspended sediment on sound propagation furthermore density structures due to flocculation temperature and air bubbles may have affected the tests flocculation may be particularly relevant for clay psd a remark that would somehow explain the bsdb deviations for this case although the observed correlations between theoretical and observed data do not appear deteriorated for the same psd when using the 0 5 mhz dop probe table 2 it is worth noting that the measured backscattering strength is not straightforwardly related to suspended sediment concentration fig 11 b in fact three different linear relationships may be argued for the three tested psds this occurrence reflects different backscattering strength coefficients ks 2 for each psd in fact these coefficients were 0 187 0 158 and 0 429 m2 kg for clay silt and sand psds respectively therefore psd specific calibrations for concentration assessment would differ from in house calibration which fixes ks 2 equal to 0 3 m2 kg in other words the lisst abs accuracy depends on the actual psd that is usually unknown when working in the field the deviations of measured concentrations from actual values ranged from about 15 to 100 when passing from sand to clay and increased for low concentrations of sand and high concentrations of clay however herein only the backscattering strength evaluation that does not require a specific calibration is considered in other words the concentration assessment by lisst abs was converted in bs by inversion of eq 10 bs 0 3 c and this removed the bias introduced by an incorrect value of ks 2 4 3 abr at 0 5 mhz and 8 mhz over 0 5 mhz bbr for the assessment of sediment concentration finally the resulting backscattering strengths from the two probes and the attenuation coefficient αs from idb profiling by dop were used for assessing the attenuation to backscatter ratio at 0 5 mhz abr and the 8 mhz over 0 5 mhz backscatter ratio bbr table 3 the concentration ms simplifies in these ratios e g eq 7 so that the final values of abr and bbr thus calculated do not depend on suspended sediment concentration these values described different regions in terms of psd features with respect to simulated psds as reported in table 1 in particular this is true for silt psd that was characterized by a skewness of 23 much larger than the simulated skw equal to 8 on the contrary clay and sand psd represented a poorly sorted fine and a well sorted coarse material respectively and were also included in the simulated psds clay psd was characterized with d std and skw of 2 7 mm 3 5 mm and 9 respectively which is pretty close to simulated psd with std of 3 1 6 1 whereas sand psd is well represented by the simulated mono size distributions these deviations and agreements among represented regions in terms of psd features do not influence the accuracy of the proposed method which is based on accurate values of abr and bbr rather than on the actual psd producing these values table 3 lists the ranges of abr and bbr values obtained experimentally these values changed within three order of magnitudes among the three tested psds and showed a limited variability i e lower than one order of magnitude for each psd this enabled an accurate evaluation of the corresponding normalized attenuation coefficient i e ζsv and ζss that in turn may allow for an accurate assessment of the corresponding concentration further it is seen that clay and silt psd resulted in abr values larger and lower than 10 which suggested the use of the normalized viscous and scatter attenuation coefficient respectively for the inversion of eq 6 this inversion gives the concentration ms sand psd was on the border between the scatter and viscous domains i e abr and bbr equal to about 10 and 103 respectively which suggests using the entire normalized attenuation coefficient i e ζs ζsv ζss for the concentration assessment the graphical method proposed for the evaluation of the normalized attenuation coefficient narrowed the likely range of ζs despite the observed variation in the values of abr and bbr in fact for clay psd an abr in the range of 380 710 resulted in ζsv equal to 0 007 0 012 m2 kg while the actual value was very close to 0 012 m2 kg fig 12 a for silt psd a bbr in the range of 1330 4330 corresponded to ζss equal to 0 010 0 030 m2 kg with the actual value corresponding to the upper end of the range fig 12 b finally the assessment of concentration for sand psd required the evaluation of ζsv and ζss fig 12 a and b to eventually obtain ζs in this case the normalized attenuation coefficient resulted equal to about 0 004 m2 kg with a negligible variation related to the observed deviations of abr and bbr during tests the resulted variations for the normalized attenuation coefficients made the concentration assessment uncertain however the ranges defined for ζsv and ζss considerably narrowed the overall indetermination in the estimated concentrations as shown in fig 13 this fig illustrates for each test the concentration range corresponding to the input range of ζsv and ζss these coefficients may vary within three orders of magnitudes for example ζsv varies in the range of 10 1 10 3 m2 kg rendering the corresponding concentration range very broad with considerable under and over estimations of the actual concentration noticeable improvements i e the best estimations in fig 13 were obtained by applying the estimated ranges of the normalized attenuation coefficients resulting from the proposed method 5 discussion the measuring of sound attenuation αs due to suspended sediment is a promising technique to estimate the concentration of homogenous suspensions this is especially true for fine sediments where the viscous dissipation between particles and water overwhelms the scatter processes i e ζs ζsv ζss see fig 3 a and b unfortunately the relationship between sound attenuation and mass concentration is psd dependent through the normalized attenuation coefficient ζs this may result in deviations of several orders of magnitudes with respect to actual concentration this problem was herein addressed by estimating ζs on the basis of a most likely region in terms of psds features i e mean diameter standard deviation and skewness which in turn was graphically located by evaluating the attenuation to backscatter ratio at 0 5 mhz and the backscatters ratio at 8 mhz and 0 5 mhz in fact these ratios do not depend on concentration but on psd features and can be extracted by backscatter and attenuation measures fig 14 plots the backscattering strength bs at 0 5 mhz versus measured attenuation αs for different concentrations and the three psds used an almost linear fit is evident which would reflect an almost constant abr for each psd although deviations were observed these deviations introduced a certain degree of inaccuracy in the evaluation of the actual concentrations although this was noticeably narrowed with respect to the large indetermination inherent in the overall variation of ζs fig 13 abr deviations were due to dop limitations in fact this device was originally designed to detect a doppler frequency rather than to accurately measure echo levels this also entails a changing gain of the emitted intensity that may mask the effect of suspended sediment on sound propagation eventually resulting in deviations between actual and evaluated attenuations and backscattering strengths fig 9 this was particularly relevant for low concentrations of sand psd when the instrumental gain artificially maintained a high emitted level and resulted in idb saturated profiles the lisst abs showed limitations too this was the case for clay psd where the backscattering strength was underestimated fig 11 a the high attenuation of this fine material most likely reduced the instrument accuracy notwithstanding these limitations the performed experiments showed the improved capability of proposed method to estimate sediment concentration with different psds ranging from clay to fine sand as a matter of fact the deviations from actual concentrations were reduced by a factor of ten when considering the measured values of abr and bbr and corresponding normalized attenuation coefficient ζs this was achieved by means of abr at 0 5 mhz and bbr at two well spaced frequencies 8 mhz 0 5 mhz in particular values of abr larger than 10 at the single frequency gave ζsv for clay psd and sand psd which reduced the deviations from 700 and 200 to 60 and 10 of the actual values respectively and regardless of the tested concentration for lower values of abr ζsv is negligible and the two frequencies were combined to assess ζss by means of bbr 103 as in the case of silt psd the thresholds for abr and bbr resulted in the need of a higher frequency and in large errors of 160 notwithstanding the proposed method represents a noticeable improvement when compared to obtained deviations for the physical limits of ζs equal to 10 1 10 3 m2 kg these deviations resulted equal to twenty times the actual concentrations of silt psd fig 13 the three tested psds served as examples for the applicability of the proposed method in three possible regions table 3 representing prevailing viscous attenuation comparable viscous and scatter attenuations and prevailing scatter attenuation the lisst abs was fairly accurate when measuring the backscattering strength from suspended clay psd this result was not used for the assessment of the normalized attenuation coefficient in fact in this case the abr value at 0 5 mhz accounts for the observed attenuation on the contrary the measurement of backscattering strength at 8 mhz was successfully applied for sand psd and it was even more useful for silt psd in these cases the abr values at 0 5 mhz were close to 10 a single frequency of 0 5 mhz enables quantification of the concentration in a wide range of psds for abr 10 for lower values the normalized attenuation coefficient is fairly related with the attenuation to backscatter ratio in other words a small change of abr close to 10 may change ζs of three order of magnitude fig 3 a similarly abr 108 would result again in an undefined relationship with ζs and a small backscattering strength fairly detected at 0 5 mhz in these cases i e abr 10 and abr 108 the using of abr at a higher and lower frequency respectively may help in maintaining a well defined relationship with ζs furthermore multifrequency may extend the proposed method applicability this was herein tested in case of low abr at 0 5 mhz by switching to 8 mhz 0 5 mhz frequency bbr by using a 8 mhz 0 5 mhz frequency bbr it was possible to compute ζs for silt psd which resulted in a larger interval of variability for the concentration estimation than for clay and sand psd fig 13 this reflects the larger variation of scatter attenuation with respect to viscous attenuation for changing abr and bbr respectively figs 4 b and 3 b therefore the use of dual frequency bbr for the assessment of sediment concentration requires an accurate evaluation of scatter attenuation differently the quantification of concentration by means of single frequency abr appeared less sensitive to measurement inaccuracies as this method relates concentration to viscous attenuation rather than to scatter attenuation the measurement of the attenuation to backscatter ratio at a single frequency may be used to locate the suspended sediment within a region of most likely psds and therefore identify the most accurate method i e abr and bbr based for concentration assessment in fact abr depends on psds features such as the particles mean size and their standard deviation fig 1 a and b for example abr is inversely related to d and std for moderate std and d respectively this is clearly represented in fig 3 a and b where d becomes finer while moving from left to right along each of the reported lines at given std and within very similar ranges as listed in table 1 therefore a decrease in abr would indicate coarsening and widening of the psd this was the case when passing from clay psd to sand psd and silt psd respectively the mean diameter changed from about 3 to 115 µm when passing from clay psd to silt psd whereas skewness considerably changed from 9 for clay to 23 for silt psd the skewness variation indicated a shape change of the psd that was a widening fig 6 a and b 6 conclusions very fine fractions from fine sand to clay represent a large proportion of sediment transported in full suspension and large quantities especially during floods when direct sampling is not possible due to weather and rough conditions of river flow therefore the use of indirect methods using sound attenuation is paramount for the measuring of fine sediment concentration this paper explored the possibility of using a single frequency to accurately evaluate the suspended sediment concentration in case of a variable psd based on the measurement of attenuation to backscatter ratio in homogenous suspensions the proposed method was tested by using a 0 5 mhz probe in laboratory under controlled conditions with three different psds ranging from clay to sand and concentration in the range of 50 1200 mg l these psds represent different regimes in terms of scatter and viscous attenuations the indetermination on concentration assessment was reduced by one order of magnitude when using the information obtained from the abr in addition the combination of backscatter measurement at 8 mhz extended the method applicability to coarser and wider psds based on 8 mhz 0 5 mhz backscattering strengths ratio the single frequency method exhibited lower and upper thresholds in terms of abr values in the range of 101 108 which were related to the mean diameter and standard deviation of psd in fact a decrease of the attenuation to backscatter ratio indicated coarsening and widening of the psd this work advances the use of hydroacoustics to measure suspended sediment in rivers despite the assumption of a homogenous suspension in fact the abr and bbr were evaluated for ensonified water volumes with homogenous concentrations and applied for the first time to estimate the sediment concentration for different particle size distributions the application of this method to spatially varying concentration fields appears possible by evaluating abr and bbr variations along the ensonified range this in turn will require to scale the resolution of acoustic profiling to the expected spatial gradients of sediment concentration to this end further research efforts are needed both in terms of hardware transducers and development of solution methods however the proposed method enables an indirect assessment of sediment concentration that is weakly dependent on the actual psd as a matter of fact the psd dependence is a serious limitation for the accuracy of existing methods using acoustic an laser devices this abr bbr based method will be useful to both practitioners and theoreticians who work in the field of hydroacoustics contributing in advancing our knowledge regarding fluvial processes and the related water resources a further research effort will test the proposed method in the field by using horizontal beams projected from side looking acoustic doppler current profilers that ensonify the water column at a fixed level this would eventually enable the continuous monitoring of flow discharge and the suspension of fine sediment with variable psd transported in full suspension in almost homogenous concentrations

864,the use of acoustic techniques has become common for estimating suspended sediment in water environments an emitted beam propagates into water producing backscatter and attenuation which depend on scattering particles concentration and size distribution unfortunately the actual particles size distribution psd may largely affect the accuracy of concentration quantification through the unknown coefficients of backscattering strength ks 2 and normalized attenuation ζs this issue was partially solved by applying the multi frequency approach despite this possibility a relevant scientific and practical question remains regarding the possibility of using acoustic methods to investigate poorly sorted sediment in the spectrum ranging from clay to fine sand the aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of combining the measurement of sound attenuation and backscatter to determine ζs for the suspended particles and the corresponding concentration the proposed method is moderately dependent from actual psd thus relaxing the need of frequent calibrations to account for changes in ks 2 and ζs coefficients laboratory tests were conducted under controlled conditions to validate this measurement technique with respect to existing approaches the developed method more accurately estimates the concentration of suspended particles ranging from clay to fine sand and at the same time gives an indication on their actual psd keywords backscatter acoustic attenuation suspended sediment particle size distribution 1 introduction reliable data regarding suspended sediment in water environment serves a variety of environmental and engineering practices these include inland navigation guerrero et al 2013a paarlberg et al 2015 sea shoreline protection archetti and romagnoli 2011 carniel et al 2011 erosion hazard mitigation during flood elhakeem et al 2017 irrigation water supply guerrero 2014 habitat and river morphology preservation nones and gerstgraser 2016 haimann et al 2016 guerrero et al 2015 and environmental sustainable hydropower development guerrero et al 2016 felix et al 2016 the direct sampling of the mixture of water and sediment is a challenging task especially during rough climate conditions such as storms and waves in the sea and high discharges and rough water level conditions in a river in addition the continuous monitoring of suspended sediment in a fixed position is hardly achievable by means of physical samples because of the time and effort required for sampling and subsequent laboratory analyses hence indirect methods for the quantification of suspended sediment have been noticeably improved in the last decades focusing on acoustic and optical techniques as to the acoustic methods the assumptions made regarding the actual particle size distribution psd of the suspended sediment guerrero et al 2016 eventually enable an accurate inversion of the sonar equation thorne and hurther 2014 therefore the reliability of acoustic methods largely depends on the validity of these assumptions two main approaches exist the backscatter method and the attenuation method for the first the suspended sediment concentration was successfully correlated to the measured backscattering strength i e a logarithmic form of the backscatter that may be corrected by considering attenuation processes due to suspended particles indeed the acoustic backscatter depends in addition on psd guerrero et al 2016 thorne and meral 2008 this occurrence may undermine the mentioned correlation however using a multi frequency approach the indetermination related to the actual psd may be solved guerrero et al 2013b thorne and hanes 2002 thosteson and hanes 1998 to some degree although this may not be feasible when using few frequencies for poorly sorted sediment i e wide psd even so the multi frequency approach was validated for the investigation of suspended sand from riverbed or in the nearshore region the second approach attenuation is based on scatter attenuation that spreads energy out of the incident beam and the viscous dissipation as result of the friction produced by particles to fluid relative motions this approach was developed for a prevailing attenuation effect due to suspended fine fractions i e clay and silt which dominates the acoustic beam propagation into a homogenous concentration in this case the measured attenuation was correlated to sediment concentration the backscatter gradient along the beam being negligible this attenuation method was successfully applied for the monitoring of fine sediment concentration during flood events in rivers wright et al 2010 moore et al 2012 by relaying on the fact that suspended sediment are homogenously distributed along horizontal alignments unfortunately the sound attenuation depends on psd too which again raises questions on the reliability of acoustic methods when using a single frequency in case of changing psd during the monitored period although the ensonified volume may be limited to a region where homogenous concentration is expected eventually resulting in a punctual measurement whatever the method used the obtained correlations between sediment concentration and measured backscatter and attenuation are site and time specific for example the attenuation effect due to clay silt fractions should be calibrated when trying to correlate sand concentration to single and multi frequency backscatter for the attenuation approach the correlation between attenuation and concentration should be validated in the field that accounts for the actual psd these facts may require frequent and dense sampling to keep the assessed calibration validated accounting for psd change and the actual distribution of concentration along the acoustic beam this in turn makes the use of acoustic methods tricky interfering with the objective of substituting the physical sampling with indirect methods therefore despite the recent advancements in acoustic methods for suspended sediment assessment further research efforts in this area are justified by the objective of improving the reliability of these methods for poorly sorted psds lowering at the same time the need of calibration on the basis of frequent and dense samples in this regard this paper reports on the possibility of simultaneously characterizing particles size distribution and concentration by combining attenuation and backscatter measurements a novel acoustic method significantly reducing the estimation sensitivity to actual psd is proposed for the estimation of suspended sediment concentration the method is based on attenuation to backscatter ratio at a single frequency which straightforwardly defines the acoustic parameter correlating the measured attenuation to sediment concentration for a wide range of psds ranging from clay to sand and with changing width i e variable standard deviation in addition the ratio of backscatters at two well spaced frequencies is used to further extend the range of applicability of the method toward wider psds the method exhibits a modest dependence on the actual psd therefore providing two benefits as it i lowers the need of case specific calibrations ii offers a reliable estimation of concentration and an indication regarding the size distribution of suspended sediment in sum a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches is proposed to advance the fundamental understanding of the interaction of suspended sediment with ultrasound in water environment the measure of ultrasound intensity within water is used to indirectly quantify the concentration of suspended sediment an issue which is relevant in a variety of basic processes and applications regarding water resources in particular the method is novel in that the ratio of acoustic attenuation to backscatter is applied for the first time to estimate the sediment concentration for different psds advancements are achieved is a two levels first different psds are simulated and tested in the laboratory exploring a variety of combinations of mean sizes and standard deviations to represent the most likely conditions typical of actual rivers secondly further steps are taken towards the complete validation of an integrated theoretical experimental approach to measure suspended sediment in rivers paving the way for field applications the proposed method will be useful to both practitioners and theoreticians who work in the field of hydroacoustics thus contributing to the advancement of knowledge regarding fluvial processes and related water resources the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 summarizes the background for acoustic methods and describes the proposed methodology for a reliable assessment of concentration using the attenuation to backscatter ratio at a single frequency and the dual frequency backscatter ratio section 3 describes the laboratory setup and tests conducted to validate the method the results obtained are presented and examined in section 4 section 5 presents a general discussion on the proposed method its advancements and limitations focusing on the possibility of extracting information regarding the psd and on the use of multifrequency to further enlarge the method applicability a set of conclusions and perspectives for future work closes the paper section 6 2 the acoustic method in this section the basic aspects regarding the underwater propagation of sound are firstly presented by introducing the sonar equation section 2 1 then the physical meaning of the attenuation to backscatter ratio at given frequency is presented section 2 2 and the effects of psd changes on coefficients of backscattering strength ks 2 and normalized attenuation ζs are described the use of the attenuation to backscatter ratio at 0 5 mhz for the inversion of the sonar equation is illustrated in section 2 3 the method consists of three steps i the determination of the most likely psd affecting the sound propagation ii the quantification of ζs and iii the assessment of corresponding sediment concentration finally an alternative approach to evaluate the sediment concentration in case of low ζs at 0 5 mhz is explored in section 2 4 the method employs a higher frequency i e 8 mhz to infer the ratio between backscattering strength coefficients at 8 mhz and 0 5 mhz 2 1 acoustic scattering and attenuation for readers convenience only the basic aspects are reported here regarding the theory of sound scattering from a water particles mixture exhaustive studies may be found in technical scientific books medwin and clay 1998 urick 1997 urick 1948 and in more recent review papers thorne and hurther 2014 thorne and meral 2008 thorne and hanes 2002 the sound intensity received by an acoustic system i depends on i the reference pressure p0 at unity distance r0 and the acoustic system settings i e amplifier gain transmit power and pulse length that may be represented with a constant value kt for a given system setting ii the ability of suspended particles to scatter sound back to a mono static transducer i e backscattering strength at a distance r iii the two way round trip attenuation iv the geometrical spreading this relationship is expressed by eq 1 which is derived by e g thorne and hanes 2002 and is usually referred as the sonar equation 1 i p 0 2 r 0 2 k t 2 k s 2 m s r 2 ψ 2 e 4 α w α s r where i the backscattering coefficient ks 2 times the mass concentration ms is the backscattering strength ii α w and α s are the water viscosity and suspended sediment attenuation coefficients respectively iii r2ψ2 is the geometrical spreading that includes the near field correction coefficient ψ downing et al 1995 in the far field ψ 1 it is worth noting that much of the existing acoustics literature reports logarithmic forms of the sonar equation including the target strength or an equivalent decibel expression of the backscattering strength that is ten times the common logarithm of ks 2ms this is because the echo intensity level e spans a wide range of orders of magnitude and an hydrophone usually gives the received sound intensity in a db scale idb guerrero et al 2017 latosinski et al 2014 szupiany et al 2016 as reported in eq 2 2 i d b c 10 l o g k s 2 m s 20 l o g r ψ 20 l o g e 2 α w α s r where c accounts for instrumental specific parameters i e p0 r0 and kt in eq 1 suspended sediment features i e concentration and psd were grouped on the left hand side of eq 3 these are embedded in the backscattering strength i e b s d b 10 l o g k s 2 m s in db and the sediment attenuation coefficient αs which in turn is given by the mass concentration times the sum of normalized scatter and viscous attenuation coefficients ζss and ζsv respectively i e α s ζ ss ζ sv ms in neper m the received sound intensity in a db scale the beam spreading and the sound attenuation in clear water modelled according to medwin and clay 1998 were grouped at the right hand side which is a known term 3 10 l o g k s 2 m s 20 l o g e 2 r ζ s s ζ s v m s i d b c 20 l o g r ψ 20 l o g e 2 α w r different relationships exist for the backscattering strength and for the two additive mechanisms producing the attenuation the scatter attenuation that spreads energy out of the incident beam and the viscous dissipation resulting from the friction produced by particles to fluid relative motions thorne and meral 2008 moore et al 2012 hanes 2012 these relationships eventually depend on the applied acoustic frequency and the actual psd yielding the backscattering coefficient as well as the normalized scatter and viscous attenuation coefficients guerrero et al 2016 these normalized coefficients give the normalized attenuation coefficient ζs which multiplies the suspended sediment concentration ms yielding the attenuation term as reported on the left hand side of eq 3 2 2 the attenuation to backscatter ratio at single frequency for an acoustic beam ensonifying a homogeneous concentration of a multi size mixture of sediments the backscattering strength and sediment attenuation coefficients are not range r dependent in this case the idb profile corrected for instrumental constants the beam spreading and the water viscosity attenuation term gives an estimation of the difference between the backscattering strength and the sediment attenuation term at given concentration that is the left hand side of eq 3 this difference recasts into a ratio when passing from the decibel expression as reported in eq 3 to the backscattering strength i e k s 2 m s in particular it is worth noting that the attenuation to backscatter ratio at a given frequency and for homogeneous concentration depends on the actual psd and can be estimated from idb profiling this was first pointed out by guerrero et al 2017 although without an exhaustive presentation of the relations among attenuation to backscatter ratio ζs ks 2 and psd features i e mean size standard deviation skewness these relations are derived and illustrated in the present paper figs 1 a b 2 a and b by assessing ks 2 ζss and ζsv values according to thorne and meral 2008 and for a variety of psds instrumental frequencies ranging from 0 5 to 8 mhz are considered covering well typical adcp frequencies and including the frequencies used in laboratory tests presented herein most importantly the sorting of suspended sediment largely affects the acoustic parameters and therefore the attenuation to backscatter ratio to illustrate this dependency a number of psds are considered table 1 firstly a mono size distributions from 1 to 3000 µm is adopted to represent a theoretically simple condition furthermore the log normal function is used to simulate a variety of distributions corresponding to real sediment suspensions in this case the psd mean diameter d changes from 0 6 to about 100 µm the corresponding standard deviations std are within the range 0 4 24 5 µm while skewness skw is equal to 8 overall the mono size and log normal distributions represent a wide set of conditions from poorly sorted clay i e 0 4 µm 24 5 µm and 8 for d std and skw respectively to well sorted sand i e 100 3000 µm mono sizes which is a decreasing sorting for fining sediment as it is usually observed in riverine environment the attenuation to backscatter ratio is plotted versus psd mean size or standard deviation to illustrate its dependency on the simulated psd for a given frequency of 0 5 mhz fig 1 a and b the attenuation to backscatter ratio decreases for coarsening mean size fig 1 a and for a widening of the corresponding distributions fig 1 b in more detail psds group in lines with different slopes characterized by a given std and d fig 1 a and b respectively for example the attenuation to backscatter ratio noticeably decreases for a coarsening of mono size psd i e for std 0 in fig 1 a on the contrary the same ratio is almost constant for large standard deviations i e for std 24 5 in fig 1 a in addition an increase in the psd width larger std implies a significant decrease of the attenuation to backscatter ratio for fine psds i e d 0 6 in fig 1 b while corresponding to an almost constant ratio for coarse mean sizes i e d 90 in fig 1 b an attenuation to backscatter ratio decreasing with increasing d and std is therefore evident within a certain range of d and std the ratio then flattens for finer and well sorted sediment respectively the dependency of the attenuation to backscatter ratio on the applied frequency can be observed in fig 2 a and b in this case the attenuation to backscatter ratio values were assessed for the same psds i e d std and skw values similar to table 1 and for two well spaced frequencies i e 0 6 and 1 2 mhz the relationships among the attenuation to backscatter ratio and d std values resulted in different lines in fig 2 a and b these lines exhibit an upwards shift for the lower frequency of 0 6 mhz which reflects an increased weight of the attenuation processes over backscattering strength at low frequency 2 3 assessment of suspended sediment concentration the possibility of single frequency acoustic measurement of sand and clay concentrations in uniform suspensions was discussed by hanes 2012 the use of horizontal aligned beams was proved to work for concentration assessment during flood events moore et al 2012 this method relies on the derivative of a simplified version of eq 3 valid for a homogenous content of suspended sediment in this case the change of backscattering strength is negligible along the ranging distance and the suspended sediment concentration easily relates to the measured profile slope didb dr through the attenuation coefficient αs guerrero et al 2017 as shown in eq 4 4 α s m s ζ s s ζ s v α w 1 2 r 1 40 log e d i d b d r eq 4 yields the sediment concentration by measuring the slope of sound intensity corrected for beam spreading 1 2r and the clear water attenuation αw that sum up in the right hand side term the sediment concentration is the right hand side term divided by the normalized attenuation coefficient ζs ζss ζsv this simplified inversion of the sonar equation is possible for a known value of ζs which needs to be previously fixed by site specific and periodic calibrations the method previously proposed herein provides an estimation of ζs to be applied in eq 4 starting from the same eq 3 a trivial finding is that a straight line fit in the form mx n may be used in the idb r quadrant in this case the idb profiling corrected for beam spreading and clear water attenuation i e the right hand side of eq 3 may be modelled with the correct backscattering strength and sediment attenuation on the left hand side of eq 3 which are the intercept n and the slope coefficient m of a quasi linear fitting therefore the tests performed consisted in idb profiling through homogenous concentrations which enabled the concurrent assessment of the backscattering strength and sediment attenuation by simply finding the best fitting of eq 3 this also provided a measurement of the attenuation to backscatter ratio abr ζs ks 2 this acronym indicates the value obtained from echo profiling rather than the assessment based on known psds in fact abr is derived from the ratio of the slope to intercept coefficients where the suspended sediment concentration cancels out eqs 5 7 5 n 10 l o g k s 2 m s b s d b 6 m ζ s s ζ s v m s α s 7 a b r m 10 n 10 ζ s s ζ s v m s 10 10 log k s 2 m s 10 ζ s k s 2 as already mentioned a non trivial relation exists between psd features i e d std and skw and the attenuation to backscatter ratio so that a limited region for d std values may be associated to a known attenuation to backscatter ratio at a given frequency fig 1 a and b furthermore the normalized attenuation coefficients ζsv and ζss depend on psd features these relationships were presented by guerrero et al 2016 for set of psds similar to those represented in fig 1 a and b therefore the measuring of abr may lead to a likely range of d std values which in turn may be used to estimate the normalized attenuation coefficients this enables solving eq 6 for sediment concentration ms by dividing the sediment attenuation m αs from idb profiling by the normalized attenuation coefficient ζs ζss ζsv eventually reducing the need of frequent calibrations to correct for ζs variations the method presented for the assessment of sediment concentration exploits the attenuation to backscatter ratio and the ζs dependence from the independent variables consisting in psd features at a given frequency the method is exemplified by the abacus in fig 3 a which locates the set of psds listed in table 1 in terms of abr and ζs values at 0 5 mhz notice that d becomes finer while moving from left to right along each of the reported lines i e d std lines in fig 3 a for the indicated std values d changes within ranges as listed in table 1 specifically the abacus in fig 3 a is used through the following steps i the measured abr is entered in the graph vertical line pointing the x axis ii the actual psd and corresponding d std values are located by intersecting the vertical line with d std lines see the elliptical region in fig 3 a iii a range of values for ζs is obtained by bounding a segment on the y axis that is the projection of the located region of psd on the y axis this evaluation is used in turn for the assessment of sediment concentration the same attenuation to backscatter ratio may correspond to a variety of ζs values depending on the most likely psds for example upon entering a starting value of abr 105 the graphical solution as sketched in fig 3 a gives ζs 0 025 0 032 m2 kg where the low value is for relatively coarse d equal to about 100 µm and well sorted particles i e std 0 0 4 µm and 0 032 corresponds to d values of 1 10 µm and wider psd i e std 1 5 µm however aiming to predict ζs for an accurate assessment of sediment concentration this range appears narrow when compared to the overall ζs variation ranging from 0 003 to 0 1 m2 kg in addition a linear law may be argued between the attenuation to backscatter ratio and ζs this relationship may be experimentally validated in real application in the field on the basis of sampled psds for example a relevant widening of the psd i e for increasing std corresponds to a moderate upward shift of the linear relation valid for mono size particles the ζs prediction becomes uncertain for low values of the attenuation to backscatter ratio i e abr 10 which results in a large ζs variation ζs 0 003 0 1 m2 kg for small changes of abr fig 3 a where abr 10 in this range the corresponding assessment of suspended sediment concentration is unreliable in turn this implies a negligible viscous dissipation coefficient ζsv as showed in fig 3 b that is the case for medium coarse sand and finer particles characterized with very poorly sorted psds i e std 24 5 µm 2 4 the backscatter ratio using a higher frequency the use of double frequency for the mapping of sand concentration gradients across a river channel was originally suggested by guerrero et al 2013b the method proposed by these authors relies on a scarce attenuation effect and on a well sorted psd a specific assumption which is consistent for suspended sand guerrero et al 2016 in variance with guerrero et al 2013b in this study the prediction of the normalized attenuation coefficient is the basis for a reliable assessment of sediment concentration by idb profiling in a water volume containing a homogeneous suspension this is consistent with a correct measuring process also in regions with an expected heterogeneous distribution of concentration as the support volume scale of the measure may be considered as a point wise within a varying concentration field this may be the case of an acoustic beam ensonifying a horizontal alignment at a sufficient distance from the riverbed i e with reduced heterogeneity due to resuspension processes and propagating into a highly turbulent and mixed region a second pertinent example is the monitoring of flood events when again a nearly point wise measurement is taken in a fixed position to eventually deliver a time series for sediment concentration at a single spatial location the prediction of the normalized attenuation coefficient appears unreliable for abr 10 fig 3 a which corresponds to negligible viscous dissipation fig 3 b and relevant scatter dissipation in this case ζs can be extracted from the ratio of backscatters bbr at two well spaced frequencies 8 0 over 0 5 mhz fig 4 a this is trivial for coarse or poorly sorted psd yielding the prevailing of scatter over viscous attenuation and bbr versus ζs and ζss linear relationships for bbr 103 these relationships are reported in fig 4 a and b for the same psd set of fig 3 a and b bbr 103 also corresponds to abr 10 as evident upon comparing fig 3 a and b with fig 4 a and b respectively in this condition bbr 103 starting from a measured value for bbr on the x axis the abacus in fig 4 a gives the normalized attenuation coefficient ζs on y axis which in turn enables the calculation of the suspended sediment concentration ms by means of eq 6 3 laboratory tests laboratory tests were conducted under controlled conditions to validate this measurement technique the test specific objectives were to prove that i the single frequency attenuation to backscatter ratio does not depend on concentration ii the latter ratio provides information about the psd in suspension to be applied for the assessment of concentration iii dual frequency backscatter ratio extends the method s applicability in the range of low abr the use of these ratios enables the assessment of concentration for a wide spectrum of psds through idb profiling in homogenous suspensions towards these objectives two acoustic probes working at 0 5 and 8 0 mhz namely dop and lisst abs were combined in the mixing cylindrical tank fig 5 a of the laboratory of hydraulic engineering of the university of bologna the experimental apparatus and procedure are described in section 3 1 whereas the use of dop and lisst abs and following data analyses are separately reported in sections 3 2 and 3 3 respectively 3 1 suspended sediment mixing facility and testing procedure the two probes were deployed side by side from a sealed window fig 5 b and c at 1 m level of the 3 5 m tall and 1 m diameter mixing tank the cylindrical tank was equipped with a upward propeller to maintain in suspension the injected sediment and with a pump collecting and circulating the settling sediment from the collector conic bottom to the injection section at cylinder top each test consisted in the consecutive injections of sediment volumes achieving 50 150 300 600 mg l concentrations for three different psds in a couple of cases higher concentrations of 870 and 1200 mg l were also produced the three simulated psds ranged from well sorted quasi gaussian distribution of fine sand to poorly sorted and asymmetric distributions of clay fig 6 for sake of simplicity these psds will be referred to hereafter as clay silt and sand psd although this classification usually refers to volume or weight distributions rather than to number distributions indeed the number distributions were used to assess the acoustic parameters therefore d std and skw indicated the mean size standard deviation and skewness of number distributions as for the simulated psd table 1 each test started with clear water from aqueduct and was repeated 4 times for sand and 5 times for silt to verify the experimental procedure repeatability experiments with sand included a high concentration test with 1200 mg l last one clay test was performed starting from 50 mg l and ending with 870 mg l to equalize the aqueduct water 5 10 h of mixing were preliminary required eventually reducing to negligible levels the scattering from air bubbles and other impurities before the initial sediment injection of 50 mg l data from lisst abs and dop were continuously acquired during 7 9 min periods a homogenous concentration was reached before the following injection suspended sediment equalization within the tank took few seconds the recordings during these equalization periods were discarded from following analyses water temperature was continuously monitored and fell in the range 18 c 24 c the increase of water temperature due to the mixer pump heating up was considered when accounting for viscous effects modification 3 2 the 0 5 mhz dop the dop by signal processing s a lausanne switzerland was originally designed to profile flow velocities at typical laboratory scale i e 1m 1 mm by applying the doppler effect with a variety of probes characterized by frequencies from 10 to 0 5 mhz in addition the dop also gives the echo intensity modulus i e idb along the ranging distance a 0 5 mhz probe was coupled side by side with the lisst abs fig 5 b that continuously measured idb profiles with a 4 4 mm resolution and up to the ranging distance of about 0 15 m mostly overlapping the lisst abs measurement volume a recorded ensemble of 0 06 s included 128 measured single profiles the recording period for a single concentration value following the sediment injection was 7 minutes in this period 128 ensembles were equally spaced at 3 4 s acquiring time in some cases the recorded ensembles were increased up to 2000 that required a more frequent acquisition and up to 9 min of recording period however no relevant modifications were observed in the time averaged profiles along the 7 9 min recording period these time averaged profiles were used for the investigation of the suspended sediment acoustic parameters which are embedded in the backscattering strength and sediment attenuation terms of eq 3 in fact the idb time averaged profiles from dop are modelled with a two parameters function n and m in eq 8 eqs 3 and 5 were substituted into eq 6 that in turn gave the working form eq 8 for the evaluation of n and m 8 n 20 l o g r ψ 20 l o g e 2 r α w m i d b c these evaluations yield the attenuation to backscatter ratio at 0 5 mhz by means of eq 7 the dop has the capability of automatically adjust the emitted intensity gain this effect may deteriorate the correlations between measured idb profiles and the acoustic parameters of sediment suspensions to account for this deterioration the raw data from dop were preliminary sorted by excluding idb high values close to the saturation level for the receiving sensor as these values were not affected by suspended sediment injection this effect was particularly frequent for the low concentration of 50 mg l and coarsest psd where indeed a negligible sound attenuation due to suspended particles was expected at 0 5 mhz hanes 2012 in these cases the dop automatically adjusted the emitted intensity gain to obtain an appreciable echo intensity level along the entire ranging distance the adjustment gave a good instrument sensitivity to doppler velocity but didn t reflect sediment content in the water volume in addition to instrumental gain water density structures e g flocs temperature gradients and air bubbles may affect sound propagation guerrero et al 2017 eventually uncorrelating the acoustic parameters of sediment i e bsdb and αs from n and m coefficients derived from idb profiles these occurrences required an analysis of the actual effect of sediment injection on idb profiles the investigation was performed by verifying the correlation among the known sediment parameters and the variations of coefficients n and m in eq 8 for a changing concentration i e for additional injections of sediment during tests therefore the obtained n and m coefficients were referred to zero by subtracting their average value for a single test and then compared to corresponding bsdb and αs values in this manner only changes in the values of the coefficients accounted for sediment injections whereas their total values may have depended on instrumental gain change and other variable conditions that differently affected the sound propagation process during tests 3 3 the 8 0 mhz lisst abs the lisst abs by sequoia scientific inc bellevue wa usa measures idb profiles at 8 0 mhz along short ranges of 5 10 cm unfortunately raw data of measured profiles are not made available from the manufacturer but a concentration assessment is directly delivered this device produces a corrected backscattering strength value that gives the concentration at each second on the basis of the backscatter coefficient ks 2 fixed equal to about 0 3 m2 kg i e in house calibration sequoia 2015 conevski et al 2016 the concentration values as provided by lisst abs were used to obtain the actual corrected backscattering strength bs at the high frequency of 8 0 mhz bs was the concentration output times 0 3 that corrected for the in house calibration in fact eqs 2 and 4 may be recast into eq 9 which yields the corrected backscattering strength bsdb as evaluated by lisst abs and the concentration value c as provided by the same device eq 10 9 b s d b 10 l o g k s 2 m s i d b c 20 l o g r ψ 20 l o g e r d i d b d r 10 c b s 0 3 bs in eq 10 is simply the backscattering strength in neper rather than in db therefore the actual concentration for suspended sediment characterized with a certain backscatter coefficient ks 2 was equal to 0 3 times the lisst abs reading of concentration c divided by the actual backscatter coefficient ks 2 aiming to combine the corrected backscattering strength at 8 mhz with the acoustic parameters from time averaged dop profiles at 0 5 mhz the lisst abs measurements were time averaged in the same manner as the idb profiles from dop 4 results results are presented in three subsections section 4 1 focuses on n and m evaluations from idb profiling by dop which are the estimations for bsdb and αs at 0 5 mhz for the following abr assessment the lisst abs results in terms of bsdb at 8 mhz are presented in section 4 2 these two sections summarize the measured parameters to be applied for abr and bbr assessments which enable the concentration quantification as described in the proposed methodology sections 2 3 and 2 4 at the same time these sections report on instrumental accuracies finally in section 4 3 the resulting abr bbr values and concentrations are compared to corresponding known values 4 1 suspended sediment acoustic parameters from idb profiles at 0 5 mhz the time averaged idb profiles from dop were modelled by the quasi linear function reported in eq 8 a typical result is shown in fig 7 for one test with silt psd data fitting returned an average root mean square errors rmse in the range of 11 14 of the observed idb variations along the ranging distance noteworthy rmses usually increased for low concentration values because of the reduced effect of suspended sediment on measured echo intensities however the rmse was always lower than 30 except for few profiles where suspended sediment effect on sound propagation were most likely overwhelmed by noises e g instrumental gain air bubbles not well homogenized temperature gradients eventually resulting in water density structures these profiles were not validated and therefore discarded from further analyses the validated idb profiles produced n and m values which are estimations for bsdb and αs at 0 5 mhz these indirect estimations were compared with the evaluation of the same acoustic parameters as directly resulting from the theoretical concentrations corresponding to injected sediment volume of used psds fig 8 aiming to filter out additional effects on sound propagation other than suspended sediment n and m coefficients in fig 8 were referred to zero by subtracting their average value for a single test the correlation coefficients among direct and indirect evaluations and the corresponding significance levels confirmed a relevant effect of suspended sediment on measured profiles in fact these coefficients resulted always larger than 0 8 and the corresponding significance levels i e p values lower than 0 05 see table 2 finer psds i e clay and silt gave higher correlation coefficients and lower p values both for the backscattering strength and the attenuation coefficient reflecting a strong effect of these particles on the measured profiles at 0 5 mhz for sandy psd the correlations and corresponding significance levels appeared good enough corroborating the hypothesis that the measured echo intensity profiles were primarily affected by the concentration of the experimental suspensions the linear relationships in fig 8 a and b enabled the indirect assessment of bsdb and αs starting from the evaluation of n and m coefficients those relationships may represent the dop calibration in a procedure aimed for the estimation of suspended sediment concentration from idb profiling the indirect and direct assessments of those acoustic parameters are compared in fig 9 a and b when comparing the very good and fair agreements in fig 9 a and b respectively two different scales must be considered in fact the backscattering strength and the attenuation coefficient are usually expressed in logarithmic and linear scales respectively fig 9 a and b this entails a similar degree of accuracy for the indirect assessment of bsdb and αs notwithstanding the larger deviations in fig 9 b the indirect assessment of the backscattering strength and sound attenuation bsdb and αs respectively may be further applied to infer the suspended sediment concentration as for example the bsdb and αs indirect assessments were compared to known concentrations fig 10 a and b for the performed tests these comparisons confirmed different relationships between acoustic parameters and concentration depending on the used psds concluding on that whatever the method used to acoustically infer the suspended sediment concentration the obtained correlations between concentration and the backscattering strength and attenuation coefficient appeared to be psd dependent hence these methods are prone to site and time specific psd in fact the same values for the backscattering strength and attenuation coefficient may correspond to different order of magnitudes for concentration fig 10 a and b this reflects the importance of the backscattering strength coefficient k2 and normalized attenuation coefficient ζs in eqs 5 and 6 respectively 4 2 backscattering strenght at 8 mhz from lisst abs the concentration time series measured with the lisst abs were averaged in the time window corresponding to idb averaged profiles from the dop the resulting time averaged concentrations were converted into backscatter intensity by inverting eq 10 the bsdb value obtained was then compared to the known bsdb values which resulted from known concentrations and psds fig 11 a in addition the backscattering strength from lisst abs were compared to actual concentrations fig 11 b overall the lisst abs gave an accurate prediction of the actual bsdb with an exception for the clay psd fig 11 a in this case the lisst abs underestimated the actual bsdb this may reflect an overestimation of the corresponding attenuation due to suspended sediment and consequently produce a bias in bsdb assessment through eq 7 unfortunately the lisst abs does not provide the raw dataset i e the idb profiles that would make possible an exhaustive analysis of the effects of suspended sediment on sound propagation furthermore density structures due to flocculation temperature and air bubbles may have affected the tests flocculation may be particularly relevant for clay psd a remark that would somehow explain the bsdb deviations for this case although the observed correlations between theoretical and observed data do not appear deteriorated for the same psd when using the 0 5 mhz dop probe table 2 it is worth noting that the measured backscattering strength is not straightforwardly related to suspended sediment concentration fig 11 b in fact three different linear relationships may be argued for the three tested psds this occurrence reflects different backscattering strength coefficients ks 2 for each psd in fact these coefficients were 0 187 0 158 and 0 429 m2 kg for clay silt and sand psds respectively therefore psd specific calibrations for concentration assessment would differ from in house calibration which fixes ks 2 equal to 0 3 m2 kg in other words the lisst abs accuracy depends on the actual psd that is usually unknown when working in the field the deviations of measured concentrations from actual values ranged from about 15 to 100 when passing from sand to clay and increased for low concentrations of sand and high concentrations of clay however herein only the backscattering strength evaluation that does not require a specific calibration is considered in other words the concentration assessment by lisst abs was converted in bs by inversion of eq 10 bs 0 3 c and this removed the bias introduced by an incorrect value of ks 2 4 3 abr at 0 5 mhz and 8 mhz over 0 5 mhz bbr for the assessment of sediment concentration finally the resulting backscattering strengths from the two probes and the attenuation coefficient αs from idb profiling by dop were used for assessing the attenuation to backscatter ratio at 0 5 mhz abr and the 8 mhz over 0 5 mhz backscatter ratio bbr table 3 the concentration ms simplifies in these ratios e g eq 7 so that the final values of abr and bbr thus calculated do not depend on suspended sediment concentration these values described different regions in terms of psd features with respect to simulated psds as reported in table 1 in particular this is true for silt psd that was characterized by a skewness of 23 much larger than the simulated skw equal to 8 on the contrary clay and sand psd represented a poorly sorted fine and a well sorted coarse material respectively and were also included in the simulated psds clay psd was characterized with d std and skw of 2 7 mm 3 5 mm and 9 respectively which is pretty close to simulated psd with std of 3 1 6 1 whereas sand psd is well represented by the simulated mono size distributions these deviations and agreements among represented regions in terms of psd features do not influence the accuracy of the proposed method which is based on accurate values of abr and bbr rather than on the actual psd producing these values table 3 lists the ranges of abr and bbr values obtained experimentally these values changed within three order of magnitudes among the three tested psds and showed a limited variability i e lower than one order of magnitude for each psd this enabled an accurate evaluation of the corresponding normalized attenuation coefficient i e ζsv and ζss that in turn may allow for an accurate assessment of the corresponding concentration further it is seen that clay and silt psd resulted in abr values larger and lower than 10 which suggested the use of the normalized viscous and scatter attenuation coefficient respectively for the inversion of eq 6 this inversion gives the concentration ms sand psd was on the border between the scatter and viscous domains i e abr and bbr equal to about 10 and 103 respectively which suggests using the entire normalized attenuation coefficient i e ζs ζsv ζss for the concentration assessment the graphical method proposed for the evaluation of the normalized attenuation coefficient narrowed the likely range of ζs despite the observed variation in the values of abr and bbr in fact for clay psd an abr in the range of 380 710 resulted in ζsv equal to 0 007 0 012 m2 kg while the actual value was very close to 0 012 m2 kg fig 12 a for silt psd a bbr in the range of 1330 4330 corresponded to ζss equal to 0 010 0 030 m2 kg with the actual value corresponding to the upper end of the range fig 12 b finally the assessment of concentration for sand psd required the evaluation of ζsv and ζss fig 12 a and b to eventually obtain ζs in this case the normalized attenuation coefficient resulted equal to about 0 004 m2 kg with a negligible variation related to the observed deviations of abr and bbr during tests the resulted variations for the normalized attenuation coefficients made the concentration assessment uncertain however the ranges defined for ζsv and ζss considerably narrowed the overall indetermination in the estimated concentrations as shown in fig 13 this fig illustrates for each test the concentration range corresponding to the input range of ζsv and ζss these coefficients may vary within three orders of magnitudes for example ζsv varies in the range of 10 1 10 3 m2 kg rendering the corresponding concentration range very broad with considerable under and over estimations of the actual concentration noticeable improvements i e the best estimations in fig 13 were obtained by applying the estimated ranges of the normalized attenuation coefficients resulting from the proposed method 5 discussion the measuring of sound attenuation αs due to suspended sediment is a promising technique to estimate the concentration of homogenous suspensions this is especially true for fine sediments where the viscous dissipation between particles and water overwhelms the scatter processes i e ζs ζsv ζss see fig 3 a and b unfortunately the relationship between sound attenuation and mass concentration is psd dependent through the normalized attenuation coefficient ζs this may result in deviations of several orders of magnitudes with respect to actual concentration this problem was herein addressed by estimating ζs on the basis of a most likely region in terms of psds features i e mean diameter standard deviation and skewness which in turn was graphically located by evaluating the attenuation to backscatter ratio at 0 5 mhz and the backscatters ratio at 8 mhz and 0 5 mhz in fact these ratios do not depend on concentration but on psd features and can be extracted by backscatter and attenuation measures fig 14 plots the backscattering strength bs at 0 5 mhz versus measured attenuation αs for different concentrations and the three psds used an almost linear fit is evident which would reflect an almost constant abr for each psd although deviations were observed these deviations introduced a certain degree of inaccuracy in the evaluation of the actual concentrations although this was noticeably narrowed with respect to the large indetermination inherent in the overall variation of ζs fig 13 abr deviations were due to dop limitations in fact this device was originally designed to detect a doppler frequency rather than to accurately measure echo levels this also entails a changing gain of the emitted intensity that may mask the effect of suspended sediment on sound propagation eventually resulting in deviations between actual and evaluated attenuations and backscattering strengths fig 9 this was particularly relevant for low concentrations of sand psd when the instrumental gain artificially maintained a high emitted level and resulted in idb saturated profiles the lisst abs showed limitations too this was the case for clay psd where the backscattering strength was underestimated fig 11 a the high attenuation of this fine material most likely reduced the instrument accuracy notwithstanding these limitations the performed experiments showed the improved capability of proposed method to estimate sediment concentration with different psds ranging from clay to fine sand as a matter of fact the deviations from actual concentrations were reduced by a factor of ten when considering the measured values of abr and bbr and corresponding normalized attenuation coefficient ζs this was achieved by means of abr at 0 5 mhz and bbr at two well spaced frequencies 8 mhz 0 5 mhz in particular values of abr larger than 10 at the single frequency gave ζsv for clay psd and sand psd which reduced the deviations from 700 and 200 to 60 and 10 of the actual values respectively and regardless of the tested concentration for lower values of abr ζsv is negligible and the two frequencies were combined to assess ζss by means of bbr 103 as in the case of silt psd the thresholds for abr and bbr resulted in the need of a higher frequency and in large errors of 160 notwithstanding the proposed method represents a noticeable improvement when compared to obtained deviations for the physical limits of ζs equal to 10 1 10 3 m2 kg these deviations resulted equal to twenty times the actual concentrations of silt psd fig 13 the three tested psds served as examples for the applicability of the proposed method in three possible regions table 3 representing prevailing viscous attenuation comparable viscous and scatter attenuations and prevailing scatter attenuation the lisst abs was fairly accurate when measuring the backscattering strength from suspended clay psd this result was not used for the assessment of the normalized attenuation coefficient in fact in this case the abr value at 0 5 mhz accounts for the observed attenuation on the contrary the measurement of backscattering strength at 8 mhz was successfully applied for sand psd and it was even more useful for silt psd in these cases the abr values at 0 5 mhz were close to 10 a single frequency of 0 5 mhz enables quantification of the concentration in a wide range of psds for abr 10 for lower values the normalized attenuation coefficient is fairly related with the attenuation to backscatter ratio in other words a small change of abr close to 10 may change ζs of three order of magnitude fig 3 a similarly abr 108 would result again in an undefined relationship with ζs and a small backscattering strength fairly detected at 0 5 mhz in these cases i e abr 10 and abr 108 the using of abr at a higher and lower frequency respectively may help in maintaining a well defined relationship with ζs furthermore multifrequency may extend the proposed method applicability this was herein tested in case of low abr at 0 5 mhz by switching to 8 mhz 0 5 mhz frequency bbr by using a 8 mhz 0 5 mhz frequency bbr it was possible to compute ζs for silt psd which resulted in a larger interval of variability for the concentration estimation than for clay and sand psd fig 13 this reflects the larger variation of scatter attenuation with respect to viscous attenuation for changing abr and bbr respectively figs 4 b and 3 b therefore the use of dual frequency bbr for the assessment of sediment concentration requires an accurate evaluation of scatter attenuation differently the quantification of concentration by means of single frequency abr appeared less sensitive to measurement inaccuracies as this method relates concentration to viscous attenuation rather than to scatter attenuation the measurement of the attenuation to backscatter ratio at a single frequency may be used to locate the suspended sediment within a region of most likely psds and therefore identify the most accurate method i e abr and bbr based for concentration assessment in fact abr depends on psds features such as the particles mean size and their standard deviation fig 1 a and b for example abr is inversely related to d and std for moderate std and d respectively this is clearly represented in fig 3 a and b where d becomes finer while moving from left to right along each of the reported lines at given std and within very similar ranges as listed in table 1 therefore a decrease in abr would indicate coarsening and widening of the psd this was the case when passing from clay psd to sand psd and silt psd respectively the mean diameter changed from about 3 to 115 µm when passing from clay psd to silt psd whereas skewness considerably changed from 9 for clay to 23 for silt psd the skewness variation indicated a shape change of the psd that was a widening fig 6 a and b 6 conclusions very fine fractions from fine sand to clay represent a large proportion of sediment transported in full suspension and large quantities especially during floods when direct sampling is not possible due to weather and rough conditions of river flow therefore the use of indirect methods using sound attenuation is paramount for the measuring of fine sediment concentration this paper explored the possibility of using a single frequency to accurately evaluate the suspended sediment concentration in case of a variable psd based on the measurement of attenuation to backscatter ratio in homogenous suspensions the proposed method was tested by using a 0 5 mhz probe in laboratory under controlled conditions with three different psds ranging from clay to sand and concentration in the range of 50 1200 mg l these psds represent different regimes in terms of scatter and viscous attenuations the indetermination on concentration assessment was reduced by one order of magnitude when using the information obtained from the abr in addition the combination of backscatter measurement at 8 mhz extended the method applicability to coarser and wider psds based on 8 mhz 0 5 mhz backscattering strengths ratio the single frequency method exhibited lower and upper thresholds in terms of abr values in the range of 101 108 which were related to the mean diameter and standard deviation of psd in fact a decrease of the attenuation to backscatter ratio indicated coarsening and widening of the psd this work advances the use of hydroacoustics to measure suspended sediment in rivers despite the assumption of a homogenous suspension in fact the abr and bbr were evaluated for ensonified water volumes with homogenous concentrations and applied for the first time to estimate the sediment concentration for different particle size distributions the application of this method to spatially varying concentration fields appears possible by evaluating abr and bbr variations along the ensonified range this in turn will require to scale the resolution of acoustic profiling to the expected spatial gradients of sediment concentration to this end further research efforts are needed both in terms of hardware transducers and development of solution methods however the proposed method enables an indirect assessment of sediment concentration that is weakly dependent on the actual psd as a matter of fact the psd dependence is a serious limitation for the accuracy of existing methods using acoustic an laser devices this abr bbr based method will be useful to both practitioners and theoreticians who work in the field of hydroacoustics contributing in advancing our knowledge regarding fluvial processes and the related water resources a further research effort will test the proposed method in the field by using horizontal beams projected from side looking acoustic doppler current profilers that ensonify the water column at a fixed level this would eventually enable the continuous monitoring of flow discharge and the suspension of fine sediment with variable psd transported in full suspension in almost homogenous concentrations
